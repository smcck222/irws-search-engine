<F P=106> [Article by Yusuf al-Sharif: "Islam and the National </F>
Dialogue"] 
  [Text] At the present time, Islam, Islamic societies, and 
organizations for the propagation of Islam in general are facing 
various sorts of crude attacks and clear controversy over their 
motives, tendencies, allegiances, methods, and goals. The 
secularists in Egypt, for example, who reject the idea of a 
religious state, generalize: They do not differentiate between 
the Islamic groups that strive in God's path, with wisdom, 
spiritual counsel, conviction, and good example, and other 
groups that attack society for blasphemy and of pre-Islamic 
apostasy. [They fail to distinguish the danger of those] who 
call for individual interpretation of religion and the right to 
monopolize the propagation of Islam -- those who rush to 
establish Islamic law by violent means and even terrorism! 
  Some secularists think there is an unwritten agreement 
between these groups--those who call for Islamic law by 
democratic and legitimate means and others who employ violence 
and terror. [They think] that each of the two groups is backing 
the other, and that whichever succeeds in attaining power first 
will necessarily and immediately proclaim the unification of the 
Islamic groups. All differences and conflicts between them would 
then disappear. The secularists who hold this opinion offer as 
proof their claim that various violent Islamic groups grew out 
of the Muslim Brotherhood, founded by the late Shaykh Hasan 
al-Banna in the 1940s. They even accuse the Muslim Brotherhood 
of having hatched and nurtured persons who are easy for the 
violent Islamic groups to recruit. 
  There is a regrettable meeting of minds between the 
secularists and the political-Islam groups who pursue democracy 
or violence in their call for social change. They both scorn 
the role of al-Azhar and its esteemed scholars, who have 
understood the sciences of religion through study and the 
attainment of qualifications, who pursue the propagation of the 
faith, religious counseling, and reasoning. The secularists for 
their part reject al-Azhar and its scholars whenever they try to 
correct mistaken ideas, in their preaching, writing, and 
intellectual achievements, as recently happened in the case of 
the television series ["The Family"] that tried to portray the 
phenomenon of terrorism without any familiarity with Islamic 
thinking or with the principles of worship and the 
proportionalities of reward and punishment for one's deeds. This 
sparked a dispute and all kinds of excesses by the secularists 
authors in response to the statement issued by His Excellency 
the Shaykh of al-Azhar in "The Family" series. One author, Wahid 
Hamid, even denied that Islam provides any clear pronouncement 
or allusion about what awaits a deceased person, who had been a 
heretic in this life, in terms of judgement and punishment in 
the grave. And there was the statement issued by the Supreme 
Council on Islamic Affairs, which defended the right of 
religious scholars and their role in combatting the excesses and 
errors in views of Islam, and in monitoring the literary and 
artistic works that exploit the climate of democratic freedoms, 
and distort Islam, the latest of the divinely revealed 
religions, which is valid and applicable at any time and in any 
place. 
  Meanwhile, the general message of the political-Islam groups 
is that they reject al-Azhar and the clerics of the Islamic 
Council, the Dar al-Ifta' [office of the mufti], and the society 
of preachers and those of the Ministry of Awqaf, claiming that 
they represent or express government Islam, and justify or are 
silent regarding government abuses. Islam, they say, does not 
recognize a clerical class; it is thus the right of every Muslim 
to deduce his own interpretation of the faith in his own best 
interests and the interests of other Muslims, even should that 
lead them to prey on society! It is amazing that a writer such 
as Tharwat Abazah, the vice-president of the Consultative 
Council, in an article printed in AL-AHRAM newspaper last week, 
entitled "Art is Integrity," accused factions of the national 
left--Nasirites and communists--of being, in his words, 
"infidels." What can the violent and extremist groups, who 
accuse society of blasphemy and apostasy, do with them, after 
seeing a secularist declare them to be infidels, except 
assassinate them, in accordance with the sentence that they 
claim is their right? When a great Islamic thinker such as Fahmi 
Huwaydi resisted this dangerous distortion of Islam, and called 
for Muslims to unite their visions and efforts to confront the 
dangers facing the Islamic nation, we received, at AL-SHARQ's 
Cairo office, dozens of telephone calls from people demanding 
that we supply them with the last two articles AL-SHARQ printed 
after their publication in other newspapers had been prevented! 
  Why all this distortion, clamor, and conflict over Islam 
now among Muslims in Egypt, secularists, fundamentalists, 
traditionalists, and moderates? Why did this not happen during 
the monarchial era, or at the peak of the July Revolution and 
the leadership of Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir? Perhaps because, in the 
days of the monarchy, the various classes and factions of the 
people had joined the political parties that expressed their 
aspirations and interests, and because the central national 
issue was embodied in the concept and the practices of all the 
popular forces on the achievement of independence and liberation 
from colonialism. Even the Muslim Brotherhood, which represented 
the Islamic political opposition to the existing regime, did not 
resort to accusing society of blasphemy and ignorance. They 
occupied themslves with Islamic education, and its mass 
expansion throughout Egypt, in the hopes of establishing an 
Islamic state through democratic means. 
  Thus the Muslim Brotherhood fought side by side with the 
Egyptian army in the Palestine war, and cooperated with the 
secret Free Officers organization in launching a war of nerves 
against the British occupation all along the Suez Canal. This 
was despite the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood undertook, 
after the martyrdom of Shaykh Hasan al-Banna, and the leadership 
of Counselor Hasan al-Hudaybi, to announce its hostility toward 
the July Revolution, to the point of trying to assassinate Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir and overthrow the regime by force in 1954 and 
1965. The revolution's national achievements and development 
projects surpassed the other parties in terms of establishing 
foundations of social justice; it thus pulled the rug out from 
under their feet, and crushed their former members' mass role, 
influence, and skirting of the revolution. 
  In Islamic terms, Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir was from the very 
beginning keen on the Islamic sphere, its thinking and strategic 
inclinations, side by side with the Arab, African, and 
nonaligned spheres. He extended his hand to support and aid the 
liberation of Islamic peoples from colonialism and backwardness. 
In its time, the Islamic renewal saw the rise of the Supreme 
Council on Islamic Affairs, which revived the Islamic heritage 
and printed thousands of Islamic publications and books. It had 
a plan to develop al-Azhar to graduate thousands of qualified 
doctors, engineers, and religious scholars to undertake the 
propagation of Islam throughout the world, in the languages of 
all its peoples. It established Holy Koran Radio. 
  We therefore believe that the early beginnings of Islamic 
extremism in Egypt were attributable to Anwar al-Sadat, may he 
rest in peace. He was the first to use them, in a Machiavellian 
fashion, to fight his Nasirite and communist enemies. It is he 
who supported them with money and violent means, as his close 
aides have attested. Then they turned against him and became his 
deadly enemies when he visited Jerusalem and signed a separate 
peace with Israel at Camp David, and he was assassinated by 
Islamists, setting off a wave of terror. 
  The picture is different today; the details are less 
distinct, in light of the government's failure to meet society's 
minimum aspirations. It is true that there are great 
achievements, and they keep coming, but they cannot deal with 
the problems, which also keep coming, and grow ever more 
serious. In the absence of a national plan, and frustrations on 
the Arab scene, the climate is ripe for the fragmentation of 
intellectual and ideological unity into scattered, conflicting, 
and struggling pieces. Meanwhile, political parties are merely 
skeletons, or just newspapers or words, incapable of influencing 
the government or the masses. 
  Thus we, and the people of Egypt, rely on the glimmer of 
hope 
emitted by the anticipated national dialogue, which may limit, 
or solve, the problems of intellectual poverty in general, and 
the resulting distortion of Islam in particular. Perhaps the 
first conditions for success and credibility of the national 
dialogue lie in the trust and participation of every person who 
has a vision for Egypt's change for the better, individually or 
collectively, without disqualifying any, according to the 
standard of democracy and political and popular balance.

<F P=106> [Article by Jalal Duwaydar: "Benefiting From the Experience </F>
of Beijing and in the Arab Interest"] 
  [Excerpts] Although President Mubarak's short visit to 
China, which ended yesterday morning, lasted only three days, 
there is a general consensus that it has achieved the desired 
results, and this is something that reflects the profound nature 
of the relations between the two countries and their leaders. 
  The most important thing that distinguishes Egyptian-Chinese 
relations, the roots of which go back dozens of years, is the 
fact that they are based on mutual respect, trust, friendship, 
and common interests. 
  In order that matters be clearly and openly put on the 
table, 
we must remark that President Mubarak, during this trip, has 
expended all possible efforts to enable Egypt to benefit from 
the achievements of the Chinese economic experiment--with all of 
its positive and negative aspects. 
  There also took place, during the visit, the signing of two 
agreements for investment and judicial cooperation between China 
and Egypt. 
  In addition to these two agreements, and by means of the 
discussions and meetings held by President Mubarak with the 
Chinese leaders, a number of policies have been established for 
joint cooperation between the two nations in new areas. 
  More precisely, the efforts undertaken by President Mubarak 
during this exhausting trip--which is only one of the dozens of 
trips he is undertaking for the sake of achieving advancement 
for Egypt's people and solving Egypt's problems--are not 
sufficient, because it is also necessary that the nation's 
executive agencies assume responsibility and move effectively in 
order to carry out, with the necessary speed, what was agreed 
upon. 
  In order to break out of this dead-end situation, agreement 
was reached to form working groups to follow up on the issues of 
joint cooperation. 
  The most important elements of cooperation agreed upon in 
President Mubarak's bilateral discussions with the Chinese 
leaders, which were also expanded to include the participation 
of 'Amr Musa, the minister of foreign affairs, and Safwat 
al-Sharif, the minister of information, were the following: 
  1. Continuation of political coordination concerning Arab, 
African, and world issues. The Chinese expressed their esteem 
and support for Egypt's efforts aimed at achieving a just and 
comprehensive peace in the Middle East. 
  2. The importance of working toward increasing the volume of 
trade between Egypt and China, and increasing the rates of 
Egypt's exports to a degree that reflects the strength of the 
relations between the two nations. 
  3. It was agreed that China will set up free-trade zones in 
Egypt for Chinese industries as a form of investment because of 
Egypt's location and proximity to the markets of Europe, the 
Middle East, and Africa, and it was also agreed that protocols 
dealing with industrial and technical cooperation will be signed. 
  4. Beijing's readiness to cooperate technologically with 
Egypt and to provide all types of possibilities that will help 
Egypt to achieve progress and to benefit from China's pioneering 
experiment in this field. Now it is up to Egypt's government 
organizations to move to seize this available opportunity. 
  5. An exchange of views concerning the problems of 
development and the open-door economic policy. These are 
difficulties that exist in both Egypt and China, and that they 
can find solutions for if they engage in joint efforts. 
  6. Judging by the meetings which took place, it is evident 
that most of the investments made in the new Chinese 
[free-trade] zones have been financed by members of the oversees 
Chinese communities (55 million persons). Also, a large 
percentage was contributed by the Chinese in Thailand and Hong 
Kong, in addition to the capital that comes from Japan and 
Singapore. 
  From the giant nation of China--which is moving firmly and 
steadfastly to take its place among the great powers, which will 
result in the achievement of the balance which is being sought 
in the new world order--President Mubarak has arrived in Abu 
Dhabi, the capital of the fellow-Arab nation of the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE], which has always opened up its heart and its 
arms to Egypt as its Arab big brother. [passage omitted] 
The trips abroad that President Mubarak occasionally takes 
always have the aim of guaranteeing continuity and pursuing 
strong relations of friendship with other nations. This helps 
these other nations to understand Egypt's problems and needs, 
and creates willingness [among them] to support Egypt in many of 
the positions it takes that are connected with the interests of 
the Egyptian people.

<F P=106> [Article by Sa'id Sunbul] </F>
  [Text] The ambassador of China, Yang Fuchang, leaves Cairo 
at the end of this week to go to Beijing in order to participate 
in the reception of President Husni Mubarak during his visit to 
China before the latter part of this month. 
  The Chinese ambassador in Cairo speaks fluent Arabic, and 
even speaks it with an Egyptian accent! He graduated from the 
Department of Arabic in Cairo University's College of Liberal 
Arts in the class of 1962. 
  The ambassador told me that his country was being 
far-sighted 
when it encouraged the Chinese to study Arabic, realizing the 
importance of Egypt and the Arab world. This action took place 
right after our deceased President Nasir had met with the 
Chinese leader Chou En-lai at the Bandung Conference in 1954. In 
that year, the two leaders, during this meeting, agreed to 
establish cultural relations between the two countries, in spite 
of the fact that they did not have political relations. 
  Shaykh Ahmad Hasan al-Baquri, now deceased, traveled to 
Beijing in 1955 at the head of an Egyptian cultural delegation. 
This was the first official delegation to visit China after its 
revolution against, and overthrow of, the regime of Chiang 
Kai-shek. During his stay in Beijing, Shaykh al-Baquri signed a 
cultural agreement with the Chinese Government, according to 
which the two nations agreed to an exchange of cultural 
relations. 
  It was under the terms of this agreement that the Chinese 
Government, in 1956, sent five young Chinese to Cairo to study 
Arabic. Yang Fuchang, China's current ambassador [to Egypt], was 
one of these five young men. After this group, other groups of 
Chinese also came to Cairo to study Arabic, and this process 
continued. 
  In the Chinese Embassy in Cairo there are about eight 
Chinese 
diplomats who read and speak Arabic. This ability of theirs 
enables them to really see what the situation in Egypt is and 
enables them to deal directly with the Egyptians instead of 
using interpreters. 
  In spite of how important China is to us, our embassy in 
Beijing stills deals with Chinese officials and others by means 
of Chinese interpreters! I do not know why the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in Egypt does not draw upon the services of some 
Egyptians who read and speak Chinese. In my opinion, this is 
something that would help Egyptian diplomats to better perform 
their job. 
  When I visited China in September of last year, I found out 
that the government and large companies in both Japan and Korea, 
during the last few years, had begun to send large numbers of 
young people to China to study and learn Chinese in order to 
make it easier for them to deal with China. 
  China is the future. But the problem of dealing with China 
is 
that we do not know the language. I imagine that, during his 
visit to China, President Mubarak will give this matter in 
particular some of his attention, with the result being that 
there will be an increase in the number of groups of Egyptians 
being sent to China to study Chinese. 
  Whoever speaks the language of a country can easily open the 
closed doors of that country!

<F P=106> [Report on speech by President Husni Mubarak before Chinese </F>
media delegation; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] President Husni Mubarak described the relations 
between Egypt and China as being historic relations, since Egypt 
was the first Arab and African nation to recognize the People's 
Republic of China. 
  In a speech to a Chinese media delegation representing 
Chinese media organizations, President Mubarak said that recent 
international developments, both in the Middle East and in East 
Asia, have brought attention to the vital importance of joint 
consultations between Egypt and China for the purpose of 
objectively evaluating these developments and seeking just and 
reasonable solutions from all parties, which would support peace 
and security throughout the world. 
<H5>  More Profound Mutual Understanding With Asia </H5>
  President Mubarak said: "Egypt is an African nation, but it 
is also an Asia nation by virtue of the fact that it is located 
on the crossroads of three major continents. For this reason, 
Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a large number of the 
Islamic nations and peoples in Asia impel Egyptian policy to 
become increasingly interested in achieving more profound ties 
of mutual understanding with the Asian continent." 
  The President added: "The economic and political importance 
of the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, and the degree to 
which they have come to participate in the world's production 
and international trade, leads us to predict that the next 
century will be the century of the Asian continent." 
  The President went on to say: "In light of the traditional 
ties of friendship between Egypt and most of the nations and 
peoples of Asia, Egyptian policy is one of pursuing active 
diplomacy with most of the nations of that continent as well as 
participating with other nations in the search for solutions to 
problems which may appear from time to time." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Deep-Rooted Relations </H5>
  In response to a question concerning the goal and 
significance of his anticipated visit to China, President 
Mubarak said: "Relations between Egypt and China are both 
historical and political. With regard to the historical 
dimension, Egypt was the first Arab and African nation to 
recognize the People's Republic of China." 
  "With regard to the political dimension, the anchor of these 
relations has been a deep-rooted friendship based on 
cooperation, mutual consultation, and coordination regarding the 
various Arab and world issues, due to the major role played by 
China in the world arena and due to the importance of Egypt 
among the Arab and African nations in the Middle East and 
Africa." 
  The president said: "Egyptian-Chinese relations are nearly 
40 
years old. This has been a fertile period, full of developments 
in the world arena in most of the continents of the world and in 
the relations of the superpowers, after the profound and radical 
changes that have taken place in the balance of power that had 
been stable since World War II." 
<H5>  Appraisal of the Situation </H5>
  The president continued: "There is no doubt that the leaders 
of both China and Egypt have their own particular views and 
assessments of the nature of these changes and their likely 
effects on the issues of international and regional security and 
stability in the world as well as issues such as disarmament, 
etc." 
  He added: "Recent international developments in the Middle 
East and East Asia have brought attention to the special 
importance of having mutual consultations between the two 
nations for the purpose of coming up with an objective appraisal 
[of the situation] and seeking just and reasonable solutions 
from all parties which would support peace and security 
throughout the world." 
  President Mubarak then replied to a question from the 
Chinese 
media delegation concerning his appraisal of the current 
situation with regard to Egyptian-Chinese relations and ways 
that would lead to strengthening ties of cooperation between 
Egypt and China during the period of important changes the world 
community is witnessing at the current time: 
<H5>  Mutual Trust </H5>
  "Egyptian-Chinese relations are characterized by a special 
nature that makes them different from bilateral relations that 
we have with many other friendly nations. In addition to the 
ancient historical tradition that each of the two nations has, 
as well as the great degree of mutual trust that has existed 
between the peoples and leaders of the two nations over a period 
of dozens of years, cooperation between the two countries has 
been achieved in many areas of joint action in economic, 
cultural, scientific, and other fields." 
  "Also, there have been many levels of cooperation between 
the 
official agencies and parliamentary, party, and labor union 
organizations. This has created a common basis for mutual 
understanding between the two peoples, which has greatly 
strengthened the firm ties of friendship on the highest levels 
that exist between Cairo and Beijing." 
  President Mubarak continued: "Naturally, if our political 
relations have reached this degree of trust and this height, we 
aspire to have our economic cooperation and trade reach these 
world levels also, taking into consideration the great leap 
achieved by the Chinese economy in growth and prosperity and the 
important steps achieved in the Egyptian economy in recent 
years." 
<H5>  Trade </H5>
  "These two factors should lead to an opening of broad 
horizons and possibilities for the expansion of trade between 
Egypt and China, to an increase in their share of the world's 
trade, benefiting the peoples of the two friendly nations, and 
to benefits being gained from the great technological and 
industrial progress which has been achieved by China in recent 
years." 
<H5>  Experience in Economic Reform </H5>
  Concerning a question about the aspects of similarity 
between 
Egypt's and China's experience with economic reform and what the 
results have been of these experiments in terms of great 
achievements and expertise gained, which could be utilized for 
the mutual benefit of the two nations, President Mubarak said: 
"Egypt, as a developing country, which in the early sixties 
adopted the idea of central planning for its economy, has faced 
big problems and taken on many burdens as a result of the 
numerous armed conflicts that have taken place in the Middle 
East and has had difficulties in connection with developing the 
necessary infrastructure for economic development and increasing 
its rates of growth. In addition to this, in Egypt we have 
experienced a continual increase in our population, which has 
been higher than the rates of our economic growth and which has 
been disportionate to the nation's natural and economic 
resources." 
  "In view of these problems, in the early eighties Egypt 
initiated a comprehensive review of its economic plans and 
programs, bearing in mind the requirements of modern economic 
thought and the application of reform programs in a manner that 
would be in accordance with our particular circumstances and 
social conditions and the needs of our citizens in Egypt." 
  The president went on to say: "With the application of two 
five-year plans since 1982 and the beginning of the third plan 
in 1992, the reaping of the fruits of the monetary, fiscal, and 
structural reform in the Egyptian economy, and the following of 
policies of economic liberalization and privatization in 
accordance with the circumstances of Egyptian society by 
choosing the method of gradual development rather than that of a 
sudden leap, we have been able to restore to the Egyptian 
economy a large measure of its activity, vitality, and ability 
to produce, export, and provide employment opportunities for 
thousands of young people." 
<H5>  Diagnosis and Cure </H5>
  President Mubarak said: "The problems are still not over. 
However, the diagnosis has been accurate and the cure has not 
been a sudden one. Signs of health and strength have begun to 
appear again in the Egyptian economy in the fields of industry, 
agriculture, urban and rural development, and raising the level 
of services. 
  "There is no doubt that the achievement of stability in 
Egypt 
and in the Middle East would provide the climate necessary for 
pushing forward the wheel of economic progress and attracting 
investment." 
<H5>  Similarity in the Two Experiments </H5>
  President Mubarak said: "We find a considerable degree of 
similarity between the Chinese and Egyptian experiments in the 
area of economic reform, in spite of the peculiarities of each 
one. The transition from a policy of central planning to that of 
adopting market mechanisms, giving free rein to individual 
initiative, and having private enterprises, in addition to the 
important role played by community ownership, are among the 
common denominators of the two experiments." 
  President Mubarak added: "The nature of the experiment in 
economic reform in each of the two countries--that is, the 
experiment that took into consideration the special social 
circumstances of the two peoples in Egypt and China, or what we 
call the `social dimension of the process of economic 
development'--was one of the more obvious aspects of similarity 
when it came to correcting the path of the economy and adapting 
it to the new economic circumstances which prevail in the world. 
  "Also, the development of the public sector, the creation of 
free trade zones, the policy of encouraging foreign investments, 
and the development of small industries are features of the 
Chinese experiment that are similar to the models we are 
following, on a smaller scale, of course, in our experiment in 
economic reform in Egypt." 
  President Mubarak asserted: "Both the Egyptian and Chinese 
experiments are the result of the nature of the circumstances of 
economic development in Egypt and China, and are not merely a 
blind response to some plans or advice that might not 
necessarily be appropriate for the distinctive features of the 
two economic experiments." 
<H5>  Egypt's Ties to Asia </H5>
  In response to a question concerning the general principles 
of Egypt's foreign policy and its policy toward the continent of 
Asia, President Mubarak said: "Egypt, as you know, is an African 
nation, but it is also an Asian nation by virtue of its location 
on the crossroads of the three great continents of Asia, Africa, 
and Europe. Furthermore, a part of Egypt's territory--Sinai--is 
in the continent of Asia." 
  He added: "The areas of Egypt's contemporary political 
influence, as well as the realms of Egypt's activity throughout 
the course of history, have been basically Africa and Asia due 
to Egypt's relations with the Arab peoples and nations starting 
many centuries ago and continuing till the present day. 
  "Egypt's ties to the Arab nations in Asia are not merely 
attributable to cultural and historical ties, but are also 
attributable to well-known vital economic interests, since the 
Egyptian economy is affected both directly and indirectly by the 
circumstances of the thousands of expatriate Egyptian workers in 
the Gulf nations. 
  "The developments experienced by the Gulf area since the 
beginning of the eighties have confirmed to what great degree 
the security situation in the Gulf affects the security of the 
Arab world and consequently the security of Egypt, and this was 
clearly shown during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran 
and the Gulf war in 1990." 
<H5>  Cultural and Religious Ties </H5>
  President Mubarak continued: "In addition to this, we of 
Egypt have cultural and religious ties to a large number of the 
Islamic nations and peoples in Asia, and this has impelled 
Egyptian policy to be oriented toward dedicating a large part of 
its concerns and activities to strengthening the bonds of mutual 
understanding between us. 
  "We cannot ignore the economic and political importance of 
the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, ties that have reached 
the point where they account for nearly half of the world's 
production and international trade. This leads us to predict 
that the 21st century will truly be the century of the continent 
of Asia, which is witnessing the appearance of large economic 
blocs. 
  "Because of all these objective considerations and in light 
of the traditional relations of friendship that have linked 
Egypt to most of the nations and peoples of Asia for a long 
time, Egyptian policy is pursuing an active diplomacy with most 
of the nations of the [Asian] continent on the political, 
economic, and cultural levels. For the sake of achieving 
security and stability in this continent, which is inhabited by 
most of the world's population, Egypt is exchanging visits and 
delegations with these nations and is following their 
developments with great interest, and is participating along 
with other nations and organizations of the international 
community in the search for solutions to the problems that may 
appear from time to time." [passage omitted]

Sulayman Fu'ad: "Car Experts: Plants Producing Compact Cars Face 
Threat of Stoppage Because of Customs Tariff; Reduction of 
Customs Tariff on Production Requirements to Protect National 
Industry; Unidentified Cars Invade Egyptian Markets"] 
  [Text] Egyptian plants producing compact cars, which have 
an engine capacity of less than 1,300 cubic centimeters (cc), 
are threatened with stoppage and with the loss of the big 
investments spent to build these plants, not to mention the 
displacement of a large number of workers because of stoppage or 
of reduced production. The reason for this is the reduction of 
customs tariffs on all cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 
cc. This reduction has made these cars more salable than the car 
produced by Egyptian plants and has eliminated real competition 
between imports and local production because of the lower prices 
of imports. 
  We have in Egypt more than one plant that has begun to turn 
out production or is about to begin production, not to mention 
the al-Nasr Car Company production. 
  Car experts have demanded reduction of the customs tariff on 
the requirements needed to produce Egyptian cars of all 
capacities in order to protect this newborn industry from the 
ghoul of imports. The experts have also demanded that the car 
market be protected from numerous kinds of cars that are offered 
in the markets without any identification or country of origin 
and that carry international brand names. Officials must do this 
to safeguard Egypt's economy and its money. 
  Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Sa'udi, head of the car dealers branch of 
the Cairo Chamber of Commerce, has said reduced tariffs on 
imported cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has 
inflicted grave harm on domestic car plants at a time when these 
plants are making their first steps to meet the domestic demand 
for cars and to prepare to compete, even if at the price level 
only, with imported cars. 
  Dr. Sa'udi added that the government must not only consider 
securing cars for consumers at a price that is 5-percent or 
10-percent cheaper. It must, at the same time, consider the 
national industry's future and must promote domestic investments 
that open the door for greater employment opportunities and that 
create other subsidiary industries around them. 
  He urged reduction of the customs tariff on imported 
components so that plants can reduce their costs and can compete 
anew with imported cars. 
  Engineer Salah-al-Din al-Khudari, the commissioned member of 
the Suzuki Egypt Corporation, has noted that the recent customs 
tariff amendments have harmed domestic plants from two angles: 
customs fees on imported cars have dropped by 10 percent, thus 
improving their chance to compete and, on the other hand, the 
increase of 4 percent in service fees has led to increasing the 
customs fees on imported components, which means an increase in 
the cost of the domestic product! 
  Al-Khudari also said that a continuation of this condition 
will compel the Egyptian producer to depart the domestic car 
market and that the door will be opened wide for the foreign 
product to occupy this market. Al-Khudari further added that 
domestic plants have been forced to lower their prices in order 
to survive in the market even though this reduction saddles them 
with added burdens, keeping in mind the constant rise in the 
costs of electricity, power, water, insurance, and taxes. 
  Al-Khudari went on to add that the increased new car supply 
in the market and the drop in the prices of these cars, both 
domestic and imported, has led to an increased demand for them 
and, consequently, to a drop in the demand for used cars and in 
the prices of these cars. 
  He has urged that controls be established on car imports and 
that car dealership owners be given the necessary protection so 
that they can perform their role and secure post-sale service to 
the consumer. 
<H5>  Requirements for Compact-Car Production </H5>
  Husayn Abazah, deputy chairman of the Trade and Development 
Center, has said that reduced customs fees on compact cars will 
negatively affect the production of similar cars in Egypt. 
  Abazah has urged the government to reduce customs fees on 
requirements for the production of Egyptian compact cars so as 
to safeguard the investments that have been spent on this 
industry and to protect this industry's workers, especially 
since this newborn industry needs government protection. We have 
been urging full protection for more than a year, because aiding 
these plants by reducing the customs fees on the requirements 
for Egyptian compact-car production will enable local cars to 
compete with imported cars that have less than 1,300 cc engine 
capacity. Thus, we will preserve the investments that have been 
made in this field. 
  He stressed that Egyptian cars will find it very difficult 
to 
compete with imported cars with an engine capacity of less than 
1,300 cc, especially in light of reduced customs fees on the 
imports. Therefore, the customs tariff concerning production 
requirements for cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc must 
be reconsidered. 
  Abazah said that Egyptian-produced cars with an engine 
capacity of 1,500-2,000 cc will not be affected by the recently 
announced customs tariff reduction and that the volume produced 
in Egypt has not been able to meet the growing demand for cars 
with a 1,500-2,000 cc capacity. Moreover, the price of the 
import exceeds the price of the similar domestic product by 
nearly 30 percent. 
  Husayn Abazah pointed out, however, that the domestic market 
for big cars produced in Egypt would, by necessity, be affected 
by the customs tariff reduction if such cars were produced in 
large numbers. 
  He urged officials to protect the car market and the 
Egyptian 
consumer from the entry of unidentifiable cars now that the door 
of imports has been opened. He said, "We don't know in what 
country these cars are produced, even though they carry 
international brand names. This will undermine the national 
wealth, because hard currency will be spent on importing such 
cars. Moreover, the hypothetical life span of these vehicles is 
50 percent shorter than the life span of the genuine vehicle 
originating from the genuine source." 
  He stressed that the Egyptian consumer will suffer a big 
loss 
if he buys such vehicles. 
<H5>  Consumers Prefer Imports </H5>
  An official source of al-Nasr Car Company has said that 
reducing the customs fees by 10 percent will affect the Egyptian 
car market, especially the production plants, negatively. 
  He added that the consumer will buy imports instead of the 
locally-produced types. 
  This official asserted that [domestic] car companies have 
begun to reconsider some current proposals to produce new car 
models in anticipation of chaos in the Egyptian car market. 
<H5>  Car Plants Face Threat of Closure </H5>
  Majdi Mukhtar, the chairman of a new company operating in 
the 
field of passenger car production, has said that the 10-percent 
reduction in customs fees will inflict heavy losses on Egyptian 
car producers. 
  Mukhtar has proposed that the government provide a grace 
period of 4-5 years without any customs fee reduction in order 
to enable producers to increase the domestic component and 
reduce imported components used in car production. 
  Mukhtar also said, "On the other hand, the resource 
development fee can be raised by as much as the reduction in 
customs fees so as to make up for the customs fee reduction on 
the [imported] fully-manufactured commodity." 
  He said that he has invested an estimated 150 million pounds 
to build a new car factory, and that he will go ahead and 
produce the car, because complete stoppage means a big loss in 
the invested capital. 
  Mukhtar asserted that with the customs fee reduction, the 
fully-manufactured imported car will compete with the national 
production, thus exposing new investments to extreme risks that 
reach the extent of complete closure. 
  Faruq Ihsan, a car dealer, has said, "The used and new car 
markets are dominated by chaos and anticipation now that the 
customs tariff on cars with a capacity of less than 1,300 cc has 
been reduced. This condition will last for three months before 
the car market can regain its past condition. 
  "Used car prices will drop by no less than 20 percent now 
that new cars have no customs fees and that there has been a big 
increase in the used car supply." 
  Ihsan added, "Sales declined immediately after the tariff 
was 
announced, because buyers have stopped buying cars in the hope 
of getting the biggest reduction in car prices. They are 
entitled to do this because the price of a single car may drop 
by 7,000 pounds." 
  Ihsan further said, "Demand will be for new cars offered by 
dealers and companies on bank-guaranteed installments so as to 
take advantage of the 10-percent customs fee reduction. 
Moreover, all the buyer has to do is make a small down payment 
get a brand new car."

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Bahr al-'Alum, member of the Executive </F>
Committee of the Iraqi National Congress: "The Need for 
Deploying International Observers in Iraq"] 
  [Text] Engulfed in crisis, the Iraqi people found a unique 
champion in the person of Max van der Stoel, the UN Human Rights 
Commissioner in Iraq, who took its cause to the highest 
international forums and preached a message of conciliation 
among nations that was missing from the international arena 
since the dictatorship assumed power 25 years ago. 
  Since his first report three years ago, van der Stoel 
reiterates the same call month after month and the more he 
repeats it the wider and longer becomes the list of crimes 
against individuals and groups in Iraq and the more the Special 
Commissioner bumps against international unwillingness to 
challenge tyranny. This unwillingness is exhibited by the same 
countries that turned their backs on the Iraqi people during the 
popular uprising of 1991 and whose technological weapons broke 
the backs of our heroes in the Iraqi north and south. 
  Van der Stoel is a supporter of our great people, who will 
remember him and other friends of the Iraqi people like him for 
centuries to come for the positions they took. We need to 
implement his recommendations today for the sake of fairness in 
the world and justice in Iraq. 
  We have called repeatedly, and shall continue to do so, for 
a 
secure region in the whole of Iraq, or in any part of it that 
would allow freedom to grow, as it grows and prospers today in 
the north of Iraq thanks to the international protection it 
enjoys. 
  Today, we are called upon to support and implement the 
recommendations of the Special Commissioner. By calling for the 
deployment of international observers to safeguard human rights 
throughout Iraq, he is in effect calling for a secure zone that 
would encompass all Iraqi lands--a zone where human rights are 
inviolate and where the Iraqi people are not targeted for 
genocide. We realize that the power and determination to do so 
are lacking today, but we insist on that just demand, hoping 
that we will have an opportunity in the near future to prove to 
the world that human rights and freedom in Iraq are of the 
essence for the stability of the region, just as oppression over 
a quarter century was at the core of deterioration and wars in 
and out of Iraq. 
  We remain hopeful today for the establishment of such a 
secure zone and for deploying international observers in all of 
Iraq, in our bloodied south, in our burnt regions, and in our 
abused Baghdad. Today we call against standing hand-tied before 
the crisis and for being diligent in seeking some means to 
realize the people's aspirations for freedom and for crippling 
the hand of dictatorship and staying it from oppressing and 
terrorizing the Iraqis. 
  We have a request in this connection that only takes a 
political resolution by the United Nations: deploy international 
human rights observers throughout our liberated northern Iraq 
and give them the official task of recording the facts and 
investigating conditions in Iraq from within Iraq. 
  Such an assignment would derive its legality from 
authorizing 
the observers to guarantee that everyone respects human rights 
in our Iraqi north and guarantee respect for those human rights 
and the cessation of terrorist practices by the regime there. 
Other assignments for the observers would be to monitor and 
investigate instances of human rights violations by the regime 
in regions that still suffer under it, thereby fulfilling the 
commissioner's task; and to prepare for the direct coverage of 
human rights monitoring in the regions and towns that achieve 
liberation from dictatorship. 
  Such a direct implementation of the special commissioner's 
recommendations will not be sufficient and will not achieve its 
purpose for the time being, but it would represent a qualitative 
change that would put the regime on the defensive, for the first 
time since the Gulf war, about an operation linked to a 
fundamental issue that has to do with the people directly. That 
would restrain the regime's terrorism and atrocities and would 
lend efficacy to the pragmatic deployment of observers. It would 
be an accomplishment in that we would be relegating to the 
international community responsibility for the people's tragedy. 
  As we call for deploying international human rights 
observers 
in Iraq, we urge the leaders of the Arab and Muslim worlds and 
the UN secretary general to abandon their silence and stop 
ignoring our life and death issues. Are they going to let 
strangers to Arabdom and Islam, like van der Stoel, Emma 
Nicholson, and others, show more concern for and interest in our 
causes?

<F P=106> [Article by Ma'sum Sa'di] </F>
  [Text] It is a great step for us to teach a child how to 
read and understand the Holy Koran beginning in elementary 
school to implement what the president-commander stipulated when 
he said, "It is necessary to formulate a plan under which the 
student understands the Koran thoroughly upon completion of 
secondary school." 
  However, for many reasons, students, guardians, and teachers 
of the Koran have voiced many complaints regarding the plan's 
implementation. For this report, we went around to the concerned 
parties to become familiar with the causes of the problem and 
students' and officials' opinions, hardships, and 
recommendations for mounting a successful campaign of faith that 
achieves the desired objective. 
  The importance and results of teaching the Holy Koran to 
students are obvious. Such instruction provides students with 
spiritual values and concepts by which they can correct what is 
wrong. It also helps them develop good language skills. 
Elementary school students memorize a suitable number of verses 
at each level. This develops their language skills and enriches 
their vocabulary with terms that they will use year after year. 
  Students and guardians have problems with the difficult 
instruction and the method used to convey it. The curriculum 
includes many long chapters of the Koran and is thus very 
intensive and difficult for the child to absorb. For example, 
the first-grade curriculum, like that of other levels, includes 
two books. One is the Islamic Education Book. It 
includes five chapters of the Koran for memorization ("The 
Opening," "The Purity of Faith," "Mankind," "Help," and 
"Abundance"), several religious teachings (e.g., prayer, the 
principles of Islam, and love of God and his Prophet), and short 
prophetic traditions. The other book is the Holy Koran for 
reading with a commentary on "its readings and its meanings." It 
includes more than 30 chapters. Is this not too much for a child 
to learn to read and write word by word? 
  Most believe that the Islamic Education Book is 
very adequate for this level. This is what Majidah Hamid, a 
teacher, says. She goes on to say that the Koran is very 
intensive and too advanced for first-grade students, and that 
the Islamic Education Book by itself more than 
adequately fulfills the desired purpose. 
<H5>  Unsupportive Method </H5>
  The teaching method plays an important role and has a 
far-reaching effect on the psyche of the child and student. What 
is happening in our schools is that some teachers and 
instructors are not in harmony with the desired goal. Their 
method is unsupportive and tough rather than gentle to make the 
subject easy. This generates strong reactions. 
  One woman, Iman Jamil, relates her hardships as follows: My 
daughter, Halah, is in the third grade in elementary school. Her 
main problem concerns memorization of the Holy Koran. She weeps 
in fear of the teacher of this subject, who threatens to beat 
them and screams at them if one of them does not know how to 
read a word correctly or did not memorize a chapter well. 
  Halah's mother says that she does not know how to explain 
some of the meanings and verses about which Halah asks, which 
the mother finds to be beyond her daughter's age and educational 
level. Halah asks her about them continuously, because they are 
a part of the curriculum. For example, the chapter, "Women," 
deals with marriage and related matters, which are undoubtedly 
beyond the level of Halah, who is not yet 10. 
  An official source in the Education Ministry told us that 
the 
ministry has established a process in which parts of the Holy 
Koran are introduced at each academic level, from the first 
grade of elementary school through the sixth grade of middle 
school. He emphasized that the early levels start with short 
chapters. Also, the ministry has asked teachers not to require 
students to memorize chapters or verses of the Koran except for 
those specified in the instructions for each grade, aside from 
chapters and verses designated to be understood and explained 
generally. The ministry also prepared a manual called From 
the Rules of Recitation and distributed it to all teachers 
and schools in the country. The manual specifies the recitation 
rules, which must be learned in each grade. 
  Nonetheless, what is happening is raising questions! 
  Another important thing that we noted, about which many 
guardians complained to us, is the fact that teachers digress 
from the subject and speak of matters having no bearing on 
religion. The president-commander emphasized this point in a 
speech during a meeting with officials regarding elementary and 
secondary education. He said, "The Koran must be understood in a 
precise, integrated curriculum, without independent opinions and 
without development and expansion. We want to teach only the 
Koran." 
  Regarding this problem, let us present several illustrations 
of what some teachers have been doing in our schools. 
  Muhammad Talib is in the sixth grade of elementary school. 
He 
returned one day from school and removed all of the pictures 
hanging on the walls of his home, even those of his father and 
relatives. When his mother asked him why he did so, he told her 
that the teacher of the Holy Koran had told them that it is 
"forbidden" to hang pictures on the wall, because it violates 
religious teachings! 
  Wasan, a student in the third grade of middle school, is 
still a cause of dismay for her father. He has taken her from 
one physician to another because of her difficult psychological 
state, which induces a feeling of fear in her. She awakens at 
night from persistent nightmares and dreams of death, because 
the Holy Koran teacher speaks continuously and in detail of the 
nature of death, the size of the grave, the afterlife, how God 
will punish mankind, how the body disintegrates, and other 
details which have aroused fear and dread in the students' 
psyches. 
  There are many other examples and illustrations. Instruction 
in the Holy Koran has thus come to have side effects stemming 
from independent opinions and instructional [methods], which 
most students find difficult to endure. As a result, most 
families with children in school are experiencing difficulties. 
<H5>  Courses for Teachers Are Brief and Fast </H5>
  In most cases, we find that the teacher is either strict or 
incompetent. In either case, the desired goal is not achieved, 
because the Koran is learned in a difficult manner. One factor 
contributing to this outcome is the failure, despite the 
importance of this subject, to select teachers who can teach the 
Koran effectively based on principles and methods that 
facilitate the explaining and understanding of this subject. 
  At present, teachers are not well prepared relative to the 
importance of the campaign. The Education Ministry has held 
training courses, but they have been brief and fast. 
  The teacher Iman 'Adnan: How can we convey an intensive 
curriculum in a simplified, understandable manner if it causes 
us hardship, and we find it difficult at times to absorb it? The 
Koran comprises foundations and principles, and the courses in 
which they enrolled us were very brief, lasting not more than a 
month. These courses covered 11 subjects, only four of which 
pertained to the subject. I do not know how "reasoning by 
analogy and adaptation" and other lessons from which we neither 
derived nor understood anything are related to teaching the Holy 
Koran. This is a faith campaign. One would assume that it would 
be of adequate utility and not so abbreviated. What happened is 
that we were dismayed by an intensive, lengthy curriculum, which 
we were required to convey in a simplified manner to students 
who are still in the early stages of their education! 
<H5>  What the Concerned Parties Say </H5>
  Our first thought was that the Awqaf and Religious Affairs 
Ministry--because it specializes in the principles and teachings 
of the Koran and all that pertains to it--would have a role in 
the faith campaign in the schools, whether by giving its opinion 
and advice or by helping to formulate the academic curriculum 
and select the teachers. This is certainly not to say that the 
Education Ministry lacks competence in this area. However, a 
specialist undoubtedly knows the subject of his specialty better 
than others. Accordingly, we went to the Awqaf and Religious 
Affairs Ministry, only to be surprised to learn that the 
ministry has had no involvement whatsoever in the matter, 
although it has expressed its willingness to help and is still 
willing to provide advice or help if asked to do so. The 
important thing is to achieve a positive outcome and a 
successful campaign. 
  To become familiar with the opinions and observations of 
specialists in the principles and teaching of the Holy Koran, we 
met with Dr. Muhyi Hilal al-Sirhan, the dean of the College of 
Islamic Sciences at Baghdad University. He spoke with us about 
teaching the Holy Koran and memorization of it to elementary 
school students. He said: The Koran is a rich source of 
vocabulary words, a sea of meanings and terms, and an 
inexhaustible treasure of meritorious morals and comely 
characteristics. It is worthwhile for us to explain to our 
elementary students an appropriate measure of the word of 
almighty God, which is the best word, and to have them memorize 
short chapters and then progressively longer chapters of the 
Koran. As to the memorization method at the early elementary 
level, the instructor should first use the conventional 
memorization techniques used in the schools. When the students 
become skillful in this initial phase and can memorize, they can 
then be assigned to memorize texts as homework. The memorization 
of texts in the school is carried out in steps. After the 
meanings and commandments of texts have been taught, and the 
students have become proficient in reading them aloud 
individually and collectively applying the rules and principles 
of Koranic recitation, written verses are then presented to the 
students on a blackboard, signboard, television screen, or card. 
After the students can consistently read the verses well, the 
teacher begins to gradually cover up words, first one word, then 
two, then three, and so on until an entire passage is covered. 
In this way, an entire chapter can be memorized, paying heed to 
the correct pronunciation "rules of Koranic recitation" and 
their practical application. 
  Shaykh Dr. 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Sa'di, the chairman of the 
Islamic Literature Association and a professor at the Institute 
of Imams and Preachers, finds that the teaching of the Holy 
Koran in a sound manner enables the student to master the words 
of the Holy Koran. He believes that we should follow the method 
used in the traditional Kuttab [the lowest elementary level in 
the Koran schools], which focuses on memorization of the Holy 
Koran. This method consists of teaching children at the early 
elementary level the Arabic consonants and vowels and how they 
are connected. This is called spelling. Then the student is able 
to read any word in the Holy Koran. This method has its 
principles and rules. Academic research done in this area can be 
circulated to the teachers of the Holy Koran, who can be 
enrolled in courses for this purpose. Shaykh 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Sa'di continues: Perhaps it is said that this method is 
antiquated and not accepted by modern pedagogy. However, 
experimentation has proved that it is the only method for 
mastering the words of the Holy Koran. 
  Psychologically, the students' desire to recite the Holy 
Koran can be awakened by making it attractive and by easing the 
difficulties of which they complain. The class can be divided 
into groups that compete for a prize. Also, young students can 
be taught the purpose of reading the Koran by explaining to them 
God's reward in the afterlife and the benefit that the student 
will enjoy in his temporal life. The current curriculum being 
taught at the elementary and higher levels requires some 
revisions, namely the selection of short chapters for the lower 
levels, longer ones for the middle, and lengthy ones for the 
final levels. 
<H5>  Ideas and Recommendations </H5>
  After we obtained these opinions and heard the hardships of 
students, their guardians, and concerned persons, the goal of 
all of us is still a successful faith campaign. The following 
are some recommendations for review and possibly use by 
officials and persons concerned with this subject: 

  -  The teachers now responsible for teaching Koranic 
recitation are not experts in this area. This subject should be 
taught by specialists who have extensive experience in this 
field. The imams of mosques spread throughout the country can be 
used for this purpose, if only for a transitional period, until 
a complete Koranic cadre is trained. We also call for developing 
current teachers of the Holy Koran by enrolling them in long 
courses in the method for teaching and simplifying the subject. 
  -  Reduction of the curriculum at the elementary levels: How 
nice 
it would be to limit the curriculum to the "Islamic Education 
Book in the first, second, and third grades inasmuch as it 
accomplishes the desired goal. 
  -  We also call upon teachers of the subject to be patient and 
gentle, tolerate their students' mistakes, and descend to the 
level of their intellect and comprehension without violence, 
beating, or threats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Baghdad Mayor Tahir Muhammad Hassun, by </F>
Hamid 'Abdallah; place and date not given: "Baghdad Mayor Wants 
Trustworthy City Administration"--first three paragraphs are 
ALIF BA' introduction] 
  [Text] Many questions crowded into my mind, each of them 
wanting priority over the others and each of them seeking a 
clear answer. Where shall I begin with Mr. Tahir Muhammad 
Hassun, the mayor of Baghdad? How much time do I need to satisfy 
my curiosity and come out with the result I desire? 
  The man gave me no opportunity to arrange my questions, for 
he spoke first, as if he had read my mind. He asked and 
answered, inquired and explained. My journalistic duty forces me 
to say that I heard not one word of justification from him. He 
did not take the role of defense attorney for his institution, 
as many do. Instead, I found him taking the side of the citizen 
against the apparatus of his department, many of whose practices 
he criticized. 
  He did not mince his words. He said there are negative 
phenomena that must be uprooted, corrupt elements of which the 
city administration must be cleansed. In this area there is 
dilatoriness; in that area there is negligence. Thus it was an 
interview more characterized by agreement than by disagreement 
and argument. 
<H5>  Corrupt Officials, Out-of-Control Citizens </H5>
  ['Abdallah] What is the first priority on your agenda? 
  [Hassun] Many tasks are competing for priority and 
precedence. I can list them as follows: Baghdad's cleanliness, 
maintaining the sewage system, repairing cave-ins, and keeping 
the drinking water network at the required purity. 
  ['Abdallah] Have you given each of these its share of 
attention? 
  [Hassun] Our basic problem lies in our insufficient 
technical 
and human resources due to conditions of the embargo. The 
resources of a single municipal unit of metropolitan Baghdad in 
terms of engineering and mechanical effort used to equal the 
resources of the municipality as a whole after the embargo. 
Nevertheless, this situation does not warrant weak performance 
in any section. We must not make the embargo a peg on which to 
hang the persistence of the negative phenomena and conditions 
that emerge in various places. We must uproot and eradicate them 
whatever the circumstances. Accordingly, we must be on the scene 
to observe, monitor, and diagnose the places where defect hides. 
We must examine the efficiency of performance. Through intensive 
presence on the scene, we have discovered many negative 
phenomena and have rung the bell to announce that there are 
defects in two basic elements: the corrupt official and the 
out-of-control citizen. 
  ['Abdallah] However, the directives and laws of the mayor's 
office have contributed to creating corrupt officials by giving 
lower-level staffs powers that enable them to treat people 
arbitrarily. 
  [Hassun] That is true. We have dealt seriously with the 
matter by restricting penal powers to high-level 
staffs--specifically, in the field monitoring apparatus, the 
unit directors, and general directors. We noticed that the 
lower-level staffs that had power and authority to fine and 
punish had begun to collude shamefully with violators. A minor 
city official could be bought for a paltry price. With the taste 
of his free lunch still in his mouth, he would become a defender 
of the restaurant owner who threw trash into the middle of the 
street. He would also be accustomed to taking his cut from 
storekeepers--each in his specialty. An official could get his 
food free from a restaurant owner, have his hair cut without fee 
by the barber, have his car repaired without cost at the 
mechanic's, and take regular protection money from wrongdoers, 
turning a blind eye to their misdeeds in return. He would see 
people throw trash and oil into the sewer lines or leave it 
wherever they wanted, and would turn his eyes--and the city be 
damned! I say this in sadness and bitterness, after having 
uncovered many such elements and having been forced to dismiss 
them and cleanse the city bureaucracy of them. If you ask me 
what the duty of the lower-level staffs should be, I say that 
their real duty is to monitor the movement of garbage trucks. 
This is their duty according to the ordinance of the city of 
Baghdad. Anyone who likes this duty is welcome; anyone who 
doesn't--goodbye to him! 
  ['Abdallah] This means that the number of inspectors has 
become restricted to the number of unit and general directors. 
Do you think this number issufficient to monitor the streets of 
Baghdad, as extensive as they are? 
  [Hassun] Our mission is not to give punishments and fines to 
citizens. Our goal is to establish behavior and models that 
citizens respect, rather than what a city official wants. What 
harm would there be if the administration's upper staff, 
starting with the mayor and ending with the unit directors, 
turned into inspectors, if that protected citizens from the 
blackmail of the weak-spirited and realized the noble end we all 
seek--the cleanliness of our beloved Baghdad? I am sure that if 
citizens see real, just, and serious oversight, they will be 
eager to obey the municipal laws. Thus we shall achieve the 
desired goal of municipal discipline. 
<H5>  Major Blight </H5>
  ['Abdallah] This concerns the commercial and tourist 
districts. What about the residential districts? Garbage has 
begun to accumulate in some of them until there are tall piles 
of trash, as well as overflowing and clogged sewers. 
  [Hassun] I agree with you that our service efforts in the 
residential districts are not at the desired level. This is 
because our attention now is focused on the tourist and 
commercial districts. If the service units we have established 
in the commercial and tourist streets bear fruit, and if the 
sanitation contractors can carry out their duties successfully 
and trustworthily despite our observations against them, we 
shall be able to move a large part of our service effort to the 
residential districts. We hope to do this shortly. 
  ['Abdallah] While we are on the subject of sanitation 
contractors, are you satisfied with their work? Didn't the city 
administration cancel its contracts with them not too long ago, 
and then contract with them again? What was the reason? 
  [Hassun] Necessities required that we again enter into 
contracts with the contractors. In the past, some of them were 
selected on dishonest principles. But I am for encouraging and 
supporting the experiment if correct, sound, and honest formulas 
are found. I think that large sanitation companies must be 
created, as are found in many countries. Although we have 
recorded our observations against some of them, we are not 
hesitating to support by various formulas and means those that 
are dedicated. 
  ['Abdallah] You announced that all the pumps draining the 
water of the sewers would be repaired. Yet despite the shortage 
of water in the current winter season, many of Baghdad's streets 
have been flooded. What was the cause? 
  [Hassun] There are 259 main water drainage stations in 
Baghdad, with 910 vertical and submerged pumps. There are 6,000 
km of rain, sewage, and shared pipes, in addition to 600,000 
rain water grills scattered throughout the city of Baghdad. You 
can imagine the effort required to maintain and repair this 
complicated large network that has not been given any real 
maintenance since it was built until the time of the broad 
campaign we have undertaken for this purpose. 
  The overflows that flooded the streets had many causes. For 
one thing, rain water grills became blocked because trash had 
accumulated in them and because grease had been discarded. There 
were also the cave-ins that the sewer network has 
suffered--between 25 and 30 every month, some medium-sized, some 
big, with depths from 1 to 9 meters. Add to this the 
obsolescence of the sewer network and the effect of the 
30-nation aggression, which was accompanied by a complete 
stoppage of the drainage pumps. This led to a rise in the level 
of stagnant water and its not being drained. The result was 
instability of the ground, not to mention the obvious effect in 
this regard of the flood season that the country experienced in 
1988. However, I concentrate here on an essential cause--what I 
would call the "killer cause"--misuse of the drainage networks 
by citizens. 
  Surely you have heard about the blockage of the sewers in 
Saddam City. We made a field investigation of the state of the 
sewer system there and found--marvel of marvels!--we discovered 
that all the waste and residue that the industrial district in 
Kisrah and 'Atash produces are thrown into the sewers--grease, 
automobile parts, tires, and animals. What network is there that 
could swallow all these objects? What pumps could get rid of 
them? We diagnosed three main sources of damage to the sewage 
system in Saddam City: street vendors, the industrial district 
in Kisrah and 'Atash, and the popular markets. 
  We have formulated a plan to clean up and maintain the sewer 
system in Saddam City in coordination with the General 
Federation of Labor Unions. Shop owners in Kisrah and 'Atash 
will bear part of the cost of maintaining and cleaning up the 
sewers. We have collected 3 million dinars for this purpose. As 
a first step, we have built 13 regular lots for street vendors 
in the whole of Baghdad. We have taken the initiative to fence 
and pave the popular markets. We have set a time limit for 
completing this task not to exceed three months. 
<H5>  Flight From "Repellent Occupation" </H5>
  ['Abdallah] One notices that many residential-district open 
spaces designated as parks have become areas to collect garbage. 
Aren't the units of the Baghdad municipal administration 
concerned about these areas? 
  [Hassun] The natural place for these wastes is the 
sanitation 
burial area 50 km from the center of the city of Baghdad. But 
because of a shortage of vehicles to transport waste, we have 
been forced to create temporary trash collection areas. The 
trash will be transported later to the sanitation burial area. 
Therefore, the areas to which you referred have to be cleaned 
up, and their trash must be taken to the temporary collection 
areas. The reason for its accumulation has to do with the lack 
of resources in city administration units, as I mentioned to you 
at the beginning of the interview. 
  ['Abdallah] Haven't you found a means to deal with the 
phenomenon of citizens' aversion to taking jobs and positions 
with the Baghdad city administration? 
  [Hassun] The essential reason for aversion to working in 
some 
city occupations is social attitude, which cannot be remedied by 
administrative decree. Nevertheless, in order to create 
incentives sufficient to overcome this phenomenon, we have 
established a system of incentives and productivity criteria. We 
have granted the general directors full powers for this purpose. 
However, city occupations remain "repellent occupations," rather 
than "attractive" ones. 
  ['Abdallah] What was the first negative phenomenon you 
remedied after you assumed responsibility for Baghdad's city 
administration? 
  [Hassun] The first slogan I raised was: "War on lying." No 
one shall make me hear the words "Yes, sir!" without their being 
accompanied by honest and exact implementation. I have continued 
to make war on liars and dishonest people. My ultimate goal is 
to cleanse the city administration of corrupt people and reward 
and support those who are sincere and honest. 
  ['Abdallah] We said goodbye to the mayor of Baghdad, having 
taken from his office an important fact--that the mayor has 
assumed a heavy legacy of bureaucracy, job corruption, and 
administrative idling. As a result, bad money in the Baghdad 
administrative has driven out the good. This equation he is 
determined to reverse. May none but the trustworthy remain 
trustees!

<F P=106> [Article by Professor A. Har'el Fish: "Eretz Yisra'el and </F>
the Question of Preserving Life"] 
  [Text] The religious community in all its diversity is 
split on the issue of its duty regarding Eretz Yisra'el in these 
days of historical decisions on which depend the future of the 
people and the state. In truth, the disagreement on this subject 
is not between the parties: the NRP [National Religious Party], 
Shas [Torrah Observing Sephardim], Degel Hatora, and Agudat 
Yisra'el, rather it is more correct to say that it exists within 
each of these parties. In each of them, there are at least two 
schools of thought that are opposed on this subject. Often, the 
split passes even within the religious family unit, when the son 
(or the father) believes that peace as a high Jewish value is 
preferred over all else, and that this is what is on the agenda, 
and the father (or the son) is convinced with all his heart and 
his soul that there is no holier duty today than the duty to 
ensure the territorial integrity of the country as it is now 
held by us. Such a disagreement on principles is, perhaps, 
legitimate. 
  Everyone can bring evidence from our forefathers to 
strengthen his position, and the things are known. At the time 
of one crisis, it was said of Abraham "and he mustered his 
retainers" and then he smote the four kings; and on another 
occasion he made an alliance with Avimelekh, King of the 
Philistines, over the division of the country; Jacob, our 
father, struggled all night with Esau's man and overcame him, 
but in other circumstances castigated Shim'on and Levy for the 
deed against Shechem. I do not seek first of all to establish 
which way suits the situation to which we are now subject, even 
though I have a clear opinion on the subject. I seek to argue 
against posing the question as an ordinary Halakhic question of 
what is permissible and what is forbidden, which can be resolved 
with the customary tools. 
  In fact, both of the schools of thought rely on Halakhic 
arguments. The "hawkish" school of thought links the question 
with a positive commandment (according to the Ramban's system) 
"to inherit the land" and with the injunction against 
transferring ownership over the land of Yisra'el to foreigners. 
And the conclusion is that one must not relinquish portions of 
Eretz Yisra'el that returned to us in one way or another, and on 
the basis of these commandments, the State of Israel must 
continue to maintain its rule over all areas of the country that 
were conquered miraculously in the Six-Day War. The "dovish" 
school of thought does not deny the validity of the two 
aforementioned commandments, but the rabbis of this school do 
not view themselves as authorized to conclude from them a clear 
military or political conclusion, on account of the calculation 
of "the sanctity of life," which, as is known, supersedes all 
the commandments of the Torah except regarding the shedding of 
blood, incest, and idolatry, about which we were warned, "be 
killed and do not transgress." As for the transfer of the 
ownership over areas of Eretz-Yisra'el to foreigners the rule of 
the sanctity of life applies, that is, "transgress and do not be 
killed." Moreover, if the subject is "the sanctity of life of 
the community," that is, a danger to the entire people or a 
large part of it due to the observance of the commandment, then 
of course the Torah does not require of us such a price to hold 
on to all of Eretz-Yisra'el and to prevent the transfer of this 
or that area to foreign owners. 
  According to this school of thought, only one question 
remains: who will determine whether in our situation today there 
is a fear for "the sanctity of life of the community" that must 
bring us to a withdrawal? And the answer is that on this the 
various experts will decide, experts on politics and experts in 
military matters, and according to the teaching that they tell 
us, we will act. If they decide to relinquish, we will 
relinquish, and if they decide to stand firm, we shall stand. To 
what is this similar? To a sick person for whom the Shabbat must 
be desecrated. The doctor determines whether the law of "the 
sanctity of life" applies to his illness or not. Military men 
and politicians are, as it were, the doctors of our situation. 
<H5>  Between a Verdict and a Torah Opinion </H5>
  I present these views in general terms as they have been 
understood among the broad religious public and without going 
into all of the Halakhic details (and without going into the 
difference between "a verdict" and "a Torah opinion," which, of 
course, is important), and my question is: what is the nature of 
this disagreement? From the Torah-religious viewpoint, has the 
question been posed properly? Do the rules of this legal debate 
indeed apply to the problem at hand? 
  First, let us ask the "hawkish" school of thought. Is there 
really a complete correspondence between the subject of the sale 
of lands and the transfer of the ownership over them to 
foreigners, which is a simple, ordinary question, and the 
defense or the relinquishing of areas of the homeland, which is 
an existential-national question? It seems that in the time of 
monarchy in Israel such fateful questions were handed over to 
the decision of the king, who was to consult about it with the 
High Priest and with the Sanhedrin according to the "decision of 
the Urim" (see Numbers 27:21, and see Tractate 
Yoma, page 73). And such matters do not belong to the 
regular Halakhic level, but are instead much more serious. If 
the Sanhedrin decides on war, it decides on life and death, on 
existence, and its decision is definitely liable to result in a 
heavy price in human life. And if the Sanhedrin decides in the 
decision of the Urim on "withdrawal" at a certain moment of 
danger, it does not appear that such a decision transgresses the 
ordinary injunction against selling lands and transferring the 
ownership to foreigners. 
  In short, there are two levels here, one 
governmental-existential, and the other legal-Halakhic, and an 
emphasis on the legal-Halakhic aspect weakens the arguments of 
the "hawkish" school of thought in the eyes of many, both 
religious and secular, who do not regard our big political 
question today as an affair that belongs to the ordinary sphere 
of what is allowed and what is forbidden, regarding which one 
may ask a learned question and act according to the Halakha laid 
down in the Shulkhan Arukh or in the "Yad Hahazaka." 
  Here, as was said, is the weak side of the "hawkish" school, 
but the great advantage of the members of this school of thought 
is that they view the question of Eretz Yisra'el and its 
protection as mainly a religious question. A question 
that must not be removed from the realm of faith and abandoned 
to ordinary politicians, and ordinary military men. Even though 
we said that questions of this kind belong to a level called 
"the decision of the Urim," that, too, is an institution among 
the institutions of the Torah and belief, where the calculations 
are not solely political. While this institution does not exist 
in our time, this does not mean that the approach is invalid, 
that the principle of "the decision of the Urim" is invalid for 
the Jew who believes in the Torah and the Prophets. This Jew 
feels in the nature of things that his faith obligates him 
precisely on the fateful questions of today, and that the trust 
in Hashem [God], who is the savior and redeemer of Israel, is a 
foundation that must be reflected in practical decisions and in 
political and military moods. And here is expressed not only a 
legitimate religious calculation, but even the main points of 
his belief. 
  The "dovish" side in the disagreement starts, as it were, 
with the assumption that here there is no ordinary Halakhic 
problem, and as it is connected with political-military 
calculations, it hands over the operational responsibility to 
"experts" in this matter. But, in fact, the Halakhic calculation 
is narrower for them than it is for the "hawks." For them, the 
whole matter is reduced to the question of "the sanctity of 
life," that is, the legal permission that is given to violate 
injunctions for the sake of saving lives. And it may be asked: 
does the Halakhic mechanism of "the sanctity of life" apply to 
the question at hand? Is the question whether to withdraw from 
Jerusalem and the cities of Judaea really on the same plane as 
the question whether to violate or not to violate the Shabbat 
for a seriously ill person?! Should not the question of "the 
sanctity of life" have been kept in mind by, for example, the 
rebels of the Warsaw Ghetto when they decided what they decided, 
or by the defenders of Kfar 'Etzyon during the War of 
Liberation? If we pose the problems in that manner, we will 
arrive at absurdities. Perhaps it would turn out that Mattityahu 
and his sons should not have risen up against the Greeks, and 
that during the siege of Jerusalem in the time of Hizkiyahu, the 
King, they should have surrendered to Sennacherib and not 
endangered the life of the nation by a stubborn stand for their 
independence! It is clear that here we have again arrived at the 
sphere called "the decision of the Urim," or, more correctly, 
the commandment to martyrdom, where the mechanism of "the 
sanctity of life" does not apply in its ordinary form. 
<H5>  The Sanctity of Life and the Sanctity of the Life of the </H5>
Nation 
  There is no doubt that this aspect of the problem was not 
obscured to the rabbis, including the luminaries of the 
generation who studied it and determined here the foundation of 
"the sanctity of life of the nation." They know well that on 
fateful questions the Jewish people always puts its life at 
stake "for our people and for the cities of our Lord," and that 
the path of redemption is also the dangerous path. If that is 
the case, why are they not ready to relate to the question of 
Eretz Yisra'el and its borders today as such a question, a 
question of faith, that is, a religious-creedal challenge of the 
highest order? And why do they not come out with the traditional 
call: "Be strong and let us get stronger for our people and for 
the cities of our Lord"? Their answer will surely be that the 
whole matter of "the decision of the Urim" is simply not 
customary today, as it depends upon institutions such as the 
Temple, the Sanhedrin, and the High Priests, that do not now 
exist. And for that reason, the religious leadership has no 
status in decisions in the political sphere. 
  Such an answer, as I have formulated it, seems logical. It 
is 
correct that we do not have a Sanhedrin and there is also no 
chance that this institution will soon reappear. But the answer 
is nevertheless evasive, and cannot satisfy the believing public 
that lives the events of today. We must first of all ask, who 
are "the diplomatic and military experts" who are to be relied 
upon in the present crisis? One division of statesmen and 
military men will tell us that the great danger to our existence 
will come if we do not withdraw from Jerusalem and from Judaea 
and Samaria. A different division of military men and statesmen, 
no less honorable and impressive, will tell us that the danger 
of extinction lies in wait for us precisely if we give in to the 
pressures and withdraw from the territories. So, who are the 
right experts whose opinion we are to accept? If we examine the 
qualifications of the various "experts," we shall see that there 
is not and it is not possible for there to be a scientific and 
objective approach such as in the case of the doctor and the 
sick person. Everyone brings to the question under discussion 
his ideological baggage. The men of the left determine their 
position according to their outlook, which--if we formulate it 
briefly--is peace and brotherhood with the Arabs as a supreme 
goal. The men of the right determine their position according to 
their ideological position, which gives preference to national 
honor and independence. The chasm yawns on either side of the 
thin rope upon which we tread. One tells us to step in this 
direction, and one tells us to step in that direction--each one 
according to his ideological considerations. Because the 
situation is exactly a situation of astonishing uncertainty 
regarding the results of either step, but, nevertheless, we are 
not exempt from the obligation to decide. 
  Is it precisely in this situation that the voice of the 
basic 
Jewish faith will be silenced? Must the great ones of the Torah 
close their eyes in this situation and pass the decision to the 
would-be "experts", that is, to the men of the secular 
parties---who, in the final analysis, will make a determination 
according to their ideological considerations? Will only the 
place of the faithful Jews be empty when these great questions 
are decided? I would be surprised! 
  The transfer of the decision to experts also means ignoring 
the way that decisions are made in a democratic society. Here 
there is no king or ruler that is all-powerful. The citizen must 
participate in the decision. He bears responsibility for the 
future of the nation--a responsibility that he cannot shift to 
experts. Or, if you will, we are all "experts." What is under 
discussion is an international and military situation whose main 
components are known to all of us. We all feel the dangers, and 
we shall all pay the price of mistaken judgements. And, if we 
speak in more concrete terms, some of the religious parties that 
are sitting today in the Knesset are known to have tremendous, 
and even decisive, influence over the course of diplomatic 
affairs. I refer mainly to Shas, but also to Agudat Yisra'el. 
Even though they are not for the moment sitting in the 
government, it is clear to everyone that in the given 
parliamentary situation, the coalition is not capable of 
functioning and implementing its withdrawal plan without the 
support (or, at least, their nonopposition) of the many members 
of Knesset from these parties. This means that they and their 
leaders have an unprecedented responsibility for the fate of the 
people and of the state. 
<H5>  To Fulfill the Religious-Jewish Faith </H5>
  Can it be that in such a situation they will shift their 
responsibility over to "experts"? What is this like? It is like 
the question whether to accept or not to accept the opinion of 
the 10 spies who asserted that it was not possible to conquer 
the country and to hold it. These were without a doubt the first 
"experts" of that generation. Not only that as a matter of 
course they were chosen for their public qualifications and 
their defense knowledge, but their status as experts was 
strengthened after they had travelled through the land and 
examined it thoroughly for forty days! There is also no doubt 
that the data that they gave on the security-military situation, 
about the difficulties, and about the character of the natives, 
had a foundation. It was only that their conclusions were 
mistaken due to a lack of faith and trust in Hashem. As 
Yehoshu'a Bin Nun and Caleb Ben Yefune asserted afterwards. 
Yehoshu'a and Caleb did not deny the data that their colleagues 
had provided. They rejected only their conclusions, and insisted 
that the decision making had to take into account also the 
factor of trust in Hashem and of fear of Hashem: "If Hashem 
wants us and he will bring us to this country and will give it 
to us!" 
  It is clear that we must today, as believing Jews, be guided 
by our ideological considerations, and among these the great 
principle of "Hashem is with us, do not be afraid." If all the 
men of the secular parties bring their ideological baggage, we 
can take into account the foundations of the Torah and the 
faith, and it is even our duty to do that. Because it was for 
that that the representatives of the religious parties were 
elected by their voters. Their representatives were not elected 
in order to decide according to the weltanschauung of Karl Marx, 
and not even according to the position of Ze'ev Jabotinsky. 
Rather it is their duty to fulfill their religious-Jewish belief 
in the everyday life of the state, including the great questions 
of foreign affairs and defense, and, perhaps, first and foremost 
regarding those questions. Because among them, "security" can 
never be just security, rather security with a double meaning. 
  And if nevertheless the esteemed rabbis who stand at the 
head 
of these parties prefer to evade their responsibility and to 
hand it over to others--that is, to "defense experts"--there 
will be no avoiding the conclusion that they are not ready to 
ascribe a religious significance to the great redemptions of our 
times, including the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War. They 
are not ready to see in these events "a way to pass to 
redemption," something that requires us to take a stand on the 
diplomatic questions. This approach is reminiscent of the 
approach of some of the Torah greats in Eastern Europe at the 
beginning of Zionism, who were not willing to view the Zionist 
Movement and the beginning of the renaissance in Eretz Yisra'el 
as "a way to pass to redemption." And for that reason, they 
actually abandoned the whole matter of the return to Zion to the 
hands of the secular camp. This comparison is depressing and 
unfortunate. In retrospect, it may be determined today that the 
reservation of the chiefs of "Agudat Yisra'el" from the year of 
5672 [1912] until World War II did not exactly bring a 
blessing to the people of Israel. And, therefore, it is to be 
hoped that in the end, Shas will not repeat the same tragic 
mistake of the early days of Zionism. 
  If we have learned to hear the voice of the Lord of Israel 
speaking to us from the tempest of history, let us not today 
seal our ears and behave as if there is no religious 
significance to the great events of our times, including the 
ingathering of the exiles in tremendous proportions, and 
including our return to Jerusalem, to the cities of Judaea, to 
the Temple Mount, and to the Western Wall. Here there is no fata 
morgana, rather a revolution in the life of our people. Our eyes 
see voices, and our eyes see the pillar of fire that lights up 
the night for us. If we do not respond as a religious public to 
this great challenge, it is as if we were agreeing with the 
haters of Israel who assert that the Torah and its scholars 
belong to the past, and that we do not have a part in the future 
of the nation. And to such a version, the vast majority of the 
religious public will not lend its hand.

<F P=106> [Article by Ra'uf Qubaysi and Suzannah Tarbush: "We Seek To </F>
Bolster Our Trade Relations With Britain, To Build Modern State, 
and To Lay Down Bases of Democracy"] 
  [Text] Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, Syria's minister of economy 
and foreign trade, has asserted that Syria is keen on bolstering 
its trade relations with Britain. He said that his country 
"seeks to build a modern state, to achieve development, and to 
lay down the bases of democracy." 
  The Syrian minister made the statements yesterday at a 
symposium that followed the inauguration of a Syrian products 
fair, entitled "Made in Syria" and sponsored by the Arab-British 
Chamber of Commerce in London. The fair will continue until 6 
May 1994. 
  The Syrian minister touched on his country's economic 
policy, 
saying that Syria is working to achieve economic independence 
and to take advantage of advanced knowledge in the science and 
technology area "while it bolsters the Arab economic cooperation 
procession." He added that the backbone of Syria's 
socio-economic and political system is an economic plurality 
that "guarantees every individual's economic freedom." He 
pointed out that economically this means the "presence of a 
public sector along with a private sector and a joint sector." 
  Al-'Imadi said that one of the important distinguishing 
marks 
in the Syrian economic procession is the process of gradual 
opening up to the market economy "in which the public sector 
coexists with a competing private sector." He pointed out that 
Syria launched this process by educating the people and 
preparing them to accept these principles "so the experiment 
will proceed in a fashion that spares the country social and 
political obstacles." He also said that Syria has managed, 
despite the recent difficult years, to raise its gross national 
product (from 83 billion Syrian pounds to 410 billion pounds in 
1993). 
  On inflation, al-'Imadi said that it was reduced from 26.3 
percent in 1985 to 5.7 percent in 1993 "when capital components 
rose from 20 billion pounds in 1985 to 100 billion pounds in 
1993, and when the exports and imports volume rose from 33.8 
billion pounds in 1987 to 60.7 billion pounds in 1993." 
  Minister al-'Imadi also touched on political relations 
between his country and Britain, saying that they are good and 
that mutual visits between Syrian and British ministers "have 
laid down the foundations of mutual understanding between the 
two countries on problems facing the Arab region and the world." 
  He added, "I still recall Mrs. Margaret Thatcher's visit to 
Syria when she was the shadow cabinet prime minister. Our 
president welcomed her and introduced her to his family 
members." Al-'Imadi further added, "I also still recall the 
post-World War II period when British forces ousted Vichy's 
military regime from Syria when Syria's wheat was the source of 
the bread that fed Allied troops in our region." 
  He also said that the accord, which he had the honor to sign 
in Damascus in 1976 with Michael Mitcher, the then deputy 
minister for parliamentary affairs [name and title as published] 
"is still the basis on which relations between our two countries 
are founded." 
  Al-'Imadi noted that the said accord called for bolstering 
economic relations and industrial exchange in the service of 
both sides. The accord further called for establishing a 
British-Syrian Council to achieve various objectives, including 
determination of the areas from which both sides can benefit and 
examination of the means that ensure the implementation of 
development projects. 
  He said that the aforementioned council met in April 1980 
and 
underlined the importance of increasing trade between Britain 
and Syria and of visits by businessmen's delegations, as well as 
the benefit of participation in trade fairs, particularly 
specialized fairs. 
  Minister al-'Imadi welcomed foreign investments in his 
country, saying, "Syria enjoys numerous advantages, including 
geographic position; a balanced industrial base that includes 
agriculture, oil and gas, industry, tourism, and commerce; a 
significant market of 13 million people; trade ties between 
Syria and the Arab countries; tax exemptions offered by Syria's 
investment laws; the stability Syria has achieved in the past 
one-quarter century; the availability of labor and skilled 
manpower; the presence of large groups of energetic businessmen; 
and people's openness and their ability to cooperate with 
others." 
  The "Made in Syria" fair is the first Syrian products fair 
organized outside the Arab world. A total of 160 Syrian 
companies have participated in it. The fair opening was attended 
by hundreds of Arab and foreign businessmen, plus Arab 
ambassadors and officials and a Syrian delegation comprised of 
10 individuals representing Syria's various ministries. 
Displayed products range from food products to traditional and 
modern products and textiles, machines, and other products. 
  At the symposium, held at the Hilton Hotel, Sir Richard 
Beaumont, the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce chairman, said in 
the address with which he opened the symposium that the fair 
idea "was welcomed by our Syrian friends." 
  The discussion touched on Syria and focused on its political 
importance in the Middle East. It also highlighted Syria's trade 
importance in history "when it was a sea region [engaged] in the 
silk and frankincense trade." 
  On the sidelines of the symposium, AL-HAYAH interviewed 
Muhammad Khadr, Syria's ambassador to Britain, who said that now 
that British-Syrian relations have improved, "especially since 
British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd's visit to Syria," the 
idea of the fair has become necessary. 
  Khadr added that the fair comes within the context of 
bolstering trade between Britain and Syria, of "familiarizing 
British export and import companies with Syrian products, and of 
providing the opportunity to Syrian businessmen from the public, 
private, and joint sectors to take part in this fair, which we 
consider more of a demonstration than a fair." 
  In a related development, AL-HAYAH has also interviewed Dr. 
Ratib al- Shallah, chairman of the Chambers of Commerce Union 
and of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce. He pointed out that the 
idea of the fair emanates from Syria's keenness on the future, 
"especially since what we produced a few years ago wasn't enough 
for us, whereas we produce a surplus now as a result of the 
projects implemented in accordance with Investment Law No. 10 of 
1991." 
  Al-Shallah noted that the goal of the fair is to familiarize 
the Syrian producer with world markets "so he can hear praise, 
criticism, and recommendations; so he can learn the type of 
standards demanded by the world market; and so he can be in 
constant contact with available technologies that enable him to 
compete in world markets." 
  Despite praising his country for producing an agricultural 
and industrial surplus, al-Shallah said that Syria does not want 
to encounter a crisis of production surplus for which there are 
no markets, "whether at home or abroad or in terms of quality or 
of prices." 
  Answering a question on whether displayed products reflect 
the degree of development achieved by Syria in the industrial 
and agricultural sectors, al-Shallah, who is a prominent Syrian 
businessman, said, "The fair doesn't at all reflect the true 
character of Syria's agricultural and industrial production." He 
added that officials of the Chambers of Commerce Union and of 
the Damascus Chamber of Commerce were not able to contact all 
producers, especially those who have no surplus to sell. "But we 
expect that participation by Syrian producers in future fairs 
will be much stronger." 
  Adib Ghanam, the assistant information minister, said in the 
question-and-answer session of the symposium that in addition to 
the current television channel, Syria plans to establish a 
television channel operated by artificial satellites. He told 
AL-HAYAH that Syria has concluded an agreement with Arabsat, 
Arab Satellite, to start transmitting via artificial satellites 
by 1996. He said that the channel will transmit in Arabic and 
English. 
  Martin Baker, the official in charge of the branch that 
deals 
with British exports to Asia, Africa, and Australia at the 
British Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has said that Mike 
Heseltine, the British secretary of trade and industry, has 
decided that Syria will be included in a list of 80 countries to 
which Britain aspires to export. Baker added that tourism is the 
most attractive sphere of investment in Syria currently. 
  A participant asked Dr. al-'Imadi if multiple currency 
exchange rates continue to exist in Syria and if there is a 
possibility of floating Syrian currency or of establishing a 
single uniform price for the Syrian pound in the near future. 
The minister answered, "The purpose of the policy embraced by 
the Syrian Government recently is to unify the exchange rates so 
they will be as close to the market rate as possible." Al-'Imadi 
noted that unifying the various exchange rates has created the 
so-called "neighboring countries exchange rate." 
  Al-'Imadi added that customs tariffs have been applied as of 
the beginning of this month on the basis of the average exchange 
rate, which is 23 pounds per dollar instead of 11.25 pounds per 
dollar, excluding foodstuffs and raw materials. However, 
al-'Imadi warned that changing exchange rates dictates that the 
Syrian Government be aware of the social ramifications. 
  Dr. Ratib al-Shallah said that, even though it is desirable 
to have a unified exchange rate, the step could be "costly" to 
some people. As an example, he cited the question of applying an 
exchange rate of 44 or 45 pounds per dollar to assess customs 
tariffs. He said that such a rate would pose hardship to the 
working classes and to people with a limited income.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "India's Options To Match Pak </F>
Threat"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, April 27--The Indian Air Force is 
understood to have submitted several options before the 
government to meet threats emerging from Pakistan's likely 
acquisition of 38 more multi-role F-16 fighters from the United 
States. 
  Among the options under active consideration is a package 
comprising an additional squadron of the Russian Mig-29, a 
unirole air superiority fighter, along with up to three more 
squadrons of the French Mirage-2000 multi-role aircraft. The IAF 
[Indian Air Force] presently has two and three squadrons each of 
the Mirage-2000 and Mig-29 aircrafts. However, a proposal to 
induct an additional squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and 
Mig-29, submitted during the tenure of the former chief of air 
staff, Air Chief Marshal N.C. Suri, has been hanging fire for 
almost two years now on account of indecision and the prevailing 
resource crunch. 
  Other options projected by the IAF include induction of a 
second multi-role fighter variant in addition to the Mirage-2000 
and even examining the Russian offer to jointly produce the long 
range Su-27 interceptors, which have already been acquired by 
China. 
  Looking beyond the figure of 38 F-16s that the Pakistan Air 
Force (PAF) is set to acquire, the IAF requirement projections 
are catering for the total 71 more such aircraft that Pakistan 
is seeking to obtain from the United States. Taking into account 
the 37 F-16s already in the PAF's inventory, the IAF is drawing 
up long-term plans to counter the final figure of 108 F-16s or 
six squadrons worth of this nuclear weapon delivery capable 
aircraft that the PAF hopes to have before the end of this 
century. 
  In principle, the IAF is of the opinion that the multi-role 
nuclear weapon delivery capable F-16 has to be met with a 
multi-role aircraft. While the IAF is interested in the more 
advanced `M' version of the Mig-29 (India presently only has the 
Mig-29B version), this aircraft type alone will not be the 
answer to the F-16 since the Mig-29 is essentially a unirole 
interceptor. 
  Similarly, defence experts point out that a unirole deep 
penetration strike aircraft would again not be viable since a 
strike mission would require a package of air defence aircraft 
for protection against enemy interception. This would involve 
many more aircraft per mission not to mention cost of fuel and 
the time involved. 
  A multi-role aircraft could switch roles from strike to air 
defence and vice versa. Till now the two PAF F-16 squadrons 
comprising 37 aircraft were matched by IAF's two Mirage-2000 
squadrons comprising 45 aircraft (including reserve). Besides, 
the two present PAF F-16 squadrons were more likely to be 
involved in air defence roles owing to fewer numbers of this 
aircraft type available to them and the fact that Pakistan 
lacking in geographical depth needed superior aircrafts to 
protect high value targets such as its all important nuclear 
programme facility at Kakuta, Karachi port, Sargodha and 
Chaklala air bases, etc. 
  But with a total six squadrons of F-16s, defence experts 
point out that the balance would be substantially tilted in the 
PAF's favour providing it with a phenomenal long arm and 
rendering vulnerable many key locations of strategic importance 
located deep inside Indian territory. These include Bombay High, 
the vast industrial complex stretching from Ahmedabad to Bombay, 
the HAL and IAF Mig-27 and Mig-23 assembly and overhauling 
facilities at Ozhar not to mention New Delhi, the Mathura 
refinery, etc. 
  Significantly, whlie all variants of three F-16s are capable 
of delivering nuclear weapons, the IAF has no such aircraft 
which includes the Mirage-2000H that it has. The numerical 
strength that the IAF enjoys vis-a-vis the PAF holds no value 
owing to two main reasons. Firstly, the IAF has to cater to its 
vast borders on both the western and eastern fronts, and 
secondly, owing to the old vintage of IAF's aircraft. While the 
bulk of the PAF fighter fleet is of medium to state-of-the-art 
technology, the bulk of IAF's fleet ranges from medium to low 
technology. 
  In fact a new area of concern is the nine odd squadrons of 
the Type 77 and Type 96 variants of the Mig-21 that the IAF will 
be phasing out by the end of this century. In any case these 
aircraft have already outlives their life and cannot be put to 
frontline use. From where will the IAF find a replacement? One 
possibility is buying up the Mig-29 assembly line which was 
offered to India in the 1980s. Another option is to accept the 
Russian offer to jointly produce the Su-27. 
  But whatever be the final outcome, it is evident that IAF's 
answer to the PAF's F-16s will rest on the sole consideration of 
resources available to buy matching aircraft. A Mig-29 will not 
be less than Rs 50 crores [rupees] a piece while a single 
Mirage-2000 will not cost less than Rs 80 crores. An expensive 
proposition no doubt, but prosperity has always hinged on 
security.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 28--The Information and 
Broadcasting Minister, Mr K.P. Singh Deo, today said foreign 
newspapers would not be allowed entry into India till the 
Cabinet had examined the issue in all its implications, reports 
UNI. 
  Replying to a two-day debate in the Rajya Sabha on the 
working of his Ministry, Mr Singh Deo said the final decision 
would have to be taken by the Cabinet as his Ministry alone was 
not competent to decide the issue. 
  He said the Government's current stand was based on a 
Cabinet 
decision of 1955 which had disfavoured the entry of foreign 
newspapers. 
  The Jawaharlal Nehru Cabinet had taken the decision 
following 
the recommendation of the first Press Commission which had 
studied the issue of ownership of newspapers. 
  It had recommended against permitting Indian editions of 
foreign newspapers even with Indian equity participation. He 
informed the House that the issue had been debated in the 
country and there were some court cases. 
  Mr Singh Deo said the study to be conducted by the Centre of 
Media Studies would be completed in eight months at a cost of Rs 
one million [rupees]. At the same time, students of the Film and 
Television Institute of India were also making their own studies 
into this matter as a part of their course. 
  He said Doordarshan's own coverage would increase vastly 
with 
the launch in 1995 of INSAT-2B, which would be devoted totally 
to telecommunications and information including radio and 
television. 
  He said there were reports that there would be 118 foreign 
networks beaming into India very soon and so the Ministry had 
written to the owners of the foreign channels and also to Indian 
missions abroad to apprise them of the country's point of view. 
  Talking on the expansion of Doordarshan, he said the Metro 
channel was being received terrestrially in Delhi, Bombay, 
Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad and Lucknow. In the second phase, 
this will be received terrestrially in all State capitals and 
two mega cities, and all other cities in the third phase. 
  Mr Singh Deo announced that the Supreme Court had vacated 
the 
stay imposed by Delhi High Court on the scheme for private 
producer participation in the satellite channels. However, the 
apex court had ruled that any scheme drawn up by Doordarshan 
will have to be shown to it. 
  He said the Government would draw up an appropriate scheme 
for participation of private producers since Doordarshan alone 
could not produce the programmes to fill the 14,400 hours of 
telecast time available per year.

  [Text] India has informed the member States of the South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation [SAARC] of its 
inability to host the eighth SAARC summit in November. Instead, 
Delhi has offered to host the summit in April 1995, senior 
External Affairs Ministry sources told THE STATESMAN over the 
phone. 
  The Prime Minister's preoccupation with elections in several 
States--which are scheduled between November and March--was 
cited as the cause for the postponement. 
  The SAARC charter stipulates that heads of States and 
Governments of the member States meet once a year. 
  The postponement of the eighth SAARC summit will upset the 
summit cycle. Officials point out that the ninth summit cannot 
be organized in the winter of 1995, as there is no provision for 
two meetings in one year. 
  However, India intends to get the decision ratified in the 
July meeting of the SAARC Foreign Ministers in Dhaka.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 21 (PTI)--The National Council of 
Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has forecast double-digit 
inflation to bedevil the economy in the current year, despite 
the government's recent assertion to the contrary. 
  In a macro analysis of the economy for 1994-95, the third 
year of the eighth plan, the council said the year should see 
"significant improvement" in economic growth, though inflation 
is expected to climb. 
  It said the level of average prices of different sectors (an 
index similar to wholesale price index) is projected to rise by 
10.2 per cent for the year as a whole in 1994-95 over 1993-94 
average. The impact of various administered prices is 
incorporated into this estimate, the council said barring 
further significant increases in procurement prices of grains. 
  The council said the rise in the price of manufactured items 
is higher than agricultural prices--a phenomenon noted in 
1993-94 as well--is due to enhanced industrial activity, higher 
capacity utilisation and hence higher mark-ups. 
  Presenting two sets of GDP (gross domestic product) growth 
for the current year, the council said the GDP at factor cost in 
constant prices is estimated to rise by 4.8 per cent in 1994-95 
over the last year. The GDP growth at this level will equal the 
growth rate scored in 1990-91. 
  In the alternative scenario with lower agricultural output 
and higher agricultural prices, the real growth drops to 4 per 
cent, giving a lower end of expectations for 1994-95. 
  The council contended that despite the problems of inflation 
which would call for "careful management," the economy seems to 
be set for recovery. 
  Referring to the reasons for its optimistic outlook on the 
recovery of the economy, the Council said, for the first time, 
both industrial growth and real GDP growth are mainly dependent 
on the growth in private investment expenditures. 
  Stating that in the past the major factor was the public 
investment, it said in 1994-95 public investment expenditures 
are expected to grow by 8 per cent, while private investment 
expenditures will grow by 31 per cent. 
  This sound growth in private investment expenditure, the 
council said, is due to the high business expectations for the 
next six months, substantial reduction in direct taxes and 
considerably enhanced inflows of investment from abroad along 
with improvement in mobilisation of funds from the domestic 
market. 
  It said the external factors for the economy seem 
`promising' as the economies in North America and western Europe 
were reported to be on the path of recovery from the downswing 
of the business cycle of the recent years. 
  The two macro models prepared by NCAER are contingent on the 
assumption that the monsoon is below `normal' like last year or 
in which it is much worse than last year. Significantly, the 
growth of agricultural production in both the scenarios is not 
very different at 2.6 per cent and 2.3 per cent respectively, 
the council said. 
  The models showed that the overall industrial output, 
including construction but excluding mining and quarrying, is 
projected to rise by 6.8 per cent and a major part of the 
increase is to come from the capital goods sector which is 
likely to get a reprieve from its recession through a recovery 
in private investment activity. 
  The council said the cuts in corporate income-tax, extension 
of MODVAT (modified value-added tax) to capital goods provided 
in this year's Union budget are likely to spur investment 
activity and hence the capital goods sector.

  [Text] In spite of its differences with the Left Front 
Government in West Bengal, the CPI(ML) [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist-Leninist], Liberation favours a broad unity of the 
Left forces at the national level, to dislodge the Congress(I) 
Government at the Centre. This was stated by Mr Vinode Misra, 
general secretary of the party, in Calcutta on Friday. He 
addressed a rally at Sahid Minar to commemorate the 25th 
anniversary of the CPI(ML). 
  A procession was organized during the day from Deshbandhu 
park to Esplanade, with peasants from Bihar and West Bengal. 
  Criticizing the "parliamentary, social democratic and 
opportunist CPI [Communist Party of India] and CPI(M) [Communist 
Party of India-Marxist]," Mr Misra said they were interested 
more in keeping the Left Front Government in power in West 
Bengal than in building up a genuine Left movement against the 
Centre. 
  He, however, added that the Liberation would oppose any move 
by the Congress(I) and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] to 
dislodge the Front Government in West Bengal. 
  Mr Misra ruled out the possibility of inviting the CPI and 
the CPI(M) to the convention of the Left organizations in New 
Delhi on April 25 and 26, to draw a common programme of action 
to oppose the Dunkel proposals. 
  He claimed the Liberation had revised its policies in 
accordance with the changing situation and was in a position to 
provide leadership to the Left movement in the country. 
  "We are the only true Naxalite group in the country," Mr 
Misra asserted. 
  Commenting on the recent clashes between the Liberation and 
the MCC [Maoist Communist Center (Bihar Extremist Group)] 
activists in Bihar, he said the former was prepared for talks 
with the MCC "unconditionally," to end the violence.

  [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, April 23--The CPI(M) [Communist 
Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr E.M.S. Namboodiripad, said 
today that the opposition to India's signing of the GATT 
[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] was likely to develop 
into a major political crisis for the Narasimha Rao Government, 
which is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha, report PTI and UNI. 
  The GATT would cause amendments to several existing laws in 
India, and with the Congress(I) in a minority in Rajya Sabha 
there was no guarantee that the ruling party would emerge a 
victor in its legislative efforts in the Upper House, Mr 
Namboodiripad said. 
  He was inaugurating a series of seminars, programmed by the 
Thiruvananthapuram Press Club. The opening seminar was on "GATT 
and Kerala." 
  Mr Namboodiripad said apart from the fact that all the 
non-Congress(I) Opposition parties were against India signing 
the GATT, even within the Congress(I), leaders like Mr Arjun 
Singh were of the view that the Congress(I) should have 
attempted to evolve a consensus on the question of signing of 
the GATT. 
  By signing the GATT which jeopardized the country's economic 
sovereignty, the Narasimha Rao Government had in one stroke 
jettisoned the positive aspects of the Nehruvian policies being 
pursued by the country, Mr Namboodiripad said. 
  The signing of GATT had aggravated the negative aspects of 
these policies which the Communist Party had been opposing since 
the second Five-Year Plan, he said. 
  The foreign investment in India was now more in the share 
market than in setting up new industries, he pointed out. Mr 
Namboodiripad added that even industrialists had expressed 
apprehension about the policies pursued by the Narasimha Rao 
Government. 
  He said the Left parties had planned to launch in August a 
civil disobedience movement in which some 10 lakh people were 
expected to participate. 
  The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] is chalking out a programme 
of action to mobilize public opinion against the GATT, the party 
spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said here today. 
  He said the BJP plans to have Jan Adalats, where 
the GATT issue would be taken up and its implications to the 
Nation's economic sovereignty would be publicized. 
  The party workers would also court arrest, Mr Sharma told 
reporters. He said the programme to oppose the GATT outside 
Parliament would be drawn up by a three-member committee set up 
by the party. 
  Mr Sharma reiterated the party's demand that the Government 
should hold a referendum on the issue instead of merely taking 
it up for discussion in Parliament. 
  He said the GATT was one issue on which all the Opposition 
parties had a similar stand, but felt that the initiative for 
joint action should come from other political parties as well.

  [Text] Mr Manoranjan Hazra, former CPI(M) [Communist Party 
of India-Marxist] MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and a 
prominent leader of the newly formed Proletarian Revolutionary 
Party of India [PRPI], will contest the forthcoming Assembly 
by-polls at Serampore in Hooghly district on a PRPI ticket, the 
party general secretary, Mr Sumanta Hira, said on Sunday. 
  The PRPI candidate will be supported by a 10-party combine 
including the SUCI [Socialist Unity Center of India] and the 
CPI(M-L) [Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist], Mr Hira 
said. 
  Mr Hazra has already begun a door-to-door campaign to garner 
votes for himself. Being new, his party, not surprisingly, has a 
limited following in Serampore. 
  The Congress(I), Mr Hazra said, had won the past three 
Assembly polls in the constituency on the strength of the 
"negative votes," cast against the CPI(M). 
  The PRPI leadership is reportedly of the view that Mr Hazra 
will cut into the votes of both the Congress(I) and the CPI(M). 
  Mr Hazra would get the Congress(I) votes because of his 
association with the freedom movement, Mr Hira said. 
  Traditional CPI(M) voters, he added, would also support Mr 
Hazra as he had initiated several development projects in 
Serampore.

<F P=106> [Article by Subrata Sen: "Amendment Likely To Clip Seshan's </F>
Powers"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, April 25--In a move apparently aimed at 
clipping the wings of the Chief Election Commissioner, Mr T.N. 
Seshan, the Government has decided to bring a Constitution 
amendment Bill during the current session of Parliament. The 
Bill is intended to make the functioning of the multi-member 
Election Commission well-defined and effective. 
  The draft of the proposed Constitution amendment Bill has 
already been finalized by the Union Law Ministry and is expected 
to be circulated to leaders of all political parties soon. 
Besides amending the Constitution, the Union Government is also 
contemplating changing the Representation of People's Act [RPA], 
1950, regarding the definition of the term, "ordinarily 
resident," which makes it mandatory for a Rajya Sabha member to 
belong to a State from where he is elected. 
  The proposed Constitution amendment regarding the 
functioning 
of the Election Commission consists of three points: 

  -  Equate other Election Commissioners with the Chief 
Election Commissioner in the matter of their removal from 
office 
  -  Provide for the conduct of the business of the Election 
Commission 
  -  Provide for a prohibition as to the holding of office 
by members of the commission after ceasing to be such members. 

  By these amendments, the Union Government wanted to equate 
the other Election Commissioners with the Chief Election 
Commissioner by making their appointments to last a full term, 
unless nullified by an impeachment motion in Parliament. 
  The business of the Election Commission would provide 
clear-cut guidelines regarding the functioning of the Election 
Commissioners, who, after the amendment, could act as a check 
and balance against any unilateral decision taken by the CEC 
[Chief Election Commissioner]. 
  The amendment to the RPA, regarding the redefining of 
"ordinarily resident" status for the Rajya Sabha members was 
necessitated as several members of the ruling party, including 
some Ministers, were facing inquiries by the Election Commission 
on the basis of this clause in the RPA. 
  That the Government has taken a decision on a Constitution 
amendment Bill regarding the functioning of the Election 
Commission was indicated today to some leaders of the Opposition 
parties, although informally, by the Parliamentary Affairs 
Minister, Mr V.C. Shukla, during an informal luncheon meeting 
convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr Shivraj Patil. 
  The Opposition members, specially those from the Left, 
objected to the Government's decision to redefine the ordinary 
resident status by changing the RPA. They, however, agreed to 
the proposed Constitution amendment Bill on the functioning of 
the EC, provided the Government also went in for one or more 
Bills to have a comprehensive electoral reform. 
  Sources said that the Opposition parties did not want that a 
signal be sent that Parliament was eager to clip the wings of Mr 
Seshan by bringing in a Constitution amendment. 
  The Opposition parties were also of the opinion that while a 
Bill pertaining to electoral reforms was welcome during the 
current session of Parliament, the process should involve all 
the major political parties in the country.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 25--The Supreme Court today 
clarified that the Chief Election Commissioner, Mr T.N. Seshan, 
could take action for alleged breach of the code of conduct 
after the issuance of the by-election notification... 
  A Division Bench comprising Mr Justice J.S. Verma and Mr 
Justice S.P. Bharucha, said: 

  -  The court made it clear that its interim order of April 4, 
1994, was made and intended to operate only till the time of 
issuance of the statutory notification. 
  -  As such notification was 
expected shortly, the CEC had sought modification of the April 4 
order. 
  -  From the submission of the CEC, it seems that it was 
merely for the clarification of the said order. 
  -  The only dispute 
raised by the writ petition of the Andhra Government was 
regarding the enforceability of the Model Code of Conduct prior 
to the issue of the poll notification under the RPA which 
commenced with the election process. 
  -  The petition also pertained 
to the question whether the code had legal sanction in case of a 
breach, of the code prior to the issue of the statutory 
notification calling for the by-elections 31 days from the 
actual poll date. 
  -  The petition by the Andhra Pradesh Government 
did not raise the dispute regarding the desirability and 
enforceability of the model code from the time of issuance of 
the poll notification. 

  That order had come on a petition by the Andhra Pradesh 
Government seeking a restraint on the CEC from stopping the 
State from going ahead with certain schemes in the Kurnool Lok 
Sabha seat, where by-elections are due next month, with effect 
from the date of announcement of the poll instead of the 
notification date.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 28--Mrs Margaret Alva, Minister of 
State for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, today said 
in the Rajya Sabha that till a court ruling was available, the 
Government would abide by the opinion expressed by the former 
Attorney General that the Centre and State Governments, not the 
Election Commission, were empowered to take action against 
officers indicted by the Election Commission on various grounds. 
  Mrs Alva said this while informing the House during Question 
Hour that the Election Commission had moved the Supreme Court, 
seeking a ruling on its authority to take disciplinary action 
against the officials. 
  (UNI adds from Pune: The Chief Election Commissioner, Mr 
T.N. 
Seshan, today warned that the Election Commission would strictly 
abide by the ceiling on election expenditure and any candidate 
or political party found exceeding the limit would be dealt with 
firmly. However, he conceded that the ceiling of Rs 1.5 lakh 
[rupees] was low and needed to be raised or abolished. 
  He also warned that action under the Indian Penal Code would 
be initiated against political parties found spending on behalf 
of a candidate without his consent.) 
  Earlier, a section of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha 
accused the Centre of protecting officials indicted by the 
Election Commission for tardy functioning while on poll-related 
duty. 
  The Election Commission had indicted 28 officials, Mrs Alva 
said, and, as per the procedures specified in the service 
conduct rules, the concerned Ministries were making preliminary 
inquiries to ascertain if regular departmental action was 
required against them. 
  The House was told that after preliminary inquiries, charges 
had been dropped against five officials, two had retired, 
departmental inquiries were being conducted against two, and 
action had been taken against one.

  [Text] Pune, April 28--The chief election commissioner, Mr 
T.N. Seshan, said today he will strictly enforce the Rs 1.5-lakh 
ceiling on election expenses of a candidate and threatened 
political parties and their candidates with invoking Indian 
Penal Code [IPC] if they attempted to circumvent the ceiling, 
reports PTI. 
  Mr Seshan told representatives of political parties here 
that 
the IPC section 171(H) prohibited expenses of more than Rs 10 by 
"anybody," a term, he said, which included political parties 
too, on behalf of the candidate without the candidate's consent. 
  "And if the candidate gives his consent for such expenses, 
those expenses would be included in his election expenses for 
which the ceiling under the Representation of People's Act (RPA) 
section 77 is Rs 1.5 lakh," he said, warning that exceeding the 
ceiling would mean villation of the RPA. 
  Mr Seshan described the Rs 1.5 lakh ceiling as a "joke, 
which 
needs either to be increased or abolished," but nevertheless he 
asserted its strict implementation since the provision was 
enacted by Parliament. 
  He is on a three-day visit to supervise poll preparations in 
the Ahmednagar and Baramati Lok Sabha constituencies. 
  Mr Seshan, in response to a suggestion by a political 
leader, 
said a decision on the proposal to provide polling slips to 
voters either by the government or by the election commission 
itself would be taken by May 2. 
  He said there was no ban on candidates going to religious 
places but "direct or indirect political propaganda" inside such 
places of worship was liable for penal action. 
  Mr Seshan welcomed a suggestion to appoint an observer 
during 
elections to monitor use of religion for political gain. 
  The entire election process will be video-taped which would 
make it easy to detect violation of model code of conduct for 
elections by political parties and candidates. 
  He directed the district election machinery to widely 
advertise through newspapers for knowledge of voters that all 
ballots would be mixed together before counting as a step to 
protect the identity of voters and prevent post-election 
intimidation. 
  The election commission would send 600 central police 
personnel to assist the local administration during the polling. 
  Among those who attended the meeting were the Congress 
leaders, Bapusaheb Thite, who would be the party's candidate for 
the Baramati by-election, a Congress MP [member of Parliament], 
Mr Vidura Navale, the district Congress president, Mr Krishnarao 
Bhegade, the Janata Dal leader, Mr Shambhajirao Kakade, among 
others. 
  Mr Seshan also denied reports that he allegedly "snubbed" 
the 
Congress MP from Kopargaon, Mr Shankarrao Kale, at the meeting 
with representatives of political parties at Ahmednagar 
yesterday. 
  "I did not know that he is a MP," Mr Seshan told political 
leaders who met him here while denying that he humiliated Mr 
Kale whom he described as a senior parliamentarian. 
  "Join a political party and I will talk to you," is how Mr 
Seshan dismissed a journalist who wanted to elicit more 
information on the election process. 
  "I have lost confidence in the press," he told journalists. 
  Mr Seshan went on to cite his personal medical reports 
saying 
he would speak to journalists on any topic other than those 
under his official purview. "Press of India is a good means (to 
achieve ends). But today I do not use it as a means and want no 
benefit from it," he added.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 22--In a significant development, 
the NHRC [National Human Rights Commission] has held the Border 
Security Force [BSF] personnel responsible for firing live 
ammunition at an unarmed crowd at Bijbehara in Kashmir on 
October 22. The firing had killed 37 and injured 73. 
  In its report, the NHRC recommended immediate proceedings 
for 
the prosecution of the 14 "guilty" officials identified by the 
Magisterial Inquiry. 
  The NHRC asked the Centre to undertake a thorough review of 
the circumstances and conditions in which BSF units were 
deployed to operate in situations involving solely civilian 
populations. 
  Also, it sought payment of Rs 50,000 [rupees], as 
compensation, to the next of kin of those killed; Rs 25,000 to 
those injured by bullets and Rs 10,000 to those who sustained 
other injuries. 
  The report was accepted by the Centre and an "action-taken 
report" tabled simultaneously. 
  The commission's report said that the evidence collected in 
the inquiry under the BSF Act, shows, prima facie, 
that a sizeable group of local residents had gathered after 
prayers at the Jama Masjid and had later moved to the national 
highway. There they were accosted by a BSF unit. 
  "The evidence provided to the Staff Court of Inquiry by 
those 
in the procession," the report pointed out, "states that there 
were no armed militants in the crowd, the members of which were 
shouting political slogans and slogans against the siege of the 
Hazratbal shrine by the Defence forces." 
  The NHRC report added that with the exception of one 
witness--from the six whose evidence was recorded--none of the 
others referred to any altercations between the people in the 
crowd and the BSF personnel. In fact, the witnesses stated that 
the people in the crowd were unarmed and that the firing by the 
BSF on the crowd was "without warning." 
  The NHRC noted that although the situation in the Valley 
called for firm measures, the firing of live ammunition into a 
crowd of unarmed civilians could not be condoned. 
  The commission told the Centre to keep it informed of the 
action--taken on its recommendations--and also of any measures 
being contemplated against those identified in the Magisterial 
Inquiry and Staff Court of Inquiry. 
  The Ministry of Home Affairs, which released the 
"action-taken" report, stated that Record of Evidence 
proceedings had already been initiated against 14 BSF personnel. 
  It said that the BSF authorities had been instructed to 
complete the proceedings expeditiously. Investigations into a 
case, registered in the local police station, had reportedly 
been completed and steps had been initiated to file a 
chargesheet against the indicted personnel. 
  The Ministry claimed that the following steps had been 
undertaken by the BSF to ensure proper safety of civilians: 

  -  The training syllabus emphasized respect for human rights 
and ways to deal with the public, particularly with the elderly,

  [Text] Bangalore, April 28--The Bangalore-based National 
Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) has designed and developed an 
Integrated Flight Data Processing (IFDP) system at a cost of Rs. 
40 lakhs [rupees] for all types of Digital Flight Data Recorder 
(DFDR), commonly known as Black Box in aviation parlance, and 
Quick Access Recorder (QAR) used by Air India. 
  According to Dr K.N. Raju, NAL director, the system, 
developed in a record time of nine months, is based on Tata 
Unisys U600/60 mini computer. It could be used to acquire data 
from four known sources of DFDRs and QARs simultaneously to 
speed up data acquisition. 
  The system is also capable of processing the raw data, 
acquiring data from a specific GMT, data transcription, 
conversion of engineering units and display of selected 
parameters. It could also check on various parameter limit 
"exceedencies" during a selected flight. 
  Dr Raju said the system developed at Air India's behest 
could 
also reply and analyse flight data recorded either on DFDR or on 
performance monitoring recorders (PMRs) to provide vital clues 
during investigation of accidents or incidents. It would now be 
available to other air taxi operators in the country following a 
Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directive that it 
would be mandatory for these operators to have data from DFRs 
for at least three months. 
  Stating that most of the private operators were not even 
maintaining the Black Box properly, Dr Raju said an additional 
feature of the system was that it contained a special event 
search monitoring and analysis software. 
  The software sets up a database of all the detected events, 
allowing them to be interrogated by time period and aircraft 
registration with the output used to assess which operating 
techniques or other characteristics were causing erosion of 
safety margins. The routine information generated by this 
analysis was complementary to the assessments by pilots and 
would enhance air safety. The IFDP had provision to achieve the 
processed data on a mass storage media for potential 
applications such as engine health monitoring flight operation 
analysis and fuel efficiency monitoring. 
  According to Dr Raju, the IFDP had a good export potential 
as 
it would cost 50 to 60 per cent less than the available data 
readers abroad. Further, it would also help the aircraft 
operators to get readouts of the black box within the country, 
as at present they had to seek sources from abroad for such 
readouts. 
  According to Dr S. Nagabhushana, head of the Aerospace Lab 
of 
NAL, the laboratories had over the past five years developed 
expertise in the readout and analysis of both the Black 
Boxes--the DFDRs and the Cockpit Voice Recorders (CVRs) of 
aircraft including Boeing 737 and 747, Airbus A300, A310 and 
A320. The system for the Sundstrand Universal Flight data 
recorder (UFDRs) used by the 737 Boeings with air taxi services 
which would be available in a month's time. 
  Dr Nagabhushana said though DFDRs generally confirm to the 
Aeronautical Radio Incorporated (ARINC) 573 standards, each 
aircraft was fitted with DFDRs of different makes, necessitating 
tailor-made systems both in terms of hardware and software. 
  NAL had specialised in addressing these problems and had 
acquired indigenous capability to develop sophisticated readout 
systems. 
  The related future plans before NAL included four 
dimensional 
flight path reconstruction, analysis of damaged tapes (accident 
investigation), realtime satellite data links using Inmarsat and 
development of solid state DFDRs used in Boeing 747--400s. 
  The IFDP would be handed over to Air India here on May 4.

  [Text] Tehran, 15 Ordibehesht [5 May] KEYHAN News Service 
-- Hafez Ahmad Bakhsh, general secretary of the Pakistan Corps 
of the Companions, threatened that if the project to lay the 
Iranian gas pipeline across Pakistan to India is carried out, 
this corps' agents will vigorously fight it. 
  He gave a press conference in Pakistan's Sind Province in 
which he accused Iran of interfering in Pakistan's domestic 
affairs. He said: Ever since Pakistan's new government first 
came to power, Iran has continuously interfered in our country's 
domestic affairs. 
  The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions, which 
receives financial and political support from Saudi Arabia, said 
that the existence of Iran's cultural houses in Pakistan's 
cities is a danger to Pakistan's security. He said: The Corps of 
the Companions has expressed concern about the existence of 
Iran's cultural houses in eight of Pakistan's cities and it 
demands that the constant entry of Iranian delegations into 
Pakistan be stopped. 
  He expressed sharp opposition to the project to lay Iran's 
gas pipeline across Pakistan to India, calling it interference 
in Pakistan's domestic affairs. He warned that the Corps of the 
Companions will not permit one inch of this pipeline to cross 
Pakistani soil. 
  Hafez Ahmad protested the move by the Islamabad government 
to 
expel Arab terrorists residing in Pakistan. He called them Arab 
mojahedin and said: The current government of Pakistan has 
called the Arab mojahedin living in Pakistan terrorists and has 
ordered their expulsion, yet they fought to protect Pakistan's 
territorial integrity. The Islamabad government has recently 
arrested several Arabs living in Pakistan for the crime of 
creating fear and terror and for engaging in terrorist acts, and 
intends to expel them from Pakistan. 
  The general secretary of the Corps of the Companions warned 
the Islamabad government not to expel the Arab terrorists and 
said: If the Arab mojahedin are treated in an inappropriate and 
unethical way, the Corps of the Companions will vigorously fight 
this action. 
  The Corps of the Companions is one of the Pakistani groups 
that have caused many factional and religious clashes in this 
country. This corps, which is maintained by Saudi Arabia, is 
openly hostile to the Shiites of Pakistan, and one of its 
permanent programs is to mount armed attacks against Shiite 
religious and ideological gatherings and to kill and maim 
innocent people.

  [Text] Kerman, 23 Farvardin [12 April] KEYHAN News Service 
-- Speaking to a group of students in the municipality of 
Sirjan, the executive vice-president of the republic said: With 
the completed construction of 80 dams by the end of the Second 
Five-Year Plan, 70 percent of the nation's surface water will be 
captured. 
  Hamid Mirzadeh, executive vice-president of the republic, 
also discussed the government's economic, social, development, 
and policymaking plans. He said: During the First Five-Year 
Plan, the government was able to take effective steps along with 
the nation to create suitable conditions for more investments 
throughout the country, and in this regard it has so far made 
great changes in the industrial sector. He added: Construction 
is under way right now on 80 water-earth dams, and when these 
projects go into full operation 70 percent of the nation's water 
will be anchored. 
  He said the annual water existing in the country is 120 
billion cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]]. He said: Despite all the 
efforts that have been made, only 20 billion m[.sup]3[/] of 
water is anchored annually. 
  Mirzadeh noted that in the last few years major changes have 
been made in the industrial sector. He said: Steel production, 
which has not even reached 1 million tons per year in the last 
few years, is now four times greater annually. 
  He also discussed literacy training. He said: Fortunately, 
with the attention that has been given to this matter, 
illiteracy has decreased from 50 percent to less than 20 percent. 
  Continuing his remarks, the executive vice-president of the 
republic said: The government is trying, through increased 
investments, to improve the nation's economy. In this regard, 
since the beginning of the current year [21 March 1994], several 
large projects have gone into operation, including the Sarijan 
Gol Gahar Iron Ore Complex.

  [Text] How well Egyptian security has done, after they 
began to understand the basic fact that they were facing an 
enemy who should not be taken lightly. The enemy is not a bunch 
of crooks or fools, but rather it is a group of organizations 
that plan and execute and are trained to kill, use explosives, 
and assassinate. How well Major General Hassan al-Alfi, Egypt's 
minister of the interior, has done when he recently announced 
the discovery of a dangerous terrorist organization. 
  Following the murder of one of the important major generals, 
Ra'uf Khayrat, the deputy chief of state security and, for many 
years, the man responsible for counter-terrorist activity, 
rumors and questions spread on Egyptian streets. Questions have 
been raised about the possibility that the terrorist 
organizations may have been able to penetrate the security 
apparatus, especially after Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayrat was 
assassinated. He was not well known to the public, and the 
thinking was that this was his best protection. No one guarded 
him, he drove his own car, and he used pseudonyms. He never 
resided in one place, but moved among several houses that were 
leased to him. 
  Thus, a logical question would appear to be: Was the 
security 
operation penetrated and information leaked about the movements 
and life of Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayrat, facilitating his 
surveillance and assassination by brutal means unlike previous 
assassination operations? Three groups took part, two to do the 
shooting and a third to throw the bomb to blow up the car to 
make sure he was dead. 
  Thus, the only time that Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Hasan 
al-Alfi became agitated was when he was asked about the extent 
of penetration of the Interior Ministry's agencies by 
terrorists. That he was clearly irritated was evident to dozens 
of media persons who were keen to attend the conference. He 
said: "Who has penetrated the security operations? Terrorists? 
Absolutely not! On the contrary, they are the ones that have 
been penetrated." 
  The minister did not want mere irritation to be his defense 
of his security apparatus. On the contrary, he cited facts and 
figures, pointing out that security had foiled 20 major 
terrorist operations in 1994 during the last three months. They 
included a series of violent and destructive acts, as well as 
the assassination of prominent public figures and innocent 
bystanders. Security was able to capture 43 terrorists, some of 
whom died in gunfire with security forces. This figure was out 
of a total of 52 terrorists on the wanted list--an 
over-82-percent success rate. 
  Therefore, the minister's numbers refute any possibility of 
security's penetration by terrorists. One sould understand the 
assassination of Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayrat within the context 
of--if he was not well known to the public, the terrorist groups 
and all religious leaders knew the man well. Despite the fact 
that his role was to monitor these groups and devise strategies 
to counter them over the past few years, knowing and watching 
him would not be difficult for those who are sympathetic to the 
terrorists, or for those who are a part of the religious trend 
in Egypt. 
  Moreover, Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayat's methods and view of 
protection might have made it easy for terrorists to hunt him. 
In addition, his assassination was a reprisal for the latest 
operation he planned and carried out, which was to arrest the 
most dangerous terrorist organization. So far, 30 of its members 
have been arrested. 
  The minister of interior had the opportunity to delay the 
announcement concerning this organization, while waiting for 
security to complete their investigation of the events 
surrounding Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayat's assassination. Moreover, 
the minister did not need to make this announcement, [after] the 
Egyptian People's Assembly enacted the Emergency Law, which 
allows security to speed up actions against terrorism. However, 
the haste in holding the conference and revealing this 
organization, in the first place, was to refute the rumors on 
the Egyptian scene regarding the possibility that terrorist 
groups had penetrated the security apparatus. 
  As for the latest terrorist organization, described by Maj. 
Gen. Hasan al-Alfi as "extremely dangerous," the facts confirm 
that, by security being able to uncover it, security will have 
achieved an "important point" in its constant battle with 
extremist groups over the years. There is considerable evidence 
for that: 
  1. There is evidence pertaining to the leader of the 
organization, 'Adil Siyam, who was killed during the attempt to 
arrest him on 4 April 1994, and who was described as being a 
"dangerous element." He was the deputy of Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, 
head of the Jihad Organization abroad. He was responsible for 
the organization's operations inside Egypt. He had planned to 
assassinate Minister of Interior Maj. Gen. Hasan al-Alfi. He 
prepared the personnel for the ambush and persuaded one of the 
participants in the crime to carry out the suicide bombing 
mission (Diya'-al-Din Mahmud Hafiz). He was the one who planned 
to assassinate Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, Minister of 
Information Safwat al-Sharif, and UN Secretary General Dr. 
Butrus-Ghali, during his participation in the African Summit 
Conference in Cairo last summer. 
  According to unconfirmed press sources, i.e., security 
information, Siyam was responsible for a bold operation by 
digging up Salah Salim Road. This is one of the most important 
main roads in Egypt. It is 12 meters wide in a specific area. It 
was chosen carefully to be a fixed center for an explosion, 
preparatory to a terrorist operation being planned. In fact, 12 
of the organization's personnel, dressed in municipal workers 
uniforms, dug up the street, laid electrical cables under it, 
and then concealed it. They had therefore prepared a fixed spot, 
so as to target any official who passed through this street. 
They are numerous. Cellars were also found underground in nine 
locations belonging to the organization, used as storage areas 
for weapons and as places to hide any victims who might be 
abducted. In addition, there were places to create a "special 
atmosphere" for those tasked with suicide missions. This is what 
happened with those who attempted to assassinate Maj. Gen. Hasan 
al-Alfi--they became victims of their crime. They were Nazih 
Nashi Rashid and Diya'-al-Din Mahmud Hafiz. 
  In addition to all that, 'Adil Siyam planned to assassinate 
Sayyid Abu-Yahya, the primary witness in the case of the 
attempted assassination of Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi, the 
night before the trial was to begin. 
  Because of all this, it was not odd for Maj. Gen. Hasan 
al-Alfi to describe him as "one of the most dangerous terrorists 
that I have seen during the last few years of combatting 
terrorism." 
  2. There is evidence relating to the huge quantity of arms 
seized from the organization, when security forces 
simultaneously raided nine places in several governorates. This 
can be summarized as follows: 

  -  Thirty members of the terrorist organization were 
captured. Their names have not been announced, because there are 
others still being hunted. 
  -  Amounts of money valued at $7,000, 3,000 pounds sterling, and 
9,000 Egyptian pounds. 
  -  Guns, including two automatic rifles, one 
Israeli-manufactured 
'Uzi machine gun, six pistols, 17 magazines for automatic 
weapons, various pistols, 583 rounds of 9-mm ammunition, three 
RPG shells, three silencers, and a large quantity of detonators. 
  -  335 bombs of various types, explosive materials and explosive 
devices, including 5,000 detonators, 100 kilograms of high 
explosive material, sulfuric and nitrate acid, ammonia nitrate 
mercury, chlorine, ammonia salts, 150 kilograms of gelignite 
powder, and 150 kilograms of nitrite powder, which is the 
strongest form of dynamite. 
  -  A large quantity of materials and equipment required to make 
explosives. 
  -  A tricycle vehicle used as a deceptive trap, three radio 
sets, 
two wireless telephones, and magnets to attach explosives under 
vehicles. 
  -  Organizational papers and documents, including information 
about the security of installations and personnel, and ways of 
manufacturing explosives and deceptive traps. 
  -  A list of targeted persons, various organizational charts, 
and 
the organization's private code, in addition to receipts for the 
transmittal of foreign currencies abroad. 
  -  Large quantities of various uniforms, including policemen and 
armed forces, and a large amount of officers' rank emblems. 
  -  A Yemeni passport for the number one suspect 'Adil 'Awad 
Siyam. 
  -  Various types of private vehicles, including cars used in the 
incidents that the terrorist organization personnel confessed to 
committing. 


    Therefore, all these weapons and explosives seized with the 
organization are some of the evidence regarding the extent of 
this organization's dangerousness. Minister of Interior Maj. 
Gen. Hasan al-Alfi declared that this organization was 
responsible for the assassination of Sayyid Ahmad Abu-Yahya, the 
primary witness regarding the failed attempt to assassinate 
Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi on 4 February 1994. The weapons 
used in that incident have been seized. 
  Maj. Gen. Hasan al-Alfi also confirmed that this 
organization 
attempted to assassinate the minister of interior on 18 August 
1993 and detonated the explosive charge that blew up the 
al-Jazirah Youth Center on 13 July 1993, during their physical 
fitness training. In addition, there was the assassination of a 
member of an off-shoot organization, 'Adil Anwar al-Sayyid, in 
front of his home on 13 July 1993. 
  The minister was content to report on these operations 
carried out by this organization and did not mention other 
operations, which had been foiled in one way or another, to 
assassinate prominent public, political, executive, media, 
judicial, and military figures by means of blowing up 
booby-trapped vehicles. These persons include Prime Minister Dr. 
'Atif Sidqi; Fathi Surur, speaker of the People's Assembly; 
Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Hasan al-Alfi; and former ministers 
of interior, 'Abd-al-Halim Musa and Zaki Badr. Among the 
military officers are Maj. Gen. Ahmad 'Abdallah, chief of the 
Supreme Military Court; Maj. Gen. Wajdi al-Laythi, also of 
Military Justice; and the former head of State Security secret 
police, Maj. Gen. Mustafa 'Abd-al-Qadir. 
  Thus a round has ended, but not the battle. It is constantly 
escalating and taking on new dimensions, especially since 
official Egypt has abandoned playing down the phenomenon of 
terrorism and no longer holds terrorists in contempt or 
downgrades their danger. Interior Minister Maj. Gen. Hasan 
al-Alfi stated to the People's Assembly that during the past 
three years there have been 14 explosions in public places, 
resulting in 97 Egyptian deaths, including children. Extremists 
also hit 35 tourist targets, either buses carrying tourists or 
boats on the Nile. This resulted in the deaths of 12 tourists 
and the wounding of 50 more. In addition, there were eight 
explosions in banks. 
  Statistics prepared by the Ibn Khaldun Institute for 
Developmental Studies indicate the extent of the escalation of 
violence during 1992 and 1993. The statistics show that police 
victims totalled 23 in 1992 with 38 wounded, while terrorists 
killed were 39, with 83 wounded. Civilian totals were 32 and 107 
respectively. Therefore, total deaths in 1992 were 94, with 228 
wounded, a total of 322. The number of extremists arrested were 
3,645, along with 128 civilians. The figures were multiplied in 
1993. Police deaths reached 120, with 181 wounded. Extremists 
had 111 deaths and 252 wounded, while civilians totalled 101 
with 341 wounded. Total victims were 1,106, with 17,191 
terrorists and 594 civilians arrested. 
  The security strategy that was decided upon during Maj. Gen. 
Hasan al-Alfi's term calls for gradual escalation by expanding 
the area of confrontation with all terrorist elements, in order 
to abort terrorism, pluck out its roots, and liquidate all the 
elements of impetus that stand behind it, supporting it, and 
financing it both at home and abroad. I have enumerated the 
forms of confrontation with certain of their basic features: 

  -  Contacts with a large number of world nations to hand over 
persons against whom sentences for terrorist acts have been 
issued. The latest measure in this regard was the signing of a 
security agreement with Pakistan, during the visit of the 
Pakistani minister of justice to Cairo two weeks ago. This 
agreement stipulates the handing over of Afghan Egyptians who 
are still in Peshawar, or in any Pakistan city. This has also 
been done with several other countries. Egypt intends to broach 
the issue of international cooperation to end terrorism at the 
Interpol Conference, which will be held in Turkey soon. 
  -  Revealing the ugly face of terrorism by presenting former 
terrorists to declare their repentance to public opinion via the 
media. This experiment was successful with one of the 
"al-Shuqiyin" group, 'Adil 'Abd-al-Mun'im. There are others that 
could be presented, including women, such as the wife of the 
terrorist Tharwat Hajjaj, who was killed in a battle with police 
several weeks ago. 
  -  Adopting the principle of taking the initiative against and 
aborting terrorism, by means of modernizing and updating data 
pertaining to terrorist organizations and supplying the police 
with the most modern arms and equipment, to enable them to 
combat terrorists. 
  -  Allowing opportunities for repentance to those from terrorist 
organizations who wish to do so, especially in the towns of 
Upper Egypt, and solve any problems that they face, either in 
finding them jobs or other matters, so long as the repenter was 
not convicted in terrorist operations against the police. 


    This policy has proved its worth, on the evidence of large 
numbers of repenters. In addition, certain Jihad leaders have 
backed away from their political views. One of them is Hasan 
al-Hilawi, an important and long-time leader of the Jihad 
organization, who has begun to call for self-control, an end to 
violence, to throw down weapons, and a dialogue with the 
government. He issued a fatwah to the effect that it was not 
permissible to oust the ruler or to create groups that defy 
public order. This policy has been successful to a degree that 
has caused certain lawyers representing them, especially the 
lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat, to ask for dialogue with the 
government. However, the government rejected this request, and 
Maj. Gen. Hasan al-Alfi stated, "We will not negotiate with 
killers and criminals." 
  The most recent major blow came last week, when security 
forces were able to kill Tal'at Yasin Himam, leader of the 
Islamic Group's military wing, who led the operation that 
resulted in the death of Maj. Gen. Ra'uf Khayat. Himam died in a 
battle with security forces in the Hada'iq al-Qubbah district. 
  The security apparatus considered Himam a most dangerous 
terrorist and had sentenced him to death in absentia in the 
Afghan case. That proves the security forces' success in 
penetrating terrorist organizations, since they learned Himam's 
hiding place and the whereabouts of the headquarters for 
organization meetings.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salamah: "Plan to Control </F>
Shantytowns Evaluated; Two Stages of Development Completed in 11 
Governorates; Further Shantytown Development Requires 3.5 
Billion Pounds in Total Allocations"] 
  [Text] With the completion of the third stage of shantytown 
action in the various governorates, it would be useful to pause 
in order to evaluate the plan to control shantytowns and 
determine whether it has been successful. How well did the 
governorates implement their shantytown control plans? What 
difficulties did they encounter? 
  Shantytowns are largely found in 11 Egyptian governorates 
but 
are at a maximum concentration in Cairo, Giza, al-Qalyubiyah, 
and Alexandria. There are 434 shantytowns throughout the 
governorates. They need 3.485 billion pounds even though 290 
million pounds was expended on the first stage of improvements 
and enhancements. The second stage has been allocated an 
additional 183.9 million pounds in the current fiscal year 
  Cairo accounted for the lion's share of total expended 
allocations. Expenditures on the first stage alone amounted to 
10 million pounds in addition to 50 million pounds in the 
current fiscal year. 
<H5>  84 Percent </H5>
  The Ministry of Local Administration conducted a performance 
evaluation of the first stage of the shantytown action plan in 
order to improve the efficacy of subsequent stages of 
development and to overcome obstacles encountered in removing 
the shantytowns. 
  The focus of the Cairo governorate in the first stage was on 
zones fraught with tension, specifically al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' 
and 'Ayn Shams. The first stage of allocations of 10 million 
pounds were spent on sewers and street paving. 
  In 'Ayn Shams, 13 streets were paved and the water system 
was 
improved. Needed cleaning and beautification equipment was also 
purchased. 
  Al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' had its main streets and lanes paved, 
its sewer system completed, and its water system overhauled. In 
addition, cleaning equipment was purchased and al-Zawiyah 
al-Hamra' hospital was refurbished. 
  The first stage of shantytown development in Cairo 
accomplished 84 percent of its goals and expended 8.4 million 
pounds of its total allocation. 
<H5>  Self-Help </H5>
  Al-Qalyubiyah, according to a Ministry of Local 
Administration report, achieved 100 percent of planned 
objectives and expended all its development allocations on 
street paving, sanitary sewers, and potable water systems in its 
various towns. 
  Al-Qalyubiyah began shantytown development on its own, 
according to its governor Dr. 'Adil Ilhami, by allocating 10 
million pounds of its local resources to deal with the problem, 
resolve the predicament of shantytown residents by providing 
them with alternative housing, and develop existing shantytowns 
in 'Izbat-al-Zira'ah, Manshiyat-al-Nur, Tarrad al-Nil, and 
Shubrah-al-Khaymah. After the shantytowns were surveyed and a 
plan devised for their development, they were allocated a 
two-tier allotment of 27.5 million pounds supplemented by an 
additional allocation of 4.5 million pounds under the 
governorate's emergency plan to initiate shantytown control--a 
plan approved by the Ministry of Local Administration. 
  The governor pointed out that the emergency plan was fully 
implemented in all the shantytowns of its various towns, but 
that still to be completed is the governorate's comprehensive 
plan, once the shantytowns are surveyed and their needs for 
projects and services ascertained. This comprehensive plan is to 
cost about 279 million pounds for school and hospital 
construction, street paving, sewer systems, electric grid 
projects, and other basic services in the deprived areas. 
  The governor explained that it will take 18 additional 
shantytown schools to solve the three-shift problem in certain 
areas. More police stations and youth centers also need to be 
built, he added. 
  Ten million pounds were allocated for the first stage of 
shantytown development in Alexandria governorate, of which 86 
percent, or 8.645 million pounds, has been actually spent on 
development. 
  Shantytown development in Alexandria targeted street paving 
and sewer projects. Five million pounds ware spent on paving and 
the remaining 3.645 million pounds went to sanitary sewer 
projects. 
<H5>  Before the Assembly </H5>
  The Housing Committee of the People's Assembly, in order to 
field monitor shantytown development, visited some of the 
governorates afflicted with shantytowns in order to evaluate the 
progress of the work in the field, ascertain the objectives 
accomplished, and prepare for the Assembly a special report on 
the government's shantytown development plan, according to 
Housing Committee chairman al-Sayyid Sarhan. 
  The Committee noted that shantytowns continue to spring up 
and grow, laying to waste all efforts expended on that problem. 
This is attributed to development-stunting "bureaucracies" in 
the governorates, lofty fees and costs for approved land 
divisions, and the failure of certain towns over 60 or more 
years to modify their perimeters in accordance with their 
natural expansion. 
  The Committee chairman emphasized that new housing divisions 
should take the form of urban communities in the sense that they 
should be complete with the basic services that their residents 
need, such as schools, hospitals, and police and fire stations. 
Only when such facilities are planned should a division be 
approved and issued its permit by the authorities. 
  It is also necessary, he added, to protect state-owned land 
from squatters in order to ward off the formation of new 
shantytowns. State-owned land should be used for building 
planned urban housing communities that would be self-sufficient 
in public services and utilities. 
<H5>  Support by the State </H5>
  He said: "It is mandatory for the state to prevent the 
formation of any more shantytowns. It is obvious that those 
communities sprang-up under the noses of various state agencies 
which lacked the wherewithal to do something about them. It is 
important to ward off future shantytown formation by supporting 
local governments and other agencies that could play a role in 
challenging them." 
  I asked him: "How about the shantytowns that must be 
removed?" 
  He answered: "The Committee visited a few of those. They 
will 
never respond to development and improvement efforts and need to 
be totally removed. However, we must first provide their 
residents with alternate housing. We may be able to accommodate 
them in vacant housing units in new communities and build them 
integrated communities there. 
  "Land reclaimed from shantytowns could be incorporated in 
local city planning and utilized in accordance with city needs 
in a manner that would prevent them from supporting shantytowns 
again." 
  The Housing Committee concluded in its report that local 
governments and the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources 
should coordinate with each other in order to prevent the 
formation of new shantytowns in susceptible locations such as 
canal and river banks, under bridge superstructures, and along 
major roads. The Committee also underscored the value of 
reducing costs and easing permit requirements for new land 
developments as part of orderly urban development in the cities. 
<H5>  An End to Shantytowns </H5>
  Dr. Mahmud Sharif, Minister of Local Administration, 
believes 
that rural areas must be developed and helped to grow in order 
to ward off the formation of new shantytowns by containing 
outward migration. He also believes that planning should 
out-pace shantytowns by developing new plots suitable for 
residential use and selling them to individuals and 
cooperatives, and by coming down hard on building code, zoning, 
and city planning violations. There must be coordination in that 
regard between local governments and various agencies of the 
Ministry in order to quickly spot the violations and remove them. 
  He pointed out that the Ministry has set priorities in 
approaching the problem since it would be difficult to deal all 
at once with all shantytowns throughout the governorates. 
Topping the list of priorities are Greater Cairo and Alexandria 
as well as nine other governorates in Upper Egypt. Shantytowns 
in the 11 governorates have been surveyed and the cost of their 
development estimated at 3.48 billion pounds. The governorates 
have proffered projects that are already planned and therefore 
could be tendered in two months. Outlays of 106 million pounds 
have been allocated for this stage and the governorates have 
selected projects that could be completed during the current 
fiscal year. This puts shantytown development allocations at 290 
million pounds so far. 
  Requests from the governorates for the cleaning equipment 
they need are being received and reconciled as to costs and 
specifications. This equipment, estimated to cost 162 million 
pounds, will be supplied in two stages. Equipment supplied in 
the first stage will cost 51.9 million pounds. 
<H5>  Grassroots Solutions </H5>
  Minister Mahmud Sharif emphasized that only with grassroots 
participation can the shantytown problem be resolved once and 
for all. He cites the good example of al-Nahdah City which 
absorbed a large number of quake and shantytown victims and 
where The Red Crescent Society implemented a specific plan to 
involve inhabitants in the management of their city. Each 
apartment building elects one of its tenants to represent it, 
and five such representatives are elected to represent all 
residents on the city's administrative council. This indicates 
that it is possible to modify citizen behavior and to implant 
the values of respect for public property and interest in the 
environment as well as develop neighborliness and the spirit of 
belonging. 
  Several agencies helped with that plan in cooperation with 
UNICEF. Preliminary results are very encouraging. 
  The Ministry is reinforcing that experiment by introducing a 
new plan to help alleviate unemployment in that society by 
training youths in the various trades and giving them preference 
in obtaining small business financing from the Social Fund and 
others.

<F P=106> [Article by Ayman al-Mahdi: "Story of the Dish in Egypt"] </F>
  [Text] While Damietta Governorate cars were cruising the 
streets asking citizens not to use direct-reception antennas 
("the dish") to receive foreign television programs, Cairo's 
Muhandisin district was witnessing the publication of a special 
magazine carrying the schedules for satellite dish channels. The 
magazine's owners (a businessman and his wife) listed the times 
of programs that their children and those of the neighbors could 
see. They decided not to announce other programs that were 
forbidden. 
  The magazine was intended to be an alternative solution 
making it finally unnecessary to ask the businessman and his 
wife for an opinion about the dish. 
  The satellite dish has become a phenomenon and a power 
statement from its microphones--magazines are published for 
similar objectives. Now that its merchandize, alien to the taste 
and values of our community, is in demand, a period of vigorous 
debate has begun between two groups--one of them for the dish, 
the other against it. 
  Amid these noisy discussions, Dr. Inshirah al-Shal of Cairo 
University's Faculty of Information, was preparing Egypt's first 
scientific field study of the reasons for owning a dish antenna, 
the effect that interest in watching its programs was having on 
the following of Egyptian television programs and the viewing of 
videotaped materials, and the 173-case sample's conviction about 
spreading the idea of watching programs from abroad after their 
having undergone this experience. 
  In the early eighties the first bowl-shaped antenna ("dish") 
appeared in the Cairo skies--in Garden City, to be exact--to 
carry news messages at the American Embassy. Antennas began to 
spread afterward on the roofs of buildings. 
  Although the dish made its first appearance in the world at 
the beginning of the sixties, it entered Egypt at the citizen 
level only nine years ago. It used to be smuggled through the 
airports and ports disassembled, until its importation became 
legal--provided that the diameter of the dish does not exceed 
2.4 meters. Artists, businessmen, major personalities, and 
foreign communities became its most prominent customers. Despite 
its high price during this period (about $30,000), the 
large-diameter American product dominated the market. 
  During the eighties there were only three agencies in Egypt 
importing the dish, including the Egypt Company for Free 
Markets. The number of importers had jumped to 59 by the 
beginning of 1992. The figure rose markedly at the beginning of 
1993. Sources of the antennas became numerous, and the price 
fell after moderately-priced antennas affordable to the ordinary 
citizen were offered. The Egyptian product entered the scene 
through factory antennas and investment company antennas. 
<H5>  Authority in the Home </H5>
  "Tell me what you watch, and I will tell you who you are." 
  Dr. Inshirah al-Shal relied on this maxim in her study. For 
the study she designed a questionnaire form for viewers of 
overseas channels. Then she assembled the information in Cairo. 
Her most important finding was the high ratio of males to 
females in the study sample--about 5:2, or 71 percent to 29 
percent. This means that authority in the Egyptian home still is 
in the hands of the father, husband, or son--though one should 
not overlook the content of some incoming programs whose 
audience may be limited to males, rather than females in 
Egyptian families. 
  A difference in ages among members of the sample was also 
observed; however, the ages of the majority (60 percent of the 
sample) ranged between 19 and 40. This means that receiving 
overseas programs by satellite dish is widespread in age groups 
most of which qualify as youthful. 
<H5>  Diploma Holders, Married People </H5>
  The study also indicated that when the data for the sample 
were examined for educational level, one noted that about 75 
percent of the individuals had obtained a university diploma 
(bachelor of arts or of science). Some had obtained a master's 
or doctorate. Cases that were below the bachelor's level in the 
study sample amounted to 16 percent, and they were students. 
  It turned out that 57 percent of the sample were married and 
34 percent unmarried. One could also see that most of the 
individuals in the sample had excellent or good English (86 
percent). Knowledge of French ran a distant second (39 percent). 
This means, according to Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, that the ability 
to follow programs from overseas and understand their content 
depends on the language in which these programs are created. 
This is true for the time being, but it will soon be possible 
for the audience to choose the language in which it wants to 
receive and view these programs. 
  The study indicated that Muhandisin, Madinat Nasr, and 
Heliopolis were the areas with the most satellite dishes. 
Al-Muqattam, al-Manyal, and Hulwan came at the bottom of the 
list. 
  The study showed that businessmen (28 percent) were most 
numerous among dish owners. Government employees (25 percent) 
were in second place. The ratio of government employees to 
professionals was about 2:1. This result indicates that 
satellite dish ownership depends on economic and educational 
level. 
  The study recorded the phenomenon of several families in a 
building or limited area sharing one central satellite dish. 
<H5>  Neighbors the Reason </H5>
  The study was not without its novel side. One group in the 
sample (7 percent) reported that the reason for their owning the 
dish had to do with the neighbors. Five percent said it was 
friends, while 64 percent said it was a husband or father. 
  As for the real reasons for obtaining the dish, the survey 
showed that 26 percent of the individuals surveyed wanted to 
know what is happening abroad. This applied particularly to 
members of the political corps and big businessmen. About 24 
percent wanted to see good programs. Some individuals from the 
latter group said they were tired of Egyptian television, which 
has become very poor and very local and does not even broadcast 
programs at their announced times. One individual said he wanted 
to know what was going on abroad and at home as soon as it 
happened. 
  A group in the sample reported that they had bought the dish 
because it was a new entertainment device for adults and 
children alike. 
  Accordingly, one can summarize the reasons for owning a 
satellite dish under two headings: first, because it is a piece 
of modern technology and (as one of the members of the sample 
said) one should not deprive one's family of something new. 
Thirty-one percent of the sample agreed. 
  The second reason has to do with content. As a group of 
sampled individuals said, it was "to watch programs that the 
censorship will not allow in Egypt," or "to continue watching 
programs they became accustomed to watching while abroad," or 
"to know what is happening abroad," or "to improve one's 
knowledge of a foreign language," or "as an alternative to 
boring Egyptian television." Sixty-nine percent of the 
individuals in the sample cited such reasons. 
<H5>  Chance for Improvement </H5>
  Although, as Dr. Inshirah al-Shal says, this result is 
clear, 
it gives the impression that there still is a chance for 
Egyptian television to assert its presence by improving the 
level of its programs so that the rug is not pulled out from 
under it irrevocably. 
  It was therefore necessary to ask: To what extent were 
people 
satisfied with the dish after a period of contact and experience 
with it? 
  The result was that 45 percent were very satisfied and would 
encourage its spread; 22 percent were very satisfied, but would 
not encourage its spread; 28 percent were somewhat satisfied; 3 
percent were dissatisfied personally; about 7 percent were 
dissatisfied and would oppose its entry into the Egyptian home; 
and about 2 percent did not respond. 
  It was also necessary to determine the relation between 
watching oversees programs by satellite dish and watching 
Egyptian television programs. The result was that 59 percent of 
the individuals in the study sample watch Egyptian television. 
Thirty-seven percent responded "sometimes." About 2 percent do 
not watch it, and 2 percent did not respond. 
  As for the amount of Egyptian television viewed by satellite 
dish owners, the study showed that 19 percent of them watch it 
only rarely; 12 percent watch it less than an hour a day; 25 
percent watch it from one to two hours; and 29 percent watch it 
from two to three hours. 
<H5>  Superchannel--Number 1 </H5>
  There were several surprises in the order of overseas 
channels favored by Egyptian viewers who own a satellite dish. 
The British Superchannel occupied the top of the list. Next came 
CNN, but with the Superchannel leading 3 to 1. Then came 
Euronews, the European news channel that began broadcasting at 
the end of 1992 to maintain a balance after CNN began sweeping 
the world's television screens during the Gulf war. 
  The French, Italian, Israeli, German, and Spanish channels 
came next. The Turkish channel was in sixth place, before the 
German channel and after the Israeli channel. The Arab channels 
came in eighth place. The sample members set the MBC [Middle 
East Broadcasting Center] channels in first place, followed by 
the Egyptian Space Channel, then the Tunisian, Moroccan, 
Emirate, Saudi, and Dubayy channels. 
  These channels have influenced the viewing of videotapes by 
members of the sample. While 20 percent are keen on watching 
them, and 50 percent said they sometimes watched them, 20 
percent of the members of the sample do not watch them at all. 
Their reasons can be summed up as lack of time, preference for 
watching television programs from other countries, or lack of 
interest. 
<H5>  Most Important Points </H5>
  The most important point the study raised was the 
acknowledgment by 80 percent of the members of the sample that 
watching satellite dish channels indeed influences the viewing 
of Egyptian television. Seventeen percent denied any influence. 
  An important question arises: Is there a negative relation 
between openness to the world--interest in watching others' 
programs--and interest in our domestic problems? 
  Dr. Inshirah al-Shal, professor in Cairo University's 
Faculty 
of Information, a specialist in literature and the humanities, 
says that the question needs to be studied more deeply. Foreign 
television programs have created so-called "world stars" on the 
political and artistic level; they could also--herein lies the 
danger--create "the international child." This is what leads us 
to demand that thorough studies be made to research the effects 
of watching programs coming to Egyptian television screens from 
abroad by various means. From such programs may come a desire to 
emigrate, apathy, a feeling of alienation, or enlistment under 
the banner of groups alien to the values, customs, and 
traditions of the community. 
  We too ask for interest in such a study, for more such 
studies, and for implementation of their recommendations before 
it is too late.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Ismat al-Hawari, lawyer: "There Is No Good in a </F>
Nation Whose Judiciary's Independence Is Not Safeguarded"] 
  [Text] It is a sufficient honor, glory, and tribute for the 
judicial authority that God's Messenger [Muhammad]--may God 
bless him and grant him peace--was the first judge in Islam. 
Likewise, it is a sufficient rank and exaltedness for that 
authority that the Creator, who is praised and exalted, set 
judgeship in the place following prophethood. 
  Thus He says--may He be exalted [Koran 2:213]: "The people 
were one nation; then God sent forth the Prophets, good tidings 
to bear and warning, and He sent down with them the Book with 
the truth, that He might decide between the people touching 
their differences." He who is exalted has also said [Koran 
38:26]: "David, behold, We have appointed thee a viceroy in the 
earth; therefore judge between men justly, and follow not 
caprice." What greater and loftier tribute to the judicial 
authority could there be than that the Creator should set it in 
a place of elevation and dignity, so that "Just" became one of 
the God's Names most beautiful? 
  I should not be overstepping the fact or offending against 
the truth if I affirmed and averred that the independence of the 
judicial authority is the sole guarantee that ensures the 
citizen the justice he seeks, and that through the neutrality 
and independence of that authority justice is upheld. If affairs 
of state are managed with justice, the state stands and is 
upright; but if justice is not maintained in the state, the 
state endures pains and perishes. Impairment of the judicial 
authority's independence is impairment of the state's 
sovereignty that should prevail. 
  This is a true saying for Egypt and for history. I swear 
that 
it is free of any admixture of hypocrisy or flattery; for we 
have no remnant of life left to play the hypocrite with any 
creature, however mighty his authority and great his respect. We 
will hold fast to respect for God; on His strength alone we call 
for help, and to none but Him do our heads and faces bow. It is 
a true saying that we all must repeat and affirm, that the 
judicial authority is the country's inviolable honor. All of us, 
rulers and ruled, therefore have an obligation to bring about 
its full and unimpeded independence, so that its agents can 
perform their duty without fear of tyrant's sword, shunning the 
wealth of a ruler as wealthy as al-Mu'izz and the most tempting 
of gifts. This will never come to pass except by freeing the 
[judicial] authority from subordination to any other authority. 
  A state that does not preserve the independence of its 
judicial authority is a state that refuses to uphold justice and 
makes coercion, force, and tyranny the way of governing. You 
will find that such a state has lost its way; and having lost 
its way, it will not bring dignity to its people, because the 
dignity of the people comes from the dignity of the judicial 
authority. There is no good in a nation where the independence 
of the judiciary is not safeguarded. 
  There is nothing more dangerous for a people's ethics and 
culture than for the executive authority to interfere in matters 
of justice or for that authority to impose its tutelage over the 
judicial authority, so that it impairs the judiciary's 
independence. The judiciary then becomes subordinate to 
something else, not to its own conscience. Only the agents of 
the judiciary, without supervision from any other authority, can 
administer and uphold justice. We must remember and never forget 
that when the calamitous massacre of the judiciary took place, 
it shook the independence of the judiciary. The massacre was 
really a massacre of the people's rights and freedoms. When the 
executioners subdued the independence of the judiciary and sent 
the law on vacation, dens of oppression and power centers arose. 
Vipers rushed forth to usurp power and assume guardianship over 
people's livelihoods and resources. They built a spurious empire 
of Satanic usurpation. They allowed themselves to commit every 
forbidden act. They froze the people into feudal structures. 
They created legions of proteges and political adolescents. We 
must realize and ponder how when the judiciary lost its 
independence, the people lost their freedom. When the people 
lost their freedom, proud Egypt lost every war it entered 
against its enemies. Thus when judicial independence does not 
exist, it is an enormous wrong against the judiciary itself. 
Indeed, it is a shameful wrong on the part of whoever impairs 
that independence. Wrong leads only to wrong; bats multiply in 
the darkness. Thus there is no room for freedom without the 
independence of the judiciary: for the citizen's freedom comes 
from the freedom and independence of his judge. We have already 
discussed in previous articles how it would be a matter of 
justice to abolish the Ministry of Justice. That ministry must 
disappear. Its continued existence is an impairment of the 
judicial authority's independence. It is the imposition of a 
hateful tutelage that the executive authority spreads over the 
judicial authority. 
  The time has come for us to call on President Mubarak for 
help--he who is calling for the building of an Egypt of justice 
and purity, that it may be recorded in the pages of his 
administration's history that there was no tutelage over the 
judicial authority, no interference by the executive authority 
in the administration of justice, and no impairment of the 
judiciary's independence. No to the existence of the Ministry of 
Justice! Yes--a thousand times yes--to the Higher Judicial 
Council, the legitimate father of the agents of the judicial 
authority and to every matter related to justice in Egypt!

<F P=106> [Article by Majid 'Atiyyah] </F>
  [Text] The Egyptian delegation, which included Drs. Kamal 
al-Janzuri, 'Atif 'Ubayd, and Yusif Butrus Ghali, has returned 
from extensive negotiations with the World Bank, the IMF, the 
U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Agency for 
International Development (USAID). 
  Discussions naturally revolved around the "paper" drafted at 
the end of last March by Egyptian and World Bank experts and 
signed for Egypt by Dr. Yusif Butrus Ghali and for the World 
Bank by Ram Shapra, head of its Middle East Department. 
  The "paper" is the outcome of an evaluation of the [current] 
structural reforms. The reforms are undertaken in the context of 
the second stage of the Economic Reform Program and the 
Structural Adjustment Program, and the reforms involve the areas 
of finance, privatization, and the timetable for implementation. 
  The "paper" contains three major elements--the positive 
results of the economic reforms program in light of agreed 
recommendations; defining the issues that should have been 
already resolved but remain pending; and the actions to be taken 
by the government this year and through July 1995 when the 
program expires. 
  As far as the overall economy is concerned, the "paper" 
reports that implementation proceeded as planned and achieved 
tangible results in all aspects of performance and standards 
through the end of 1993. 
  The government committed to continue planned fiscal measures 
intended to reduce the budget deficit to 2.6 percent of GDP by 
the end of June 1994, and to narrow it even further in the 
1994/95 budget. 
  The government committed to bringing down the rate of 
inflation from 15 percent in 1992/93 to 7.4 percent by January 
1994. 
  The $900 million balance of payments surplus realized in the 
first six months of the year came close to the $2 billion target 
for the year. 
  The report also states that the current account deficit has 
been reduced at a faster rate than planned. That deficit 
currently stands at 1.3 percent of GDP. 
  The Uniform Tax Law has been promulgated in the hopes of 
improving current budget revenues. The law prevents the 
double-taxation of corporations and economic activity. It also 
reduces the burden of those of limited means. 
  Trimming government subsidies helped contain the growth in 
public spending and in wages as well as stabilize investments at 
the targeted level of 7 percent of GDP. The ceiling for 
expenditures has been set at 7.2 percent of GDP. 
  The government has acceded to World Bank recommendations to 
limit public sector investments to infrastructure projects and 
leave other investments to the private sector. 
  Egypt must continue to channel credit to the private sector 
and to lower interest rates. The latter have indeed dropped in 
the second half of last year from 15 to 13.4 percent, thereby 
reducing inflationary pressures. 
  Exchange rates stabilized at about 3.39 pounds per dollar 
despite inflows of currencies and remittances. Intervention by 
the Central Bank helped set that rate. 
  The government reduced customs duties to a maximum of 70 
percent. Other tariffs in the 30 to 40 percent range have been 
reduced by 10 percent as previously agreed in the program. 
Duties on capital goods have also been reduced from 10 to five 
percent. 
  As a result of government discussions with World Bank 
experts, a GATT consultant was named to help the government 
"purge the legislative climate" of anti-dumping policies and to 
put safe and secure mechanisms in place. 
  It has also been agreed that the government will introduce 
into the People's Assembly a bill that would allow foreign 
companies to engage in foreign trade side by side with domestic 
export/import firms. The draft-law would abolish all remaining 
restrictions on private sector trade in cotton and would allow 
non-Egyptians to engage in the cotton trade on par with 
Egyptians. It would also allow foreign banks to open on-shore 
branches and would encourage competition by allowing insurance 
companies to operate within the country. 
  It was agreed as well on the need to expedite the 
introduction into the People's Assembly of a rental housing bill 
that would abolish all rent controls on new or vacated housing 
units. 
  The discussions also touched on the need to lift all 
restrictions on industrial investments such as eliminating the 
need to obtain permits from the Investment Authority or the 
Industrialization Authority in order to construct factories in 
new communities. The Bank's delegation commended the decision to 
abolish the prior sanction requirement for investments of 5 
million pounds or less. That ceiling has been raised to 10 
billion pounds under the decree issued by President Mubarak on 
labor day. 
  Also discussed was the underwriting of privatization costs 
by 
the general state budget or through the resources of the 
companies being privatized or restructured. 
  Even though the World Bank gave satisfactory performance 
evaluations to public sector companies, a list was made of 35 
companies that were due for divestiture under the 1992/93 
program but will be privatized under the 1993/94 program instead. 
  Discussions also dealt with the delayed "liquidation" of 
certain companies, because the government supplanted them by 
other companies with a book value of 475 million Egyptian 
pounds, even though only 355 million pounds in liquidations were 
actually realized by the end of 1993. 
  Still on the subject of privatization, the delegation 
commends the existence of a full-time cabinet portfolio 
dedicated to the public business sector. The ministry implements 
programs to encourage worker participation in privatization 
programs through more than 50 investor/worker federations. Many 
privatized company shares have also been made available on the 
stock exchange. 
  The discussions also dealt with reforming the banking sector 
and with reducing the Central Bank's foreign exchange reserves 
requirement from 15 to 10 percent of each bank's aggregate 
earnings redeposited interest-free with the Central Bank. The 
talks touched on whether banks meet the capital requirements set 
by the Basel Committee and on whether they allocate adequate 
reserves to cover non-performing loans. World Bank experts 
commended the implementation of the agreement to sell public 
bank equities in banks and private firms, otherwise known as 
joint banks or joint investment companies. 
  In a different area, the discussions focused on the delayed 
implementation of certain aspects of agreed programs such as 
boosting the GDP rate of growth which remains weak in certain 
instances, causing unemployment to rise to 17 percent. 
  Other shortcomings in program implementation that were 
discussed included: 

  -  People's Assembly failure to impose a 5-percent tax on 
savings earnings. 
  -  The imposition by the government of a 2-percent customs duty 
over and above the current fee which is 1-percent higher than 
the customs duties set by recent customs conventions. 
  -  The consumer price of electricity remains at 80 percent of 
marginal cost when the government had promised to implement 
higher rates. 
  -  The entry of foreigners in the cotton market remains 
restricted, in that cotton trade is restricted by law to 
Egyptian nationals. The World Bank delegation criticized the 
government for setting a minimum selling price for an interim 
period that is yet to be defined. 
  -  World Bank experts would rather do without certain investment 
formalities in the governorates. Examples are defining areas 
suitable for investments and issuing local government permits. 
  -  World Bank experts criticized the manner of privatizing the 
insurance and Social Security sectors by not factoring in 
options for reforms in social security, especially in view of 
the propensity to combine the Insurance, Social Security, and 
Pension departments. 

  It was agreed to expedite the introduction into the People's 
Assembly of the new insurance bill, which would allow foreign 
firms to operate within the country and would provide for 
monitoring "private funds" in order to raise their investment 
standards. At this point, the World Bank criticized the 
government for seizing insurance surpluses, amounting so far to 
33 billion pounds, and for the low interest rate it pays on them. 
  The talks established goals for 1994, including the 
completion of a study to set up an autonomous organizational 
structure for utilities. 
  They also stressed the need to sell more shares of banks in 
which public sector banks have equity ownership; to encourage 
the formation of employee associations to help workers obtain 
bank loans to acquire shares; and to expedite the drafting of a 
uniform law on corporations and economic activity which would 
govern such eventualities as bankruptcies, anti-trust cases, 
mergers, and arbitration. The World Bank expressed willingness 
to help get this bill drafted before the current session of the 
People's Assembly adjourns. 
  The Bank also emphasized the need to eliminate Ministry of 
Supply sugar and cooking oil subsidies by the end of 1995; to 
fully liberalize the cotton trade by the end of 1995; and to 
liberalize housing rents by the end of this year. 
  It was also learned that those recommendations on the course 
of economic reforms notwithstanding, both World Bank and IMF 
presidents commended the rate of Egyptian reforms, which 
exceeded expectations. The government, meanwhile, has been keen 
on facing up to the expected negative aspects of the reforms 
program by paying careful attention to its social consequences 
in order to safeguard the livelihood of those with limited 
incomes. 
  Even though the Bank and the IMF have both recommended that 
wages be contained, the government has approved auxiliary wage 
increases year after year in order to safeguard worker quality 
of life. It has also continued to subsidize most basic 
commodities and such public services as education and health and 
to make financial contributions to pensions and social insurance.

<F P=106> [Article by Hani Salih: "Workers Do Not Know"] </F>
  [Text] New phrases have invaded workers' lives. They now 
have to deal with words heard for the first time, such as 
privatization, stocks, employee unions, etc. 
  Citizen understanding and conviction about any new phrase or 
situation is undoubtedly the first guarantee of the experiment's 
success. In the past the experiment of the private sector 
suffered from lack of comprehension by many. 
  How are employees now receiving these terms that are new to 
their lives? How are they dealing with them? Have they indeed 
understood them? Has anyone attempted to explain them to them? 
  'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il (age 54), senior overseer, said he 
had 
heard much about the business sector laws, but understood 
nothing about them. 
  "The company has voluntarily begun deducting part of the 
price of shares, but we are asking whether it is for our benefit 
and what their system is." 
  Answering himself, he said: "The trade union committees and 
company officials should have explained to employees the 
importance of buying these shares and what guarantees will be 
provided to workers, because the employees feel afraid of 
privatization, and the union committee has no part in the 
matter." 
  He said that he nevertheless approved of buying shares, but 
that it ought to be done from conviction. 
<H5>  Trading Workers' Shares </H5>
  Yusri 'Abd-al-'Aziz, senior overseer, asked: "Can an 
employee-purchased share be traded on the stock exchange? Has 
the share been registered in my name or not? An employee ought 
to be allowed to sell and buy, so that he feels the real benefit 
of owning the share. The rules and regulations for stock 
ownership ought to be announced among employees." 
  He warns about a new buyer's pressuring workers in order to 
buy their shares when they take ownership of the company. He 
also asks what rate of return these stocks will have. These 
things should be completely clear to the employees. 
<H5>  Decision To Invest--Whose Responsibility? </H5>
  Hamsah 'Abd-al-Mun'im Kilani, female employee of the Egypt 
Oils Company, said: "A share means a new kind of security. 
Employee investment in stock purchasing ought to be voluntary 
and not compulsory, because the owner of capital has the right 
to decide freely whether to invest by buying shares within the 
company, outside it, or through the stock market." 
  She asked: "When we think of recouping the price of the 
share, can its value be converted immediately? At what price? Or 
shall we be told to wait until the end of the fiscal year?" 
  Hanan al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Khaliq, a female employee, said that 
privatization was a word frequently used in recent years, but 
she did not know its meaning. However, she believes that the 
employee ought to own part of the shares of the company in which 
he works. This will strengthen loyalty and affiliation. Workers 
should be able to understand the terms of negotiation with new 
buyers. 
<H5>  Things Not Understood </H5>
  Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud, a member of the elected board of 
directors of al-Nasr Automobile Company, said that a union of 
shareholding workers has been formed and announced. Government 
policy is to give workers ownership of a portion of the stock of 
the company in which they work. Offering a company for sale has 
not received sufficient explanation; the majority of workers do 
not understand it. It was recently announced that a company 
could be sold by a number of means--sale by the administration, 
by stock purchase, or lease to utilize capacities. 
  He said these matters were not understood and unclear 
because 
there was a lack of information. Although it was government 
policy and a shift from a directed system to a free economy, 
workers must participate in this stage. 
  He declared that he as a worker did not object to the 
company's new buyer. "But we ought to be informed about these 
proceedings and their reason from the opening of bidding until 
the sale is closed. The length of the selling process causes 
anxiety for the workers and affects the company's contract 
commitments with buyers of goods or importers of components." 
  He said that any new buyer must not reduce workers' wages 
and 
incentives. He must fully utilize productive capacity and employ 
the work force without neglecting it. 
  Workers must be represented in the negotiating procedures as 
an observer to guarantee their rights. 
<H5>  Interest, Rights </H5>
  Nasir Kamil Sulayman, decoration technician in the planning 
division of al-Nasr Automobiles, asked whether purchasing stocks 
would benefit the workers, and why the worker did not represent 
himself when buying the stock. 
  He said that it was the first time he had heard about the 
shareholders' union. Worker stock ownership would safeguard 
their rights in the face of buyers and strengthen the sense of 
affiliation, but these things had to take place with full 
conviction and complete clarity. 
  'Ali Sa'id Gharib, senior overseer at the bus factory, said 
that an employee's salary would not permit him to buy any 
shares, even though ownership of company stock was necessary to 
strengthen the employee's sense of affiliation with the factory. 
  He said that he understood nothing the media was publishing 
about privatization. He asked whether it was some state secret. 
  He said that the company had 10,000 employees, although no 
more than 3,000 were supposed to be working in it. The employees 
were not against discharging part of the work force, provided 
they were compensated appropriately and that it was clearly 
announced instead of being covered up. 
  'Abd-al-Wahhab Mubarak said that one should not announce 
policies that were not implemented. For example, it was 
announced that vacations and foreign travel were being granted 
to government employees, while at the same time some companies 
were refusing to renew these vacations. 
  He asked why there was this contradiction and whose interest 
it served. 
  Al-Husayni Muhammadi Mansur, secretary of the Union of 
Worker 
Shareholders at the Coca Cola Company said that workers had 
recently realized the importance of forming the union to 
confront the new buyers. They had deducted 3.8 months from their 
dividends and 100 pounds from their savings for the purpose of 
buying shares. 
  He asked whether the Union of Worker Shareholders would have 
a voice in the board of directors proportional to the shares 
they had obtained. 
  Sa'id Fathi, the trade union committee's representative on 
the Coca Cola board of directors, said that the holding company 
ought to sell shares to the employees immediately, regardless of 
the new purchasers. Selling to Egyptians is better than to 
foreigners, and the company's selling shares is better than 
selling them by auction. 
  He explained that the trade union committees at the 
company's 
factories had been educating workers about the need for cohesion 
and for regarding the company's interest as above any personal 
consideration. Workers must realize the importance of the coming 
period. They will have to change their behavior and increase 
production, as is happening in private sector factories, so that 
the new buyers find no opportunity to lay off any worker after 
the period stipulated for no layoffs. 
<H5>  Full Responsibility </H5>
  Engineer Mamduh 'Abd-al-Halim al-Sharqawi, head of the Turah 
factories division of the Starch and Glucose Company, said that 
the operating style was different in the business sector from 
what it was under the public sector law--through better 
monitoring of production expenses and greater decisionmaking 
responsibility for factory leaders, along with full 
responsibility and greater ability to compete with imports. 
<H5>  Never Heard of Shareholders' Union </H5>
  Muhammad Shibl, a member of the trade union committee at the 
Starch and Glucose Company, said: "We never heard about the 
union of worker shareholders until after the [company's] general 
meeting decided to deduct two months of dividends [paid to 
workers] for the purpose of buying shares and promised to 
subsidize the price of the shares by two similar months." 
  He said that worker purchase of shares in this manner was 
encouraging, because the return on shares in profitable 
companies was higher than interest in banks. 
  He said that 80 percent of the workers had participated in 
shareholder development and had bought shares. 
<H5>  Sale to Foreigners Rejected </H5>
  Hijazi 'Abd-al-Rahim (age 58), senior overseer at the Starch 
Company, said he had gone to work at the company before 
nationalization, in the days of foreign owners. He indicated 
that working with foreigners was very difficult, because it 
meant no security for workers when they were sick or 
incapacitated. He therefore preferred selling to Egyptians. In 
the end they are our brothers: they love their fellow 
countrymen, and will not easily treat them carelessly. A 
diligent worker should not fear the new management; however, 
they want guarantees against dismissal.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Isma'il Shalabi, Faculty of Law, al-Zaqaziq </F>
University: "Unemployment Problem and Economic Development: 
Governors' Role"] 
  [Text] As part of the government's recent course of 
economic reform and in order to end the budget deficit and help 
eliminate unemployment, accelerate the economic development 
process, and avoid contracting more foreign debt, it is 
important to encourage the establishment of investment, 
production, and service projects in the governorates. This can 
be done by exploiting the resources of each individual 
governorate to establish such projects without the government's 
contributing any funding to them. Governors should play the main 
role in establishing these projects because of their broad 
powers, moral authority in their governorates, and good 
relations with citizens and businessmen. One can exploit the 
relative advantage that each governorate has over the others. 
Projects can be based on utilizing the citizens of each 
individual governorate in addition to whatever Arab or foreign 
capital is obtained. The performance and success of governors 
should be evaluated through the number of productive and service 
projects each has established in his governorate, the extent to 
which each has realized the policy of self-sufficiency in 
production, service, and food security, and the elimination of 
unemployment for the citizens of the governorate. I would point 
out that the best form for these projects is that of joint stock 
companies that perform productive activities in the 
manufacturing, agricultural, and service fields. Stress should 
fall on small industries that need only small capital--small 
workshops employing a limited number of university or middle 
technical school graduates. To that end I formulate in the 
following points my concept of self-reliance in investment and 
development and of how governors can contribute thereby to 
eliminating unemployment in the coming period: 
  1. The governor's role is to promote projects and work to 
establish them through his contacts, connections, and moral and 
political position. He should also arrange publicity and the 
necessary conferences for citizens and businessmen. 
  2. Participation should be limited to citizens of the region 
and the previously mentioned agencies. The Union of Egyptian 
Banks should play a promotional role with foreign and joint 
banks and thereby support these projects. 
  3. It is important that the necessary economic studies be 
done for these projects and that suitable personnel be selected 
to run them. Experienced technicians in the field of production 
of each project should be utilized. We should completely avoid 
political interference in the selection of the project, its 
site, or its workers in a way not in harmony with its economics. 
The managing boards of these companies should be formed from 
their founders and shareholders through free elections with the 
knowledge of the company's general meeting. 
  4. The following economically and socially important 
considerations should be especially taken into account with 
regard to these projects: 
  a. Increasing production and raising productivity so as to 
ensure covering the need of the domestic market for the goods 
produced, with any surplus to be exported, thereby bringing in 
foreign revenues. 
  b. The more employment in the project is restricted to 
citizens of the region, the more eager these citizens will be 
for the project's success and the more interested they will be 
in participating in it; and thus the more rapid will be the 
region's development. 
  5. The shares of these companies should be listed for 
trading 
on the stock exchange. This will invigorate the securities 
market and make it easier to create financial liquidity for 
shareholders. 
  6. The governor's success in his region is related to the 
number of joint stock companies established in the region and 
the success of these companies. He can be evaluated objectively 
on this basis.

<F P=106> [Interview with Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, attorney general </F>
of Egypt, by Suhayr al-Husayni; place and date not given: "1994 
Is the Year of the End of Troubles for Capital Investors and 
Settlement of Their Claims"--first paragraph is AKHIR SA'AH 
introduction] 
  [Text] Issue No. 1: Counselor Raja' al-'Arabi, by virtue of 
his work as a prosecutor for more than 30 years, is used to 
asking questions and exercising the authority of an 
investigator. But in this meeting I asked his permission for us 
to change roles. I brought up with him a number of important 
issues that reflect the concerns and worries of Egyptian 
citizens. The questions were bold and direct, and the replies 
were confident and definite, and they reflected the man's candor 
and clarity. It was only natural that the first matter to be 
brought up in an interview with the attorney general was the 
case involving the victims of the investment companies. 
  [Al-Husayni] The attorney Shawqi al-Sayyid received a 
judgment from the courts concerned obliging the state to give 
back the investors' capital. Why has this judgment not been 
carried out so far, and to what extent can it be carried out? 
  [Al-'Arabi] A news item really has appeared to the effect 
that one of the courts has issued a judgment which obliges the 
state to give back the investors' capital. However, this news 
item is totally devoid of the truth. What really happened is 
that three investors of capital in small investment companies 
filed a lawsuit against the owners of the investment companies 
and the state in which they demanded that they give back the 
investors' capital. The court appointed an expert to determine 
the value of this capital and the deposits, who should pay them, 
who was responsible for their not being paid so that a judgment 
can be rendered against these persons. After that, the case was 
delayed until the expert could present his fees, and the case is 
still in the courts. This is why this news item was totally 
false. 
<H5>  Responsibility of the State </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Leaving aside this news item, what is your 
comment concerning what some investors are saying to the effect 
that the intervention of the state and law agencies such as the 
Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the State 
Prosecutor between the investment companies and the investors is 
the reason for the obstruction of the process restoring the 
claims of the investors against these companies? 
  [Al-'Arabi] There is no sound basis for saying this, because 
the state did not intervene in the matter of the investment 
companies until after it became a problem. In fact, it did not 
do this until the investors demanded that the state intervene. 
Just so I don't forget, let us go back and review what happened. 
What we see is that many loud voices demanded that the state 
quickly intervene. And when the state legally intervened, these 
companies were exposed, because they had not been operating on 
sound bases. The state intervened on the basis of the wish of 
the masses of people in order to protect the Egyptian economy 
and in order to protect the investors themselves. The reason is 
that, since fraudalent acts were taking place, it was possible 
for these companies to go bankrupt and for their owners to flee 
abroad. In the case of some companies, this really happened. In 
such a case, the investors will not get any of their money back. 
This is why the state intervened and issued a law regulating 
activity in these companies. When the law was put into effect, 
these companies were exposed and they stumbled after they were 
unable to reconcile their situations with the law. For this 
reason, they were then attached. 
  Even yesterday, some of the owners of the small investment 
companies, who had been jailed and whose cases were still before 
the courts, demanded the authorization of the attorney general 
to sell the assets of their companies so that they could pay the 
investors what they owed them--in spite of the fact that this 
long period of time had gone by without their even thinking of 
authorizing anyone to do so. 
  It was possible for me, as the attorney general, not to 
intervene at all in this matter, and to wait until judgments 
were issued against the owners of these companies. And it was 
likely that the verdict would be that the owners of these 
companies would be acquitted and we would be forced to turn over 
the capital to them, and after that it would not be our concern 
what they would do with the investors. 
  But what I did as attorney general--especially since it is 
well known that cases such as these drag on a long time in the 
courts--was to offer to let the owners of the companies who were 
the defendants return to the investors what they owed them by 
means of what they would earn from the sales. This is what we 
are doing right now. I believe that, if the Office of the 
Attorney General had not intervened and undertaken the sales 
operations itself, no one would have gotten the prices at which 
we are selling, because purchasers have boundless trust in the 
Office of the Attorney General. This is why we are getting 
higher prices than what the market prices are. For example, a 
plot of land that was owned by the al-Sharif Company was offered 
for sale by means of an auction after being advertised in the 
newspapers. Only one company offered to buy it, and the amount 
offered was 17 million Egyptian pounds. I cancelled this auction 
and did not accept the price because, in my opinion, the price 
was not high enough. Then I authorized a bank to sell this land. 
The bank then negotiated with the company which came to the 
auction, and the result was that the price of the land rose to 
22 million instead of 17 million Egyptian pounds, with the 
company asking for some easy terms dealing with the payment 
period. However, I even rejected this offer, and I finally sold 
the plot of land for 24 million Egyptian pounds. Nevertheless, 
all I hear is blame that is being cast on us now because this 
activity is not within our domain. Let it be known to everyone 
that it really is not my job to do buying or selling. But 
sometimes I occupy myself with such a matter in order to solve a 
national problem that could affect the nation's higher interest, 
especially since millions of Egyptian families were victims of 
these companies. After all, should the attorney general remain 
silent and just look on as a big problem occurs that we might 
not be able to solve later on--particularly since we fear that 
there are some individuals or parties who have an interest in 
seeing the problem continue to exist, without a solution? I say 
that I fear this, but I am not accusing anyone in particular. 
  [Al-Husayni] Who are these parties that have an interest in 
seeing the problem of the investment companies remain unsolved? 
  [Al-'Arabi] I am not accusing anybody in particular. But, as 
I mentioned, I am afraid that there are those who have an 
interest in having this problem remain in existence and not be 
solved. 
<H5>  Convicted Investor Makes Business Contacts </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] The fact that Ahmad Tawfiq al-Rayyan left 
prison 
to administer the capital of the investors has made many people 
inquire, with astonishment, whether or not a person who has been 
sentenced to hard labor because he was not trustworthy 
concerning investors' money and rights should be allowed to 
administer this capital once again? 
  [Al-'Arabi] Ahmad Tawfiq [al-Rayyan] did not leave prison in 
order to administer the capital of the al-Rayyan Company. What 
happened is that the Office of Confiscation [idarat 
al-tahaffudh] occasionally requests that he be let out of jail 
in order to make contacts to get buyers for the company's 
assets. Ahmad al-Rayyan does not administer the capital, because 
he does not have the right to do so after being sentenced to 
hard labor. This makes it illegal for him to undertake any 
administration or disposal [of such capital]. A "caretaker" has 
been appointed for him. In addition to this, Ahmad al-Rayyan, 
after being sentenced, authorized me, as the attorney general, 
to sell the company's assets. For this reason, when we bring him 
to the Office of Confiscation, we do this because this man has 
numerous contacts with many people who could buy the company's 
assets. I utilize him, but I do not let him administer the 
capital. I, in turn, should be asking: How could a man who is in 
prison and has been sentenced to hard labor be allowed to 
administer capital such as this? This is impossible, but we are 
still being hounded by these rumors. 
  [Al-Husayni] Concerning the administration of the investment 
companies' capital, there are those who are wondering whether or 
not the Office of the Attorney General has people who are 
qualified financially and business-wise to administer capital 
totalling more than 1.5 billion Egyptian pounds. 
  [Al-'Arabi] As for administration of the capital of the 
investment companies, the Office of the Attorney General does 
not intervene in the manner that is imagined. However, we 
entrust this work to people who did this administrative work 
before--in exchange for the payment of certain fees. What we do 
is supervise this work. This supervision is done by means of an 
accounts monitoring agency that audits all of the transactions 
undertaken by those undertaking the administration so that no 
fraud takes place. So, as far as the office is concerned, the 
administration [of these companies] is not considered to be a 
problem. The work is done under the supervision of the Capital 
Attachment Office, and experts are sent to audit the 
transactions of the administrators who supervise the 
administration in order to see if there are any irregularities. 
If any irregularities are found, we call to account the person 
who is at fault, and this is not something that is difficult to 
do. In fact, we did succeed in paying back the capital to all of 
the investors in some of the small investment companies when 
their owner requested that the office settle his situation. 
<H5>  Overlapping Spheres of Activity </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] The Office of the State Prosecutor General is 
also working on the administration of millions [of Egyptian 
pounds] of capital deposited by investors in the investment 
companies. Is this not considered to be duplication and 
overlapping in spheres of activity, especially since it is a 
known fact that the Office of the State Prosecutor deals with 
economic issues? 
  [Al-'Arabi] This is no duplication or overlapping in the 
spheres of activity, and each office is preceding along its path 
in accordance with the system that it is governed by. 
  [Al-Husayni] Do you mean that there is coordination between 
the Office of the State Prosecutor and the Office of the 
Attorney General, in the sense that each of them deals with 
particular types of cases, in accordance with the system of 
operation in each of the offices? 
  [Al-'Arabi] No, there are no specializations involved. But 
each office does its work in accordance with the complaints that 
it receives. Furthermore, if the complaints involve the 
occurrence of a crime, then they become the sphere of activity 
of the Office of the Attorney General. 
  [Al-Husayni] The investment company cases, in general, 
involve crimes such as swindling, committing fraud in order to 
gain control of the capital of investors, and refusal to make 
payments. 
  [Al-'Arabi] The establishment of capital investment 
companies, in general, is something that is governed by law, and 
any violation of this law constitutes a definite crime, and this 
falls within the sphere of authority of the attorney general. 
For this reason, most of the investment company cases come to 
our office. However, what has happened is that some of those who 
deposited capital in the investment companies took their 
complaints to the Office of the State Prosecutor General either 
before coming to the Office of the Attorney General or before 
our office could take measures. The Office of the State 
Prosecutor has been faster when it comes to taking measures 
dealing with attachment. In order that the owner of a company 
not be subjected to attachment in two different agencies, the 
Office of the Attorney General is starting to follow the path of 
dealing with criminal cases and lawsuits, and is allowing the 
state prosecutor to take the other steps and measures, as long 
as the perpetrator of the criminal act has been subjected to 
attachment by the Office of the State Prosecutor. 
  [Al-Husayni] What is your response to those who say that it 
would be more correct and appropriate to entrust the 
administration of the investment companies to banks since they 
have expertise in dealing with financial and business 
transactions? 
  [Al-'Arabi] The answer is simple. The Office of the Attorney 
General right now does not undertake the administration of the 
capital of the investment companies. However, our office does 
undertake the liquidation of the assets of these companies and 
hands over the earnings from the liquidation to the investors, 
the owners of this capital. We basically do not resort to 
relying on the administrative method. The reason for this is 
that, if we had decided to repay the investors by means of 
administering the capital of these companies, these investors 
would have to wait 20 or 30 years before receiving the full 
amount of their repayments. This is why we resorted to the 
method of immediate liquidation of these companies by means of 
selling them off, in order that the investors be repaid faster. 
Also, banks do not purchase the assets of these companies, but 
it is possible for them to finance buyers. This has actually 
happened in the case of some banks. 
<H5>  Investors' Troubles Will End in 1994 </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] The problem of the investors and the investment 
companies has been in your office since 1988, that is, for six 
years, but the victims of these companies still have not been 
payed what they are owed, and this is in spite of the fact that 
statements are continually being made to the effect that a 
solution to the problem is near at hand. This has caused the 
investors to become desperate and frustrated. 
  [Al-'Arabi] Our office has had the problem of the investment 
companies since 1988. But I only took up the problem in 1991, 
when I was appointed attorney general. Therefore I am not 
responsible for the preceding period. Also, I am only 
responsible for statements that I myself make. Concerning the 
al-Rayyan case, I have fulfilled my promise to the investors and 
they have actually received 10 percent of their capital back. 
And now we have enough money to pay them another 10 percent. 
Right now we are undertaking an urgent study, which will be 
finished this week. There are businessmen and plant owners who 
are prepared to offer goods and products to the investors. Thus, 
instead of receiving 10 percent in the form of cash, it would be 
possible for them to receive goods worth 20 or 30 percent of 
what they are owed. 
  [Al-Husayni] Are these goods produced by the al-Rayyan and 
al-Sharif companies, as was previously the case? 
  [Al-'Arabi] No. These goods are produced by Egyptian plants 
in general. 
  [Al-Husayni] Will the owners of these plants furnish these 
goods and products in return for their purchase of the assets of 
the investment companies? 
  [Al-'Arabi] No. The owners of these plants will provide 
these 
goods immediately. Then they will give us a chance to sell the 
assets of the companies and pay them what we owe them after 
that. An agreement actually has been reached with them. This 
will enable us to achieve more than one goal. First of all, it 
will stimulate Egyptian industry, and secondly, the investors 
will be paid back what is owed to them at greater rates than 
would be possible if we paid them only with the money that we 
have available right now. 
  [Al-Husayni] People have been very patient, but they are 
wondering when the problem of the investors and the capital 
investment companies will be solved once and for all? 
  [Al-'Arabi] If the rate of sales continues at its present 
pace, I am hoping that the troubles of the investors will end in 
1994. I am trying extremely hard to have the problem of the 
capital investment companies be solved by the end of this year. 
If some loose ends concerning this problem remain, they will be 
very simple matters and will be beyond my control. I should 
remark that this matter is one that requires a great deal of 
effort. For example, if the al-Rayyan investors are paid back 10 
percent of what they are owed, this means that we have to pay 
them more than 150 million Egyptian pounds. The same situation 
applies to the al-Sharif investors. So let the investors be 
lenient with me and give me a chance to be able to finish this 
task as it should be done and as I hope to do it. 
  [Al-Husayni] What about the investors with the al-Sa'd 
Company? Will their troubles also come to an end, and will they 
get paid back in 1994? 
  [Al-'Arabi] The al-Sa'd case is being taken up by the Office 
of the Attorney General as a criminal case. But the capital of 
the al-Sa'd Company has been attached by the Office of the State 
Prosecutor General. Therefore you should ask the state 
prosecutor general about what is owed to the al-Sa'd investors. 
<H5>  Emergency Law Powers </H5>
  [Issue No. 2: In its interview with the attorney general, 
AKHIR SA'AH then took up the matter of the Emergency Law, which 
has been put into effect for an additional three years.] 
  [Al-Husayni] The renewal of the Emergency Law for three more 
years has led us to wonder what the effect of this law has been 
on the work and investigations conducted by the Office of the 
Attorney General. We are wondering, in particular, whether or 
not it is true--as some members of the opposition have been 
saying--that it is difficult for accused persons to receive 
complete justice when this law is being applied. 
  [Al-'Arabi] The Emergency Law is like any other law. It does 
not affect the rules of conducting investigations according to 
which we proceed. There is no dispute about the fact that the 
Office of the Attorney General does its job, whether according 
to the Emergency Law, the Criminal Procedure Law, or any other 
law. In our agency, work is being conducted according to one 
system and one set of guarantees. 
  [Al-Husayni] However, it is being said that the Emergency 
Law 
gives the Office of the Attorney General additional powers that 
might diminish the rights of citizens when they are subject to 
investigations. 
  [Al-'Arabi] All of the guarantees provided to accused 
persons 
by the Criminal Procedure Law apply to them completely under the 
Emergency Law. Perhaps what is meant by this talk is the fact 
that the Emergency Law grants to the Office of the Attorney 
General the authority to use pre-trial detention in connection 
with crimes subject to this law. An example of this is the 
powers of the investigative judge. This is not considered to be 
an additional prerogative of the Office of the Attorney General. 
Many laws already give our office this authority. The most 
recent is Law No. 105 dealing with the establishment of State 
Security Courts which gives the Office of the Attorney General, 
in connection with crimes such as bribery and embezzlement as 
well as crimes which violate the internal and external security 
of the state, the powers of an investigative judge when 
investigating crimes such as these, and they include pre-trial 
detention. Thus the Emergency Law does not at all affect the 
work done by the Office of the Attorney General. Perhaps the 
effect of this law is to be found in the name of the type of 
trial in accordance with which the accused is tried, as well as 
the procedure of certification of judgments which differs from 
that of appeals against judgments. This is a matter which does 
not affect or directly apply to the work done by the Office of 
the Attorney General. 
  [Al-Husayni] Since we are talking about pre-trial detention, 
[I should mention that] it is a known fact that pre-trial 
detention of the accused before conviction is a matter which 
infringes upon his freedom. It is supposed to be used only to a 
very limited extent, such as if one fears that the accused will 
flee or if the accused has no known address. However, it should 
be remarked that the Office of the Attorney General has started 
utilizing this authority in a way which transforms it into a 
type of penal authority. 
  [Al-'Arabi] That does not happen at all. Pre-trial detention 
is a preventive measure done in order to guarantee that justice 
be carried out. It generally is done when one fears that the 
accused will obtain access to witnesses, will influence them, or 
will tamper with the evidence of a case. Pre-trial detention is 
not a punishment, as you have said it is. The Office of the 
Attorney General does not inflict any punishment on any 
individual. However, in big cases such as cases of terrorism, it 
is possible that the accused persons will have known addresses, 
but should one release them? The same applies to bribery and 
embezzlement cases. Should we release the accused persons so 
that they would tamper with the evidence of the case or gain 
access to the witnesses before they come to trial? In cases such 
as these, the accused is detained before trial, and when the 
investigation is over, he is either charged with the crime and 
brought to trial as a prisoner or he is released. 
  But as for what is being said about the Office of the 
Attorney General expanding its use of pre-trial detention, this 
has not happened--unless you have already done a statistical 
survey [and found this to be true]. Even if this has happened, 
we could undertake a statistical survey which would show that 
the number of crimes has increased. Consequently, there has not 
been any expansion in the use of this right on the part of the 
Office of the Attorney General. 
  [Issue No. 3: The interview then switched over to the issue 
dealing with journalists.] 
  [Al-Husayni] Permit me at this point to speak as a 
journalist 
and a member of the Journalists' Union. We have come to feel a 
sense of alarm concerning the steps being taken against 
journalists when they are being investigated in cases dealing 
with the publication of news. These steps conflict with the 
guarantees provided to them by the Union Law, the Press 
Authority Law, and other laws. 
  [Al-'Arabi] First of all, there is no problem between the 
attorney general's apparatus and the journalists. Secondly, what 
are the reasons for the alarm and the fear? When has the Office 
of the Attorney General ever dealt with a journalist in a way 
that violates his freedom or conflicts with the Press Authority 
Law? 
  [Al-Husayni] This actually did happen with some of my 
colleagues who were being investigated recently in connection 
with cases concerning the publication of news. They were 
arrested, detained, and then released on bail in a manner that 
violates the text of the Press Authority Law in Article No. 135 
of the Criminal Procedure Law. 
  [Al-'Arabi] It is very unfortunate that the newspapers are 
publishing and circulating talk like this that has no basis in 
fact. I mentioned this in a response to the head of the 
Journalists' Union. Also, we should differentiate between the 
measures taken by the Office of the Attorney General and those 
taken by others. The question is: Has the Office of the Attorney 
General ever ordered the arrest of a journalist? This has never 
happened. Has the Office of the Attorney General ever put a 
journalist in jail for the purpose of pre- trial detention? This 
has never happened. 
  [Al-Husayni] Who are these others, and do they have the 
authority to commit these deeds that are in violation of the law? 
  [Al-'Arabi] Don't ask me about others, for the simple reason 
that I do not know the facts concerning the problem. Any 
journalist who says that there is a problem between him and the 
Office of the Attorney General, and does not submit a written 
complaint so that I can take investigative measures such as I do 
with any case, is indisputably mistaken. Often citizens come to 
me with complaints about the behavior of members of the Office 
of the Attorney General. These complaints are submitted in 
writing, and then the Judicial Inspection Agency begins looking 
into them. And if a mistake has been committed, the person who 
made the mistake is immediately called to account. But as far as 
journalists are concerned, so far I have not received a single 
complaint. The problem has only been brought up on the pages of 
the newspapers. I am not responsible for dealing with what has 
been brought up on the pages of newspapers. We always say that 
any citizen who has a complaint against a member of the Office 
of the Attorney General, a member of the judicial authority, or 
anyone else has to submit the complaint to us in order that we 
conduct the investigation concerning it so that we can verify 
the truth and seriousness of the complaint. I often receive 
complaints in which citizens complain against each other. It is 
more appropriate for me to receive complaints against the agency 
that works with me. But, in this case, a matter is being brought 
up in the newspapers or at Journalists' Union meetings in order 
to have me make decisions based on only one point of view--that 
of the journalists. Have you even listened to the other point of 
view? 
  [Al-Husayni] What is the other point of view it would be 
possible for us to listen to now? 
  [Al-'Arabi] I am not the person with an opinion concerning 
the case you are talking about. I am an investigative party. For 
this reason, the journalist who is the aggrieved party should 
have submitted a complaint in order that it be investigated. 
Then we would have announced which party was in the 
wrong--whether it was the journalist, the prosecuting attorney, 
or the advocate general. I have received a letter from the 
Journalists' Union, which made its demands as a result of what 
happened. But I ask--on what basis does the Journalists' Union 
reach this verdict? Would it not be sounder if the journalist 
who is the aggrieved party were to submit a complaint in order 
that it be investigated? When one of the members of the Office 
of the Attorney General is found guilty, then we will determine 
the claims. 
  [Al-Husayni] As the person responsible for the Office of the 
Attorney General, [do you know whether or not] there is a 
dispute concerning providing the guarantees that are guaranteed 
by the Journalists' Law? 
  [Al-'Arabi] Do the Press Authority and the Press Law forbid 
questioning and investigating a journalist if we have received a 
particular complaint [about him]? What happens is, whenever 
someone submits a complaint to us about a particular person or 
party, the law determines for us the bases on which we may 
investigate these complaints. I deny that anyone in the Office 
of the Attorney General has violated the guarantees provided for 
in the law in the case of any person in our society, whether a 
journalist or not. If any journalist, in his opinion, feels that 
an investigator has resorted to procedures outside the law in 
his investigation with him, then he must submit a complaint to 
us in order that we investigate it. When such a journalist does 
not receive what he feels is owed to him, then the attacks in 
the newspapers begin. Casting suspicion on the Office of the 
Attorney General, which is a fundamental branch of the 
judiciary, is not in anyone's interest, especially if the other 
point of view is not listened to. This is why I was hoping that 
someone would contact us or submit a written complaint 
concerning what occurred to him that was outside the law, so 
that we could then investigate the matter. 
  It is being said that we did not notify the Journalists' 
Union before an investigation. First of all, the law has not 
determined the manner in which we are supposed to notify the 
Journalists' Union. When a representative from the union is 
present with the journalist during the investigation, does this 
not constitute notification of the union? What was said would be 
true if the investigation had been carried out without the 
presence of a representative. And if the journalist were present 
without a representative from the union, the prosecuting 
attorney would not be able to ask him any questions. A 
journalist has the right to tell the prosecuting attorney that 
he will not talk to him unless a representative from the union 
is present. 
  [Al-Husayni] Did you conduct an investigation into 
complaints 
by journalists? 
  [Al-'Arabi] Certainly I asked questions and investigated, 
but 
I will not talk about the results of this investigation, because 
so far I have not received a [written] complaint from anyone. 
<H5>  The Law and Economic Crimes </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 4: Let us now switch over to another 
issue, which is that of the spread of economic crimes recently 
to a degree which threatens the processes of development and 
national security in Egypt. In your personal estimation, and by 
virtue of your position as attorney general, do you feel that 
crimes of this type have increased to the point that they 
require the issuance of new laws and new legislation to 
decisively deal with them? 
  [Al-'Arabi] I don't believe that we need more laws. The laws 
that we have on the books are enough. But we do need more 
decisiveness and experience when dealing with cases of this 
type. So in spite of the fact that we abolished the prosecuting 
offices that specialized in some types of crimes, we have not 
changed anything as far as the economic crimes are concerned. 
Thus we have the Public Property Prosecution Office, the 
Financial and Administrative Affairs Prosecution Office, and the 
Tax Prosecution Office. All of these prosecution offices 
specialize in economic crimes. In addition to this, we are 
constantly endeavoring to provide support for these prosecution 
offices by means of providing new expertise and specializations 
and holding high-level training courses for men from the 
Attorney General's Office at the National Criminal Investigation 
Center as support for our practical training. 
  [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion concerning the proposal 
made by some specialists concerning issuing new legislation to 
regulate the use of checks? 
  [Al-'Arabi] My opinion is that, as far as the current 
economic situation and those persons dealing in the financial 
market are concerned, if we put controls on the use of checks 
that would be stricter than they are now, this would have some 
negative consequences. For example, it is possible that trade 
and commerce would suffer some degree of stagnation. 
  Also, this might cause some difficulties for employees who 
purchase their basic necessities on the installment plan. Why 
not leave things as they are until economic conditions improve? 
If we slap restrictions on checks, we will find merchants then 
becoming afraid to deal with checks. For this reason, I feel 
that we should wait a while so that we do not affect the 
situation that currently exists between buyers and sellers. 
<H5>  Terrorism Issues </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 5: Egypt has experienced many waves 
of 
terrorism during the last 40 years, and [most of the time] such 
terrorism has been dealt with and ended in the space of just a 
few months, as was the case with the Muslim Brotherhood in 1948, 
1965, and 1970. What are the reasons for the continuation of the 
current wave of terrorism that began in 1990? Is it because of 
the expertise the terrorists have acquired as a result of their 
previous experience, or is it because they are taking advantage 
of the climate of freedom and democracy which prevails in Egypt 
nowadays? 
  [Al-'Arabi] No one can say that a climate of freedom and 
democracy can be exploited for the purposes of terrorist 
operations. But the fact is that the problem of terrorism in 
Egypt is a problem with many ramifications, and no individual 
can express his opinion on it without being versed in all the 
aspects of the problem. For this reason, allow me to apologize 
for not answering this question, even though I have been living 
with this problem for a long time. A discussion of this problem 
requires specialists in numerous fields. What I mean is that I 
am able to talk about the problem only from the point of view of 
the judiciary. 
  [Al-Husayni] But what we want is your opinion as a member of 
the judiciary. 
  [Al-'Arabi] I cannot answer this question merely from the 
point of view of the judiciary. The reason is that it would be a 
fragmentary and incomplete answer. This problem has to be 
discussed on all levels--the social, economic, human, and 
psychological levels. Regarding the reasons for the continuation 
of the wave of terrorism for such a long time, I believe that 
these terrorists have, without a doubt, acquired experience from 
the former terrorist movements. Also, these terrorist groups 
have individuals abroad working for them, and the hand of 
justice has not been able to get to them. This is also one of 
the reasons why they are continuing their terrorism. 
  [Al-Husayni] Concerning the decision by the president to 
refer cases of terrorism to the military justice system because 
it decides cases quickly, why is the Military Prosecution Office 
not handling the investigation of these cases instead of the 
Office of the Attorney General? 
  [Al-'Arabi] When the president issues a decree to refer a 
particular case to the military justice system, the Office of 
the Attorney General forgoes the completion of its procedure and 
the case is referred to the military justice system, that is, 
the investigation is conducted by the Military Prosecution 
Office and then the case is tried by the military justice 
system. Also, not all terrorism cases are referred to the 
military justice system. The president feels that there are 
terrorism cases that do not need to be referred to the military 
justice system because they are not so important. So not all 
cases of terrorism are referred to the military courts. But this 
does happen with major cases that could involve bad consequences 
for the nation, such as the cases involving shooting tourists. 
This is a matter that requires quick steps and a quick 
deterrent. For this reason, there are terrorism cases that are 
investigated by the Office of the Attorney General and then 
referred to the regular courts. 
<H5>  Attorney General's Office and the Inspection Control </H5>
  [Al-Husayni] Issue No. 6: There are cases that have stirred 
up public opinion and received a great deal of attention in the 
media when investigations concerning them were being conducted, 
but then these cases ended with no convictions being made. They 
include the cases of Lucy Artin and al-Mahjub. Did this happen 
because of mistakes made during the process of arrest or 
investigation, or were there other reasons for this? 
  [Al-'Arabi] All the fuss raised concerning certain cases, as 
I have said, is the work of the media. I am not responsible for 
that. The attorney general's apparatus conducts its 
investigations and then assesses what has been done. That is, it 
decides whether or not the case should be sent to court and 
whether or not there is enough evidence for a conviction. But 
unfortunately, when an incident happens, the media quickly jumps 
in and utilizes it as a story to be published, with a lot of 
hype, even though they do not know what has been going on in the 
investigations. Furthermore, as I always say, a judge looks at a 
case in a way that is different from the point of view of a 
person who is far away from the judge's podium. In fact, it is 
possible for one judge's view to be different from another's. 
Criminal justice is based on the judge being convinced of the 
facts of a case. If the judge is convinced that a person is 
guilty, then that person is convicted, but if the judge is not 
convinced that he is guilty, then he is acquitted--and there is 
no argument about the matter. The judge's view of the matter is 
more all-inclusive and broader because he makes judgments 
concerning a situation on the basis of the intuition and 
conscience of a judge. In addition to this, he takes into 
consideration the results of the investigation that he 
undertakes in the court session. 
  [Al-Husayni] It is also a known fact that the Office of the 
Attorney General has the authority of inspection. But the 
practice has been to authorize police officers, in their 
capacity as persons commissioned by the judiciary authorities, 
to undertake this work. For this reason, we often see criminals 
being acquitted, especially in narcotics cases, because the 
inspection procedure was carried out in a way that violates the 
law, both in form as well as in content. Why do members of the 
Office of the Attorney General not exercise the power of 
inspection themselves so that things are carried out in a sound 
manner? 
  [Al-'Arabi] Fundamentally, the members of the Office of the 
Attorney General carry out the investigation procedure as a 
whole, and not merely the inspection, because the inspection is 
just one of the procedures of the investigation. But the law 
entitles a member of the Office of the Attorney General to 
authorize any policeman commissioned by the authority of the 
judiciary to conduct this procedure in his place. The members of 
the Office of the Attorney General actually conduct the 
inspections in important cases, particularly since we do not 
have enough men in the Office of the Attorney General to conduct 
the inspections in all the cases. Furthermore, in cases 
involving narcotics or theft, if a member of the Office of the 
Attorney General goes out to conduct an inspection, he may end 
up endangering his life. This is particularly true because 
members of the Office of the Attorney General are not allowed to 
carry weapons--so that accused persons cannot claim that they 
used a weapon against them. So if members of the Office of the 
Attorney General go out and hunt down drug smugglers and armed 
criminals, they are endangering their lives. But the matter is 
different in the case of a policeman, because he carries a 
weapon and works within the framework of an integrated plan to 
pursue individuals who are in violation of the law. 
  It might happen that the procedure undertaken by a policeman 
commissioned by the authority of the judiciary is unsound and 
thus results in an acquittal, as you mentioned. But such persons 
who are commissioned by the authority of the judiciary, and who 
are police officers, have studied the law and are perfectly 
aware of what sound arrest procedures are. So such acquittals do 
not happen merely because a member of the Office of the Attorney 
General has authorized a police officer to undertake an 
inspection. If this does happen, it is because the officer did 
not follow the procedures stipulated by the law.

  [Text] The main reason for the pressures that are being 
applied by America, international Zionism, and Britain, as well 
as for the demand for concessions from Arab parties, are the 
absence of a united Arab position and the absence of an Arab 
force similar to Iraq's effective force. The reasons for their 
30-nation agression against Iraq are no longer concealed from 
anyone. Indeed, they themselves have taken to bragging about it 
after having enslaved some Arab rulers and exploited Arab 
resources against Arab interests. No honest Arab can have the 
slightest doubts that America, Britain, and Ziionism are 
implementing a plan to humiliate the Arabs and deprive them of 
their rights and resources, transforming them into a conduit for 
American, British, and Zionist interests. As a start, America 
has succeeded in silencing some Arab rulers and in exploiting 
others to destroy the bulwark and hope of the Arabs: Iraq. They 
have left Iraq and the people of Iraq to pay the price alone, to 
the accompaniment of traitorous Arab instigation, an indifferent 
Arab stance, and a hateful international one. This, while Iraq 
was placing and continues to place Arab interests above all its 
own interests. The leader, Saddam Husayn, had previously warned 
the Arabs against dangerous blunders toward which they were 
being pushed by the American and British leaderships. America is 
injecting them with a fatal cancer in order to kill their 
national ambitions and expectations in the interests of 
"Israel," its ambitions and greed for Arab wealth and lands. 
Iraq pointed this out a long time ago, before the 30-nation 
aggression against it. The British station (BBC) broadcast a 
discussion between two political personalities, American and 
French. The first, Graham Fuller is one of the chief political 
analysts at the RAND Corporation in Washington. He had 
previously worked in the same capacity in the Middle East 
section of the Central Intelligence Agency. The second, Paul 
Balta [name as transliterated], is the director of the Center 
for the Study of the Contemporary Middle East at the New 
University of the Sorbonne. They admit in their discussion that 
the main purpose for the continuation of the embargo is to serve 
American, British, and Zionist strategic interests in the 
region. This, in spite of their admission that Iraq has 
implemented the resolutions of the United Nations. Fuller, the 
American expert, says: "From an official point of view, we want 
the implementation of the resolutions of the United Nations. 
From an unofficial point of view, we want to overturn the 
government in Iraq." Balta, the French expert, interjects to 
introduce additional American aims: "America also wants to keep 
up the pressure on Iraq as long as there is no fundamental 
progress in the "Arab-Israeli peace talks," as Iraq represents 
the greatest threat to "Israel" in the region. There are also 
the current economic and financial difficulties of the Kingdom 
of Saudi Arabia, America's most important ally in the region. If 
Iraq were to enter the oil market, the Saudi economy would 
collapse." The French expert adds: "When they speak of human 
rights in Iraq, they do so for local consumption. I am in 
complete agreement that the international community itself is 
violating the rights of Iraqi human beings." Explaining the 
reasons for France's participation in the aggression against 
Iraq, the French expert said: "Frankly, President Mitterrand was 
expecting political and economic benefits like the possibility 
of our participation in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations for 
peace and the increase in the share of French companies in the 
petroleum and arms industries. However, it now seems to me that 
France has met with frustration. My country has been determined 
for some weeks to serve its own interests first." The American 
and French experts admit that double standards and positions are 
being applied to Iraq in the West, especially in America. This 
is what Iraq had exposed before their 30-fold aggression.

<F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar] </F>
  [Text] Last night, the whole world saw and watched hour by 
hour the progress of a big political and diplomatic defeat for 
the United States and Britain in the Security Council. After an 
(American honeymoon) that lasted about three years, an American 
(troublesome era) has started; troubles and crises keep popping 
up, here and there. 
  During the last three lean years, through tremendous power, 
America succeeded in forcing the Security Council 
members--including the permanent ones--to support her! 
Accordingly, at the expiration of the two-month period, with 
just a hand signal, the American Ambassador to the United 
Nations could issue a declaration for an extension! 
  Currently, however, three out of the five permanent members 
of the UNSC--China, Russia, and France--have indicated that the 
positive stand of Iraq should be appreciated; both the United 
States and Britain have refused to appreciate that stand! 
Moreover, eight nonpermanent UNSC members are willing to deal 
positively with Iraq, while only Argentina has supported the 
American stand! 
  This openly stated change implies a few important facts. 
First is the fact that the United States has lost its ability to 
either have declarations easily issued or to forcibly subject 
the UNSC members to her will. The second fact is that America 
realizes the far reaching and dramatic impact of this change. 
This change denotes that the battle for lifting the embargo has 
entered its most dramatic turn in its three years of existence 
because America's rationale no longer holds and is no longer 
influential even inside the American Congress. This indicates 
that the power-and-pressure weapon has become weaker and does 
not have full impact on the majority of nations. 
  The third fact is that to keep on extending the embargo 
every 
two months is no longer a one-handed decision by America; the 
wishes and interests of other nations are now taken into 
consideration with regards to the extension because the embargo 
no longer harms the Iraqi people alone, but is harmful to the 
international community as well. For this reason, the rationale 
of those countries that support lifting the embargo will, as 
time goes on, be stronger and more effective; eventually it will 
become an established legal and interest-oriented decision. When 
this situation occurs, the difference of opinion that became 
apparent lately will develop into a crisis that would--every two 
months--aggravate and give rise to conflict and arguments and 
perhaps even lead to a dangerous dilemma that would last until 
the embargo is ended! 
  Iraqis who have persevered, suffered, and have been deprived 
of medicine and many of life's necessities can breath a sigh of 
relief today as the beam of hope has turned to a burning flame 
that is not liable for extinction. This flame will attract more 
of those people who have been trapped inside the venues of 
American vice and lead them to both truth and rationality. 
  The great sacrifices of our people have born fruit and have 
changed the embargo from an Iraqi issue to one for humanity as a 
whole. Currently, the human race is preparing--albeit slowly--to 
enter the political battle for lifting the embargo. 
  However, despite this positive change, the spirit of 
perseverance and the everlasting clinging to President Saddam 
Husayn's perception and leadership remains the main guarantee 
for putting an end to and shortening the duration of the battle 
to lift the embargo and also for sparing us more pain.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, high-ranking </F>
Ba'th Party official, by Hani Ibrahim 'Ashur; place and date not 
given: "Participants in the Russian Liberal Democratic Party 
Convention Stood Up and Cheered for Saddam Husayn and the Iraqi 
People"--first four paragraphs are AL-QADISIYAH introduction] 
  [Text] After more than three years have gone by since the 
tripartite aggression against Iraq, the principles of the mother 
of all battles are still shining and illuminating the paths of 
our struggle as well as human civilization and freedom, and the 
principles of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party still express the 
depth of our commitment to the human principles and values that 
have been the foundation of the course of human history. 
  It is on the basis of these truths that relations between 
political movements and the principles of honorable men in the 
world have united and adopted firm positions in order to hoist 
the banner of truth and reject the system of Western trusteeship 
and hegemony over the free and independent peoples of the world. 
  Part of the flowing river of live and battle-inspired 
friendships has been the relationship of the Russian Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] to our Arab Socialist Ba'th Party. A 
party delegation from Iraq, headed by Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the party's Iraqi Regional Command, 
represented the Ba'th Party at the general convention of the 
LDP, which was held during the last few days. 
  Our newspaper AL-QADISIYAH held this interview with Comrade 
'Abd-al-Ghafur in order that we learn more about his recent 
visit to Moscow: 
  ['Ashur] You visited Moscow after the UN Security Council 
last month reviewed and discussed the subject of the blockade 
against Iraq and after Russia announced its position calling for 
lifting the blockade within the framework of this review [of 
Iraq's situation]. How was this Russian position reflected in 
your meetings with Russian political leaders? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Through our meetings with party leaders, 
people representing political forces, and official leaders 
during our visit in Moscow we discovered that there is a common 
denominator among the opinions of the official leaders and some 
of the party leaders concerning the necessity of lifting the 
blockade against Iraq. This was summarized in the Russian 
position taken in the Security Council during the last review. 
The source of this position is the fact that Russia realizes 
what its interest is. Official and party leaders have asserted 
that continuing the blockade against Iraq would cause great harm 
not only to Iraq, but also to Russia and its people. It is 
sufficient for me to point out that Zhirinovskiy, leader of the 
LDP, as well as the vice president of the Russian Communist 
Party and Russia's first deputy minister of foreign affairs, 
have all asserted that the Russian people have expressed their 
support for the position taken by Russia in the Security Council 
because of the fact that this position is in the interest of the 
Russian people and expresses the adherence to the values of 
friendship that binds the Russian and Iraqi peoples. The 
expression of this fact came out clearly in our meetings, 
through the common denominator that we referred to, and due to 
the fact that Russia, at the official, party, and popular 
levels, feels that its interest dictates that it work toward 
having the blockade against Iraq lifted and achieving the 
implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. All this is in 
addition to the fact that there are common interests between the 
two nations. It is a known fact that there are extensive common 
economic and trade interests between Russia and Iraq that are 
governed by agreements that were in force before the tripartite 
aggression against Iraq. 
  ['Ashur] Does this mean that Russian public opinion realizes 
what Russia's economic and political interests are and is urging 
Russia to move in the direction of taking a position vis-a-vis 
the blockade against Iraq? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] It is a known fact that one cannot totally 
separate politics from economics because of the close connection 
between them and the fact that they mutually influence each 
other. Due to this fact, there is a feeling which predominates 
among Russian circles--and which the Russian media, official 
leaders, and party leaders have begun expressing in one form or 
another--concerning the fact that Russia's international 
position should not be ignored. They say that Russia is a 
superpower and has international influence. These Russian 
official and party circles are attempting to assert this fact by 
means of taking some positions. At this point we could refer to 
the recent Russian position taken in Security Council meetings 
concerning the blockade against Iraq that shows a basic 
departure from the position taken by the United States. This is 
something that has happened for the first time. Russia announced 
its position, resembling that of China and France, which 
represents a positive development regarding the matter of 
continuing the blockade against Iraq and requiring the Security 
Council to honor its commitments within the framework of 
Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687. 
  ['Ashur] In light of the present situation, what are your 
expectations concerning the Russian position during the next 
review to be held by the Security Council? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] In light of the situation that has cropped 
up in the international arena and Russia's attempt to define its 
role, we suppose that there will be a more positive development 
in the Russian position, during the next review, in the 
direction of implementation of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687, 
or at least with regard to setting a so-called "probationary 
period." Also, Russia has declared more than once that this 
matter should not be left unresolved, in accordance with the 
desire of Ekeus and the United States. 
  ['Ashur] During your time in Moscow, you participated in the 
LDP convention as representative of our Ba'th Party. How do you 
assess the results of this convention on the various levels both 
inside and outside Russia? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] As we know, decisions made by parties in 
any 
particular country are that country's internal affairs, and what 
the LDP or any other [Russian] party decides is a matter that 
concerns Russia. However, the matter that concerns us is the 
LDP's position regarding the blockade against Iraq and the 
influence of the steadfastness of the people of Iraq, due to the 
leadership of our leader Saddam Husayn, on the direction taken 
by the convention. The convention reached a clear decision to 
undertake serious action to lift the blockade against the people 
of Iraq by means of exercising its influence on its bloc in the 
Russian parliament, the Duma, and by means of the ties of the 
LDP to the various political forces and other parties both 
inside and outside Russia. The LDP considers the people of Iraq 
to be a live example of the human struggle [being waged in the 
world], and the other parties and political forces also believe 
this. They consider Iraq to be a model of steadfastness and 
insistence, and they consider Saddam Husayn to be a symbol of 
the human struggle being waged against imperialism and U.S. 
hegemony. The LDP convention's final communique emphasized the 
necessity of resuming trade and economic relations with Iraq and 
breaking the unjust blockade being imposed on it, both because 
of the benefit that this would bring to the Russian people and 
because it would be in the interest of both the Russian and 
Iraqi peoples, and because this would strengthen the values of 
friendship existing between the two nations. 
  When the speech for the Ba'th Party delegation at the 
convention was given, those present at the convention 
interrupted the speech numerous times with applause and cheers. 
They stood and cheered for Saddam Husayn. All the speeches by 
the delegations from parties and political forces from Germany, 
France, Bulgaria, and elsewhere saluted the positions taken by 
Iraq which has been steadfast in the face of imperialist 
hegemony, the delegations expressed how much they respect they 
had for the struggle being waged by the Iraqi people and their 
leader, Saddam Husayn, and they considered them to be an example 
to follow when confronting the so-called "new world order." 
  Iraq's position, steadfastness, and progress in development 
and construction in spite of the unjust blockade were a source 
of admiration. Zhirinovskiy clearly referred to this in his 
speech, and this admiration was also shown, without exception, 
by those at the convention who represented the parties and 
political forces participating in it. In addition to this, 
support was shown by the remarks made by the members of the 
convention who expressed their admiration for the position taken 
by Iraq's leader and people. 
  ['Ashur] Numerous political movements and parties have come 
up with a united platform that rejects U.S. hegemony over the 
world. How has this rejection been reflected in Russian public 
opinion, and did you find popular support for Iraq and for 
rejecting the political program of the imperialists? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] Party and official leaders in Russia have 
expressed their independent political opinion by means of their 
assertion of the fact that Russia was a nation that had strong 
influence over the course of international politics even before 
the emergence of the former Soviet Union. When they talked, they 
referred to czarist Russia and its influence in international 
politics and alliances. Then they would mention or try to assert 
that Russia currently possesses the elements of influence in 
international politics at least equal to the influence exercised 
by the former Soviet Union. I believe that this trend in what 
people are saying has been expressed by statements made by 
Russian leaders concerning Russia's positions vis-a-vis many 
international issues and positions and by means of what we have 
referred to concerning Russia's position regarding the Security 
Council's latest review of the blockade imposed on Iraq. 
  This is also being expressed by the Russian media within the 
scope of the government and political forces, especially the 
parliament. 
  ['Ashur] What is your assessment of the results of your 
visit 
to Moscow? 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] We believe that the party's visit to 
Russia--which took place as a result of a resolution passed by 
the party's leaders in which it was mentioned that continual 
political momentum had taken place in the direction of lifting 
the blockade against Iraq--achieved its aims in terms of 
explaining and elaborating on Iraq's position and meeting its 
commitments to Iraq in the effort to lift the blockade. Russian 
leaders, both on the party and official levels, demonstrated an 
understanding of and appreciation for Iraq's positions as well 
as its responsiveness to Security Council resolutions. We hope 
that the Security Council's next review will more fully reflect 
the development and effectiveness in Russia's position with 
regard to the effort to lift the blockade. 
  We elaborated on Iraq's role, the importance of its 
location, 
and its economic and cultural importance, since Iraq cannot at 
all be ignored. We also conveyed the fact that the values of the 
people of Iraq confirm Iraq's commitment to the positions of the 
nations, peoples, and political forces that have stood by Iraq 
in its struggle to lift the blockade. And we said that, with 
regard to trade and economic agreements, we will be mainly 
influenced by the positions taken by nations and companies 
vis-a-vis the blockade imposed on Iraq and their contribution 
toward lifting it. 
  ['Ashur] Thank you very much, Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghafur, for 
giving us this interview. 
  ['Abd-al-Ghafur] And I thank you and your esteemed newspaper 
AL-QADISIYAH.

  [Text] In spite of many indicators that shed light on the 
degree of expansion in Iraq's diplomatic, political, and 
economic relations with countries within and outside the region, 
it appears that Iraqis have adopted a new policy that 
concentrates on their national capabilities to overcome the 
embargo that has been imposed upon them for more than three 
years. 
  Its mechanics geared in the realm of action and not words, 
the new policy does not mean that Iraqi diplomacy has downgraded 
its efforts toward the international organization, especially as 
Iraqi delegations abroad have adopted quiet diplomacy and on the 
spot decisionmaking in bilateral relations. This is done in the 
context of a political reality that takes into consideration the 
mode of conduct of international relations and American 
strategic pressures through the Security Council and its bodies 
like the special commission and others. That means that Iraqi 
diplomatic activity has to deal with the special circumstances 
that have formed and continue to form obstacles and limitations 
that affect international bodies, countries, and organizations, 
attempting thereby to deliver these countries and organizations 
from consequences that might arise against them through American 
pressure. 
  Iraqi diplomatic activity has not been limited to 
dispatching 
delegations, but has included steps to reinvigorate the foreign 
service and to support its embassy employees in European 
countries. Diplomatic cadres have begun their travel to those 
countries after ministerial orders were issued to transfer them 
there. 
  According to its custom, Baghdad remains the hub of economic 
and political activity. No day passes without a delegation, or 
perhaps more than one, making the rounds of ministerial 
buildings, especially the foreign, petroleum, trade, and 
industry ministries. Some employees of these ministries are 
attempting to shroud the delegations and their nationalities in 
secrecy. However, it is clear that in addition to Asian 
countries, most of the European delegations belong to France and 
Russia. 
  No one can positively say that these delegations were unable 
to reach agreements or, at least, common understandings to 
respond to mutual interests in a manner that is in accordance 
with the nature of the international situation that is not 
applicable to Iraq alone, after it came to apply to other 
countries. It has become a restraint on their freedom to conduct 
their trade policies. 
  In order to overcome American surveillance, some countries 
have resorted to sending unofficial delegations headed by a 
former minister, or a member of parliament or presidents of 
chambers of commerce and industry in their own countries. 
  These delegations are often amazed by Iraqi negotiators whom 
they expect to be "agreeable" to enormous concessions which are 
usually called political or circumstancial concessions. However, 
they are confronted by sound commercial terms, which leave their 
adversaries with no option but to offer concessions themselves. 
  It is clear to the observer that current Iraqi diplomatic 
activity is proceeding with studied steps and limited goals. It 
has temporarily shelved wishful thinking and has adopted a 
realistic policy in practical steps. The February visits point 
to this. A delegation to Geneva to take part in a conference on 
human rights and disarmamemt was led by the foreign minister, 
Muhammed Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Tehran witnessed bilateral meetings 
between Iraqi and Iranian delegations. The assistant foreign 
minister, Sa'ad Faysal, led the Iraqi delegation. Up to the time 
of writing, Assistant Minister Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi is still in 
Paris conducting negotiations that, apparently, are not limited 
to trade and legal matters only, but cross over to political 
matters too. No doubt, they are focused on bilateral relations, 
which are witnessing improvements in numerous areas. 
  Diplomatic activity did not cease with the visits of last 
February. The current month of March will witness activities 
that are intended to pave the way for the creation of a 
non-hostile atmosphere for any new step that aims to break the 
severity of the embargo, even partially, during the coming 
Security Council deate. It is expected that Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz will arrive in New York to begin a series 
of meetings. If no official communique or notice of the visit 
and its date are issued by now, then it is expected that the 
time for the arrival of Mr. 'Aziz in New York will be the end of 
the month. 
  Observers expect the visit to have tangible positive results 
that will be the basis for realistic diplomatic relations that 
Iraq will be able to establish in various ways. The most 
important first step is the invigoration of bilateral relations 
with some European countries and the neighboring countries of 
the region. Then there is the positive cooperation with the 
organs of the international organization in such a manner as to 
frustrate any pretext that might be exploited under diplomatic 
cover to extend the duration of the embargo. Then there is 
placing the United Nations in such a position as to make it far 
from simple for it to bind the articles of the American 
political resolution with a legal and legitimate cover.

  [Text] The business of the International Conference on War 
Crimes and the Blockade's Violations of Human Rights in Iraq 
concluded last night in Baghdad. The text of a concluding 
statement issued from the conference follows: 
  The International Conference on War Crimes and the 
Blockade's 
Violations of Human Rights in Iraq met from 5-8 February 1994 in 
Baghdad. It built on the work of the nongovernmental 
organizations, societies, unions, and associations that are 
interested in human rights (and the legal and social issues 
related to them). Their undertaking obeys the call of similar 
nongovernmental organizations and societies that work in the 
legal and social fields related to human rights in Iraq. 
  Representatives of the human rights societies and the 
societies interested in children, representatives of lawyers' 
unions and jurists' societies and unions, representatives of 
cultural and religious societies, and Arab and foreign 
journalist foundations met together for this noble goal. 
  Likewise, various personalities from the Arab and Islamic 
world, and all the other parts of the world, attended for this 
goal. In addition a large number of Muslim and Christian 
religious people from various countries of the world attended. 
  The business of the conference was arranged around three 
basic topics. These topics were the objects of dialogue and 
elaborate discussions that lasted four days so that the 
participants could study the papers of the [conference's] work 
and deliver treatises and commentaries on them. The conference 
began its work on 5 February 1994 with a legal discussion by 
international law experts of a research paper that a 
duly-qualified Iraqi committee wrote entitled "Crimes and 
Violations of the United States and its Allies Against Human 
Rights in Iraq." The subject of this paper was the fundamental 
theme of the participants' discussion throughout almost the 
entire conference. A work session was dedicated to this topic on 
the first day of the conference's work. Mr. Ramsey Clark, the 
former American Attorney General, was chosen to lead these 
sessions, and Dr. Nazar al-'Anbaki was chosen to report the 
business of the conference. Dr. Muhammad al-Duri presented the 
Iraqi paper referred to above. Mr. Ramsey Clark delivered a 
commentary at the start of the session in which he reported that 
the American war crimes were committed based on the decisions of 
the Security Council. For this reason, he demanded that the 
United Nations system be amended. He criticized the Security 
Council, saying that it became a tool of the war. He demanded of 
the participants that they remember and carry in their hearts 
the memory of the thousands of Iraqis who were martyred as a 
result of the criminal activity undertaken by the United States. 
  He pointed out that he exposed these crimes in his book, 
The Fire This Time, which is a testimony of the war 
crimes and the blockade on the Iraqi people. He reported that 
the blockade does not just kill soldiers, rather it also kills 
children and, therefore, it is a comprehensive weapon of 
destruction because of its destructive effects, which are 
equivalent to the use of nuclear weapons. He demanded that the 
elimination of their use be worked toward and that a limit to 
their use be set, and a limit be set to the obstacles imposed on 
Iraq, because they continue to represent an enduring crime 
against humanity. He said that he would be happy to listen to 
the viewpoint [from the perspective] of international law in 
this conference. 
  After the presentation and discussion of the Iraqi paper, 
the 
participants unanimously agreed that the military attack that 
began the morning of 17 January 1991 began a continuous chain of 
enemy military actions against Iraq. These actions were taken by 
the United States and its allies. In view of its purposeful goal 
of destroying the civil, industrial, and economic structures in 
Iraq, with no military justification for it, and in view of the 
concentrated use of weapons and the dreadful, senseless bombing 
that killed thousands of civilians, the United States and its 
allies have been committing war crimes that have resulted in 
immense violations of law. 
  Likewise, its bombing and destruction of inhabited civil 
defense shelters in which hundreds of women and children and old 
people fell victim and in which Iraqi soldiers were buried alive 
on the battlefront, are, by its own description, willful, 
deliberate, and planned violations that are considered living 
proof of war crimes. 
  The conference eventually led to a confirmation of what was 
said in the experts' paper--that the United States violated the 
rules of international humanitarian law that relate to the 
protection of civilians during times of armed struggle, and that 
they broke the Geneva Conventions. Specifically, they broke the 
third convention relating to the protection of prisoners of war 
in the field. This resulted in the bad treatment of the Iraqi 
prisoners, as is represented in their willful abuse, 
humiliation, attempt at debasement, infliction of bodily and 
psychological injury, or killing. The documents, reports, and 
studies presented for the purposes of this conference bore 
witness to this. 
  The conference also eventually led to confirmation of the 
responsibility of the United States and its allies concerning 
violations of the principles of the law of war relating to the 
styles and methods of killing in two basic respects: 
  The first relates to the choice and expansion of bombing 
targets that are forbidden by international law--such as 
civilian leaders; grain and seed depositories; electric energy 
sources that are needed for health and human services; drinking 
water networks; military targets that are close to civilian 
centers, without previous warning; civilian and military 
hospitals; places of worship; and cultural antiquities. 
  The second relates to the use of prohibited weapons such as 
spent uranium bombs, vacuum bombs (fuel-air bombs), cluster and 
fission bombs, and incendiary napalm bombs. All of these are 
forbidden weapons. Use of these weapons violates the intent of 
the 1925 Geneva protocol and is considered a violation of the 
protocol's regulations on prohibition or restriction of the use 
of forbidden weapons. This protocol is attached to a 1980 
agreement on prohibition and restriction of certain traditional 
weapons that can be considered excessively harmful. In addition, 
the use violates the regulations of the First Protocol of 1977, 
the additional addendum to the Geneva conventions of 1949 
concerning the victims of war. 
  Concerning the crimes of the blockade, the participants in 
this conference criticized the tyrannical and harsh method with 
which the blockade against Iraq was imposed and applied, which 
represents an unparalleled precedent. Speaking specifically, 
after Iraq carried out the decisions of the Security Council, in 
spite of their severity and injustice, continuing to impose the 
blockade is for political, not legal reasons. Therefore, it is 
inconsistent with the decrees of the United Nations Charter. 
And, the use of the blockade as a means of political pressure is 
a new method in international relations the essence of which is 
the subjugation of the international organization's decisions to 
the selfish policies of a powerful, controlling state, which 
uses its imperialist, tyrannical power to terrorize the member 
states. The United Nations follows the logic of compliance with 
the will of the United States and grants it the legal cover 
required, or that it is forced to follow, toward Iraq, in 
compliance with the wish of the United States of America. The 
participants in the conference, in adopting the point of view of 
the totality of the legal and factual arguments that the 
international law experts' paper contained, came to the 
conclusion that continuing the blockade represents rightly a 
crime of collective annihilation. It represents a crime of 
collective annihilation by causing deficiency in food, medicine, 
and health supplies and the prevention of Iraq from using its 
frozen assets in the international and foreign banks and 
financial institutions, and enormous number of deaths among 
children, especially infants, pregnant women, the elderly, and 
the chronically ill, who are in need of certain types of 
medicine, as United Nations sources themselves confirmed as well 
as other neutral sources, and as some of the participants in 
this conference witnessed with their own eyes. The persistence 
in this situation is a violation of international humanitarian 
law; of the international commitment to economic and social 
rights; of the agreement of the rights of the child, which the 
United Nations set up in 1989 and which became valid in 1991; 
and of the principles of the international declaration for human 
rights. In addition it is a violation of the rules of 
international morals and of the requirements of the general 
human conscience. 
  The participating experts found that continuing the blockade 
raises the problem of responsibility of the Security Council 
itself and the credibility of the United Nations. The Security 
Council, which is responsible for maintaining peace and 
international security, is exceeding its jurisdictional 
boundaries by randomly devoting all its efforts to fabricating 
justifications and groundless reasons for continuing the 
blockade. The blockade continues in spite of Iraq's compliance 
with the conditions imposed on it by the Security Council. 
Therefore, they properly interpret this insistence as racist, 
and one that pays no attention to the tragedy and the suffering 
that the blockade has caused to a deep-rooted civilized people 
that has shared in a distinguished way in building human 
civilization. This situation is considered a violation of the 
provisions of the Charter, which is built on the foundation of 
respect for equality in rights among peoples. 
  Human rights organizations, lawyers' unions, nongovernmental 
societies, and humanitarian organizations presented, on the 
first day of the conference, their position on the crimes and 
violation confirmed by the legal experts. They attributed the 
crimes and violations to the United States and its allies, a 
topic that was an object of elaborate discussions in the 6 
February session, which was headed by Mr. Amin Shaqir from 
Jordan. Dr. Safiyya Safwa spoke and many participants commented, 
and the discussion eventually led to the support and 
confirmation of what was said in the main paper of the 
[conference's] work presented by the international law experts. 
The second part related to the effect of the crimes of the 
blockade on human rights, whether appling in particular to the 
legal aspects mentioned in the paper or relating to 
interpretation and factual attestation of the dangerous effects 
that have arisen by continuing to impose the blockade, for three 
years and in a severe way, and what have arisen from it in terms 
of continual deterioration in the social life, living 
conditions, and health, cultural, and environmental conditions 
that continue to threaten the basic, precious means of human 
subsistence. The participants in this conference expressed their 
resentment and their anger at the continued insistence on 
violating the Iraqi people's right to precious life. They 
registered their condemnation of the policies and positions that 
some of the governments are still taking, particularly the 
governments of the Western alliance under the leadership of the 
United States regarding the economic embargo imposed on Iraq and 
their continued pressure on the Security Council to prevent its 
taking another serious look at its decisions (in accordance with 
which the economic embargo was imposed) with the goal of 
eliminating them or abolishing them completely in order to end 
the justifications for them. They also expressed their 
astonishment at the size of the damage that touched the family 
life of the Iraqi family and social relationships in general as 
a result of the loss of infants and children and heads of large 
families due to a deficiency of food and medicine, as the number 
of deaths among children demonstrate and according to the 
official statistics accompanying the documents presented in the 
conference, and the psychological suffering and grief arising 
from that. 
  Part of the conference was dedicated to the Muslim, 
Christian, and Sabean religious men. This session was opened on 
7 February. Dr. Ibrahim Zaid al-Kilaani was chosen to head this 
session. A group of religious men representing the Christian and 
Mandean Sabean religions and all their sects in Iraq and the 
Arab countries, traveling from Islamic and foreign countries, 
spoke. They all expressed their agreement that the procedure 
that imposes the blockade on the Iraqi people is illegitimate 
because the divine books do not allow starving people or killing 
them unjustly, or humiliating them, abusing their generosity, or 
distinguishing between them and their fellow nationalities 
because of race, religion, language, or color. They cited in 
their studies and their contributions texts from the Holy Koran 
and from the Old or New Testaments or the sayings of the 
prophets that urge human beings to have love for their human 
brothers and [to practice] brotherliness among the sons of the 
human race and prevent humanity's oppression of its human 
brothers, whether in their life, their money, their power or 
their faith. They all, without exception, criticized the tyranny 
of America and its oppression of those peoples and governments 
of the world that refuse to subject their will to the will of 
the United States Government. This is what they are undertaking 
against the people and the leadership of faithful and struggling 
Iraq that practices brotherliness among the religions and 
respects all religions on the principle that all the faithful 
are brothers. Likewise, they registered their condemnation of 
war crimes that America and its allies have committed against 
the long-suffering and fighting people of Iraq. 
  The speakers and participants made sure to extend greetings 
to the great people of Iraq and their leader and symbol of their 
solidarity, President Commander-in-Chief Saddam Husayn, who 
endures, along with his people of Iraq, all this injury because 
of refusing to follow the wish of foreign powers and, in 
particular, his rejection of the imperialist American control 
over the destinies and riches of the Arab nation. This injury is 
a result also of his rejection of [the United States'] devotion 
to humiliating the countries of the South and causing them to 
miss the opportunity to achieve advancement and growth and 
mastery of science and technology, intending to maintain their 
backwardness and exclusion from opportunities for growth and to 
put obstacles in front of them by the tyrannical power that it 
possesses and the ability to pressure, based on this power. 
  Likewise, all the participants made sure to express their 
pleasure with the Iraqi miracle of constructing, building, and 
restoring, by its own abundant capabilities and by total 
dependence on itself, what the war destroyed. They considered 
the experience of Iraq in confronting the destructive effects of 
the war that the United States and its allies launched against 
them, in spite of the blockade [already] imposed on it, an 
unrivaled example to be followed, in addition to its being an 
indication of the vitality of the Arab nation, its 
steadfastness, and its capacity for confrontation [of problems] 
and endurance. 
  Before the end of the conference's business, in the session 
just before the concluding one, the participants decided to form 
three drafting committees, for each of the three main issues 
that were discussed to make recommendations concerning each of 
the three issues in light of the working papers and 
participants' contributions. The three committees met on the 
evening of the 27th in the south hall of the al-Rashid hotel in 
which the proceedings of this conference are taking place 
jointly with their curriculum. They noticed that most of the 
participants' suggestions were primarily founded on the ideas 
that the international law experts' paper mentioned. Since these 
suggestions were interconnected, the drafting committees 
considered the arrangement among themselves in order to prevent 
repetition, and they found that the participants in the 
conference decided unanimously on the following joint 
recommendations: 
  1. The issuance of statements of affliction and a verdict of 
guilty expressing the participants' disapproval of the war 
crimes and violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law caused by the blockade on Iraq. No legal or 
legitimate justification is found that permits the United States 
and its allies to impose this kind of tyrannical blockade and to 
continue to impose it in spite of the human tragedy that has 
been caused by it. It is considered a crime against humanity 
that is worthy of a verdict of guilty and of consequences and of 
setting in motion the rules of international responsibility that 
are appropriate because they are a basis for Iraq to demand just 
and comprehensive compensation for the damage caused by the 
violations of international humanitarian law and the adjoining 
laws of war, as a result of enemy war-like actions. 
  2. The demand and urging of the human rights organizations 
and societies working in the legal, political, and religious 
fields to undertake individual and collective efforts to make 
known in their countries the war's and blockade's crimes and to 
pressure their governments and build international public 
opinion to demand a lifting of the blockade imposed on the Iraqi 
people. The existence of this method will bring all the peoples 
eager for their independence and their sovereignty face to face 
with it. It is practiced now against the people of Iraq with 
severity and is practiced in differing degrees against other 
countries in the Third World as a means of political pressure on 
the political organizations that do not defer to the wishes of 
the robbery of the United States of America and its allies. 
  3. The call of the legal and people's nongovernmental 
organizations for the issuing of publications and periodicals 
and undertaking active media efforts that disclose to public 
opinion in their countries the size of the material and 
significant human damage that has touched the people of Iraq and 
the accomplishments that their effort and struggle have built 
over decades. These media efforts should also make clear the 
dimensions and effects of the blockade and the lack of 
legitimacy of its contining. The dimensions and effects of its 
being imposed in this arbitrary way--which is rejected by the 
general human conscience--and that it shamefully violates the 
rules of international humanitarian law should also be made 
clear. The legal experts' paper should be authorized as a basis 
for this movement and working towards spreading it. 
  4. The call for the accounting of the people responsible for 
the war crimes that were committed against the people of Iraq as 
a result of the significant violations of the allied Western 
states' war operations led by the United States of America and, 
in particular, the political and military leaders that gave the 
orders to bomb inhabited shelters and bury alive Iraqi soldiers 
in their places, to attack civilian centers and residential 
concentrations, to launch blind attacks and not take the 
necessary precautions to guard against civilian casualties, and 
to practice a type of crime of continuous, collective 
annihilation resulting from the insistence on continuing to 
impose the blockade in a way that expresses its imposers' 
contempt for the simplest human values. These violations are 
also witnessed in the leaders' lack of mindfulness of the human 
casualties that befell the Iraqi people, especially with respect 
to the deaths of children as a result of the deficiency in food 
or loss of medicine and as a result of the United States' and 
its allies' declaration as states devoid of divine religions. 
These religions reject unequivocally what they undertook in 
using inhuman methods that the divine laws do not consent to, by 
a blockade in medicines and food imposed on the people of Iraq. 
Usually, that is a groundless criminal action against God and 
against humanity. 
  5. The undertaking of an effective and influential action 
towards the United Nations directly, its specialized agencies 
and their centers and offices in all the states, without 
exception, by way of memoranda, meetings, and the expression of 
objection to their negativity towards what the people of Iraq 
have endured as a result of the blockade and the creation of the 
economic embargo, which was based on the decisions of the 
Security Council. It has lost all the groundless justifications 
that it was based on. The powers active in the United Nations 
system began to use the agencies of the international 
organization to execute their illegitimate policies at the 
expense of honor, bread, freedom, and human rights in the 
countries that oppose procedures of this kind, as a result of 
the United States' pressure on the international organizations 
because its uniqueness or isolation as a single power 
controlling the international system. 
  6. The revelation and exposure of the double standard 
followed in international politics and the exploitation of the 
United States and its allies of human rights as a means of 
political pressure or for encouraging divisive tendencies, 
threatening the sovereignty of states, and working towards their 
crumbling on ancestral or denominational grounds. Also, assuring 
the exposure of the sabotaging role that the United States 
undertakes in the international system's present situation and 
exposing the Zionist influences that push the United States in 
this direction. 
  7. The formation of committees from the nongovernmental Arab 
and international organizations to undertake voluntary work that 
aims toward making clear the justice of the issue of the Iraqi 
people on the condition that the Arab organizations carry the 
responsibility for pursuing the implementation of this 
suggestion and they outline and put in place the methods of 
planning and pursuit among themselves. 
  8. Working toward the arrangement of an international day of 
solidarity with Iraq in its ordeal, including a general strike 
or any other method that expresses effective solidarity with the 
people of Iraq and its leadership, with the vocational and labor 
unions, and the other nongovernmental organizations arranging it 
and mixing conferences and festivities with it. 
  9. The declaration of rejection of discrimination in the 
treatment of human rights issues and the exposure of the evil 
intentions that the United States has striven to fulfill against 
Iraq through the exploitation of this issue for the sake of 
fabricating justifications for the continuance of the blockade, 
and its expansion and exploitation in taking possession of 
Iraq's sovereignty and the unity of its lands by impeding Iraq's 
practice of its sovereignty and imposing blockade zones in its 
north and its south, which is considered a scandalous 
interference in its internal affairs that patently violates 
Paragraph 7, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, being 
inconsistent with the right to self-determination of the sole 
Iraqi people and their right to choose their political and 
economic system without mandate or decree or foreign 
interference reminiscent of decayed imperialist methods. 
  In conclusion, it is appropriate to mention that the 
participants in the international conference, concerning the war 
crimes and violations of the United States and its allies 
against human rights in Iraq, concluded the business of their 
international conference after ratifying the concluding report 
and approving the recommendations and statements of the verdict 
of guilty attached to this report in the closing session, which 
was held in the hall of the al-Rashid Hotel with the attendance 
of all the participants, at 1900, Tuesday, 8 February 1994, 
corresponding to 27 Shaban 1414 of the Hijra.

<F P=106> [Interview with visiting Christian clergy, by Mustafa Kamil; </F>
place and date not given: "Blockade Condemned by Visiting 
Christian Clergy"] 
  [Text] A delegation, which included their graces from among 
the Catholic patriarchs of some Eastern Churches, visited Iraq 
from 28 February to 6 March, at the invitation of the Ministry 
of Awqaf and Religious Affairs and his Grace Rufa'il I 
Biydawiid, the patriarch of Babil for Chaldeans and the Iraqi 
Church. This visit expressed the absolute support of these 
patriarchs for the Iraqi people in their confrontation of the 
unfair blockade that has been imposed on them. 
  ALIF BA' met a number of their graces representing the 
Eastern Catholic Churches who spoke to ALIF BA' about their 
visit's mission and results. 
  Patriarch Stifanus II Ghattas of the Coptic Church and St. 
Mark's missionary in Cairo, affirmed at the beginning of his 
talk his church's absolute support of and standing by the 
faithful Iraqi people and leadership. He said: "The visit of a 
delegation of Eastern Catholic patriarchs at this time has as a 
goal reinforcing brotherly relations and strengthening 
cooperation with and support to the Iraqi people. The visit 
further affirms the support of the Eastern Catholic Churches to 
the struggling Iraqi people in their persistent confrontation of 
the circumstances of the tyrannical economic blockade, which was 
imposed on Iraq through the use of force and arrogance by the 
unfair powers that control the world. All religions, blessed 
heavenly doctrines, international laws, and religious 
institutions condemn this blockade." 
  He further expressed his deep confidence in the capability 
of 
the Iraqi people to overcome this crisis saying: "We join the 
patient Iraqi people and the world liberals in raising our 
voices to demand the lifting of the vicious blockade so that 
Iraqis could meet their human needs." 
  His Grace Archbishop Bulus Emil Sa'adah, the deputy general 
patriarch of the Maronite Church in Lebanon, expressed his 
happiness at visiting Iraq and affirmed that this visit was one 
of support and love for the brotherly Iraqi people who have 
faith in the one God. Archbishop Sa'adah said: "In Isaiah, 
Chapter 52 tells us about this humanitarian approach when it 
states: `How great are the steps taken by those who herald 
peace, righteousness, and salvation.'" 
  He said: "The people of Iraq will overcome all suffering 
thanks to the President-leader Saddam Husayn's leadership and 
also thanks to the people's unity and solidarity as well as 
their rallying around their faithful leadership." He also 
mentioned the brotherly Lebanese people who suffered from civil 
war, yet, who, thanks to their national solidarity and unity, 
could contain and stop the war and attain peace and security. 
  Archbishop Sa'adah further said: "We pray to the One and 
Only 
God to have mercy upon the martyrs and place them into heaven as 
they have sacrificed with their scented blood and pure souls for 
the nation's pride and the people's dignity." 
  He further affirmed that: "The tyrannical course of 
injustice 
was very short-lived because this invasion of Iraq was doomed to 
fail and these vicious imperialistic plots to go with the wind; 
Iraqis would manage to reconstruct what the malicious aggressors 
have destroyed with self-help and with a speed that would call 
for admiration and impart happiness to the soul." 
  His Grace Yuhanna Butrus 18 Kasparyan from the Armenian 
Catholic Church in Lebanon saluted the Iraqi leadership, most 
importantly President Saddam Husayn, for the good care given to 
all sects and religions that enabled them to practice their 
rites and rituals freely and securely. 
  He described the continued imposition of the blockade on the 
Iraqi people, men and women, of all ethnic groups, religions and 
sects, as an outrageous violation of human rights and a vicious 
aggression on heavenly legislation and God's commandments, both 
of which call for respecting and revering humans and working 
seriously for their comfort and happiness. 
  His Grace Patriarch Mishal al-Sabbah from the Jerusalem 
Latin 
Church in Jordan prayed to the Almighty God to lift the 
injustice and tyranny that the Iraqi people suffer because of 
the continued imposition of the worst blockade in human history, 
which has been imposed on 20 million people including the 
elderly and the children, the sick, and the healthy. 
  He called upon all philanthropic organizations as well as on 
those peace-loving personalities who support people's freedom 
and their right to a secure and dignified life, to do their 
utmost in order to put pressure on the governments of the great 
nations, the United Nations and the Security Council, in order 
to immediately and completely lift all kinds of sanctions, so 
that the Iraqi people could be provided with all their basic 
needs. 
  His Grace George al-Murr, the Amman Archbishop for the Royal 
Roman Catholic Church, described the crime that the forces of 
the evil thirty-nation alliance committed against al-'Amiriyah 
shelter as the most atrocious incident that he had ever 
witnessed. In this incident, people were killed because of a 
deliberate crime; innocent souls were delivered up to God in 
order to complain about the injustice of humans to each other so 
that this would represent a loud cry of outrage and protest 
against the barbarism and aggression as well as against 
aggression and violence. 
  As for the Assyrian Church in Lebanon, His Grace Mikha'il 
al-Jamil, the deputy patriarch general, in response to the 
wicked people's barbarism and aggression, described the 
rehabilitation achievements, specially in the areas of 
construction and development, as a real victory for the values 
of justice, goodness and peace. He said: God Above has blessed 
the Iraqi efforts, be it those of the Iraqi people or that of 
its leadership; God has granted these struggling and patient 
people the will and capability to reconstruct all that the 
aggressor destroyed in the most atrocious aggression against 
civilization and development; we are very glad to have seen 
these achievements. 
  He further expressed his confidence in the capability of the 
great Iraqi people to overcome all calamities and difficulties 
because they have an enlightened leadership that has deep faith 
and a strong relentless will. The Iraqis also had access to an 
accumulation of inherited culture dating back to more than 6,000 
years. 
  His Holiness Father Sannun Andrawus, member of the 
delegation's secretariat, director of the Voice of Love radio 
station, and the public relations official, said: "Since the end 
of war and the silencing of canons, the cultural and 
intellectual struggle started because the Arab world currently 
faces a media struggle. It is, therefore, that the 
responsibility of the media delegation, which comprises 20 
persons representing 10 press agencies and radio and television 
stations, is to portray the sad situation caused by the 
continued unjust blockade imposed on the Iraqi people. Heavenly 
religions as well as the laws and customs of civilization could 
not understand the rationale of this state of affairs and human 
history has not known the like of it. By portraying this 
picture, the media delegation hopes that the international 
conscience could feel--however slightly--this great people's 
suffering."

  [Text] The Iraqi Cabinet follows up all that the press 
publishes about issues dealing with citizens. The Interior 
Ministry is one of the active ministries with regard to finding 
solutions to many of the issues dealing with citizens that are 
published in the press. Many people follow up on TV the interior 
minister's, Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan, weekly meeting with 
citizens, because this meeting is proof that the official is 
seeking the truth and exposes it--in its entirety--extremely 
frankly to citizens. In addition, the Interior minister's 
willingness to listen to citizens encourages them to tell him 
the whole truth without reluctance or fear. We would like to 
thank the Cabinet for commenting on the article about the 
absence of competition, which was published on 20 February 1994. 
The Cabinet requested the Interior Ministry's views and comments 
about the article. Following is the response that the Cabinet 
received from the Interior Ministry and a copy that the ministry 
sent us, while requesting our comments about its second 
paragraph. The response states that the prices of sweet 
potatoes, rose because of the increased demand for them during 
the month of Ramadan and the decline of production during the 
fall season. Sweet potato prices rose both before and after 
Ramadan. This season's production is more than that of the last 
season; prices for the last season did not reach more than half 
those for this season. In spite of the fact that growers tried 
to keep sweet potatoes in the ground as long as possible, there 
is plenty of supply in markets this season. This fact reinforces 
our statement. We also affirm that there are hundreds of trucks 
loaded with sweet potatoes waiting at al-'Alawi so that sellers 
could speculate on prices. The reason the high price reached 40 
dinars per kilogram is that, although sweet potatoes have been 
available in markets, so far, the Ministry of Agriculture has 
not yet fixed their price. 
  To the Cabinet Secretariat: 
  Please accept the ministry's best regards... 
  Referring to your correspondence M/2136 of 22 February 1994, 
we would like to make the following remarks: 
  1. The ministry's responsible department continues to 
monitor 
and follow up all factors that may impact on the easy flow of 
exposed goods. As a result of this monitoring, a large number of 
violators are apprehended daily in the different distribution 
centers and subjected to the required legal procedures. For 
example, during the two months of January and February 1994, 
4,079 violators were apprehended. 
  2. The article referred to sweet potato prices in the 
domestic markets. It should be indicated that prices for sweet 
potatoes have not yet been fixed, therefore, the prices rose 
because of both the greater demand for sweet potatoes during the 
month of Ramadan and the decrease in the production of the fall 
season. The statement in the article referring to the hundreds 
of loaded trucks at al-'Alawi awaiting the highest prices 
possible is not a precise one, because prices of sweet potatoes 
in the domestic market are subject to the mechanism of supply 
and demand. 
  3. There are a few major reasons for the fact that grocery 
stores do not adhere to the prices fixed for goods such as sweet 
potatoes and cauliflower. One of the reasons is that grocery 
stores are distributed over large geographical areas. Baghdad is 
a case in point where grocery stores are to be found on all 
streets--big and small. Another reason is that Baghdad's 
distribution centers work around the clock. A third reason is 
that citizens do not cooperate, and many of them are not aware 
of the prices of goods, which are not made public by the media. 
  We would also like to indicate that the Economics Department 
held some meetings with representatives of sales offices and 
grocery store owners to enlighten them and indicated to them the 
necessity of adhering to fixed prices as this matter concerns 
citizens' daily food. We are also monitoring those producers who 
are not selling their products at al-'Alawi; legal procedures 
such as impounding, confiscating goods, imposing fines, and 
closing sales offices have been taken against violators. This is 
for your information, with our appreciation. 
  Watban Ibrahim al-Hasan 
  Interior Minister

<F P=106> [Article by Jawad al-Ha'iri, an Iraqi writer living in </F>
Britain: "Exiled Opposition and Exiled Peoples"] 
  [Text] The Iraqi opposition is one of a number of other 
Arab and Middle Eastern opposition movements that have in recent 
years emigrated en masse from their homelands to exile. This has 
occurred within the framework of an unfamiliar experience. 
Within this experience, opposition members leave their countries 
in numbers amounting to millions to use countries in the 
diaspora as new working arenas for their political activity in 
an endeavor to perpetuate the bridges of communication with 
their peoples inside the homeland and to mobilize these peoples 
in the direction of the goals that these opposition movements 
seek. An exception is the Turkish condition and the early 
Kurdish mass emigration resulting from the national fusion 
policy embraced by the new state in the wake of the fall of the 
Ottoman caliphate. 
  Mass emigration to flee the homeland under the pressure of 
various factors is something that was experienced by the people 
of East Europe during the Stalinist era prior to and after World 
War II. Despite the curtain lowered around those countries, they 
witnessed numerous mass escape attempts throughout nearly 
one-half century. Border stations surrounding those countries 
saw a flood of refugees who, with the passage of time, came to 
form ethnic minorities exceeding hundreds of thousands in their 
new homelands. 
  Prior to the sixth and seventh decades [of the 1900s], the 
Middle East did not see the rise of totalitarian regimes similar 
to the regimes seen now. This does not mean that the area's 
countries have not tried their luck with certain despotic 
regimes. Rather, these countries have perhaps abounded with 
examples of military and non-military individualistic and 
despotic regimes. But more often than not, they were 
temperamental and superficial regimes. 
  Opposition to those regimes emerged and was often conducted 
peacefully, despite the persecution and oppression that 
accompanied that opposition. But that persecution and oppression 
were within the bounds of the bearable and one could withstand 
them. This is why opposition movements and their supporters, and 
even ordinary citizens, did not consider emigration to the 
outside world. Many of those movements were known for their 
attachment to their homelands and for not having a prior history 
of emigration and expatriation, excluding some individual cases 
of banishment, which was used as a maximum punishment against 
some active opposition elements who were deported from their 
countries. Many are the stories about the handfuls of soil that 
those deportees took with them as a reminder keeping them 
company in their exile. 
  But at a time when most of the world's political regimes 
moved in the direction of openness, of spreading a democratic 
climate, and of respect for man's freedom and rights, the 
tendencies toward totalitarian rule have grown stronger in the 
past two decades in the Middle East region and the Arab 
homeland. It is as if these two regions want to establish 
themselves as the alternative to the failed [totalitarian] 
experience in East Europe. This is why contentment with power 
from above is no longer the distinguishing mark of these 
regimes' activity. Rather, some of these regimes have turned 
into brutally suppressive regimes that are not reluctant to 
embrace the scorched land policy at the first confrontation with 
their peoples. 
  Since 1968 and under the shadow of this tendency and of the 
death machine that has been hysterically devouring any citizen 
who stands in its way, Iraq's politicized and unpoliticized 
citizens have been compelled to wage a bloody and rarely-matched 
struggle in the region in an attempt to confront the barbaric 
tide coming from within. They have made thousands of sacrifices. 
But with every sacrifice made, the regime's lust for predation 
grew stronger and stronger. In the face of this unbearable 
pressure, a way had to be found to deal with this regime. Thus, 
mass emigration and escape, plus the coercive expulsions 
practiced by the regime itself, became some sort of self-defense 
against total and inevitable annihilation. For nearly 20 years, 
new numbers have been added daily to an emigration that the 
Iraqis have not wanted and that they have never before 
experienced in their lives. 
  The Iraqi people have been divided into those who are exiled 
inside their homeland and those exiled outside it, shedding hot 
tears for kinsmen who have survived. From exile, the crowds are 
trying to organize themselves within political frameworks, some 
of which are an extension of what has existed at home, and to 
coordinate joint efforts with the movement at home in order to 
besiege and shatter the regime. But a positive circumstance has 
developed in the Iraqi opposition's political and field reality 
through the deliverance of that part of the homeland that has 
been liberated from the regime's control. This part has turned 
into a base that embraces the opposition movement's new 
political framework, which bears the name of the Iraqi National 
Congress [INC] and which includes influential Arab and Kurdish 
organizations and cadres. Thus, the beginning of the process of 
a counter political emigration to this part of the homeland has 
been created. With the new experiment gaining more strength day 
after day despite all obstacles placed in its way, the 
justifications for continued dealing with opposition action from 
abroad are weakening day after day and may reach the point where 
all excuses cited for staying away from home will be poor 
excuses lacking all objective foundations. However, there is no 
harm in reviewing some perils, which some forces cite to justify 
this position [of staying away from the liberated Kurdistan]: 
  First, the incompatibility of these forces' positions with 
the INC program and plan and, consequently, these forces' 
development of a different political position that reaches the 
point of condemnation at times. Assuming that this faction's 
position is sound, this should not be a reason for these forces 
to refrain from going to a part of the homeland that is not 
under the regime's control. If they believe that there are 
foreign forces that have a role in creating this reality, then 
do they prefer that this reality melt away and that, 
consequently, the province return to the regime's control? Or is 
it better to move to this base and to try to contribute to 
correcting any correctable negative tendencies and pitfalls? 
  Second, some influential figures justify the presence of 
this 
vast number of leaders and cadres outside the homeland by saying 
that they have inside the homeland enough leaders and cadres to 
meet the needs of the action according to the circumstances of 
the phase. It is very difficult to prove the soundness of these 
statements for a very simple reason, namely that the indicator 
of qualitative movement against the regime was at its peak at 
the end of the Iraq-Iran war. This shows that numerous factions 
preferred at the time to cling to the land, to seek its 
protection, and to face dangers rather than emigrate to move 
beyond the regime's reach. Thus, we have seen the emergence of a 
strange condition in the struggle against the regime. When the 
regime was strong and supported by several regional and 
international forces, resistance by these factions was stiffer 
and more effective. The numerous qualitative and distinctive 
operations that were staged in Baghdad and its suburbs at the 
time are an indication that it was possible to penetrate the 
regime's red lines, despite this regime's brutality and 
strength. But for the past three years, and excluding the major 
uprising of March 1991--an uprising which nobody may claim as 
his own--we have seen clearly how this kind of operation has 
diminished and how it has retreated deep into the marshlands and 
to the surrounding areas in the south. The qualitative 
operations have turned into hit-and-run operations to which the 
regime has become accustomed. These operations pose no strategic 
threat to this regime, considering that they have turned into 
intermittent and disorganized diversionary operations lacking a 
unified command and a precise strategic goal. However, this fact 
does not negate the unique spirit of heroism displayed by those 
unknown fighters in the south's marshlands and cities. 
  Third, there is a fact whose revelation will change nothing 
about it, namely that the regime prefers, perhaps even 
encourages, the presence and continuation of some sort of 
limited and calculated resistance in the southern and 
southeastern sectors of Iraq, i.e., those sectors whose 
extensions spill into Iran in some cases. The regime's objective 
is to continue to disseminate the allegations it has been 
making, and it continues to make, namely that the 
post-revolution Iran is responsible for nurturing and fanning 
the fires of this condition. 
  I have cited these justifications regarding the reservations 
expressed on operating from the liberated areas of the Iraqi 
Kurdistan so as to get to the common problems that the 
opposition movement in exile generally encounters and which can 
be summed as follows: 
  1. In today's word, talk about total independence, whether 
political or economic, and at times even cultural, has become a 
figment of the imagination. If regimes themselves cannot 
establish for themselves in today's word an independent entity 
in the true, not the propaganda, sense of the word, then it 
behooves political opposition movements not to envision 
themselves in a position that allows them complete freedom of 
movement and decisionmaking. The Iraqi opposition, which is 
pressured and besieged, is certainly compelled to soften its 
political rhetoric and vision in a way that befits this or that 
regional or international party, depending on the intellectual, 
operational, and geographic background from which the 
organization concerned proceeds. 
  This dilemma from which the Iraqi opposition suffers is 
nothing new. A party seeking asylum is always supposed to 
observe the rules of asylum. However, the problem arises when 
the objectives of the regional or international power clash with 
the legitimate national aspirations of this or that opposition 
faction. This problem influences the momentum and efficiency of 
the joint and unified action of the entire movement negatively. 
But when the possibilities of action from a liberated part of 
the homeland materialize, action under the umbrella of this or 
that foreign party is not so much a must as it is insistence on 
tying affairs in a way that serves the interests of those 
foreign parties. 
  2. What has become known about opposition from exile is that 
leaders well known to the masses assume leadership of this 
opposition's struggle and direct it according to the given facts 
of the domestic situation because it is impossible for such 
leaders to perform this role from inside the homeland. Because 
of the black fascist situation prevailing in Iraq, those who 
lead the political and organizational action are not the only 
ones who have emigrated. Rather, they have been accompanied by 
an immense mass exodus. The problem is that many of the 
emigrants have been turned by their new circumstances and by the 
activities of the parties and movements surrounding them into 
politicized cadres that burden the leaderships and block their 
path to deliberate, calm, and responsible consideration. This 
condition has forced many of these leaders into confused and 
hesitant positions whose aim is to please and appease these 
cadres. Consequently, political action in exile has largely 
turned into confused and distorted action. 
  3. The more positive and important aspect in the exiled 
opposition's movements and activities is the role they play to 
expose the regime and show its ugly face through information 
confirmed with figures and facts received from home. This aspect 
is then embodied in the political moves they make to reap the 
fruits of the impact of this information on the positions of the 
world's various governments and peoples toward the struggle. 
This is why a unified rhetoric in the external propaganda is 
necessary, even a must. But because of the political positions 
of some opposition elements abroad, this propaganda rhetoric has 
become pale and contradictory, and it has begun to undermine the 
results sought from it. 
  4. Despite the displays put up by some of those who are 
abroad, the opposition in exile continues to be a ghost 
opposition in which the serious mixes with the farcical, the 
true with the false, thus making it easy for the enemy to 
infiltrate it and, at times, to change its direction in ways 
that serve his purposes. Opposition at home is the sincere, 
serious, and real opposition. 
  5. Prolonged years in exile often transform opposition 
gradually into a state of addiction. Consequently, affairs are 
tackled with chatter, oneupmanship, and competition for social 
status. The longer the regime survives, the more duped some 
opposition elements become. Such a condition constitutes a 
negative phenomenon for Iraq's future, because the phase that 
will follow the regime's fall needs a positive modern mentality. 
  6. An opposition in exile that is aware of its 
responsibility 
is an opposition capable of establishing definite and organized 
daily operational contact with its people at home, constantly 
supplying them with all the requirements of military resistance, 
both mobilizational and financial. This opposition is never 
contented with the strategy of selling words. 
  The experience of the March 1991 uprising proved the 
complete 
opposite of the above. All sectors at home moved forth. But the 
distance between them and the leaders in exile was very great 
and the latter could not catch up with the uprising in order to 
perform the role they had drafted. 
  Finally, if the opposition in exile enjoys its stay, and if 
it stays where it is for a lengthy time, it turns into a 
desperate opposition. Fascist regimes do not care if all their 
adversaries emigrate, as long as they remain safe from these 
adversaries. These regimes do not care what names these 
organizations give themselves. 
  Totalitarian regimes have contributed to creating 
opposition-in-exile movements and, consequently, peoples in 
exile. The process of devoiding homelands can be stopped only if 
democracy and respect for the citizen are followed as a path to 
achieve political and social justice.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Umar Jastanih: "Saudi Territory Has Large </F>
Reserves of Mineral Deposits"] 
  [Text] Mr. Muhammad Dahlawi [name as transliterated], 
deputy assistant for mining investments in the Saudi Ministry of 
Petroleum and Mineral Resources, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, 
said that Saudi territory has considerable reserves of deposits 
of many minerals and that geological survey work is still being 
carried out after initial studies gave evidence of the existence 
of many industrial and non-industrial minerals in various parts 
of Saudi Arabia. 
  He added that, during the next phase, there will be further 
development of the previous exploratory studies that will focus 
on some minerals such as gold. Initial exploratory studies have 
shown evidence of the existence of some 800 gold deposit areas 
in Saudi Arabia. Concluding studies concerning two other 
projects are also expected to be completed soon. The first of 
these is the project dealing with the exploitation of aluminum 
bauxite, the initial costs of which are estimated at about $45 
million and the production capacity of which would be in excess 
of 100 million tons. The second project deals with the 
exploitation of zinc, along the lines of [other such] projects 
recently submitted for approval. 
  He said that the initial geological survey studies have 
indicated the existence of some rare minerals, and that studies 
dealing with these minerals would require specialized 
exploratory operations in order to show evidence of the 
existence of mineral ores in a form that can be beneficially 
exploited. 
  The General Directorate for Mineral Resources has already 
put 
out 11 publications dealing with the minerals that have been 
discovered in Saudi territory, some of which have already been 
exploited and some of which soon will be exploited commercially. 
These publications contain complete information concerning 
mineral ore reserves--where they are located, their uses, the 
nations that produce them, and their prices on the international 
market. The Saudi Directorate for Mineral Resources started 
putting out these publications in March of 1989. It started with 
magnesite (MgCO3), then continued with kaolin, gold, phosphate, 
limestone, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), copper, chiseled and 
decorative stones, zinc, glass sand, silica sand (SiO2), and 
gypsum. 
  Recently the directorate published a complete atlas dealing 
with industrial minerals in Saudi territory and distributed it 
to both Saudi and foreign companies interested in mining 
projects. 
  Saudi Arabia's objective in doing this is to encourage the 
private sector (domestic) to embark on large-scale mining 
investments, and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources 
is taking part in the furnishing of economic feasibility studies 
for many of the projects that are being submitted for approval 
for commercial exploitation. 
<H5>  Iron and Phosphate Projects </H5>
  According to Saudi officials, there is a trend toward 
completing the base of the mining industry and achieving more 
development in Saudi Arabia during the coming years by means of 
various mining projects. 
  According to Dahlawi, two iron and phosphate projects were 
recently submitted for approval after economic feasibility 
studies concerning them were completed. Companies that will bid 
for the iron project will first study the feasibility studies 
undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources which 
present investors with a number of options. The first of these 
involves the construction of a plant for the production of iron 
balls on the Red Sea coast, with a production capacity of up to 
2.2 million tons, and which will cost $550 million. The second 
option involves the construction of a plant for producing 4 
million tons, which would cost $750 million. The third option 
would involve the construction of a plant to produce 3 million 
tons that would cost $600 million. 
  He pointed out that the economic feasibility studies 
undertaken by the Directorate for Mineral Resources have already 
determined which markets will take the final mineral ore 
product, which would be extracted and used in direct reduction 
plants that would utilize the latest modern technology available 
in the world both in the Arab world and in the nations of East 
Asia. 
  It is a known fact that Saudi Arabia currently imports more 
than 4 million tons of iron from Sweden, Brazil, and some other 
countries, the total value of which is between $50 and $52 per 
ton. 
  Dahlawi, during the interview, brought up the subject of the 
talks that were held between the Directorate of Mineral 
Resources and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund (SIDF) and 
said that the latter is prepared to offer loans to investors for 
the mining industry projects currently being submitted for 
approval. 
  He went on to say: "Everything having to do with the loans 
will be the subject of a detailed discussion between the Fund 
bank [SIDF] and the company that undertakes the project." 
  As we know, SIDF participates in almost all industrial 
projects in Saudi Arabia whose total value is at least SR400 
million. 
  Dahlawi expects a good response on the part of some 
international firms to join with Saudi partners in investing in 
the exploitation of iron, especially in view of the existence of 
markets for the sale of the final product. He said that Wadi 
al-Sawawin's production of iron meets the requirements of Saudi 
Arabia and the Gulf nations combined and saves about 60 percent 
of the import bill for iron ore for Saudi Arabia alone.

<F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Shihab: "Al-Zamil Emphasizes Need for </F>
Conservation of Electricity Consumption in Saudi Arabia"] 
  [Text] The Saudi minister of industry and electricity, 
Engineer 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, emphasized the need for 
conservation of electric power consumption in Saudi Arabia. In 
this regard, he called upon government organizations, especially 
companies, in addition to citizens and [foreign] residents, to 
respond to the need to conserve the utilization of electrical 
apparatuses. 
  Al-Zamil, in a meeting with journalists the day before 
yesterday after he signed a contract with the Middle East 
Engineering and Development Corporation dealing with expanding 
the Tabuk power plant, said that the total amount of electricity 
consumed in Saudi Arabia last year was 15,000 megawatts, whereas 
the total amount produced was 18,000 megawatts, with 2,500 
megawatts being produced by desalinization plants on the Red Sea 
and the Persian Gulf. 
  The minister emphasized that the abundance in the 
electricity 
produced does not mean that there is an abundance of electricity 
available for all areas of the country. He indicated that 
electricity production and utilization differ from area to area 
and that "this is why there remains an urgent need to conserve 
consumption, especially in the areas where the demand is 
particularly heavy." 
<H5>  Wasteful Consumption </H5>
  He said: "There is at least a 20 percent waste in 
consumption." In this regard, he said that the ministry will 
cooperate with the General Electricity Organization to implement 
an integrated program for the conservation of power consumption, 
in accordance with measures that are in effect in various 
nations of the world. 
  Al-Zamil expects that, during the next three months, a 
contract will be signed for constructing the ninth power plant, 
between Riyadh and al-Qasim, which will serve the central area 
of the country in addition to the capital city of Riyadh. He 
said that the bids submitted by the companies are being studied 
right now. 
  Sources expect the General Electric Corporation to play a 
role in the construction of the new plant. The lowest bid for 
the construction of the plant was 3 billion riyals [SR] ($800 
million). 
  In addition to this, he announced plans for the expansion of 
power plants in the following cities in the northern area: 
al-Jawf, 'Ar'ar, Rafha, and al-Qurayyat. In this regard, he said 
that one of the options being considered in this sector was the 
possibility of setting up a unified power company in this area. 
  The Saudi minister of industry and electricity, together 
with 
Engineer Mahmud Tibah, the head of the General Electricity 
Organization, signed a contract for the expansion of the Tabuk 
power plant with Mr. 'Abdallah al-'Utayshan [name as 
transliterated], chairman of the board of the Middle East 
Engineering and Development Company, Ltd. (MEEDCO). The value of 
the contract, which is to be implemented within 24 months, is 
SR230 million. 
<H5>  Expansion Details </H5>
  Al-Zamil mentioned that the contract includes the 
construction of two power units having a total capacity of 120 
megawatts. The contract also includes provision of all the other 
requirements pertaining to technical support, spare parts, and 
maintenance. Also included is the mechanical [engineering] work 
pertaining to the fuel system, fire fighting, the compressed air 
system, and the necessary mechanical hoisting apparatuses. 
Likewise, the contract includes the electrical [engineering] 
work pertaining to the main transformers and generators, the 
civil [engineering] work pertaining to expansion and laying out 
of roads, a water purification system, cable lines, and also the 
training of Saudi technical engineers and an insurance engineer 
for the project. 
  He said that the contract was one of the important things 
being done in the northern area (Tabuk), in view of the steady 
increase in the work being undertaken as a result of the 
industrial and agricultural development and population increase 
taking place in the area. 
  MEEDCO, which won the contract, was founded in 1978 with a 
capital of SR10 million. The chairman of the board, 'Abdallah 
al-'Utayshan, contributed 51 percent of this amount, and 49 
percent was furnished by the South Korean firm Hyundai. 
  The company began its activity in the field of construction 
by implementing the Ministry of Defense's housing project in the 
Tabuk area. Then the company switched over to the field of 
electricity. At the present time it is implementing contracts 
for the expansion of three substations that are part of the 
Riyadh electrical system, in addition to a contract involving 
the Bani Malik Station in the area of Jizan.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abdallah Kuraydim: "Inauguration of New 'Asir </F>
Provincial Government Building in Abha"] 
  [Text] Prince Nayif Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the Saudi minister 
of interior, the day before yesterday (Thursday) inaugurated the 
new provincial government building of the province of 'Asir, and 
those present during the inauguration included his deputy, 
Prince Amad Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, and Prince Khalid al-Faysal, 
governor of the province of 'Asir. 
  Construction of the building cost more than 140 million 
Saudi 
riyals [SR] ($37 million) and took six months, and the building 
occupies a total area of 36,000 square meters. It consists of 
six towers that are connected to a series of roads and other 
buildings. Each tower is six stories high, and the building has 
parking areas and is equipped with the latest in communications 
technology, office equipment, computers, and informational 
technology. The building is built in the style typical of the 
province of 'Asir and its capital city Abha. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT 
has learned that the estimated total expenditures for the 
building and its annexes was about SR310 million. The total was 
this high because it was necessary to compensate the owners of 
the real estate adjacent to the building, to prepare the ground 
surrounding this area, and to increase the surrounding planted 
green-belt area. 
  The office of Engineer Ziyad Zaydan supervised the 
implementation of the project and worked on its architectural 
designs. The firm that implemented the project was the al- 
Buraydi Commercial and Contracting Corporation, and the 
project's cost was SR80 million. The inside furnishing and 
equipping of the building was done by the two firms Bayt 
al-Riyad and Kawkash [name as transliterated], which were paid 
SR40 million for the job. The design of the building 
incorporated a new architectural concept that is in keeping with 
Saudi Arabia's distinctive heritage and that has the ability to 
develop and change from the architectural point of view in 
accordance with future needs. 
  The complex consists of two parts--the provincial government 
building and the building housing the principal auditorium for 
meetings. The latter contains amphitheaters planted with thick 
greenery in the form of a series of rising planted 
amphitheaters, and it also has a reflecting pool and several 
water fountains. 
  The total area of the province of 'Asir is 40,000 square km, 
and the province has a total of about 700,000 inhabitants. The 
city of Abha is located on a mountainous highland near the Red 
Sea in the southern part of Saudi Arabia, it has a distinctive 
climate, it is small and is characterized by a quiet life, and 
it has many beautiful natural views. Abha is a rather 
densely-packed city, is located in a saucer-shaped elevation, 
and is surrounded by mountains and a green area, and there are 
many winding streets and roads both inside the city and on the 
sides of the highland area.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Ghaffar Mustafa: "Roads in Mecca Cost 8 </F>
Billion Riyals"] 
  [Text] So far the total cost of the construction of roads 
in Mecca has been more than 8 billion Saudi riyals [SR], and 
about SR50 million is spent on them every year for maintenance. 
All parts of Mecca have been linked to each other, and all parts 
of Saudi Arabia have been linked to Mecca, in order to make it 
easy to reach and depart from the Holy Mosque and to enable 
pilgrims to reach any area of Mecca and the holy places in a 
short time. In addition, the capacity of the roads has been 
increased. Furthermore, the network of tunnels that currently 
exists is about 28 km long, and it includes 53 tunnels of 
differents widths and lengths. 
  In addition to the work done on completing the blueprint for 
organizing the road network and the completion of the second 
phase of the circular road for the southeastern area of the holy 
places, a circular road has been constructed that is 7 km long 
and 30 meters wide and a connecting road to the highway between 
Mecca and al-Kura has also been built. Implementation is also 
taking place of the second phase of connecting Roads 1, 6, 7, 
and 8 between the new circular road and the old circular road, 
in addition to implementation of the construction of eight 
parking areas for rest stops for pilgrim buses and locations for 
establishments that deal with pilgrims. 
  Another thing taking place now is the leveling and 
preparation of an area for two parking areas north of the King 
Faysal Bridge and construction of the second circular road which 
is 8.5 km long. This road goes through 14 double tunnels and has 
seven high points for regulating traffic between the circular 
road and the main streets leading to and from the Holy Mosque 
and the holy places. In al-Muzdalifah there are four model 
parking areas, of which three are along the King 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Road and one along Highway 5. 
  The Secretariat of the City of Mecca says that its services 
extend to providing lighting for the streets and roads in Muna, 
al-Muzdalifah, and 'Arafat, and that the lighting network gets 
its electricity from a network of underground cables. 
  The secretariat also says that this network is continuing to 
be expanded in order that its capacity be increased in 
accordance with the field studies and programs dealing with the 
needs of each area. In addition to the services of a road 
network and a network of lighting for the streets and roads, the 
secretariat also provides pilgrims with means of making it 
easier for them to participate in the pilgrimage rites and other 
services, including the construction of a number of 
slaughterhouses for the slaughter of sacrificial animals. This 
slaughtering is forbidden in the tents and along the streets and 
roads because of the concern about maintaining public health and 
cleanliness and in order to make sure that the slaughtering is 
done in a way that corresponds to Islamic law and meets health 
standards. There are five such slaughterhouses, all of which 
have places for slaughtering both by machine and by hand, 
refrigerators to keep the meat fresh, and living accommodations 
for the persons who work there. The total capacity of the 
slaughterhouses is between 800,000 and 1 million head of sheep 
and cattle.

  [Text] People from both the Northern and Southern Yemeni 
communities in Saudi Arabia who are there either to work or are 
on a visit have gathered around radios and TV sets in an attempt 
to learn about the fighting that is going on in their country 
between the two sides. 
  Although the satellite channels have played a major role in 
broadcasting news about the events taking place in Yemen, radios 
still remain the basic means by which they get their news and 
information. The reason for this is that a great many of the 
Yemenis living in Saudi Arabia cannot afford to buy satellite 
dishes. However, in some of the Yemeni households where there 
are satellite dishes, people have gathered around TV sets to 
follow firsthand what is being broadcast by the satellite 
channels. 
  Likewise, some owners of commercial stores have said that 
there has been a noticeable increase in the demand for radio 
sets. 
  Both Yemeni residents and visitors are worried because 
telephone communications and trips by air have been cut off, and 
these constitute the only means by which they can properly 
assess what is going on in their country. 
  An official in the Yemeni Airlines Company said: "Large 
numbers of Yemenis are coming to us and asking whether or not 
there is a flight going to, or coming from, Yemen. Also, some 
passengers are having their names put on the reservation list in 
anticipation of flights starting up." 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT met with some of the Yemeni residents and 
conducted interviews with them in order to get their reactions 
concerning what their thoughts have been since the war broke out 
in Yemen. 'Abd Muhammad Hasan said: "I have been working in 
Saudi Arabia for three years. My wife and children visited me 
during the last month of Ramadan. Although our area is 400 miles 
from Sanaa, the fact that telephone connections have been cut 
off and flights and trips by sea have been stopped means that 
the situation has deteriorated." 
  He added: "I thought of going along with my five colleagues 
who returned to Yemen via the land route. But my health didn't 
allow me to go, and I need to get well. I don't know if my 
colleagues, who left Jeddah on Thursday, will be able to enter 
Yemen or whether or not this door will also be closed." He ended 
by saying: "What can I say? There is no power and no strength 
save in God." 
<H5>  I Can't Think Straight </H5>
  Ahmad Yislam [name as transliterated] said: "Worry is 
killing 
me. I can't think straight and I can't concentrate. My brother, 
mother, father, and child are all there. What can I do? I don't 
know anything after the telephone connections were cut off and 
trips by air and by sea stopped going to Yemen. Now all we can 
do is listen to the news and follow the events and developments 
of the war over the TV that one of our colleagues has in his 
house after we finish work--which helps us to forget things for 
a while. But our hearts and our minds are in Yemen. Really all 
we can do is to humbly pray that God will put out the fire of 
this war, have people come to their senses, and contain the 
crisis before Yemen pays the price of the disturbances and 
losses which are more costly than disputes over authority and 
other interests." 
<H5>  The Radio Is My Friend </H5>
  'Ali Muhammad Sa'id says: "My only friend is my radio. That 
is how I find out what is going on in Yemen, although I am not 
convinced of the truth of everything that I hear over the radio 
concerning the causes of the war. Yemen is too big to have 
someone try to divide it or exploit it for personal reasons. 
Whatever the disputes may be, they should not end up being 
fought with bullets, bombs, and missiles. The only place where 
brothers should wage their disputes is the negotiating table. 
This is the only place where these circumstances and tensions 
can come to an end without bloodshed. After the helping hands of 
our Arab brothers have been extended, the Yemenis themselves 
have to step in and stop this bloodshed, which is increasing 
every day because of the outbreak of the conflict between the 
two sides." He went on to say: "I am waiting to go back to 
Yemen, when flights resume, so that I can be reassured about my 
family and relatives--or whoever is still alive among them, I 
should say. We pray to God that justice will be done and Yemen 
be preserved." 
<H5>  Rise in Prices and Lack of Security </H5>
  Salim Nasir says: "All I know is that there has been an 
increase in prices in Yemen and one is no longer safe there, and 
this makes life difficult. We heard promises that there would be 
an improvement in the situation and that those who were corrupt 
and committed fraud with the wealth of the nation would be 
punished. But all of these resolutions remained merely pieces of 
paper until the war broke out. We don't know what the extent of 
the effects of this war will be if it is not snuffed out right 
away. Certain considerations, fears, and results must be taken 
into account before it is too late. All we can do is to wait and 
see what tomorrow will bring us in terms of events." 
<H5>  First and Last Group </H5>
  In reply to a question about what his feelings were, 
Muhammad 
'Abdallah said: "We have been the first and last group of 
pilgrims to arrive in Saudi Arabia since the airports in Yemen 
were bombarded. We are praying to God here in the Holy Mosque 
[in Mecca] and in the Prophet's Mosque [in Medina] that this war 
will come to an end and that all the parties start a dialogue 
and be guided by reason." 
  After a moment of reflection, he added: "My wife and I left 
our children in Yemen. We have tried to call them on the phone, 
but have not been successful. Telephone communications have been 
cut. All we can do is follow the news, wait, and pray." 
  In addition to this, a fight broke out between a number of 
Northern and Southern Yemenis after an argument between the two 
sides concerning the situation in their country and the reasons 
for the conflict and the war. A number of people were injured, 
and it ended only when a number of older people intervened to 
stop the fight and to say that any victory by one of the two 
sides in Yemen would be a loss for everyone, since the killers 
and the persons killed, and the victors and the losers, are all 
Yemenis. For this reason, it is in the interests of Yemen that 
this war, which is being waged on its territory, be stopped.

  [Text] London--AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT asked a Yemeni writer and 
intellectual to record his view of events. He contributed the 
following bitterly satiric article reviewing the war of words 
that went on from the beginning of the crisis until its eruption 
in total war. 
  What does unity have to do with a sandwich? 
  You have a right to ask this question at this particular 
time: for the Yemen crisis is at its most critical juncture, and 
the battle is at its fiercest between proponents of unity and 
supporters of tashtir ("slicing in half"). The latter 
term, which has engaged the attention of Yemeni politics for a 
long time, comes from the world of the Classical Arabic 
sandwich. The term is one of the achievements of the 
Arabic Language Academy, which decided once upon a time to 
Arabicize the foreign word sandwich and came up with 
the phrase,"top slice and bottom slice with a filling in 
between" [al-shatir wa al-mashtur wa al-kamakh 
baynahuma]." 
  The phrase never caught on anywhere in the Arab world, 
except 
in Yemen, where the blundering of the shatir [a pun 
on three meanings: "divider," "shrewd person," and "withdrawer"] 
and the injustice to the mashtur ["that which has 
been divided"] have brought the country to the verge of 
tashtir ["cutting in half"]; and this at a time when 
unity and secession have come to mean the same thing to grieving 
citizens, who go to sleep with an old promise and wake up with a 
new lie. 
  Apart from the term tashtir ["cutting in half"], 
all the terms of the Yemen crisis invite deep philosophic 
reflection. Everyone is fighting to defend "legitimacy," which 
in the South means "party legitimacy," and in the North means 
"tribal legitimacy." The only term stranger than "legitimacy" is 
the phrase "foreign fingers" [i.e., foreign influences], which 
shifts meaning from day to day. Sometimes it refers to 
legitimate aid; at other times it refers to objectionable 
interventions. To these terminological marvels you may add the 
phrase "national dialogue." Everywhere else it means the need to 
use the tongue; here, however, the politicians love to dialogue 
with cannons, swords, tanks, and land, naval, and air weapons. 
  As for the tanks that fueled the latest battles, observers 
have been at a loss about how to categorize the Southern 
brigades located in the North and the Northern brigades located 
in the South. Were these forces positioned to defend unity, or 
were they hostages in the hands of two sides who deal in every 
coin except good faith? 
  Although military thinking says that tanks require a large 
crew, technicians, and supplies, here tanks were like trucks 
running aimlessly at the whim of their drivers, who drove them 
until the fuel ran out and then went looking for someone to tow 
them to the nearest station. If no one could be found, the 
driver would go off to his fate and leave the tank to its fate 
of becoming an ideal storage bin for fodder. 
  Something laughable in our country--how many things there 
are 
in it to make you laugh until you cry!--is that the military 
brigade is no better organized than the tank. Theoretically a 
brigade consists of about 10,000 persons--except here, where a 
brigade consists of a few hundred, sometimes a few dozen. They 
swear allegiance to the state, but in a pinch they follow 
instructions emanating from the province or tribe. The purpose 
of the Pledge and Accord Document, the most recent Yemeni term 
before the fighting, was to prevent militarization of the 
crisis. Now the document is fulfilling precisely the opposite 
role, accelerating the factors that would make for a military 
resolution. It is as if its signatories had promised and agreed 
not to implement a single letter of the document; which they 
indeed have done, in accordance with the principles of our way 
of promising and agreeing--especially when the agreements and 
promises are under Jordanian sponsorship. 
  Although the concept of "association of ideas" 
[tada'iyat] belongs to the novel, particularly the 
stream-of-consciousness novel represented by Virginia Woolf, the 
Yemen crisis, which has used up almost all the technical terms 
of literature, has also commandeered this term among others. The 
term tada'iyat is now being used in the sense of 
"developments." The term is being so used by all the parties, 
who fight with one hand and with the other hand draft 
communiques demanding a halt to military and media 
tada'iyat. What is so beautiful about Yemeni feuds is 
their polished style. Your foe charges you with lying, cheating, 
thievery, and treason, but he does not forget to add the title 
"brother" to your respected name, so that you become "Brother 
Cheater," or "Brother Traitor," or any other kind of brother 
plus epithet. None of these epithets has anything to do with the 
concept of brotherhood, which the fraternal enemies in Yemen 
have worn out in ways never imagined by the Brothers Karamazov 
or by Dostoyevsky, who could add 10 volumes to his immortal 
novel merely by paying a short visit to the land of fraternal 
enemies who never tire of talking about the concept of the rule 
of law--in a country desperately seeking law.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "American Logic"] </F>
  [Text] That nothing much has changed in Indo-American 
relations after Mr Strobe Talbott's and Ms Robin Raphel's recent 
efforts to soothe ruffled Indian feathers is evident from a 
recent unambiguous enunciation of the U.S. line towards this 
country by Mr Lee Hamilton, chairman of the foreign affairs 
committee of the U.S. House of Representatives. The senator is 
partly right in saying that the current "acrimony and 
bitterness" are the result of the Indian belief that a 
Democratic administration should be more friendly towards India 
than a Republican one. If, as he says, things have not quite 
worked out that way, it is presumably because Mr Clinton's 
ignorance about the complexities of politics in this part of the 
world has been compounded by the strange conviction in 
Washington apparently shared by both the Democrats and the 
Republicans that only the American viewpoint is valid. 
Otherwise, it is difficult to follow the logic of some of Mr 
Hamilton's observations. For instance, he wants India not to 
deploy the Prithvi missile as this will lead to greater tensions 
in South Asia, but it does not strike him that Pakistan's 
acquisition of more F-16s may do the same. Referring to India's 
contention that its security concerns relate to China as well, 
Mr Hamilton argues that Prithvi can be used only against 
Pakistan. But against whom will the F-16s, the M-11s and the 
Hatf missiles be used? 
  The real thrust of Mr Hamilton's remarks is evident, 
however, 
in his gratuitous advice to India that it should aspire for a 
close partnership with the United States. His concept of 
partnership, however, is akin to what Ayub Khan once found hard 
to accept, as is clear from the title of his autobiography, 
Friends, Not Masters. With disarming candour, the 
good senator wants India to accept the fact that the United 
States today is the only superpower, for if it does not, "an 
antagonistic America would pose a substantial obstacle to Indian 
aspirations." Clearly, the principle of agreeing to disagree 
which is central to all democracies is currently at a discount 
in Washington. Mr Hamilton has also spelt out how the United 
States will bring India into line (for a close partnership, of 
course): "The U.S. support for concessional financing from the 
World Bank and the IMF is crucial if India hopes to address the 
economic and social needs of the people." The threat is obvious 
and even tends to confirm the long-standing Leftist belief that 
the two organisations are mere extensions of the American 
foreign policy establishment. But perhaps the most extraordinary 
part of Mr Hamilton's speech was his explanation for the current 
calm in Punjab--the ruthlessness of the Indian security forces 
"in suppressing the insurgency." His belief, however, that the 
people of Punjab may still be dissatisfied underlines a touching 
concern for popular feelings that was not much in evidence when 
the United States backed any number of brutal dictators ranging 
from Syngman Rhee, Ferdinand Marcos and Lon Nol to the Shah of 
Iran, Papa Doc and Baby Doc and General Pinochet.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 3--The much-awaited project to 
upgrade the MiG-21 BIS [multirole] is likely to be undertaken 
with Russian assistance, the Minister of State for Defence, Mr 
Mallikarjun, indicated in the Rajya Sabha today. The 
negotiations with the Russians were over and a letter of intent 
was being issued, he said. 
  The Minister offered scanty details of the project in which 
both the Israelis and the United States expressed an interest. 
Mr Mallikarjun said that with modern avionics and other 
equipment, the re-vamped MiG-21 would once again assume its role 
as a frontline combat aircraft. 
  Mr Mallikarjun strongly defended the short-listing of the 
British Aerospace Hawk and the French 
Alphajet would meet the Indian Air Force's 
requirement of an Advanced Jet Trainer. 
  The Minister, however, did not mention the time-frame within 
which the final decision would be taken. He said the negotiating 
committee would seek to obtain the AJTs [Advanced Jet Trainer] 
at the most favourable price. 
  He further said that the negotiations were being conducted 
on 
the basis of bids submitted in March 1992. He declined to 
comment on the allegation of a Rs 1,000-crore [rupees] bribe 
that had been made by Mr G.G. Swell (M.P.). He said he "totally 
disagrees with the respectable, honourable M.P." 
  Prior to the short-listing of the Hawk and 
Alphajet, Mr Mallikarjun said, the IAF [Indian Air 
Force] had evaluated all other options available, in 1985. The 
evaluation had included studies on Spanish, German, Italian, 
U.S., and Czech aircraft. None of them met the prescribed Air 
Staff Requirement. 
  The Russian MiG-80, which was scheduled to be unvailed this 
year, was still on the drawing board. Nobody could say how long 
it would take for commercial production to commence, nor were 
its capabilities established. In contrast the Hawk 
and Alphajet were "proven" and used in the training 
role by several forces. 
  Discussing modernization plans for the Army, he said that 
the 
T-72 tank, which had now been totally indigenized, would be 
upgraded. While most of it would involve the use of 
sophisticated Indian equipment, some items might have to be 
imported. 
  The Minister spoke of frigates, destroyers, and off-shore 
patrol vessels being produced in domestic shipyards for the 
Navy, and said the time had come to plan construction programmes 
for the future since shipbuilding takes time. 
  However, the proposals for an indigenous replacement of the 
defunct INS [Indian Navy Ship] Vikrant and the continuation of 
the HDW [Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft] sub-marine project, at 
Mazagon Docks, were not mentioned. 
  Mr Mallikarjun said that in future the third and fourth line 
servicing of the carrier-based Sea Harrier fighters would be 
done in the country, instead of sending them abroad for major 
servicing. 
  Development of infrastructures and Operation Seabird to set 
up a base at Karwar and the Naval Academy, at Ezhimala in 
Kerala, was continuing. 
  While several members had described the budgetary outlay of 
Rs 23,000 crores as inadequate, and he conceded that it was not 
much more than the revised estimates of Defence expenditure for 
1993-94, Mr Mallikarjun drew attention to the resource 
constraint and said: "We have to meet the needs with whatever is 
available." 
  The Minister agreed that the Research and Development 
Organisation had a key role to play but rejected the view that 
the Rs 80-crore reduction in its budgetary provision, for 
capital expenditure, had meant an overall slash in its funding. 
That amount had been re-appropriated under the revenue 
expenditure head. 
  Noting that members had compared India's Defence expenditure 
of 2.5 percent of GDP with the 7 percent of Pakistan, the 
Minister declared that the percentage of GDP was not a proper 
index, nor was there any point in trying to match anybody else. 
India's allocations were "need-based," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Yamuna Dutt Vaishnav Ashok: India and Tibet's </F>
Long Journey Together] 
  [Text] Our Constitution expects each citizen to be 
acquainted with the name of Tibet, the gold reserves of its 
Kailash Mansarover area, and its language, science, tradition 
and history in connection with its being an ancient center of 
world culture. A parliamentarian should certainly have known, 
much more than an ordinary citizen, that the sage Purushottam 
Das Tandon gave a statement in the Lok Sabha nearly 28 years 
ago. This statement was given in the context of Nehru's request 
to obtain approval of an announcement to grant to Zhou Enlai the 
highways built by the government of British India, the 
transportation and communication system from Leh to Lhasa, and 
the right of India to freely trade in Tibet. The reply given by 
the Indian government in Parliament during the three-day 
international Parliamentary conference on Tibet now held in 
Delhi, was the complete opposite of the statement of Mr. Tandon. 
(See Lok Sabha narrative - May, 1956.) 
  The description in the Indian Constitution of the 
fundamental 
duties of the country's citizens is given in paragraph 51-k of 
chapter 4 as follows: 
  "It is the fundamental duty of every citizen of India to 
develop in the populace the scientific viewpoint, humanism and a 
feeling of purifying investigation." At the root of this duty 
we find that branch of the mountain routes described by Panini 
which go from Leh to Lhasa, on which India's Shak traders 
traveled through mountain passes to enter the present Kumaon 
These passes are approximately 18,000 feet above sea level. It 
was extremely terrifying to cross these passes by sliding down 
the ice of contiguous mountain peaks. Shak traders passing 
through the "snaky roads", their sheep and cows loaded with 
goods from Central Asia, tied spears and sticks cross-wise 
across their bodies to avoid being buried in the invisible 
cracks of ice-boulders. Therefore these routes were also called 
"spear paths". 
  History tells us that in 640 AD, in this country called 
Kirat Mandal, ruled the Khus (Shak) King Chan Gampo (Sog Chang 
Gampo). He married the daughter of India's Khus King Anshu Verma 
and for her established Shivalaya near Kailash Mansarovar. He 
also married China's princess and established Pota la Vihar in 
the east in Rasa (now Lhasa). A descendant of this king in 747 
AD invited Acharya Padmasambhav from Nalanda University. At his 
command, he built Buddhist monastries in his country in the 
Magadh architectural style. During the next 400 years Buddhist 
monastries and abbeys were built in all of Central Asia. 
  When Marco Polo from Venice reached the court of Mongolia's 
ruler, the ruler Kubbla Khan could not decide which religion he 
should follow. He requested the Polo brothers to bring with them 
preachers of the Christian religion in their second visit to 
Mongolia. He also asked them to bring some holy oil from the 
temple in Jerusalem. The two Christian missionaries with whom 
Polo had started out, did not have the courage to travel beyond 
Syria, and returned home. Thus Kubbla Khan took initiation into 
the Buddhist religion, and endeavored to make the Kailash 
Mansarovar area a center of Buddhist religion, similar to the 
center that then Rome was of the Christian religion. It was 
made compulsory for the religious king of the Buddhist country 
(Ta Bodh) to remain a bachelor and a teetotaller. The word Ta 
Bodh of the Italavi language was called Tibate by Jesuit priests 
and became Tibbat (Tibet) in English. 
  The age-old commerce of the northern routes, spread over all 
three continents of the ancient world, was at its peak during 
the Mughal era. The Mughals had great allegiance and devotion 
towards Central Asia, especially Samarkand. At the time of 
Akbar, Samarkand was the learning center of the Arab world. Many 
philosophers and teachers in his court were from Samarkand. 
Babar was born in Turkemanistan and was enthroned in Samarkand 
at the age of twelve. Babar's ancestor Taimurlung had made the 
capitals and markets located on the ancient Central Asian trade 
routes the target of his barbarism. In 1393 A.D. he had looted 
the grand city of the Caliphs, modern Iraq's capital Baghdad, 
and had captured Moscow in the north. Only three years later he 
had destroyed Delhi. Then in 1401 A.D., he had destroyed western 
Asia's largest trade center Damascus, and had defeated Egypt's 
armies. Having killed thousands there, he had reached Ankara in 
1403 AD. At that time the ancient northern trade route had 
become Taimurlung's military route. 
  At the time of Kumaon's king Udyot Chand (1678-1699 AD), the 
border of the Kumaon kingdom reached the western shore of the 
Karnali river. In the north it bordered Taklakot and in the 
south reached the Karnali river flowing between Bahraich and 
Kheeri districts. Indians were allowed to freely visit Kailash 
Mansarovar. Border traders roamed Central Asia's markets for six 
months without interference, and arranged for their own safety 
on trade routes. 
  The British government, patient for 45 years, felt the 
imminent loss of Tibet. Finally the British government sent a 
group of representatives from the Indian border towards Tibet, 
but they were stopped 24 kilometers inside Tibet. Then Lord 
Curzon, under the leadership of Sir Francis Young Husbandsman, 
sent armed forces to attack Lhasa. In March 1904 the British 
army murdered 700 unarmed Tibetans. In August of the same year, 
Sir Young reached Lhasa. He did not find any representatives 
from Russia there. A fine of 7.5 million rupees was imposed on 
Tibet by the British government. A treaty was signed with the 
condition that its Chumbi valley area would be under British 
control for 74 years for the collection of this fine, so that 
100,000 rupees could be collected every year. 
  The British home department reached an agreement with Russia 
and also sent a proposal to China in 1907 that if China would 
pay the fine imposed on Lhasa, the British would give up their 
right to Chumbi valley. Thus China got an invaluable 
opportunity to gain control over all of Tibet for 7.2 million 
rupees. According to the agreement of 1906, the British 
government obtained full freedom to trade with Tibet. There are 
more than a dozen mountain passes from Almora and Garhwal 
districts running towards Tibet. Free trade commenced through 
all of these. Indian British soldiers were deployed for the 
protection of these routes. Military outposts were built from 
place to place. Mail collectors and mule operators who carried 
mail to India, began to travel to and from Almora. This 
arrangement would continue for nearly six months every year. 
After that soldiers were appointed at every outpost in Tibet to 
protect the government treasury. British trade agents would stay 
in Gabyang for a few days, then come to Calcutta, and after 1911 
to Delhi. In the protection of trade routes, terrible accidents 
would sometimes occur due to sudden floods. In 1947, in the 
flood of Myantsay, hundreds of Indian soldiers were killed along 
with Captain Nagar and Major Nagpal. After the flood subsided 
Subedar Budh Singh dug up from the river sand 100,000 rupees 
that had been swept away when the government treasury building 
was destroyed. Almost 150 bodies were found in the dry river bed 
when the flood waters receded. After the cash and other valuable 
military goods were handed over to the Indian government, 
Subedar Budh Singh and the entire mountain populace were proud 
of the responsibility for its supervision. When Nehru handed 
over the entire administrative estate to Zhou Enlai, the 
northern mountain dwellers were deeply hurt.

<F P=106> [Article by K.K. Katyal: "Kashmiris Fed Up With Militancy, </F>
Feel Envoys"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, May 2. 
  The third group of Ambassadors, which visited Jammu and 
Kashmir last week, returned with the dominant impression that 
the people there were fed up with the prolonged dislocation of 
their daily lives and craved for an early return of normality. 
  Though the Huriyat leaders in Srinagar did not see the 
Ambassadors -- ten of them, mostly from the Muslim and Latin 
American countries -- they were able to get a complete picture 
of the situation there. They were briefed by the State Governor, 
Gen. (Retd.) K.V. Krishna Rao, and various others like the 
former Chief Minister, Dr. Farooq Abdullah, the representative 
of human rights organisation and spokesmen of the migrants. 
During their stay in Jammu, they saw two Huriyat leaders, Mr. 
Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ahmed Shah Gilani, in jail. 
  Contrary to the account given by official sources here, the 
group's assessment was a mixed affair, but New Delhi has no 
reason to be unhappy about it. The Ambassadors found the Kashmir 
problem highly complex which needed to be resolved politically, 
not through force. The situation did not admit of any 
"unsettling" solution, according to them. They did not find any 
indication of the political process which, as claimed by the 
Government, had been initiated, of late. At the same time, they 
found evidence of external backing to militancy (the source of 
this support, obviously, is the Pakistan-occupied areas of 
Kashmir, but the group preferred not to identify it). 
  Ordinary citizens of the State, both in the valley and in 
Jammu, according to the group's assessment, would like the 
violence to end and the situation brought back to normal. They 
complained of having been squeezed by the two-sided violence, by 
the militants, on the one hand, and the security forces, on the 
other -- and would like the situation to settle soon. 
  The visiting Envoys were impressed by the representatives of 
the migrants, belonging to both the communities, who narrated 
their tales of woe. At another level, Mr. Lone and Mr. Gilani 
took an extreme line, of the type followed by the militants. 
Also, they complained of the treatment meted out to them in the 
jail, especially objecting that they had been clubbed with 
ordinary convicts. 
<H5>  No Cause for Complaint </H5>
  Confirming the accounts earlier emanating from Srinagar, the 
Ambassadors found no cause for complaint about the arrangements 
for their trip. They did not blame the authorities for the 
episode at Srinagar where the leaders of Huriyat insisted on the 
Ambassadors coming to its office in the downtown area, rejecting 
the suggestions for a meeting either at the tourist complex or 
at the residence of the Mir Wahiz, one of the leading lights of 
the organisation, near Nagin Lake. 
  The two groups of the Delhi-based Ambassadors who had gone 
to 
the State earlier, had found the Huriyat leaders speaking with 
several voices. This umbrella organisation of 33 groups, big and 
small, conveyed differing views on the modalities for resolving 
the present deadlock and putting an end to violence -- and 
though extreme sentiments were articulated by most of them, some 
others were either non-committal or chose to prevaricate, and 
avoided taking extreme postures. 
  To claim, as official sources did today, that the 
impressions 
of the Envoys represented a change in the attitude of their 
Governments towards India is a case of inverted logic. As a 
matter of fact, the observations of the visiting Ambassadors 
would help their Governments to see the situation in a proper 
perspective instead of being influenced by Pakistan's propaganda.

<F P=106> [Article by F.J. Khergamvala] </F>
  [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 4. 
  Iran's Ambassador in India has issued a statement which is 
an 
indictment of New Delhi for its conduct of the mission of 
diplomats in New Delhi to Jammu and Kashmir [J &amp; K]. It 
accuses 
India of "misleading the diplomatic group" and not "fulfilling 
the terms under which these envoys were taken to J &amp; K." 
  Radio Teheran broadcast the text of a statement issued by 
the 
Iranian News Agency on Monday, May 2. The Ambassador, Mr. Raza 
Sheikhattar seems to have given his statement immediately after 
the return to New Delhi of the 11 diplomats who had visited J 
&amp; 
K. After initial reluctance he had joined this mission. As would 
be seen from the text, it is extremely unusual for a diplomat 
stationed in another country to use such strong words publicly 
against the Government to which he is accredited. In India, at 
the very least the move should come as a considerable 
embarrassment to policy planners and other observers who have 
maintained the pretence, since the Human Rights meeting in 
Geneva, that Teheran's neutrality tilts towards India and that 
bilateral ties are all hunky-dory. 
  "The itinerary of the eight Muslim and three Latin American 
countries diplomats never materialised," said the envoy. "Since 
I was promised that I could meet anyone I asked and go anywhere 
I desired and even hire taxis if I wanted to and in 
consideration of the Indian Government's policies of clarifying 
the situation in J &amp; K, I accepted the offer to go there. The 
Government of India had also promised to arrange the meeting 
between the delegation (of envoys) and leaders of the Hurriyat 
Conference. This was written in our itinerary, unfortunately it 
did not happen. The Government of India under the pretext of 
security problems and despite the fact that the Hurriyat 
Conference had guaranteed our security, refused to agree with 
the meeting place proposed by the Hurriyat Conference," the 
statement added. 
<H5>  No Official Reaction </H5>
  In India, actions of powers above the Ministry of External 
Affairs [MEA] and some in the MEA have led Iran to believe that 
Teheran being India's only rescue act in the Islamic world, New 
Delhi must do its bidding. It is perhaps not too well known that 
the Indian Ambassador in Teheran is being prematurely 
transferred, at the behest of Teheran, for allegedly ruffling 
some feathers. However, nothing that he is known to have said or 
done that compares with the public censure issued by the Iranian 
Ambassador in New Delhi. In terms of content, it is not known if 
others in the diplomatic group share his views but it is most 
unlikely they would issue public reports. Extraordinarily, in 
contrast to what may have transpired if the Pakistani Ambassador 
had said this, the Indian spokesman has not reacted at all to 
the Iranian envoy's statement. Objectively, it seems difficult 
to believe that the envoy would continue to enjoy confidence in 
the MEA, especially when one reads what he said further. 
  His statement added: "The diplomats wanted to meet with 
ordinary people but the Government officials decided that this 
was not possible in circumstances of a strike called by the 
Hurriyat Conference. The envoys' request to travel to Sopore and 
Bijbehara (the scene of last October's massacre) was rejected on 
security grounds. Although the provincial authorities had 
earlier agreed to the delegation meeting with representatives of 
the Srinagar people who had sustained damages, this was later 
cancelled and the reason given for it was that the Srinagar 
representatives were not too keen on holding the scheduled 
meeting. We could not pay a visit to the Hazratbal shrine 
either. When complaints were made to provincial authorities 
about the fact that facilities similar to the ones provided to 
the visiting delegations in the past were not being offered at 
this time, the envoys were told that people had protested after 
such visits and the Government was trying to avoid further 
unrest. Visiting diplomats were instead taken to the Dal Lake 
area and were provided binoculars to be able to see the shrine 
from a distance." 
<H5>  Visit Incomplete </H5>
  In conclusion, the statement attributed to Mr. Sheikhattar 
says "the Srinagar visit has been incomplete and the aim of 
clarifying the situation in Kashmir is yet to be achieved. In 
Delhi we were told that the situation in Kashmir had improved 
and we had hoped to visit large areas of the State. The 
situation is totally upside down. We hope the Government would 
in future provide suitable facilities for diplomats and fulfil 
its promises about clarification of the situation in the region." 
  Some may now question the whole idea of arranging diplomatic 
transparency in J &amp; K, but Indian diplomats, reacting to the 
Iranian view say it has been a good move and there is no need to 
throw out the baby with the bathwater. As for the envoy's 
intentions, one purpose would be to enhance its standing in 
Islamabad and with the Hurriyat Conference, the ascendant group 
in J &amp; K or with one of its factions. No doubt, such remarks 
would never have been possible had it not been for India itself 
making Iran feel it can play the key umpire's role. In any event 
the statement issued -- and neither reported in India nor 
responded to officially -- is inconsistent with the official 
level pretence about the state of relations.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 3. 
  The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao today announced 
his Government's intention to set up a National Security Council 
[NSC] which would take into account all matters that impinge on 
national security. 
  "It will not just have defence in its ambit but have a much 
wider scope than that," he said while replying to a discussion 
on the working of the Defence Ministry in the Rajya Sabha. 
  The Prime Minister said he had got the matter examined and 
"we have come to the conclusion that it should be set up." "In 
its new variegated form it will take into account all matters 
impinging on national security." 
  Mr. I.K. Gujral, JD [Janata Dal], intervened to ask if the 
NSC was any different from what had been proposed in 1990. He 
said he did not find any difference in what the Prime Minister 
had outlined and what had been proposed in 1990. 
  The Prime Minister said in 1990 it was narrow in scope and 
included only finance, home, defense. However if the member felt 
there was no difference then he could have the copyright, he 
said in a lighter vein. 
  The Prime Minister said that the security environment had 
changed very much since 1990 which necessitated a wider scope 
for the NSC. 
  Referring to the changed scenario after the end of the cold 
war, Mr. Rao said if business was as usual even after the end of 
the cold war, then it had no meaning. 
  "We have to be pragmatic about the changes ushered in by the 
end of the cold war and it required greater vigilance on the 
part of all countries particularly India and the role it had 
play, he said. [sentence as published] 
  "We cannot abandon this role," he said adding we have to 
work 
for peace and resolution of problems is going to be much easier 
than before since the end of the cold war. 
  The Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Mr. Sikander 
Bakht, said the Prime Minister's statement still did not dispel 
their misgivings at all. He said the Agrii missile programme had 
been discontinued on several occasions and he suspected this was 
due to us pressure. [sentence as published] -- PTI

  [Text] New Delhi, May 4. 
  Yielding to pressure from Opposition as well as ruling party 
members in Parliament, the Union Finance Minister, Dr. Manmohan 
Singh, has announced some more concessions for the small-scale 
sector. He, however, stuck to his stand on not to reintroduce 
general excise exemption for this sector. The reliefs were 
announced by the Minister while piloting the Finance Bill 1994 
in the Lok Sabha today. The Bill is expected to be passed on 
Friday. 
  Lower excise on vehicles catering to the rural population, a 
lower excise on split air conditioners for tourist buses, a 
reduction in customs duty on medical equipment and some changes 
in presumptive tax on transport operators are among the reliefs 
extended by the Minister for the automobile sector. Dr. Singh 
has also changed the dates for furnishing returns in the case of 
companies and non-corporate assessees. Though the Minister did 
not give the quantum of revenue, loss on account of the 
concessions, sources indicated that the loss would be marginal 
and below Rs. 50 crores. 
  He also announced the constitution of a group to collect 
district-wise data from States in order to arrive at a uniform 
national set of criteria for industrial backwardness and to 
identify districts which are extremely backward. On the basis of 
the new criteria, the question of providing tax holiday for new 
industrial units in backward districts would be considered. 
<H5>  Product-specific Exemptions </H5>
  Recounting the measures taken by him to remove the 
difficulties faced by the small sector, the Minister told the 
House that removal of the product-specific exemptions and 
extension of the general small scale industries (SSIs) scheme 
for excise concession would give the small sector a real 
competitive edge vis-a-vis the larger units. This was because 
under a general excise exemption, both the large and small units 
were treated at par whereas under excise, the small units could 
get the benefit of concessional rates. 
  Having said that, Dr. Singh went on to announce complete 
exemption from excise in the case of soap made without the aid 
of power. Similarly, umbrellas have been exempted from excise 
duty as well as corrugated boxes and cartons since these are 
mostly made in the unorganised sector. 
  For the automobile sector, the Minister has said that excise 
duty on vehicles with gross vehicle weight of less than 2,700 
kg. which was proposed to be levied at the rate of 40 per cent, 
will now attract 25 per cent duty. This has been done because 
vehicles satisfying this criterion had been designed to cater to 
the needs of rural transport and should not attract 40 per cent 
duty which is the rate for cars as well. 
  Furthermore, he said that in view of the administrative 
difficulties faced by utensil manufacturers, he was exempting 
the circles used captively in the manufacture of such utensils. 
He also proposed the extension of proforma credit of yarn duty 
to manufacturers of narrow woven fabrics as well as proforma 
credit of woollen yarn duty to woollen fabrics. On knitted and 
crocheted fabrics, he proposed a uniform duty of 10 per cent 
against the rates of 5, 10 or 20 per cent depending on value. 
  On split air conditioners, Dr. Singh had proposed in his 
Budget a shift from specific to ad valorem rates. He said he had 
received representations that imposition of 60 per cent ad 
valorem duty on split air conditioners for buses had resulted in 
a sharp increase in the incidence of duty and as this would go 
against the interests of the tourism industry, the ad valorem 
duty was being reduced to 30 per cent. 
  Similarly, on representations from members of Parliament, 
the 
Finance Minister has enlarged the list of imported life-saving 
medical equipment exempt from payment of customs duty. The list 
of goods attracting 15 per cent customs duty was also being 
enlarged. Spare parts for such medical equipment which attract 
15 per cent plus nil countervailing duty (CV) and 40 per cent 
with CV duty would now generally attract a uniform rate of 15 
per cent plus CV duty. (The CV will be equivalent to excise duty 
on domestic producers). Similarly, excise duty on medical 
furniture which were to attract 20 per cent duty will now 
attract 5 per cent only. Dr. Singh also promised to look into 
representations seeking enlargement of the list of life-saving 
drugs which do not attract any duty. 
  In the case of direct taxes, the Minister has reduced the 
estimated income in case of truck operators from Rs. 2,000 to 
Rs. 1,800 per truck per month for light and medium commercial 
vehicles and from Rs. 2,500 to Rs. 2,000 per truck per month in 
the case of heavy trucks. 
  In response to another demand, the Minister has now 
indicated 
that the due date for filing returns for companies would be 
November 30 instead of the earlier proposed date of October 31. 
Likewise, for non-corporate assessees who are required to get 
their accounts audited or are required to furnish an 
accountant's report in support of claims for certain deductions, 
the due date will continue to be October 31 and will not be 
changed to August 31. This has been done in view of the 
complaints that changes in dates would result in bunching and 
heavy pressure of work on the audit profession. Besides, the 
amendments would have created difficulties in the case of 
non-corporate assessees who claim deduction under Section 80 HHC 
and 80 HHD, since they are allowed to bring in the export 
proceeds in foreign exchange by September 30 and thereafter 
furnish evidence of such remittance.

  [Text] Madras, May 4. 
  Elections to town panchayats, municipalities and municipal 
corporations would be held before November this year and elected 
councils to these bodies would be formed by that month, the 
Local Administration Minister, Mr. T.M. Selvaganapathy, 
announced in the Assembly today. 
  The Minister was replying to the discussions on Bills 
seeking 
to bring the Municipalities Act in conformity with the Central 
Government's Nagarpalika Act. 
  He expressed his inability to hold the elections in the next 
three months, as the Government had to take follow-up action on 
several heads after the passage of the legislation. 
  He said the Government had to prepare the electoral rolls, 
identify the seats and posts for reservation for SC/ST 
[expansion not given] and women and frame the rules under these 
statutes. Hence it required the six months time-limit provided 
for in the Act for the holding of the elections. 
<H5>  Mayoral Poll </H5>
  With the upgradation of the municipalities of Tiruchi, 
Tirunelveli and Salem into municipal corporations, direct 
elections would be held for six posts of Mayors. Of these six 
posts, two would be reserved for women and one for SC/ST and the 
reservation would be by rotation. 
  Chairpersons of municipalities would be elected directly and 
one-third of the posts would be reserved for women. For SC/ST, 
the reservation would be on the basis of their population for 
which the 1991 census would be the base. These reserved posts 
too would go by rotation. 
  Municipalities with more than three lakhs population would 
have independent ward committees, for which suitable provisions 
had been made in the new Act, he said. 
  Mr. Selvaganapathy detailed the salient provisions of the 
Bill, and said the new statute would enable these local bodies 
to associate themselves in the planning process. 
<H5>  Turns Down Demand </H5>
  He turned down a demand that MLAs [Member of Legislative 
Assembly] and MPs [Member of Parliament] participating in these 
elected councils should have no voting right. The 74th amendment 
to the Constitution made it mandatory. Likewise election to the 
post of Mayor too had to be directly by the people under the 
Central Act, he said. 
  In the discussions, Mr. Gnanasekaran (Cong.-I) welcomed the 
mandatory election to these local bodies once in five years. He 
wanted the Government to hold elections within three months 
after the passage of the bill. 
  Mr. M. Sundardoss (Cong.-I) opposed direct election to the 
post of Mayor of municipal corporations. The reservation for 
women and SC/ST should not be by nominations, but by enabling 
these segments to win the elections through proper 
identification of the wards for them. 
  Others who participated included Mr. Deivanayagam (Cong.-I), 
Mr. O.S. Amarnath (AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam]) and Mr. V. Thambusamy (CPI-M [Communist Party of 
India-Marxist]). 
  After the Minister's reply, the Bills were passed. 
  The House also adopted after a brief discussion the Bill 
which amended the Public Property (Prevention of Damage and 
Loss) Act. 
  The new Bill provides for punishment of the persons who 
actually caused damage or loss to the private property and to 
make the political parties or communal or ethnic groups which 
organised procession, assembly, meeting, agitation, 
demonstration or other activities leading to violence also 
liable to pay compensation. 
<H5>  Authorised Officer </H5>
  Replying to the discussion on the Bill, the Leader of the 
House, Mr. V.R. Nedunchezhian, said that the Commissioner for 
Revenue Administration would be the authorised officer to whom 
the petitions for compensation should be made. 
  He also said that this legislation would itself be a 
deterrent to those indulging in violence. In the absence of this 
measure the Government would be handicapped against taking 
action against the culprits.

  [Text] Patna, May 11 -- The Bihar Chief Minister, Mr. Laloo 
Prasad Yadav, today said that the Assembly elections in the 
State would be held in January next year. The term of the 
present Assembly expires in March 1995. 
  Mr. Yadav claimed that the ruling Janata Dal and its allies 
would get two-third of the seats. 
  He expressed hope that by then the voter's identity cards, 
as 
directed by the Election Commission, would be ready. He said the 
State was prepared to spend 50 per cent of Rs 100 crores 
required for the purpose. 
  Mr. Yadav told reporters that the Vaishali Lok Sabha 
by-election was a dress rehearsal before the Assembly elections. 
He denied that there was any criticism in the party over the 
selection of the Janata Dal candidate for the by-election. He 
said, "We needed Mrs. Kishori Sinha. We did not want to take any 
risk about it". 
  He said that he wanted to dispel the charges against the Dal 
that the party was biased against the upper castes. Mrs. Sinha 
had filed her nomination as a Janata Dal candidate after 
resigning from the Congress(I). 
  Mr. Yadav said that the Congress(I) should not complain 
about 
the defection of Mrs. Sinha since the Central Government had 
survived because of defections. He quipped that Mr. Ram Lakhan 
Singh was most competent to speak on the subject. 
  The Chief Minister expressed his unhappiness, over the 
leakage of letters written by two Janata Dal M.P.s -- Mr. Nitish 
Kumar and Mr. Brishen Patel --which reached the Press before he 
received them. 
  However, he did not want to discuss the letters. He also 
refused to answer questions pertaining to Mr. Patel's criticism 
regarding his style of functioning. He described the M.P.s as 
his younger brothers. 
  But he said that the people who had been helped by him 
earlier were now speaking against him. He said that the M.P.s 
were not fit to pass such comments.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 6. 
  A Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court today initiated 
suo motu "contempt of court" proceedings against 
Acharya Giriraj Kishore, joint general secretary of the banned 
Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Mr. G.K. Mahajan, editor, printer 
and publisher of Kabardar India (Hindi weekly) and 
Mr. Ravi Thakur, reporter of the weekly for publication of 
certain statements reportedly made by Acharya Giriraj Kishore 
(on the Apex Court) in the edition of the Hindi weekly dated 
April 11 to 17. 
  The Bench, which made these orders after perusal of the 
affidavits concerned, however, said that there was no 
justification for proceeding against Mr. Vishnu Hari Dalmia, 
leader of the banned VHP. 
  The Chief Justice, Mr. M.N. Venkatachaliah, Mr. Justice A.M. 
Ahmadi, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice G.N. Ray and Mr. 
Justice S.P. Bharucha were on the Bench. 
  The Bench in today's orders said that appropriate notices 
shall be served on all the "accused" by the court registry 
fixing the next date of hearing for their personal appearance 
before the court to hear "charges" against them. 
  The Bench, adverting to publication of certain statement 
attributed to Acharya Giriraj Kishore in Indian 
Express (Delhi edition dated April 10), said that, as 
regards printer and publisher, editor and reporter of the daily 
(respondents 4, 5 and 6), it (the court) proposed to examine the 
question -- whether in the matter of a proper balance of 
fundamental right (of free speech and expression including 
"freedom of press") under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution 
on the one hand and the need to protect the authority and 
dignity of the court on the other -- it (the Bench) should 
initiate similar proceedings against these three respondents 
particularly in the light of the fact that the respondents had 
carried out the publication pertaining to "press interview" 
along with a "caveat" commenting on the "impropriety" of such 
statements followed by an editorial condemning such conduct. 
This would be examined separately. 
  The Bench appointed, Mr. Dipankar P. Gupta, 
Solicitor-General 
as a prosecutor. 
  Earlier, Mr. F.S. Nariman, senior counsel appearing for 
Indian Express, contended that "An Editor/Publisher 
does not scandalise the Court when he reports accurately and in 
good faith what public figures say in public." He also submitted 
that it was important that the "right of citizens to know" what 
public figures said in public should "not be inhibited by the 
law of contempt" so long as "what is reported is accurate and in 
good faith". 
  To balance the interest of a "free Press" and a "fair 
administration of justice", it was necessary to lay down as a 
principle flowing from Article 19 (1) (a) read with the 
provisions of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 that a publisher, 
printer and editor "do not themselves render liable for the 
criminal contempt of "scandalising" the Court where "what they 
do is merely report the public statements of a public figure, 
and where such a report is published with a caveat commenting 
upon the impropriety of such statements."

  [Text] Madras, May 6. 
  The break away DMK [Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (Dravidian 
Progressive Foundation)] led by Mr. V. Gopalsami today adopted 
the name `Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam'. 
  For its flag too, the party has retained the twin colours of 
black and red but in a way different from that of the DMK. The 
flag will have three stripes, red at the top and the bottom and 
black in the middle. 
  The party General Council which met here today endorsed the 
new name and flag and within minutes of its disclosure by the 
party's general secretary, Mr. Gopalsami, the flag sprung up in 
multitudes in and around the venue. The party Executive which 
practically sat through the whole of last night besides choosing 
the name and flag deliberated on many other current issues. 
  Ever since Mr. Gopalsami and his group broke away from the 
DMK in October last, they had been claiming that theirs was the 
real DMK and they would not part with the DMK's flag. 
  They had to change their stand following the decision of the 
Election Commission which recently gave its seal of approval to 
the group led by Mr. M. Karunanidhi and Mr. K. Anbazhagan as the 
DMK with the authority to use the `Rising Sun' symbol. 
  Mr. Gopalsami who announced the party's decisions at a news 
conference and displayed the new flag said his party had not yet 
decided on its election symbol. As the candidates of his party 
in the May 26 bye-elections were `Independents' in the reckoning 
of the Election Commission, they had to remain content for the 
present with one of the free symbols allotted to them by the 
Commission, he said. 
  The word `Marumalarchi' (Renaissance) had been appended to 
the name DMK, Mr. Gopalsami explained, because his party would 
like to take up in earnest the work left behind by the late C.N. 
Annadurai, the founder of DMK and who ceaselessly crusaded to 
bring about a renaissance in the social, cultural and literary 
fields of Tamil Nadu. In the political arena too, his party 
would like to usher in a renaissance by stamping out corruption 
and putting an end to the practice of grooming family heirs for 
political leadership, he said. 
  Mr. Gopalsami said that his group's earlier claim on the 
name 
and flag of the DMK party was a sequel to the strong sentiments 
of those who walked out of the DMK with him and their intention 
had never been to introduce `confrontationist politics' in the 
State. In fact they were the victims of violence at several 
places. With the Election Commission's pronouncement, a new name 
and a new flag had been necessitated but `we are confident that 
people will decide who represents the real DMK', he said and 
added `we will prove in course of time that we are the real DMK'. 
  The General Council of the party decided that the 
office-bearers elected at its earlier meeting held at Tiruchi in 
December last would be retained ones for the Marumalarchi 
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) also and the rules and 
regulations adopted at that meeting would govern it. 
  `Our first task in politics is to fight and throw away the 
corrupt AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam] 
Government', said Mr. Gopalsami responding to questions. 
  Asked whether he would not be further splitting the 
anti-AIADMK votes by his stand, Mr. Gopalsami said, that 
practically all sections of the people had been disillusioned 
with the performance of the AIADMK Government. The people wanted 
a change of Government and his party firmly believed that it 
could provide the alternative. 
  At the national level, he said, his party would team up with 
anti-Congress(I) forces for bringing about a powerful 
alternative to the Congress(I). He, however, excluded the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] from the list as it was communal. The 
Left parties and the Janata Dal could emerge as a strong force 
against the Congress(I), he felt. 
  He had reservations about Bahujan Samai Party led by Mr. 
Kanshi Ram, Mr. Gopalsami said. Their views on Gandhiji were not 
acceptable to his party. 
  On his attitude towards the Sri Lankan militants, he said he 
was not supporting any of these groups. His aim was that there 
should not be any violence in Tamil Nadu and if there were any 
violent acts, the law should take its course. 
  Answering a question on the revival of the sentence on the 
News Editor of Dinakaran newspaper by the Assembly, 
he said there was no magnanimity on the part of the State 
Government. His party would launch an agitation whenever press 
freedom was threatened, he said. 
  The General Council passed a number of resolutions, 
including 
one urging the State Government to revoke the sentence on the 
News Editor of Dinakaran, expedite police 
investigation and apprehend the culprits involved in the murder 
of Elumalai, party activist, and an appeal to the electorate of 
Mylapore and Perundurai to support the party's candidates in the 
bye-election.

  [Text] Madras, May 7. 
  `Believe us; we will not betray your trust' -- with this 
slogan Mr. V. Gopalsami launched his election campaign at 
Mylapore on Friday night in support of his party, the 
Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) candidate, Mr. 
(Kalaipuli) S. Dhanu. 
  Only 12 hours earlier, the name and the design of his party 
flag were finalised and announced marking his group's complete 
break with the parent organisation, the DMK which once held him 
out as its `battle sword'. 
  Mr. Gopalsami began his speech well after midnight and kept 
his sway over the audience till the end. The late C.N. Annadurai 
was sought to be projected at the venue of the meeting through 
an illuminated cutout and a huge painting which formed the 
backdrop at the dais. 
  While his attack on the AIADMK was sharp and forthright, his 
snide remarks on the DMK drew cheers from the crowd. 
  Mr. Gopalsami relied on the record of his group's conduct in 
politics in the last six months since its exit from the DMK to 
make that appeal to the electorate of Mylapore. `People should 
realise that Tamil Nadu now needs a disciplined force like 
ours', he said and shared his perception that the electoral 
verdict in Mylapore and Perundurai would decide the future of 
the State. 
  That he was keen to woo all segments of society was evident 
from the way he began his speech. He recalled the great people 
in the different sects who had made Mylapore proud and said he 
had come to the same place to seek the support of the people. 
  He branded the AIADMK Government under Ms. Jayalalitha as 
the 
most corrupt in the whole country. `We don't want gun culture; 
we don't also want suitcase culture,' he said. 
  The sizeable Brahmin population in the constituency appeared 
to have weighed with some of the speakers. 
  Mr. L. Ganesan, the theoretician for the MDMK said the word 
`Marumalarchi' (renaissance) in the party's name did not mean 
going back to the roots of the Dravidian movement and revive the 
anti-Brahmin attitude. At one point of time a movement against 
Brahmins was needed but now it was only against brahminism. 
Brahminism need not be with Brahmins alone but could be found in 
other sections of society also. The party was also not 
irreligious. 
  The candidate Mr. Dhanu himself opened the speech by 
reciting 
Sanskrit slokas and a reference to his worshipping at the temple 
before setting out to file his nomination. What, however, went 
down well with the crowd was his offer of thanks to the 67 
candidates who had arrayed themselves against him in the 
election and his homage to late T.M. Rangarajan whose death in 
an accident caused the bye-election.

<F P=106> [Article by Sakina Yusuf Khan: "Scepticism Over Sulaiman </F>
Sait's New Secular Party"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, May 1--The launching of the Indian 
National League in New Delhi last week by the former Indian 
Union Muslim League (IUML) president, Mr Ibrahim Sulaiman Sait, 
is being viewed with scepticism in political circles. 
  Political observers point out that the emergence of the new 
party is the logical culmination of the contradiction within the 
IUML which has been persisting for quite some time. Over the 
past two years Mr Sait, who had reigned supreme as the IUML 
president since 1973, seemed to his party colleagues to be a 
leader out of touch with reality. 
  The Kerala IUML's objection to Mr Sait's approach and 
politics have been articulated by the state unit president, Mr 
Thangal, from time to time. The split, observers feel, was a 
foregone conclusion after Mr Sait's replacement by Mr G.M. 
Banatwala as party president in February this year. 
  Holding the Prime Minister and the Congress responsible for 
the demolition of the Babri-masjid, Mr Sait had been insisting 
on the withdrawal of the IUML from the Congress-led coalition 
government in Kerala. 
  But IUML MLAs [members of Legislative Assembly] believe that 
snapping the alliance would be impolitic as losing the Muslim 
support would leave the Congress free to woo the majority 
community more aggressively. Besides, they argued why should 
they agree to end the marriage of convenience that provided them 
control of 65 percent of the state's budget and plum ministries, 
including industry and education. But Mr Sait who had little at 
stake in the UDF [United Democratic Front] coalition dismissed 
them as power-hungry politicians and severed his ties with the 
IUML to set up his own party. 
  In a bid to don the secular mantle, Mr Sait dropped the word 
Muslim and chose to name his party Indian National League. The 
party's professed aim is to break out of the minority cocoon and 
join the secular mainstream and fight the fascist forces gaining 
ground in the country. 
  But there are very few willing to accept Mr Sait's professed 
secularism at its face value. Especially in view of the 
inaugural charter of demands raised by his party which include 
the formation of a ministry of minority affairs at the Centre, 
reservations for Muslims in government jobs, dialogue between 
the administration and the Kashmiri people for a political 
solution, the disciplining of anti-national forces like the RSS 
[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] (organization of service to the 
nation), the inclusion of wakf land and graveyard in the Babri 
masjid site and protection of the mosques in Mathura and 
Varanasi. These have raised eyebrows in political circles and 
already cast a shadow on the nascent organisation's professed 
secular aim. 
  Says Mr Tariq Anwar of the Congress: "If Mr Sait thinks that 
he can ensure his political survival by keeping the Ayodhya 
issue alive, he is being foolish. The recent assembly elections 
in six states have proved that Muslims do not want to submit 
their destiny to religious leadership and will not follow their 
diktat." 
  According to Mr Anwar, organisations like the IUML, have 
ceased to have any relevance and if a united IUML could not 
progress beyond the backwaters of Kerala, to expect its 
decimated avatar to make an impact is being plain unrealistic. 
  While agreeing with Mr Anwar that there is no scope for a 
communal party in national politics, the Janata Dal MP [member 
of Parliament], Syed Shahabuddin, is not entirely dismissive of 
Mr Sait's new outfit. Says Mr Shahabuddin, "In so far as it is 
the launching of a secular party I welcome Mr Sait's initiative. 
But given his background, Mr Sait will have to prove his secular 
credentials to be accepted into the national mainstream which 
does not however mean that he has to stop advocating the 
legitimate causes of the Muslims. However, we must wait and 
watch the party's performance before passing any judgment on it." 
  A pertinent question being raised by critics is can a party 
whose very genesis is based on a religious issue like the Babri 
masjid be expected to follow a secular path? Mr Sait counters 
the contention vociferously. "The demand for rebuilding of the 
Babri masjid is not a religious demand. The demolition was a 
severe blow to the secular fabric of the nation. To reduce it to 
a Hindu-Muslim issue is mischievous," he says. 
  As for the other demands, Mr Sait says none of them can 
justifiably be called sectarian or communal. For instance, the 
Kashmir issue, the demand for reservation for backward sections 
of society are national and societal issues and have been raised 
by other secular parties as well from time to time. "Then why is 
it that when we raise these issues it is branded communal 
sectarian demand," he asks. 
  But as rightly pointed out by Mr Shahabuddin it is not 
IUML's 
raising these issues but its concentrating only on them in its 
inaugural convention which has raised doubts about the parties 
secular intentions. 
  But how does the former IUML patriarch propose to reconcile 
the party's professed secular ideals with the conservatism and 
fanatical outlook of the fundamentalists, who form the majority 
of Mr Sait's following? Mr Sait refutes the fact that the 
majority consists of extremists. He cites the overwhelming youth 
presence at the party's convention in Delhi last week as 
evidence of his support among the younger generation of Muslims 
which according to Mr Sait is neither fundamentalist nor 
communal.

  [Text] Amritsar, May 1--Akali politics under the `guidance' 
of the Akal Takht and influence of the Sikh clergy today took a 
new turn with the dissolution of six leading Akali Dal factions 
and formation of a new political party--the Shrimoni Akali Dal 
(Amritsar), reports UNI. 
  The new party made a "historic Amritsar declaration," 
renewing the `age old Akali' demand for the "formation of a 
separate area (state) for the Sikhs wherein the `quam' 
(community) can experience the glow of freedom and freely 
profess and propagate its religious view-points and at the same 
time uplift Punjabi culture." 
  The declaration was read out at a public rally held inside 
the Golden Temple complex after the culmination of the week-long 
Akali unity process in which all the frontline Akali factions 
barring the Akali Dal (Badal) had participated. 
  In the declaration, the Akalis speaking on the lines of the 
Anandpur Sahib resolution also demanded that India be 
re-organised into a confederation of states wherein every 
religion and community could freely profess and propagate its 
views and culture. The declaration warned that if this demand 
for bringing about changes in the Indian constitution on federal 
lines was not met then the Akali leaders would be left with no 
option but to launch a struggle for an "independent sovereign 
Sikh state." 
  The Akali Dal which were dissolved today were the Akali Dal 
(Kabul), the Mann Dal, the Manjit Dal, the Babbar Akali Dal, 
Akali Dal (Panthic) and the Talwandi Akali Dal. The Badal 
faction of the Akalis aligned with the SGPC [Shiromani Gurdwara 
Prabandhak Committee (Sikh Temple Management Committee)] chief, 
Mr Gurcharan Singh Tohra, also announced their decision to leave 
their parent body and join the SAD [Shiromani Akali Dal (Akali 
Religious Party)] (Amritsar). 
  The frontline leaders of the dissolved Akali factions who 
had 
taken part in the unity process which was started on Monday last 
under the guidance of Akali Takht acting Jathedar Prof Manjit 
Singh took a pledge to preserve and protect the interests of the 
new party. 
  In the pledge read out by Bhai Manjit Singh who had still 
yesterday headed the Manjit Dal, the Akali leaders decided to 
re-dedicate themselves for the betterment of the Sikh community 
and for achieving the proposed demand for a `separate Sikh area.' 
  Besides Bhai Manjit Singh the other leaders who took the 
pledge before the public gathering were former Punjab chief 
minister and Kabul faction leader Mr Surjit Singh Barnala, Mr 
Amrinder Singh of the Panthic Dal, Mr Simranjit Singh Mann, Mr 
Jagdev Singh Talwandi and Col Jasmer Singh of the Babbar Dal. Mr 
Barnala, who declared the formation of the new party, also 
announced to formation of a six-member committee consisting of 
the above-mentioned six leaders to run the affairs of the party. 
  The Amritsar declaration which was read out by Col. Jasmer 
Singh, former general secretary of the Babar Akali Dal soon 
after Mr Barnala finished his speech, was also greeted by the 
public. The contents of the one-page document created confusion 
for newsmen who wanted to know whether the Akalis had demanded 
an "area for the Sikhs" within the Indian union or a separate 
independent state. 
  The declaration while raising this demand castigated the 
Congress leaders, who at the time of the Indo-Pakistan partition 
had promised the then Sikh leaders a similar "independent area" 
for the Sikhs. These leaders had betrayed the Sikhs as they did 
not create such a state, Mr Jasmer Singh said while reading out 
the document. 
  The document while drawing comparisons of the political and 
social realignments world-wide said it was only in such a Sikh 
state that the interests of the minorities could be protected 
and there would be scope for the expansion of Punjabi culture. 
Both Sikhs and Punjabis could feel free to profess and propagate 
their religion and culture in this `free zone', the document 
added.

  [Text] Guwahati, May 2--The Bodo Peoples' Party has finally 
split. The president of the party, Mr Sansuma Khungur 
Bwismutiary, has been removed. 
  The 75-member Central Working Committee elected at the 
political conference of the All Bodo Students' Union at 
Debergaon near Kokrajhar in last July has been dissolved. 
  Mr Prem Singh Brahma, general secretary and the chairman of 
the Bodoland Autonomous Council has taken over the leadership of 
the party at a special conference held at Tamulpur on April 30. 
  A new Central Working Committee was constituted and the 
office bearers were named there. Expectedly, Mr Bwismutiary 
challenged the validity of these steps. 
  He described the whole exercise as "a conspiracy" hatched by 
the Assam Chief Minister, Mr Hiteswar Saikia, in collusion with 
his agents in the Bodo movement. 
  According to sources, Mr Bwismutiary will continue to lead a 
rival faction of the Bodo People's Party with the old guard, Mr 
Rabiram Brahma, as general secretary. 
  However, his position has definitely weakened since he quit 
the post of chairman of the BAC [expansion not given]. Mr 
Bwismutiary's deputy, Mr Brahma, was elevated to the post of 
chairman. 
  The power to distribute resources coupled with the backing 
of 
the Chief Minister, helped him win over support from unexpected 
quarters. 
  The split in the leadership was expected to percolate in the 
organizational spheres.

  [Text] Guwahati, May 8. 
  As expected, the internal crisis in the Bodoland People's 
Party [BPP] has further intensified. 
  The first annual conference of the BPP at Bodobazar in Bijni 
in Bongaigaon district, under the chairmanship of its president 
Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary (6-7 May), expelled Mr. 
Premsing Brahma, presently the Chief Executive Member of the 
Bodoland Autonomous Council (BAC) and General Secretary of the 
BPP, from the primary membership of the BPP. 
  At another two-day conference of the BPP, also described as 
the first annual conference, held at Tamulpar in Nalbari 
district on 29-30 April, Mr. Sansuma Khunggur Bwiswmutiary 
himself had been removed from the presidentship of the BPP and 
replaced by Mr. Premsing Brahma. 
  The Bijni conference appointed Mr. Rabiram Brahma, the 
General Secretary of the All Bodo Students' Union (ABSU) 
throughout the years of the Bodoland agitation and, who had 
recently resigned as Executive Member of the BAC, as General 
Secretary of the BPP it annulled the expulsion of Mr. Baliram 
Boro, Vice-President of the BPP, from the party, and reinstated 
him in his original position. The decision to expel Mr. Baliram 
Boro had been taken on April 18 following public criticism by 
Mr. Baliram Boro of some of the actions of Mr. Premsing Brahma 
and his supporters in the BAC, particularly disbursement of BAC 
funds. 
  According to reports available in Guwahati, the Bijni 
conference was attended by about a thousand delegates 
representing eight of the 11 district committees of the BPP. 
  On the face of it, these developments appear all too typical 
of any fledgling political party and seem to be based on 
personal rivalries and accusations of financial irregularities 
as well as frustrations over the non-implementation of the Bodo 
accord, in particular the refusal of the State Government to 
include 515 more villages (in addition to the 2,750 already 
notified) in the BAC area. However, beyond these real and 
manufactured grievances are some more fundamental issues 
touching on the "Bodo national question" that animated the 
Bodoland agitation -- issues which the Bodo accord did not even 
touch upon. 
  It is true that Mr. Hiteswar Saikia has exploited the more 
superficial of the differences among Bodo leaders with a view to 
splitting the leadership and finally marginalising the Bodo 
nationalist aspirations -- as he has done in the case of ULFA 
[United Liberation Front of Assam]. Nevertheless, such 
developments do not mean that one faction of the Bodo leadership 
is less sensitive to those more basic issues than the other or 
that one faction has compromised itself by agreeing to have a 
working relationship with Mr. Hiteswar Saikia -- the charge 
brought against Mr. Premsing Brahma by Mr. Bwiswmutiary and his 
supporters. For, whoever occupies political office in the BAC 
structure will, by definition, be tarred as a 
"collaborationist," with those excluded adopting, apparently out 
of necessity, a more nationalist posture. 
  Viewed from a broader perspective, however, there seems to 
be 
an underlying unity of perception on Bodo 'national' aspirations 
even in the midst of all these wrangles. And as these 
developments enfeeble all the organically related structures 
committed to the Bodo accord and the fulfilment of these 
aspirations within the ambit of the Indian Constitution -- the 
ABSU, the BPP and the BAC -- the only certain gainer will be the 
most extreme and explicitly secessionist of the Bodo nationalist 
structures, the Bodo Security Force, waiting in the wings to 
pick up the pieces and appropriate the Bodo movement.

  [Text] Madras, May 2. 
  The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle [ASLV]-D4 to be 
launched from Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh on May 4 
incorporates significant modifications for the rocket to achieve 
a minimum perigee of 400 km altitude, and ensure a one-year life 
for the satellite that will be placed in orbit. 
  The launch window for the ASLV, whose last developmental 
flight was a success in 1992, has been set for 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 
a.m. on Wednesday. 
  Modifications have been carried out in the ASLV-D4 in three 
areas compared to previous flight missions. Refinements have 
been done for the four spin rockets to provide the required 
impulse. In the ASLV-D3, only two of the four rockets could give 
the required impulse resulting in fewer revolutions per minute. 
The computers and software have been updated, and adequate 
safety margins provided to handle the shock imparted to the 
ongoing stage by the separated stage of the rocket. 
  The ASLV-D4 has five stages using solid fuel, including two 
strap-on motors that propel the 23.8 metre high rocket with a 
lift off weight of 41.7 tonnes. The SROSS-C2 [Stretched Rohini 
Satellite Series] satellite payload weighing 113 kg to be put in 
the 400 km elliptical orbit has two scientific experiments -- 
Gamma Ray Burst Detector and Retarding Potential Analyser. The 
satellite weighs about 7 kg more than the last one. 
  Briefing visiting presspersons at Sriharikota today, the 
Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Chairman, Dr. K. 
Kasturirangan, said the 47 hour countdown for the launch was 
progressing satisfactorily. 
  The scientific experiments were being repeated in the 
current 
satellite from the last time as the previous satellite had less 
than estimated life and did not provide the required quantum of 
data. 
  The previous flight -- ASLV-D3 -- as against the expected 
orbit of 400 km achieved only 264 km. The modifications in the 
vehicle this time have been brought in to overcome this. 
  Dr. Kasturirangan said the primary objective of the mission 
was to evaluate a number of technologies from the previous 
flights, including the strap-on motors, their separation 
dynamics, closed-loop guidance system, bulbous heat shield and 
flexible dynamics. 
  Mr. V. Manoharan, Project and Mission Director, ASLV, 
explained the modifications carried out in the latest 
developmental flight.

  [Text] Economic Service -- It is said that within the next 
10 to 15 years the nation's foreign exchange revenues from oil 
sales will be cut off. If is said that if agriculture is not the 
only hope, it is the nation's greatest hope for replacing oil. 
It said that the government is not giving the necessary 
attention to agriculture. It is said that with the measures that 
could be taken, the agriculture situation could be brought to a 
state that not only would we be self-sufficient with domestic 
consumption, but we could also break new ground in the area of 
exports. 
  The importance of agriculture and the proposed consolidation 
of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of the 
Construction Jihad have led us to seek interviews with the 
minister of agriculture, the minister of the construction jihad, 
the minister of heavy industries, and the minister of mines and 
metals. 
  Concerning the interview with Dr. 'Isa Kalantari, minister 
of 
agriculture through the efforts by Engineer Khamseh, general 
manager of publications for the Ministry of Agriculture, after 
three extensions of the time for the interview we were finally 
able last Thursday (a holiday) to have an interview with him for 
several hours. 
  Dr. 'Isa Kalantari is an expert on agriculture from several 
perspectives. He is an engineer in the field 
(agriculture/botanical engineering) from Urmia Agricultural 
University. He took his master's degree in the same field from 
America's University of Nebraska, and he finally graduated with 
an American Ph.D. in "agricultural physiology." 
  Dr. Kalantari's experience in science, research, and 
education includes teaching undergraduates as a doctoral 
student, research on issues pertaining to the physiology of 
agriculture with regard to corn and soy beans, research on the 
system of cultivation and the model for feeding the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, and teaching in various agricultural colleges. 
  What you will read below is the result of our relatively 
long 
interview with Dr. Kalantari. As always, in this interview he 
answered our questions using only his astonishing memory. 
  We hope in the near future to have ABRAR's interviews with 
the minister of the construction jihad, the minister of heavy 
industries, and the minister of mines and metals. 
  [ABRAR] Mr. Minister, it is being said that Iran's foreign 
exchange revenues will drop to zero in 10 to 15 years. 
  On the other hand, last year Iran imported about $1.5 
billion 
in foodstuffs, while our exports of agricultural crops, with all 
the commotion, did not even reach $1 billion. 
  In view of what has been said, many are worried that after 
its oil revenues end Iran will go hungry. Do you think this 
concern is appropriate, or groundless? 
  [Kalantari] Of course. Unfortunately, this is a reality. 
After 10 years, according to some people, after 15 years 
according to others, Iran's oil production will reach the point 
where it will only be enough for domestic consumption. Perhaps 
after 15 years we will have nothing to export without sharply 
reducting domestic consumption in order to have enough to export. 
  [ABRAR] How much domestic production [as published] is 
there, 
for us to "sharply reduce," as you say? 
  [Kalantari] Based on existing information, per-capita oil 
consumption in the world is declining sharply and continuously, 
while, to the contrary, in our country per-capita consumption is 
increasing. In this respect we are an exception in the world. 
  [ABRAR] Then you agree that in 15 years at most, we will 
have 
no more foreign exchange revenues from oil. In this case, what 
will happen? Will Iran go hungry or not? 
  [Kalantari] This depends on the Iranians themselves. We 
could 
go hungry or not go hungry. In my view, with appropriate 
investment and proper implementation, we could even make 
agricultural products a replacement for oil. 
  Everything depends on our own nation, it depends on our own 
planning and policy making. 
  [ABRAR] You referred to planning and the fact that the 
policymakers must make a decision. You are an agricultural 
policymaker. Our country has its resources. All the statistics 
and figures say we have everything. Why, in view of the vast 
variety of our climates, don't the policymakers, as you say, 
make decisions so that we will no longer import more food than 
we export? 
  [Kalantari] In general they wish to do this, but they have 
priorities. It is true that agriculture is currently an 
important priority, but 65 to 70 percent of the nation's foreign 
exchange revenues still comes from oil exports. We have had 
explosive population growth since the revolution. Along with 
that we have the problems and difficulties that were created for 
us by the imposed war. We have reconstruction before us. Well, 
when they took the priorities into account, clearly the bombed 
and destroyed refinery had priority. 
  [ABRAR] In your view was this setting of priorities correct? 
That is, did agriculture find its true position? 
  [Kalantari] I cannot express a definite opinion on this. The 
country was faced with a fuel shortage, and in any case its 
refinery had to be built. The power plants had to be rebuilt. 
Investment in building a dam to capture water had more priority 
than delivering water to a desert. 
  [ABRAR] You mentioned investment. What kind of attention was 
given to agriculture and investment in this sector after the 
revolution? 
  [Kalantari] Throughout the war we had no serious investment 
in the form of infrastructure investment in the agriculture 
sector. There was somewhat more attention after the war, but not 
to the point where we could do infrastructure work in order to 
be food exporters within five years. The priorities did not 
permit this. 
  [ABRAR] We were not even able to do anything to increase 
agricultural exports to the level of agricultural imports? 
  [Kalantari] If we judge fairly, we have had good progress in 
recent years. Four to five years ago we did not do what we could 
have done either with respect to production or development. We 
could have done more, invested more. We could have produced more. 
  [ABRAR] Why didn't you? 
  [Kalantari] Again this goes back to the level of resources. 
The financial resources did not exist. In infrastructure 
investment and foreign exchange, again the priorities went to 
other sectors. 
  [ABRAR] You said that after the war more attention was given 
to the agriculture sector. 
  [Kalantari] More attention was given, but not to the extent 
it should have been. 
  More investment was made, but perhaps it would have been 
appropriate if it had been several times that amount. You must 
realize that at that time we did not even have a consulting 
engineer in our organizations. Despite this, we came and created 
these shortages. The country has everything that is needed for a 
leap in production. 
  Some people did not believe in production. There were some 
who could not believe that it would be possible to produce. They 
say "agriculture does not have priority, agriculture does not 
have priority" so much that this has been transformed into a 
"belief." 
  [ABRAR] Has this belief now been discredited, or does it 
still exist? 
  [Kalantari] To some extent this belief has been discredited. 
Fortunately, those who hold this belief are now in the minority. 
  [ABRAR] Meaning there are not enough of them to be 
obstructive? 
  [Kalantari] Perhaps they can, but I do not think they can be 
successful. Nor do they any longer have the courage to do so. To 
some extent the performance under the Five-Year Plan and the 
clarification of issues and problems have disarmed them, unless 
they are people with little knowledge. Despite this, to the 
extent that we have gone from one atmosphere to another, 
standing in front of a tangible reality has made their task 
difficult. 
  [ABRAR] You have mentioned a jump in production. Can we hope 
for a jump in agricultural production in the near future? 
  [Kalantari] Of course we, meaning both the government and 
the 
Ministry of Agriculture, can make this jump. However we, meaning 
the government agriculture sector, have not always been the ones 
to decide. If the national will is at play, we certainly can do 
so. If there is no sabotage, we certainly can do so. 
  [ABRAR] If it is this way. If there is no sabotage. Who are 
these saboteurs, Mr. Minister? 
  [Kalantari] In any case, the overall decisionmaker is the 
government. 
  When the return on our irrigation is about 33 percent, when 
the nation's greatest agricultural problem, in terms of 
short-term production, is water, when with a small amount of 
investment this return could be increased to 50 percent, we have 
the resources. The engineering resources exist. The technical 
procedures exist. The industry exists. There is not even any 
foreign exchange needed in this sector. Our agriculture is 
suffering from the lack of water. 
  [ABRAR] As you put it, all the technical and executive 
resources exist. So where is the problem? Why don't you do this? 
  [Kalantari] The primary problem is financial. The government 
must give money, the government must invest. Supposing the 
government agrees to make 60 percent of the investment needed 
for agriculture, the people would pay the other 40 percent. 
  [ABRAR] How much is this 60 percent? 
  [Kalantari] A total of about 1,600 billion tumans. 
  [ABRAR] In view of the fact that this is a trivial amount in 
relation to this huge project, what kind of thinking, what 
group, invests billions of dollars in sectors that are not as 
necessary for the country as agriculture, while they are stingy 
in the agriculture sector? 
  [Kalantari] Well look, the one making the decision is the 
government, and ... 
  [ABRAR] You are a member of the Council of Ministers 
yourself, you have shared responsibility in the government... 
  [Kalantari] I have shared responsibility, agreed, but they 
say that 1,600 billion tumans does not exist. 
  [ABRAR] Where should the government's 60 percent share, 
which 
would be about 900 billion tumans, be spent? 
  [Kalantari] No, this must be procured over a six- or 
seven-year period. 
  [ABRAR] If this investment were made, what changes would be 
made in agriculture, other than raising the rate of return on 
water from 33 to 50 percent? 
  [Kalantari] Definitely and certainly, in the agriculture 
sector not only would we achieve self-sufficiency, but also our 
exports would increase dramatically? 
  [ABRAR] In my view, the implementation of such a beautiful 
and useful project would be supported by the Majles deputies, 
the media, and the officials. Who wants to put obstacles in your 
way? 
  [Kalantari] Well! They say: We have no money. Just last year 
about half the country was in a drought. We could have, 
fortunately, minimized the production deficiencies. 
  If we make the necessary investments, even if we do have a 
year or two of drought the damage will not be that great. 
  [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! You are being conservative to an 
extent. Half the farmers and experts believe that the attention 
that is being given to industries and services in the country is 
not being given to agriculture... 
  [Kalantari] Yes, in the First Five-Year Plan, we invested a 
great deal in industry. 
  [ABRAR] And your needs were not addressed? 
  [Kalantari] Our needs were addressed, but it got nowhere, 
other than the instance with water I mentioned. In the area of 
agricultural training, if we invested less than one-tenth of 
these costs in this area, there would be a striking increase in 
agricultural production. 
  [ABRAR] Look, Mr. Minister! All the experts, and by that I 
mean the experts with whom we are in contact, with whose 
theories we are familiar, or whose articles we read, believe 
that agriculture can get the country out of its one-product 
condition, that agriculture is the salvation of Iran's economy, 
and not industry. 
  [Kalantari] Agriculture and industries dependent on 
agriculture, modern and complete agriculture. Yes, in my view 
this comes before industry. 
  Our problem is the problem of the government's heavy 
expenses. The government has two million staff employees, and 
they all have wages. Taxes are not collected in sufficient 
amounts. 
  [ABRAR] These are not expenses, they cannot be contained. 
You 
do not mean that the wages of staff employees should be cut? 
  [Kalantari] No! We need more revolutionary action. As the 
president of the republic said at the last Friday prayer 
service, we must deal with these instances. 
  [ABRAR] What are these instances? 
  [Kalantari] The subsidies we pay to the energy sector are 
seven or eight times the amount the consumer spends. 
  The useless subsidy that is paid for gasoline is seven to 
eight times the entire budget for the nation's universities. 
  [ABRAR] Don't you think that if these subsidies were not 
paid, the main agencies in charge (the ministries of energy and 
petroleum) would use the extra revenues to develop their own 
work and not agriculture? 
  [Kalantari] A decision must be made. One must see. A 
solution 
must be found. A solution will be found.

  [Text] Economic Service. The consolidation of ministries, 
of which much is being said these days in agricultural circles, 
was one of the subjects we discussed in our interview with Dr. 
'Isa Kalantari, minister of agriculture. In this discussion many 
issues became clear to us, as economic writers. We did not know 
that one-third of the ministers in Vietnam's Government deal 
with agricultural issues. We did not know, for example, that New 
Zealand, whose agriculture and animal husbandry are famous, has 
done careful scientific planning to establish a separate 
ministry for each agricultural field, and after it achieves its 
goal they dissolve that ministry and then start anew in another 
field. 
  Fortunately, Dr. Kalantari knows no fatigue, and in speaking 
with him one can discuss every agricultural subject. Whenever 
the subject is progress and development, his face is cheerful, 
and whenever he feels that a danger threatens Iran's 
agriculture, sadness and sorrow are evident on his face. 
  In this interview we came to the conclusion that if any kind 
of change or consolidation were done without expert study and 
research in agriculture, which covers one-third of the nation's 
economy, it would be a national crime. Iran's farmers had four 
ministries at one time, at one time they had three, at one time 
they had two, and at one time they had one, and these baseless 
changes have transformed Iran from a food exporter to one of the 
region's main food importers. 
  Below you will read the second part of the interview with 
Dr. 
Kalantari. 
  [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! If you are willing, let us digress 
from 
the main subject and talk about the consolidation of ministries. 
As you know, the Majles has approved the consolidation of the 
Ministry of Industries, the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and 
the Ministry of Mines and Metals, and it is said that it is also 
studying consolidation of the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
Ministry of Construction Jihad. What is your view on this? 
  [Kalantari] Well, whatever is "the law" must be implemented. 
  [ABRAR] Yes. There is no doubt about this. However, we are 
asking you this question not as a minister of agriculture, but 
as Dr. 'Isa Kalantari, a real person, a man whose studies and 
executive occupations have had to do with the nation's 
agriculture for more than a decade. We are asking the Dr. 
Kalantari who has seen many of the nations that have 
agricultural industries, and who has close familiarity with the 
way they work. 
  [Kalantari] Well, we must ask what is the goal of doing 
this? 
If the goal is to have one organization responsible for the 
agricultural sector, we must sit and see what this will 
accomplish for our agriculture. I say this not as the minister 
of agriculture, but as someone who at least has the right to 
express an opinion on this matter, someone with 13 to 14 years 
experience in agricultural executive work and who has 
familiarity with the nation's problems, and who knows what our 
problems are in the agricultural sector. 
  [ABRAR] Yes, in view of the things you mentioned, we wanted 
to know, what views have you put forward in the meetings to make 
decisions on this important matter. 
  [Kalantari] Not in this matter, but even in the matter of 
food industries, which you mentioned previously, we are mostly 
observers. They do not even ask us in what part of the country a 
certain food industry should be located. 
  For example, it is possible that they will give an agreement 
in principle in a certain region to a food industry that is not 
a part of our system of cultivation at all. 
  [ABRAR] Do you mean that these kinds of decisions are made 
without even coordinating it with you? 
  [Kalantari] Yes, these decisions are made without 
coordination with us. 
  [ABRAR] In view of the close similarity of the work of the 
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Construction Jihad, 
in your view what organizations from your ministry should be 
attached to the Ministry of the Construction Jihad, and which 
ones from the Ministry of the Construction Jihad should be added 
to your ministry? 
  [Kalantari] I do not see many organizations that should be 
removed from these two ministries. The development of food 
industries should have a role in both of these ministries. 
  [ABRAR] Is the development of food industries now under the 
mantle of the Ministry of Industries? 
  [Kalantari] Yes. I am not saying that we should be in charge 
of the executive activity, but views must ultimately be given. 
Of course, in general the goals must be to improve the 
agricultural situation. This executive officer or that executive 
officer is not personally important to me. 
  [ABRAR] Is there no communication among the ministries? For 
example, in the production of agricultural machinery, aren't 
"needs" taken into account, with production done on the basis of 
needs? 
  [Kalantari] Sometimes needs are taken into account and 
sometimes they are not. 
  [ABRAR] Meaning that these communications are not maintained 
constantly between the ministries? 
  [Kalantari] These communications are very little. When they 
wish to do so, they establish them, when they do not wish to do 
so, they do not. 
  [ABRAR] How necessary are these communications? 
  [Kalantari] They are absolutely necessary! 
  [ABRAR] Is this discussed in the Council of Ministers as a 
problem? 
  [Kalantari] Of course, it has been discussed, and it was 
decided that a review would be done of the government 
organizations. 
  [ABRAR] What is your personal opinion about the 
consolidation 
of the two ministries? 
  [Kalantari] In my personal view, not only would this 
consolidation be of no benefit to the country, but as a solution 
to several small problems, it will create larger problems. In 
the area of production, we are now nearing the leaps we desire 
to make. We are preparing infrastructure. We will suddenly be 
faced with a huge expansion with which we will be absolutely 
unable to deal. I think that if one ministry comes into 
existence, the official in charge of it will not have the 
ability to think, nor will he have the ability to monitor the 
situation. This is a greater task than you think. 
  [ABRAR] Especially when in agricultural matters producers 
are 
absolutely affiliated with the government, they are absolutely 
supported by the government. 
  [Kalantari] This is really the main problem. If our 
agricultural producers were like the industrial producer where 
there is overall management, they would all be literate and 
their producing units would be big. In this case we would not 
have subsidies where the government would have to intervene. 
  [ABRAR] At a time when our country needs to do more to 
improve its agricultural lands, we hear officials saying that 
billions of tumans worth of the nation's pastures, soil and 
forests are on the verge of destruction. For example, they say 
that 64 percent of the nation's soil resources remain unused. 
What is the government doing? Why don't you do something? 
  [Kalantari] In view of the nature of our country, natural 
resources must be a separate matter. There should be a separate 
ministry for that. I believe that if we want to preserve our 
water and soil, for the next 30 to 40 years we must rebuild our 
natural resources in a mobilized and revolutionary way. 
  [ABRAR] By mobilized and revolutionary, do you mean outside 
administrative limits? 
  [Kalantari] Yes, outside the administrative bureaucracy. 
That 
is, all the nation's resources, when idle, should be mobilized 
to preserve natural resources. 
  I mean all forces, even military forces in peacetime. Even 
during summer vacations, students should be used for this 
national mobilization, which is very vital. 
  [ABRAR] Have you presented this idea anywhere? 
  [Kalantari] It has been presented again and again, but we 
have yet to reach a conclusion. What I am saying is that to 
improve the agricultural situation the two existing ministries 
are not enough. 
  [ABRAR] You are now emphasizing work on natural resources. 
Will a transfer of activity, such as transferring from the 
Ministry of the Construction Jihad to the Ministry of 
Agriculture, be useful for accomplishing this? 
  [Kalantari] Of course it depends on what decision is made. 
Transferring will not help at all. For example, it will make no 
difference to transfer activity from the Ministry of the 
Construction Jihad to the Ministry of Agriculture. The issue is 
that more attention should be given to natural resources. The 
ability to work must be increased. 
  [ABRAR] Other than natural resources, what other areas need 
more attention? 
  [Kalantari] The next problem is rural development. 
  [ABRAR] In view of these problems, in view of the fact that 
there are 60,000 rural areas in the country, don't you think 
that if the Ministry of the Construction Jihad were closer it 
would be more useful to the Ministry of Agriculture? 
  [Kalantari] No, this still needs work. Rural development 
must 
be done. 
  [ABRAR] Rural development is being done now. Is there mutual 
cooperation? 
  [Kalantari] Perhaps there is not a lot of need for 
cooperation. An executive officer can work on it, but there are 
few resources and little attention. More attention must be given 
to the nation's rural development, water and soil. This is a 
vast task. 
  I really don't know, in view of the vastness of the task, 
what those people who want to have one ministry in the 
agricultural sector are thinking about. 
  [ABRAR] I think this idea is in its early stages. It is 
still 
at the level of murmurs, talk, and study. 
  [Kalantari] No, a special commission has also been formed. 
However, this is a dangerous decision. It is a decision that 
will definitely bring our problems up to 100, yet the benefits 
probably won't even come to 10. 
  [ABRAR] Apparently they are considering manpower adjustment 
and reducing costs. They are thinking of reducing the number of 
buildings and other things... 
  [Kalantari] You have put your finger on an interesting 
point. 
Those who favor consolidation are thinking for example that if 
two ministries become one, there will be seven or eight fewer 
deputy ministers, 30 to 40 fewer general managers and five to 
six fewer consultants. 
  [ABRAR] Yes, it is just so. There will be reductions here. 
  [Kalantari] Yes, there might be a total of 200 fewer people. 
On the other hand, what would be lost? The respected Majles 
deputies and other officials who will be deciding must consider 
what return we will get for the country on an tuman we invest in 
these circumstances, and what will the return be under the new 
conditions? 
  We employ thousands of people in the agricultural sector. We 
must also meet our needs in the training, research, 
infrastructure, and other sectors. Definitely, if we want to 
have an active agricultural sector, we will not reduce manpower, 
we will increase it. These increases will take place in the 
specialist sectors, for our agriculture must necessarily move in 
that direction. Apart from that, if manpower is reduced by 200 
people, they will be employed elsewhere. 
  [ABRAR] What about the administrative buildings? Won't we 
save in this area? 
  [Kalantari] It is even possible that 10 to 15 buildings will 
be added, with a possible value of 2 billion or 10 billion 
tumans, but what will we be losing? The losses will be in the 
hundreds of billions of tumans. Economic, social, and scientific 
accounting, writing and adding and subtraction must be done, and 
then a decision must be made. 
  Of course, whatever decision the respected Majles makes will 
be implemented. However, I think that neither now nor in the 
next 10 to 20 years should we be thinking of reducing the size 
of the organizations in the agricultural sector. Ultimately, we 
will have to expand it. 
  Agriculture has a role in one-third of the nation's economy. 
  We must give more attention, much, much more attention to 
it. 
  [ABRAR] There have been many changes in the administration 
of 
the agricultural sector in our country. Sometimes these changes 
have been damaging. During one period the agricultural sector 
had four ministries (the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry 
of Agriculture and Consumer Materials, the Ministry of Natural 
Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); 
it had three during one period (the Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Ministry of Natural Resources, and the Ministry of Cooperatives 
and Rural Affairs); during one period it had two ministries (the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and the Ministry 
of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs); and during one period it had 
one ministry (the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development). 
  Several years after the revolution responsibilities were 
divided with the establishment of the Ministry of the 
Construction Jihad, and now that the responsibilities have been 
divided, and now that after several years these two ministries 
have become established, they are thinking of change again. 
  The question, though, is won't our agriculture be damaged by 
all this change? In your view, as a person who is educated and 
is a specialist in this field and who has worked in the 
agricultural sector for 12 to 13 years in various capacities, 
does our agricultural sector need several ministries? I have 
heard that in some some countries they have four or five active 
ministries in the agricultural sector. There is even a country 
like New Zealand, which creates a ministry in a specific field 
such as fisheries for 20 to 25 years, and then converts this 
ministry to function under another ministry (agriculture) after 
activating that field, and they establish another ministry in 
another field. 
  [Kalantari] I think our agriculture needs more than two 
ministries. I think there should now be one organization 
responsible for rural development, another responsible for the 
nation's natural resources, and another responsible for the 
nation's agriculture. This need will exist for our country for 
the next 20 to 30 years.

  [Text] Economic Service -- With all the efforts that were 
made to keep the interview with Dr. 'Isa Kalantari from going 
too long, in view of the importance of the issues discussed in 
this interview, we were reluctant to edit the article too much. 
  Despite the fact that many issues having to do with 
agriculture were discussed, it is necessary to explain that what 
you have read and will read today is excerpts from this 
relatively long interview. 
  Following the publication of the first and second 
installments of the interview, countless readers contacted the 
newspaper wanting to raise other issues with Dr. Kalantari. 
However, these readers must realize that it is practically 
impossible to discuss all the issues in one interview. 
  Even so, their questions were sent to the Public Relations 
Office of the Ministry of Agriculture, so we can print the 
answers after we receive them from the minister of agriculture. 
  It is worth mentioning that this interview will not be 
entirely conclusive unless we interview Engineer Gholam Reza 
Foruzesh, minister of construction jihad, and we hope to hold 
this interview as soon as possible. 
  Printed below in this issue you will find the final 
installment of the interview with Dr. Kalantari. 
  [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! With your permission, let us return to 
the first part of the interview. You have said repeatedly that 
the government has no money. On the one hand you have said that 
if the government would invest 900 million tumans over a 
seven-year period, many problems would be solved. This would be 
120-130 million tumans per year, and we hope that the Majles 
deputies, the media, the officials, and the government itself 
will give the necessary importance to this important matter. In 
this same regard you mentioned that energy subsidies are 
useless. Mr. Minister! The elimination of this subsidy for a 
people who are crushed beneath the weight of high prices cannot 
be a suitable solution. The people are also without money. How 
much is this energy subsidy? 
  [Kalantari] It is 2 trillion tumans per year! I am not 
saying 
this subsidy should be cut all at once. This should be done 
gradually, over a 10-year period. As far as I know, the 
government cannot make investments. This is an important point. 
With current revenues, with existing expenses, even if the 
government wishes to do so it cannot invest any more in 
agriculture. We need national investment. The people must be 
given a justification. The people must reduce their waste. The 
people must not be extravagant. 
  [ABRAR] The government has asked the people with you, and 
they have made reductions. In these 15 years the people have 
declared their willingness to make every kind of sacrifice. 
But...? 
  [Kalantari] We did not ask, but our religion has taught the 
people not to be extravagant for 1,400 years. 
  [ABRAR] The people are not extravagant. If what you mean by 
extravagance is waste, the people are not to blame. For example, 
with regard to wasted bread, it is the bad quality of the bread. 
Are you and the government to blame for this? 
  [Kalantari] This is one dimension of the problem. The 
government is also to blame. These very useless universal 
subsidies are one of the main factors in the waste. We must not 
give the public subsidies in the form of goods. We should pay 
money for the goods to the low-income classes. If someone buys 
bread at 35-40 tumans per kilogram and eats it, he does not 
throw it away, he does not waste it. A baker now makes 1 tuman 
profit for each kilogram of bread. Well, for this profit, we 
cannot expect him to sell good-quality bread. 
  [ABRAR] The president of the republic has also said this, 
but 
we heard that some people asked that we not get into this 
subject. Is that correct? 
  [Kalantari] Of course, those people want to take the easiest 
path, not the most proper path. They themselves do not want to 
deal with the problem. There are people who do not want to 
think. They do not want to put forth a new procedure. 
  [ABRAR] In what way can cash subsidies be paid to the needy 
and deprived, who are said to number about 40 million? 
  [Kalantari] About 40 percent of the nation's population is 
rural. We may not have anyone more deprived than them, but there 
is no bread subsidy for this great population (about 20 million 
people). They are buying bread at the true price. They are 
buying wheat at the same price it is sold to us and making it 
into flour and bread. There is no waste in their bread. There is 
also a solution for the others. 
  [ABRAR] Let us talk about agricultural exports. What are the 
difficulties now facing exports? 
  [Kalantari] Currently our food industries have two obstacles 
to exports, one is political, the other is hygiene. 
  [ABRAR] In the first case, I do not think that this is a 
serious obstacle, that is if we can export food at international 
standards. 
  [Kalantari] No, you are mistaken. If they are not buying our 
oil, does this mean they will buy our lemon juice and catsup? 
  [ABRAR] Meaning, from this perspective we have a problem 
with 
the European Common Market? 
  [Kalantari] Forget about the European Common Market. We have 
very little access to that. Consider our neighbor countries. 
With knowledge of the market price there, if we sold apples 
there at $.50 per kilogram, they would immediately bring the 
same apples of the same quality from that side of the world and 
sell them for $.20 per kilogram. 
  [ABRAR] Well, do they do this "dumping" everywhere? 
  [Kalantari] No! It is only for the products from our 
country. 
Just as soon as our agricultural products, and just ours, come 
in, this kind of competition, which is mostly political, takes 
place. Of course this is mostly done with goods that are subject 
to spoilage. 
  [ABRAR] Of the nation's some 51 million hectares [ha] of 
arable land, how much is actually being used? Statistics say 
that 64 percent of Iran's soil resources, 55 percent of its 
water resources, 63 percent of its forest and pasture resources, 
and 85 percent of its aquatic food sources are not being used. 
Are the statistics correct? 
  [Kalantari] The 51 million ha is correct, provided we have 
water. We now have 7.5 million ha of irrigated agriculture and 
about 11 million ha of dry-farmed agriculture. 
  [ABRAR] Meaning that the country's existing water is not 
sufficient for these 51 million ha? 
  [Kalantari] It is not adequate for 51 million ha. However, 
if 
we want, we can easily increase irrigated farm land from 7.5 
million to 20 million ha, as I said before, if there is 
investment, if the government wishes to do so, if the Majles 
insists. 
  [ABRAR] ...and 63 percent of the forest and pasture 
resources? 
  [Kalantari] You should ask the minister of construction 
jihad 
about that, but I do not think this figure is correct. 
  [ABRAR] ...and 85 percent of the aquatic food resources? 
  [Kalantari] I think you should ask the executive director of 
fisheries about that. 
  [ABRAR] We would like to know your view of the claim that if 
proper use were made of aquatic resources our country would be 
freed of the need to import hundreds of millions of dollars of 
food each year. 
  [Kalantari] I think that we use more than 15 percent of the 
sea resources. It is difficult for me to believe this. 
  [ABRAR] You asked us to ask the minister of the construction 
jihad about forests and pastures. What is your view? 
  [Kalantari] The greatest damage to the nation's agriculture 
is the destruction of water and soil. In the future, this will 
not only be a cultivation problem, it will also be a major 
problem for the nation's industries as well. They are destroying 
the country, they are destroying life. Every year 4 billion 
square meters, or 400,000 ha, or 4,000 square km, of our 
nation's soil is destroyed and... 
  [ABRAR] And this is negligence by you and the government! 
  [Kalantari] All of us! It makes no difference if it is the 
people, the government, they all go together. 
  [ABRAR] What did the people do wrong? How can they prevent 
the destruction of water and soil? 
  [Kalantari] It makes not difference. All of us! We do not 
notice that our country's soil is being destroyed. 
  [ABRAR] Well, now we ask you. What should be done to prevent 
the destruction of water and soil? 
  [Kalantari] I say that we valued our country's water and 
soil 
when we were faced with a foreign enemy and our youth sacrificed 
themselves for every inch of our homeland's water and soil. Then 
we have thousands of kilometers of our soil being destroyed and 
we are silent. Yet it is necessary for us to give this same 
importance to our water and soil in the struggle against natural 
problems, and not just in the battle with the foreign enemy. 
This task does not cost a lot. Its importance has not yet become 
evident to the country. The people and the officials are not yet 
aware of the importance of this problem culturally and 
economically. 
  [ABRAR] Now that we have become aware of the importance of 
the problem, what should we do to prevent heavy losses to our 
nation's soil? 
  [Kalantari] We must determine what are the agents of the 
destruction. 
  [ABRAR] Who should determine that? 
  [Kalantari] We must determine it. 
  [ABRAR] You are determining it. Are you studying in order to 
prevent this destruction? 
  [Kalantari] As I said to you before, this task is not one of 
the responsibilities of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is the 
responsibility of the Ministry of the Construction Jihad. 
  [ABRAR] Mr. Minister! Thank you for the time you have given 
us for this relatively long interview. We hope we have not tired 
you. 
  [Kalantari] I thank you also.

<F P=106> [Article by Dr. Nuri Zadeh: "The Coca Cola, Pepsi Cola, and </F>
Hamburger War in the Republic of the Ayatollahs"] 
  [Text] About three months ago, the manager of the 
Pavilion-M [Ravaq-M] Restaurant, in the northern part of the 
Iranian capital, invited a crowd of journalists and cultural 
figures to attend the grand opening ceremony of this luxury 
restaurant, the construction of which cost more than 800 million 
Iranian rials [R]. It was expected that the Pavilion-M 
Restaurant would serve fast food (hamburgers and sandwiches like 
at McDonald's). When those invited went to the restaurant on the 
appointed day, they were surprised to encounter hundreds of 
members of the [Revolution] Guard, young revolutionaries, and 
some clergymen encircling the restaurant after it had been 
destroyed, hoisting signs with the slogan "Death to America, 
death to McDonald's, down with hamburgers, we will not allow the 
squandering of the blood of the martyrs by having McDonald's 
come into Tehran." 
  Two days later it turned out that the reason for the anger 
of 
Hizbollah, which had attacked the restaurant, was the letter "M" 
that the owner of the restaurant had drawn on the windows of the 
restaurant and the fact that it looked like the "M" used by the 
McDonald's Corporation. 
  In an interview with the press, the restaurant owner said 
that he was managing a large restaurant corporation in Spain 
when some of Rafsanjani's men contacted him, inviting him to set 
up similar restaurants in Iran, under the protection of the 
government. He revealed the fact that he had paid large amounts 
of money to the municipality and to the advertising company 
subordinate to the municipality for the preparation of a special 
logo for the restaurant. He assured the press that the letter 
"M" referred to the name of his company and not to McDonald's. 
  The incident involving the destruction of the Pavilion-M 
Restaurant unleashed a war of words between the supporters of 
the president of the Republic and the representatives of the 
radical movement in the Majles and in the press. The government 
was subjected to fierce attacks in the Majles and Friday prayers 
because it had given permission to the U.S. company, Coca Cola, 
to set up plants in Khorasan and Tehran in order to produce the 
Iranian people's favorite drink. One should bear in mind that 
the revolution had confiscated the property of the Coca Cola, 
Pepsi Cola, and 7-Up companies in 1979. Pepsi Cola, however, 
returned to Iran, but with a new taste, which after a while was 
not accepted by the Iranian people. But those who still wanted 
Coca Cola had to buy their favorite drink on the black market, 
where a can of Coca Cola produced in Pakistan, Turkey, or the 
Gulf states cost 80 tomans. Since the Coca Cola plants began 
production in Iran on the basis of an agreement between the U.S. 
company and the Iranian Coca Company, most of whose shares are 
owned by businessmen who have close ties to the government, the 
other beverages such as Pepsi Cola, Canada [Dry], and Kawthar 
Cola have not been able to compete with it. The result is that 
bankruptcy is the possible fate of the firms that produce all 
these drinks--all of which are owned by the Foundation for the 
Oppressed. 
  In spite of the hostile campaigns, the Coca Cola Company 
continues to operate, and its plant in Tehran is expected to 
begin production, after it has been shown that the plant in 
Mashhad is unable to keep up with the market demand which 
consumes 2 billion containers of non-alcoholic beverages per 
year. This surge in business happened because of protection 
granted by President Rafsanjani and his assistant for economic 
affairs, Dr. Mohsen Nurbakhsh, to the Coca Cola Company and all 
the companies which benefited from the easy terms provided at 
the beginning of Rafsanjani's administration and proceeded to 
set up joint companies and plants with foreign establishments. 
  Although the radicals succeeded in destroying the Pavilion-M 
Restaurant and preventing what they described as McDonald's 
entering the land of the revolution, Coca Cola still remains the 
symbol of change in this country where the U.S. dollar has 
become the semi-official currency. 
  As long as Coca Cola bottles fill refrigerators, according 
to 
Qazvin's representative in the Majles, the men of the revolution 
will consider Iran to be in danger, and will be forgetting what 
the real danger is. 
<H5>  The Real Danger </H5>
  "This son and his father turned Iran into a big graveyard." 
This is the famous utterance spoken by Ayatollah Khomeyni, on 
the day of his return to Iran in January of 1979, at the Zahra' 
Garden Cemetery when he was describing the Shah and his father 
Reza Shah, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty. By now this 
utterance has become part of a joke told by people in Iran, and 
which goes as follows: "The Shah turned Iran into a humble 
cemetery, but there is no greater cemetery in the world than the 
Cemetery of the Imam [Khomeyni]." 
  A total of 15 years has passed by since Khomeyni made this 
utterance, and during that time the Iranian people have gone 
through hardships that ordinary people would not be able to 
bear. The word "oppressed," which was used a lot by Khomeyni and 
his associates at the beginning of the revolution to describe 
the poor among these people, now has come to be used when 
referring to the majority of the people. 
  During the Naw-Ruz (Iran's national new year holiday) 
celebrations after the revolution in March of 1979, Ayatollah 
Khomeyni said that there was no reason to have the holiday that 
year since the families of the martyrs and the oppressed were 
not able to celebrate it, and that first of all it was necessary 
for them to secure their basic necessities. At the time, these 
statements aroused a tremendous protest on the part of Engineer 
Bazargan, the prime minister, and Hasan Nazih, head of the 
National [Iranian] Petroleum Company and head of the Attorneys' 
Union. Bazargan put on an elegant suit and addressed the people 
in a large stadium, saying: "Let's celebrate the holiday this 
year even more than last year." And Hasan Nazih said: "A nation 
in which the average individual income is $4,000 and which has 
billions of dollars of hard currency reserves is not an 
oppressed nation." There is no doubt that Nazih did not foresee 
that the Iranian people would be transformed into a nation of 
oppressed people within the space of just a few years, while 
hundreds of the mullahs and their sons, plus the merchants 
having ties to those in the centers of power, would join the 
ranks of the rich. 
<H5>  The Oil Share </H5>
  During the revolution, the clergymen with ties to Ayatollah 
Khomeyni who occupied the high-ranking positions in the Islamic 
Republic, were promising the people that the revolution would 
bring them electricity, gas, and gasoline free of charge, and 
that basic goods would not be taxed. They also said that what 
they then called the "oil share," that is, each person's share 
earned from the oil revenues, would be distributed among the 
people every month. The striking thing about the matter is that 
Dr. Mohammad Mofatteh, one of the clergymen with close ties to 
the leader of the revolution, who was assassinated after the 
revolution, said, during one of his speeches in Tehran's Quba 
Mosque, two days after Khomeyni's return: "After the revolution, 
every Iranian will have the right to demand $270 a month, which 
will be his share of the oil revenues." Dr. Mofatteh 
disappeared, and those who believed him and joined the bandwagon 
of the revolution on their way to prosperity and economic and 
social justice did not receive anything from the oil revenues. 
  In spite of the intensified censorship of the press, some 
publications such as newspapers SALAM and HAMSHAHRI, and the 
satirical newspaper GOL AQA, occasionally publish stories 
dealing with the tragedy of the nation that has depended on the 
promises of the clergymen and sent them to positions of power, 
only to then pray that God bring back the days of the Shah. Or, 
as GOL AQA said, in one of its issues, on the basis of a line 
from popular poetry: "We didn't appreciate the gold, so they 
were generous with us and gave us copper." 
  We have chosen excerpts from the column "Telephone of the 
Readers," in the newspaper SALAM, letters from the readers in 
the newspapers JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI and the satirical newspaper GOL 
AQA, as well as excerpts from a report published by HAMSHAHRI, 
concerning the widespread poverty in Iran, in order to show the 
reality of how the Iranian people live after 15 years of their 
"revolutionary" regime. 
  The following was printed in the radical newspaper SALAM, 
published by Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad Musavi-Kho'iniha, the 
former public prosecutor and leader of the Line of the Imam 
students, in Issue No. 802 of 20 February 1994: "I ask those in 
power, why are the oppressed ones, who have to buy a kilogram of 
chicken for R2,700 , at fault? Did the price of the dollar rise 
because of the month of Ramadan or the Naw-Ruz holiday?" 
  In the same issue of SALAM we read: "I am the father of a 
student at the Free University in Tehran, which is owned by 
Rafsanjani, Khamene'i, and a number of other persons in high 
positions in the regime. For my son's tuition, I paid R331,000 
for the first semester and 345,000 for the second semester. And 
now the people in charge of the university are demanding that I 
pay them an additional R263,000 for last year. Is the Free 
University free to raise its tuition whenever it wants and as 
much as it wants?" 
  Another quote from the same issue of SALAM was: "I am a 
retired employee. I swear by God that I still do not own my 
house. Thirty years ago I bought a small plot of land in a 
railroad town. However, the municipality refuses to issue me a 
building permit." 
  In Issue No. 806 of SALAM, dated 26 February, we read: "The 
removal of the slogan `Death to Saddam' from the walls of Tehran 
on the occasion of the arrival of an Iraqi delegation to Tehran, 
has caused a lot of anguish to the families of the martyrs. 
Being a member of an Iranian family that has given up a few 
martyrs in the fight against Saddam, I strongly protest this." 
  In Issue No. 805 of the same newspaper, we see the 
following: 
"Whenever I hear the word `subsidy,' referring to the government 
support for the prices of foodstuffs, I am very surprised. 
Officials are talking about government price supports as if they 
are paying for them from their own pockets or from the wealth of 
their families. Were the allocations for government subsidies 
for some of the foodstuffs not provided from the treasury and 
the revenues earned from oil, gas, and copper, which are the 
property of the people? And are we still providing Syria with 
oil free of charge?" 
  In the same issue we read: "The president of the Republic 
indicated that prices in Iran are very low. Does he know 
anything about the salary levels of employees?" 
  From Another Newspaper: 
  In the newspaper HAMSHAHRI, which is put out by the 
municipality of Tehran on colored pages costing the municipality 
R250 per copy (whereas the paper is sold at a price of R50 per 
copy), a report dealing with widespread poverty was published in 
Issue No. 356, dated 9 March 1994. 
  One of the things mentioned in the introduction to the 
report, which was written by the newspaper's editor for social 
affairs, was the following: "Have I suffered hunger? I don't 
mean for an hour, a day, or three days, but rather for a whole 
month, a whole year, or a number of years. 
  "Do you know what it means to be an orphan? Or what it means 
not to be waiting for someone? Believe me, there are many 
children in Iran who are dreaming about having a hand of 
compassion. Do you know what it means to have to wait a whole 
month just to eat a bowl of rice? Do you know how long it takes 
for a poor child to forget what a banana looks like? 
  "Can you put yourself in the place of Maryam, the young girl 
who came to school at the end of spring with her winter coat on 
and who, in spite of the sarcastic remarks of her schoolmates, 
was unable to take it off because she wanted to hide her shabby 
clothes? 
  "Have you ever been in the position of the father who, a few 
days ago, pretended to his children that he was going to buy 
clothes for them for the holidays? Could you, like his children, 
pretend that you don't need any new clothes and that what you 
have is beautiful and up-to-date? Can you put yourself in the 
place of the eldest son of an Iranian family who, when he sees 
that the dinner table does not have enough food for his little 
brothers and sisters, pretends that he has already eaten outside 
home and that his stomach is full?" 
  Then the report from HAMSHAHRI talks about some families who 
were visited by the writer of the report. They include the 
family of "Khadijeh," a 40-year-old woman. Khadijeh says that 
her husband committed suicide four years ago because of poverty 
and how hard life was for him. 
  Khadijeh is a mother of four, and she has to take care of 
her 
family with 4,000 tomans per month (bearing in mind that the 
cost of a kilogram of meat in government stores is more than 576 
tomans). In other words, Khadijeh, with her monthly salary, is 
not even able to buy seven kilograms of meat. 
  In the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, the newspaper's 
editor-in-chief called upon the "rich to help the oppressed ones 
during the feast." But the nouveaux riches are not concerned, 
they live in luxury homes in northern Tehran, which they 
occupied under the protection of the Revolution Guard, they ride 
around in bullet-proof Mercedes cars, and they send their 
children to the land of the Great Satan (America) for them to go 
to school there and to enjoy themselves. 
<H5>  Dr. Sa'id Has Barely Enough to Live On, and Hamid Reza, the </H5>
Fruit Peddler, Now Owns Half of Tehran 
  Dr. Sa'id studied English at the Pahlavi University in 
Shiraz, and received a Ph.D. in English Literature, with a 
rating of "very good," from the University of Tehran two years 
before the revolution took place. He is married and has three 
children, the eldest of which is Hamid, who is studying physics 
in his first year at the University of Tehran. His wife, Mina, 
works as a teacher in the Girls' Institute. He works as an 
instructor at the University of Tehran, he also teaches six 
hours a week at the Institute of International Political and 
Economic Studies in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and he also 
puts in 10 hours at the Free University. On weekends he makes 
corrections in academic books that have been translated for the 
Tehran University Publishing Company. He was one of those who 
was enthusiastic about the revolution, and he was one of the 
founders of the Association of Revolutionary Professors who led 
the university sit-in in Iran. As a member of the revolutionary 
professors' delegation, he met Khomeyni on the day of his return 
to Iran. 
  The earnings of Dr. Sa'id and his wife, in addition to the 
amounts of money they get from various sources and from 
additional teaching and translation, amount to 67,000 tomans a 
month. This total equals 10 times the average salary of a 
low-ranking government employee. But in spite of this, for about 
a year Dr. Sa'id has been forced to work at night, using his 
Paykan automobile to transport passengers back and forth between 
Tehran and Karaj. 
  Every time Dr. Sa'id takes five passengers from Tehran to 
nearby Karaj, he receives R5,000 from them. This has helped a 
great deal to make his life easier. 
  In an interview with the newspaper ETTELA'AT, Dr. Sa'id 
pointed out that the rent gobbles up half of his earnings, and 
that he lives in a two-bedroom apartment in downtown Tehran. 
  Dr. Sa'id's only hope is that he will be able to send his 
son 
Hamid abroad to continue his studies before he is drafted into 
the military. 
  Dr. Sa'id's cultured wife Mina is not even 45 years old, but 
her appearance suggests that she is in her late forties. She is 
apprehensive about the future of her two daughters. She says: 
"Women have no value in Iran. The mentality of the men has 
changed during recent years. They [now] look at women as if they 
are furniture for the kitchen and bedroom." 
<H5>  The Story of Mohammad 'Ali </H5>
  Mohammad 'Ali is a man in his forties who lives in the city 
of Esfahan. His eldest son Reza was killed in the war between 
Iran and Iraq, and his second son Mahmud lost an arm on the 
front. 
  He works in the iron and steel plants in Esfahan, and his 
monthly salary amounts to 12,000 tomans. He also receives 3,000 
tomans from the Martyr Organization for his handicapped son 
Mahmud. 
  Mohammad 'Ali lives with his wife and five children in a 
humble house he inherited from his father before the revolution. 
He was one of the revolutionary workers, and after the 
revolution took place, he worked in the city of Esfahan's 
Central Revolutionary Committee for a year. At the same time, 
his eldest son Reza was one of the first to volunteer when the 
Iran-Iraq war broke out. 
  In a letter to the newspaper SALAM, Mohammad 'Ali explained 
his tragedy, saying that his salary was not enough to feed even 
dry bread or rice to his children. He wondered: "Did the 
revolution not promise us a happy, decent life?" 
  Mohammad 'Ali begins his day at 0600. After he prays, he 
rides to the plant on his bicycle and works there from 0800 to 
1700. Then he goes to the factory of Hajj Kazem, one of his 
relatives, and works there as a mechanic from 1800 until 2200. 
When he arrives back home, the hands of the clock show 2230. 
<H5>  Dr. Homa Darabi </H5>
  Dr. Homa Darabi graduated from the College of Medicine at 
the 
University of Tehran, and specialized in psychiatry at a 
well-known American university. She married a colleague of hers, 
a well-known psychiatrist. Homa joined the Iranian National 
Front, which was in opposition to the Shah, when she was a 
university student, and was an active member of the Front. She 
went to jail because of her political activity and because of 
her admiration for the late national Iranian leader Dr. Mohammad 
Mosadeq after the revolution. When Daryush Foruhar, the leader 
of the National Front, became minister of labor, he suggested 
that Dr. Darabi be chosen as his assistant. But Homa refused to 
accept official positions, and she continued her work as a 
doctor and university professor. Homa Darabi's tragedy began 
when Ayatollah Khomeyni decided to get rid of the nationalists 
and exercise power as a dictator. In spite of this, she resisted 
all of the pressures and continued to teach and receive patients 
at her private clinic. But one day in 1992 she received an 
official letter from the rector of the University of Tehran, 
informing her that she was discharged from the university 
because of her views, which were hostile to the government. For 
two years Homa Darabi fought the university administration and 
the government in order that the unjust ruling issued against 
her be reconsidered. However, she admitted defeat when the 
Administrative Court gave its support to the ruling made by the 
rector of the University of Tehran. On a cold day last February, 
Homa got up early, took one last look at her sleeping husband 
and one of her daughters, and left the house, carrying a big 
container full of gasoline. She drove her car toward the Tehran 
suburb of Shemiran, chose a spot that was full of people passing 
by, and then got out of her car. As she was throwing the 
contents of the container all over her body, she began shouting 
slogans against the regime and ignited herself. As the fire was 
burning her body, some of the passers-by hurried to save her, 
but the revolutionary lady did not allow anyone to come near her 
and she continued to scream until she fell down to the ground. A 
few hours later Homa Darabi fell silent, while she was still 
dreaming of freedom. 
<H5>  The Story of Hamid Reza </H5>
  Hamid Reza is forty years old, was not able to finish 
elementary school because his family was too poor, and had to 
work in the fruit-sellers' square in the city of Tehran for 
several hours as a porter. After working there for a while, he 
met Mr. Mohsen 'Ali, whose brother owned a big store in the 
fruit-sellers' square, and Mohsen 'Ali helped him to get a job 
with his brother, Hajj Javad, the store owner. Hajj Javad was 
one of Ayatollah Khomeyni's supporters and participated in 
demonstrations in support of him against land reform and 
granting women the right to vote in 1963. During Khomeyni's 
exile in Turkey and Iraq, Hajj Javad used to send amounts of 
money to him from time to time. This earned Hajj Javad a special 
place in the heart of Ayatollah Khomeyni. During the revolution, 
Hajj Javad became responsible for Khomeyni's reception 
committee, while his brother Mohsen was made responsible for 
driving Khomeyni's car, on the day of his return, from the 
airport to the 'Alavi School. And Mohsen, who in all of his 
activities had not forgotten his friend Hamid Reza, chose him to 
be one of Khomeyni's bodyguards and bought him a pistol from a 
former member of the armed forces. 
  Hamid Reza thus became one of the Imam's bodyguards. When 
the 
Revolution Guard was established and Mohsen got one of the 
leading positions, he appointed Hamid Reza as an assistant to 
the commander of the Revolution Guard in the Tehran area. As 
Mohsen's position rose in importance, Hamid Reza's position also 
rose with him until he became head of the Intelligence Division 
of the Revolution Guard in 1984 and he kept this position until 
his friend Mohsen was transferred to the Foundation for the 
Oppressed. At that point, Hamid Reza decided to try his luck in 
commercial business, during the beginning phase of the 
commercial open-door policy. Of course, Hamid Reza kept, and 
still keeps, his influence with the Revolution Guard and its 
intelligence division. He is also considered to be one of the 
most powerful men of the regime in Iran, in spite of the fact 
that, to all outward appearances, he works in the field of 
business. Hamid Reza's wealth, after he took possession of the 
Kater Company, is estimated at about 1.7 billion tomans. He owns 
a palace in Tehran, as well as a villa overlooking the Caspian 
Sea, a large park in Karaj, a 148-apartment housing complex at 
Vanak Square, in North Tehran, and he supervises 40 industrial 
units. He also owns 30 percent of the business shops in the 
Safavi Market in North Tehran. 
  Hamid Reza begins his day at 0900, he sits in the back seat 
of his bullet-proof Mercedes, and orders his driver to take him 
to the Kater Company on Shari'ati Street. After his inspection 
tour at the company, he goes to one of the secret headquarters 
of the Intelligence Division of the Revolution Guard where he 
reads a few letters and files and then issues some orders. At 
about noon he goes to the "Rest House," which is a building 
surrounded with trees in North Tehran, where he spends hours 
with his buddies sitting around an opium table. In the evening, 
he makes inspection rounds at his companies and establishments, 
visits some officials, and then he goes to his white villa where 
he spends the remaining hours of the evening with his family and 
children, watching the latest videos from America and Europe and 
satellite channel programs which the people of Iran are 
forbidden to watch.

  The average rise in prices of ready-made clothing was 130 
percent. Men's suits which sold for R500 before the revolution 
now sell for R65,000. The percentage of the increase in prices 
for domestically produced cars (Paykan, Renault, Peugeot, 
Nissan) rose tremendously. 
  The price of the Paykan car rose from R500,000 in 1979 to 
R18 
million in 1994. The price of a 1979 Chevrolet car, produced in 
Iran (the production of which stopped after the revolution), now 
is R11.5 million, whereas the price of this car, when purchased 
in 1979, was R1.1 million. 
  Whoever is able to purchase an imported Mercedes automobile 
(the favorite car of the clergymen and those in positions of 
power) will have to pay R16 billion, that is, 16 million tomans, 
in order to get one.

<F P=106> [Article by Ja'far Ra'id: "Challenges Facing President </F>
Rafsanjani"] 
  [Text] The majority of members of the Majles belong to a 
bloc strongly linked to the bazaar--the big traditional 
merchants--in the Iranian homeland generally and in the capital, 
Tehran, particularly. This bloc has become known as the Resalat 
group, in reference to a daily morning newspaper RESALAT 
(Message) that speaks for them. 
  The Resalat bloc does not rally under the banner of a party 
organization or the like. The group is united only by ties of 
mutual acquaintance and cooperation based on common principles 
and economic interests. 
  Terms used in the media, such as rightist, leftist, 
fundamentalist, and other similar terms do not apply to the 
Iranian Resalat group. Basically, we can say that it is 
religiously and culturally conservative, but believes in 
allowing free scope to the private sector, supporting the 
national economy, and resisting foreign hegemony. The group 
maintains very strong links to circles of the ulama and their 
entourage of religious students, especially in Qom at present 
and in Mashhad. 
  It is certain that the streets of the Iranian bazaar, in 
agreement with the halls of Shiite religious schools, were what 
initially undertook to spread the seeds of the Iranian 
revolution, sustaining it physically and morally until it took 
root, grew, flourished, and bore fruit. 
  In the summer of 1963, the bazaar led a violent uprising in 
Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad, which the shah's government suppressed 
without mercy, slaying or wounding many victims. In the wake of 
the uprising, Imam Khomeyni, the mastermind of the bloody 
uprising, was banished from the country. He remained with his 
family in his place of exile in Turkey for a year and a few 
months, then went to Iraq and settled in al-Najaf. He worked 
openly and secretly to overthrow the imperial system in Iran. He 
succeeded in realizing his goal in February 1979, after about 16 
years. The bazaar had been the firm base of the revolution since 
it began fermenting in the forties. Leftist and extremist 
organizations joined the revolutionary mass shortly before the 
outbreak of the revolution. That was the unruly sea that 
overthrew a venerable regime whose roots went back 3,000 years 
into history and brought an entirely new regime, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. 
  Using methods at which only they excel, the extremist 
organizations succeeded in riding the wave of the Iranian 
revolution during its prime and infiltrating strategic centers 
in it. During the first days, they publicly or secretly 
eliminated most of those they considered their enemies. So 
influential did they become in sensitive areas that they 
eliminated the chosen elite of revolutionary leaders that had 
sprung from that conservative traditional milieu, such as 
Ayatollah Beheshti and Ayatollah Motahhari. Some of them they 
assassinated individually; in the case of over 70 of them they 
blew up the hall in which they had gathered. With the speed of 
an irresistible whirlwind, these extremist groups nationalized 
companies and institutions and seized homes and real estate on 
various pretexts. However, the revolution's top leadership was 
gradually able to free itself from these extremist groups, one 
of which was the Tudeh party, the largest Moscow-oriented 
communist party in the Middle East. Some of the party's leaders 
are still in prison. Death on the gallows awaited some of its 
military leaders. 
  Days upon days pass. Domestic events react with 
international 
and regional developments. Circumstances help the traditional 
bazaar group regroup and rebuild their ranks. They seize the 
opportunity to banish extremist ulama such as Mohtashami and 
Khoi'niha from the parliamentary arena. The group slips quietly 
without noise into the Majles. It chooses one of its supporters, 
Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, as speaker of the Majles. 
The group practically holds the reins of the Iranian Majles. It 
emerges into view as able to exert more influence on President 
'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani than the hard-liners who had 
ridden roughshod throughout the third session of the Majles, 
which preceded the present session. 
  For the first time since the revolution, observers can 
witness in Iran the formation of a class or quasi-class on the 
way to gaining power in the country and adopting a policy with 
more or less clear features on the domestic and foreign level. 
It then will be feasible for the major forces that control the 
courses of international policies to enter into fruitful 
dialogue with the bodies representing that class or quasi-class 
for the benefit of Iran, the region, and the entire human 
community. This class or quasi-class, starting from its 
interests, its historical roots and social position, and its 
relations with other sectors of the Iranian people, is trying to 
play an active role in the following four directions: 
  1. Not to turn its back on the revolution that has taken 
place in the country, but to make a strenuous effort to 
safeguard its accomplishments and gains and strive to preserve 
its Islamic Shiite character. 
  2. Not to neglect Iran's national interests, however strong 
the external pressures, and to strive continually to protect 
those interests, making sacrifices if necessary to defend them. 
  3. To maintain the existing broad relations between it, 
religious scholarly circles, and the traditional religious 
seminaries. 
  4. Defend stubbornly and without yielding the interests of 
this class and its traditional allies among learned religious 
bodies; this by maintaining the strength of the private sector, 
encouraging its role through the market economy, and 
facilitating government support to it. 
  There is evidence that this development that has emerged 
from 
events in Iran has not escaped the notice of some major 
countries. These countries now are busily seeking ways to help 
them approach the centers that represent the Resalat group and 
enter into dialogue with them. 
  The beginning of the story of this group coincides with the 
revolution and a religious scholar named Ayatollah Azari-Qomi, 
the second greatest judge of the Iranian revolution after its 
victory. Arrested and imprisoned during the time of the shah, he 
is said to have memorized the Koran during his stay in prison. 
Appointed the revolution's public prosecutor, he followed a 
moderate path, helping many of those arrested to leave prison 
and saving them from death. He became known for gentleness and 
tolerance. 
  On account of this, stubborn hard-liners opposed him and 
forced him to resign. He traveled to Iraq to make contact with 
the ulama of al-Najaf. (It was before the outbreak of war 
between the two countries.) When he returned to Iran, he taught 
religious courses at the seminary in Qom. He established a bond 
of cooperation with the Association of Revolutionary Teachers 
supported by Imam Khomeyni--it is now sponsored by Ayatollah 
Sayyid 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the revolution. Azari-Qomi was 
elected to membership in the second session of the Majles as 
representative of the city of Qom. The session began in 1984 and 
ended in 1988, a period of four years, as the Iranian 
constitution specifies. During the session he was elected to 
membership on the parliamentary committee on economic and 
financial affairs. 
  Ayatollah Azari-Qomi is considered a superior jurist. 
Responsible parties in the Islamic Republic of Iran refer to him 
for his opinion on various matters of Islamic law. Imam Khomeyni 
and the regime assigned him major tasks, including serving as 
the revolution's public prosecutor and representing Imam 
Khomeyni in the Majles to review the constitution of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran. Azari-Qomi was one of Imam Khomeyni's 
outstanding students. 
  Azari-Qomi became famous for his independent positions and 
his opposition to the governments that successively assumed 
responsibility for administering the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  One of the most important things to be mentioned in this 
regard is his opposition to the policy of the former prime 
minister, Engineer Mir Hoseyn Musavi Khamene'i, who followed a 
line very close to socialism when it came to safeguarding 
private property and big corporations. Azari-Qomi was the 
regime's religious scholar who presented the greatest challenge 
to Musavi, whom Imam Khomeyni had no other choice than to 
support strongly as prime minister during the Iraq-Iran war. 
Azari-Qomi strongly attacked the government's economic policy 
and received threats from some enthusiastic supporters of that 
policy. 
  In 1985, Azari-Qomi and his group of supporters began 
publishing a daily newspaper entitled RESALAT as a free pulpit 
to spread their ideas and explain their political ethic. It was 
said at the time that there might be a degree of understanding 
and mutual rapprochement between Ayatollah Azari-Qomi and the 
then deputy speaker of the Majles, Ayatollah Shaykh Mohammad 
Yazdi. Shaykh Mohammad Yazdi is currently head of the judiciary. 
The newspaper was known from the beginning for following a 
moderate line calling for establishing balanced international 
relations and a market economy. 
  Observers in Iran believe that Azari-Qomi speaks for the 
bazaar people (the big merchants in the Iranian market). He has 
been and remains an indefatigable critic of state interference 
with the private sector. He supports the private sector's 
administering most economic affairs, including civil services, 
communications, and such development projects as dams and the 
like. This attitude has encouraged the major bazaar merchants to 
support the newspaper RESALAT and its owner. 
  It should be mentioned that this group's support of the 
country's top policy achieved an overwhelming victory for the 
government wing. This group took the lion's share in the results 
of elections for the fourth and current session of the Majles. 
The Resalat bloc has the most powerful influence in the Majles. 
Its legislative weight gives it the power to make any bill in 
the Majles succeed or fail. 
  The full name of the bloc's leader is Ayatollah Ahmad 
Bigdeli 
Azari-Qomi. He is considered one of the influential teachers and 
jurists of the Qom seminary, and is a senior founder of the 
Association of Teachers in Qom, which we can consider to some 
extent the official society of Shiite jurists in Iran.

  [Text] Tehran, 15 Ordibehesht [25 April] -- As of 15 
Farvardin 1373 [4 April 1994] the per-minute telephone rate from 
Iran to other parts of the world was increased based on a 
measure enacted by the Supreme Economic Council. 
  Based on this measure, the new rates will be calculated for 
two time periods, one from 0700 to 2400 and the other, at a 
reduction of 50 percent, from 2400 to 0700. The previous rate, 
which has been in effect since the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 
March 1990], made no distinction between day and night. 
  Part of the recent measure enacted by the Economic Council 
states: 
  1 - The international telephone rates for calls placed by 
subscribers and for calls placed with partial operator 
assistance will go into effect as of 15 Farvardin 1373, and will 
go into effect for cash calls as of the date of the publication 
of these guidelines. 
  2 - Connections made on international calls only will be 
reduced 50 percent from 2400 to 0700 and likewise all day on 
Fridays. 
  3 - In view of the fact that action on international 
telephone taxes will be taken collectively at the central 
office, all money collected for international telephone 
connections will be deposited in the revenues account based on 
the rates given in the enclosed tables. 
  4 - The fees for the contractors at the application centers 
and for the managers at the communications offices will be 
calculated in any case from the international telephone revenues 
after deducting 40 percent. 
  5 - If the last numeral to the right in the figure for the 
total amount due is less than 5 rials [R], then R5 will be 
collected, and if it is between R5 and R10, R10 will be 
collected. 
  According to the new measure, the rate for telephone calls 
will be R1,266 for each minute between Iran and Germany, 
Switzerland, and France; R1,372 per minute to Sweden; R1,380 to 
the Ukraine and Russia; R1,552 to England; R2,068 to the 
Netherlands; R2,068 to Iraq; R1,552 to Saudi Arabia; R3,586 to 
Madagascar; R1,552 to Australia; R2,625 to America; R3,102 to 
Argentina and Mexico; and R4,138 for countries such as Chile and 
Honduras.

<F P=106> [Unnamed interviewer questions Begum Nusrat Bhutto in </F>
Islamabad; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] The meeting was not accidental or coincidental; 
AL-MAJALLAH had requested an interview with Begum Nusrat Bhutto, 
mother of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, to hear of 
the latest developments in Pakistan's political situation. The 
battle is at its fiercest between the opposition, led by former 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, and the People's Party government, 
which returned to power led by a non-iron woman, yet one who has 
firmly established her presence in a country where power has 
always been wielded by men. 
  Nusrat Bhutto is the wife of the respected politician 
Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who was executed by former Pakistani 
President Zia-ul-Haq, on the charge of having carried out the 
murder of a member of the opposition. Her maiden name was Nusrat 
al-Isfahani; she is Iranian, of the Shiite sect. Her husband 
became acquainted with her, then married her. 
  Our meeting with Nusrat Bhutto was at Sindh House in 
Islamabad, which is composed of connected residences for the 
convenience of politicians in this state, seen as the most 
important of Pakistan's states by far, for when they visit the 
new capital established by former Pakistani President General 
Muhammad Ayub Khan in 1964. 
  Nusrat Bhutto looks to be in her early fifties, but is 
actually in her late fifties. She is surrounded by a group of 
male and female attendants, all of whom await her on the lower 
floor, while she prepares herself for a full day on the upper 
floor of one of the residences at Sindh House. [passage ommitted] 
<H5>  Wholesale Accusations </H5>
  We were not with Nusrat Bhutto long before asking about the 
relationship between her and her daughter, though we avoided 
entering too directly into this subject. She embarked on her 
answer as she seated herself in a comfortable chair in a 
beautiful and orderly sitting room: "She will hurt herself. She 
will be the victim of her own unpredictable behavior." 
  Nusrat Bhutto spoke on, ignoring the protests of one of 
those 
present who did not want to turn the session into a discussion 
of family matters. She said, "Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, God rest his 
soul, gave her two pieces of advice: to obey her mother, telling 
her that paradise lies at the feet of mothers, and never to 
distance herself from the poor; to take up their problems and 
issues constantly." 
  She went on to say, with no pause at the remarks and 
gestures 
of those who came in to stop the interview, "She has done the 
exact opposite of what her father advised. She has distanced 
herself from the poor, and surrounded herself with a retinue of 
(former President) Zia-ul-Haq's bunch, and the Reform Party. She 
no longer listens to a word from me, or to one particle of my 
advice." 
  She said that she herself is to blame, because she spoiled 
her daughter Benazir more than necessary, having gotten into the 
habit of refusing her nothing. Nusrat Bhutto said that the poor 
are the ones who had made Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto the leader of 
Pakistan, and that he had focused most of his attention on 
providing every Pakistani with his or her daily bread and 
clothing. 
  She added, with bitter sarcasm, "Zulfiqar was grooming 
Shahnawaz [the son who is said to have committed suicide in 
France some years ago] for leadership and governing. To him, 
Benazir was just a spoiled girl he wanted to be educated, to 
graduate from the finest universities." 
<H5>  Bhutto's Ring </H5>
  Without stopping, without even paying the slightest 
attention 
to the protests of some, Nusrat added that her daughter Benazir 
is "bewitched," and that she became certain of this when she 
sent one of her friends to inspect her bed: "This friend 
actually went and inspected the bed and found twelve fingernails 
painted black in the bedstead over the bed." 
  In a fiery tone she exclaimed, "I never believed these 
things, but I checked myself, and we found these black nails in 
Benazir's bed frame. I took them to a clergyman who is famous 
for fighting evil spirits. He took them and poured a certain oil 
over them, then burned them. At that point I noticed that 
Benazir's behavior changed, and that she had become rational 
again, but that was only temporary." 
  Begum Nusrat told the story of the struggle for leadership 
between the Bhutto family and the family of Benazir's husband. 
She said that her son Murtaza, currently imprisoned in a Sindh 
prison, had asked for his father's ring, which had been kept by 
his sister Benazir after Zulfiqar's execution, "but she put him 
off, procrastinated, and avoided doing it." 
  She continued with this story, which is a highly painful one 
for her, saying, "When I found out that she wanted to keep this 
ring for herself and her children later on, I asked her to give 
it to me temporarily so that I could take it to a jeweler for 
him to make one exactly like it for Mortaza. She refused. I 
found out that she had had made a ring just like it made for her 
son, who is still a young child." 
  Nusrat Bhutto repeated the story of this ring again and 
again, and told how she had given the specifications of the ring 
to a jeweler, and asked him to make one like it based on her 
description, "but the jeweler was not able to. He gave us a ring 
that did not look one thing like Zulfiqar's ring." 
<H5>  Rats in Prison </H5>
  Begum Nusrat moved on from discussing Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's 
ring, which Benazir had insisted on keeping for her and her 
children, to the story of her son Murtaza, who had been 
imprisoned on the charge of hijacking a plane in the early 
1980s. She insisted that the charge was fabricated, and that the 
intention was to put an and to the Bhuttos' rule and finish off 
their political life in Pakistan. 
  The widow of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, and mother of Pakistan's 
prime minister, asserted that she did not want to interfere in 
the case, but that all she was asking was for Benazir to 
intercede to speed up the trial, "because the conditions Murtaza 
is enduring in prison are unbearable. He has been put in a small 
cell, like a criminal's cell." 
  Nusrat Bhutto says that her son told her the water in his 
cell was shut off some time ago, and that he cannot shave 
himself; and that mice and rats can roam freely and play. "We 
asked the director of the prison why there are rats, and he said 
the reason is the changes in the climate. But I found out that 
they brought them on purpose to frighten and terrorize him." 
  Nusrat Bhutto returned to the subject of her daughter, 
describing her as stubborn and moody. "I told you she is 
bewitched. I am afraid she will be murdered, because her enemies 
have been able to infiltrate her entourage, and because she does 
not listen to the advice of her father's friends, who want only 
the best for her." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Nabil Fahmi by Muhammad 'Allam in </F>
Cairo; date not given: "Israeli Arms Policies Geared for 
Conflict, Not Peace"--first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH 
introduction] 
  [Text] Ambassador Nabil Fahmi, head of the Egyptian 
delegation to the arms limitation committee of the multiparty 
talks and political advisor to the Egyptian foreign minister, 
has confirmed that Egypt will not accept Israeli military 
supremacy, from fear of a military confrontation caused by any 
dispute that may occur. He indicates that Egypt is monitoring 
Israel's weapons policies and notices that they "are still 
geared for conflict, not peace." 
  He warns, in an interview with AL-HAYAH, of the danger of 
American arms exceeding the limits of a country's legitimate 
security needs, saying, "When we reach the point of supremacy, 
and an upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of 
danger." He reaffirmed that a continued arms race would lead to 
a political shock in the Middle East, and warned of the 
likelihood of a confrontation that could result in damaging the 
interests of the lesser militarily-superior country. 
  The text of the interview follows: 
  ['Allam] What are the ramifications of the peace process on 
the armament needs of Egypt and other countries in the region? 
Are the factors and motives that defined the quantity and type 
of arms in the past now pass&eacute;, with the advent of a 
comprehensive peace? 
  [Fahmi] Neither Egypt nor any Arab state can accept exposing 
themselves to danger; this is something we insist upon. The 
relevant parties must take whatever steps they see as necessary 
in this regard, because the requirements for legitimate defense 
are a principled requirement, and absolutely cannot be tampered 
with. 
  I believe there is no contradiction between maintaining the 
essentials for legitimate defense, and arms limitation and 
regional security. On the contrary, these two movements are 
congruent, as the concept of peace is based on the balance of 
security needs. The positions and commitments support each 
country's securing its national interests, and handling their 
security needs, in a framework suitable to its economic and 
social requirements. At the same time, we hope that among the 
results of peace will be a reduction in the tension in this 
region and a curb on the tendency of some countries to compete 
in arming themselves, developing arsenals, and introducing 
various new weapons systems. 
  ['Allam] Egypt's motives for arming itself may have changed, 
but Israel's policies are not geared to a change in motives or 
the possibility of changing in the future. 
  [Fahmi] We are monitoring Israel's arms policies, and we 
hope 
that these policies will evolve in conformity with the concept 
of peace. We see no logic or justification calling for military 
supremacy over a neighbor or neighbors, in the context of peace. 
Every party must review its concept of security in a way suited 
to the circumstances of peace and the changes that will occur in 
this region. 
  ['Allam] Egypt proposes the principle of equality of 
balance. 
What is the concept of balance for Egypt--between Israel and 
every Arab party individually, or between Israel and the Arabs 
as a geographical bloc? 
  [Fahmi] Prior to the peace process, there were unacceptable 
pretexts for the balance of Israel's military power with Arab 
military capabilities, as it was an invitation to an arms race. 
After the process, and the positive progress it has achieved on 
all tracks, albeit slowly, we can find absolutely no 
justification for the continuation of these invitations, rooted 
in the theory of conflict. The aim of the talks in the committee 
for arms limitation is a balance of security and equality of 
commitments among neighboring countries, regardless of whether 
they are Arab countries bordering other Arabs, or between Arab 
countries and Israel or other countries. Egypt does not believe 
in the philosophy of balancing blocs versus one state. 
  ['Allam] There will be, within one year, a conference on 
"expanding the validity of the nuclear proliferation treaty." 
Will Egypt sign up to expand the validity or link it to Israel's 
signing the treaty, as is the case with the chemical weapons 
nonproliferation treaty? 
  [Fahmi] We must look positively about the conference, to 
encourage the other countries of the region to join it, instead 
of looking upon it as a group to confront. Egypt calls upon the 
countries of the region, including Israel, to join the treaty, 
as matters will be assessed in light of it in time. It is not 
rational or understandable for any country to maintain the right 
to obtain a certain weapon or remain outside the system of 
banning certain arms, as long as its neighbors also join, 
especially as any arms limitation accord in any field would be 
based on a balance of power and of rights, and the congruence of 
legal commitments among neighboring countries. Egypt's cautious 
position as regards joining the treaty for banning chemical 
weapons is the result of the failure of a certain country to 
move towards compliance with our security demands, or to take 
into consideration some things that worry us in the area of 
securing our interests. 
  ['Allam] Is Egypt disturbed by the fact that some countries 
of the region are still in the arms race, which could some day 
lead to hostile tendencies, and thus a move to build a defense 
and deterrent force, meaning that the multiparty talks are 
futile? 
  [Fahmi] Egypt does not accept that a neighboring country be 
militarily superior to it, because this increases the likelihood 
that that neighboring country would in the future resort to arms 
in the event of a political dispute, and lest circumstances or a 
limited dispute escalate into a military confrontation ending in 
damaging the interests of the lesser militarily-superior 
country. Thus the continuation of the arms race would inevitably 
lead to instability and weakened security, and expose the region 
to a political shock. 
  ['Allam] Are conventional weapons still Egypt's major 
alternative in the event Israel persists in refusing to sign the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty? 
  [Fahmi] Conventional weapons comprise the basic component in 
guaranteed legitimate defense, according to the United Nations 
charter. We hope that these weapons will remain the basic 
systems, meaning that we do not want things to go farther, with 
any country in the region beginning to introduce the nuclear 
factor into its security calculations. This would lead to a 
security imbalance that would be very hard to correct, and we do 
not believe that there is any chance for arms limitation 
measures or security arrangements if any country in the region 
retains the nuclear option. 
  ['Allam] Does Egypt think that the United States, the major 
supplier of arms to the countries of the Third World, will have 
a role in stopping the arms race? 
  [Fahmi] Some countries obtain their arms from the United 
States and other countries, and these are legitimate security 
needs. But when when we reach the point of supremacy, and an 
upset in the balance, then we have reached a point of danger, 
linked not only to the arms a country imports, but to other 
factors, such as local production and military capability. 
  This is the responsibility of the United States, in arms 
limitation and regional arrangements in the Middle East, as the 
major sponsor of the peace process. I do not, however, agree 
with the attempts of some to assess the security of any country 
based solely on the arms it purchases. It is not possible to 
deal with this topic by banning the importation or sale of arms; 
we must look at all aspects, such as the country's capacity to 
manufacture arms and what it imports, as well as the types of 
these arms, and the arms it exports to other countries. 
  ['Allam] The Cairo meetings last December, between rounds of 
the arms limitation talks, turned up disputes in points of 
view--what are they? What are the major topics to be at the Doha 
meeting? 
  [Fahmi] There were differences, but not disputes. This is 
natural, as the meetings are part of the first phase of 
negotiations in this area. They came up in the area of the 
committee's work priorities, as some countries focused on 
confidence-building measures such as contacts, exchange of 
information, and arrangements regarding military forces. Other 
countries, mostly Arab countries, including Egypt, saw no 
contradiction between the pursuance of confidence-building 
measures and the initiation of the arms limitation process now. 
  Despite these differences, the Cairo meeting was positive 
and 
constructive. Progress was made towards agreement on a regional 
security declaration, and arms limitation, including special 
principles for security and arms limitation, and its priorities 
and ultimate objectives. We hope to reach a final agreement on 
this declaration in the Doha meetings. 
  ['Allam] Will the Arab joint defense accord be nullified if 
regional security arrangements are reached in the multiparty 
talks? 
  [Fahmi] With the development of circumstances in the region, 
we will find ways of reconciling the new arrangements with the 
existing ones. There are numerous ways, not only this 
agreement--measures that support each other as long as they tend 
to defend legitimate and legal positions and principles. The 
matter of canceling the agreement concerns only the member 
states of the Arab League, and will be studied, as these states 
see this in the context of the League and not of the arms 
limitation committee.

  [Text] As soon as the first and most important 
Palestinian-Jordanian private sector company was declared, 
Faysal al-Husayni proposed that a Palestinian-Arab-international 
conference be held in Jerusalem to develop the holy city and to 
"create Palestinian facts" [on the ground]. 
  If PEDRA [Palestinian Economic Development and 
Reconstruction 
Agency] is tantamount to our national authority's public sector, 
and subsequently our newborn state's public sector, then the 
founding of the Palestine Development and Investment Company on 
23 March [1994] lays down the cornerstone of a new private 
sector so as to complete the building of a national economic 
structure. This structure is to undertake the burdens and tasks 
of correcting the distortions inflicted by the occupation on the 
economy of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip; to draft the 
development strategies of the future Palestine; and to form an 
important tributary of future development in the homeland. It is 
hoped that the private sector will secure 60 percent of the 
investment resources needed for the Palestinian development 
program, whose total costs are estimated on the basis of this 
year's prices at $13.4 billion, of which $11.6 billion is for 
basic costs, i.e., $1.16 billion annually, plus 12 percent to 
cover inflation and 10 percent added to the total as reserves in 
anticipation of the possible need for investment allocations 
exceeding the current estimates. 
  Perhaps many people recall the complications engulfing 
PEDRA's formation last October and the struggle the PLO 
leadership waged in connection with this agency's makeup with 
the IMF and with some parties planning to grant aid to the 
self-rule authorities in Gaza and Jericho. Numerous objections 
were raised against PEDRA's makeup, expressing the opinion that 
this makeup favored politicians at the expense of economists and 
specialists. The PLO's official position was expressed in a 
phrase uttered by Chairman 'Arafat who said, "I will not be 
another Gorbachev." One should keep in mind, however, that some 
Palestinian circles concerned responded positively to these 
objections! 
  The Palestine Development and Investment Company, which has 
received the PLO's support and backing since it emerged as an 
idea nearly a year ago, is tantamount to a melting pot for 
attracting and organizing Palestinian resources and capabilities 
inside and outside the occupied homeland. The purpose is to 
enable this company to contribute to building the edifice of our 
newborn state and to motivate other Palestinian parties and 
notables to emulate this company's constituent assembly, each 
party in its field of specialization and according to the 
formula that it deems fit. 
  The idea of the company was born nearly a year ago and a 
constituent committee was formed for the purpose under the 
chairmanship of Munib al-Misri, a well-known Palestinian 
businessman. It was agreed that the company's capital would be 
$200 million and that a number of Palestinian businessmen and 
financial institutions inside and outside the homeland would 
contribute to this capital. The constituent committee included 
Munib al-Misri; Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman of the Amman 
Chamber of Industry; 'Abd-al-Majid Shuman as representative of 
the Arab Bank; Kamal al-Sha'ir as representative of the 
Engineering House; and Kamal Hassunah and 'Awni al-Misri of the 
Cairo-Amman Bank. 
  When the necessary preparations were completed, the 
company's 
constituent conference was held on 23 March [1994] at the 
offices of the Amman Chamber of Industry in Amman, Jordan's 
capital. The conference was attended by brother Abu-al-'Ala', 
Fatah Central Committee member and head of the PLO Economic 
Department, who delivered an address on behalf of Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat. The conference was also attended by brother Faysal 
al-Husayni, chairman of the Palestinian negotiating delegation's 
steering committee; Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, the Jordanian 
information minister; and al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim, the 
Palestinian ambassador to Jordan and Fatah Central Committee 
member. 
<H5>  Abu-'Ala': Six Strategies </H5>
  In the address he delivered on behalf of brother Abu-'Ammar, 
brother Abu-al-'Ala' paused before three main pivots on occasion 
of "celebration of the launching of the first and most important 
Palestinian private sector establishment." These pivots are: 
first, goals of development in Palestine; second, development 
strategies in Palestine; and, third, investment resources 
necessary for the Palestinian development program. Abu-al-'Ala' 
noted that the details of this development program are available 
at the PLO's Economic Department. 
  Regarding the first pivot, brother Abu-al-'Ala' defined the 
economic and social development goals and priorities of the new 
Palestinian political entity and its national authority, both of 
which will lead the economy and the society to achieve the 
following: 
  1. Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks 
experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the 
occupation and of its actions. 
  2. Expand and improve the material, economic, and social 
infrastructure. 
  3. Create a large number of work opportunities in the fields 
of production, service, and others in order to absorb the 
workforce suffering from unemployment. 
  4. Promote export-generating sectorsm which have the 
intrinsic capability of earning foreign currency (tourism, for 
example). 
  5. Meet our people's human needs in the areas of food, 
clothing, housing, education, health, and other services. 
  6. Gain and resettle an effective technological capability, 
considering that education, teaching, and training are three 
meshed priorities in the program. 
  7. Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to 
take part in all development opportunities freely and to 
participate in constructing 185,000 new housing units in order 
to make up for the shortfall in the area of housing and to 
absorb repatriates. 
  8. Seek to achieve balance and equality between men and 
women 
and between the various districts and social and economic groups. 
  As for Palestine's development strategies, they must be 
selected carefully and correctly and they must include a number 
of strategies that contribute to enhancing and diversifying 
production. These strategies include: 
  The first strategy calls for efforts to: 
  A. Establish a rational balance between agriculture and 
industry. 
  B. Establish a rational balance between exports and imports. 
  C. Make maximum use of land and water resources. 
  D. Strengthen the bond and the interaction between the 
various sectors. 
  E. Select the appropriate technology for all branches of the 
economy with utter care. 
  F. Set up the establishments, centers, and frameworks that 
support the economic activity. 
  Second strategy: it is embodied in the maximum mobilization 
of the capacities and abilities of the diaspora Palestinians to 
participate seriously in the building processes. This means 
attracting significant assistance in the areas of finance, 
investment, and in educational, administrative, and scientific 
technology. 
  Third strategy: it is embodied in adopting the course of 
self-reliance within the context of collective (i.e., Arab) 
reliance. This does not mean retreating into a shell but rather 
resorting to the maximal mobilization and use of society's 
capabilities on sound bases and principles. 
  Fourth strategy: it is embodied in taking advantage of Arab 
and international aid, with controls to ensure the sound and 
correct implementation of projects. 
  The fifth strategy calls for respecting human rights and the 
citizen's right to enjoy the basic freedoms and to participate 
in politics on the basis of democracy and plurality. 
  Sixth, and final, strategy: it calls for the full 
utilization 
of the traditions that motivate and promote development as a 
consequence of the feeling of liberation and freedom from 
occupation and of the aspiration to build a homeland. 
  The Palestinian official also emphasized the importance of 
creating a market economy and the importance of practicing 
plurality and democracy to avoid the dangers of the single 
opinion and, consequently, to ensure that all society 
participates in shouldering the responsibility. Abu-al-'Ala' 
also noted the importance of understanding the nature of the 
special laws and economic conditions in the transitional phase, 
which will be governed by the Declaration of Principles. But the 
conditions will be [ultimately] determined by our action, by the 
way we build our institutions and systems, and by their ability 
to bring about practical change on the real ground. 
  Munib al-Misri, the committee chairman, spoke in his address 
about the company's tasks and priorities, defining six of them, 
just for example. These are: 
  1. The company will participate in Arab-Palestinian 
joint-stock companies to be founded in the Palestinian 
territories to participate with the private sector 
effectively--the first of which will be the Palestine Pioneers 
Investment Company; to implement economic plans capable of 
correcting the flaw that has hit the economic structure 
throughout the past decades; and to execute a large number of 
economic projects that are expected to exceed $1 billion in 
value. 
  2. The company will aid industries that exist in Palestine 
currently--especially small industries--financially, 
administratively, and technically. 
  3. It will launch efforts to encourage the private sector to 
play a a role that supports and complements the public sector so 
as to contribute to building the future state. 
  4. It will work to improve the investment climate so as to 
attract Palestinian, Arab, and international investments. 
  5. In designing the company's legal structure and the 
structure of other domestic joint-stock subsidiaries that 
emanate from it, we have taken into account expansion of the 
participation base so that the largest number possible of our 
kinsmen can contribute directly to the economic development 
process, provided that no single individual's participation 
exceeds 1-percent of the company capital. The objective is to 
provide the opportunity to everybody. 
  6. The joint-stock Palestine Development and Investment 
Company will seek to achieve balanced development that 
encompasses all economic sectors, with redoubled emphasis on the 
production sectors which possess favorable advantages, 
especially the industry, tourism, and construction sectors. The 
objective is to provide extensive work opportunities, to boost 
the existing industries, to implement projects that contribute 
to the transfer of technology, and to achieve high added values.

<F P=106> [Article by Khalid al-Zubaydi] </F>
  [Text] The first and biggest Palestinian holding company, 
with a capital of 200 million dinars [currency as published], 
has emerged at the Amman Chamber of Industry with the 
participation of Palestinian, Jordanian, and Arab banks, 
companies, and investment figures. The company, considered a 
distinguished private sector effort, seeks to establish 
investment projects in the Palestinian-Arab territories. 
  Participants in the constituent meeting viewed the launching 
of the Palestine Development and Investment Company as a part of 
Palestine's modern history and as an important step in the 
direction of a market economy, which is embraced by the 
Palestinian leadership as a path, according to Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-al-'Ala'). 
  Sources of the [company's] constituent committee have 
estimated the volume of investments expected to be contributed 
by the Palestine Company at $1 billion. Raja'i al-Misri, the 
company spokesman, has asserted that the constituent assembly 
has developed initial ideas for a long list of projects. He has 
also estimated the company's investments in the first year at 
nearly $200 million. 
  In response to a question by AL-RA'Y, al-Misri pointed out 
that the company's Executive Board is inclined to invite 
[public] subscription for 49 percent of the capital of the 
Palestine Pioneers Establishment as a first practical step on 
the company's part. 
  Dr. Jawad al-'Anani, Jordan's information minister and 
minister of state for cabinet affairs, expressed hope that the 
company will accomplish its tasks of developing Palestine; 
creating work opportunities for those who seek them; and 
expanding the spheres of fruitful investment. He also asserted 
Jordan's support for development and reconstruction efforts in 
the occupied territories. 
  Dr. al-'Anani also noted that economic relations between 
Jordan and the occupied territories have continued to exist by 
virtue of fundamental factors, asserting that these relations 
must continue so they will remain a firm barrier in the face of 
Israel's schemes to maintain the status quo of the Palestinian 
economy. 
  He reminded us of the comprehensive economic agreement 
concluded between Jordan and the PLO and said, "Creation of the 
Palestine Company embodies the form of relations toward which we 
aspire and creates a harmonious reality which Israel cannot 
infiltrate." 
  Al-'Anani noted that Jordan's and Palestine's private 
sectors 
are capable of being pioneers and foresighted initiative-makers 
that play a role in building the Palestinian economy and in 
turning it into a bridge for greater Arab unity. 
<H5>  More Important Event </H5>
  Abu-al-'Ala', who delivered an address on behalf of 
Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, considered the foundation of 
the Palestine Company as the most important event since 
conclusion of the Declaration of Principles in Washington. 
  He said that this private sector initiative will have a 
great 
impact on economic and social development activities in the 
Palestinian homeland. It will also have the greatest impact in 
preparing and revitalizing the Palestinian private sector at 
home and abroad to play a role in and to contribute to the 
development activities. Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that this good 
initiative will receive full support and backing from the 
Palestinian authority and its institutions and from the 
Palestinian people's institutions inside and outside the 
occupied homeland. 
  He added that the size of the challenges facing Palestinians 
in the coming phase is only matched by the size of the hopes and 
expectations. He said that these challenges are the challenges 
to build institutions of civilization on the ground according to 
the most modern principles and to create a system that embraces 
democracy and plurality as its path and joint economic 
development and growth as its course. Moreover, these challenges 
are also challenges of the ability to ensure stability and 
security. 
  Abu-'Ala' summed up the goals and priorities of development 
in Palestine, saying that they must be designed to befit the 
conditions of a people who have experienced and who continue to 
experience great hardship as a result of the hateful occupation. 
They must also be designed to befit a totally new political 
entity that is in the phase of creation. These goals seek to: 

  -  Correct the distortions, flaws, and bottlenecks 
experienced by the Palestinian economy as a result of the 
occupation and of its actions. 
  -  Expand and improve the infrastructure. 
  -  Create work opportunities to absorb the unemployed. 
  -  Encourage export and foreign currency generating sectors. 
  -  Work to meet the Palestinian people's basic needs. 
  -  Gain and resettle an effective technological capability, 
considering that education, teaching, and training are three 
meshed priorities. 
  -  Encourage the private sector and open the door for it to 
participate in all branches of construction and development and 
to contribute promptly to the construction of 185,000 housing 
units in order to meet the shortage in the housing area and to 
absorb repatriates. 
  -  Seek equality and balance between men and women and between 
the 
various districts and social and economic groups. 

  Regarding the development strategies for Palestine, 
Abu-'Ala' 
said that they must achieve balance between agriculture and 
industry, exports and imports. They must also make maximum use 
of land and water; must strengthen bonds and interaction between 
the various sectors; must select the appropriate technology for 
all branches of the economy; and must set up the institutions, 
centers, and frameworks that support economic activity. The 
strategies must, moreover, mobilize the resources and 
capabilities of the diaspora Palestinians; must attract 
financial, investment, and technological, educational, and 
administrative aid; must strengthen self-reliance within the 
framework of collective (i.e., Arab) reliance, without 
retreating into a shell; and must benefit from Arab and 
international aid. 
  Abu-'Ala' estimated the total investments needed for the 
Palestinian development program at $11.6 billion, plus 12 
percent to face inflation and 10 percent added to the total as 
reserves. All of this raises the total amount needed, at 1994 
prices, to $13.4 billion, of which the private sector 
contributions will constitute nearly 60 percent. 
<H5>  Market Economy Is Our Option </H5>
  Before a crowd of more than 200 businessmen and investors, 
Abu-'Ala' declared, "We aspire for an economic system that 
epitomizes the greatest and most successful experiments; 
achieves justice, prosperity, and constant growth; and releases 
individual initiative--a system that is founded on frankness, 
explicitness, openness, and accountability; that benefits from 
our people's competence and capability; and that always works to 
develop them. 
  Abu-al-'Ala' noted that other people's experiences have 
proved that the rules and laws of the market economy are the 
best motivators of people's economies and capabilities and are 
the most successful in economic growth and development processes. 
  Concluding, Abu-al-'Ala' asserted that the Palestine 
Investment Company [Palestine Development and Investment 
Company] initiative will have an important role in the 
construction and development activities and in motivating the 
Palestinian, Arab, and international private sector to invest in 
Palestine. Through interaction with the Palestinian national 
authority, the company will play an important role that benefits 
this authority. 
<H5>  Correction of Historical Flaw </H5>
  Munib al-Misri, a major shareholder and a constituent 
committee member, said that the idea of founding the Palestinie 
Investment Company with a capital of 200 million dinars 
[currency as published] was developed nearly a year ago with 
brothers from Palestine. He asserted that the company will 
participate in Arab-Palestinian firms that will be founded in 
the Palestinian lands to play an effective role with the private 
sector in implementing the economic plan. This plan is capable 
of correcting the flaw that has afflicted the economic structure 
in recent decades and of reviving the Palestinian economy 
through the implementation of a large number of economic 
projects, expected to exceed $1 billion in value and to have a 
cumulative effect on the society and the economy. The company 
will also support the industries that currently exist in 
Palestine--especially small industries--financially, 
administratively, and technically. 
  Munib al-Misri added that the company will encourage the 
private sector to play its role of supporting and complementing 
the public sector so as to contribute to building the 
independent state and to fulfilling our Palestinian people's 
social and economic development aspirations. The company will 
also work to improve the investment climate so as to attract 
Palestinian, Arab, and international capital. A number of 
factors have been taken into account in designing the company's 
structure and the structure of the domestic joint-stock 
subsidiaries emanating from it. These include expanding the 
participation base to open it to everybody, provided that no one 
individual investor is allowed to participate with more than 1 
percent of the company capital. Foundation of the Palestine 
Company for Development and Investment and of subsidiaries 
emanating from it is tantamount to providing practical 
encouragement to the extensive expertise, capabilities, and 
economic presence of Palestinian investors in the diaspora and 
to their Arab brothers, as well as to the brothers inside 
Palestine. 
  Munib al-Misri noted that, with the election of the 
executive 
board, detailed studies will be completed on a number of 
important economic projects. The company has conducted 
preliminary studies on the feasibility of these projects from 
several aspects. The projects include the construction of 
housing complexes outside urban areas, each consisting of 1,000 
housing units and containing all the necessary utilities. The 
company has also conducted studies to make a determination on 
basic industrial projects. To be feasible, these projects have 
to be generally beneficial to a large number of citizens and 
free of market risks because they are basic projects. 
  Concluding, al-Misri noted that the citizen is the true 
wealth. He praised the Palestinian people's capabilities and 
sacrifices, saying that if high capabilities are utilized well 
in the construction and production process they will provide 
bright opportunities and economic future. He asserted that the 
private sector can accomplish this goal, considering that this 
sector has proved under the most difficult circumstances that it 
is the forerunner in taking the initiative and that it is 
creative and innovative. 
<H5>  Entrenchment of Jerusalem's Arabism </H5>
  Faysal al-Husayni, head of the steering committee of the 
Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations, delivered 
Jerusalem's address. He asserted: "We are convinced that it is 
possible to get Gaza with or without negotiations. The West Bank 
can be gotten with negotiations. As for Jerusalem, it will not 
be available with negotiations alone but rather with 
negotiations and with a fait accompli." 
  He added: "To win the Jerusalem battle, we are required to 
establish in our conscience and in the consciences of the 
Israelis and the world that Jerusalem is Arab and the capital of 
the State of Palestine. It will be won with a religious fait 
accompli or with a political and economic fait accompli." 
  Al-Husayni warned of the swift steps being taken by the 
Israelis in an attempt to isolate Jerusalem, saying, "Despite 
our difficult circumstances and weakness, we were able in 1967 
to impose certain important things, such as administration of 
al-Aqsa Mosque, religious courts, and religious trusts. All are 
managed by an Arab, not Israeli, presence. [passage 
unintelligible]. 
  Al-Husayni renewed the call to Palestinian businessmen and 
investors to revive the plan for an international investment 
conference in Jerusalem so as to bolster the Arab-Palestinian 
reality in Jerusalem and to implant in the mind of the world and 
of the Israelis that this Jerusalem is the capital of Palestine 
and so as not to leave to the Israelis the task of organizing 
international meetings and symposiums on Jerusalem's soil. 
<H5>  Company Is Tantamount to Accepting Challenge </H5>
  In his capacity as a founder, Khaldun Abu-Hassan, chairman 
of 
the Amman Chamber of Industry, said before businessmen and the 
constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for Development 
and Investment: "It is our duty in this homeland to take the 
initiative and to roll up our sleeves so we will be the vanguard 
in rebuilding the wounded Palestine." He added: "You are the 
elite, not just with your economic expertise but also with your 
noble character, your firm patriotism, and your true zeal to 
employ your capabilities in order to set up an Arab organization 
that is prepared and eligible to build and to develop on firm 
and solid bases." 
  Abu-Hassan further added, "After considering the goals, 
means, and methods carefully, we decided to establish the 
Palestine Company for Development and Investment as a holding 
company so it will form an effective factor that turns the wheel 
of development and accepts the challenge of rebuilding the 
Palestinian economy and of mending the wide fissure that has 
developed in the Palestinian economic structure as a result of 
occupation throughout recent decades. This occupation has 
destroyed the production installations, structure, and 
utilities, and whatever pertains to them." He also said, "By 
coming forth to establish this company, we direct our attention 
at the sacred goal of reviving constructive life in the 
Palestinian citizen on the Palestinian soil. Through this 
company, we seek to create an investment climate in the areas of 
industry, tourism, food production, and of other projects that 
produce and create work opportunities; that meet the citizen's 
needs; and that enhance his standard of living." 
<H5>  Uniting Goal and Interest </H5>
  Kamal Hassunah, general director of the Palestinian Pioneers 
Establishment and a constituent assembly member, presented a 
quick review of the Palestinian investment horizons. He said 
that the 1990s have experienced fundamental developments that 
are still affecting the entire world, including collapse of the 
Soviet Union, unification of the two Germanies, the Gulf war, 
the Middle East peace plans, and economic developments toward 
bloc formation, such as the American NAFTA, the European Common 
Market, the Asian Tigers, and others. 
  Hassunah said that these immense and unprecedented 
developments "have imposed enormous challenges also. To confront 
this new reality, where do we stand vis-a-vis these developments 
and changes? Does the Arab environment promote change and 
development?" 
  He stressed that many things depend on this review, most 
significantly the increased chances for success of big companies 
and the exposure of small and medium companies to losses or 
risks of losses if they fail to unite in the next five or 10 
years in order to adapt to the international economic 
developments. 
  Hassunah said that if normal circumstances are made 
available 
to Palestinians, then "we are capable of succeeding in the 
development process through fruitful cooperation between the 
interior and the diaspora, by uniting in common goal and 
interest after a long absence of more than 40 years in the 
diaspora, and by bolstering the confidence and inspired spirit 
of the Palestinians at home." 
  The constituent assembly of the Palestine Company for 
Development and Investment elected a 16-member executive board. 
This board held its first meeting and elected Dr. Kamal 
al-Sha'ir as chairman, Munib al-Misri as deputy chairman, and 
Nabil al-Sarraf as secretary. The executive board has been 
formed of the following: 
  A member representing the Arab Bank; a member representing 
the Cairo-Amman Bank; a member representing the Housing Bank; a 
representative of the Engineering House Company, namely Dr. 
Kamal al-Sha'ir; a member representing al-Masirah Investment 
Company; a member representing al-Sa'id Company; Husayn 
al-Sharqawi; Khaldun Abu-Hassan; Riyadh Sadiq; Ramzi Dalul; Zahi 
Khuri; 'Azmi 'Abd-al-Hadi; Munib al-Misri; Nabil al-Sarraf; 
Nabil al-Shawwa; and Nidhal Sakhiyan.

<F P=106> [Article by Haytham Rashid: "Internal Hamas and External </F>
Hamas"] 
  [Excerpt] An examination of the position of Hamas toward 
the peace process shows clearly that there are some differences 
between Hamas' comprehensive position abroad and Hamas' position 
inside Palestine. These differences are evident in the tone with 
which the peace process is "rejected." 
  In the dialect of the entire external Hamas, rejection 
surfaces firmly and strongly. Rather, this tone harbors within 
its folds the features of a warning to the process supporters, 
whereas the tone of internal Hamas is characterized by 
moderation and projected with a sportsman-like spirit. 
  The question that may occur to observers is: Is this 
difference a sign of a hidden and concealed split between Hamas' 
internal and external wings, or is it tantamount to a 
well-studied tactic that serves a specific purpose in the 
rhetoric with which the masses are addressed. 
  To dot the i's and cross the t's, one must note the surprise 
which has resurfaced among observers now that the internal Hamas 
has clung to the principle of democratic opposition to the 
accord, declaring explicitly that its opposition has its 
redline, which is not to let opposition reach the point of 
internecine fighting and the use of violence between 
Palestinians. This surprise emanates from the fact that even 
before the peace process, violent opposition and clashes 
occurred because of issues much less significant than the 
process. 
  The answer to this particular surprise leads to a basic 
fact, 
namely that the internal Hamas is fully aware of the proverb 
that, "He who receives the lashes is not like him who counts 
them." What this means is that even though the internal Hamas is 
in full agreement with the strategic position of the external 
Hamas, the former sees, with its awareness of the Palestinian 
people's real situation, that the "pain here is very great" and 
that the "majority of the Palestinian people," like Hamas, want 
their full rights. However, the people realize that within the 
given facts of the situation, it is impossible to attain this 
goal within the foreseeable future. 
  It is certain that the people of the internal Hamas have 
developed the conviction that they, like all other Palestinians, 
are Palestinian in pain and hardship and that, simultaneously, 
they are Hamas people who, like all other Hamas people, cling to 
Hamas' strategy. This means that the internal Hamas realizes 
that the Palestinian people must not be pushed to the point of 
suicide and extinction and that, if there is a chance for ways 
of surviving the stormy sea of annihilation, then one must cling 
to them. I believe that with this move, Hamas adheres to its 
Palestinianism. Simultaneously, Hamas is fully eager to cling, 
along with its people, to the means of survival (the process), 
but without declaring that it is accountable for what follows. 
With this move, the internal Hamas maintains its lines of 
communication with the comprehensive Hamas strategy. 
  One cannot interpret this position as being the result of 
Hamas' splitting into two parts. Rather, one can interpret it as 
part of the phenomenon of unity of the Palestinians on the need 
to preserve their survival as a people. The internal Hamas that 
is opposed to the accord, like the side that supports it, agrees 
that the Oslo solution erodes numerous Palestinian constants. 
However, it is certain that the Palestinian people at home want 
a breather. 
  This position by Hamas toward the entire Palestinian 
situation, Hamas' adoption of a sportsman-like spirit in 
opposition, and its decision to avoid internecine fighting among 
Palestinians, all will leave their imprint on the future of the 
coming Palestinian entity, meaning that the internal Hamas will 
include preserving the Palestinian people's survival as a 
priority in its agenda. This question of keeping the Palestinian 
people within the bounds of the possible is some sort of a bond 
which, in my opinion, will enhance the Palestinian people's 
chance to prove to the world that they are capable of building a 
state, which is one of their rights in the first place. 
  A meaningful summary of all we have said is that the hand of 
the internal Hamas, like that of Palestinians, is in the fire. 
The more Hamas crystallizes this fact in positions reflecting a 
sportsman-like spirit, the closer it will find itself to others, 
even to those who support the settlement, because [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Sabina Sehgal Saikia: "Dalai To Make Bangalore </F>
HQ"] 
  [Text] Dharamsala, May 7. 
  The Nobel peace prize winner, the Dalai Lama, has decided to 
shift his headquarters from the hill town of Dharamsala. In all 
probability, the spiritual and temporal head of the Tibetans 
will move his base to the outskirts of Bangalore. This decision 
follows a spate of violence, arson and looting which the Tibetan 
community in Dharamsala has been subjected to in the last 
fortnight. 
  The Dalai Lama made his decision known when the former BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] chief minister, Mr. Shanta Kumar, 
visited him at his residence in the presence of this 
correspondent. Mr. Shanta Kumar apologised for the violence 
which followed the death of a Gaddi youth at the hands of a 
Tibetan. The movement against the Tibetans has, much to the 
embarrassment of the BJP, been spear-headed by the party's local 
MLA [member of Legislative Assembly], Mr. Krishen Kapoor. 
  Later, in an exclusive interview, the Dalai Lama expressed 
his deep hurt at the manner in which the Tibetans had been 
stone-walled by sections of the local community. "I am very, 
very sad that an individual incident has, unfortunately, been 
allowed to be manipulated by local politicians and this makes it 
very serious," he said. "Perhaps in a small town, the presence 
of a few thousand Tibetans is conspicuous. My presence here and 
that of the central administration, too, makes the Tibetans here 
stand out. To avoid a conflict becoming a major problem in the 
future, it is best that I move out of Dharamsala," he said. 
  Expressing his deep gratitude to the Indian government for 
providing refuge to almost 100,000 Tibetans (of which 6,000 live 
in Dharamsala), the Dalai Lama, however, clarified that the 
choice of Dharamsala as his base was not one taken by him out of 
choice. "It was at the insistence of the Government of India in 
1960, when I was informed that Mussourie was only a temporary 
arrangement, that I shifted to Dharamsala with reluctance. I 
have always been in favour of being closer to Delhi," he said. 
  He added that on every subsequent occasion when he had 
attempted to move out of Dharamsala -- to Simla in the '60s and 
later in 1988 when his community felt that earthquake-prone 
Dharamsala was unsafe for him -- the local community had 
appealed to him not to shift his residence. "But this time I 
have been faced with a human earth-quake -- I think the time has 
come for me to move and, if possible, I will move to Bangalore," 
he informed. 
  The decision of the Dalai Lama has taken the local Tibetan 
community, and his government-in-exile, by shock. For many, this 
has been their only home since their flight from Tibet almost 35 
years ago. But, as the elderly Ms. Kunga whose shop was looted 
and attacked by an unruly mob, points out, "I have never felt 
more intimidated -- not even by the Chinese." 
  The situation in the hill-resort has remained tense despite 
section 144 being revoked on April 27. While there has been no 
fresh spate of violence against the Tibetans, every new day 
witnesses a fresh turn to the current impasse. Just yesterday, 
Dharamsala awoke to pamphlets strewn all over the 
Tibetan-dominated McLeod Gunj area which screamed in Hindi, 
"This is a special warning to all Tibetans. If you people do not 
leave Dharamsala by July 25, we will bomb you out..." This is in 
addition to a series of memorandums and resolutions which the 
local politicians have been regularly signing asking for the 
immediate expulsion of Tibetans from Dharamsala. 
  Despite this, the local administration refuses to accept 
that 
there is any cause for concern. The deputy commissioner, Ms. 
Manisha Sridhar, when contacted, said, "I do not think that this 
is a big issue -- it can easily be sorted out. I think that the 
press has unnecessarily blown it up." While admitting the 
incidents of arson, violence and looting, Ms. Sridhar, however, 
felt that it would be unwise for her to make any immediate 
arrests against those who led the mobs as it might aggravate the 
tension. She informed that 14 reserves of police force had been 
placed on duty as a precautionary measure. 
  The local politicians -- both Mr. Kapoor of the BJP and Ms. 
Chandresh Kumari of the Congress -- remain vituperative in their 
attack against the Tibetans, accusing them of everything from 
drug and arms smuggling to being condescending and insensitive 
to the local population.

<F P=106> [Article: "Jobs: Disparity Between Placements and Job </F>
Supply"] 
  [Text] The National Employment Agency (ANEM) says the 
disparity is explained by employers' need for workers with 
skills. 
  While 36,537 employment applications were recorded in fourth 
quarter 1993, only 12,383 jobs were offered and 10,030 
placements were made, according to statistics from ANEM. 
Examination of ANEM's statistics shows that only about one out 
of three applications was successful and about one out of four 
job seekers placed. 
  The 19-percent disparity between placements and supply is 
explained, according to the agency, by employers' need for 
employees with professional experience and seniority. 
  A breakdown of the statistics on job seekers (36,537), whose 
numbers were up 17.61 percent from the previous quarter, shows 
only 16.24 percent were women, while 83.76 percent were men. 
Nearly half the job seekers (46.32 percent) were youths aged 16 
to 25. 
  Close to 5 percent of applicants are university level, 24.10 
percent have no education, 48.80 percent have a primary school 
education, and 21.96 percent have some secondary schooling. ANEM 
notes a 47.42-percent increase in job applications from persons 
who have university degrees. Job seekers with some middle-school 
or high-school education were even more numerous during the 
period, their numbers increasing respectively 20.8 and 40.1 
percent from third quarter 1993. 
  However, 54 percent of applicants have no skills and 40.53 
percent are highly skilled workers or foremen, while high-level 
technicians and managerial personnel accounted for only 5.42 
percent of employment applications. 
  Out of the total supply of jobs (12,383), a figure that was 
21.5 percent larger than the corresponding third quarter figure, 
only 43.72 percent were for permanent positions, compared to 
56.28 for temporary employment. Buildings and public works and 
industry were the biggest purveyors of employment, accounting 
for 41.86 and 33 percent of total supply, respectively. 
  Growth in these two sectors was 7.5 and 17.5 percent, 
respectively. Agriculture has also seen a tangible increase in 
positions available (up 97.36 percent), while ANEM reports a 
28-percent decline in the transport sector. With regard to 
placements (10,030, up 17.5 percent), the agency noted that 
85.51 percent of jobs went to men, against 14.49 percent that 
went to women. According to ANEM, the difference is explained by 
the nature of specific position requirements. Also, 80.68 
percent of total placements were with public-sector employers, 
versus 15.12 percent with domestic private employers, and 4.20 
percent with foreign private-sector firms. 
  Of jobs actually filled, 39.07 percent (3,919 jobs) were 
permanent in nature, while 60.93 percent (6,111 jobs) were 
temporary. 
<H5>  Foreigners Hired </H5>
  During fourth quarter, work authorizations were approved for 
1,056 foreigners, a 6.63-percent increase over the previous 
quarter. 
  Workers from the CIS were the largest group with 209 
authorizations, followed by Moroccans with 160 and Frenchmen 
with 100. 
  Eighty authorizations were approved for Italians, 58 for 
Tunisians, 36 for Spaniards, and 35 for Americans. The other 378 
were divided among a number of nationalities. ANEM indicated 
that during the same period 417 new work permits were delivered, 
481 renewed, and 158 declarations recorded for French and 
Tunisian workers, who are not subject to work permits (100 for 
Frenchmen and 58 for Tunisians). 
  Also, 577 breaches of contract were recorded, and 10 work 
permits refused.

<F P=106> [Article: "Housing Shortage, Health Sector Problems"] </F>
  [Text] It has been learned there is a shortage of 1.2 
million housing units... 
  In less than two days, the new head of government has 
conferred with officials in two sectors where the alarm bells 
are already ringing. 
  Mr. Mokdad Sifi intends to make the health and housing 
sectors important policy areas. The housing issue was discussed 
yesterday at Government House, at the prime minister's meeting 
with several members of the government and officials in 
concerned departments. 
  The meeting afforded an opportunity for a diagnosis of ills 
plaguing the sector. 
  It was disclosed there is a shortage of 1.2 million housing 
units, while the rate of construction is at best 40,000 units 
per year, though the pace was as high as 90,000 in the early 
1980's. 
  Also, it was reported that the productive plant as a whole 
is 
in sad shape, as a result of swollen personnel ranks and a 
deficit equal to 130 percent of annual turnover. 
  Emphasis was placed on the inadequacy and irregularity that 
plague provisioning of construction materials, a commercial 
sector where 55 billion centimes are siphoned off by various 
intermediaries. 
  Also raised was the issue of insufficient land on which to 
build, owing to cumbersome regulations, confusion regarding the 
roles played by various administrative offices, and inconsistent 
financing practices. 
  This review of the state of affairs led several meeting 
participants to advance a number of suggestions to facilitate 
implementation of the current housing program and rapid 
completion of urban development plans for all urban 
concentrations of more than 50,000 inhabitants. 
  It was decided to establish intersectoral working groups 
with 
a view to resolving, on an urgent basis and within a specific 
timeframe, the diverse bottlenecks in land availability, 
financing, construction materials, and production plant. 
  At the end of the meeting, the head of government also 
pledged to organize a second meeting to evaluate the work 
accomplished and take the most appropriate practical steps to 
revive the housing sector. 
  Several initiatives need to be approved--and implemented--to 
get the sector out of its present quagmire. These include easing 
financial constraints that weigh on housing enterprises, 
reforming the said enterprises, reviewing construction 
standards, and--before anything else--establishing a genuine 
national development policy. 
  Health, the other sector to which the new head of government 
plans to give priority attention, was also discussed; the sector 
is weighed down by innumerable problems having to do with both 
human and material resources, and it undeniably suffers from 
poor management of what resources are available. 
  The prime minister's laudable initiative to deal with two 
such thorny issues as health and housing will unquestionably 
need to be followed up by monitoring in the field. The alarm has 
been sounded.

<F P=106> [Article: "Hydraulics Projects in Tissemsilt"] </F>
  [Text] Water, that rare commodity, gets a lot of attention. 
Its rational management requires investments... 
  In that context, and for the year under way, the Hydraulics 
Directorate has decided on an action plan that includes 
strengthening the potable water system (AEP) and capturing and 
mobilizing more water resources. Specifically, the plan involves 
19 projects either already launched or soon to be started, which 
among other things will increase water resource mobilization 
capacity in the locality of Ammari and bring potable water from 
the Theniet El-Had AEP to the communes of Guisba, Laayoun, 
Ferradj, and Khemisti. The latter project, which has been 
entrusted to the Hydro-Projet company, is already under way. 
  Another project in this sector involves bringing potable 
water for the locality of Lardjem from wells in Rechaiga (Tiaret 
wilaya) via Tissemsilt. This operation has finally put an end to 
the problem of potable water supply for the daira's chief town, 
which is situated about 40 km from Tissemsilt. 
  Previously, potable water was brought to the town in tank 
trucks. The system is operated by by the Tissemsilt Water 
Production and Management Enterprise. 
  However, while this project has finally brought relief to 
Lardjem, inhabitants of the daira of Bordj Bou-Naama and its 12 
attached localities must be patient, since it will be awhile 
before they enjoy a regular and adequate supply of the precious 
liquid. Water resources being sparse in this part of the wilaya, 
water use in the daira is strictly controlled under a potable 
water distribution program. 
  According to the director of hydraulics, a definitive 
solution of the problem will require building a dam with a 
storage capacity of 80 million cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]], at 
the site known as Koudiat-Frarsfa. Studies for this water 
project have been designed and carried out. 
  Under the heading of AEPs, it may be opportune to note also 
that work has begun, in the chief town of the wilaya, on a water 
tower with a storage capacity of 1,000 m[.sup]3[/]. This 
water project will increase potable water storage and 
distribution capacities in the town, which is experiencing rapid 
growth, especially on the northern outskirts. 
  On the drainage front, three large AEP projects have been 
approved, one of them adding 14 km of pipe in seven zones in the 
chief town of the wilaya. The other two projects involve 
building a 2-km concrete conduit for transporting waste water. 
  Realization of these two projects has been entrusted to 
Hydro-Technique, an Algiers-based company that specializes in 
the field and has a contract to build a small dam with a storage 
capacity of 4 million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  That's in addition to another project, the dam at Bougara, 
which has a storage capacity of 14 million m[.sup]3[/]. 
  The dam has not been exploited since going into service in 
1991. A study of irrigation possibilities has just been 
completed. Water from the Bougara dam will be devoted 
exclusively to irrigation of an agricultural perimeter, 
according to the hydraulics directorate.

  [Text] Abdelhak Bouhafs, Sonatrach [National Company for 
the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons] director general, 
has said that Algeria's gas exports will reach 60 billion cubic 
meters a year. 
  Export revenues for 1994 will be less than required for 
servicing our foreign debts, but restructuring will tangibly 
reduce the burden of the debts. 
  He said that the companies which started work, such as Mobil 
and six other companies, expressed their readiness... 
[unfinished sentence as heard] 
  Bouhafs added that oil prices have affected investment. 
  Concerning the contents of the agreement signed with the 
IMF, 
Bouhafs said that this will indirectly help Sonatrach because it 
is facing the problem of foreign debts. Nevertheless, it will 
reduce financial pressure and facilitate the acquisition of hard 
currency revenues.

<F P=106> [Article by Hasan al-Chalabi, head of Constitution Committee </F>
of Iraqi National Congress: "To Maintain or Lift Sanctions 
Against Saddam Regime? Acceptance of Current Regime's Survival 
Will Cause Iraq To Lose Its Immunity"] 
  [Text] Conflict over the fate of sanctions against Saddam's 
regime continues to rise. Sometimes it becomes confused and 
indistinct in its outlines; at other times its currents clash 
and fight each other; and this ever since the embargo was 
imposed on Saddam by international resolutions soon after the 
invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. After Kuwait was liberated, 
each of the parties involved in the embargo began acting on 
inspiration from its interests and according to the dictates of 
its own policy on the subject. This has became as clearly 
evident on the Arab scene as on the international scene. 
  Exploiting this situation, the regime began to stir 
interests 
and ambitions this way and that among its friends in the 
pressure group in the major powers. Thus, for example, one sees 
France, which had been behind Security Council Resolution 688 to 
end the regime's repression of its people, concentrating on 
measures to ease the embargo and speed its lifting and on 
measures acceptable to Saddam's regime--implementing Section 22 
of Resolution 687, for example, regarding the elimination of 
weapons of mass destruction--to justify ending the sanctions, 
regardless of other international resolutions. 
  No sooner had France done this than Russia and China joined 
her. When the fraternal neighbor Kuwait moved to ask about the 
fate of the linkage between lifting sanctions and recognition of 
her borders and sovereignty, these countries were forced to talk 
with Saddam--they were also inspired by their interests--on the 
chance that he might agree to such recognition and the problem 
might end. 
  Would that the matter had ended there, and that [another] 
fraternal neighbor had not proceeded in its own way! Suddenly 
Islamic Iran, claiming to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi 
people, opened its borders to the Baghdad regime, so that it 
could obtain the goods and materials it desired to support its 
survival and enable it to regain its strength. Thus Iran forgot, 
or pretended to forget, Iraq's savage war of aggression against 
it; it forgot, or pretended to forget, the famous condition that 
Imam Khomeyni's voice proclaimed during that war: that war 
should continue until victory was achieved with the demise of 
Saddam and his regime forever; and it forgot, or pretended to 
forget, the imam's famous words spoken when he was asked to halt 
the firing: that he would rather drink poison than agree to what 
he was being asked to do. 
  And now fraternal Jordan, that went out of its way to 
support 
Saddam and his regime despite all the aggression he had 
committed against his people and neighbors, has never flagged in 
its efforts to smuggle forbidden goods and materials to him 
under the cloak of alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people 
and reducing the losses resulting from the blockade of Aqaba. 
How one wishes that the government in Jordan would believe that 
alleviating or ending this suffering will not come by supplying 
Saddam's government with the means to survive and conquer its 
own people, but rather by depriving him of those means, so that 
they can escape his clutches and his suffocating hold on their 
necks! On that day, our brothers in Jordan will realize that the 
crushing suffering of the Iraqi people comes from the 
continuance of Saddam's government and from those who supply him 
with support and backing, and from nothing else. 
  How great were the surprise and wonder of the Iraqi people 
when they saw fraternal Qatar normalize relations with Saddam's 
regime and when one country after another restored them under 
the same cover of "alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people 
and its tragic pains"! None of us could see how exchanging 
ambassadors with Saddam's regime or the Qatari ambassador's 
return to Baghdad alleviated suffering and pain. Did brotherhood 
and neighborliness not oblige the government leaders in 
fraternal Qatar to read the reality of Iraq attentively and 
fairly and scan the record of its present government before 
making their normalization decisions and going it alone among 
their fellow Gulf countries? They ought to have determined who 
it was who had devastated Iraq and brought down on it all these 
woes--the international community or Saddam's regime. They 
should have known with clear sight how this fraternal country 
might be saved and its people rescued from their 
suffering--whether by supporting and helping the root of the 
suffering or by liberating the people from him and releasing 
them from their fetters. 
  Dealings with the Baghdad regime proceed selectively. 
Positions, measures, and arrangements are accepted or rejected 
according to how they accord with the interests of this or that 
party. As for the Iraqi people, they are absent, or rather have 
been made absent, from the stage of events. None of these 
parties wants to execute on Saddam and his aides the sentence of 
history that in times past was imposed on similar insolent 
tyrants, who received just retribution at Nuremberg and 
elsewhere. How is Saddam any different from Hitler and his 
cronies or from any of the world's great war criminals, that he 
should escape retribution and punishment to the present day? Has 
his aggression against his people entailed less than the 
aggression of those criminals? Was his aggression against a 
fraternal neighbor less hateful than what took place at their 
hands? 
  These interests and ambitions, which are besieging the 
people 
of Iraq, thus leaving them easy prey to Saddam's repression and 
tyranny, are making Iraqis focus their attention on the region 
of their country that has liberated itself from him. They are 
tying their hopes to it for salvation from his evil scourge, 
with this region as the base from which the onslaught can 
proceed against those who sit in the centers of power and 
government in Baghdad. We can therefore imagine how much 
heartache and pain there were when Iraq's brother Kurds fought 
and made war on each other in this region and how much 
apprehension and anxiety for their destiny until the fighting 
and war ceased. There was universal rejoicing in Iraq and 
elsewhere when Iraqi Kurdistan freed itself from Baghdad's rule 
and when the democratic process began there about this time two 
years ago. As we witness the cessation of mutual fighting and 
war, we can but say to our dear brethren that peace among you 
and in your dwellings is the point on which Iraqis pin their 
hopes for liberation and freedom from slavery. 
  The alliance between you and Iraq's Arabs embodied in the 
Iraqi National Congress is the life preserver from the regime 
and scourge of Saddam; for secession is not something you want, 
neither is it possible due to well-known regional and 
international objections and circumstances. Maintenance of the 
status quo for however long is nothing but a transitional, 
temporary solution. Therefore, the outcome will be either to 
remain in this alliance and strengthen it, or to return to 
Saddam's regime and leave the matter to God. It is in the 
interest of Iraq's Kurds and Arabs now to adhere to the 
federalism embodied in the government of Iraqi Kurdistan, on the 
one hand, and to the Iraqi National Congress, on the other hand, 
as a transitional, temporary central body to bring to the Iraqi 
people a government that the people elect in universal, direct, 
free, and honest elections after getting rid of Saddam's rule. 
Let us work together to strengthen the regional government and 
the central National Congress, that we may stand as a united 
Iraq in the face of Saddam's regime at home and abroad. 
  However selectively the Security Council resolutions 
concerning Saddam's regime may be handled, and however far the 
attempts may go to obscure what he did to his people and in the 
region--attempts to erase the facts of his behavior--the 
regime's aggressiveness and violations of the laws of humanity 
are so enormous and dangerous that in order to remove the regime 
it will not suffice that its arsenal of weapons of mass 
destruction be removed, or that it recognize Kuwait's 
sovereignty and borders, or that it release Kuwaiti prisoners as 
mandated by international resolutions. No, all these resolutions 
with their provisions must be carried out effectively, but 
especially the provisions of Resolution 688, which calls for 
changing the nature of the current government in Baghdad. Only 
in this way can the people escape their present predicament, 
security return to the area, and the necessary standards for 
international dealings be followed. 
  Certainly, none of this can be achieved or expected while 
Saddam with his aides and regime continues to rule. What we are 
saying and advocating is nothing new in the history of the 
world's tyrants and masters of injustice and oppression. The 
aggressiveness of Hitler and his aides, for example, caused the 
German state to be removed from the political map for about 40 
years. When Germany was restored to political existence in 1949, 
it was divided between West and East, and remained so for 40 
years, until it regained its unity and sovereignty in the fall 
of 1991. 
  What is this punishment compared to the nature of Saddam's 
regime? See how he does as he pleases in the region and rides 
roughshod over the world, as he and his mouthpieces call for 
lifting the sanctions and normalizing relations with him; and 
this at a time when just retribution ought to be imposed on him 
and those who sided with him, as having been directly 
responsible for the invasion and the fearful war crimes that 
were committed, instead of these sanctions that have not 
affected his person, his sources of power, or his means of 
oppression to any significant extent. 
  The survival and actions of the present Baghdad government 
have caused the state and people of Iraq to lose the immunity 
and esteem they had in the international community, thus 
encouraging infringement and trifling with the rights of Iraq. A 
sign of this are the recent statements by UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali about Iraqi funds that have disappeared or been 
squandered by various financial and oil companies--as if they 
were loose funds and fair game, with no one having ownership or 
title to them. The situation reminds us of what used to be 
called "the Sick Man [of Europe]"--the end of the Ottoman 
Empire, when there was competition and fighting to divide and 
plunder his possessions. It is not unlikely, after the situation 
we are witnessing of Saddam with his people and the world, that 
his shameful rule in Iraq will lead to the same consequences as 
that "sick man's" rule. 
  Now that Iraqi Kurdistan has freed itself from Saddam's 
rule, 
Iraq today lives in a state of real and effective division of 
government between the north, on the one hand, and the center 
and south, on the other. Thus there are two separate governments 
ruling Iraq, each independent of the other; indeed, each is 
fighting the other, so that one cannot expect Iraq to regain its 
unity as a people and state so long as the current government 
continues to exist in Baghdad. One is therefore led to wonder at 
those who hold that only Saddam's rule can guarantee Iraq's 
continued unity. 
  Saddam is tireless and indefatigable in challenging the 
rights of the people of Iraq, the rights of neighbors, and the 
injunctions of the legitimate international authority. Whenever 
the time approaches for the periodic Security Council review of 
the sanctions against his regime, one sees him working 
energetically to get rid of them so as to survive and remain in 
power. Thus you see him today stirring up Turkey's regional 
fears, one the one hand, and its anxieties about its revenues, 
on the other, calling on Turkey to act against the entity 
existing in northern Iraq, with its secessionist possibilities 
whose consequences could affect Turkey's unity to the core. He 
is also calling Turkey to cease being silent about the billions 
of dollars it is losing as a result of the halt to Iraqi oil 
exports through Turkey. 
  Turkey has therefore begun protesting to the United States 
and other coalition members about the continued embargo on Iraq 
and the survival of the liberated entity in the north. Indeed, 
the Turkish foreign minister, Hikmet Cetin, during his recent 
visit to New York at the end of April, was led to advocate a 
strange selectivity in applying the Security Council resolutions 
concerning Saddam's regime. He advocated lifting the embargo, on 
the ground that the regime had fulfilled all the relevant 
demands specified in Section 22 of Security Council Resolution 
687 on the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. 
Disregarding the remaining provisions of international 
resolutions, especially those of Resolution 688, dealing with 
the rights of the Iraqi people vis-a-vis their present 
government, he said: "There is no relation between the Council's 
resolutions and the government in Iraq. It is not the business 
of the United Nations or any country to decide who shall 
administer and rule Iraq." He emphasized that Turkey "did not 
approve of introducing personal aspects into the terms of the 
oil embargo." He called on Iraqi Kurds to hold talks with 
Baghdad, describing the situation in their territory as 
"unstable." 
  We do not understand how this minister could consider the 
Saddam regime's enormous violations of human rights and the laws 
of humanity in Iraq and his aggressive attack on Kuwait and 
other countries as "personal aspects." While making these 
pronouncements, should he not have remembered the positions he 
once took calling for a trial of Serbian war criminals? Is there 
any difference between what the latter did and what Saddam did? 
How can one consider what happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina war 
crimes, and what happened in Iraq and vicinity personal aspects 
and affairs? 
  How could he deny a relation between the United Nations and 
Saddam's rule when every letter of the UN Charter is at variance 
with his claim? Should he not have read the principles of this 
international charter, especially Section 2, Paragraph 7, before 
making his pronouncement under the influence of the political 
principle that calls for changing one's position whenever one's 
interests change?--but not to such a length as caused his deputy 
minister, having ascertained that the United States had released 
the Iraqi oil stored in Turkey's pipeline, to wash his hands of 
his alliance with Iraq by saying, "We were treated as if we had 
made an alliance with Iraq to violate the embargo, but this 
unnecessary attempt was the result of misunderstanding." 
  Efforts by Saddam and his regime to convince officials to 
follow a selective policy in implementing international 
resolutions concerning him were most successful with France, 
where there were friends and followers. Today we see France 
speak with pompous eloquence when Saddam's envoy Tariq 'Aziz 
arrives in New York, saying: "France urges Iraq to take a 
concrete step toward recognizing the state of Kuwait. We have 
told the Iraqis that this is the essence of the matter and that 
their taking such a step would set everything else in motion." 
  Is what France says true? Is it true that the essential 
solution to the problems of the Saddam regime and to the world's 
difficulties with him lie in his recognizing Kuwait's 
sovereignty and borders? Saddam does not object to such 
recognition if it proves sufficient to lift the sanctions from 
his regime. He knows full well that no solemn recognition can 
ever stand in the way of his realizing his ambitions, dreams, 
and vision of glory as soon as he senses that he can cross the 
Kuwaiti and other borders. The problem with him in this respect 
is not so much the promises he makes or the oaths he swears as 
the availability of forces to do one thing or another. He has 
accustomed us to what he calls "phasing" in policy and military 
affairs. What this means is that in one phase he yields 
something difficult to yield, only to take it back and even more 
in another phase. 
  The story of what he gave to Iran in Algiers in 1975 is 
well-known. Scarcely had he finished dividing sovereignty over 
the Shatt al-'Arab equally with Iran than he began plotting not 
only to regain the Shatt completely, but also to invade all of 
Iran; and so it came to pass on 22 September 1980. He did the 
same thing in his war against Iran. Scarcely had he finished 
with that war, which absorbed his and Iraq's effort and 
strength, than he began planning for his new war. At the time, 
people imagined that the man, exhausted by eight years of war, 
had no further desire for violence, aggression, and hostile 
adventures such as would cause him to embark on a new war; yet 
he attacked Kuwait on 2 August 1990. 
  Thus, recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty and even of its 
borders is not unacceptable to Saddam. All that remains before 
he grants it is the matter of arranging things to save face. 
Having bound himself and his regime with pledges and promises 
not to relinquish Iraq's right to the territory of Kuwait and to 
remain there even if it should require a hundred years of war, 
it is difficult for him to retreat from his pledges and promises 
so easily before the nations and the world. Perhaps Tariq 
'Aziz's statement to the Austrian newspaper DER STANDARD on the 
eve of his trip to New York, confirms what we have said 
previously. He said: "The Kuwait issue now is finished for the 
Iraqi government, except that we cannot prevent the Iraqi people 
from thinking as they wish; however, historical facts cannot be 
ignored." Nevertheless, Saddam's man of sound judgment and chief 
of diplomacy thinks it possible that the people will join with 
their government. They support it "because they know that it is 
working for their welfare and that of Iraq"--if it is possible 
to overcome "the frustration the Iraqi people feel from seeing 
that although their country's government has carried out all the 
UN resolutions on Kuwait, this has not helped alleviate their 
suffering, but has even increased it." 
  It would not be beside the truth or the facts for us to say 
in light of what we read in Tariq 'Aziz's statement or read in 
Saddam's actual attitude and precedents in this matter that 
Saddam and his regime are ready to implement all the Security 
Council resolutions concerning them, except one: Resolution 688, 
which calls for changing the nature of his government and giving 
the Iraqi people their say regarding it. This resolution is his 
first and last enemy, for he sees in its implementation his end 
and the collapse of his government. 
  There is therefore no way to conclude a truce with him. One 
cannot hold one's peace regarding him or regarding what such 
countries as the United States and Britain call for 
implementing. The latest example to appear of his war against 
this resolution was what we read in the writings of some of his 
propagandists. They said that America's support of the 
resolution, as enunciated in Secretary of State Christopher's 
article in THE NEW YORK TIMES, did not reflect his country's 
real policy on the matter: there was a split in American circles 
regarding policy toward Saddam's regime, and it would be only a 
matter of months and days--time to prepare everything--until the 
hour of truth would strike and things would return to their 
normal course with America and other countries. 
  We do not know whether this prophecy was made as a result of 
information possessed by its authors or whether it was a guess 
on their part. In any case, we assure them that stands on 
liberating Iraq from Saddam's regime from the direction of the 
United States are not based on the flowery words and promises 
that the Iraqi National Congress receives from time to time, 
sometimes from President Clinton and sometimes from his aides. 
Rather, these stands are based on calculations of interest that 
clearly indicate that the international community has no 
interest in the Baghdad regime's remaining in power, because 
there is need for a government that shall express the opinion 
and interests of the people, respect rights and peace in the 
region, and rebuild the world's trust in Iraq--things that 
Saddam can no longer accomplish. 
  American and British insistence on linking the lifting of 
sanctions from Saddam's regime with implementation of Resolution 
688 accords with the essential purpose for which the sanctions 
were imposed. They were not imposed only to expel his regime 
from Kuwait or to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction, as 
Saddam and his mouthpieces say; they were imposed to uproot and 
utterly eradicate aggressiveness. This gave the aforesaid 
resolution absolute priority in the invasion and liberation of 
Kuwait. Only this resolution, implemented with the required 
honesty and effectiveness, can change the nature of the current 
government in Baghdad and write a new history for it and the 
region. Only then will the measures and steps now required be 
rendered irrelevant. 
  We therefore believe that the efforts of all parties on the 
Arab, regional, and international scene interested in the 
region's peace and security must work together to insist that 
Resolution 688 have precedence over other resolutions in the 
areas of respect and implementation. This they should do by 
working to move it into the scope of the provisions of Article 7 
of the United Nations Charter. Ending sanctions against Saddam's 
regime should be made conditional on its execution and 
implementation. At the same time, an effort should be made to 
break the siege of the Iraqi people, especially in the liberated 
area, by rendering Security Council resolutions 706, 712, and 
778 effective.

  [Text] The weekly economic report from Shell's Kuwait 
office speaks of clear discrepancies between what the Minister 
of Finance and the Governor of the Central Bank have said about 
debtors who had not documented their debts. The report suggests 
that the Kuwaiti oil tanker firm's current management leaked to 
a Kuwaiti newspaper a report prepared and submitted to the 
Cabinet, dealing with past conditions at the company. It had 
been decided the Cabinet would forward it to the public 
prosecutor, but the company protested and held back from 
publishing it. The text of the report follows: 
<H5>  Hard Currency Indebtedness </H5>
  The official Kuwaiti News Agency attributed to the governor 
of the Kuwaiti Central Bank additional information about the 
level of preliminary compliance with Law 41/93, which deals with 
hard currency indebtedness. The numbers attributed to the 
governor give a picture somewhat different from those we had 
printed as of last week, which relied on what the minister of 
finance had stated immediately after the conclusion of the time 
limit for compliance with the law on 31 March 1994, [a 
discrepancy] which may be due to the delay in the checking and 
analysis of the statements. 
  The governor says that there are 10,323 agents subject to 
the 
law, with a total balance of indebtedness of 6,294 Kuwaiti 
dinars [KD]--nearly KD703 million more than the number of bonds 
issued. 
  He attributes this discrepancy to several conflicting 
processes, as the bonds were issued at a higher value to banks 
including interest on the balance of indebtedness from 1 August 
1990 until 31 December 1991, but the balance of indebtedness is 
greater than its coverage of debts, to which are added the 
allocations collected by banks from 1986 until 1 August 1990 and 
discounted from the value of the bonds, plus the balance of debt 
clearance, amounting to KD900 million. These are political and 
non-professional debts paid from the public treasury through 
some major investment companies. 
  The governor says that "debt measures have been concluded 
for 
a total of 3,651 agents (those who paid immediately); this is 
35.4 percent of the whole, with a balance of KD71 million in 
debts, 11.3 percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt 
balance per agent of about KD195,000. On the other hand, nearly 
3,503 agents have not documented their manner of debt settlement 
and violated the provisions of the law; this is 34 percent of 
the total, with a debt balance of nearly KD209 million, or 3.3 
percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt balance of 
nearly KD60,000. This shows a crucial disparity from what the 
minister of finance had said (KD900 million). This means KD3.169 
billion, or nearly 85.4 percent of total indebtedness, with an 
average debt balance of about KD1.7 million." 
  In brief, there are nearly 6,820 agents complying with the 
law, representing nearly 66 percent of total agents, with a 
balance of KD6.085 billion in debts. An over-all view, in terms 
of averages, makes it possible to say that most of the agents 
complying with the law have average debts. It is they who paid 
up immediately. The smallest number of them complying had small 
debts, benefiting most from the law. As to lack of awareness or 
special circumstances, especially the rebate of consumer loans, 
one notes that those with large indebtedness complied with the 
law when they provided documentation in the limited time. 
Undoubtedly some of them are betting on time and the chance for 
changes in the law. 
<H5>  Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Company </H5>
  One of the local newspapers has published a secret report 
that seems to have been submitted to the cabinet before the case 
was to be forwarded to the public prosecutor's office. It is 
clear that it had been prepared by the company's present 
management. The management sent the newspaper an advertisement, 
which the newspaper refrained from publishing, thereby 
confirming its truth, to some degree. We believe it is an 
unfortunate step on the part of the company, if one assumes such 
reports to be public information of which it is the right of all 
people to form a public opinion, both in terms of the extent of 
its effect, with other cases, on the past, present, and future 
of the country, or as a result of circumstances and the time in 
which they occurred. What makes this report unusual is that it 
presents the documents and computer printouts used in the 
embezzlement we mentioned last week, such as buying at higher 
than the value, domination of management decisionmaking, 
choosing the team, money laundering through paper companies, and 
secret accounts. 
  There must be verification, and action to deny the 
connection 
of two banks in which the government owns a majority share, and 
whose names appear in the report. We do not think they had any 
role in what happened. A third bank was also named, in which one 
of the two banks owned shares, and which was supported by the 
Kuwaiti Government during the period of occupation. 
  Perhaps one of the distinctions of the case is that it was 
discovered by coincidence, either through the neglect of some 
officials involved in the seizure of all the company's documents 
linked to the case, or by way of one of the bank officials 
intruding, through either curiosity or courtesy, with questions 
about the drop in the level of operations activity. Perhaps this 
is certain evidence of the failure of internal and external 
monitoring agencies, and individual authority in management, 
whether in political or administrative terms, or in terms of the 
oil sector. What the tanker company officials failed to do in 
destroying the bonds, the officials of the Kuwait Investment 
Office in London succeeded in doing, as did the management of 
the Torras Group in Spain. 
  Despite all the evidence recorded in the report, which 
cannot 
except any of the accused, the consitutional court is now 
looking into the competence of the ordinary courts to try one of 
the ministers due to the ordinance of a law the Cabinet adopted 
in 1990. 
  In terms of political immunity, and in light of what has 
come 
before, and apart from the verdict of the constitutional court, 
one would assume that the government will take the initiative to 
do everything in its power to pursue trying the officials, and 
the other authorities will do their utmost to achieve this goal.

<F P=106> [Interview with `Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by </F>
Salah-al-Din al-Jarushi in Beirut; time not given--first two 
paragraphs are AL-MAJALLAH introduction] 
  [Text] He was calm, and gave answers readily, giving you 
the feeling from the first moment that his bulk is bigger than 
Lebanon. He reminds you of the kind of man that scorns his own 
life to mobilize others. The young men around him are bound to 
him by emotional ties, and seize with a great deal of 
admiration, awe, and unquestioning approval upon the words that 
flow from him. Many political forces see him as an intelligent 
and international figure, and a major variable on the Lebanese 
scene. 
  He is `Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, a figure who 
raises 
many questions. We started our interview with him by talking 
politics, and quickly moved on to political thought, which is 
one perspective of the Arab Islamic movement. We tried to 
provoke him, to differentiate between tactics and strategy, 
between what is fixed and what is changeable. He concluded by 
saying that the originator of a thought cannot abandon his 
strategy. His point of view is respected, even though the 
history of philosophy and politics offers innumerable examples 
to the contrary. 
  [Al-Jarushi] Don't you think the outcome of the 
Palestinian-Israeli talks, and the expected outcome of the 
multiparty talks, will mean the end of an era, and move the 
whole region into a new era necessitating a change in cultural 
and political discourse, as well as in methods of action? 
  [Fadlallah] I imagine that in this region, as in any other 
region, there are two lines, the official line and the popular 
line. It is natural for action to occur at a distance from the 
Arab world so as not to affect the political situation 
seriously; thus we have this attempt to substitute the Middle 
East address. Official political discourse did not wait for the 
end of the negotiations to change. It started the process of 
change, with some differences in vocabulary. The current 
atmosphere is one of acceptance of Israel as a natural state in 
the region. We may read in some Arab rhetoric that Israel is the 
country whose friendship all or most people are seeking to 
obtain, and this rhetoric will change even more with the policy 
of the status quo. 
  And yet popular discourse is still experiencing many 
complications in this regard. We do not see any Arab or Islamic 
circumstances that accept Israel's existence in terms of 
people's emotions, of any feeling of comfort or reassurance. I 
believe that popular Arab reality, in its inner Islamic 
vocabulary, still rejects peace with Israel. This is aside from 
methods of political pressure being applied to them in this 
regard. 
  For this reason, I imagine that the coming phase will not 
have the capabilities enabling it to maintain the atmosphere of 
peace. We must watch the future; Israel, which is trying to 
penetrate the region economically, and the workings of security 
to focus its existence regionally, is at the same time trying to 
hamper economics and security with its anticipated intervention 
in inter-Arab disputes. Perhaps what Egyptian reports have 
revealed, about Israeli machinations behind some of the 
explosions, are a sign of what I mentioned. For Israel, from 
this aspect, has restored Arab rejection of the Jewish question 
and the Israeli reality from within Arab reality, instead of 
from outside it as used to be the case. 
  I do not think the new phase will be a stable one at the 
popular level, and many names will disappear after the 
American-planned "peace" to renew the region in line with the 
new policy based on protecting Washington's interests and 
providing an atmosphere of what they call freedom here and 
there, which will bring convulsions here and there. 
<H5>  Resistance and Options </H5>
  [Al-Jarushi] If we apply your argument to the situation in 
Lebanon, don't you think an Israeli-Syrian-Lebanese peace would 
result in the de-clawing of Hizballah and put an end to any 
military activity in the south? That would force everyone to 
fall into line. 
  [Fadlallah] It is natural that the matter of peace--should 
it 
succeed--could create great complications for the resistance, 
but we do not think it will eliminate it. I think the resistance 
has other options, which we are not discussing. It would be 
obvious to say that Lebanon's political situation after peace 
will be different from what it is before peace. But Lebanon 
remains the land of freedom in the region. It is the country 
which I want to be, in the global balance, the lung through 
which the region's problems breathe, reducing its congestion, 
and for this reason it will retain the dissident political 
discourse which international spy agencies will explore to find 
the inclinations of the rejectionist movements. We always used 
to say that the intellectual and political freedoms in Lebanon 
were not for the benefit of the Lebanese themselves, but for the 
benefit of the international spy agencies that are in the pay of 
various proponents of the Arab and Islamic status quo on the 
Lebanese scene. 
  [Al-Jarushi] Let's move on from politics to strategic 
thinking. The Islamic movement began as a cultural, 
civilizational undertaking, then turned into movements and 
parties working to establish an Islamic state, then slipped into 
defending closed parties and groups. Some of the action of these 
groups ended in violence and counter-violence. Don't you feel, 
for your part, that the the Islamic movement is experiencing a 
severe crisis? 
  [Fadlallah] I don't want to address this topic with the 
expression "a severe crisis in the Islamic movement." I want to 
be objective in studying the reality of the Islamic movement, 
without all the exaggerations of politics and the media. 
  The Islamic movement is basically, in the concept of 
Islamists, the belief that Islam is the foundation of 
philosophy, compassion, and life; that it represents a form of 
governance, and people may debate this proposition. We can say 
that Islam has lived as a question of governance for its entire 
history up until the 20th century. If we were to discuss the 
Abbasid, Umayyad, or Ottoman caliphates, the details of the 
nature of government would be discussed in exactly the same way 
as a democratic or a socialist government. What is certain is 
that Islam, from the prophetic era up until the fall of the 
Caliphate, never existed without a state. The state was, 
basically, the historical depth of Islam. The Islamists are not 
inventing something new when they bring up the idea of a state. 
The acceptance of party organization is the modern means for 
achieving a state from the political point of view, and in the 
framework of the democratic game, without regard to their view 
of democracy. Thus the thought is hardly an innovation to 
people. The question "Why a state?" is not asked of Islamists. 
We ask the others in charge of governance, "Why a state?" Why is 
there a Marxist party, or a nationalist party? Why shouldn't 
there be an acknowledged Islamic party? 
  The Islamists are working towards integration with political 
reality; not all of them perhaps, but I know of more than one 
Islamic movement trying to open up to political reality. But 
there is a will to eliminate political Islam. We maintain that 
Islamic violence is a reaction to other violence. If freedom 
were given, no Muslim would so much as carry a stick to fight 
anyone else. So try democracy in the Arab world, and you will 
find the peace you seek. The Islamists are not leading a 
terrorist movement, but a defensive one. Whoever calls for 
regimes to enter into dialogue with the Islamists and others 
with an open mind and open heart will find only acceptance on 
the part of the Islamists. 
  We are not comfortable with the shocks our Muslim lands are 
experiencing. It is in no one's interest, no one's but that of 
international spy agencies. All there is to it is that things 
have not been handled correctly; fix that, and you will see that 
reason will prevail. 
<H5>  A Heap of Errors </H5>
  [Al-Jarushi] Don't you feel that in your rhetoric there is a 
whitewashing of the Islamic movements, as if they weren't 
experiencing fundamental problems? Take Algeria for example. The 
present regime wants to open a dialogue, but the Islamists are 
setting unfair conditions for accepting the principle of 
dialogue. 
  [Fadlallah] I am not absolving the Islamic movement of 
errors. I am one of those who has gone on the record, in a loud 
voice, with more than one remark and question mark, in many 
places of the Islamic movement, including Lebanon and Iran. But 
I was speaking of the public line. I know there are some small 
movements that think violence shortens the whole movement to 
attain its goals. We do not think violence is the basis, but I 
allege that there is a blockade of the Islamic movement. 
  You mentioned Algeria. I have no detailed information on the 
position of the new government, but we know the Islamists there 
embraced the democratic experiment and won, and there was no 
fraud. They question is, why were the elections nullified? Why 
was the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] banned? This means there 
is a will to nullify the will of the Algerian people, or, more 
precisely, a majority of it. 
  As to dialogue, it is the right of the Islamists, who have 
been stabbed in the back more than once, to take action to 
protect themselves and to get the details about the nature of 
this dialogue--is it merely a formal token, or a serious 
dialogue? Will it create a problem in FIS's ranks? I do not have 
precise information about the nature of the offer they were 
made, or their reasons for turning it down, particularly because 
at the time the offer was made, the government's iron fist 
policy clearly grew more severe. 
  I am not one of those who absolves the Islamic movement of 
errors. They are living in a heap of errors, but they are not 
the only ones making mistakes. We must study the circumstances 
of these errors. Are they voluntary, or the result of objective 
circumstances? 
<H5>  For Dialogue in Algeria </H5>
  [Al-Jarushi] With the importance of the details, there is a 
general line that, yes, the elections were annulled in Algeria, 
and it is an unacceptable position, but is the response to that 
to spark a civil war, kidnap and kill foreigners, and 
assassinate intellectuals and journalists? 
  [Fadlallah] Actually, I have reservations about much of the 
information provided these days. The official information is not 
unbiased. Nor do I imagine that it was the Islamists who started 
the violence. When the war machine went into action--and we have 
experienced the same thing in Lebanon--it went crazy. We 
absolutely cannot condone any group of intellectuals being 
confronted, even should we disagree with them, especially media 
people, artists, or whomever. 
  But the question is that you, as an intellectual or media 
person or artist, might some way or another enter into this 
whirlpool unintentionally. We know that some names, such as 
Kasdi Merbah, and others, have come up, and there are other 
voices accusing the regime of assassinating them. That may not 
be an accurate judgement, but when you feel there is a plan to 
distort the enemy, you become more careful. 
  We are for dialogue in Algeria, and in every other country, 
but it is only natural for any side to think about the basis 
upon which that dialogue would rest. It is your right to know 
how to enter the field, to ensure for yourself the solidity of 
the ground on which you are standing. 
  [Al-Jarushi] Excuse me, with your keenness for objectivity, 
but I have begun to fear justifying rhetoric which could open 
dangerous dead-ends to youth. The issue of violence in Algeria 
goes beyond the limited individual problem. It has become a 
process destructive to Algerian society. 
  [Fadlallah] We do sense that. I am not in a position to 
justify young men running off in that direction, but I have the 
occasion for objective study that attempts to judge one aspect, 
through the biased media. This is why I have raised questions, 
but not made judgements. 
  I recommend the study of the Algeria problem, because it 
will 
not stay confined to Algeria. There are problems on the way for 
more than one country in the region. What is needed is to create 
a condition of convulsion that can foil many global ambitions. 
My understanding of the issue in Algeria, apart from the persons 
who are taking action there, leads me to believe that this 
country is experiencing a French-American struggle. What the 
Americans want is to eliminate French influence from Arab and 
non-Arab Africa. And so, if you want to get to the bottom of the 
problem in Algeria, don't think of FIS or Ait Ahmed or Ben Bella 
or Nahnah, or even the Algerian regime itself, think of global 
interests, and the American-French struggle on Algerian soil. 
This matter may not seem as clear as possible at the present 
time, but the near future will disclose the outcome of this 
process. 
  I am speaking in the context of our experience in Lebanon, 
which is still taking its course as part of an American plan to 
expel the Palestinians politically, economically, and 
culturally. The terms of the Lebanon question are still in this 
area. 
  The present plan is to create a state of madness in most of 
the countries of the Third World, so that the madness will act 
to destroy all values, and the people will lose their 
self-confidence. This was the case in Liberia and Zaire, and it 
happened in Lebanon, and now it is happening in Algeria. God 
help other countries. 
  Algeria's problem is that it has oil, even if it is not that 
much; the thing is to extend their control over all the world's 
oil, so that America can prevent Europe and Japan from waging 
economic war on the American economy. 
<H5>  Circumstances Are Responsible </H5>
  [Al-Jarushi] I want to go back to the issue of a state, 
because I see it as the major difficulty at this time. Now, 
after the Iranian experiment, which had great luster at the 
outset, then turned rather ordinary, then the Sudanese 
experiment, we are now experiencing the tragedy of Afghanistan. 
Don't you think the expression "the Islamic state," without a 
profound theory behind it, has become a virtual trap for 
Islamists? 
  [Fadlallah] We must understand the facts, which are that 
when 
we think of an Islamic state, or a national or democratic state, 
that does not mean it will come into being with a magic wand. A 
firm infrastructure is needed. We note, for example, that Iran, 
when setting out to build an Islamic state, had to contend with 
a crazy war for eight years that damaged the whole economic 
infrastructure. The result was that Iran emerged from the war 
without any economic power, which made the state take action to 
rebuild instead of speaking of details of a media plan. I do not 
think Iran is unique in that regard. 
  We know that democratic countries are unable to find a 
solution to the economic problem--does that mean democracy is a 
mistake, or that circumstances did not help the enterprise to 
succeed? Then we come to Sudan, whose experiment is still 
fragile, and is still undergoing an insane and destructive war 
it inherited from all the regimes that preceded it. Thus we do 
not consider the Iranian and Sudanese experiences to be the 
Islamic ideal, nor do we think the extent of their experiences 
represents the extent attainable by any country--even a 
non-Muslim country--by focusing their plans on their 
circumstances. Judging them would be wrong and unfair. I say 
there is no objective study of the Iranian experiment. In 
comparison, have other countries in the Arab world succeeded in 
economic development? 
  [Al-Jarushi] They have not succeeded, and thus there has 
been 
a great deal of talk for years about the failure of the regional 
or national state. 
  [Fadlallah] We are not saying that the state has failed, 
because there are domestic and foreign circumstances that have 
forbidden or prevented the achievement of their goals. The line 
has not failed, but circumstances have been an impediment. We 
live in a complex world, from the economic, political, and 
security standpoints--any movement, including democracy, has a 
hard time succeeding. 
<H5>  Tactical Retreat </H5>
  [Al-Jarushi] The communists maintained their links to Moscow 
for more than 60 years, and they are looking for excuses for 
socialist experiments. They did not exert the effort necessary 
to criticize these experiments or work on their evolution until 
the structure collapsed and the whole thing came apart. 
  [Fadlallah] We work daily to criticize the Islamic 
experiment, and loudly. Islamists are not like communists, 
because they have no cult of personality. Plus, I believe that 
the government the Soviet Union had was neither communist nor 
socialist. 
  [Al-Jarushi] What are some of your criticisms of the Iranian 
experiment? 
  [Fadlallah] I don't recall that many, but I have criticisms 
related to political lines, and I have debated some of the 
slogans they use domestically. 
  [Al-Jarushi] If we take the political areas, we notice that 
the connection of the three experiments we have discussed 
previously to individual and collective freedoms, and basic 
human rights, stirs up many reservations and fears. 
  [Fadlallah] I imagine human rights in Iran are more advanced 
than in most countries of the Arab world and the Third World 
(?!). When you criticize Iran now you must begin with its 
newspapers. Iranian newspapers now criticize all the power 
bases, and the Friday preachers, who are supported by the 
government, criticize the government in their sermons. 
  There are freedoms, but there is no room for a communist 
party, because they consider it to be a party that contradicts 
the basis of the state. Even so, I say that there is political 
and media freedom not exercised by individuals in an absolute 
fashion. There might be defects, and the security agency may 
engage in--as it is in all countries of the world--some wrongful 
practices, but human rights are not as bad as the Western media 
say. 
  [Al-Jarushi] Your call for a humanitarian state before an 
Islamic state--does it apply only to Lebanon? 
  [Fadlallah] This is no abandonment of the Islamic state, but 
I said if it is not possible to establish an Islamic state in 
Lebanon--and I believe that in the foreseeable future there is 
no likelihood of establishing an Islamic state, because of 
sectarian and international complications--we must establish a 
humanitarian state for each of us to promote his ideas in a wide 
arena undivided by sectarian boundaries. This is not an 
abandonment of the idea; it is a movement to create an 
atmosphere in which ideas may flourish, without psychological 
and political complications. 
  [Al-Jarushi] Is it a tactical or strategic retreat? 
  [Fadlallah] It may be said that it is a tactical retreat. 
The 
originator of a thought cannot abandon his strategy.

<F P=106> [Article by Muhammad Jamal 'Attabi: "Study Concerning </F>
Expansion of Power Stations in Mecca and Medina"] 
  [Text] Engineer 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Zamil, the Saudi minister 
of industry and electricity, told AL-HAYAH that he is currently 
conducting a study concerning expansion of the two power 
stations in Mecca and Medina which will cost 600 million riyals 
[SR] ($160 million). 
  He added that the total amount spent by the United Saudi 
Electricity Company in the Western Region on electricity for the 
holy pilgrimage shrines in Mecca, in order to add new stations 
and to reinforce and expand new services for subscribers and 
pilgrims going to the Holy Mosque in Mecca, has been more than 
SR400 million ($106.6 million). 
  After making an inspection tour yesterday of the holy 
pilgrimage shrines in Muna, 'Arafat, and al-Muzdalifah and 
familiarizing himself with the electrical services provided by 
the Western Region and its preparations for the pilgrimage 
season, al-Zamil demanded that, in return for these generous 
expenditures, citizens should make a constant effort to conserve 
electricity. He said that preparations for the pilgrimage season 
are being completed and are being done by a [single] unified 
office in Muna. In less than 10 hours, orders are received and 
processed concerning tents and services for pilgrims, and 
maintenance teams always stand by ready to help. 
  Concerning the inauguration of the new Ajyad electric 
transformer station in Mecca yesterday (Tuesday), al-Zamil said 
that it constitutes basic support for the holy pilgrimage 
shrines as well as reinforcement for the region's sources of 
electric power for providing electric services. 
  Prince Majid Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the province of 
Mecca, yesterday inaugurated the Ajyad station in Mecca, which 
was completed at the beginning of this month, and those 
attending included Minister al-Zamil, Engineer Mahmud Tibah, 
head of the administrative council of the electricity authority 
of the Western Region, Dr. Bakr Hamzah Khushaym, director 
general of electricity for the Western Region, and Dr. Rabi' 
Sadiq Dahlan, deputy governor of the province of Mecca. 
  It should be mentioned that the United Saudi Electricity 
Company in the Western Region put up the Ajyad transformer 
station at a total cost of SR157 million ($21.8 million), and 
implementation of the project took 15 months. This was in 
addition to implementation of the project dealing with 
construction of the al-Shubaykah transformer station, which has 
the purpose of providing a principal source of power for the 
area including the Holy Mosque in Mecca, which has a heavy 
demand for electricity. The cost of this project was SR118 
million ($31.4 million), and it was completed in 18 months. 
Furthermore, the company implemented the project for expansion 
of the Muna transformer station at a cost of SR18 million, the 
project involving laying out the electrical cable between the 
Holy Mosque transformer station and al-Misfalah [name as 
transliterated] at a total cost of about 54 million riyals, and 
the project involving straightening out the path of the 
above-ground electricity line from the Jabal al-Nur transformer 
station to the 'Arafat transformer station at a cost of SR6 
million, the implementation of which took six months. 
  Right now the Umm al-Qura University transformer station is 
being put up, at a total cost of SR118 million, and work on this 
project will come to an end at the beginning of next year.

<F P=106> [Interview With al-Sadiq al-Mahdi, Leader of Sudan's </F>
al-Ummah Party, by Muhammad Sa'id Muhammad al-Hasan, in 
Khartoum; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Khartoum--[Passage omitted] 
<H5>  What About the Interrogation? </H5>
  [Al-Hasan] When the guests departed, we asked when and why 
Sadiq al-Mahdi was summoned [by the security agency]? 
  [Al-Mahdi] Three weeks after the holiday sermon in the third 
week of last Shawwal (March), an officer came to me and said 
that they wanted me at the Security Agency premises in Khartoum 
at 1100 on Tuesday, 29 March. 
  I went there and stayed with them from 1100 until 0700 the 
next morning. Four different security teams interrogated me. The 
conversation focused on articles written, statements made, 
interviews published, and the holiday sermon. 
  They had no specific purpose, no charge and no particular 
thing to which to refer. I concluded that they wanted to express 
their resentment. I was released the next morning, and I went 
home. But I was summoned again, unexpectedly. 
  (Al-Mahdi added:) The second time, I was summoned to the 
Security Agency premises on a Thursday morning in the same month 
and at the same time, and I stayed there until 1900. I was 
interrogated by two teams. Finally, two teams of security 
officers said to me: We think that you have committed violations 
in your activities and we consider these violations detrimental 
to security. Because there are security violations, we are 
interrogating you. 
  I told them that I concluded from the nature of the 
questions 
that "your purpose is to exhaust and offend me. But if there are 
violations; if you plan to take steps and deal with us as a 
security figure, whereas we are in fact a political figure to 
you; and as long as there is no basis for legitimacy in the 
country, we will continue to demand this basis, namely the 
restoration of legitimacy. As long as you fail to respond and as 
long as legitimacy is imposed unilaterally, there will continue 
to be a conflict between us and you. The answer is to seek an 
acceptable solution for legitimacy so the conflict will be 
governed by this legitimacy. In the absence of legitimacy, the 
basis of legitimacy will continue to be envisioned subjectively 
and from a partisan perspective. We will continue to demand 
legitimacy, regardless of what steps will be taken. We must be 
dealt with as a political figure, not a security figure." 
<H5>  Strange Incidents </H5>
  [Al-Hasan] What about the recent political conditions? 
  [Al-Mahdi] The most outstanding manifestation in the recent 
period is the emergence of some sort of solidarity among all 
Islamic forces in Sudan, which have defined their position 
toward the regime. This reflects a new and clear phenomenon. The 
second point is the emergence of an almost united position among 
the southern political forces on the demand for 
self-determination. This, too, is a new phenomenon. 
  It is my opinion that there is a recurrence of interestingly 
strange incidents in Sudan, such as fires in banks, including 
the Khartoum Bank and the Bank of Sudan. There has also been an 
armed attack on a mosque in Omdurman and there have been armed 
robberies in the capital in broad daylight. 
  These phenomena or strange incidents recur every two or 
three 
weeks, and with increasing severity. They are truly strange 
phenomena, and they all fall within the context of violation of 
the laws and of public order. 
<H5>  Splits Within the Regime </H5>
  (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) There are evident splits within 
the regime, and they are documented and discussed. It hasn't 
been customary, not even within the bounds of democracy, for 
conflicts and mutual accusations to reach this degree. For 
example, Ibrahim Idam, a former Revolution Command Council 
member and the minister of communication, condemns the 
privatization of telecommunications and makes the charge that 
this would be a betrayal of trust and a waste of public money. 
  Professor Ma'mun Hamidah, a former president of Khartoum 
University, condemns the higher education phenomenon explicitly; 
calls the new universities "slogans;" and accuses the regime of 
abandoning the resolutions adopted by the higher education 
conference and of deviating fundamentally from the educational 
policies. 
  'Abd-al-Rahim Hamdi, a former finance minister, has issued a 
statement denouncing the new fiscal policies and saying that 
they are in conflict with the three-year program. He has also 
said that he resigned because of deviation from the three-year 
program policies. 
<H5>  AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI </H5>
  Then there is AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI, a paper that has come to 
crown this domestic situation with an endeavor to provide a 
critical podium. It is true that some people believe that this 
idea has been concocted by the regime and that it is a maneuver 
on the regime's part. I personally don't believe so. Mahjub 
'Urwah is from the Front (meaning the National Islamic Front). 
But he has a different opinion. 'Urwah believes that the Front 
has burned its bridges with the political forces and that these 
bridges must be rebuilt. The proof of this is that he invited me 
two years ago to talk to me about an issue that could be 
discussed by Sudan's intellectual political forces under the 
title of a "vision of the future under the canopy of the new 
world order." 
  Shaykh Rached Ghannouchi, [Tunisia's] al-Nahdah Movement 
chairman, then visited me in my house, accompanied by a young 
al-Nahdah member called Omar Hamed. We embarked on a dialogue 
about the tendencies of the current regime in Sudan. It was my 
opinion that this regime is a foe of Islam. Shaykh Ghannouchi's 
opinion was that, regardless of its faults, the regime is 
correctable. At that meeting, Hamed mentioned that there was in 
the Islamic Front a tendency stressing that the Front had to 
overcome its isolation by establishing bridges with the other 
political forces. He cited Mahjub 'Urwah as an example. 
  In my opinion, all this shows that Mahjub 'Urwah has been 
trying to establish some sort of dialogue with the opposing 
opinion. It has been evident to me that he has been trying to 
establish an independent newspaper, believing that this would 
serve the interest of the Sudanese regime and that it would 
improve this regime's image in the eyes of the world. It has 
been 'Urwah's opinion that this should be done by establishing a 
degree of freedom of the press. Therefore, the policies 
expressed by AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI have been totally logical. 
  (Al-Sadiq al-Mahdi added:) This is why I don't see that the 
paper is biased. It believes that others have erred and it wants 
to help, or help them. It is sufficient to say that in two 
months, AL-SUDAN AL-DUWALI has, want it or not, been able to do 
the following: 
  1. Document the corruption existing at present, and from 
inside sources. 
  2. Form a public opinion that wants an opposing opinion. 
  3. It has, in contrast, exposed the failure of the official 
media in a way that has annoyed this media greatly. It is my 
opinion that the steps taken against 'Urwah actually reflect the 
regime's resentment of these facts. 
  Al-Mahdi went on to add in his interview with AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT: It has become impossible to lie about the extremely 
evident phenomenon of economic failure. Prices of food supplies 
have gone out of control, and so has the dollar price. The 
negative impact of the taxes and of the harsh means employed to 
collect them has surfaced. People have turned in their licenses 
so they will not be pursued by taxes. 
  This phenomenon of turning in licenses reflects economic 
deterioration. But on the other hand, it has made people who are 
actively engaged in illicit economic activity proceed to embark 
on all kinds of illegal commercial enterprises. Smuggling has 
increased. The regime has focused on violations connected with 
its security. But it has been surprised to find itself 
unprepared for the violations that come from these parties.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al'Aziz al-Dali, envoy of Yemeni vice </F>
president, in Cairo; date not given--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ 
introduction] 
  [Text] Former Yemeni Prime Minister Mr. 'Abdallah al-Asnaj 
has said that what is happening in Yemen is the cause of intense 
unease, sorrow, and misery, and that it was hard for anyone to 
find a justification for fighting between two armies belonging 
to a single family; no official of the Yemeni Government had the 
right to push things this far. It was, he said, the duty of 
every rational person and every official in Yemen to stop this 
war: "We call for urgent Arab intervention, and for redoubled 
efforts to stop this war and this bloodshed." Al-Asnaj asserted, 
in a statement to AL-SHARQ, that "the union is not the private 
property of any one person; it is the expression of the 
steadfast wish of the Yemeni people." He explained that the 
continued present military confrontations would make it possible 
to say that the union was drowning in blood. On another front, 
AL-SHARQ met with Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the envoy of Yemeni 
Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, secretary general of the 
[Yemeni] Socialist Party and member of the party's politburo. 
Al-Dali discussed the current situation in Yemen as follows: 
  [Husayn] Is the Socialist Party ready for a unilateral halt 
to the fighting? 
  [Al-Dali] We are ready, but this will not happen as long as 
the other side continues to fight. In principle, we are ready to 
stop fighting. 
  [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the deployment of Arab 
forces? 
  [Al-Dali] If circumstances demand it, and there is no other 
way to stop the fighting but that solution, then we would not 
oppose it, if all other paths are closed to us. The other 
parties that were mediating have suggested the need to meet, in 
the framework of safeguarding Yemeni unity and implementing the 
document. 
  [Husayn] Are you prepared to accept the holding of a meeting 
in any Arab country that offers to host it? 
  [Al-Dali] Yes, we accept that. Inevitably, first of all, the 
basis for this meeting must be the necessity of a halt to the 
fighting, first of all, and studying all ways of implementing 
the pledge and agreement document. It would be mistaken to say 
that this is an internal matter. If it were an internal matter, 
why wouldn't we agree to solve the problem? Since we have failed 
to solve this problem and have resorted to bearing arms, and to 
fighting, this means that the situation is no longer an internal 
one; I believe that the situation has become dangerous and 
complicated, and now concerns every Arab nation. 
  [Husayn] What is the real way out for solving the crisis and 
stopping the bloodshed? 
  [Al-Dali] We think we are enduring the caesarian birth of a 
new situation in Yemen, and when we ask for a halt to the 
fighting, we want to ease the pain of this caesarian birth. We 
insist on a halt to the fighting, not because we feel defeat, or 
are running away from the outcome, but to spare the blood of the 
youth of Yemen who are fighting there.

<F P=106> [Interview with Speaker of House of Representatives Shaykh </F>
'Abdallah al-Ahmar, by Fawzi al-Jundi via telephone from Cairo; 
date not given--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction] 
  [Text] Despite the difficulty of getting through to the 
Yemeni capital, Sanaa, and despite the increasing noise of 
bullets and absence of the sound of dialogue between Yemeni 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, AL-SHARQ succeeded in conducting a very brief telephone 
interview with Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni 
House of Representatives and grand shaykh of the Yemeni tribes. 
The interview lasted just minutes when the telephone line went 
dead. 
  [Al-Jundi] The current situation in Yemen--who exactly is 
responsible for this military conflict? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The situation in Yemen is terrible. The 
leadership 
of the Socialist Party is responsible. They created the 
political crisis and started the military confrontation. 
  [Al-Jundi] Are you, as the leader of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping, able to carry out mediation now between the Yemeni 
president and vice president? 
  [Al-Ahmar] At the start of the crisis we tried very hard to 
play this role, and did play it, but the Socialist Party is 
being difficult, and created the crisis from the beginning. It 
had two demands: constitutional amendments and the election of a 
new presidential council. When these were granted, the party 
went on to make new demands, and we acceded out of our desire 
for unity, and all Yemeni forces tried to meet the demands that 
were made. All the demands included the pledge and agreement 
document, and we agreed to them in order to end the crisis and 
preserve the union. But after all the Yemeni forces, the 
coalition parties, and our legitimate institutions agreed to the 
document that had been signed, which granted all their demands, 
they revolted again and escalated the military situation, and 
attacked, in order to get what they really wanted: secession. 
  [Al-Jundi] It is clear that you blame the Socialist Party 
for 
what is happening now. 
  [Al-Ahmar] Yes. Yes, we blame them for what has happened. 
First, we blame them for creating the political crisis, and now 
we blame them for starting the military confrontation. We, the 
House of Representatives, have tried and are still trying to 
solve the crisis. 
  We postponed some of the constitutional measures we had the 
right to take in order to spare the country and please these 
"mutinous" elements revolting against the legitimate government, 
and heading for military conflict and the escalation of the 
situation. Thus they bear the responsibility, and the entire 
people holds them responsible. 
  [Al-Jundi] Is it possible to say that the dialogue committee 
has been playing its role in this current phase? 
  [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee has carried out its duty 
to 
formulate the document and the coalition's agreement upon it. 
Everyone agrees that the crisis ended with the signature of the 
document, but the Socialist Party revolted as it had revolted at 
the outset against democracy--only now it was revolting against 
the document. 
  [Al-Jundi] Al-Bid lays the blame on President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and his speech on 27 April. 
  [Al-Ahmar] The practical facts disprove that. President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih agreed to the document, signed it, and committed 
himself to it, and so did the others, the [General People's] 
Congress and Reform [parties]. The Socialist Party did not, 
especially Presidential Council Member 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salim 
Salih Muhammad, the Prime Minister, and the Socialist ministers. 
It has been two and one-half months since it was signed, and 
everyone is in agreement. 
  The Socialist Party started the military confrontation to 
get 
what it wanted--secession. That is why we hold them responsible. 
  [Al-Jundi] Are you able to play a role at present? 
  [Al-Ahmar] There are no solutions beyond what is there in 
the 
document. If there is any role I can play as leader of the 
Yemeni Grouping, I will not hesitate. 
  It was at this point that the phone went dead.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member </F>
of the Presidential Council, by Qatari News Agency, via 
telephone from Doha; date not given] 
  [Text] His Eminence Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, member 
of the Presidential Council in the Republic of Yemen, has blamed 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] for the outbreak of the current 
fighting. He explained that the government had done everything 
in its power to prevent the present clash, and even offered 
"major concessions." The YSP, however, proceeded to escalate to 
crisis, until it has reached the point where it is today. Shaykh 
'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani revealed, in a telephone interview with 
the Qatar News Agency, that the pro-secession forces in the 
South were receiving outside aid. He expressed his doubt, 
however, that the secessionists would be able to take advantage 
of this assistance. In his interview, al-Zandani criticized some 
of the Arab media for the way they were covering the events in 
Yemen, and called upon them to check their accuracy in the 
treatment of these events. He also called for a clear and strong 
Arab position that supported "truth and constitutional 
legitimacy." In this connection, the Presidential Council member 
lauded Qatar's position on the Yemen crisis, saying that "our 
brothers in Qatar have stood with us in our predicament, and 
stood with truth, unity, and legitimacy." Shaykh al-Zandani said 
in the interview that the forces of legitimacy and unity were in 
a secure position, and that they were now very close to Aden. He 
categorically denied the rumors about the presence of other Arab 
forces fighting alongside them. 
  Responding to a question about the background of the events, 
Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani said in his Qatar News Agency 
interview that the Socialist Party that had ruled the southern 
part of Yemen for 23 years, and that the communist regime had 
used the union as a cover, after the fall of the communist 
parties of other countries of the world, though they still were 
working for secession, and retained their hegemony over the 
southern and eastern governorates. They had, he said, spent the 
funds allocated to them, and budgets, for services benefiting 
their party, and never cared about the union. 
  He added that the Socialist Party had never changed its 
agenda, even now, and still acted in line with the philosophy of 
struggle and the existence of contradiction, which it fed in 
creating the crisis. Furthermore, it still had a factory making 
alcoholic beverages, and encouraged sectarian, tribal, and party 
conflicts. 
  He went on to say, "Then this party began to mortgage its 
policy to foreign interests and lost its appetite for the unity 
of Yemen, people, land, and government. So the crisis flared 
up." He said that the instigator of the crisis was 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who started it after his return from America on last 19 
August, while the House of Representatives had put its trust in 
the coalition government on the third of that month. 
  He added that 'Ali Salim al-Bid had begun to escalate the 
crisis after his "seclusion in Aden." He made life hard for 
people, until the crisis reached the point of military 
engagements. He said that the government had offered concessions 
that deserved consideration in order to avert collapse, but in 
spite of them the explosion took place in Abyan on the day the 
"Pledge and Accord Document" was signed. 
  In his interview, His Excellency Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zandani enumerated many facts as evidence that it was the 
Socialist Party that had started the trouble and brought things 
to where they were now. He said that the Socialists were behind 
the fighting that took place in Shabwah, 'Umran, and Dhamar, 
between units of the armed forces. He said that the government 
had done everything in its power to contain these events, and 
keep their scope as narrow as possible, but the Socialist Party 
was engaged in plans to stir up and escalate the fighting in 
several regions, and this forced the government to take steps to 
protect its army and people, and to protect the union and the 
legitimate government. 
  The president of the Yemeni Presidential Council indicated, 
however, in his answer to a question, that there was a large 
anti-secession group in the Socialist Party, which opposed the 
party's plans, and its voice was now being heard against the 
leadership. He said, "We wanted the Socialist Party to change 
its ideological and political conduct, to bury the past, and to 
resume a good life, but it utterly rejected this opportunity." 
  In response to a question about whether it would be possible 
for the government to deal with the Socialist Party in the event 
the party's leadership changed, he said, "The government has 
laid down conditions for that, the first of which is that we 
cannot put down our arms unless the rebels submit to the 
legitimate government and the results of the April 1993 
elections. And they must turn over war criminals for trial." As 
to whether the present war might turn into a civil war, Shaykh 
al-Zandani expressed his confidence that the Yemeni people in 
the South were even more dedicated than the people of the 
Northern governorates when it came to getting rid of the 
Socialist Party, because they had tasted the bitterness of that 
party's rule for 23 years. 
  He added, "Many of those who are fighting the Socialist 
Party 
are from the southeastern governorates. As soon as they were 
assured that they would be protected from the Socialist Party 
and its maltreatment of them, and once they had the opportunity, 
they proclaim their true opinions of this party. 
  Addressing the Socialists' position in the House of 
Representatives now that events had run out of control, 
al-Zandani said, in his interview with the Qatar News Agency, 
that some of them were still members of the House of 
Representatives' presidential commission, and that there were 
other members of House of Representatives who were now among the 
most vehement opponents of the Socialists. 
  He added that "the wartime conditions could not besiege 
several Socialist Party members of the House of Representatives, 
who left the House of Representatives when some roads were 
blocked." In response to a question about the military 
situation, al-Zandani expressed "regret, because our brothers, 
especially those close to us, have not made the effort to seek 
out the facts." He went on to say that "union forces now are 
close to Aden, in Abyan. The media attacking us says that the 
battles are taking place on the former border. We do not know 
whether the call for Arab unity has now become a crime, or 
perhaps the union of Arab countries is now an atrocity. Is it 
now a crime to safeguard our legitimate government, freely 
chosen by the people, and to oppose a mutiny? We cry to God 
about this oppression of our loved ones, neighbors, and 
brothers." 
  He said that the city of al-Dali' was now under union 
forces' 
control, and that the people in the Southern provinces only 
wanted to be reassured that the government would protect them 
from communist oppression, for them to show their true feelings. 
He indicated that secessionist brigades were surrendering one 
after the other, and joining the forces of the legitimate 
government. 
  He explained that the biggest obstacle on the road to Aden 
now was the site of al-'Anad [military base], as it was a very 
strong fortress, with an airport and various equipment, and was 
surrounded by steep mountains. 
  Turning to rumors that some Arabs, from Sudan and Iraq, were 
fighting alongside government forces in Yemen, the member of 
Yemen's Presidential Council said that these reports had 
absolutely no basis in truth. He said Sudan itself had denied 
it, and that there had been Iraqis in Aden for a long time; 
there were also Somalis fleeing the war in a camp in the 
Southern governorates. 
  He expressed his regret that there was "media deception 
whose 
objective was to mislead," and that there was "a political 
movement at the pan-Arab level, based on the circumstances of 
the Gulf war, and for other reasons, to slander some Arab 
countries." 
  Addressing Qatar's position on the crisis, Shaykh al-Zandani 
said that "our brothers in Qatar have a special place in our 
hearts, a place that has grown even dearer in this crisis. A 
friend in need is a friend indeed. Our brothers in Qatar have 
stood with us in our predicament, and stood with truth, unity, 
and legitimacy, and with their faith. They have adopted clear 
positions for which we thank them." He went on to say, "We say 
to the Arabs, `Ask yourselves, do you support mutiny against 
governments? Are you now for a socialist, communist party that 
fights Islam?'" In response to a question about whether the 
Southern forces had foreign backing, Shaykh al-Zandani that 
"there is foreign backing, which we know about. If it weren't 
for this foreign backing, they would never have dared to get 
involved in something like this. But if this aid reaches those 
who cannot use it, it will hurt the recipient and the giver." 
Al-Zandani expressed his confidence that this would do nothing 
to change the balance of power; it would not tip the scale in 
favor of the mutiny. He said, "We are in the right, and God will 
give us victory." Al-Zandani concluded by directing his remarks 
to Yemeni communities abroad, saying that "this is a decisive 
time for defining our position on this faction which has 
abandoned its nation, faith, and consensus. Your army and your 
people are dealing with this faction the only way they 
understand."

  [Text] Sanaa--Mosque preachers in the Yemeni capital called 
yesterday for "maintaining jihad for God's sake" and in order to 
rid the country of what they described as the "enemies of God 
and his Prophet." That was a clear reference to the military 
confrontation, currently in its third successive week, between 
forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Chamber of 
Deputies Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, and other 
forces loyal to 'Ali Salim al-Bid and leaders of the Yemeni 
Socialist Party whom Sanaa regards as insurrectionists against 
legitimate authority. 
  Mosque preachers, in their Friday sermons, did not consider 
it inconceivable that "the current war would continue for a few 
more days or even for months" since, in their opinion, it takes 
patience and wisdom to overpower and defeat enemy strongholds. 
They noted that the mujahidin, as they called them, waged a 
fierce battle at Mihwar al-Hind, some 60 km from Aden where, 
they pointed out, most concrete fortifications exceed two meters 
in thickness. And yet, they said the lightly armed mujahidin 
charged them and secured them with a minimum of losses compared 
to enemy casualties. That claim is consistent with communiques 
issued by Sanaa, which continues to claim control of the base 
despite Aden's assertions to the contrary. 
  The preachers asserted that groups of Yemeni civilians have 
volunteered in what they called the "jihad for God's sake" and 
joined the ranks of regular forces that are engaged in fierce 
fighting in order to achieve their mission. They added that the 
volunteers have joined various divisions in solidarity with 
their warring brethren and in order that "they all may celebrate 
clear victory," as the preachers put it. 
  In a related development, an informed source in Sanaa 
shrugged off the impact of the "volunteer mujahidin" who include 
groups of Arab Afghans as well as militias of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping. He opined that they could have no stronger impact on 
the battle than either the "deluded" Socialist Party militias or 
those whom 'Ali Salim al-Bid and his supporters dispatched to 
the mountains of al-Dali', Radfan, etc., in order to regain lost 
territories by engaging regular troops in guerrilla warfare. 
  Asked whether the war, or military confrontation, between 
well-trained and fully equipped armed forces regulars threatens 
to become guerrilla warfare or war among groups of volunteers 
spread beyond the military fronts, the Sanaa source said that 
"it is unlikely that things will reach this level of complexity 
and foreboding that some people dread. The reason, he 
emphasized, is that both warring parties in Sanaa and Aden know 
full well that it would undermine their interests to allow their 
conflict to escalate to that extent, since both of them are keen 
on remaining in power one way or another." Should the war 
continue or expand, both parties to the confrontation could 
forfeit their positions by losing the initiative, especially in 
the event of a prolonged military confrontation, which the 
source deemed to be "unlikely." 
  Both Sanaa and Aden acknowledged in their military 
communiques that a number of "intrepid citizens" from various 
parts of Yemen are involved in the military confrontations and 
are engaged with the regular forces "in achieving military 
victories and vanquishing the enemy." 
  Some observers regard this with a degree of uneasiness and 
trepidation. They believe that the development, and the openness 
with which it is discussed in military communiques and mosque 
sermons, does not forebode a quick conclusion and may indeed 
escalate the military confrontation into a civil war where each 
of the parties may be forced to deploy its civilian supporters 
into militias or tribal forces, thereby driving the battle 
beyond the fronts into various parts of Yemen. That, should it 
happen, would take a long time and tremendous effort to quell. 
  Those observers also view the semantic use of "jihad" to 
describe current skirmishes in certain sections of Sanaa between 
the forces of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the forces of 
his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid, as something that undermines 
President Salih's position and his justifications for his war 
with al-Bid's forces. President Salih, having won the support of 
a comfortable majority of northern members of the Yemeni Chamber 
of Deputies, claims that "al-Bid and his supporters are 
insurgents against the constitutional authority" and must 
therefore be "pursued, apprehended, and made to stand trial." 
The debate on jihad, while it seems to rebut President Salih's 
claims, is consistent with al-Bid's statements on the 
confrontation between the southern forces and the forces of 
President Salih and his fundamentalist supporters who, in his 
view, "want to regress the country to the way things were 
centuries ago." 
  Some observers believe that by recently relinquishing the 
word "terrorists" in favor of the term "Sanaa-supported 
fundamentalists," especially since the military confrontation 
began, al-Bid and his supporters are seeking to gain the support 
of Arab and Western countries that are apprehensive about the 
potential of the religious movement in Yemen rising to power. 
  Observers therefore expect President Salih and his 
supporters 
to be alert to some of the caveats for which the West is closely 
watching, and he may deal with those caveats in an unexpected 
manner. President Salih has assured the West, and particularly 
the United States, that once he resolves the conflict with 
al-Bid and his supporters, his immediate focus will be on 
"making up for the mistakes of the past and on building a new 
Yemen on a foundation of unity, democracy, political plurality, 
respect for human rights, comprehensive development, social 
progress, and the administrative and fiscal decentralization of 
local governance." 
  Those assurances notwithstanding, the Western countries are 
not satisfied with mere "promises" and are relying primarily on 
their sources for reports, information, and supported figures to 
determine the extent to which those promises have been 
translated into pragmatic measures and actual realities. 
  Observers fear that President Salih may not be able to 
maintain his control of the religious movement in the Yemeni 
Reform Grouping with which he is currently allied in his drive 
to eliminate the leaders of the Socialist Party. This may prove 
even more difficult should they actually succeed in achieving 
their mutual objective and emerge victorious from this 
confrontation. This is something that President Salih must 
consider with great care in his quest for the West's trust and 
for better treatment by it. Not only that, he must also 
consolidate his rapprochement with countries of the Gulf and 
with other nations that view the "problem of fundamentalism" 
with great trepidation.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Stinger Finds Way Into Valley"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, May 10. 
  A new and dangerous dimension has been added to the Kashmir 
militancy with the first ever recovery of the highly capable 
U.S.-made shoulder-fired surface-to-air Stinger missile by the 
army in the Valley on April 30. 
  Initial reports had mentioned that a five foot long missile 
had been recovered by a routine army patrol close to the border 
in the Valley's high altitude Kupwara sector. Along with the 
missile, the army had recovered two rockets and a booster. 
  However, while credible sources here confirm that the 
missile 
was a Stinger, it has been difficult to obtain further details 
in view of the claim that the missile was destroyed while being 
transported to an army formation headquarters. One army jawan 
was reported to have been injured in this claimed incident. 
  This is the first substantive report among many rumours and 
claims in the past that the dreaded Stinger missile has actually 
entered the Valley. It is also the first time that a Stinger 
missile has been recovered by security forces in any of the 
terrorist and insurgency stricken areas in the country. 
  The introduction of the shoulder fired Stinger adds a lethal 
dimension to Pakistan backed terrorism in the Valley. Not only 
does this U.S.-made missile render vulnerable commercial and 
VVIP [very very important person] aircraft flying in the valley, 
but it also impedes routine sortie flying and occasional air 
exercises undertaken by Indian Air Force fighter aircraft in the 
Valley. 
  In winter when the Valley is cut off by road owing to heavy 
snowfall and landslides, the only link between the Valley and 
the rest of the country is by air. 
  It is noteworthy to mention here that it had been the US 
made 
Stinger which had decisively tilted the balance against the 
Russians in Afghanistan despite the former's advanced military 
power. The Stinger, which has an advanced heat-seeking missile 
can detect the hot exhaust of an aircraft at even four miles 
away and upto 5,000 feet in altitude. 
  The Americans no doubt have been making efforts to recover 
each and every Stinger missile it had initially given out but 
evidently has not been entirely successful in this mission. 
  The more readily available Russian SA-7 Grail shoulder fired 
infra-red missile is way behind its U.S. counterpart in terms of 
accuracy and range. 
  In the recent past, hauls of sophisticated weaponary in the 
Valley supplied by Pakistan have ranged from 107 mm artillery 
shells, fin stabilised 57 mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm 
mortars, high velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic 
grenade launchers, disposable rocket launchers, grenades of NATO 
origin, long-range high-frequency sophisticated wireless sets 
with multi-mode facilities and even U.S. made portable solar 
panels for charging batteries for wireless sets.

  [Text] Jammu, May 10 (UNI). 
  The Israel government has offered its expertise and 
technical 
know-how for sealing the border and high mountain passes along 
the line of control (LOC) in the Kashmir valley. 
  Highly-placed defence sources said here today that a 
proposal 
to this effect was lying with the Indian government and a final 
decision was likely to be taken after the Prime Minister, Mr. 
P.V. Narasimha Rao, returned from his visit to the United States. 
  The sources said the proposal had already been studied by de 
fence experts and the home ministry was likely to make a final 
draft for putting up before the Union cabinet. 
  A team of Israeli defence experts was also likely to visit 
India in this regard in the near future, the sources said. 
  The proposal envisages sealing in patches nearly 600 km of 
border stretch along the tough terrain of the valley. 
  The Israelis have offered to install electronic wiring 
system 
with alarm and beeper signals which would detect human movement. 
  The sources said the electronic signal system would be put 
on 
ground along the line of control and whenever there was an 
infiltration bid by the militants, the alarm would go off giving 
indications and quick reaction time to the security forces to 
deal with the intruders. 
  They said if the proposal comes through and is put into 
action before the month of June, it would prove to be a "death 
blow" to the inter services intelligence [ISI] plans for massive 
infiltration along the LOC. 
  If an agreement is made, it would be the first defence 
tie-up 
between India and Israel after both countries established 
diplomatic relations. 
  The sources said intelligence and army had received quite a 
few authentic reports that the ISI was planning to send in only 
foreign mercenaries during the summer season. 
  The sources said three regular battalions of Afghan 
mujahideens were being raised by ISI at Muzafarabad in 
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. They were being provided with the 
latest weaponry for infiltration 
  The sources said they were waiting across the border along 
the LOC looking for the right moment to slip into the Indian 
side with a large cache of arms. The decision to send in Afghan 
veterans for fighting security forces in Kashmir had two reasons. 
  One, the ISI is finding it difficult to motivate the local 
Kashmiri youth to come across the border and join the militant 
ranks. The second is that the ISI feels that the level of 
violence needs to be stepped up and for that the Afghan 
mujahideens, who had a reputation for being ruthless, would take 
over the leadership of militants and go in for massive 
destruction of life and property.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 9. 
  Mr. Salman Kurshid, Minister of State for External Affairs, 
said the Government was in no way associated with the meeting on 
Tibet held here by some parliamentarians from March 18-20. 
  The Government's position was that Tibet is an autonomous 
region of China. Under Indian laws, individuals had the right to 
express their opinion freely. It was the Government's hope that 
non-official activities of certain individuals would not affect 
the ongoing process of improvement of Sino-Indian relations. 
  This position had been conveyed to the Chinese Government, 
he 
said in a written reply, during question hour in the Lok Sabha. 
<H5>  Friendly Ties with Dhaka </H5>
  India is committed to the maintenance of friendly and 
cooperative relations with Bangladesh. The dialogue with that 
country to resolve outstanding issues as also India's endeavors 
to consolidate bilateral cooperation would continue, Mr. Kurshid 
said. 
  The major bilateral issues to be resolved with Bangladesh 
included sharing of waters of the common rivers, early 
completion of the repatriation of Chakma refugees, illegal 
immigration from Bangladesh, insurgency-related developments and 
further expansion of cultural, commercial and economic 
cooperation. 
  The Government had made an offer to several heads of 
missions 
accredited to India to facilitate a visit to Jammu and Kashmir. 
  These included ambassadors from Islamic and other countries. 
In pursuance of this, since February, 1994 three groups of 
envoys, including heads of missions from some Islamic countries, 
have visited Jammu and Kashmir. The Government arranged the 
logistics. A programme of briefings and visits was arranged in 
consultation with the State authorities. The heads of missions 
utilised the visit to meet a wide section of people in the 
State, Mr. Khurshid said. 
<H5>  Pak. Propaganda Countered </H5>
  Pakistan was carrying out an extensive propaganda on Kashmir 
in the U.S. with the help of anti-India elements. Adequate 
resources had been provided to the Indian Embassy and consulates 
to counter such propaganda, he said. 
  The Government had also engaged the services of a lobbying 
firm in the U.S. to supplement the efforts of the Indian 
missions. The Government was apprising other governments of 
Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism. 
  The Government had seen reports about a sizable number of 
highly trained and well-armed foreign mercenaries, including 
Afghan nationals, infiltrating into the State with the covert 
support of Pakistan and who were indulging in acts of subversion 
and terrorism. 
  According to reports, a few thousand such mercenaries are 
still in Pakistan. 
  The Government was maintaining constant vigil and taking all 
measures to combat terrorism and to safeguard, at all costs, the 
unity and territorial integrity of the nation, Mr. Khurshid 
said. -- UNI

  [Text] Bombay, May 14 -- Expressing concern over the 
double-digit rate of inflation at 11.5 percent, the Governor of 
the Reserve Bank of India [RBI], Dr C. Rangarajan, today 
proposed to bring it down by four percent before the end of the 
current financial year. 
  Announcing the RBI's credit and monetary policy for the 
first 
six months of 1994-95, Dr Rangarajan said that banks had been 
asked to increase their Cash Reserve Ratio [CRR] from 14 percent 
to 15 percent in three phases. Also, the SLR [statutory 
liquidity ratio] would be reduced from 34.75 percent to 33.75 
percent in two phases, he said. 
  In a communication to the heads of commercial banks, the RBI 
stated that the increase in CRR by one percent would impound Rs 
3,700 crores. The first phase, effective from June 11, would 
increase CRR from 14 percent to 14.5 percent; the second phase, 
beginning July 9, would increase it to 14.75 percent and third 
phase of 15 percent CRR would take effect on August 6. 
  The proposed decrease in SLR from 34.75 percent to 34.25 
percent would take effect from August 20 while it would come 
down to 33.75 percent in September. This would release Rs 2,600 
crores which would help commercial banks with additional 
resources. The policy does not envisage any changes in the 
structure of interest rates. 
  PTI adds: Describing the measures as a "tight policy", Dr 
Rangarajan said that with effect from May 16, the RBI had raised 
across-the-board the minimum margins on bank advances against 
pulses, oilseeds and vegetable oils and cotton and kapas by 15 
percentage points. 
  For commodities where there was a stipulation on the level 
of 
credit ceilings, the reference period was brought forward by one 
year to three years ending 1992-93 (November-October). 
  The maximum term deposit rate on non-resident (external) 
rupee accounts has been reduced by one percentage point from the 
existing "not exceeding 11 percent" to "not exceeding 10 
percent" from May 16. 
  The banks would have flexibility, within the overall ceiling 
of five percent, to hold shares (including public sector 
undertakings equity) or debentures, with the abolishing of the 
sub-ceiling of 1.5 percent for holding of corporate shares. 
  Dr Rangarajan also announced setting up of the Securities 
Trading Corporation of India (STCI), a measure to activate the 
secondary market in Government securities, within the next 
couple of months. 
  As per the definitional changes made in priority sector 
lending, the net funds provided by sponsor banks to regional 
rural banks would be treated as priority sector lendings and 
advances up to Rs 5 lakhs would be granted for financing 
distribution of inputs for activities allied to agriculture. 
  The running account facility, under pre-shipment credit in 
foreign currency available to exporters of gems and jewellery, 
has been extended to other exporters with a good track record. 
  The general line of Credit-I to the National Bank for 
Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) for seasonal 
agricultural operations has been enhanced by Rs 400 crores to Rs 
4,100 crores and to meet the increased need of the non-farm 
sector, the general line of credit-II has been enhanced by Rs 
100 crores to Rs 750 crores.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 4 -- India has closed the financial 
year 1993-94 with an export growth of 20.37 percent in dollar 
terms, thus comfortably achieving the export target set for the 
year. 
  The latest trade data released by the Ministry of Commerce 
shows that against a target of $22.138 million set for the whole 
year 1993-94, the country recorded exports of $22,173.06 
million, marginally exceeding the overall export target for the 
year. Exports during the full year 1992-93 were worth $18,420.49 
million. 
  However, there was a significant increase in the imports too 
which grew by 6.84 percent in dollar terms during 1993-94. 
Official estimates show that imports would be worth $23,212.13 
million as against $21,725.54 million during 1992-93. This also 
further increases the trade gap to $1,039.07 million which had 
been successfully brought down to the level of $600-$650 million 
even earlier this year. Nevertheless, the trade gap is still 
substantially less than the 1992-93 figure of $3,305.05 million. 
  According to the provisional estimates released by the 
Directorate-General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, 
in rupee terms, exports during 1993-94 were estimated at Rs 
69,546.91 crores, 30.36 percent up from the 1992-93 level of Rs 
53,350.54 crores. 
  Against this, imports were of Rs 72,806.01 crores during the 
year against Rs 62,922.80 crores in 1992-93, showing an increase 
of 15.71 percent. In rupee terms, the trade deficit declined 
from Rs 9,572.26 crores in 1992-93 to Rs 3,259.10 crores during 
1993-94. 
  The upsurge in imports this year has been mainly due to the 
extensive concessions given to the industry on import duty in 
various sectors. Imports registered a more than 50 percent 
increase during March 1994 taking the overall import figure 
higher up thereby increasing the trade gap to the present level 
of almost $1.4 billion.

<F P=106> [Article by F.J. Khergamvala: "A Black Mark Against Indian </F>
Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] Manama (Bahrain), May 10. 
  Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife of the U.S. President, has 
described the events in South Africa today as the greatest day 
of the 20th century. Few would disagree with that, but among 
those few are the Indian political leadership, including the 
Opposition. Otherwise, considering every foreign policy 
denominator, India should have been represented in Pretoria at 
the highest political level from each party. 
  The Vice President, Mr. K.R. Narayanan, is no doubt high 
ranking in the Indian order, but on the world scale the post of 
an Indian Vice President does not count. Not for this event in 
any case. By any yardstick, the presence of over a million 
Indians in South Africa, India's historical leadership in the 
fight against apartheid, future economic and political interests 
in the Indian Ocean region with a major power and purely from 
the point of national sentiment should have compelled the top 
Indian leadership to be present in Pretoria, irrespective of 
whether it is close to a working visit to the U.S. This is a 
sentiment very widely shared among senior Indian diplomats. 
Without exception, it is their view that Rajiv Gandhi would have 
certainly not missed the moment. Those who pretend to swear by 
his ideals certainly have missed the opportunity of shaking the 
hand of one of the greatest men of this century during his 
finest hour. 
  Pakistan, Portugal, Ireland, to name a few, have hardly any 
ties or a historical record to speak of with South Africa, 
compared with that of India. But they are all there either 
represented by the President or the Prime Minister. One 
commentator perhaps diagnosed the malaise accurately. He felt 
that beyond the U.S. and Pakistan nothing ever makes this 
leadership sit up and grab an opportunity. The fundamental 
moorings of Indian foreign policy are being taken apart, root by 
root. Despite all the noise against Islamabad, any objective 
Indian observer must hand it to Pakistan that it seldom loses an 
opportunity to make its point. The Commonwealth summit in 
Limassol was a case in point, where Ms. Benazir Bhutto rushed 
there immediately after her inauguration with New Delhi left 
making excuses. 
  Dr. Fidel Castro, Mr. Yasser Arafat, Dr. Robert Mugabe, all 
cause celebre of the Non-aligned Movement rubbed 
shoulders with the likes of an American Vice President and the 
country's First Lady. Even Israel's President was there, a true 
indication of how countries can dexterously indicate recognition 
of new interests. It is something to be noted that of all 
countries that are touchy or sensitive about foreign leaders 
being absent from an event being hosted, India ranks at the top. 
The poor attendance at the second attempt at a G-15 summit a 
month and half back was perhaps a good indication of how others 
respond to a country whose leadership is appearing increasingly 
insular. Spokesmen will, of course, provide all the reasons, 
that a warm message was carried by the Vice President, that 
India was suitably represented, but the fact remains that in 
Pretoria's record books India did not take the occasion 
seriously enough. New Delhi knows this very well because the 
Ministry of External Affairs [MEA] itself keeps a close account 
of which country did or did not send leaders for funerals in New 
Delhi. 
  There had been some speculation among Indian officials that 
India's Prime Minister wished to avoid encounters with his 
Pakistani counterpart. It would probably more accurate to say 
that the age and infirmity of Indian leaders lies behind their 
reluctance to undertake such a historical mission. The leaders 
of each of India's political parties are doubtless either very 
old or not fit enough. 
  Ordinarily, a strong External Affairs Minister would press 
the country's Prime Minister to attend such a world event. But 
then the quality of the political leadership in the MEA is all 
too well known. Correspondingly, the visit of key Opposition 
leaders is either initiated and organised by the External 
Affairs Minister or requests come in from these opposition 
figures that they would like to be present in an official Indian 
delegation at such events. A bit sarcastically, perhaps there is 
indeed a consensus in India among the opposition and with the 
ruling party. All they think of and speak about are Pakistan and 
the U.S. The message sent out to the Indians in South Africa and 
those who now govern them is not a healthy one.

circulated by the government to leaders of political parties at 
a meeting convened by the Lok Sabha Speaker, Mr. Shivraj V. 
Patil. 
  The proposed Constitution Bill seeks to confer powers to 
Election Commissioners on par with the Chief Election 
Commissioner through amendment to Article 324 with a view to 
equating other Election Commissioners with the CEC in the matter 
of their removal from office, provide for the conduct of the 
business of the Election Commission and prohibit members of 
Election Commission from holding any other office after they 
cease to be members. 
  The draft Constitution Bill seeks to insert new Article 324A 
to ensure that the "business of the Election Commission shall be 
transacted by the Election Commission as a whole and if the 
Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners 
differ in opinion on any matter, such matter shall be decided 
according to the opinion of the majority". 
<H5>  Delimitation of Constituencies </H5>
  The Bill proposes fresh delimitation of constituencies on 
the 
basis of 1991 census through amendment to Article 81, 82 and 
170. Under the existing provisions of the Constitution, no 
delimitation of constituencies is required to be undertaken 
until the figures for the first census taken after the year 2000 
have been published. 
  Among the significant amendments proposed by the government 
to the RPA include the provisions for amendment of provision 28 
relating to issue of identity cards for electors in notified 
constituencies and provision 43 relating to residential status 
of a member of Rajya Sabha. 
  While retaining the powers of the Election Commission on 
directions to issue identity girds to voters, a new section in 
the form of 28A is sought to be inserted to make it mandatory 
for the EC to get prior approval of the Union Government on any 
its directions relating to identity cards. 
  Section of 43 of RPA is sought to be amended so that a 
person 
shall not be qualified to be chosen as a representative of any 
State or Union Territory in the council of States unless he is 
an elector for any parliamentary constituency. 
<H5>  De-registration of Party </H5>
  Section 29A is proposed to be amended so that no association 
or body shall be registered as a political party if it bears a 
religious name and the memorandum or rules and regulations do 
not conform to provisions of the constitution. Any appeal 
against a decision of the Commission on the subject shall lie 
with the Supreme Court within a period of a month from the date 
of order by the Commission. 
  De-registration of political parties, it has been proposed, 
may be made by a high court within whose jurisdiction the main 
office of that party is situated if it promotes or attempts to 
promote on ground of religion, disharmony or feelings of enmity, 
hatred or ill-will between different religious groups. 
  The draft amendment to Section 30 (D) of RPA Act proposes to 
shorten the minimum of campaigning period from 21 to 14 days. 
Amendment to Section 34 envisages a minimum security deposit of 
Rs. 1000 by a candidate of a recognised political party and Rs. 
5000 by in independent candidate. It is only Rs. 500 for SC/ST 
[expansion not given] candidates. 
  A new section is proposed substituting the existing Section 
52 of RPA on procedure to be adopted on the death of a candidate 
of a recognised political party before poll. The proposal is not 
to countermand an election on the death of any candidate. In 
case of death of candidate set up by a recognised political 
party, the election should be adjourned for a fortnight and the 
recognised political party should be allowed to nominate a new 
candidate within two days of the death of its candidate. 
  A new part with a new section to be called 78A is proposed 
to 
be introduced to RPA to make a beginning towards state funding 
of elections to candidates of recognised political parties. 
Supply of free copies of electoral rolls, certain quantity of 
petrol, a certain number of vehicles as may be laid down by the 
Union Government and payment of hire charges for microphones is 
envisaged.

<F P=106> [Commentary from New Delhi: "Why Is V.P. Singh Not Accepting </F>
Party General Secretary Position?"] 
  [Text] The consensus of the veteran leaders of Janata Dal 
[JD] is that V.P. Singh is not accepting the party leader 
position because he is himself convinced that the party can no 
longer be saved from splintering and disintegrating. These 
leaders have tried to explain to Singh in the past two days that 
if he does not accept the leadership, the party will face more 
factions and will disintegrate completely, but Singh fears that 
the party is falling apart anyway, and also that the blame might 
come to him, should he take on the reins at this moment. 
  Vishwanath Pratap Singh has told his confidants that he will 
not accept the party leadership. He has also warned against 
bringing popular pressure to make him the leader by saying he 
will explain to the masses his reasons for not seeking party 
leadership. Sources close to him say that some people have a 
vested interest in Singh becoming the leader of the party. 
  According to sources, V.P. Singh wants to create a national 
alternative [to the present government] without aligning with 
JD. He aspires to see a grouping of the backward, the depressed, 
and the Muslims emerge as one force. He would like to bring 
together the leftovers of the JD, Mulayam Singh's Samajwadi 
Party, Kanshiram's Bahujan Samaj Party, as well as other parties 
representing depressed classes, and unite them all into one 
group. Singh believes that the JD has run its course and 
fulfilled its objectives, and now there is the need for a new 
party. The JD has already broken into three factions, and now 
the fourth factious group is forming. According to sources in 
the Congress (I), this new group may at anytime be announced as 
the new party. The JD is finished in many of the states. V.P. 
Singh appreciates this very well and is therefore apprehensive 
of accepting party leadership. Singh has already spoken with 
Kanshiram in Bombay. He is in Lucknow today, where a talk with 
Mulayam Singh is scheduled. According to JD sources, in Uttar 
Pradesh, the JD is completely defunct, and in Bihar, it is 
extremely weakened, and exists only in name. The chief minister 
of Bihar, Lalu Prasad Yadav, is pressuring Singh the most to 
become the leader. People close to Singh say that when Singh was 
the leader in the past, Lalu Yadav disregarded him and 
constantly ignored his directives to show himself the more 
powerful and may wish to form such conditions to return. 
  Even now Lalu Yadav wants Singh to become the leader once 
more only because then he will not have to worry about 
interference in state affairs and he can exert his own wishes in 
Assembly elections, etc. In Bihar, the JD is divided into three 
camps--of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Ramvilas Paswan, and Nitish. There 
is serious talk that Nitish's camp is going to separate from JD 
soon. 
  Rabi Roy's announcement of starting a new party in Orissa 
has 
caused V.P. Singh some concern. Rabi Roy is a senior leader who 
is accusing Biju Patnaik of establishing his own government in 
Orissa, which is not JD, and gives that as his reason for 
starting the new party. The Samajwadis of JD, like George 
Fernandez and Madhu Dandavate, are telling Mulayam Singh Yadav 
that they are frustrated with the communal tendencies in JD and 
that they want to adopt the Samajwadi Party's manifesto inspired 
by social reformers like [Ram Manohar] Lohia. Ramvilas Paswan 
has told V.P. Singh that, if he does become the leader, then he 
will consider giving his group called the "Dalit Sena" some 
political form. 
  V.P. Singh is all too familiar with these internal problems 
of JD, and so he is not feeling confidant that this fractured 
party can once again grow together into a whole and cohesive 
group. Its long-known Mandal slogan is also finished, and 
reviving it looks next to impossible. In addition, Singh's 
health has suffered gravely, and has rendered him apprehensive 
of taking excessive responsibilities. 
  According to sources in the Congress Party, the Bihar JD has 
also become increasingly factious. The party members are quite 
upset with Chief Minister Lalu Yadav's administrative programs. 
His Cabinet is openly criticizing him. Some prominent 
legislators like Abdul Gafur, Nitish, and George Fernandez have 
participated in open criticism of Lalu. 
  In addition, Singh has announced many times that the highest 
position in the JD should be given to a representative of the 
backward or depressed class. Ramakrishna Hegde has reminded him 
of this through special correspondence. Another reason Singh 
will not seek leadership may be that he does not wish to retract 
his pronouncements.

  [Text] Chandigarh, May 4 -- The Akali Dal (Longowal) today 
revolted against the newly-formed Akali Dal and rejected the 
"Amritsar Declaration" made by the six-member committee, report 
UNI and PTI. 
  The former Home Minister and the Akali Dal (Longowal) 
general 
secretary, Captain Kanwaljit Today Singh, said the declaration 
violated the spirit of the Guru Granth Sahib and "I completely 
and thoroughly reject it." 
  Describing the declaration as "anti-Sikh, anti-Punjabi and 
anti-nation", the Akali leader appealed to the Sikh masses also 
to reject it. 
  Meanwhile, the president of the Akali Dal (Mann), Mr 
Simranjit Singh Mann, today asked the Centre and the State 
Government to impose a ban on the Shiromani Akali Dal and warned 
that the Akalis would not entertain threats from any quarter. 
  Addressing a press conference here, he said the Akali Dal 
leaders are meeting at the Akal Takht on May 6 to discuss the 
threat reportedly held out by the Union Home Minister, Mr S. B. 
Chavan, and the Punjab Chief Minister, Mr Beant Singh, and to 
chalk out the future course of action. 
  When asked whether Mr Parkash Singh Badal would also attend 
the meeting, he said: "I hope that all Akali Dal leaders would 
attend the meeting." 
  Referring to reports that Mr Badal would show his strength 
at 
the Akal Takht, Mr Mann said: "One should show humility and not 
strength at the Akal Takht." 
  He said that the Akali Dal would not contest the 
by-elections 
in Punjab as it felt that the elections would not be free and 
fair. He said that the Dal would participate in future elections 
but the same should be held in the presence of the SAARC and the 
Commonwealth observers. He said the Dal proposed to write to the 
Chief Election Commissioner making such a request. 
  The desperate stand of the Akali Dal leaders at Amritsar 
would prove disastrous as it was an attempt to "rekindle the 
flames of violence", he added. 
  The Minister of State for Public Health and Public 
Relations, 
Mr Surendra Kapoor, today appreciated Capt Kanwaljit Singh's 
decision in rejecting the so-called "Amritsar Declaration" 
adopted by the newly-formed Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) 
seeking a separate area for the Sikhs. 
  Meanwhile, the Punjab unit of the CPI(M) today described the 
"Amritsar Declaration" of the newly formed Akali Dal as "most 
unfortunate development", saying it would provide "strong 
ideological basis to the secessionist forces." 
  In a statement here, the party State secretary, Mr Mangat 
Ram 
Pasla, said: "The declaration is not only similar to the 
Anandpur Sahib resolution of 1973 but it also legitimises the 
activities of Khalistani marauders".

<F P=106> [Article by Gautam Chaudhuri] </F>
  [Text] Disenchanted with the internecine squabble between 
the two major Jharkhand groups, yet another militant outfit, the 
Jharkhand Bahujan Party [JBP], has decided to take up the cause 
of the Jharkhandis, preferring, however, to steer clear of the 
political muddle for the present and pitching its campaign more 
on ideological grounds. 
  Till now, the new group has limited its activity to the East 
Singbhum district of Bihar, stretching from Chandil Dam to 
Bahragora. The area has a population of about 1.5 million with a 
vast majority of landless tribals. 
  The immediate plan is to use the base at East Singbhum as a 
springboard to extend its activities to the entire Jharkhand 
belt, in stages, to ensure that, in the future, the JBP can 
challenge the other two major groups, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha 
[JMM] (Shibu Soren) and the JMM (Mandi), on the strength of its 
mass base. 
  While Mr Babloo Murmu is general secretary of the JBP, most 
of its other leaders had been associated with the JMM (Soren) or 
the JMM (Mandi). 
  According to information received in Calcutta, the JBP has 
given an impassioned call for "Save Dhalbhumgarh", in an obvious 
attempt to use the sentiments of the local inhabitants in its 
favour. The campaign is against all kinds of pollution -- 
environmental, political, linguistic and cultural. 
  For this, the party is using folk mediums, like 
jhumoor dances, and plays, to reach the people. 
  Causes dear to tribal life, like deforestation, are being 
taken up, to ensure that the campaign embraces all aspects of 
tribal life and culture. 
  The immediate take-off point of the agitation, when it 
started about a year ago, was the environmental issue. 
Agitations were periodically held in protest against the 
pollution of the Subarnarekha river by the public sector 
company, Hindusthan Copper. 
  Public protests were subsequently organized by the JBP 
against the World Bank-aided Subarnarekha project. They 
protested against the displacement of the local inhabitants for 
the project. 
  The moderate success of the agitations has now emboldened 
the 
JBP to guide the campaign against economic exploitation of the 
tribals in the mineral-rich East Singbhum. 
  It has taken up other causes on behalf of the tribals. It 
protested against the widespread destruction of the forest at 
Dalma, Lakhaisari and Paora. 
  This had disturbed the traditional abode of elephants and 
had 
forced them to come to the plains of West Bengal, Bihar and 
Orissa. 
  The JBP is opposing the State Government's efforts to 
construct irrigation canals in the tribal belt and, 
particularly, the onslaught on traditional occupations of the 
tribals. This is forcing them to leave their homes and take up 
jobs for daily wages. 
  With the two major Jharkhand groups busy crossing swords 
and, 
seemingly, falling to the machinations of established parties, 
the JBP campaign is said to be gradually gaining ground among 
the people. 
  There is cause for comfort for the JBP because of what they 
term "active support being received from a majority of 
non-tribals as well".

  [Text] Amritsar, May 12 -- Under the supervision of the 
Akal Takht, the heads of five Sikh students' federation factions 
today announced the dissolution of their respective groups and 
agreed to form a unified All-India Sikh Students' Federation 
[AISSF], reports UNI. 
  The unified group of the AISSF will function as an 
independent, but affiliated, students' wing of the Shiromani 
Akali Dal (Amritsar), formed under the directives of the Akal 
Takht. 
  The formation of the unified AISSF was officially announced 
by the acting Jathedar of the Akal Takht, Mr Manjit Singh, 
inside the Golden Temple. 
  A five-member supreme council, which will function as the 
decision-making body of this new group, was also formed. 
  The factions dissolved were those headed by Mr Jasbir Singh 
Ghuman, Mr Harminder Singh Gill, Mr Virsa Singh Valtoha, Mr 
Gurdip Singh Nagowal and Mr Bhupinder Singh Khalsa. Another 
group, calling itself the World Sikh Youth Organization, has 
also expressed its willingness to merge with the unified AISSF. 
  While Mr Ghuman headed the faction owing allegiance to the 
chief of Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, Mr Gurcharan 
Singh Tohra, Mr Gill headed the Manjit Singh faction. Mr Valtoha 
was the leader of the Babbar Vidyarthi Jathebandi, affiliated to 
the dissolved Babbar Akali Dal and Mr Nagowal was the head of 
the breakaway faction of the federation aligned to the Mann 
group. Mr Khalsa also led another breakaway faction, an 
independent group. 
  The heads of the five dissolved factions will constitute the 
supreme council of the AISSF. The council will work under the 
guidance of the Akal Takht and "for the benefit of the Sikh 
Panth". 
  Later, speaking to reporters, Mr Jasbir Singh Ghuman also 
announced the formation of a 15-member executive body of the 
AISSF. 
<H5>  Badal's Charge </H5>
  The Akali Dal (Badal) president, Mr Parkash Singh Badal, 
today alleged that the Beant Singh Government was a "blemish on 
the face of Punjab". 
  Launching his party's campaign for the Assembly by-elections 
in Nakodar and Ajnala, Mr Badal urged the people to vote on the 
issue of Mr Beant Singh's stand on the transfer of Chandigarh 
and Punjabi speaking areas and the river waters issue.

  [Text] A research group at [?Tsukuba University] in Tokyo 
announced that more than 60 percent of the Iranians who went to 
Japan looking for work are facing some kind of discrimination in 
that country, and they complain that there is a kind of 
prejudgement of them in the minds of the people of Japan. 
  Professor Hiroshi [?Kumai], chief of this research group, 
said: Studies have begun on the situation with Iranian workers 
in Japan, and it is hoped that the results will help solve the 
problems faced by foreigners living in Japan, especially 
Iranians. 
  Last summer the research group circulated a questionnaire in 
Persian among 245 Iranian workers living in Tokyo and the 
surrounding cities to permit them to write about their lives and 
their problems. 
  According to Professor Hiroshi Kumai, 70 percent of the 
people questioned were between 20 and 30 years of age and each 
has been living in Japan for an average of 25 years [as 
published]. Most are working as simple laborers in construction 
or factories, and 20 percent were unemployed. 
  In this questionnaire the Iranian workers were asked what 
their motivation was for coming to Japan. One in two answered 
that he wanted to increase his work abilities. A number also 
wrote that they had traveled to this country to earn money, find 
work, and to save some money. 
  Sixty percent of the Iranians questioned said they had faced 
some kind of discrimination during their stay in Japan. Some of 
the Iranian workers also believed that technological advances in 
Japanese society have caused the disappearance of humane issues 
and that Japanese employers exploit Iranians as cheap laborers. 
  Professor Kumai concludes from the research that: The 
conditions of Iranian workers in Japan are the worst in 
comparison with the workers from other countries. 
  He advises Japanese officials that discrimination against 
Iranians must be stopped and that attention must be given to 
their demands. Based on statistics the Islamic Republic of Iran 
has published, there are now close to 20,000 Iranians living in 
Japan without valid visas, and most of them have been hired 
illegally in various centers. 
  Since Farvardin 1371 [21 March-20 April 1992], following a 
wave of young unemployed Iranians going to Japan, regulations 
voiding visas between the countries have been cancelled. 
Currently Iranian youths seeking employment make their way to 
Japan through unconventional and difficult routes. For example, 
they will go to Vladivostok in Siberia and from there they get 
to Japan by bribing local officials and boat operators.

  [Text] Tehran, 17 Ordibehesht [7 May] IRNA -- At a 
gathering to study the nation's latest economic changes, Dr. 
Kashan, consultant to the Central Bank of Iran, said: Last year 
the country, whose population has reached 60 million, was 
managed with $7 billion in imports, and this means that the many 
capacities have been created inside the country. 
  Speaking at a joint meeting of the Chamber of Commerce and 
the Iran and Germany Official Industries Organization, he added: 
It is true that in the last two years the country and the banks 
have been faced with delayed payments, but to make up for this 
loss, in the last four years more work was done than projected 
in the Five-Year Plan, and the average growth of 8.1 percent in 
GNP is a good indication of thriving economic activity. 
  The Central Bank consultant said: In the year 1367 [21 March 
1988-20 March 1989] Iran imported 4.5 to 5 million tons of wheat 
per year, while in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] 
and 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] this figure decreased to 
2.5 million tons. Imports of almost 4 million tons of iron and 
steel in the year 1367 changed to exports of 1 million tons of 
these materials in the year 1372. 
  Dr. Kashan said the nation's capacity to produce oil 
by-products increased from 2.5 million barrels per day [BPD] in 
the year 1367 to the present 4.5 million BPD. He added: The 
Islamic Republic of Iran carried out its Five-Year Economic 
Development Plan with fewer than 500 foreign experts, and its 
capital formations grew to 23 percent of GNP. 
  Concerning the extent of Iran's indebtedness, he added: 
Iran's total debts, including the suspended payments and what 
will come due in the future, will be paid in the next five years 
without any problem according to the payment schedule that has 
been established. 
  He added: This is provided that payments are not delayed by 
a 
drop in the value of the dollar against other reputable 
currencies such as the yen and the mark, or by a drop in the 
price of oil.

  [Text] Tehran, 28 Farvardin [17 April] Central News Unit -- 
With the creation of facilities at the nation's airports, entry 
and exit formalities for passengers and the checkpoints for 
inspecting and monitoring passenger documents and luggage have 
been reduced. 
  Bani Najarian, deputy minister of roads and transportation 
and chief of the National Aircraft Organization, in announcing 
the above, added: The checkpoints for monitoring tickets, visas, 
passports, and luggage for passengers coming into the country 
have been reduced from five to two, and from 11 to four for 
departing passengers. 
  Bani Najarian added: In the near future all Iran's 
international airports will perform several monitoring tasks at 
one place, and will deal with passenger issues at another. 
  With regard to passengers departing the country, he said: 
Passengers leaving the country with tickets in hand will only be 
checked once by police and customs agents, and passenger luggage 
will also be inspected by inspection equipment. 
  The passenger greeting section is the next checkpoint. After 
that the validity of passenger visas is checked in one place 
instead of several places. At the last checkpoint, security 
inspections are done. 
  Thus the time spent passing through entry and exit routes 
will be reduced to the smallest amount possible. 
  Likewise, the services at the customs freight section and 
the 
general warehouse for transporting one-way freight and other 
freight coming into the country will operate on a 24-hour basis. 
  According to the deputy minister of roads and 
transportation, 
under a measure enacted at the 52d meeting of the National 
Administrative Council, the Facilities Committee on Standards 
and Assessing Airport Affairs is being formed to create a single 
management at the nation's airports, and it will pursue 
implementation of the aforementioned items.

  [Text] Tehran, 30 Farvardin [19 April] IRNA -- In the 
Second Five-Year Economic, Social, and Cultural Development 
Plan, 250,000 communal housing units will be built for 
low-income individuals. 
  This was announced by 'Abbas Ahmad-Akhundi, minister of 
housing and urban development, at the first one-day gathering of 
chiefs and officials of offices of representatives of the vice 
regent and managers of the organizations throughout the country 
affiliated with the Islamic Republic Housing Foundation. He 
added: These units, which are small in area, will be appropriate 
for young married couples and small families. 
  The minister of housing and urban development added: This 
year construction of 25,000 housing units is planned with the 
necessary budget. 
  He said the average area of these kinds of units will be 
less 
than 50 meters. He said: The price of these kinds of units is 
less than 10 million rials [R], and the budget for it will be 
close to R1 million. 
  Akhundi added: The remaining funds for these units will be 
collected over 15 to 20 years as monthly rentals, which will be 
between R50,000 and R60,000. 
  He noted: The price of the land is a factor in setting the 
price of these units, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban 
Development will oversee the procedure for setting prices and 
deposits. 
  Akhundi cited rural emigration to the cities, especially 
Tehran, as a great problem. He said: If the Housing Foundation, 
in cooperation with the Documents and Deeds Registry 
Organization, can distribute deeds among the rural people, it 
will be doing them the greatest service.

  [Text] Tehran, 20 Ordibehesht [10 May] IRNA -- In an 
interview with IRNA, the deputy executive director of the 
Esfahan Iron Foundry announced: In view of the increased 
production capability, revenues from exporting the products of 
the Esfahan Iron Foundry were more than $131 million in the year 
1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. 
  Continuing, Ahmad Eftekhari, deputy executive director of 
the 
Esfahan Iron Foundry, added: Last year the Esfahan Iron Foundry 
increased its export tonnage 52 percent compared to the year 
1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], and it increased its foreign 
exchange revenues 40 percent. 
  Eftekhari announced that the total sales of the Esfahan Iron 
Foundry for the year 1372 was 1,590,082 tons. 
  He said: Thus sales in 1372 increased 40 percent compared to 
the year 1371, and they increased 100 percent in the second six 
months of the year 1372 [23 September 1993-20 March 1994] 
compared to the first six months of the same year [21 March-22 
September 1993]. 
  The deputy executive director of the Esfahan Iron Foundry 
discussed the domestic market's need for iron rods. He said: By 
the end of the month of Khordad this year [21 June 1994], 35,000 
tons of iron rods in various sizes will enter the market, in 
addition to the previous quantity. 
  He said the Esfahan Iron Foundry delivers an average of 
8,000 
tons of iron per day to customers. He said: This figure 
represents an increase of 2,000 tons per day compared to 
previous days. 
  Ahmad Eftekhari said the Esfahan Iron Foundry exports 60,000 
tons per month in products, based on present contracts.

  [Text] During the First Five-Year Plan, which was extended 
for one year, the Ahvaz Steel Company, the Mobarakeh Steel 
Complex, and the Kavian Steel Company lost $1.3 billion, $688 
million, and $535 million, respectively. 
  The newspaper SALAM, which reported this in its 7 Khordad 
(23 
May) issue, noted that the Iran Accounting Court confirmed these 
figures. 
  The expert from the Majles Accounting Court, Budget and 
Financial Affairs Commission said that the steel factories are 
not profitable and do not give an appropriate return. In 
addition to the fact that the domestic steel market has been 
saturated, international competition is very difficult for 
Iran's steel and thus the Islamic Republic of Iran has not been 
successful exporting its products. He cited the high finished 
price of Iran's steel as one of the reasons for its lack of 
export success. 
  Recently the executive director of the Mobarakeh Steel 
Complex, in an interview with the newspaper RESALAT, called 
himself "God's replacement on earth" and said that with regard 
to his specialty, in one sense his position is higher than that 
of the vice regent and even the Prophet!

  [Text] If approved by the Majles, telephone rates will 
increase. This is the good news that Seyyed Mohammad Gharazi, 
the Islamic Republic's minister of post, telegraph and 
telephone, gave in a speech on the occasion of World 
Communications Day for the information of those present and 
journalists (telephone rates for calling outside the country 
also increased recently). 
  Gharazi said: Based on a bill, which has been presented to 
the Majles, telephone fees, depending on how large or small the 
city, will increase between 2 rials [R] and R4 per pulse. 
  He also promised that by the end of this year [20 March 
1995] 
the delivery of telephones to applicants will take a day or a 
month at the most. 
  In justifying the huge increase in postal rates, the Islamic 
Republic's minister of post, telegraph and telephone said: In 
this area expert work has been under way for five years in the 
Plan and Budget Organization and two years in the General 
Assembly, the Board of Directors and the Council of Ministers, 
and finally this increase in price was approved by the Majles 
along with the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Law. 
  It is necessary to explain that the Majles authorized 
increasing postal costs a maximum of 50 percent, but the 
Ministry of Post, Telegraph and Telephone increased the postal 
rates several times over. 
  Gharazi added: A 50-percent discount has been provided for 
postal services to the press and publications. 
  He said: Production, supplies, and communications equipment 
inside the country have reached a very suitable state, so that 
70 percent of the nation's domestic communications needs are 
being met.

  [Text] A financial protocol to the value of 200 million 
French francs has been ratified today in Paris between the 
Algerian and French Governments. The protocol was signed for 
the Algerian side by the director general of foreign financial 
relations at the Ministry of Finance. 
  This agreement would allow Algerian operators to obtain 
French-made pharmaceutical products for a period of three years. 
This agreement acquires a special significance because it comes 
at a time when Algeria is preparing itself for starting talks at 
the beginning of June with the Paris Club on rescheduling its 
general debts.

<F P=106> [Article: "Algeria-Portugal Gas Sales Accord Signed"] </F>
  [Text] The general manager of Sonatrach [National Company 
for the Transport and Marketing of Hydrocarbons], Mr. Abdelhak 
Bouhafs, has every reason to feel satisfied. Yesterday morning, 
when he joined his Portuguese counterpart, Mr. Elia da Costa, 
president of Portugal's Transgas consortium, in signing the 
contract to sell Algerian natural gas to Portugal, he "clinched" 
two of Sonatrach's major objectives. 
  The contract signed yesterday provides for delivery of 2.5 
billion cubic meters [m[.sup]3[/]] of natural gas to Portugal 
over a 24-year period beginning third quarter 1996. The accord 
is a follow-on to the draft accord signed by Sonatrach and the 
Portuguese Government on 1 July 1993. With this accord, 
Sonatrach will have found buyers for all the natural gas it can 
produce, thus meeting its goal of doubling natural gas exports 
by 1996. Sonatrach now has firm contracts with commercial 
partners to sell 58 billion m[.sup]3[/] of gas beginning in 
1996, compared to current sales of 30 billion. 
  Yesterday's accord was the final document to be initialed 
before moving ahead with construction of the great 
Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline project (GME), which will transport 
Algerian natural gas to Morocco, Spain, and Portugal starting 
sometime in the second half of 1996. With the signing last 
Thursday of two $200-million agreements between Sonatrach and 
two U.S. banks, Eximbank and City Bank, to finance the Algerian 
segment of the GME, the last hurdle standing in the way of the 
project has been overcome. 
  The satisfaction of Sonatrach executives was clearly visible 
yesterday at the Djenane El-Mithak residence where the contract 
was signed, all the more since they had been subjected to 
violent media attacks, in several European (and even American) 
publications, aimed at discrediting Sonatrach and obstructing 
realization of the project. The general idea propagated in this 
denigration campaign was that in the current political and 
security environment, there is no guarantee Algeria will be a 
safe and reliable supplier for its clients, or that adequate 
security be provided for foreign technicians coming to Algeria 
for the construction phase of the pipeline project. 
  The strong commitments made by the Algerian Government 
finally won over the Bechtel company (United States)--which is 
supposed to build the Algerian segment of the GME--Eximbank, 
City Bank, and ultimately the Portuguese buyer. 
  Sonatrach executives also have every reason to be pleased 
with the Portuguese Government's decision to allow Sonatrach to 
acquire a partnership interest in Transgas, the consortium that 
will operate the Portuguese natural gas distribution system. In 
brief remarks to journalists yesterday after the signing 
ceremony, Mr. da Costa confirmed Sonatrach's capital 
participation in Transgas, predicting the consortium will 
benefit from Sonatrach's know-how in the natural gas domain. 
  The fact that negotiations between Sonatrach and the 
Portuguese authorities unfolded "in an almost unprecedented 
spirit of cooperation and dialogue," as Mr. da Costa termed it 
yesterday, was doubtless partly responsible for Sonatrach being 
the first foreign partner chosen to participate in the capital 
of the Portuguese consortium. Portuguese interests control 51 
percent of Transgas's capital, which is also open to other 
foreign companies.

<F P=106> [Article by Ghania Oukazi: "Consequences of Dinar's </F>
Devaluation"] 
  [Text] The recent devaluation of the dinar has had a mixed 
reception from public-sector employers, some believing it will 
stimulate domestic economic activity... 
  This view was expressed by Mr. Mustapha Mekkideche, 
president 
of the Exporters Club, who believes the currency devaluation 
will stimulate exports dramatically and trigger a wave of new 
investment. 
  Also, he believes it would be wise to draw up an action 
program to stabilize economic conditions and thus curb 
inflationary trends. In addition, Mr. Mekkideche believes it 
important to implement companion measures to keep key 
macroeconomic variables in balance. 
  However, he concedes exporters will have to pay more for raw 
materials--which means, in his opinion, there will be 
substantial foreign exchange losses, which the state is not 
prepared to offset. The export spokesman noted that enterprises 
in the sector will have difficulty obtaining credit. All 
evidence to date suggests this will slow down many of their 
activities. 
  Mr. Mekkideche also thinks that to derive full benefit from 
the devaluation, it is important not to raise workers' wage 
scales. Moreover, exporters hope to see rapid implementation of 
a scheme to insure them against foreign exchange losses. 
  The president of the exporters' group emphasized that the 
accord between Algeria and the IMF is broadly satisfactory, in 
that hydrocarbon losses will be offset. That being the case, Mr. 
Mekkideche concludes by voicing the hope that the financial 
infusions will not be used to finance nonproductive activity or 
reestablish an economy based on state investment. 
  Meanwhile, the UNEP [National Union of Public Entrepreneurs] 
said through spokesperson Ahmed Benyounes that the recent 
devaluation of the dinar came as no surprise, although it seemed 
somewhat larger than necessary. 
  According to Mr. Benyounes, devaluation will only aggravate 
the state's already serious liquidity problems. For example, he 
says the attendant increase in cost of raw materials will block 
further progress in many initiatives. 
  Even so, Mr. Benyounes remains optimistic and noted the 
positive effects of the devaluation. He believes, for instance, 
that it will facilitate Algeria's integration into the 
international marketplace. 
  However, he maintains that rigorous management of resources 
is essential for national economic recovery. 
  UNEP also appealed for broader consultations between the 
social partners to increase administrative efficiency at the 
local level and fully implement the increasingly vital 
industrial restructuring. 
  ADEM [The National Employment Agency] for its part believes 
that to avoid loss of valuable time--since freeing up prices 
charged by monopolies that have not yet been restructured could 
lead to a social explosion--the government needs to demonstrate 
its commitment to change by moving quickly from a statist system 
based on investment in public-sector monopolies to a competitive 
market economy that will stimulate creativity by recognizing 
labor's real value in our society. 
  During the standby or observation period, Algeria must 
implement a stabilization policy to resorb the excess money in 
the economy by putting an end to excessive public-sector 
outlays, a courageous solution to the stupendous deficits of 
public-sector enterprises. 
  While at the same time implementing far-reaching structural 
reforms in every domain: administration, customs, tax policy, 
and banking, to name only a few. 
  The state, during this transition period, has an important 
stabilizing role to play, harmonizing economic efficiency with 
social cohesion and working to make the social safety net more 
effective in the fight against exclusion and poverty. 
  But the most effective social protection is renewed 
investment. This in turn will require establishing a national 
clearinghouse to prevent the combination of an activist monetary 
policy and a selective budgetary policy from leading to 
blockages in the economy. The clearinghouse should be part of a 
strategy that is clearly defined over time, adapting tactics to 
the strategic objective of increasing collective prosperity.

<F P=106> [Article by Samir Knayaz: "450 Private Companies Left </F>
Dangling"] 
  [Text] To gain access to new lines of credit for financing 
imports, companies must show they are financially sound... 
  This is one of the most important conditions contained in 
the 
10 import-financing measures that went into effect upon the 
dissolution of the Ad Hoc Committee. But it turns out that at 
least 450 private enterprises, despite the fact they are 
investing in so-called priority sectors or import substitution, 
will not be able to benefit from these finance modalities. As 
things stand now, they find themselves seriously indebted due to 
foreign exchange losses occasioned by the devaluation of the 
dinar. 
  Exchange losses result from fluctuations in the value of the 
national currency against hard currencies. In the case of 
Algeria, the problem for private enterprises first arose in 
1991, when the government of Mr. Mouloud Hamrouche devalued the 
dinar, and no concrete solution has yet been found. The results 
have been catastrophic for private-sector enterprises, since 
they have been obliged to pay back three, four, even five times 
the amount of loans extended to them. The situation has been 
such that a number of companies filed bankruptcy. Public-sector 
enterprises, though hit equally hard by the problem, were given 
more support. 
  Several tens of billions of dinars were injected into them 
to 
make up for their losses, while nothing was done to cushion the 
shock for those in the private sector. 
  This dichotomy--which national authorities deny but that is 
nonetheless a reality--has aroused the wrath of private 
investors. 
  With the installation of Mr. Ghozali as head of government 
to 
replace Mr. Hamrouche, private entrepreneurs began to hope for a 
final resolution of the question. Mr. Ghozali had promised to 
deal with the issue by instituting the famous tripartite 
commission (government-National Union of Algerian 
Workers-employers). But things dragged on, and the problem was 
left hanging. 
  Mr. Belaid Abdesselam, Ghozali's successor, made a similar 
promise on 6 February 1993 in a meeting with employer 
representatives. 
  But while exchange losses of statal enterprises were 
completely resorbed as part of public-sector financial reform, 
the estimated 3 billion dinars in losses sustained by the 
private enterprises was ignored. In late 1993 another head of 
government, Mr. Redha Malek, proposed a "solution" that in fact 
would have served only to aggravate matters and bury private 
enterprises deeper in debt: a rescheduling of debt service over 
a 7-year period with interest set at 11.5 percent. 
  This solution was never implemented, though, since the 
companies concerned rejected it. So four governments have come 
and gone while the exchange rate problem remains. Why? The CAP 
[Algerian Employers Confederation] monitoring committee, which 
was instituted recently to find a solution to the problem and 
met yesterday at the Hotel Aurassi, says quite simply: "There is 
a calculated campaign to destroy the private manufacturing 
sector. It would take only a single decision to save it, as was 
the case with our Tunisian and Moroccan neighbors, but it seems 
no one wants to do so. Paralyzing the private sector means 
paralyzing the country's progress toward economic opening, 
something that some decisionmakers do not want." The committee, 
which represents about 450 enterprises employing 20,000-25,000 
workers, is calling once again on authorities to come up with a 
formula that would permit all economic operators to integrate 
exchange risk into their production and investment decisions. 
  In that context, the committee is asking for an 
unconditional 
payoff of the exchange losses, with the resulting obligations to 
be rescheduled through primary banks at concessional interest 
rates. 
  Will their appeal will heard this time? Will the issue at 
last be resolved? At this point, it is up to the government of 
Mr. Sifi to answer such questions, for the future of several 
hundred enterprises and several thousand employees is at stake. 
Another issue up for decision is whether to end once and for all 
the public-private-sector dichotomy that has become an integral 
part of our economic system.

  [Text] The current year's supplementary financial law, 
endorsed by the Council of Ministers last Monday, anticipates 
overall revenues of about 474.1 billion Algerian dinars against 
expenditures amounting to about 613.7 billion dinars--that is, 
an estimated deficit amounting to 139.6 billion Algerian dinars. 
  In comparison with the original financial law, the sources 
of 
the overall budget have risen by 15.6 percent and the 
expenditures by 14.6 percent. The budget's overall level has 
risen from 125.3 billion dinars to 139.6 billion Algerian dinars.

<F P=106> [Article: "Industrial Restructuring"] </F>
  [Text] "Privatization, meaning the total transfer of state 
ownership, is not what we have in mind at the moment." 
  The author of this statement is the minister for industrial 
restructuring and participation, Mr. Mourad Benachenhou. 
[sentence as published] 
  He also told CHAINE III that he did not consider himself the 
minister for privatization. More specifically, Mr. Benachenhou 
said his ministry's mission is not privatization but rather 
redesign: to analyze the current state of the industrial plant 
and other economic activities and propose a reorganization to 
facilitate increased productivity. 
  The minister added that his department has no intention of 
drawing up a reorganization policy in a vacuum. Quite the 
opposite: He envisages consulting all parties concerned, 
including the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers]. "The 
ministry will elaborate a policy that will have greater impact 
on the Algerian economic landscape and on all the social 
partners, who are extremely important, since they represent the 
great mass of workers. The latter will be consulted and have the 
opportunity to express their views about reorganization of the 
industrial plant." The minister noted that the objective of 
restructuring the economy is to increase the productivity of the 
industrial plant, whether it be publicly or privately owned. 
  "We must recognize that the industrial sector needs 
reorganization to increase productivity and modernize the 
productive plant. It is growth of the existing plant, quite 
apart from the question of its ownership, that will ensure a 
return to economic growth, create jobs, and stabilize the value 
of the dinar," said Mr. Benachenhou. According to the minister, 
two factors must be considered in reorganizing the sector. 
First, existing productive potential must be maintained. 
"Deindustrialization under the cover of restructuring is out of 
the question." Second, reorganization must reinforce employment, 
not lead to its disappearance. 
  At the time Mr. Benachenhou was installed in his new 
position, he said among other things that there was a need to 
come up with industrial restructuring options compatible with 
Algerian realities. The secretary general of the UGTA has 
proposed that priority go to creating employee shareholderships. 
  Regarding the effects of the IMF accord on economic 
recovery, 
the minister said Algeria has the resources to recover if it 
meticulously implements the IMF stabilization policy. Even a 
simple debt rescheduling would be enough to put Algeria on the 
road to economic recovery, if the rescheduling covers a long 
enough period to allow for consolidation. 
  The negotiations expected to begin in the next few weeks 
with 
the Paris Club on rescheduling medium and long-term official 
debt could lead to a $4 billion reduction in debt service for 
1994 and an additional $1 billion reduction between now and the 
March 1995 expiration of the standby agreement; without such 
relief, it is estimated that debt service for the current year 
would amount to $9.5 billion. 
  Referring to the secrecy surrounding the contents of the 
letter of intent sent to the IMF--some of the social partners 
seem to be critical of the government on this score--the 
minister said the letter contained "a number of measures whose 
effectiveness cannot be assured unless they remain confidential 
until implemented." 
  "The contents of the accord will only be made public," Mr. 
Benachenhou added, "insofar as it is determined that disclosure 
would not prejudice national interests or be exploited by a 
minority for purposes of profit." 
  "It is a question of collective responsibility," he 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Diabali: "Annaba: When the Fabric of the </F>
Economy Unravels..."] 
  [Text] Oran--Annaba, one of the country's most important 
economic development hubs, is on the verge of foundering. The 
steelworking capital is leaking at every seam, as indeed it 
should be, since a large number of enterprises, having taken on 
too much debt, have gone under. 
  The consequences of a decade of extreme mismanagement are 
going to end up destroying the last vestiges of its economic 
potential. One by one, wilaya-owned, parastatal, and state-owned 
enterprises have been shaken by labor crises that have seriously 
compromised their future, means of production have been 
sabotaged or shut down for diverse reasons, bank accounts have 
been blocked, and equipment has been sold off cheap to local or 
foreign buyers. 
  Enterprises like Ferrovial, Real-Sider, Enriest, Ferphos, 
Ecotec, Enafroid, and many others are begging the banks for 
money to pay workers' wages and desperately seeking even the 
smallest contract to write into their almost empty order books. 
  The two state-owned companies, Asmidal and Sider, are in a 
tight corner. The first, operating in the red, financially 
unhinged, and burdened by a swollen personnel roster, survives 
only by tapping the public treasury. The second, a veritable 
monster of heavy industry, manages somehow to limp along with 
its decrepit equipment and 50 percent manpower excess, reeling 
under the weight of utopian projects. The Bellar project (Jijel) 
is probably typical: Although the project seemed feasible in the 
1980's, what was supposed to become Algeria's second-largest 
steelworking complex has been abandoned to its fate after tens 
of billions of dinars were plowed into it. 
<H5>  Corruption, Malfeasance </H5>
  Beyond the economic recession that is generally blamed for 
the current situation, one must consider the fact that some of 
the enterprises implanted or represented in the wilaya of Annaba 
have been weakened by poor business management, embezzlement, 
and other sorts of malfeasance that have ended up in the courts 
(Edimco, Orelait, Emifor, Sidal, Asmidal), or stirred up 
scandals in APCs [people's communal assemblies], technical 
agencies, the customs service, banks, etc., altogether depriving 
public coffers of billions in revenue. 
  The two largest scandals to date, the container scandal at 
the port of Annaba--still a murky affair--and Orelait Annaba's 
importation of date-expired powdered milk and palm oil, are very 
significant in terms of the way they were handled. Whereas the 
former scandal is still in the courts, no one--neither the 
participation fund, nor the board of directors, nor the state as 
principal shareholder--has demanded that Orelait account for 
this palm oil, which was too old to sell only a few months after 
being unloaded at the port of Annaba. 
  Annaba has certainly seen a record number of corruption and 
malfeasance scandals. The ceramics and wood for the 19 May 
stadium complex, the concrete benches now adorning villas in 
Chrea, near Blida, the large quantity of cement originally 
destined for Maquam Echahid for the Seraidi road and diverted to 
the construction of "si flen" [as published]: Resource 
diversions and abuses of power were an everyday reality between 
1985 and 1990, but the perpetrators have never been "punished." 
  In 1994, in addition to business failures and bankruptcies 
(due in part to poor management), arson has gutted the plants of 
socioeconomic units such as Enatb, Ecotec, the Civil Protection 
Unit of Drean, the Annaba APC, EPEA [expansion not given], 
Sonelgaz, ENATB [expansion not given] and Ecotec at Oued Zied. 
  As if that were not enough, the future of other units has 
been thrown into serious doubt by labor conflict, sometimes 
latent but in other cases flaring into open confrontation--for 
example, at National Highway Transport Company/Chaiba, where 
workers have been on strike since 5 April, and Hydro-Transfert, 
where tools were downed on 10 April.

<F P=106> [Article: "Oum El-Bouaghi: Specter of Unemployment"] </F>
  [Text] What sort of employment policy is needed when 78.57 
percent of job seekers are between the ages of 16 and 30? 
  The population of the wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is close to 
500,000, and the growth rate is 3.06 percent, which far 
outstrips the national rate (2.72 percent). As of 1993, the 
labor pool was about 111,380 (including active job seekers), 
which means actual jobholders in the various sectors number only 
85,844. 
  The number of unemployed in the wilaya is 25,496 (official 
figure), which means an unemployment rate of 22.08 by 
conventional calculations; it also means that 5.27 percent of 
the total population of the wilaya are without jobs, and only 
one out of every 6 people is working, so the dependency ratio is 
6 to 1. 
  According to the manpower office, there are 1,890 persons 
seeking jobs. This figure breaks down by dairas as follows: 810 
people in the daira of Ain Beida, 283 in Meskiana, 452 in Ain 
M'lila, 385 in Oum El-Bouaghi (we note that the highest figure 
is for Ain Beida, which is not realistic). 
  The actual number of job seekers is much greater. For 
example, the number of youths dropped from the 3 AS high-school 
rolls is 2,029--all of them good prospects for joblessness. 
Young people aged 16-30 account for 78.57 percent of the 
unemployment (a veritable social disaster, compared to other 
wilayas in the country). 
  The job market for the entire wilaya of Oum El-Bouaghi is 
about 43,000, a figure that reflects the nonexistence of statal 
or private productive investment, as well as the almost total 
absence of employment policy at the governmental or wilaya level. 
  The supply of unfilled jobs breaks down by daira as follows: 
182 for Ain Beida, 96 for Meskiana, 109 for Ain M'lila, 87 for 
Oum El-Bouaghi. Is this enough to resorb all the unemployment in 
the wilaya? Sectorally, employment in the wilaya breaks down as 
follows: 26,750 jobs in agriculture (31.14 percent), 11,256 in 
construction and water works (13.10 percent), 7,282 in industry 
(8.47 percent, which reflects the weakness of the industrial 
sector and its marginality), and 40,596 in the tertiary sector 
(which does not create jobs and economic growth). 
Administration, commerce, and services account for 47.26 percent 
of employment. These figures suggest there is a total lack of 
industrial investments to remedy the unemployment problem. 
  In the face of these statistics, would it not be a good time 
to give new impetus to agriculture and construction, the biggest 
users of manpower? Recovery in these two sectors could alleviate 
unemployment at least to some extent. 
  "You cannot talk philosophy with starving people. We want 
something concrete," quipped one unemployed youth. An outburst 
that captures well the current attitudes of youth.

  [Text] The Honorable Dr. R. Nedunchezian, minister of 
finance, government of Tamil Nadu, presented the budget for 
1994/95 in the Legislative Assembly and delivered the following 
speech: 
  1. The Honorable Speaker: 
  I take great pride and pleasure in placing before the 
Assembly for its approval revised estimates for 1993/94 and the 
budget for 1994/95. 
  "That leader who has these four qualities--munificence, 
gracefulness, justice, and care of the people--is a light among 
the rulers," said Saint Tiruvalluvar. The Honorable Chief 
Minister, the revolutionary, Dr. J. Jayalalitha embodying these 
qualities, has striven tirelessly to give this state an 
excellent administration. 
  2. As per Tiruvalluvar's definition of a good ruler, the 
Chief Minister Dr. Jayalalitha gives donations and welfare aid 
to the poor people, responds positively to people who seek help, 
rules in a fair and just manner, and gives protection to the 
underprivileged masses, thus working in an admirable way. All 
impartial observers are aware of this fact. 
  With such fine characteristics of a good ruler the Honorable 
Dr. J. Jayalalitha strives to fairly administer the state, and 
the people of Tamil Nadu have always given her their 
wholehearted support. The state under the leadership of Dr. 
Jayalalitha is firmly committed to adhering to the basics of the 
policy and ideals of our great scholar C.N. Annadurai and the 
constructive programs with full compassion for the masses 
initiated by our great leader M.G. Ramachandran. 
  3. Tamil Nadu stands out as an exceptionally successful 
state, maintaining peace, law, order, and unity, while at the 
same time achieving rapid all-around economic development. There 
is basic assurance and maintenance of law and order. The threat 
posed by foreign militants and extremists has been rooted out. 
No disruptive force has been allowed to rear its ugly head. 
Tamil Nadu today stands out in India as an oasis of peace and 
harmony, and this wholesome situation has enabled it to march 
forward with strident steps. 
  4. The honorable members are well aware of the grave 
economic 
crisis of 1991. It was during this unprecedented economic crisis 
that the Honorable J. Jayalalitha came to head the 
administration of the state. The new economic policy enunciated 
by the Center in the wake of this major economic crisis 
incorporates some basic policies of stabilization and structural 
adjustment. It has also envisaged a new long-term view of 
economic growth. We share the same vision of prosperity and 
rapid economic growth. It is imbued with this vision that we 
endorse the policy to integrate the Indian economy with the 
global economy, secure a quantum increase in investment to 
promote employment, and create a liberalized environment, 
facilitating the growth progress. At the same time, we have been 
most concerned about the situation of the poor and 
underprivileged people in the wake of the stabilization and 
structural adjustment processes. Whenever she speaks at the 
regional or national conferences, our chief minister the 
Honorable Dr. J. Jayalalitha pleads vigorously for great care in 
implementing any policy that affects the poor. The Center's 
recent increase in prices on various items like rice, diesel, 
and LPG [liquified petroleum gas], etc., in the public 
distribution system, and the increase of railway freight rates 
on coal have put the states in a difficult situation. Our 
administration has endeavored to protect the poor and 
underpriviliged people from the ill-effects of this price 
increase. 
  5. Despite an extremely difficult financial situation, the 
rice distribution subsidy, which was Rs [Rupees] 105 crore was 
stepped up to Rs400 crore in 1993/94. As the Central Government 
has raised the procurement price of rice intended for public 
distribution, to be effective from February, the state 
government was left with no other option but to raise the price 
of rice also. Hence, the subsidy climbed up to Rs440 crore in 
1993/94. In addition, in 1994/95 a provision of Rs75 crore has 
been made to discharge the arrears that have accumulated. The 
total subsidy for 1994/95 is thus Rs515 crore, which is the 
highest provision ever made. It will be clear that this 
government has done its utmost to protect the poor from the 
immediate effects of the increase in rice prices announced by 
the Center. 
  6. It is absolutely essential to keep a close watch on 
prices, particularly on the basket of commodities consumed by 
the poor. The Center will have to exercise utmost vigilence in 
controlling the rate of inflation. The fiscal deficit in 1993/94 
and the position anticipated do lend cause for concern that 
price increases may again pose problems. The instruments of 
macro-economic management are wholly with the Center, and even 
as steps are taken to stimulate the economy, we urge the Center 
to take appropriate measures to hold the prices in check. 
  7. It has always been our stand, consistent with the 
philosophy of a strong union of prosperous and autonomous 
states, that the Constitution needs to be changed to ensure that 
the Center have all the powers to protect and safeguard the 
sovereignty of the nation, while the states have the powers and 
responsibilities for growth and welfare. We shall continue to 
reiterate this stand. Recent economic trends confirm this 
perception of the relative roles of the Center and the states. 
  8. We are keen that the Center-state fiscal relations be 
anchored on sound principles of a matching resource base and 
duties. In the context of the new economic policy, there has 
been a decisive shift in the functions of the government with a 
clear tilt toward the social sectors. Conventionally, the states 
have had a much larger role to play in the social sectors. While 
the Central initiatives in deciding the national goal and the 
way we achieve these goals are always welcome, it is essential 
that the states have adequate resources to deal with the needs 
of these sectors on their own. It is in this context that the 
honorable chief minister has pleaded forcefully that the states 
be empowered with adequate inflows to undertake such programs on 
their own. It is not appropriate to introduce new 
Centrally-sponsored schemes in the garb of externally aided 
projects. It is best that states be assured of getting resources 
to handle the needs of these sectors on their own. 
  9. Recent trends in the Center-state resource allocations 
leave us quite concerned. We are greatly affected by the slow 
down in the growth of Central excise duties, the mainstay of 
resource allocations, as recommended by the Finance Commission. 
We are also concerned that the tax potential under the Income 
Tax Act has not been fully realized. This situation has come 
about after the states' percentage share of both income tax and 
excise duties has remained stagnant for a decade. This indeed is 
a worrisome situation. This highlights the need to immediately 
take up the question of assigning to the states a share in the 
corporation tax. This has been a longstanding demand of the 
states. The Sakaria Commission on Center-state relations has 
clearly recommended that the corporation tax be shared with the 
states. Successive finance commissions have also seen the merit 
in the states' argument, but have been unable to move forward 
without any specific indication in their term of reference. With 
de-licensing, de-control, and liberalized systems, states are 
being informed that they will have to act quickly to upgrade the 
infrastructure and provide the necessary support for industry to 
move ahead. It is all the more relevant that a share of the 
corporation tax be made available to the states at this 
juncture. We do hope that the Center will make specific 
reference to the 10th Finance Commission even at this late stage 
on the question of sharing the corporation tax with the states. 
  10. We are also deeply concerned about the situation 
relating 
to the levying of the consignment tax. In our view not levying 
this tax leads to a considerable amount of evasion of the sales 
tax. The chief minister in December 1993 brought this up during 
her meeting with the vice chairman of the Planning Commission. 
She expressed her view that it would not be appropriate to 
reconsider the decision made at the chief ministers' conference 
under the chairmanship of the late Rajiv Gandhi. It is not right 
to link the levying of the consignment tax with other questions 
relating to interstate trade. The unanimous decision already 
made on the issue of levying the consignment tax needs to be 
implemented immediately. We would once again urge the Center to 
bring forward necessary legislation in the current session of 
the Assembly for the levying of the consignment tax. 
  11. In a rapidly growing economy, it is a well-known 
phenomenon that the services sector's relative share will 
increase and the growth of the interest rate is usually high in 
the services sector. The Indian economy is no different. While 
raising resources to finance plans, programs, and essential 
activities of the government, it is important that the service 
sector also be tapped. While welcoming the new direction in the 
Central budget for 1994/95 toward taxing the service sector, we 
are concerned that this tax is to be levied, collected, and 
wholly appropriated by the Center. We are of the view that this 
is not in harmony with the spirit of the Constitution. The 
Constitution gives the states the right to impose taxes on the 
sale or purchase of goods. It should thus be clear that the 
power to levy and collect taxes on services should be with the 
states. No doubt reliance could be placed on the residual entry 
in the union list, but this would not be a logical construction 
given the nature of the sale of services. In a study entrusted 
to the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, the 
question of taxation on services has been studied in depth and 
the states have stressed the view that taxes similar to the 
central sales tax could be collected and retained by the states. 
In the long run, in financial services, etc., where uniformity 
of taxation is necessary, these could be under a Central tax. 
Suitable constitutional amendments are necessary to bring about 
these changes. Even as the matter is under consideration, we are 
concerned that the Center will levy taxes on certain services 
and fully appropriate the revenue. We are hopeful that the whole 
issue will be discussed in the right perspective. We are also 
deeply concerned that the Center is unmindful of the states' 
static resource base and is engaging in its drive to enlarge its 
resource base. A share in the tax on the service sector cannot 
be denied to the states, when they have contributed more than 40 
percent to the GNP. 
  12. The honorable members of this Assembly are aware that 
the 
10th Finance Commission is to submit its report before June 
1994. As desired by the Commission, we have submitted detailed 
reports, estimates, etc. The Commission is likely to hold its 
session in Madras in April 1994. It has a crucial role to play 
in view of the vast changes that have occurred in the resource 
base available to the Center and the states, and their relative 
roles. We have noticed two pronounced shifts taking place in the 
fiscal scenario. First, we are greatly concerned by the lack of 
buoyancy in the growth of Central tax revenues relevant to the 
states, namely in the growth of basic excise duties and the 
delay in realizing the full potential under the Income Tax Act. 
Second, there has been a marked and decided shift in favor of 
the states with regard to the responsibilities expected to be 
discharged by them. This is with particular reference to the 
enhanced role of the government in the social sector, and the 
increasing role of the private sector in areas earlier reserved 
for the public sector. It is thus seen that these trends have 
accentuated the fiscal difficulties faced by the states. We have 
presented our forecast to the 10th Finance Commission and will 
reiterate it when the Commission visits the state. It is 
relevant to highlight the fact that the states are facing an 
unenviable situation. 
  On the one hand, the rapid increase in prices of various 
commodities administered by the Center and the general rate of 
inflation caused by the national economic crisis have put 
tremendous pressure on the state's ability to contain 
expenditure growth. On the other hand, the states increasingly 
find it difficult to mobilize additional resources from the 
conventional resource base allotted to them. The net result has 
been an extremely difficult financial situation for the states. 
Any plan to contain expenditure can only be implemented in the 
interim. It is essential that, in the transfer of resources 
between the Center and the states in the revised fiscal 
scenario, a forward looking scheme of rescuing the states from 
the financial crisis be developed by the 10th Finance Commission. 
  13. In particular, we have been greatly distressed by the 
recommendations of the Ninth Finance Commission, as adopted and 
implemented. The recommendations proved to be most disappointing 
for Tamil Nadu. It assessed Tamil Nadu as a state with surplus 
income in the non-plan revenue account, but the actual position 
has turned out to be one of large deficits. It has maintained 
the share for all the states at the state level of 45 percent in 
basic excise duties. Worse still, the effective share of all 
states excluding the earmarked share of deficit states, has 
really gone down from 40 percent to 37.53 percent. 
  Third, in its projections, the Finance Commission has 
assumed 
a low inflation rate, whereas, the actual experience has been 
totally contrary. In addition, Tamil Nadu has also suffered due 
to the wrong estimation of surplus income and thereby a denial 
of a substantial amount of planned revenue-grant. We eagerly 
anticipate that the 10th Finance Commission, with its term of 
reference, will render justice to the states. The fiscal 
situation confronting all the states in the wake of the 
recommendations of the Ninth Finance Commission is extremely 
troublesome. Only a fresh view of the scheme of resource 
allocation to the states can rescue the states from their 
plight. We hope the 10th Finance Commission will break new 
ground in developing a resource-transfer scheme that will lead 
states confidently into the 21st century. 
<H5>  The Annual Plan </H5>
  14. The honorable members are well aware that our 
revolutionary leader has demonstrated that every year we have 
been achieving a lot more than the goals adopted under the 
approved outlay in the annual plan. We have achieved more than 
what other plans with higher outlays have achieved. The measu re 
of achievement is indeed praiseworthy. In the year 1992/93 among 
the 15 non-special category of states, eight could not complete 
the plan's outlay. Tamil Nadu stands out as one of the states 
that not only completed the approved plan outlay of Rs1,766 
crore for 1992/93, but went on to identify additional areas of 
need and actually perform an outlay of Rs 1,935 crore, an excess 
of Rs169 crore over the outlay. This singular fact will 
demonstrate our ability to implement plans and programs for the 
maximum benefit of the people. 
  15. For the year 1993/94, we are confident that the approved 
plan outlay of Rs2,101 crore will be achieved. In fact, the 
revised estimates for 1993/94 now provide for a total outlay of 
Rs2,140.30 crore. It is this record of performance that has 
enabled the Union Planning Commission to approve for Tamil Nadu 
a significantly higher plan outlay of Rs2,750 crore for 1994/95. 
This is a step up over the 1993/94 outlay. The honorable Dr. J. 
Jayalalitha has secured for our state a higher plan outlay, and 
this has enabled us to march forward with confidence to 
implement a good plan of programs and effective services to 
benefit the masses. Under the administration of our 
revolutionary leader, the per capita plan outlay of Tamil Nadu 
in 1994/95 of Rs492.30 will be considerably higher than the 
national per capita plan outlay of Rs433.20. It is an 
extraordinary achievement that this government, despite severe 
financial difficulties, has stepped up investment through good 
planning from a situation much below the national average to a 
position of strength that is significantly higher than the 
national average. It is no exaggeration to say that Tamil Nadu 
has now moved into a higher growth trajectory through systematic 
attention to planned development. It is a record that we have to 
protect with great care and caution, even if some sacrifices are 
involved. We have to inevitably prune some lower priority 
expenditures to find the resources to finance the plan outlay. I 
request that the honorable members of the Assembly bear in mind 
this central theme. 
<H5>  The Police Department </H5>
  16. Our chief minister the honorable Dr. J. Jayalalitha has 
taken measures to make our State Police Department work 
efficiently and with compassion, and for this the members of the 
Assembly will applaud her wholeheartedly. It is a matter of 
utmost satisfaction that the state police is functioning with a 
new sense of vision and direction. Minor situations that have 
risen have been handled most competently. Peace and 
tranquillity, which constitute the bedrock of growth in the 
state, have been ensured. 
  17. The budget includes a total provision of Rs307.19 crore 
for the police force in 1994/95 as against Rs320.13 crore in 
1993/94. Despite fiscal difficulties, this government has tried 
to provide maximum resources to enable the police force to be 
modernized. At one stage the Union home minister gave assurances 
that an additional amount of Rs30 crore would be sanctioned. 
This amount has not yet been released. We would urge the 
Government of India to provide at least this amount in 1994/95. 
We have also submitted a separate plan for a coastal security 
force estimated to cost Rs12 crore. We urge the Government of 
India to accord early approval for the plan and extend necessary 
assistance. 
  18. An expense of Rs10 crore has been incurred in 1993/94 
under the state scheme of modernizing the police force. This 
amount has been used to provide 237 police stations with jeeps, 
raising in some cases from one to two battalions, provision of 
arms and ammunition, as well as essential infrastructure 
facilities. It has gone a long way in upgrading the capability 
of the state police. We intend to continue the state scheme of 
modernizing the state police in 1994/95. The effort will be to 
completely upgrade the mobility-communications capabilities, 
increase equipment availability, and enhance functioning arms 
and ammunition. No effort will be spared in making the Tamil 
Nadu police the best in the country. 
  19. As a result of various welfare schemes undertaken by the 
state government, the morale of the police has been increased to 
a substantial level. The big scheme to provide housing to the 
police constables has progressed in a notable manner. In 1993/94 
at the cost of Rs12.5 crore, 1,000 houses were built for the 
constables. This is the highest number of houses built in a 
year. The housing project will continue in 1994/95 also. For 
this purpose, a special allocation of Rs5 crore has been made. 
The Uniformed Service Recruitment Board (USRB) has completed the 
planned recruitment of 10,000 new police constables. The newly 
recruited constables have been trained and are now being 
positioned in the field. This has been a significant 
strengthening of the State Police Force and will considerably 
enhance the capabilities of the police force in tackling any 
situation. The USRB is now in the process of completing the 
recruitment of 500 police deputy inspectors. This will further 
strengthen the capability of the State Police Force. 
<H5>  Cyclone and Flood Relief </H5>
  20. Tamil Nadu has been repeatedly battered by severe 
cyclones, storms, and floods. Continuously from 1991 we have had 
to provide massive relief and restoration measures far beyond 
what our financial resources could meet. Every year we have been 
sending detailed reports to the Central Government. Yet the 
financial aid came only under interim relief funds. This was not 
adequate for the purpose. 
  So we had to spend a substantial amount in addition to the 
aid given. It is for this reason that we have sent a detailed 
project report with an outlay request for Rs2,560 crore to the 
Government of India to be passed on to the World Bank. The World 
Bank has extended assistance to Andhra Pradesh for a cyclone 
emergency reconstruction project. We also understand that the 
World Bank has recently agreed to extend assistance to the 
government of Maharashtra for reconstruction following the 
earthquake in that state. Tamil Nadu's situation following the 
successive batterings by repeated cyclones is equally serious. 
We are not quite able to perceive why Tamil Nadu's 
reconstruction plan cannot be approved. We do hope the Center 
will prevail upon the World Bank to enable this government to 
take up a proper reconstruction project. 
  21. The recent cyclones and floods in November and December 
1993 have struck different areas and have caused widespread 
damage. We have already sanctioned an expenditure of Rs75.37 
crore for various relief and restoration operations. The 
assistance so far received is Rs29.25 crore including the 
advance release of Rs14.63 crore from the Calamity Relief Fund 
due for the year 1994/95. The World Bank has recently agreed to 
sanction Rs31 crore under the Agricultural Development Project 
to take up flood restoration work. The 10th Finance Commission 
will have to take note of the total inadequacy of the Calamity 
Relief Fund arrangement in the case of Tamil Nadu, and provide 
for a substantially enhanced allocation at least from the year 
1995/96. We have already made detailed submissions in this 
regard to the 10th Finance Commission. We will reiterate this 
when the Commission meets in April in Madras. 
<H5>  Development Schemes </H5>
  22. As we step into the new financial year 1994/95, I 
briefly 
mentioned to you many policy problems that have given cause for 
great concern. Due to want of time, I request that details of 
various schemes and services in part B of my speech kindly be 
taken as read in the Assembly. Part B details the schemes about 
agriculture, food processing, irrigation, village development, 
cattle breeding, fisheries, forestry, industries, fuel sources, 
roads and transportation, environment, Madras metropolitan area, 
housing, education and welfare, drinking water supply, 
well-being of women and children, food and nutrition, welfare of 
the Adi Dravida and Aborigines, labor welfare, loan schemes, 
employment facilities, and the welfare of government workers. 
Among these development schemes, there are some new ones and 
special projects for various sections of the people. The members 
of the Assembly will certainly approve the new efforts detailed 
in the budget. 
  23. The details of these schemes are given in part B of the 
speech, yet I would like to mention a few big schemes and 
services. 

  -  Foodgrains production has been increased to a record level 
of 100 lakh crore tons. The new areas emphasized are increasing 
capital investment in agriculture, emphasis on production of 
high value crops, improvement of irrigation, watershed 
development, wasteland development, and human resources 
development. A new human resources development project at a cost 
of Rs76 crore will be launched in 1994/95. 
  -  The water resources consolidation project with a total outlay 
of Rs952 crore is to be launched in 1994/95, with a budget 
provision of Rs40 crore. This government urges the Government of 
India to implement the Peninsular River water grid and the 
Pamba-Achan Koil-Vaigai link, in particular, at the earliest. A 
major program for standardizing 4,270 temple tanks will be 
continued.

Newsprint and Papers Ltd's expansion plan will be implemented in 
1994/95 with an outlay of Rs200 crore. A new leather industrial 
estate will be established near Madras. 
  -  The highlight of the power situation in Tamil Nadu has been 
the 
absence of any energy cuts. The plan outlay on this sector in 
1994/95 will be Rs625 crore, a 16-percent increase over 1993/94. 
The first stage of the North Madras Thermal Power Project with 
three units of 210 Mw will be completed in 1994/95 and one unit 
will be synchronized with the grid. Work on the Basin Bridge 
gas-based power project with four units of 30 Mw has started. 
The Jayamkondan Integrated Lignite Mining &amp; Power Generation 
Project to generate 1,500 Mw with an investment of Rs7,500 crore 
will be taken up in the associate sector. The memorandum of 
understanding to establish a 100 Mw ocean thermal energy plant 
at a cost of Rs800 crore is a major initiative to attempt to 
harness and utilize a perennially renewable source of energy. 
  -  A substantial increase of 26 percent in the allocation for 
road 
maintenance has been made in 1994/95 over 1993/94. A road sector 
project at a cost of Rs880 crore, has been formulated for World 
Bank financing to completely upgrade the road system in the 
state. In 1994/95, all villages with a population of more than 
1,000 as per the 1981 census will be provided with all-weather 
roads. 
  -  An integrated coastal area development project will be begun

  -  The Madras Vision 2000 plan envisages an investment of 
Rs4,000 
crore in six years to make Madras the favored destination in the 
country. The Metropolitan Infrastructure Development Corporation 
will be established to finance infrastructure development within 
the city. The budget provides Rs15 crore as share capital for 
this corporation to take its total capital base to Rs60 crore. 
  -  "Shelter for all" is the policy of this government. In 
1994/95, 
housing for 125,000 families will be provided through a number 
of schemes. 
  -  The district primary education project will be launched in 
Dharmapuri, Thiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar, 
Villupuram-Ramaswami-Padayachiar, and South Arcot-Vallalar 
districts at a total cost of Rs120 crore over a period of five 
years. 
  -  As already announced, the World Tamil Conference will be held 
at Thanjavur in a grand manner in January 1995. The Thanjavur 
Palace and Thirumalai Nayakkar Mahal at Madurai will be fully 
renovated. 
  -  The legislation to provide for compulsory enrollment and 
retention of children in schools, without penal provisions, will 
be introduced in this session of the Assembly. A new women's 
college will be started at Ramanathapuram in 1994/95. 
  -  Every taluk will be provided with at least one 32-bed 
hospital 
in 1994/95. New pediatric neonatal clinics will be set up in 
each taluk hospital. A World Bank assisted blindness control 
project and AIDS control project will be launched. 
  -  The planned outlay for drinking water supply will be stepped 
up 
to Rs387.72 crore in 1994/95. The budget provides Rs110 crore 
for the New Veeranam project and Rs100 crore for the Krishna 
water supply project. The water supply schemes for Coimbatore, 
Salem, and Madurai will be completed during 1994/95. All 1,239 
habitations who do not have a protected water source will be 
covered in 1994/95, so that there will be no habitation in the 
state that is without a protected source of water. A 
desalination plant of 1 million liters capacity per day is to be 
installed at Narippaiyur in Ramanthapuram District at a cost of 
Rs10.75 crore. 
  -  Two special incentive schemes to promote literacy among 
Scheduled caste female children will be launched. Scheduled 
caste female children in Dharmapuri, 
Thiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar, Villupuram-Ramaswami-Padayachiar, 
and South Arcot-Vallalar districts, who are likely to drop out 
at the end of standard II [second grade] will be given a special 
incentive of Rs500 each on completion of class III, IV and V. 
This scheme will cost Rs1.50 crore. A monthly payment of Rs100 
will be made to all indigent, rural, scheduled caste female 
children entering standard VI during the coming year. This 
scheme will cover 30,000 scheduled caste female children 
throughout the state and cost Rs3 crore. 
  -  The program of Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Finance and 
Development Corporation will be stepped up to Rs13 crore to 
benefit 10,000 persons in 1994/95. A special provision of Rs1 
crore will be made in 1994/95 for the provision of free house 
sites to backward class beneficiaries. 

  In aquaculture, two projects to cover 150 hectares in the 
Palk Bay at a cost of Rs13.88 crore and 50 hectares at 
Tharuvaikulam in V.O. Chidambaranar District at a cost of Rs2,20 
crore will be implemented. 

  -  One lakh women will be assisted in improving their incomes 
through various self-employment schemes in 1994/95. The child 
welfare sub plan, which is the 15-point child welfare program of 
revolutionary leader Dr. Jayalalitha put into action, will be 
implemented in 1994/95 at a cost of Rs697.65 crore. The total 
outlay on the revolutionary leader Dr. M.G. Ramachandran 
nutritious noon meal program will be Rs345.36 crore in 1994/95, 
as against Rs312.42 crore in 1993/94. 
  -  The budget provides for Rs46 crore for the scheme to supply 
free clothing for men and women in 1994/95. The budget also 
provides Rs5 crore for assistance for cooperative spinning 
mills. 
  -  A new scheme for health coverage for unorganized labor will

family distress relief scheme is being enhanced to Rs25 crore to 
cover 50,000 beneficiaries. 
  -  The total outlay on the Jawahar employment schemes in 1994/95 
will be Rs220.59 crore. All the employment programs together 
will generate a record total employment of 10-crore man-days in 
1994/95. 

<H5>  Social Security Scheme for the Poor </H5>
  24. In my last budget speech, I placed before you the 
concept 
of protecting the welfare of poor people--improving their 
standard of living by means of a social security net. In the 
wake of the Center's change in basic policies of stabilization 
and economic structural adjustment policy, this particular plan 
for improving the standard of living of the poor was welcomed by 
the people of the state. Our state under the leadership of the 
Honorable Chief Minister Dr. J. Jayalalitha has been making 
special efforts to improve the standard of living of the poor. 
Due to the difficult economic crisis situation at the national 
level, most of the states have to reduce their allocation of 
funds for the welfare of their people. The Honorable Chief 
Minister Dr. J. Jayalalitha has always emphasized that the 
outlay for the social security scheme, intended to protect the 
poor people and improve their standard of living, should be 
increased. The budget for 1994/95 includes a record provision of 
Rs1,599 crore for the social security net for the poor. 
  25. The social security net for the poor that we have 
organized is a comprehensive safety net encompassing food 
security and nutrition for the aged, expectant mothers, and 
children; primary health care and medical services for the poor; 
universal elementary education; employment programs for the 
poor; essential drinking water; shelter for the homeless; social 
security programs and special programs for the weaker sections. 
  26. The outlay for 1994/95 represents a major step over 
1993/94. The effort of the government is to safeguard the poor 
and improve the quality of their life. A recent study by the 
Reserve Bank of India shows that Tamil Nadu is in the forefront 
in providing the maximum outlay to the social sectors. In 
1993/94 the expenditure on social services in Tamil Nadu was 41 
percent of the total expenditure, one of the highest among the 
non-special category states. We are proud of this record, 
namely, that even as we try to secure higher economic growth in 
the context of the new economic policy, the situation of the 
poor is being constantly monitored and every effort is made to 
improve their standard of living. In continuation of the 
long-term plan initiated by the honorable chief minister, all 
the schemes have greatly contributed to promote amity and good 
relations among the various sections of the people of our state. 
<H5>  Fiscal Position </H5>
  27. I shall now attempt to explain the difficult task of 
finding funds for the various schemes and services highlighted 
and to balance the revenue income and revenue expenditure in the 
budget. Members of this Assembly may recall that at the time 
this administration came into power, there was a grave economic 
crisis; the fiscal situation was near collapse. It was thought 
necessary to reduce the outlays for the plan. We have succeeded 
in achieving fiscal stability and, more importantly, established 
a good track record of exceeding the approved plan outlay both 
in 1991/92 and 1992/93. We are now poised to do so again in 
1994/95. We have set forth an ambitious plan outlay of Rs2,750 
crore in 1994/95. The performance of this enhanced outlay will 
call for considerable ingenuity and finesse. 
<H5>  Budget Estimates </H5>
  28. In 1993/94 the budget estimates revenue receipts total 
was Rs6,989.89 crore and revenue expenditures amounted to 
Rs8,300.87 crore and the total deficit was Rs1,310.98 crore. The 
initial estimated deficit was Rs275 crore. Under all heads of 
debit and credit, the net deficit was Rs359.95 crore. Due to new 
taxes and efforts to effect economy, the anticipated net balance 
was Rs80 crore. Therefore the total deficit, taking into account 
everything, was expected to be Rs555.89 crore. 
  29. Because the deficit was so huge, we had to take many 
steps to prevent any reduction in the planned outlay. In the 
revised estimate for 1993/94, the total income under the revenue 
heading was Rs7,215.13 crore and expenditures were Rs8,407.41 
crore and the final deficit was Rs1,192.28 crore. We have to 
mention that in order to bring under control the continuously 
increasing income deficit, we have to take many steps. Taking 
into account that the final balance at the end of the year 
1992/93 was Rs32 crore and the net total deficit was Rs228.82 
crore at the end of 1993/94, it is expected that the net deficit 
will be Rs196.82 crore. While we allocate funds for the planned 
outlays, we have to mention that we have succeeded in bringing 
down the deficit figure more than expected. 
  30. In the year 1994/95, the budget estimates the revenue 
receipts to be Rs7,844.37 crore; expenditures to be Rs9,083.53 
crore; and the net deficit is expected to be Rs1,239.16 crore. 
The 1994/95 budget estimates that under all account headings, 
the net deficit will be Rs2,021 crore. If we add this to the 
1993/94 revised estimate deficit of Rs196.82 crore at the end of 
1994/95, the total deficit will be Rs398.05 crore. 
  31. To manage the widening income deficit, our practice has 
been to raise loans. This has become a necessity. If we do not 
borrow, we may have to reduce outlays for the welfare plans for 
the poor. Our Honorable Chief Minister Dr. J. Jayalalitha has 
been very firm that under the circumstances, we could allow any 
reduction in the plan outlays. [sentence as published] Therefore 
we have had to resort to borrowing, and these loans have further 
increased our responsibilities. In my last budget speech I 
mentioned the long-term methods of controlling growth of 
expenditure, keeping in mind the non-flexible and meager 
financial resources allowed to the states by the Constitution. 
<H5>  Policy on Expenditure </H5>
  32. "If one person's expenditure does not widen, his income, 
however small it may be, does not matter; that person will not 
be ruined." These are the words of Saint Thirvalluvar. 
  Bearing this advice in mind we have formulated the policy on 
expenditure. We have no doubt that the honorable members of the 
Assembly will give wholehearted support. 
  33. We have implemented the policy on the expenditure report 
I submitted last year. At the same time I want to place before 
you a few details. In Tamil Nadu unplanned revenue expenditure 
during the five-year period ending with 1992/93 was up per year 
on the average of 22.6 percent. At the same time, the state's 
revenue was up by 19.2 percent. This is the main reason for the 
deficit total. This has to be brought under control. It has 
become necessary to explore all the possibilities for 
controlling the rate of expenditure. In this endeavor, the 
honorable members of the Assembly must give their wholehearted 
support to the administration. I am aware it is difficult to 
take meaningful control of expenditure growth. There has been a 
demand for additional funds for various schemes. We have to be 
vigilant in seeing that funds go only to the welfare schemes for 
the poor and to preventing money going to people with less need. 
I have to mention that a few sectors deserve priority in 
connection with the control of expenditure. 
  34. We have to make sure that new ideas on improved 
productivity are introduced in government operations. With a 
view to doing away with unnecessary procedures and to improving 
further effectiveness, we have introduced the "Z" bag [as 
published] system--budgeting from the beginning--to achieve fast 
growth. We adopted a system to stop new appointments at the 
recruitment level itself. This was misunderstood as denial of 
employment opportunities, hence it was withdrawn. Instead, we 
decided that at the needed locations, selected changes should be 
made. In the past five years, the allotted funds for pay, wages, 
and retirement have gone up considerably. In this connection, we 
must remember that we have to take certain corrective action. 
  35. Second, prices have been going up higher and higher, and 
various concessions we give people cost us more. As a result, 
not enough funds are available for development work. Without 
withdrawing these concessions, we should make them available to 
the really needy people. At a time when we do not have resources 
for income, it becomes all the more important that we make sure 
that these concessions do really reach the needy people. We 
propose that extensive research be done to see that the 
concessions really reach the poor people. 
  36. Third, there are expenditures on some government 
services 
that do not give back adequate returns. By charging appropriate 
fees for such services, the government expenditure could be 
reduced. This could be done by charging fees on higher 
education, medical services, and economic services like 
irrigation. Without reducing the allocation for any welfare 
projects for the poor, we will charge an appropriate fee from 
those who can afford to pay. By this action the net total 
expenditure burden will be reduced. We should increase the 
amount of fees and fines that the government collects. A higher 
rate of fees has to be collected for the use of certain 
government lands. We should be careful about increasing the fees 
for government service for those who are not poor. 
  37. Fourth, we have decided to withdraw financial support to 
bridge the losses incurred by the public sector undertakings. In 
the past, disregarding the financial burden to the state, we 
have been giving this support to the public sector undertakings, 
which have been operating at a loss. Due to the government's 
mounting financial burden, we cannot continue this support. With 
a view toward preventing financial loss to the public sector 
undertakings, we already have a turn-around plan. If certain 
public sector undertakings continue to operate at a loss, we 
have taken steps to hand them over to the private sector. 
Bearing in mind all the aspects of the problem, we intend to 
study every case separately. 
  38. Fifth, the highest emphasis will be put on economic 
measures in government spending. We have introduced many 
extensive schemes to bring about effective economy, and these 
will be sincerely implemented. 
  39. Our effort, with the package of measures I have 
outlined, 
is to effect savings to the tune of Rs95 crore in 1994/95. We 
are hopeful that we will find all-around support for achieving 
this goal. 
  40. The honorable members are well aware that the reforms in 
the sales tax system of the state that we undertook in last 
year's budget have been widely appreciated, as a very major 
scheme of tax simplification. The rationalization of rate 
structure; the extension of concessional rates to more raw 
materials, consumables, and packing materials; and enhancement 
of the exemption limit to a total turnover of one lakh have all 
been appreciated as a major reform package. 
  41. It is our intention to continue the process of tax 
reform 
and simplification. It is our aim to minimize cascading taxes. 
As a part of this process, we have decided to extend the 
concessional rate under Section 3(3) to some mineral oils and 
gases, used as raw materials. At the same time, diesel fuel 
cannot be entitled to concessional rate under section 3(3). To 
give effect to this, suitable amendments will be introduced. 
  42. In my last budget speech, I indicated the need to 
prevent 
evasion of sales tax. With this intention, I proceeded to 
include a few items that are evasion prone under Schedule VI.

  It may be noted that there is no change in the rate of tax 
in 
respect to the above items. The change being made is to include 
them under Schedule VI to prevent evasion of tax. 
  The rate on the tax on furniture will be increased from 8 
percent to 12 percent and furniture will also be included as a 
separate item under Schedule VI. 
  44. Last year, as a measure of simplification, we introduced 
the facility of a compounding provision on an optional basis on 
civil works contracts. [sentence as published] The compounding 
rate of tax at 2 percent for civil works contracts was also 
introduced. The time allowed to exercise the option for 1993/94 
was to 30 June 1993. 
  There have been recommendations to extend the period for 
exercising the option. We have decided to allow until 30 June 
1994 to exercise the option for the years 1993/94 and 1994/95. 
  45. In my last budget speech I indicated that we would 
discuss the question of exemption of various goods from tax, in 
order to tax such items that do not merit exemption. In tax 
reform we should keep in mind the need to widen the tax base, 
keeping the rates as low as possible. A large number of 
exemptions defeat this purpose. In the simplified system that we 
have implemented since last year, it becomes all the more 
essential that unnecessary exemptions be withdrawn. The high 
power sales tax reforms committee headed by B. Vijayaraghavan, 
IAS [Indian Administrative Service], in its report, recommended 
the complete withdrawal of almost all exemptions for goods and 
institutions. Even items of common use like paddy, rice, wheat, 
common salt, etc., were recommended for taxation. We have given 
careful thought to these recommendations and examined them in 
detail. We have decided to protect the poor from any possible 
increase in prices, and therefore, we have chosen to continue 
the exemption on a number of goods that are mainly used by the 
poor. The following will continue to be exempted from taxation, 
by specific entries in Schedule III--primary food stuff that is 
unprocessed, such as cereals, rice, wheat, fresh milk, common 
salt, fresh meat, fresh vegetables and fruits, etc.; some 
agricultural and horticultural produce, agricultural inputs, 
simple agricultural implements; animals other than race horses; 
pottery and palm products; family welfare items; blood and 
plasma; some life-saving medicines, certain country drugs and 
all physically-handicapped welfare prosthetics and appliances; 
unconventional energy devices and boilers using municipal waste; 
slates and slate pencils; wood covered lead pencils and chalk 
pieces; cloth rags; UNICEF greeting cards and calendars; 
cycle-rikhshaw (without motor); electrical energy; bangles other 
than those made of platinum, gold, and silver; kum kum powder 
for ladies to wear on the forehead, eye-makeup and ready-made 
thali (marriage badge tied around the neck of the wife by the 
husband). 
  46. In addition to the above goods, synthetic gems, Xerox 
copies, laser copies, computer printouts on paper that has 
previously been taxed, and inter-state sales of coconuts will be 
exempted. 
  47. The exact list of items that will continue to be 
exempted 
is stated separately. 
  48. The items for which exemptions are being withdrawn are 
brought under Schedule I. 
  49. Exemptions from sales tax to institutions involves 
greater diversity and complexity. These will be reviewed later. 
  50. In the last budget the union finance minister indicated 
that the question of levying a value-added tax would be referred 
to the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. There 
are very many detailed issues that have to be gone into in the 
consideration of implementing a value-added tax system. At this 
stage it would therefore not be appropriate to consider radical 
changes in the sales tax structure, such as the merging of 
surcharge taxes, additional sales taxes, or the passing on of 
additional sales taxes. We shall examine all these issues 
together at the appropriate stage. 
<H5>  Luxury Tax </H5>
  51. Cigarette smoking is injurious to health. It is not only 
a luxury, but a dangerous luxury. I have decided to impose a 
luxury tax on the supply of tobacco, except beedies. [indigenous 
smoking product]. The tax rate will be 5 percent. This tax will 
be levied on all tobaccoists whose receipts on account of all 
the supply of tobacco is above Rs1 lakh per financial year. 
Suitable legislative amendments to the Tamil Nadu Luxury Tax Act 
are in the current session of the legislature. 
  52. The high power sales tax reforms committee recommended 
that cable television be brought under the Entertainment Tax 
Act, since the network is expanding rapidly. The government has 
decided to accept the recommendation and levy an entertainment 
tax of 40 percent on the gross receipts of the cable television 
operators. 
  53. With a view to encouraging the production of new films 
in 
the state and to enable low budget Tamil films to withstand the 
competition from films produced in other languages and dubbed in 
Tamil, it is proposed that a higher entertainment tax be levied 
on the dubbed films screened in the state by 10 percent in each 
slab. 
  54. A suitable amendment to the Tamil Nadu Entertainment Tax 
Act will be brought in the current session of the legislature. 
<H5>  Excise Duty </H5>
  55. We propose that rates of excise duty on certain 
categories of Indian-made foreign spirits (IMFS) be 
rationalized. The medium brands and premium brands will be 
charged at the same rate of Rs75 per liter. The present rate for 
medium brands is Rs70 per liter and for premium brands will be 
Rs85 per liter. The revised rates will be effective as of 1 
April 1994. 
<H5>  Motor Vehicles Tax </H5>
  56. It is proposed to make certain changes in the taxation 
structure of light motor vehicles. The present rates payable are 
as follows:

  58. The existing taxation rate for ordinary motor cabs 
(metered taxis) is Rs120 per quarter. We propose to revise this 
rate to Rs150 per quarter. 
  59. In the case of tourist cabs, the existing rate of Rs150 
per quarter is proposed to be revised to Rs200 per quarter. 
  60. The existing rate of taxation for tourist maxicabs 
[large 
taxi] of Rs125 per seat per quarter we propose to be revised to 
Rs150 per seat per quarter. 
  61. The existing rate of taxation for All India Tourist Omni 
Buses is Rs500 per seat per quarter. We propose it be changed to 
Rs1,000 per seat per quarter, to bring it on a par with ordinary 
omni buses. 
  62. The tax structure in the case of goods carriages is 
proposed to be modified as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Laden weight             |Existing rate            |Proposed rate            | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  63. The tax in respect to stage carriages is proposed to be 
revised as follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|--                       |Existing rate            |Proposed rate            | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |in Rs per seat per quarter                         | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Express services         |300                      |360                      |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Metro services           |50                       |60                       | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The existing surcharge rates will continue unchanged.                        | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  64. For the vehicles belonging to recognized educational 
institutions, the taxation rate is proposed to be revised from 
Rs1,500 per annum to Rs2,000 per annum. In addition, we propose 
that the tax on vehicles belonging to unrecognized educational 
institutions be revised to Rs500 per quarter from the present 
rate of Rs110 per quarter. This brings the tax on vehicles 
belonging to both recognized and unrecognized educational 
institutions on a par. 
  65. Earlier, rig-mounted vehicles were treated as goods 
carriages. However, the Government of India, by a recent 
notification, has reclassifed them as non-transport vehicles. 
Therefore, it is proposed to incorporate a separate category in 
the First Schedule of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Taxation Act, 
1974, to cover rig-mounted vehicles and to levy a lump sum tax 
of Rs2,500 per annum on them, irrespective of the laden weight. 
  66. The revised rates I have announced will take effect 1 
April 1994. 
<H5>  Electricity Tax </H5>
  67. The Tamil Nadu Electricity (Taxation on consumption) 
Act, 
1962 provides for the levying of a tax on the consumption of 
electricity. The taxation rate is 4 percent on the sale of 
electricity. Meanwhile, we have in the last budget brought the 
normal sales tax rates under the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax 
Act of 1958 to a standard rate system of 3, 8, 12, 16, 20, 25, 
50 percent. [sentence as published] All rates have been brought 
into the revised system. Consistent with this change the rate of 
tax on consumption of electricity will be rationalized from 4 to 
5 percent effective 1 April 1994. Domestic connections including 
hut connections, agricultural consumers, and captive generation 
will continue to be exempted from this tax. Fresh legislation to 
provide for the revised rate of taxation will be introduced in 
the current session of the legislation. 
<H5>  Agricultural Income Tax </H5>
  68. The rates for deduction of replanting expenditure under 
section 5(G) of the Agricultural Income Tax Act have been fixed 
based on the economic life of the various plantation crops. Due 
to technological improvements in recent years and the 
development of high yielding varieties, many of the plantation 
crops now have a shorter economic life. We therefore propose to 
increase the permissible deduction for replanting expenditure 
under section 5(G) to 2.5 percent of the acreage in the case of 
tea, 3.33 percent for rubber and coffee, and 10 percent for 
cardamum. 
  69. At present, admissible interest on borrowed working 
capital is limited under section 5(K) of the Act to 9 percent on 
an amount equivalent to 25 percent of the agricultural income. 
In order to simplify matters, we have decided to amend this 
clause allowing full deduction of the interest on working 
capital. 
  70. At present there are certain restrictions on 
admissibility of expenditure in respect to bonus, provident fund 
contributions, gratuity, and other benefits to the employees. We 
propose to amend the Agricultural Income Tax Act to bring it on 
a par with the Income Tax Act 1961 in respect to these items. 
  71. These changes will take effect as of the assessment year 
1994/95. 
<H5>  Conclusion </H5>
  72. I indicated earlier in my speech that the deficit for 
1994/95 would be Rs398.05 crore. With the measures relating to 
economy in expenditure, better return for services rendered by 
government and better targeting of schemes to benefit the poor, 
the net saving will be Rs95 crore. The net effect of the various 
taxation measures I have outlined will be Rs48 crore. The net 
final deficit for 1994/95 will be Rs255.05 crore. We will seek 
to control the closing deficit for 1993/94 and thus keep the 
overall deficit in 1994/95 within manageable levels. 
  73. The continuously widening large revenue deficits 
indicates clearly that the 10th Finance Commission would have to 
take note of Tamil Nadu's case for a grant to cover the 
recurring unplanned revenue account deficit. To secure justice 
for our state, we shall endeavor to explain to the Commission, 
the great need for help. 
  74. We hope that in the coming year, the Center will take 
steps to improve the collection of revenues under basic excise 
duties, so that the states get enhanced shares. We are relying 
on a greater buoyancy under this tax to provide some relief in 
1994/95. We have already expressed our desire to the vice 
president of the Planning Commission, to issue bonds for sale, 
to raise funds for providing services for basic necessities for 
towns like supply of drinking water and electricity. We hope we 
will be able to get a substantial amount from this source. With 
this amount and also effective regulatory steps to control 
expenses for the new projects under the unplanned category, we 
firmly believe that we can control the 1994/95 budget deficit 
and at the same time achieve the planned outlay of Rs2,750 crore. 
  75. The people of Tamil Nadu have given a great victory to 
the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party led by 
revolutionary leader Dr. J. Jayalalitha, to usher in an era of 
growth and prosperity in the state. This administration is 
functioning in a manner that will keep the trust of the people. 
The threats from foreign militants and extremists have been 
rooted out. In the wake of this unique achievement, the people 
expect that an all-out effort will be made to march forward. The 
comprehensive social security net will in large measure protect 
the poor people and raise their standard of living. Our efforts 
for planned growth have enabled Tamil Nadu to move forward into 
a higher growth trajectory. This is evident from the track 
record of increasing the fiscal plan allotments and also 
implementing it effectively. This in itself is an eloquent 
testimony to our achievement. 
  76. We vowed to provide the people of Tamil Nadu a fine 
standard of living. In the process of carrying out that promise 
we have had to face many tribulations. The Honorable Dr. J. 
Jayalalitha has been championing the cause of the poor and 
underprivileged people in every forum. Her selfless dedication, 
devotion, and foresight have been responsible for recovering 
Tamil Nadu from the difficult economic crisis and for enabling 
it to move forward in the path of peace and prosperity. Today, 
Tamil Nadu stands out as a beautiful garden of peace, marching 
forward with confidence to provide its people with a high 
quality of life. This administration, which works with 
dedication to the cause, has been able to protect and improve 
the quality of life of the poor people. I firmly believe that, 
while many new projects in the budget we initiated will raise 
the standard of living of the poor people, they will continue to 
stimulate further our growth achievements. This budget with an 
unprecedented outlay of funds gives great importance to the 
overall growth. We will work tirelessly to attain the goals we 
desired. 
  77. I expect the honorable members of this Assembly who 
participate in the debate to offer constructive suggestions on 
the basis of fairmindedness, justice, and honesty, without 
heated arguments. 
  78. In preparing this report on the state of finance so 
efficiently the secretary of the Department of Finance M.N. 
Narayanan, IAS, and other officials of his department and other 
departments as well deserve my heartfelt thanks. 
  79. I request the Assembly kindly accept the report on the 
financial position for the year 1994/95.

Finance Minister 
Madras, 23 March 1994

Panguni 9. 
<H8>  Part II </H8>
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  1. Though Tamil Nadu was struck by severe storms and floods 
in November 1993, our state is in a new position to attain a 
record level in food production of 1 million tons. Our farmers 
deserve the highest praise for this achievement. 
  2. On a national level there is a prevalent idea that, 
instead of giving subsidies on fertilizers, electricity, and 
water, it is better to increase investments in both private and 
public sector undertakings involved in producing products 
related to agriculture. It is argued that, as we set aside a big 
sum for subsidies, we are unable to provide the necessary 
capital to provide facilities for our farmers in the villages. 
Recently in Tamil Nadu there has been a prevalent trend of 
rising prices of essential agricultural products. In Tamil Nadu, 
the procurement prices of a rough variety of rice per quintal 
has been raised to Rs310, from Rs270; a medium quality of rice, 
raised to Rs330, from Rs280; and the nicer variety raised to 
Rs330 from Rs290. Thus, the procurement price of rice after 1990 
has doubled. For sugarcane, the recommended price per ton has 
been raised to Rs450, from Rs345. The farmers of our state have 
enthusiastically welcomed the increased prices for their 
products, treating it as a gift for all their toil. As a result, 
farmers' dependence on the subsidies has been reduced. The trade 
relationship between agriculture and other manufacturing sectors 
has improved. 
  3. In order to accelerate the growth of agriculture, we have 
to pay special attention to the following points of great 
importance. Greater efforts should be made to bring fallow land 
under cultivation. Water resources should be preserved and used 
in a more efficient manner. By improving the irrigation 
facilities, the cultivation of other food grains would be 
enhanced. Emphasis on production of high value crops, 
agricultural exports, cultivation of wasteland, and capital 
investment in agriculture are to be intensified. New 
technological methods including environmental development should 
be improved in order to bring down the cost. Human resources 
development should be given high priority. Special plans for 
cultivation of various kinds of food grains and increase in 
their yields should be intensified. We will implement this 
policy enthusiastically in 1994/95. 
  4. I want to mention a few important aspects of the new 
plans 
we propose to implement in 1994/95. Through our scheme to 
improve the fallow lands that were not cultivated before, we 
have brought 40,000 acres under cultivation. In 1994/95 we 
intend to bring 25,000 acres of wasteland under cultivation. 
  5. We have been giving high priority to the water resources 
protection scheme. As a result of so many irrigation projects, 
we intend to cover 214,250 acres. Kamarajar, 
Pasumpon-Muthuramalinga-Thevar, and Ramanthapuram districts will 
benefit in 1994/95 through a multi-resources water improvement 
plan, costing Rs13.51 crore. In those districts 25,700 acres 
will get water. In the second phase, at a cost of Rs41.72 crore, 
106,000 acres in Tirunelveli-Kattabomman, and V.O. Chidambaranar 
districts will benefit. Water-drop spray irrigation schemes will 
be further strengthened. It is expected that this scheme will 
benefit 10,000 acres in 1994/95. The scheme is extended to cover 
the sugarcane crop also in 1994/95. For this scheme, a sum of 
Rs6.7 crore may be allocated. 
  6. We have decided to take steps to promote the increase of 
exports of agricultural products. In order to promote 
cultivation of horticultural produce and to increase their 
export, we propose that a new cooperative be started. It will be 
called the Tamil Nadu Horticultural Cooperative Union. Emphasis 
will be on the cultivation of cashew nuts, mushrooms, onions, 
etc. Processing of seeds and raising of flowering plants will be 
treated as professions, and to promote them, necessary financial 
aid will be given. 
  7. In the new situation that has evolved after the 
acceptance 
of the Dunkel draft, we should be sure that the farmers get the 
improved variety of seeds. The honorable chief minister has 
given orders that in order to provide our farmers with improved 
seeds and technology, an expert high level committee should 
investigate current research fields and give guidance. For the 
first time in our country, it is the Tamil Nadu Agricultural 
University that made a great achievement in producing a new MGR 
[expansion not given] hybrid rice. 
  8. In our state, special efforts should be made to 
popularize 
among the peasants the use of manure from waste of living beings 
and integrated insecticide methods to improve cultivation, 
keeping up good environmental standards. The budget has provided 
Rs25 lakhs for the production of manure and Rs10 lakhs for the 
development of the integrated pesticide method. 
  9. We have started a program to give training to women in 
agriculture with the aid from Danida [Danish International 
Development Agency] at a cost of Rs28.74 crore. This scheme 
called TANWA II [expansion not given] will have a published 
budget allotment of Rs1.80 crore. On the completion of the 
program, 7.44 lakhs women will have the benefit of training in 
agriculture. We propose to start very soon a human resources 
development scheme at a cost of Rs76 crore with aid from the 
World Bank. This scheme will help enlarge the knowledge and 
ability of the officials of agricultural universities, 
veterinary universities, forestry departments, agricultural 
engineering departments, and fisheries departments. 
  10. Under the Tamil Nadu agricultural development scheme, 
with World Bank aid, we have undertaken various projects to 
benefit agriculture and village areas at a cost of Rs310 crore. 
In order to identify areas of low productivity and to improve 
the productivity, we will make a special effort in 1994/95. The 
Tamil Nadu agricultural development scheme will have an 
allotment of Rs41.81 crore for the year 1994/95. 
  11. An oil seeds production scheme will be implemented at a 
cost of Rs11 crore. Special focus will be on growing oil-giving 
palmyra trees. These trees are planted on 2,500 acres in the 
districts of Tiruchirapalli, Tanjore, and 
Nagapatttinam-quaidemillath. 
<H5>  Food Processing </H5>
  12. We have selected food processing as an important 
department. Our objective is to select five important products 
and to encourage extensive foreign investment in the processing 
sector. In order to secure for our farmers good prices for 
their produce, we will provide them with market contact 
facilities. To ensure quick progress in this new and big 
venture, a committee will be formed. 
  13. To undertake the food processing work, an organization 
to 
be known as the Agri-Business Consortium, consisting of small 
farmers, will be started at Dharmapuri. 
  14. We intend to implement a scheme to improve the method of 
producing boiled rice at the Bolur rice factory, owned by the 
Tamil Nadu Consumers Trade Association, at a cost of Rs5.63 
lakhs. There is also another important effort--the daily 
production capacity at the rice mill in Ammanpettai, which is 
owned by the same association, will be increased to 200 metric 
tons from 100 metric tons, at a cost of Rs3.19 crore. The method 
of paddy [rice before harvest] boiling will also be improved. 
<H5>  Irrigation </H5>
  15. Tamil Nadu has almost exhausted its surface water 
resources. We have very little water resources beneath the 
ground surface. We must increase our water resources. The 
honorable members of the Assembly may recall that in order to 
make the Central Government ask the Karnataka government to 
implement the decision of the impartial tribunal on the Cauvery 
water dispute, the Honorable Chief Minister Dr. Jayalalitha went 
on a historic fast, unto death, in July 1993. During those 
critical days, the people of Tamil Nadu gave their great 
emotional support to their chief minister. The Central minister 
for water resources met with the chief minister and announced 
that the Central Government would appoint two committees to be 
involved in implementing the tribunal's interim order. We trust 
that the Karnataka government will implement the order of the 
tribunal in the coming year. 
  16. There has not been substantial progress in implementing 
the Peninsular River water grid scheme. They should at least 
divert the course of the westward rivers without any further 
delay. The Pamba-Achan Koil-Vaigai link, in particular, should 
be implemented at the earliest. We hope the Central Government 
will treat the Peninsular River water grid as a high-priority 
project. In its first phase, the Pampa-Achan Koil link should be 
implemented. 
  17. In 1994/95 there is a budget provision of Rs125.56 crore 
for irrigation schemes, including small irrigation projects. We 
have to take steps to make sure that efficient use of 
above-ground water resources is made. With this thought in mind, 
we have developed the Tamil Nadu water resources scheme with 
World Bank aid. In the 1994/95 budget statement on our financial 
position, Rs40 crore has been allotted for this purpose. This 
scheme, which is to be completed in seven years, is estimated to 
cost Rs952 crore. This will help in repairs and in renovating 
the existing irrigation facilities and improve their efficiency; 
it will also facilitate the increased participation of farmers 
in the maintenance of irrigation facilities, and it will protect 
water resources and stabilize the established irrigation 
facilities. The efficiency of operating methods and systems of 
the irrigation section of the Department of Public Works will be 
developed completely, and it will acquire expert knowledge in 
how to serve the farmers better. The scheme will include the 
following: 

  -  Pallarru Dam irrigation project 
  -  Seyyaru Dam irrigation project 
  -  Poinee Dam irrigation project 
  -  Lower Bhavani Dam irrigation project 
  -  Vaigai irrigation project 
  -  Parambikulam-Aliyaru irrigation project. 

  18. We trust the World Bank will give us the clearance for 
the scheme. 
  19. We have to make sure that the irrigation facilities are 
properly maintained. We have set aside Rs200 per hectare for 
1993/94 and Rs265 per hectare for 1994/95. We are determined to 
adopt our ancient practice of involving farmers fully in the 
maintenance of the irrigation facilities. This is gaining 
importance as a part of our effort to enhance the effectiveness 
of our irrigation arrangements. We propose to encourage farmers 
to form unions to take care of the canals under categories B, C, 
and D. We have enacted a law to widen and extend the irrigation 
facilities to the fourth region also, under the Perambukulam 
Aliyaru project. 
  20. In 1994/95, we enacted a law to widen the irrigation 
facilities to the fourth region under the Parambikulam-Aliyaru 
scheme. This will provide irrigation facilities to 175,000 acres. 
  21. We propose to provide irrigation facilities in 1994/95 
to 
8,342 acres at a total cost of Rs27 crore, implementing the 
north Pachhayyaru project. Work will start in 1994/95 on the 
Adavi Nainar Koil irrigation project, which will provide 
irrigation facilities to 5,625 acres at a cost of Rs37.69 crore. 
The Periyaru Vaigai link canal service will be completed in 
1994/95, and 5,400 acres will benefit from this service. 
  22. The national water resources management scheme, 
implemented with World Bank aid, will be completed in 1994/95. 
Under this scheme, in 1993/94, we undertook, at the cost of 
Rs7.51 crore, the Thozudoor irrigation arrangement work, and at 
a cost of Rs4.88 crore, the Chittaru irrigation arrangement 
work. Work is about to begin on the Manjaru Dam project, at a 
cost of Rs1.23 crore. Under this project, three subsidiary water 
dam plans for Tirukoilur, Pilavukkal, and Krishnagiri will be 
implemented at a cost of Rs20 crore in 1994/95. 
  23. Irrigation lakes are very important sources of water. We 
intend to continue to implement the scheme to modernize the 
lakes with the aid from the European Economic Group. In 1994/95, 
Rs22 crore will be allocated for this scheme. So far, 
modernization of 157 lakes, which serve 20,700 acres, has begun. 
In 1994/95, 130 lakes, which serve 135 acres, will be modernized. 
  24. In the budget speech last year, I mentioned we would 
bring the former Zamin lakes under the jurisdiction of either 
the Department of Public Works or the Village Panchayat Unions 
on the basis of the acreage they serve. Efforts in this 
direction are being made. On the whole, the administrative 
set-up for about 4,720 former Zamin lakes has to be reorganized. 
The plan to standardize them and reorganize their administrative 
control is expected to be completed in a two-year period. This 
plan will benefit 1.96 lakh acres. 
  25. This administration attaches high priority to the plans 
for intensifying the growth of rural areas. For this plan, in 
1993/94, the allotment was Rs126.30 crore, and in 1994/95 it 
will be Rs160.53 crore. A special self-sufficiency scheme has 
been successfully implemented at a total cost of Rs350 crore. As 
a result of this scheme, the basic service facilities have been 
provided to all the rural areas and settlements. To ensure 
proper maintenance, services, and management under this scheme, 
in 1994/95 a follow-up action will be undertaken. 
  26. To provide units in Tamil Nadu, where the democratic 
process is in various stages of development, with effective 
guidelines, a new legislation incorporating the 73d and 74th 
amendments to the Constitution will be introduced in the current 
session. This will help in examining the financial resources for 
the administrative units, and distribute among them the 
necessary funds for their effective functioning. They have 
already taken adequate steps to strengthen the financial 
resources of these democratic units. In addition to this, we 
have decided to develop a new guideline to strengthen and 
support the financially weak units and to facilitate their 
undertaking maintenance and reform procedures. The government 
will give a grant equal to the cess [as published] amounts. The 
size of the grant to the district decentralized plan has been 
doubled from Rs20 crore to Rs40 crore in 1994/95. Giving these 
funds without any condition, marks another step toward 
encouraging the formulation of a plan of action from the 
beginning. 
  27. The Centrally-funded employment schemes were started on 
1 
October 1993 in 57 Panchayat unions in 12 districts. In 1993/94, 
a sum of Rs3.50 crore was allotted to the scheme. In 1994/95, 
this amount will increase. In the wake of the introduction of 
assured employment plans, the state plan has been allotted Rs10 
crore in 1994/95. This plan will be revised for implementing in 
50 high-growth areas in nine districts. 
  28. We intend to devote special attention to the proper 
maintenance of properties and to give support to the 
municipalities. In our state, we have 98,475 deeply bored pumps, 
36,325 filtered pumps, and 26,462 electric pumps. To help in the 
maintenance of these properties, the budget has allotted Rs564 
crore to the weaker municipalities. Special attention will be 
given to the maintenance of street lighting under the 
jurisdiction of the municipalities. To ensure proper lighting in 
the streets, we have been taking special steps. 
  29. We propose to grant permission to begin a special 
internal financial accounting for the Panchayat unions to ensure 
proper management and maintenance of irrigation lakes under 
their control. This will help in carrying out proper maintenance 
services of 23,761 irrigation lakes under the Panchayat unions. 
<H5>  Cattle Breeding </H5>
  30. We have chosen animal husbandry as an important sector 
for overall growth under the Tamil Nadu agricultural development 
plan for services relating to cattle breeding in 1994/95. Rs6.05 
crore has been allotted for this plan. Efforts should be made to 
develop artificial insemination facilities. Three sperm banks 
will be established in Sivaganga, Cuddalore, and Saidapettai at 
a cost of Rs74 lakhs. The honorable members will be happy to 
learn that the technique of using frozen sperm has been widely 
extended to all the 2,770 artificial insemination centers. The 
cattle breeding station at Echankottai, Orthanadu, and Osur have 
been modernized. Artificial insemination methods as well will be 
greatly improved. 
  31. We have engaged experts in the fields of cattle 
breeding, 
production of fodder of good quality and good-quality seed for 
fodder crops, diagnostics of cattle diseases, and prevention of 
epidemics, etc. As a result, the service from important 
departments will greatly improve. 
  32. Methods of treating and prevention of cattle disease and 
treatment facilities are being improved. Four hundred mobile 
cattle dispensaries will be opened. Ten new veterinary hospitals 
will be opened. The budget has provided Rs5.10 crore for cattle 
maternity and medicines. 
  33. We have achieved rapid advancement in the growth of 
milk-producing farms in 1992/93. The daily consumption of milk 
was 11.83 lakh liters, and it grew to be 14.11 lakh liters in 
1993/94. In order to facilitate extending this "white 
revolution," we will attach great importance to the production 
of high priced items in this sector. At Sholinga Nallur near 
Madras, a new, big milk production farm is under construction. 
It will have a capacity to produce four lakh liters of milk per 
day at a cost of Rs25 crore. The building of the farm will be 
completed in September 1994. In the coming year, two new milk 
freezing units will be started, and the total freezing capacity 
will increase to 3.72 lakh liters per day. 
<H5>  Fishing </H5>
  34. This administration, with the aid of the National 
Cooperative Development Organization, has embarked upon an 
integrated scheme for deep-sea fishing development at a total 
cost of Rs15.88 crore. This scheme will benefit 6,050 fishermen. 
For this scheme, a sum of Rs3.12 crore will be allotted in 
1994/95. This results in benefiting fishermen in Tanjore, 
Ramanthapuram, and V.O. Chidambaranar, Chingelpet-MGR, and 
Kanyakumari districts. 
  35. In 1994/95, with aid from the National Cooperative 
Development Corporation and the European Economic Community, an 
internal fisheries development scheme will be implemented at a 
cost of Rs6.60 crore. This will provide for fish breeding in 
lakes, etc., in the districts of 
Villupuram-Ramaswami-Padayachiar, North Arcot Ambedkar, and 
Thiruvannamalai-Sumbuvarayar. Seventeen crore baby fish are 
required per year. This project will help in increasing the 
supply of fish. 
  36. We have been giving support to the marine life 
protection 
effort undertaken by the private sector. In order to provide 
alternative employment opportunities to 600 fishermen at a cost 
of Rs13.88 crore marine beings development scheme has been 
started on a 150-hectare area in Ramanthapuram district. This 
large scheme is being implemented with the help of the National 
Cooperative Development Corporation and MPEDA [expansion not 
given]. Another aquatic culture project will be started by the 
Tamil Nadu Fisheries Development Corporation at Tharuvaikulam in 
V.O. Chidambaranar district at a cost of Rs220 crore. 
  37. This administration has always given high priority to 
the 
welfare of fishermen. In 1993/94, at a cost of Rs5 crore, 2,000 
permanent houses were constructed for free allotment to the 
fishermen. In 1994/95, another 2,000 will be constructed for 
free allotment. In 1993/94, those periods during which there was 
no income for fishermen, the state government paid Rs270 per 
month for up to four months to compensate for the loss of their 
income. One hundred thirty-one thousand fishermen received this 
compensation, and it cost us Rs13.20 crore. This serves as a 
great security scheme for the fishermen. 
<H5>  Forestry </H5>
  38. We have to save our current acreage of forests and also 
develop and extend the forest area. In the current year, a 
scheme to extend forests up to 136 lakh acres is being 
implemented. In 1994/95 we propose to bring under the scheme 1.5 
lakh acres. For development of forestry the total of Rs46.05 
crore has been allotted in the budget for 1994/95. 
  39. The community's scheme to develop the forest, which is 
implemented with the aid from the Swedish International 
Development Agency (SIDA), will be completing its second phase 
in 1994/95. We have budgeted Rs25-35 crore for this. An area of 
7.5 lakh acreas has been brought under the community forest 
development scheme. We have evolved a forestry plan interfaced 
with villages for which we hope to get aid from SIDA. This 
scheme is expected to cost Rs265 crore. 
  40. We have also formulated a new project, namely the Tamil 
Nadu Forestry Project, which will cost Rs300 crore. This has 
been submitted to the World Bank for aid. This is meant to 
preserve biodiversity and animals in the forests. This project 
is to interface 1.83 lakh hectare forest area, and 800 villages. 
  41. Under the agricultural development scheme we have 
provided Rs9 crore for forestry project services in 1994/95. 
  42. A special forestry project will be implemented under the 
mountainous region development scheme in the Nellagiri district. 
In 1994/95 an area of 1,375 acres will be brought under this 
scheme at a cost of Rs3 crore. We will undertake in 1994/95 
forestry services and soil protection services on 6,250 acres on 
the slopes of the Western Ghats at a cost of Rs2.48 crore. 
  43. The honorable members are well aware of the Tamil Nadu 
Tea Plantation Corporation's plan for tea cultivation on 7,500 
acres. Under this plan two more new tea factories are being set 
up at a cost of Rs6.00 crore. In 1994/95, an area of 1,500 acres 
will be brought under the scheme, costing Rs1.20 crore. We have 
secured aid from the National Agricultural and Rural Development 
Bank. 
  44. The Tamil Nadu Plantation Corporation has started a 
scheme to increase the planting area for trees that give paper 
pulp. In 1994/95 this kind of tree will be planted on an area of 
1,200 acres. In addition, the cashew nut cultivation improvement 
scheme will be implemented on an area of 18,000 acres. 
  45. We have made special effort to preserve and protect our 
forest wealth. In 1993/94 a sum of Rs25 lakhs was allotted for 
carrying out various steps for the protection of our forests. In 
1994/95 also an equivalent amount will be set aside for this 
purpose. We intend to develop the State Forestry Research 
Corporation at Vandalur. For this institution the budget has 
provided Rs10 lakhs. 
<H5>  Industries </H5>
  46. The honorable members of this Assembly may recall that 
our honorable chief minister formulated a unique industrial 
policy for our state in 1992. This policy has been the basis of 
our industrial growth. The Central Government has now pointed 
out that as a part of the liberalizing effort the state 
government should carry out more reforms. We have identified the 
important sectors for necessary action. We have succeeded in 
creating a good industrial climate in our state. Tamil Nadu is 
the one state in the country that has provided the best basic 
facilities for industrial growth, so says the Center for 
Industrial Economic Research. Tamil Nadu is the one state that 
does not have any electric power cut. We are determined to 
maintain this progress. Whenever any kind of approval for 
companies is needed, they can go to a single-window clearance. 
We have already put forth necessary legislation for this 
arrangement. 
  47. Madras Industrial Park, developed under a commercial 
arrangement with Singapore, will soon be taken up for 
implementation. On the completion of this plan, it will cover 
8,000 acres. This will attract $1,000 as a new investment. We 
have selected a small list of entrepreneurs for this plan, and 
this group is expected to start work very soon. We have asked 
the Central Government to give us quick approval for this scheme. 
  48. We have to consider industrial growth at a national 
level. There is a great need for giving an impetus to increase 
the capital investment both in the public and private sectors. 
We hope the Indian industry will respond to the challenge of 
competition and ensure faster growth. 
  49. The southern fuel grid is an important plan. This will 
be 
a great help in promoting industrial growth in the southern 
region, in particular Tamil Nadu. The Honorable Chief Minister 
revolutionary leader Dr. J. Jayalalitha took the first step, 
hinting that the southern states will be ready to invest capital 
for this scheme just as the Konkan railway plan. For this scheme 
arrangements have been made to bring fuel from Oman. Now it is 
doubtful if gas will be available from Oman. We will emphasize 
that this grid scheme should be based on getting the gas that 
has been burning in Bombay High without any use to anybody. 
Later we can also add to it gas when it comes from Oman. To 
ensure that this plan is implemented immediately, the Central 
Government should take immediate action. 
  50. The budget has provided Rs10 crore for capital 
investment 
for the Tamil Nadu Basic Industrial Improvement Corporation 
(TACID). This will establish development centers with a view 
toward speeding up progress, in Perunthurai in Periyar District, 
Gangaikondan in Tizunelveli-Kattabomman District, and Panangudi 
in Nagapattinam-Quaide-Millath District. This corporation has 
taken charge of implementing special development centers at 
Nilakottai in Dindukkal-Anna District and another in Dharmapuri 
District. To speed up the industrial growth, we propose to 
establish a new development center on a large scale on an area 
of 1,000 acres near Madras. At Thiruppur, with the aid from ILFS 
[expansion not given], the Industrial Infrastructure Development 
Corporation will implement the scheme to improve the basic 
necessities for industries. It is expected that the scheme will 
cost Rs550 crore. 
  51. Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd has a big scheme to 
double its present annual production of 90,000 tons to 1.80 lakh 
tons. It has obtained $75 million from the World Bank. The 
budget has provided Rs200 crore. This scheme has been hailed as 
an exemplary unit that operates using agricultural waste, 
without causing any harm to the environment. It is unfortunate 
that the Central Government, in its current budget, has 
withdrawn its exemption from excise duty granted earlier to this 
company. We appeal to the Central Government to grant this 
company the exemption from excise duty. This company has now 
undertaken a big expansion project and deserves the exemption. 
  52. We have been consistently taking steps to create a 
climate for quick growth of small-scale industries in our state. 
As per the new economic policy, the growth of small-scale 
industries will certainly increase job opportunities. These 
industries should be getting their funds from the Department of 
Public Works, etc. Our efforts to get their dues paid in time 
have proved to be helpful. We received 115 complaints, out of 
which 111 were looked into and an adequate response was given. 
The rate of low pressure electricity allowed under the rules was 
raised from 130 to 150. This has been welcomed by the industry. 
The industrial entrepreneurs development scheme will be 
implemented in the coming year, and this will facilitate 
training 10,000 women. In 1994/95 "Citgo" will construct 200 
industrial sheds. Fifty improved sites will be allotted for this 
purpose. It is indeed an achievement that 156 industrial sheds 
were erected at Mudaliyar Palayam, near Tiruppur. Citgo has been 
working on building 100 industrial sheds for those involved in 
the manufacture of knitted dresses. A similar industrial estate 
is being built at Palladam in Coimbatore District. Citgo has 
undertaken the work of erecting Revolutionary Leader Dr. J. 
Jayalalitha Electron Research Center at Guindy. This will 
provide directly and indirectly employment opportunities to 
8,000 persons. A new leather industrial estate will be 
established near Madras, with technological help from the United 
Nations Development Program. 
  53. Tamil Nadu has developed plans to attract industrial 
entrepreneurs to start industrial projects in Tamil Nadu. To 
make this state an ideal place for starting industries, the 
state government has been working very hard. The honorable 
members of this Assembly may recall my earlier statement that we 
had decided to put forth an amendment to treat the deferred 
sales tax as having been remitted to fulfill the object of 
Section 43B of the Sales Tax Act. We discussed this with the 
Center, and on the basis of their clarification, we have issued 
an order in regard to the amendment. This will facilitate 
industries' getting all the needed benefits. I have no doubt 
that the industries will welcome our action. The method of 
deferred sales tax after a review by the Industrial Financial 
Aid Bureau will be made applicable to the weaker industrial 
units. The industries that in their beginning stages meet with 
difficulties can be helped by this action. It is our aim to make 
this concession applicable to all the weaker industries in 
accordance with the Weaker Industries Act. With a view toward 
increasing exports, we have decided to refund within a 
three-year period sales tax collected on purchases made by the 
Madras export trade activity region and their units, wholly 
involved in exports. Within the Madras export area, sales 
transactions between the various industrial sections do take 
place. But if the final sales are not inside the country, they 
would be exempt from the sales tax. 
<H5>  Electricity </H5>
  54. The highlight of the power situation in Tamil Nadu has 
been the absence of any demand for energy cuts. The Tuticorin 
thermal electric station has won continuously for six years the 
national productivity award and is poised to win again. In 
1992/93 it reached 76 percent of productivity. The Mettur 
thermal power station has also achieved 6.42 percent of 
productivity and is poised to win the award. We have been 
monitoring carefully the supply of coal to these stations in 
order to keep up effective functioning. 
  55. For generation of electricity the plan allotted Rs538.50 
crore for 1993/94 and Rs625 crore for 1994/95. The government 
has been giving great attention to the increase of power output. 
The first stage of the North Madras Thermal power project with 
three units of 210 Mw will be completed in 1994/95 and one unit 
will be synchronised with the grid. The work on the Basin Bridge 
gas-based power project with four units of 30 Mw has commenced. 
This project, aided by Japan's Economic Cooperative Fund will 
cost Rs367 crore. We expect this to be completed in 1995. New 
windmill units will be set up with 20 megawatts [Mw] of power. 
  56. For the first time in the whole country we have built 
two 
electric power stations in two cooperative sugar factories, one 
at Sethiathoppu and one at Cheyyarru, and they are performing 
successfully. At three more sugar cooperative factories, joint 
electric power stations in Mayiladuthurai, Kallakurichi, and 
Aroor will be built at a cost of Rs18 crore. On the whole, we 
can expect to build joint power stations at a total of 250 Mw 
capacity. 
  57. In planning to meet the demands of the state's power 
supply, we have to take into account the long-term power needs 
of the state. We have made progress in our efforts to meet power 
supply needs on a long-term basis. The Jayamkondan integrated 
lignite mining and power generation project, which is to 
generate 1,500 Mw, with an investment of Rs7,500 crore, will be 
taken up in the associate sector. This project's financial 
estimation is currently underway. We expect this project to 
begin to function very soon. The Central Government has granted 
us permission to start an electric power station under the 
private sector. We are also considering the proposal to start 
under the private sector two power stations with 500 Mw at North 
Madras and Tuticorin. At Cuddalore we intend to start a thermal 
power project with an initial capacity of 1,000 Mw and a final 
capacity of 2,000 Mw. For the power station to be established at 
Cuddalore we may have to bring in coal by sea for its 
functioning. We have to implement this project along with the 
Cuddalore harbor development scheme. The honorable chief 
minister requested the visiting Japanese high-level economic 
committee to consider investing in a coastal thermal energy 
project based on using imported coal. As the Central Government 
reduced the excise duty on imported coal, this project came to 
be considered. The honorable members of this Assembly will 
appreciate our great efforts to ensure a future without power 
cuts. 
  58. In Tamil Nadu, the delay caused by the Central 
Government 
in implementing its various energy projects has caused us grave 
concern. If negotiations do take place about digging the third 
mine and its allied power project, we would definitely welcome 
it. We have already informed the Center of our desire to invest 
and participate in the construction of the Koodankulam atomic 
electric power plant. We hope that the Central Government will 
make a decision about the scheme very soon. We have informed the 
Central Government of our desire to invest in the Kaiga atomic 
electric power station in the state of Karnataka. We trust the 
Central Government will take necessary action to invest in 
electric power generation schemes in Tamil Nadu. 
  59. We have taken stern action to reduce the loss in the 
process of supply and distribution of power. This loss in 
electrical wires has been reduced to 17.5 percent. The national 
average is 32 percent. The Tamil Nadu Electricity Board has been 
implementing a scheme to reduce this loss below 13 percent. 
  60. The honorable members of this Assembly are aware of our 
ardent efforts to promote and develop unconventional energy 
sources. As an important step in this effort, we signed an 
agreement with an American firm Messers: the Solar Power 
Corporation [as published], to produce energy from the heat of 
the ocean water. The 100-Mw project is to cost Rs800 crore. When 
we succeed in this effort, this will prove to be a major 
initiative to harness and utilize a perennial energy source. An 
integrated Panchayat energy project in 1994/95, at a cost of 
Rs30 lakhs will be implemented in 17 Panchayat union areas. The 
efforts to use solar power in heating water will be encouraged. 
  61. The honorable members are well aware of the severe 
financial difficulties the Tamil Electricity Board has to face. 
Even after the electric consumption charges were revised on 1 
March 1994, the deficit still remained at Rs300 crore. This 
indeed is a very serious condition. Even after the state 
government's aid of Rs350 crore, the situation did not improve. 
The government granted to the Electricity Board a remission of 
Rs100 crore in an interest-due account. The Center has been 
insisting that power supplied for agricultural pump sets should 
be charged 50 paise per unit. We understand from an audit that 
the energy used for pump sets has been increased by 16 percent. 
This is higher than the energy used by the industries as a 
whole. Therefore, it reveals that a substantial amount of 
electricity is being wasted or misused. As the state government 
itself is in financial trouble, it cannot increase its cash 
support to the Board. So, we have to face this difficult 
situation. 
<H5>  Road Transport </H5>
  62. The outlay for roads in 1993/94 was Rs110 crore and in 
1994/95 it is Rs120.94 crore. 
  63. The honorable members of the Assembly may recall that 
for 
the first time the state government has allotted for the 
maintenance of roads more than what the Ninth Finance Commission 
had prescribed as a guideline. We have raised the guideline 
amounts to the current level of prices. I am happy to say as per 
the enhanced guidelines the budget has provided for the 
maintenance of roads. For the maintenance of the road system, 
the 1993/94 budget provision was Rs145 crore, whereas in 1994/95 
it has been raised to Rs183 crore. 
  64. In 1991/92 we undertook a special road repair project, 
at 
a cost of Rs150 crore, to be completed in a five-year period, 
including the current year. We have so far allotted Rs95 crore. 
Under the scheme, we have carried out repairs on roads totaling 
6,430 km in length. In 1994/95 we will have Rs41.46 crore for 
this project. We propose that in 1994/95, the special road 
repair project cover roads of 3,500 km. This includes carrying 
out repairs on roads near the industrial sectors in 1994/95 at a 
cost of Rs5 crore, covering 4,300 km. As desired by the 
honorable members, we have given top priority in the budget for 
the road repair work, following the recent floods and storms. We 
hope we will be able to undertake intensive repair service as 
well as special road repair services within the budget allotment. 
  65. In the last budget speech I mentioned that a "bridges 
for 
the people" scheme will be implemented. As per the scheme, one 
bridge will be built for each legislative constituency. In 
1993/94 we began work on 208 bridges at a cost of Rs0.42 crore. 
The remaining 26 bridges will be constructed in municipal and 
corporation areas at a cost of Rs1.30 crore. In 1994/95, 234 
bridges covering all the legislative constituencies will be 
completed. 
  66. We intend to implement a new scheme with an outlay of 
Rs880 crore, aided by the World Bank. Under the scheme two-way 
traffic facilities covering a distance of 528 km will be 
constructed. Repair work on two-way traffic roads of 1,293 km 
length will be undertaken, and dilapidated bridges will also be 
reconstructed. As a result of this scheme, the quality of our 
roads will greatly improve. The World Bank has shown an interest 
in the scheme. We hope to get its approval very soon. 
  67. There has been heavy traffic congestion on such highways 
as Nagapattinam-Koodalur road, Coimbatore-Dindukkal road, and 
Perumbur-Manamadurai road. In order to reduce the traffic 
congestion, we propose to build four-lane transport facilities 
on such highways with help from the Infrastructure Financial 
Services, stationed in Bombay. This effort will greatly improve 
the quality of the highways in the state. 
  68. We have given great importance to the task of rural 
roads 
development. In 1994/95 all-weather rural roads for all areas 
with 1,000 residents according to the 1981 census will be 
provided with adequate road facilities. The budget has provided 
Rs18.50 crore for this scheme. As a part of the Tamil Nadu 
agricultural development scheme, 19 bazaar centers will have 
good road facilities at a cost of Rs45.28 crore. In 1994/95, 
Rs10 crore will be allotted for this scheme. This will help in 
constructing good roads 800 km in length. The bus route 
development scheme will continue to be implemented. A sum of 
Rs13 crore has been allotted in the 1994/95 budget. Under this 
scheme 500 km-long roads will be repaired and improved. Under 
the sugarcane cess [as published] fund scheme, Rs5 crore has 
been allotted for road development in 1994/95. 
  69. Traffic congestion in urban areas also has to be 
reduced. 
To achieve this goal, we have to embark upon a big-scale road 
development effort. Under the Tamil Nadu urban development 
scheme, as a part of TRAMP [expansion not given], we have 
undertaken 37 projects in 10 important cities at a cost of 
Rs144.89 crore. The 1994/95 budget has allotted Rs27 crore for 
this effort. 
  70. The eastern coastal road between Madras and Cuddalore 
has 
been meeting with many problems relating to technology, 
environment, and complications in agreements, etc. We are trying 
to solve these difficulties. We hope to see good progress in 
this project. For the development of this road, in 1994/95, a 
sum of Rs15 crore has been allocated. 
  71. The honorable members of this Assembly are aware of the 
difficult situation that our state bus transport system has to 
face in the wake of the revised prices for diesel fuel effective 
the first of February. As a result, the bus transport system has 
to take a loss to the tune of Rs60 crore in 1994/95. So we have 
to set this right in the course of time. We find it very 
difficult to cope with the situation caused by frequent rises in 
the price of diesel fuel. When these transport corporations 
strive hard to serve the people, the capacity of these 
corporations is affected. They could not acquire an adequate 
number of buses to replace the old ones or open up new services. 
Therefore, we may have to pave the way for a rise in bus fares. 
  72. We are evolving a program of action in this area, 
bearing 
in mind the financial guideline limitation. We are seeking aid 
from the United Nations Development Program. 
  73. With regard to the 17 industries that produce an 
enormous 
amount of dust, the responsibility for supervising the 
environment has been entrusted to the Tamil Nadu Dust Control 
Board. Identification of 119 industrial sections that produce a 
vast amount of dust was completed. Progress has been made in 
identifying sections that do not give out any dirt. At Manalur, 
a public facility will come into being to remove industrial 
waste likely to cause danger to sanitation. An emergency station 
to give aid is under construction at Manali. 
  74. We have been taking a series of vigorous steps to 
prevent 
pollution by leather tanning factories. Twenty-three general 
waste product purification stations are under construction. In 
1994 six will be completed. 
  75. In the cloth production industry, the dyeing section is 
the one that gives out a large amount of dust and dirt. To 
prevent the dirt, 16 general waste purification stations will be 
opened. 
  76. We are planning to conduct comprehensive research about 
the state's industrial waste regulatory plan, with help from the 
Asian Development Bank. On the basis of this report, which is 
due in April 1994, a detailed scheme will be prepared. 
  77. The honorable members of the Assembly are well aware of 
our efforts to prevent pollution in the Cauvery River. A 
comprehensive scheme that will cost Rs332 crore has been sent to 
Japan's Foreign Economic Cooperative Institute in order to 
secure its help. In the meanwhile we will undertake under the 
National River Development Plan an initial services project, at 
a cost of Rs2 crore. We will take steps to check the quality of 
water in the big rivers and lakes. 
  78. The honorable chief minister, the revolutionary leader 
Dr. Jayalalitha has ordered that an integrated coastal area 
development scheme should be started. To formulate this scheme, 
we have sought the expert help from the world renowned 
specialist Dr. M.S. Swaminathan. We will send the details of the 
scheme for external assistance. 
  79. We have formulated a scheme to clean up the waterways in 
big cities and prevent contamination from them and water 
cleaning services in greater Madras. Germany is examining the 
scheme for giving us aid. Many institutions undertook detailed 
studies. This also included removal of mud and mire. This is an 
appropriate time to make great efforts to clean waterways and 
restore them to their original condition. 
  80. We have developed a scheme to prevent our coastal areas 
from eroding, and we hope to get funds from the World 
Environment Development Fund. The scheme, which is estimated to 
cost Rs50 crore, will help in carrying out efforts to protect 
the coastal areas of Madras and Kanyakumari District, on a 
permanent basis. 
<H5>  Urban Development </H5>
  81. In Tamil Nadu 34.15 percent of the total state 
population 
lives in urban areas. Based on the population figures, the urban 
areas occupy third place, and to make an effort to raise their 
standard of living, we need enormously large sums of money. This 
calls for huge capital outlays from all sources including 
private sectors. 
  82. The Tamil Nadu urban area development plan, which is 
being implemented now with aid from the World Bank, is one of 
the biggest implemented so far. The plan is expected to have a 
total allotment of Rs150 crore in 1994/95. The plan includes 
many important sectors--development of housing sites, hutments, 
increase in transport facilities, and financial aid for urban 
development. 
  83. The one important advantage of implementing the Tamil 
Nadu urban development scheme is that we get new financial 
assistance for providing the basic facilities in urban areas. At 
the same time, with the object of giving financial aid to 
projects to provide basic necessities, we have organized a 
municipal development fund scheme. Municipalities have had 
problems paying back the loans from the insurance corporation, 
etc., resulting in the state government's taking up the 
responsibility for the loans. Taking all these into 
consideration, we have to examine the possibility of starting an 
infrastructure for giving help. We are appointing a committee to 
examine the problems involved and to submit a report of 
recommendations. 
  84. We propose to implement an integrated program for the 
urban poor. There have been a number of schemes to improve the 
plight of the poor, to raise their standard of living and their 
economic well-being. This integrated program will be helpful in 
bringing them together in a well-coordinated approach to deal 
with the problems effectively. In 1994/95 under this scheme, 1 
lakh poor families will benefit. 
<H5>  Madras Metropolitan Development </H5>
  85. The honorable members of this Assembly are aware that we 
started "Madras Vision 2000," with a view toward making the city 
a first-rate city in the whole country. For this, we will 
develop a scheme for capital investment which will include 
Madras Vision 2000. 
  86. To complete the implementation of this scheme before the 
year 2000, we give below the list of our targets with their 
outlays: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  87. Thus the Madras Vision 2000 plan envisions an investment 
of Rs4,000 crore. This will be implemented with the plan to make 
Madras beautiful, too, in the year 2000. Madras should be the 
place to attract new commercial centers and corporate office 
complexes, and it is our objective to make sure that the city's 
lifestyle is sophisticated with all amenities and make Madras 
attractive and powerful to be the financial capital of India. 
  88. The Metropolitan Infrastructure Development Corporation 
will be established, and the budget provides for this a sum of 
Rs15 crore as a share of the capital. Inclusive of the Central 
Government's share, the total capital will be Rs60 crore. This 
is a large sum of financial aid for fulfilling the needs for the 
basic necessities in the greater Madras corporation area. 
  89. We have started a program to generate electricity by 
using the waste products of the corporation area. This 8-Mw 
power station will be built at Perungudi, near Madras at a cost 
of Rs16 crore. This station will use balls, made from the waste 
material, for generating power. TICO [as published] firm 
undertakes this program under the joint sector. This is a big 
attempt to connect the waste materials with power generation. 
<H5>  Housing Facility </H5>
  90. "Shelter for all" is the policy of this government. The 
construction of houses helps in creating a substantial number of 
job opportunities and, as in Mexico and other countries, this is 
an important economic service. Therefore, we have given high 
priority to housing projects. 
  91. We have started an effort to survey the number of houses 
needed and the number of houses already distributed. On the 
basis of this survey we have to consider a long-term plan to 
provide for increasing the number of shelters and improved 
housing plots. Houses and hutments built by government 
institutions like the Housing Board and Hutments Board will be 
distributed in a better and improved manner. With a view to 
speeding up the improved house plots in urban and rural areas, 
we propose to strengthen the operative movement in the state and 
give it our wholehearted support. I have to mention, at this 
time, that the financial aid for housing in general and in 
particular regarding refinancing the loans from the National 
Housing Bank is not satisfactory. The Central Government should 
reform the process of granting loans and ensure that adequate 
amounts are there for such loans through commercial banking 
sources. In 1994/95, we will endeavor to provide housing 
facilities to 1.25 lakh families. 
  92. The Tamil Nadu Housing Board will build 20,700 shelters 
at a cost of Rs200 crore in 1994/95. The Tamil Nadu Hutment 
Board will build 750 new shelters in 1994/95, besides 
undertaking hutment area improvement for 10,000 families. At a 
cost of Rs1.5 crore, the "Shelter for Homeless" project will 
build 900 rows of shelters. Under the shelter for pavement 
dwellers plan, 2,275 shelters will be constructed. In 1994/95 
the Hutments Board will undertake four urban areas improvement 
projects. In 1994/95 urban housing cooperative societies will 
give financial support to build 10,000 shelters. 
  93. In the coming year, to enable us to implement big 
schemes 
for building houses, we trust that the rural housing projects 
will be reformed on a sound basis. For this we have to collect 
the loan installments in time. We will improve the efficiency of 
the rural housing projects through 165 taluk cooperative 
societies. The 1994/95 budget provides Rs5 crore for building 
30,000 shelters. We will continue to implement SUPRA [expansion 
not given], a novel scheme to erect 10,000 shelters in rural 
areas. This scheme will enhance the quality of rural housing 
facilities. 
  94. We propose to strengthen the services rendered by the 
Land Development Banks to lend money in a big way for housing 
projects. We have secured the necessary permission for the 
effort. In 1994/95 we propose to implement through the land 
cooperatives a scheme to grant loans to the housing effort. 
  95. The honorable members of this Assembly are well aware of 
our special projects for building houses for those who were 
affected by the recent floods and storms. Under the scheme, 
18,000 houses will be built. A sum of Rs8.10 crore has been 
allotted for this scheme. We are considering granting additional 
financial assistance to build houses in the wake of the recent 
reports of loss caused by the recent floods. We will implement 
this effort, after obtaining the necessary permission from the 
Central Government. 
<H5>  Education </H5>
  96. For education, the budget provides a total of Rs2,002.46 
crore. Under the category of revenue expenditure, the only big 
department that takes 22.04 percent of expense is the department 
of education. 
  97. The honorable chief minister, revolutionary leader Dr. 
J. 
Jayalalitha recently in February 1994 delivered a 
thought-provoking address at the Chief Ministers' Conference on 
the high priority services that have to be rendered throughout 
the state. She declared that we will make an attempt by the year 
1998 to achieve the target of "education for all" in Tamil Nadu. 
A state-wide effort will be undertaken to see that all children 
are admitted into the schools and also in particular, to make 
sure that they continue schooling until 14. To achieve the 
target, priority will be given to finding necessary financial 
resources. 
  98. To improve the standard of primary education we have 
identified the following steps that should be taken: 

  -  A pre-school education scheme will be implemented all over 
the state beginning in 1994/95. 
  -  During the summer of 1994 a special campaign will be 
undertaken 
to ensure that all children above five are enrolled in the 
schools. 
  -  During the summer holidays and even after the opening of the 
schools, special efforts will be made to see if children are 
continuing in the school. 
  -  The system of educated volunteers teaching those children of 
age six to 14 who had not been to any school will be 
strengthened and made more effective. 
  -  Efforts will be made to improve the quality of the school 
syllabus and training programs for teachers, the system of 
incentives to teachers, improving the minimum educational 
standards, and the participation of parents in the school 
activities. 
  -  On the basis of the recent research survey on infrastructure 
for schools, systems will have to be improved. 

  We will definitely work to implement the plan of action, so 
that the entire elementary education system in our state will be 
of high quality. 
  99. The honorable members of the Assembly are aware that we 
submitted to the World Bank a comprehensive report on a plan to 
upgrade the elementary school system, which is to cost Rs1,200 
crore. The plan is still with the Central Government. We 
requested that the Center send it to the World Bank. Meanwhile, 
we are thinking of a plan for girls' education for which we will 
seek aid from the World Bank. In the districts where the rate of 
girls' education is far below the national average, this scheme 
will help in improving it. The district primary education 
project will be launched in Dharmapuri, 
Thiruvannamalai-Sambuvarayar, Villupuram-Ramaswami Padayachiar, 
and South Arcot Vallallar districts. For a five-year period, the 
allotment for this project will be Rs1,000 crore. This will 
facilitate a large number of girls being enrolled in the primary 
school and encourage them to continue their education. This will 
strengthen the primary school system in Tamil Nadu. 
  100. The honorable members of this Assembly will be pleased 
to know that in the coming year 766 new primary school buildings 
will be completed. After this each school will have at least one 
permanent building of its own. In the coming year we intend to 
build 750 more schools. This will ensure better infrastructure 
for the primary school system. We are asking the Panchayat 
Unions to bring under internal accounting section III the system 
in order to ensure proper maintenance of primary school 
buildings. 
  101. In my last budget speech, I mentioned that new 
legislation will be brought to compel children to go to school 
and continue their education. This announcement was widely 
welcomed. We had discussed extensively the rules and regulations 
of this act. This will be in force throughout the state. It is 
our aim to inculcate in the mind of the parents that it is their 
sacred duty to send their kids to schools. Instead of punishing 
them for not sending their kids to schools, we thought it better 
to encourage them to do it on their own and make them abide by 
social compulsion. The rules and regulations will be implemented 
without any penal provisions. We have the primary school 
facilities to attract the students and educate them; we can 
surely succeed in this task. We will introduce legislation for 
primary education in this session of the Assembly. The honorable 
members of the Assembly will certainly appreciate the novel 
efforts taken for this legislation to bring about compulsory 
education. This, indeed, will be a great gift to our future 
generations. 
  102. The "literacy for all" scheme has been extended to all 
the districts except Madras. For this campaign, a sum of Rs58.26 
crore has been allotted. This will benefit 83.08 million people. 
The campaign is in its last phase, yet such campaigns are the 
ones that cannot end soon. It has to be on a continuous basis. 
Only then will we be able to reap the benefit of our efforts. We 
have to keep a watch over the situation and see that the initial 
enthusiasm of the new literates does not slow down or fade away, 
and we must provide them with opportunities to use their newly 
acquired skills on a continuing basis. We will make sure that we 
will continue this effort. 
  103. We have taken steps to improve the quality of education 
in high schools and higher secondary schools in the state. In 
the coming year we propose to upgrade 25 middle schools to high 
schools and 12 high schools to higher secondary schools. The 
honorable members will be happy to note that the new school 
reform plan that was implemented last year won unprecedented 
support from the public. We have received for this plan in kind 
donations to the tune of Rs76 crores. Just like this effort the 
newly introduced patron of the school project gave us donations 
of Rs4.1 crore. The great support we received from the public 
will greatly help in improving the middle-level school system in 
Tamil Nadu. 
  104. We have decided that the money we received from the 
public should be properly utilized. To construct buildings for 
high school and higher secondary schools, the budget has 
provided Rs75 lakhs. The funds that come from local areas will 
also be utilized for these buildings by collecting donations 
from the public and contributions from the institutions like 
Jawahar employment projects. We propose to have a building 
construction plan in 1994 at a cost of Rs4 crore. Basic 
facilities for the middle-level schools will substantially 
increase further. The syllabus of 14 schools has been designed 
to teach mathematics as well as facilitate intellectual 
development. 
  105. The honorable members of this Assembly are aware of the 
educated volunteer service system started last year. I am very 
happy to announce that there has been great support for the 
scheme, and 15 lakh youngsters have come forward to do the work. 
The work includes enlightening the masses on the importance of 
education, the evil effects of drinking alcohol, etc. This will 
be a great step in the social reform effort. The budget has 
provided Rs13.8 crore. 
  106. The honorable chief minister, the revolutionary leader, 
Dr. J. Jayalalitha, has been giving high priority for the 
development of sports. Within the shortest time, namely seven 
and one-half years, the construction of Jawaharlal stadium was 
completed, and international competitions and 33 national sports 
competitions took place at this stadium. The sports lovers of 
the state will feel happy about the chief minister's efforts for 
the development of sports. In 1995, the next Asian games 
competitions will take place at this stadium. We propose to 
conduct the games in a grand manner, and we have proposed to 
have a scheme costing Rs20 crore. This will help in improving 
the facilities for the competition on the stadium grounds. We 
have also decided to encourage the youngsters in rural areas to 
take training, similar to the Chinese method. Under the scheme, 
388 sports centers, at cost of Rs4 crore, will be constructed. 
For every Panchayat union, there will be a sports center. Each 
center will be set up with an appropriate sports facility hall 
and a 400-meter race track and also a coach. This is a bold 
attempt to attract youngsters to become trained in the skills 
and encourage them to become good sportsmen. In the coming year, 
a sports hostel will be built for well-known sportsmen. In 
1994/95, stadiums will be constructed in Ramanathapuram, 
Sivagangai, and Pudukkottai districts. 
  107. A state committee on higher education was inaugurated 
by 
the honorable chief minister in March 1993. The committee will 
develop schemes for improving education in universities and 
colleges. This will help the universities to upgrade their 
facilities. In 1994/95, a new women's college at Ramanathapuram 
with the budget provision of Rs35.57 lakhs will be started. With 
aid from the World Bank, an education project for technology 
experts is being implemented in the current year. This plan will 
have an allotment of Rs9 crore. This will also help in improving 
55 technology schools. 
  108. At a meeting of the state planning committee with the 
honorable chief minister in the chair, a decision was made to 
integrate the existing intellectual institutions in the 
Tharamani area and to organize an intellectual city at Madras. 
This will promote and foster contacts between the various 
branches of knowledge, facilitate the exchange of ideas, 
establish intellectual contacts with world organizations, and 
organize on a grand-scale intellectual seminars. This is the 
idea behind establishing the intellectual city at Madras. The 
budget has provided Rs1 crore for this project. 
<H5>  Development of Tamil Language and Culture </H5>
  109. The honorable members of this Assembly will be happy to 
learn that the Eighth World Tamil Conference will be held at 
Tanjore on a grand scale. This will commence on 1 January 1995. 
Tamil scholars from various parts of the world will participate 
in the conference. Plans are under way to highlight the glorious 
traditions of the Tamils at this world meeting. Rs1 crore has 
been allotted for the conference. 
  110. As a part of our efforts to preserve our ancient 
culture 
and tradition, the Tanjore Palace building will be renovated at 
a cost of Rs61.90 lakhs and Thirumalai Naikkavn Mahal at 
Maduraim at a cost of Rs79.80 lakhs. The honorable members of 
this Assembly will be happy to note that a substantial amount 
has been allotted to protect and preserve these two great 
monuments. 
  111. We propose to undertake an extensive research project 
to 
organize a new Buddhist cultural wing to be added to the Fine 
Arts Museum in Madras. The new wing will have very ancient, 
priceless relics belonging to the Amaravathi period. On the 
basis of the research, the new art wing will be established. 
  112. To encourage our dramatic groups to organize stage 
performances, we have given them a 50-percent discount on bus 
fares when they travel by bus. 
  113. In order to make all our children learn the Tamil 
language, we have made it compulsory that Tamil be taught at all 
nursery schools in the state. 
  114. We propose to prove with facts and figures how our 
ancient Tamils were engaged in overseas trade and commerce; a 
preliminary report is underway with the help of the National 
Oceanographic Institute. The third stage of this work will be 
completed at a cost of Rs15 lakhs. Later a more detailed 
estimate of expenditure for the project as a whole will be 
prepared. 
<H5>  Family Health Welfare </H5>
  115. For 1994/95, the budget has provided for health and 
family welfare a sum of Rs643.15 crore. The allotment for drugs 
and medicines has been increased from the current Rs75 crore to 
Rs88 crore in the coming year. The budget allocation for basic 
family health welfare in 1993/94 was Rs174.21 crore and in 
1994/95 it is Rs198.95 crore. The Revolutionary Leader Dr. J. 
Jayalalitha mother-child welfare camps have proved to be a 
success. So far 1,315 camps have been conducted and 2.11 million 
women and 2.9 million children have benefited from these camps. 
Having met with success in the camps project, we propose to 
start in June 1994 a project to cover school children of 5-15 
years of age for medical examinations for good health under the 
Revolutionary Leader Dr. Jayalalitha school health camps scheme. 
With aid from the World Bank and UN Children's Emergency Fund, 
we are implementing a scheme to protect babies and promote 
protective motherhood. So far it has worked in eight districts. 
The scheme will be extended to seven more districts in 1994/95, 
namely Madras, Chingelpet-MGR, Coimbatore, Periyar, Nilagiri, 
Tanjore, and Nagapatinam-Quaide Millath. As a part of the effort 
to provide both mothers and babies with hygienic protection with 
an outlay of Rs10.26 crore, the Indian Census V has been 
extended to 15 municipal jurisdictions. This plan allows for the 
provision to the urban poor an integrated service including 
mother and baby protection and also other welfare services. 
  116. In this state there are 1,417 health clinics, which 
serve remote corners and rural areas with maternity health 
services. The members of this Assembly will be happy to know 
that 120 primary clinics will have their own buildings in 
1994/95. The budget has provided Rs7.21 crore for this effort. 
Twelve dispensaries will be built for health centers. 
  117. The main objective of the government is to give high 
priority to hygienic protection to mothers and babies. We have 
decided to implement a special project in the coming year, to 
ensure that every taluk hospital in the state has a new 
pediatric neonatal clinic. As a first step in this direction, we 
propose to reserve beds with necessary equipment and doctors. 
With financial aid from the Tamil Nadu integrated nutritious 
food plan and ONIDA [expansion not given], this scheme will have 
a Rs2.70 crore allotment. 
  118. The honorable members of this Assembly are well aware 
of 
the state's plan to provide every taluk with a hospital with 32 
beds. Under this scheme we have already taken steps to build 
wards in 11 maternity hospitals. I am pleased to announce that 
in 1994/95, the construction of these wards will be completed. I 
guarantee you that hereafter each and every one of the taluks 
will have a hospital with a minimum of basic facilities. 
  119. Villupuram has now become the headquarters of the 
district, we propose to build there a new ward with 48 beds in 
the headquarters hospital. This is a part of a scheme to provide 
every district headquarters hospital with at least 200 beds. A 
budget provision has been made for Rs83.85 lakhs for giving so 
many facilities for these hospitals. 
  120. The health protection scheme will be taken up in the 
coming year for implementation in Dharmapuri, Nagapatinam-Quaide 
Millath, and Tanjore districts. With financial aid from Danida, 
this is to cost Rs89.11 crore. This will help in promoting 
primary health care and supporting the health care system in the 
entire state. 
  121. A World Bank aided prevention of blindness project will 
be implemented very soon. This will help in reducing eye 
diseases from 1.65 percent to 0.3 percent by the year 2000. To 
attain this goal, the district headquarters hospitals will be 
provided with an addition of 1,696 beds and 48 operation 
theaters. 
  122. We have to take steps to prevent and control the cruel 
AIDS disease. We have made necessary arrangements to control the 
disease. We have already given important equipment to 44 blood 
banks out of the already functioning blood banks to ensure 
supply of well protected blood. In the coming year, with support 
from the Central Government, all the blood banks in the state 
will be provided with this equipment. With the aid from the U.S. 
AIDS control project, our plan will be implemented by the 
well-known private sector establishment called the Volunteer 
Health Service in Madras. The plan provides for publicity 
through media contacts to awaken the public about the nature of 
this disease and the way it spreads among the people. 
  123. It has now become crystal clear that with our few 
financial resources, we have to implement programs that provide 
the maximum benefit. The World Bank in its previous yearly 
report emphasized that high priority should be given to projects 
that will reduce the death rate. In order to achieve this, we 
have to promote mother-baby health and welfare, leprosy control, 
treatment for malaria, asthma, and for AIDS control on a high 
priority basis. In the work detailed, modern equipment is needed 
on a large-scale in bigger hospitals. Due to the difficult 
financial situation, we have to collect fees for such new 
facilities. This will ensure that they continue to serve the 
people with their own self-generating resources. 
<H5>  Drinking Water Distribution </H5>
  124. The state government attaches very great importance to 
the task of ensuring supply of protected water for all. The 
budget provision for the supply of drinking water in 1993/94 was 
Rs276.21 crore and in 1994/95 it will be Rs387.72 crore. 
  125. The honorable members of this Assembly are well aware 
of 
our special efforts to combat the drinking water supply problem 
following the north-eastern monsoon rains in 1992. The honorable 
chief minister, revolutionary leader, Dr. J. Jayalalitha, took 
many steps to increase the supply of drinking water in a proper 
way. She was personally involved in checking the progress every 
week. The people of Madras, in a unanimous voice applauded her 
great services to rescue them from a severe water shortage 
crisis. 
  126. The honorable chief minister has taken important steps 
to avoid any such repetition of a water crisis of this kind. She 
made a powerful plea to the executive director and the vice 
president of the World Bank to accede to her request for aid for 
her scheme to increase the drinking water supply to Madras. The 
scheme needs a large outlay. The World Bank agreed to help us. 
The World Bank will undertake in April 1994 to prepare an 
estimate for the scheme's second phase for Madras' drinking 
water purification scheme. The scheme is based on water supply 
from the new Veeranam Lake. We will commence the scheme that 
will bring 40 million gallons of water to the city every day, at 
a cost of Rs720 crore. The budget has provided Rs110 crore for 
this effort. At the same time we are trying to expedite the 
Krishna River water supply scheme. In 1994/95 the budget has 
allotted Rs100 crore for this scheme. Out of this, Rs70 crore 
will be paid to the Andhra Pradesh government, for the work to 
be undertaken on their side. We will carry out the necessary 
construction on our side with the rest of the Rs30 crore. The 
World Bank will evaluate and give an estimate of phase three of 
the Madras drinking water distribution purification scheme in 
April 1994. This Rs751-crore project will supply to the Madras 
area Krishna River water duly cleaned. It will also carry out 
the drainage removal service. The honorable members, I am sure, 
will certainly appreciate the meaningful steps to solve the 
Madras water problem on a permanent footing. 
  127. The Tamil Nadu drinking water supply scheme with World 
Bank aid is being implemented currently at a cost of Rs322 
crore, and this has been extended to December 1994. Under this 
scheme 44 cities have been provided with drinking water. Water 
cleaning facilities were given to 14 cities at a low cost. Rs35 
crore has been allotted for this scheme. The honorable members 
of this Assembly may be aware that schemes to increase water 
supply to Coimbatore, Madurai, and Selam that started in 1987/88 
have met with inordinate delay in implementation. I am happy to 
state that, due to our efforts, those schemes are now about to 
be implemented. In December 1994, there will be an additional 
water supply of 131.25 million liters per day to the Coimbatore 
municipal area, 20 cities, 523 rural settlements and as a result 
22.35 lakhs people will be benefited by the scheme. The water 
supply scheme to Madurai will supply an additional 71.6 million 
liters of water daily, thereby benefiting 12.8 lakhs people. The 
water supply scheme to Selam is about to be completed, and on 
completion this will benefit the Salem municipal area, 268 rural 
settlements with an additional water supply of 88 million liters 
of water per day and benefit 12.93 lakhs people. The water 
supply schemes for Kanjeevaram-Sankaranarkoil have been 
completed. The schemes for Pudukkottai, Thiruvannamalai, 
Manapparai, and Pollachi municipal areas will be completed in 
1994/95. 
  128. In Tamil Nadu, which has 101 municipalities, 99 have 
already been given the basic water distribution facilities. The 
Padmanabhapuram scheme will be completed in 1994/95. For 
Thirutthuraipoondi municipality, a revised scheme is under 
consideration. The schemes for 23 urban area municipalities and 
64 rural Panchayat areas will be completed in 1994/95. 
  129. The honorable members are aware that there are 
different 
views about the actual figures and statistics of rural 
settlements that received protected water supply. We wanted to 
find correct figures, so we took another survey. As per the 
survey of 1 January 1994, drinking water was not provided to 
1,239 settlements. In 1994/95 we plan to give protected water to 
those settlements. As a result, there will not be any single 
housing settlement without protected water. In addition, those 
areas that received only a partial water supply will get a full 
supply in 1994/95. 
  130. We asked the Central Government to grant Rs75 crore for 
the rural water supply scheme in 1993/94, but we got only 
Rs32.68 crore. In 1994/95 the outlay for this scheme, it has 
been learned, will be only Rs39 crore. We intend to ask for a 
substantial increase in the grant, not less than Rs50 crore from 
the Center to enable us to provide water in full measure to 
those settlement areas that received only a partial water supply. 
  131. A big drainage system is being implemented in the 
Coimbatore area. This will be completed in 1995. In the city of 
Ooty, a drainage removal scheme is being undertaken at a cost of 
Rs7.61 crore. Due to the speedy implementation of the scheme, it 
is expected to be completed in September 1995. We have been 
wondering if it is possible to use the funds from the joint 
sector institutions to extend these facilities to an additional 
number of cities also. 
  132. The honorable members of the Assembly know of the 
effort 
this government made to improve the water distribution system in 
the Ramanathapuram District. After reviewing the technological 
and financial problems involved in the matter, we have decided 
to install a desalination plant to transform sea water as 
drinking water of 1 million liters per day at Narippaiyar in 
Ramanthapuram District. This will be implemented with aid from 
the Center. 
<H5>  Welfare of Women, Children and Nutrious Food </H5>
  133. The honorable chief minister, the revolutionary leader, 
Dr. J. Jayalalitha, inaugurating the women's conference on 9 
March 1994, detailed the government's policy on women's welfare. 
This is in fact a bill of rights for women. Under the 
chairmanship of Justice Sengotu Velan, a women's high power 
committee has been appointed. 
  134. Women could enhance their income by getting improved 
training to better their employment opportunities. To promote 
self-employment for women, we have formulated many schemes. 
Through the women's committee we want to encourage 
self-employment opportunities. This will be our plan of action. 
This tactic worked very well in regard to the women's 
development project. This project was recently extended to 
Madurai and Ramanathapuram districts. Under the integrated rural 
development plan this is being implemented as an allied project 
in the rural areas as a women's and children's welfare scheme. 
We have approached the European Economic Community for aid for 
such a plan. We hope to get help from various sources. We will 
integrate all these, and in 1994/95, through self-employment 
schemes, one lakh women will be assured of help to increase 
their incomes. 
  135. The scheme to give financial aid to expectant mothers 
and mothers who breast feed their infants will be continued in 
1994/95 with an additional allotment of Rs6 crore. 
  136. The honorable members of the Assembly are aware of the 
appreciative tributes from all around the world for Dr. J. 
Jayalalitha's 15-point children's welfare scheme, which was 
inaugurated by the chief minister on 14 November 1993. UNICEF 
has hailed this as a fruitful effort and has praised Tamil Nadu 
as the first state to implement a plan of this kind in India. I 
am pleased to announce that we made this plan of action more 
effective and included it as a subsidiary project in the 1994/95 
budget. I am also happy to announce that another subsidiary 
scheme for children's development will be included in the 
1994/95 [budget] with an allotment of Rs697.65 crore. The 
details of the scheme are given below:

  137. Our foremost effort is not merely to just protect the 
life of children, but also to ensure that every child is hale 
and healthy. The honorable members of the Assembly will welcome 
this great effort of our administration. 
  138. The revolutionary leader Dr. J. Jayalalitha's female 
children welfare scheme has received a great welcome from the 
public. The budget has provided Rs4 crore for this scheme. The 
revised scheme gives the following benefits: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  139. While this new revised scheme is continuously giving 
benefits to female children, it also at the same time helps and 
improves family welfare activities. 
  140. For implementing the revolutionary leader MGR [M.G. 
Ramachandran] nutritious mid-day meal program and the allied 
Tamil Nadu integrated nutritious food scheme, aided by the World 
Bank, the budget provision for 1993/94 was Rs312.42 crore; it 
will be Rs345.36 in 1994/95. This highlights the great 
importance we attach to the nutritious food schemes. These 
schemes are being implemented throughout the state in 1994/95. 
Babies from six months to six years will be covered under the 
scheme. This kind of scheme is being implemented only in a few 
states in the whole country. Tamil Nadu is one of the few 
states. The nutritious food is being enriched by adding soya 
flour and corn flour. The honorable members of this Assembly 
will happily praise the steps we have taken to ensure that the 
children in the state get adequate nutritious food. 
  141. The state government has started a 10-point scheme for 
social and economic uplift of the Adi-Dravidas. In the current 
year we have achieved a substantial amount of success under 
various heads of the 10-point scheme, I am happy to report. We 
will continue to implement the scheme. Special areas of the plan 
and goals/targets set for 1994/95 are detailed below: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|8. To provide one light per household |35,000                                | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  142. The main focus of the 10-point scheme is to improve and 
uplift the Adi-Dravidas and Aborigines. 
  143. The honorable members of the Assembly may recall that 
in 
my last budget speech I mentioned a new investment scheme to 
encourage entrepreneurs among the Adi-Dravidas. I am happy to 
announce that the scheme to encourage the Adi-Dravida 
entrepreneurs has come into being. Two industrial estates have 
been started in Coimbatore and Periyar districts, with 100 
industrial sectors. The land for these estates has been 
obtained; land improvement measures have been undertaken. This 
project will cost Rs80 crore. The Tamil Nadu capital investment 
corporation is giving financial assistance for this project. The 
silkworm development plan has given financial aid to 1,097 
Adi-Dravidas. We propose to extend this scheme for 1994/95 also 
and finally give financial aid to 10,000 persons. 
  144. Everybody knows very well that this government has been 
giving importance to the schemes to educate the Adi-Dravidas. 
The special training camps and guides have proved to be very 
effective in the case of students. I am happy to announce that 
the number of Adi-Dravida students who passed the 10th standard 
has increased; it was 57 in 1991/92 and it was 70 in 1992/93. In 
the coming year 200 hostels for students will be started at a 
cost of Rs47.51 lakhs. In 1994/95, additional rooms will be 
added to the already existing hostels. In the budget a sum of 
Rs28.31 lakhs has been allotted to a special fund to provide 
basic necessities for the Adi-Dravida middle-level schools. 
  145. In the four districts where the literacy rate among the 
girls is very low, with the aid of the World Bank we propose to 
start a district primary education scheme. This is just to 
improve the education process among the girls of the Adi-Dravida 
and Aborigines. The Adi-Dravida girls who are poor and are about 
to stop schooling will be encouraged to continue further. A 
special incentive of Rs500 will be given every year for third 
standard to fifth standard. This scheme and the new legislation 
making education compulsory will greatly help children from the 
poor families and Adi-Dravidas and Aborigines to continue in the 
primary schools. To implement this scheme, in 1994/95, it is 
expected that this will cost Rs1.5 crore. These girls will not 
be permitted to continue after the fifth standard, by their 
families. Those girls who want to pursue their schooling, but 
who must stop for want of money, will get Rs100 per month under 
a new scheme we propose to implement throughout the state. The 
scheme is likely to cost Rs3 crore and will benefit 30,000 
Adi-Dravida girls. We are sure that the honorable members of the 
Assembly will welcome this bold venture to directly solve the 
problem of giving education to the Adi-Dravida girls. 
  146. In 1994/95, we propose to implement a new scheme to 
distribute lands to the Adi-Dravidas who are landless, to better 
their economic plight. To facilitate development of land, adopt 
better cultivation methods, volunteer services will be available 
for implementing this scheme. It will take Rs1 crore to 
implement this scheme. This will benefit about 1,000 Adi-Dravida 
families. 
<H5>  Welfare of the Backward Classes </H5>
  147. Due to our great interest in the welfare of the 
backward 
classes, we wanted to protect the quota system in the matter of 
jobs and education by bringing new legislation, and this 
historic bill awaits the consent by the president of our 
republic. 
  148. We are very much interested in promoting educational 
opportunities for the backward classes. For the students of the 
backward communities 604 student hostels are operating now. In 
1994/95, 16 new ones will be functioning. Buildings for 30 
student hostels, at a cost of Rs3.41 crore, are under 
construction. Twelve more will be built at a cost of Rs1.72 
crore in 1994/95. 
  149. Under the housing site deed distribution, in the 
1994/95 
budget a special provision has been made for Rs1.72 crore. The 
qualifying person's limit of annual income has been raised from 
Rs6,400 to Rs12,000. 
  150. We have been giving high priority for economic 
development of the backward communities. The Tamil Backward 
Communities Economic Improvement Association has been revived. 
In 1994/95 this scheme will receive an enhanced allotment of 
Rs13 crore. Help will be given to 10,000 persons. 
<H5>  Weavers' Welfare </H5>
  151. As the price of cotton has gone up considerably, the 
price of yarn has also gone up considerably. The weavers have to 
face such a different situation, and we have to see how we can 
solve this problem. We have told the Central Government that we 
have to take many steps to solve the problem, to help the 
weavers. On our part, we have opened four yarn-selling centers, 
to sell spindles of yarn, etc., at a concessional price. We have 
approached the South Indian Spinning Mills Association (SIMA) to 
give handloom weavers yarn at a concessional rate. To stabilize 
the prices, we have asked the Central Government to arrange 
immediately for import of 50,000 tons of viscose yarn without 
excise duty. We have been pressing the Center to immediately 
solve this problem and help the weavers. 
  152. The honorable chief minister has been keen on 
implementing the scheme to distribute free clothes--dhoties to 
men and saries to women among the agricultural laborers as well 
as urban poor people. For this scheme, the 1994/95 budget has 
allotted Rs46 crore. As it is proposed to get these clothes for 
men and women from the co-optex [cooperative textiles], this 
scheme will help the handloom weavers in our state. This is an 
important aspect of our social security system. 
  153. We have taken many steps to improve the lot of our 
weavers. Everybody has welcomed the scheme we introduced to give 
retirement benefits to the weavers' families. Twenty-two 
thousand, seven hundred ninety weavers have enrolled themselves. 
Still more weavers will be covered under this scheme. The scheme 
to provide houses for the weavers will continue to be 
implemented in 1994/95. One thousand houses will be constructed. 
We have also another scheme to improve the weavers' housing 
colonies. These areas have been provided with 64 bore wells at a 
cost of Rs22.40 lakhs. 
  154. In order to revitalize the cooperative spinning mills 
in 
the state, the budget has provided Rs5 crore. 
<H5>  Labor Welfare </H5>
  155. It is an undisputable fact that the new economic 
policies have paved the way for developing industrial structure 
and reforms. We have been emphasizing that under any 
circumstance we should always be careful to avoid hurting the 
interests of the working classes. Regarding the welfare of the 
working class people in the government sector organizations, we 
have sent action plans to benefit 3,497 persons, at a cost of 
Rs28.97 crore. To cover the expense of the volunteer retirement 
schemes, we have a suggestion made in our note that we should 
get help from the national renewal funds. We will press the 
Central Government to give us permission to proceed further in 
the matter. The laborers who worked in the 12 closed factories 
were given during the Deepavali festival season help from the 
chief minister's general relief funds and this cost Rs32.65 
lakhs. 
  156. In 1993 the industrial relationship was an agreeable 
one. The loss of man-day work hours due to strike and shut-outs 
was 15.56 percent less this year than the previous one. 
  157. We have decided to implement a health scheme for the 
unorganized laborers. This scheme will work through the primary 
health care centers and taluk hospitals. The plan will give 
necessary medicines, etc., and for this scheme the budget has 
provided Rs1 crore. This step is only a part of the integrated 
social security scheme to protect the interests of unorganized 
labor. For the interim relief plan, the budget has provided Rs25 
crore. This is meant to give 50,000 families that have lost 
their bread-winners relief of Rs5,000 for each family. In order 
to provide unorganized laborers retirement benefits, we intend 
to expand the scheme for the abandoned agricultural labor. The 
honorable members of this Assembly will appreciate the steps we 
have taken to provide unorganized labor with social security 
arrangements. 
  158. Under the scheme to fix minimum wages for various kinds 
of industries, we will continue to fix the minimum wages. Until 
now we have brought 67 services under the scheme. The government 
has fixed the minimum wage as not less than Rs20 a per day in 
any kind of work. In 1993, for the first time, the minimum wage 
was fixed for many industries, including peeling of the coconut 
shells, manufacture of foam and other polythene and plastic 
products, carpentry, iron implements-making, and food processing 
works. We revised the minimum wages for cheap smokes work, 
cashew nut, construction work, road maintenance, and carpentry 
in 1993. For agricultural labor we revised the minimum wages in 
1993. We are currently involved in fixing the minimum wage for 
seafood industries. 
  159. We have made substantial progress in eradicating child 
labor. In 1993, action was taken in 44 cases involving child 
labor under the Child Labor Act. This has proved to yield good 
results to keep under control child labor. 
<H5>  Schemes for Loans </H5>
  160. The state government has always been giving great 
importance to speed up economic growth. The honorable members 
are aware of the many notable changes that are evident in the 
financial set up. We welcome the steps taken by the nationalized 
sector. 
  161. We have developed a district loan system based on the 
potential link prepared for every district by the National Bank 
for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). We have taken 
steps to ensure the support of the decentralized district 
development scheme to provide on a district level enough funds. 
The main objective of the scheme is to link local development 
projects with loan facilities and organize them in a coordinated 
manner. 
  162. We have been insisting that the loan to be granted to 
Tamil Nadu not be less than Rs3,000 crore in 1944/95. We have 
particularly expressed our view that funds must be allotted for 
the plantation and irrigation development schemes and other 
schemes. The idea is to secure greater capital investment for 
agricultural development. 
  163. In the past year we revived the scheme for long-term 
loan-giving procedures. In 1991/92, 42 primary land banks were 
eligible to get refinancing from the NABARD. Now 142 banks are 
eligible. The total loan-giving capacity of these banks has 
increased; in 1991/92 it was Rs41.32 crore, and in 1994/95, we 
expect this to rise up to Rs122.57 crore. To improve further the 
capital structure of these primary land banks, we will try to 
get the NABARD's long-term funds for the share capital of these 
land banks. The loan amount for mid-term and long-term 
agricultural needs will be increased. 
  164. In my last budget speech, I referred to the growth of 
job opportunities with a plan of action. In the priority sector, 
we have succeeded in generating more growth. We have been giving 
great support for cultivation of high-priced crops and speeding 
up growth of other areas. We obtained financial aid from the 
NABARD, to give loans to the needy in rural areas. In 1994/95, 
the Jawahar employment scheme will be implemented with an 
allocation of Rs220.59 crore. With the Jawahar employment 
opportunities scheme in the coming year, the total employment 
opportunity will be 850 lakh man workdays, under the assured job 
projects, and guaranteed job opportunities schemes, in 1994/95, 
150 lakh man workdays. Thus in 1994/95, a historic total of 10 
crore man workdays will be achieved. 
  165. The village industry project we introduced to promote 
self-employment opportunities in the villages is working 
successfully. In 1993/94 one lakh workers benefited. This 
project is to be continued in 1994/95, giving the benefit to 
1.25 lakh workers. 
  166. I am happy to announce that the number of jobless 
degree 
holders went down in June 1993 as compared to June 1992, 
according to the employment exchanges office records. So far as 
those who passed the final examination or those who match that 
qualification are concerned, their rate of increase at the 
employment offices is less according to the records. Thus our 
policy regarding employment opportunities has proved to be 
yielding good results. Under the prime minister's scheme for 
promotion of self-employment, 15,000 persons will be given help 
for self-employment. 
  167. We have started the educated volunteer service scheme 
to 
allow the unemployed degree holders to serve in social welfare 
activities. Under this scheme, 1.5 lakh youngsters have been 
enrolled for service. They will be serving in the field of 
non-school education and propaganda campaign to tell the people 
of the evils of drinking. 
<H5>  Government Workers' Welfare </H5>
  168. This administration has been implementing a fair and 
just policy regarding the welfare of those employed in the state 
service. We examined very extensively the requests made by the 
government employees in December last year. In spite of the fact 
the state has been in a very difficult financial situation, we 
granted an interim relief of Rs100 per month from 1 January 
1994, and for the various categories of employees interim relief 
was given. For this important concession, the state has to spend 
Rs120 crore per year. The problem in the matter of government 
employees having to pay professional tax, has been solved in an 
agreeable manner. The travel concession plan to travel up to 400 
km out of the state has been expanded. 
  169. On the basis of the negotiations with the employees 
held 
in December 1993, the health allowance has been raised from Rs15 
to Rs30 per month. On account of this, the government has to 
spend per year Rs10 crore. 
  170. Effective 1 April 1993, the house rent allowance has 
been raised for employees. For this big change, the government 
has to spend Rs33 crore per year. For the cities under stage 1 
(A),(B) stage II towns that are 32.16 km away from the Panchayat 
unions, and stage II towns, the house rent allowance will be 
extended as per stage 1 (A), 1 (B). The demand made long ago has 
thus been granted. 
  171. Regarding the advance granted to buy warm clothes, the 
amount has been raised from Rs500 to Rs1,000 or two months pay, 
whichever is less. 
  172. We have decided that when we raise the pay according to 
the cost of living index for the government employees, those who 
receive honorariums and assignment fees will also receive a 
higher rate. Because of this step, about three lakh employees 
involved in the mid-day nutritious food scheme will be benefited. 
  173. We have decided to start a new department to deal with 
matters relating to the grievances of retired employees. This 
will facilitate the retirees getting their pensions on time. 
  174. This department will work in coordination with the 
Department of Accounting. In the case of the retirees, the 
medical allowance has been increased from Rs15 to Rs30 per 
month, and this will come into effect on 1 April 1994. Because 
of this, the government will have to spend a sum of Rs3.5 crore 
per year.

<F P=106> [Article by Ze'ev Schiff] </F>
  [Text] Should the PLO be helped, how much, and on what 
conditions to assure that the agreement with Israel succeeds? 
That question will pop up and be asked again and again. It is 
not simple, if only because of the emotional baggage trailing a 
body that was regarded until yesterday, and which some still 
see, as Israel's sworn and most hostile enemy. Many people still 
are not convinced that it will not make an about turn and that 
the Palestinians, led by the PLO or another of their 
organizations, will not again seek war against Israel. 
  Many in the right camp want the agreement to fail and put an 
end to the "concession process." They would like to see a civil 
war and bloodshed on the other side. The approach taken by 
others combines scorn with vindictive satisfaction. They say 
that chaos reigns among the Palestinians, that the PLO has come 
in unprepared despite all the pleas that have been made to it 
and that its leaders do not care about the common people. This 
is an arrogant view, as though only Israelis are capable of 
managing independent existence. These people are willing to 
offer assistance to the Palestinians, but from an attitude that 
is paternal and sometimes insulting. Many of these people 
foresee failure and say that no level of aid will help the 
Palestinians, not because they do not want to succeed but 
because they are doomed to fail. 
  Within the Israeli Government, and particularly among senior 
defense officials, a leading, important group contends that the 
little experience we have teaches that there is someone to talk 
to. They are referring, first of all, to the Palestinian 
leadership in the territories, to the police command and to 
prisoners released from Israeli jails (but not to the 
intellectual class). We must show patience, they say; it will 
not be long before the Palestinian system begins to stabilize. 
Of 10, including the prime minister, who spoke at a conference 
held in the Defense Ministry for newspaper editors and other 
journalists, eight used such language or similar terms to state 
that Israel must help the Palestinians maintain the agreement. 
Even the other two speakers did not dissent. They are ready to 
aid the civil administration in particular. More than any 
others, they recognize the difficulties and how unprepared the 
Palestinians are. Still, they explain that this is not just the 
Palestinians' problem, and that failure on the Palestinian side 
is liable to create a problem for Israel, too. 
  This group advances the argument that the Palestinians must 
be helped to maintain the agreement. It is persuading the 
political branch of the need for help in basic matters in order 
to prevent hardship in the territories, which would benefit 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad. Aid is 
sometimes seen in the territories without approval from above. 
Even so, even this group does not concede testing on the ground 
and the need to progress in stages under the agreement. 
  The premise is that along with assistance, every detail in 
realization of the agreement must be strictly observed, that no 
possibility of deviation from the gradual process can be allowed 
and that Israel must react to every violation. Some say that the 
monitoring should be done by those responsible in the 
territories and not by lawyers who, by their nature, are 
inclined to dot every i cross every t. 
  But even as everything is set for inspection, we also cannot 
ignore certain worrisome signs. At the top of the list stand 
'Arafat's statements, which have received extensive coverage. 
'Arafat also stands behind the instruction to break off 
agreements and relations with Israeli companies. That is his 
right, but that also is a formula for increasing hardship among 
residents of the Gaza Strip. Until recently, 'Arafat had led the 
way towards an agreement and blocked opposition to conciliation 
between the two peoples. And now, the new and worrisome line he 
took in his declaration is a continuation of the dispute--not an 
end to it. 
  Some of us are prepared to justify and offer pretexts in 
advance for every PLO violation of the agreement. The discussion 
is not being carried on with them. In any event, they are a 
marginal faction. The discussion is being carried on with the 
Palestinian leadership, which seeks conciliation. When lame 
excuses are heard from them, such as that it was the Kuraysh 
tribe that violated the agreement with Muhammad, and not the 
other way around, so that 'Arafat's statement was correct--it 
must be said that after so prolonged a dispute, there are no 
naive Israelis. Right from the start, even before the ink was 
dry on the signatures, the PLO chairman has been comparing the 
Oslo and Cairo agreements to the truces called by the Prophet 
Muhammed, and it makes no difference at all who breaks the 
agreements. 'Arafat is ignoring the essence of the agreement in 
principle, which speaks of a process towards a permanent peace 
and reconciliation. That is another good reason to make a 
forceful demand for abrogation of the clauses in the Palestinian 
Covenant denying the existence of Israel, as 'Arafat pledged but 
has not done. 
  We cannot forget, however, that Israel has an interest in 
the 
success of the agreement. Otherwise, we would not have embarked 
on this course and the Oslo agreement in principle would not 
have been signed. Therefore, we must help the PLO to abide by it 
and to overcome opponents of the agreement. The main condition 
is an end to the killing of Israelis, and the PLO must make 
every effort to stop it. It cannot be expected that Palestinians 
will kill us and that we will help them or, even more, give them 
financial support.

  [Text] Three weeks after signing of the agreement, there 
still is no autonomy council, and the local administration is 
nearly paralyzed. The police, who are not local, do not know the 
terrain and the people. The Gaza Strip is under total closure 
following the terrorist attacks and even Jericho has been placed 
under a "study closure." But how will they study the agreement 
while their commanders mislead them and announce that Israelis 
are not allowed to travel with arms? 'Arafat adds his own two 
cents and sends out instructions that create legal and 
functional chaos on the ground while blatantly violating the 
agreement, of course. 
  In this situation, no wonder that people are already 
speaking 
of reconquering the Gaza Strip--would that it were not 
necessary. Rabin calls all this "a good start." Why? He let the 
cat out of the bag during his visit to Gaza, revealing the real 
goal and the true test of the process: not an agreement, not 
peace, not even a cessation in terror--but getting IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] soldiers out of Gaza. There were also 
ideological motives such as those of MERETZ (to put an end at 
any cost to occupation rule of another people) and realist 
motives such as those of Rabin (the IDF has failed and we cannot 
go on this way forever; he found no solutions that would not 
require involvement of much of the army in policing the 
territories and denied the political branch any options until it 
was forced to leave, come what may). 
  Accordingly, 'Arafat can declare jihad as much as he likes, 
announce his intention to break the agreement as Muhammad did in 
his time and even violate it immediately in practice (as he is 
doing). We got ours. The IDF has left the alleys of Gaza. 
  Because this is the true test and the basic goal of the 
entire process not only so far as the government is concerned 
but for a large part of the public as well, the question arises, 
was the agreement with the PLO the correct and best way to 
achieve this? Might there have been a better way to reach the 
goal, such as unilateral withdrawal and handing over authority 
to the residents (even without an agreement with them)? 
Comparison of the two options shows that neither assures an 
orderly peace and stability and that terror is very likely to 
continue either way. If and when it becomes necessary as a 
result to carry out the IDF's contingency plans because there is 
no other way to guard the Green Line area except by holding the 
Gaza Strip as a security zone (as in southern Lebanon), it will 
become apparent that we have chosen the worse of the options. 
Indeed, we shall then face not only the inhabitants of Gaza but 
also thousands of armed men--PLO soldiers, released prisoners 
and deportees who were brought back--who would not be there if 
we had chosen the option of unilateral withdrawal. We shall also 
face a population armed with the weapons, the morale, and a 
fighting nation's readiness for sacrifice created by the 
agreement with the PLO. And, of course, we shall face the PLO 
itself, which we have rescued by our own hands from internal and 
elemental collapse and reinforced with support in the most vital 
arena of all: the free world led by the United States. Of 
course, if we had chosen unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, we 
would not be mixed up with Jericho, nor would we ourselves be 
undermining Israel's security doctrine and our consensus 
regarding the Jordan Valley which, like the Golan Heights, is 
almost barren of Arab inhabitants. 
  Even for its goals and means, Israel's government has chosen 
the worse of the two options.

<F P=106> [Article by Wahib Muhammad Ghurab] </F>
  [Text] Jeddah--King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz, Custodian of 
the Two Holy Mosques, two weeks ago laid the final stone in the 
Prophet's Mosque expansion works, thereby completing an effort 
spanning nearly 10 years to give the Mosque its largest 
expansion ever. 
  King Fahd had noted while visiting Medina in 1403 Hijra [H] 
[1982] that the number of visitors to the second most important 
shrine in the Islamic world is constantly rising. He 
consequently ordered a comprehensive feasibility study for a 
mosque expansion that would accommodate the current and future 
needs of the ever-expanding number of visitors, while utilizing 
the area surrounding the mosque. 
  The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques laid the cornerstone 
for the expansion project on a visit to Medina. Actual work on 
the project began the following year. 
  The King underscored his special interest in the project by 
making annual visits to the Prophet's city in order to 
personally monitor the progress of construction and learn about 
any problems that are encountered or modifications and 
supplemental plans that are needed. 
<H5>  The Project </H5>
  The basic elements of the expansion cover a lot more than 
the 
modern enlargement of the original shrine and essentially 
include an extension to the mosque itself; improvements to the 
surrounding courtyards; the construction of restrooms, washing 
facilities, and underground parking facilities; and the 
upgrading of nearby roads and those leading to the shrine such 
as the primary beltway, the Bab-al-Salam highway, and the second 
beltway and its intersections. 
<H5>  Enlargement of the Shrine </H5>
  The shrine itself was enlarged with a main extension whose 
cornerstone was laid by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in 
1405H [1984]. The extension encircles the main mosque and 
connects to it from the north, east, and west. It covers an area 
of 82,000 square meters or five times the area of the original 
building. This brings the mosque's current area to 98,500 square 
meters aside from a marble-covered area of 67,000 square meters. 
The expanded mosque, its interior, and its annexes have a peak 
capacity of a quarter of a million worshippers. This maximum 
capacity rises to a million worshippers when the surrounding 
courtyards are utilized. The expansion project, which has logged 
a total cost of about 30 billion riyals, has required the 
expropriation of more than a 100,000 square meters of property 
in the vicinity. 
  This segment of the construction includes 27 moving domes, 
each approximately 4 meters in height and 14 meters in inside 
diameter, that glide on rails affixed to the extension's roof. 
The open-air areas of the mosque's main hall have been supplied 
with 12 electrically-controlled mobile sun-shades. 
  Also completed during the same stage of expansion were seven 
main northern, eastern, and western gates as well as two others 
to the south. Eighteen escalators handle traffic within the 
shrine. 
  The main entrance to the extension is King Fahd Bin 
'Abd-al-'Aziz's Gate located in the center to the north. The 
extension has seven domes and is flanked by two minarets. The 
expanded mosque therefore boasts 10 minarets, of which six are 
new and rise to a height of 104 meters, which is 32 meters 
higher that their original counterparts. At their height, these 
minarets are probably the tallest in the Islamic world. 
  The extension's interior installations have been decorated 
with designs that duplicate those of the first Saudi expansion, 
including mantels, wrought iron windows and screens, 
copper-inlaid wooden doors, pillar capitals, and gilded 
chandeliers, as well as round and decorative marble works. The 
pillars have special crevices at the base to hold copies of the 
Koran and to accommodate air conditioning vents. 
  Automatic systems control the mosque's lights, sound 
systems, 
and air conditioning. Other systems control emergency lights, 
pollution monitors, and fire detectors. Special rooms contain 
lighting controls, circuit breakers, and distribution consoles. 
This segment of the construction also includes mechanical 
systems for potable water coolers, rain drainage, sewers, 
ventilation of the lower floors, and some of the largest air 
conditioning tunnels in the world. Cooling ducts run along 7 km 
of service tunnels connecting the central air conditioning 
station with the mosque's interior. The air conditioning station 
was deliberately built far from the mosque for several reasons, 
such as sparing more property from expropriation and distancing 
worshippers from the noise generated by the station. 
<H5>  The Mosque's Courtyards </H5>
  That segment of the project sought maximum utilization of 
the 
courtyards surrounding the mosque by preparing them to 
accommodate worshippers as needed at times of peak attendance. 
The courtyards have an area of 225,000 square meters covered 
with marble and granite in colorful and coordinated designs. Of 
the courtyards, an area of 135,000 square meters has been 
designated for prayer and is capable of holding some quarter of 
a million worshippers. This number may be increased to 400,000 
when all the courtyards are utilized. The mosque and its 
immediate surroundings are therefore capable of accommodating 
nearly a million worshippers at peak times. 
  Parking is located directly under those courtyards to the 
north, east, and west. The parking facility consists of two 
underground levels covering a total area of 39,000 square 
meters. This state of the art underground facility has a 
capacity of 4,500 cars and is served by 126 well-equipped stands 
with three driveways leading to the upper level and three others 
leading to the lower level. 
<H5>  Public Roadways </H5>
  The expansion effort also covers the roads leading to the 
shrine, and especially Bab-al-Salam, which is intended to 
provide visitors with fast access to the shrine. It is a 
64-meter-wide dual expressway that is 5.9 meters long, with an 
18-meter extension at its intersection with the second ring road 
[beltway]. 
  The main expressway running in both directions is 
supplemented by two or three service roads in either direction. 
The highway connects Pilgrim City to the west of Medina with the 
holy al-Madani shrine near the Bab-al-Salam gate. The highway is 
supported by vital installations such as bridges and overpasses. 
  The completed expansion works ordered by the Custodian of 
the 
Two Holy Mosques are the most ambitious such projects in the 
history of the mosque since it was founded by the Prophet. 
Future needs have been kept in mind; the extension was 
constructed to support the addition of upper floors, when 
needed, as befits the stature of the second mosque of the 
Islamic world.

  [Text] These days at every congress, seminar, conference, 
academic or nonacademic gathering, or law making or executive 
gathering in our country, and even in private and nonofficial 
public gatherings, the subject of "development" is a 
controversial and ready topic. 
  The slogan "development" can be heard on the lips of every 
real person and legal entity at every social level and class. 
Although the descriptions are not that similar between the 
various economic, social and cultural levels as discussed by 
various people, but all the speakers and theorists acknowledge 
the point that specialist manpower plays a basic and fateful 
role in designing and advancing development programs. 
  There is no doubt that the first step in the training of 
specialist manpower is recognizing the existing gaps and the 
nation's specialist needs, and then guiding the educational 
system to meet these needs. Thus, there is also the need to send 
students outside the country to study and gain skills and 
academic knowledge at higher levels that are compatible and 
appropriate for the nation's specialist needs. Otherwise, 
spending significant amounts of foreign exchange to send 
students abroad will have no result other than to waste the 
nation's capital. 
  On the other hand, in fairness, a student who has passed the 
difficult stages of admission, testing, and selection and goes 
abroad to study will face many problems, despite having special 
resources not available to his peers. 
  The headaches facing the Iranian student abroad include lack 
of familiarity with the system for registration and teaching at 
foreign universities, the difference between his own culture and 
that of the foreign culture, separation from family and friends, 
the timely arrival of foreign exchange stipends, problems with 
housing and settlement, unpleasant treatment by some professors 
at foreign universities, obstacles to spouse employment and 
problems educating children. Add to these things the requirement 
that scholarship students not work abroad, not being aware of 
events in the country, especially the academic and technical 
issues, and the weak connections Iran's educational and research 
centers have with those things, which are a problem because the 
Iranian student usually wants to write his graduate dissertation 
on a subject needed by his country. However, when his repeated 
letters to the domestic organizations to gain familiarity with 
Iran's research priorities go unanswered, it is not clear what 
will happen to his motivation to serve his country. 
  In this report, KEYHAN-E HAVA'I will raise the questions and 
discuss the problems of Iranian students abroad, who make up a 
significant portion of its readership, and give answers from the 
relevant officials. Along with that, it will present the views 
of the experts on how to prepare a statement of procedures for 
sending students abroad. 
  In preparing this report, we have sought to understand the 
problems of students and to discuss them with officials. 
  Because the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the 
Ministry of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education are in 
charge of sending Iranian students abroad, we will begin with 
them. 
  The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education accepted our 
invitation with some hesitation and reluctance. However, 
KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's insistence on the need to study and discuss 
the problems of students abroad ultimately led to a conversation 
with Dr. 'Abdollah Afshar, general manager of scholarships and 
students abroad. He said the reason for this delay was the huge 
volume of current activity. In any case, however, during the 
interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I's correspondent he willingly 
listened to an account of the study and living problems of 
students and finding a logical solution for them, and this 
spirit is praiseworthy in its own right. 
  However, with regard to the Ministry of Health Care, 
Treatment and Medical Education, which is in charge of sending 
students abroad who study in the medical sciences, none of the 
interview formats proposed was accepted, whether in writing, in 
person or orally, and repeated telephone contacts to pursue 
these things got nowhere. Ultimately KEYHAN-E HAVA'I was unable 
to persuade this ministry's relevant officials that answering 
questions from the students under their mantle is a 
responsibility of theirs and a requirement for the successful 
performance of their duties. 
  In the hallways of the second floor of the building of the 
Office of Scholarships and Students, you see a number of 
applicants with papers and documents who are either going from 
one room to another or waiting outside closed doors. This story 
is repeated here every day. It is a tale of minds filled with 
questions, hearts trembling with anxiety and eyes filled with 
hope and expectation. Sometimes an individual becomes offended 
with the repeated fruitless coming and going, forgets about 
being patient, and fills the hallways with his cries for all to 
hear. 
  In the office of Ms. 'A., an angry man with a disturbed face 
addresses her sitting behind her desk. She repeats her daily 
experience--being silent and giving clients an opportunity to 
express their anger. He says: Madam! What is my brother to do, 
empty-handed in a foreign country? You sent him, you must also 
pay his expenses. Must I abandon my work and my life for several 
days and go up and down the stairways in this building to get 
someone to listen to me, to get an official to take the trouble 
to listen to me and believe me? 
  When this man's rage gradually subsides, who is concerned 
about the fate of his brother living far outside the country, 
the experienced staff worker explains: Your brother changed his 
major without getting authorization, and according to 
regulations, the result of doing this is a cut-off of the 
regular foreign exchange stipend. 
  The man, now speaking in a milder and humbler tone, answers: 
Dr. ...is familiar with the situation. In the university where 
he was accepted, this major is not taught. The foreign professor 
did not cooperate with my brother. He was forced... 
  Before he finishes, Ms. 'A. interrupts him imperiously: In 
any case, your problem concerns Mr. S. 
  In Dr. A's office, an agitated woman frantically tries to 
persuade Dr. A's secretary to permit her to see him for just two 
minutes. 
  The secretary lady explains to her that client meetings with 
the doctor are absolutely impossible without a written 
recommendation from one of his assistants. Apart from this, your 
husband's file must be studied in the council. 
  The answer is this: Dear lady, the file is in the council. 
Our problem will be solved with just one signature. My husband 
has been waiting for the council's answer in Canada for two 
months now. He calls me every day wanting to know what has 
happened. For the last 15 days I have been wasting my time 
morning and afternoon in this office. I do not even have that 
much time to submit my own final master's degree letter. 
  We ask her, what is your problem? 
  She says: My husband was accepted in the examination to be 
sent for the doctoral program in chemistry in Canada, but 
because of a delay sending him, the deadline passed for 
registration at the intended university, and if he is to wait 
until the next registration period, he will be delayed until 
next September (Shahrivar [23 August-22 September]). After two 
months, however, the relevant council still has not issued 
authorization for him to change universities. 
  Then she immediately asks: Aren't higher education officials 
concerned about the budget money that will have to be spent 
through next September to support my husband in Canada for no 
reason? 
  Here, one person is complaining about receiving foreign 
exchange without studying, another is complaining because he has 
no money to study! 
<H5>  Failure of Foreign Exchange Stipends To Arrive on Time; </H5>
Student Worries 
  Dr 'Abdollah Afshar, the Ministry of Culture and Higher 
Education's general manager of scholarships for students outside 
the country, was asked about the fact that the failure of 
foreign exchange stipends to arrive on time sometimes brings 
students to the brink of expulsion from the university, and how 
long this problem will continue to plague the students. He said: 
We know that students are under pressure because of this, and 
perhaps 80 percent of the worries of students living outside the 
country have to do with the fact that their study expenses do 
not arrive on time. However, due to the complex mechanism and 
the crippling bureaucracy in higher education, there is not that 
much room to maneuver to change the existing situation, even 
though 20 percent of the time this problem may arise for 
students due to malfunctions in this ministry. 
  Most of the problems, however, have to do with other 
organizations such as the Central Bank, the Plan and Budget 
Organization, the postal system, the foreign banks, and other 
organizations. For example, at the beginning of the year 1373 
[21 March 1994] we were supposed to send a six-month foreign 
exchange stipend to the students, but it takes about three 
months for the budget guidelines for doing this to reach us and 
the Central Bank, and until these guidelines are given to the 
Central Bank, the banks will not be authorized to pay the 
foreign exchange. 
  Dr. Afshar discussed the solution adopted to make up for 
this 
three-month delay procuring the needed foreign exchange. He 
said: We have selected a definite solution to the students' 
problem. We have allocated $1 million in emergency funds to the 
six student supervisory offices outside the country (Australia, 
England, Russia, France, Canada, and India). We have told the 
supervisory offices that they may solve the students' financial 
problems temporarily by paying them funds until the foreign 
exchange stipends are procured, and these funds will be 
deposited in the account of the supervisory offices to replenish 
the emergency fund. In practice, however, this insignificant 
emergency fund will not solve the problem of 2,900 scholarship 
students and 800 students receiving foreign exchange.

  He discussed the work flow of the task of procuring foreign 
exchange within the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. He 
said: A study report approved by the relevant supervisory office 
is examined by the ministry's academic consultants, and if the 
academic level is acceptable and if the documents are complete, 
a foreign exchange letter is issued and sent to the ministry's 
financial affairs office. Despite maximum effort by the 
departments involved in the ministry to issue the foreign 
exchange letter for the students in the shortest time possible, 
continuation of the task is the responsibility of other 
government organizations. 
  The general manager of scholarships and students discussed 
the foreign exchange letter's movement through the 
administrative pipeline in organizations outside the Ministry of 
Culture and Higher Education. He said: One of our biggest 
problems is the slowness of student foreign exchange procurement 
in the banking system and the fate of many foreign exchange 
letters is tied to the volume of the work and the accumulation 
of current work in the draft-issuing branch of the bank. 
  He said the delay of foreign exchange drafts in foreign 
banks 
is another factor in the foreign exchange reaching students 
late. He added: In many cases significant amounts of foreign 
exchange written as drafts for Iranian students remain in 
foreign banks for two to three months and reach the students 
after significant delays. 
<H5>  One Student Living Abroad--20 Students Inside the Country </H5>
  With a thumbnail count and an accounting of the wages of 
professors and current expenses in Iran's universities, we come 
to the conclusion that the educational expenses of each doctoral 
student inside the country is one-twentieth that of a student 
abroad at this level. That is, with the budget that the 
government spends for the education of a doctoral scholarship 
student outside the country, one could cover 20 students inside 
the country. Based on the same calculations one can say that the 
living expenses of a student with spouse and children added to 
the university tuition, airline ticket, and other educational 
expenses of a student in a country such as America, Canada, or 
England at the doctoral level averages more than 20 million 
tumans. If this sum were put into the bank as a fixed deposit, 
its profits would permit the hiring of three university 
professors with monthly salaries of 80,000 tumans. 
  In the interview with Dr. Afshar we also estimated the 
doctoral expenses at universities abroad and compared that with 
domestic costs. We reached the same conclusion, that the cost of 
going through a doctoral program outside the country is about 20 
million tumans, and the same program inside the country is 1 
million tumans. 
  Concerning the enormous cost to the government of study 
abroad, Dr. Afshar said: We pay the tuition at foreign 
universities separately. In addition to that, in many cases we 
also assume the cost for the equipment and laboratory supplies 
the Iranian students use in the university laboratory, as well 
as student research expenses. 
  Also on the expense row for students studying abroad is the 
annual payment of about $200 to $300 to buy books, as well as 
some money for student insurance. 
  Due to the requirement of marriage, the foreign exchange 
stipend for a student includes the student's living expenses in 
addition to 60 percent additional for a spouse and 30 percent 
more for each child (up to three children), and all of these 
expenditures will be paid as of the beginning of the year 1373 
[21 March 1994] based on 1,750 rials [R] per dollar. This sudden 
leap in the foreign exchange rate from R70 to R1,750 has brought 
great pressure on the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education. 
  For example, a student residing in london, having three 
children, will receive a monthly stipend of 350 pounds, based on 
each pound being equal to 2,640 rials, will receive R2.310 
million per month in stipends alone (or 231,000 tumans), and 
this is only part of the expenses of students living abroad. The 
expenses also include tuition, research, laboratory supplies, 
book budget, student insurance and round trip transportation. 
  If we multiply these expenses by 2,900 scholarship students 
and 800 students receiving foreign exchange, we arrive at 
astronomical figures, which bear no relationship to the amounts 
committed and submitted as security deposits by the scholarship 
students. For this reason, under Note 40 of the current year's 
Budget Law, we must transfer some of them to the nation's 
domestic universities and for the others whose studies are about 
to be completed, we must convert their deposits and commitments. 
  Note 40 of the 1373 Budget Law says: Authorization is given 
to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and the Ministry 
of Health Care, Treatment and Medical Education to transfer 
students receiving foreign exchange to domestic universities and 
institutions of higher education and to take the rial 
equivalents of the foreign exchange funds allocated each year to 
each student for tuition. The equivalent of the foreign exchange 
mentioned in this paragraph at R1,750 will be given to the 
relevant universities and institutions of higher learning. 
<H5>  Sending Abroad Only for Doctoral Programs </H5>
  With a look at the statistical tables on the distribution of 
those admitted in masters and professional and specialist 
doctoral programs in universities inside the country, it becomes 
evident that admissions of students at the graduate levels have 
increased in recent years. 
  Based on statistics provided by the Statistics Center of the 
Higher Education Research and Planning Institute, in the 
1363-1364 [1984-1985] academic year, a total of 3,356 people was 
admitted in the masters and professional and specialist doctoral 
programs in the country's domestic universities and centers of 
higher education. 
  Admissions of students for final studies in the 1370-1371 
[1991-1992] academic year rose to 8,137 people in the six 
academic groups of medicine, humanities, basic sciences, 
technical and engineering, agriculture and animal husbandry and 
art and architecture, and this figure shows growth of about 110 
percent. 
  In view of the daily, increasing capabilities of the 
nation's 
domestic educational system, the basic question is, is the need 
to send students abroad still felt with the same with depth and 
intensity as in the past, or has this feeling begun to subside? 
  Based on all the studies we have obtained in the course of 
preparing this report, the nation's experts and executive 
officials are leaning towards reducing the number of students 
sent abroad. This inclination becomes stronger each day for 
three major reasons: 
  1 - The heavy financial burden and the enormous budget 
required to send students abroad in the wake of the unification 
of the foreign exchange rate. 
  2 - Improved quality and increased capacity of the system of 
higher education inside the country. 
  3 - The undesirable consequences of the outrageous cultural 
difference between Iran and the host countries, especially in 
view of the fact that the requirement of marriage for sending a 
student abroad has caused the young children of Iranian students 
to be exposed to the bad effects of this cultural difference. 
  Mohammad 'Ali Ramin has a masters degree in general 
mechanics. He recently completed his studies in Germany and 
returned to the country. He hesitantly evaluates the success of 
sending students outside the country. He says: Western culture, 
in proportion to the moral and behavioral capacity and assets of 
students, has negative moral effects on them. Therefore, in 
selecting scholarship students the greatest care and careful 
observation must be employed so that people will go abroad to 
continue their studies who have sufficient awareness and ability 
to face the cultural dangers. 
  He advises students being sent abroad to take a 
comprehensive 
approach to studying abroad, to try to benefit from all the 
academic and research dimensions of the universities, and to 
avoid taking a one-sided, one-dimensional and limited view of 
things. 
  He said it is undesirable for the student to get into a rut 
without being aware of the various aspects of an issue, and that 
the doing so is merely a quest for credentials, rather than 
knowledge. He added: In Iran the whole goal of sending students 
abroad can be summarized in one idea, and that is to procure 
faculty for universities. Some of Iran's students put all their 
effort and energy abroad into getting credentials, because they 
know beforehand that when they return there is a professor's 
chair waiting for them and that they will have to teach, rather 
than do research and experiments. 
  Explaining his views, he said: If higher education is not 
related to the nation's various sectors, which are involved in 
work and applications, especially the industrial ministries, and 
if the student is not made to understand that he is being sent 
abroad to solve the problems of industry and to find the missing 
links in the production chain, the student will not benefit from 
his efforts or enjoy the fruits of the privations of exile, nor 
will the country benefit from his knowledge. Consequently, the 
costs and energy expended for this purpose will be wasted. 
  We discussed this idea with Dr. Afshar. He said: In the 
goals 
for sending students abroad, priority goes to completing the 
faculties at universities. The universities under the mantle of 
the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education convey their 
academic needs to the ministry (the deputy minister for 
education) and the Student Evaluation Organization conducts the 
examination for sending students abroad with the country's needs 
in mind. 
  We asked Dr. Afshar how the need for specialist and skilled 
manpower is met in the industrial and agricultural sectors, 
although we knew that the responsibility for answering this 
question is not with the General Office of Student Scholarships. 
However, we found it useful to ask this of Dr. Afshar because of 
his university teaching background and his executive 
responsibility's connection with the subject. 
  He answered: Unfortunately there is the problem that there 
is 
no one body responsible for planning to meet the entire nation's 
specialist needs. The current procedure is that each 
organization and ministry estimates its needs, which may be 
exactly the same as the needs of another organization, and this 
estimate becomes the criterion for the work of the Evaluation 
Organization in selecting students. Sometimes some bodies and 
offices illegally send a scholarship student abroad directly 
after choosing people from among their employees, although the 
Law on Sending Students Abroad requires all ministries and 
bodies to do this only through the channel of the Ministry of 
Culture and Higher Education. 
  Dr. Afshar discussed the negative consequences of the lack 
of 
a central committee or council to plan for sending students 
abroad and make decisions about all the nation's academic needs. 
He said: The consequence of the lack of centralization in 
identifying needs and existing gaps in the country is that we 
send so many students in some fields that we become saturated 
and have no labor market for them. On the other hand, we forget 
about some essential fields. In some cases we also send students 
abroad (based on the announced needs of the ministries) when 
there is sufficient ability and resources inside the country for 
their education in that field. 
  The general manager of scholarships and students abroad 
presented statistics on students sent abroad in the year 1372 
[21 March 1993-20 March 1994] based on the various educational 
groups. He said: Of the 600 people we sent abroad last year, 271 
were admitted in the technical and engineering sciences, 131 in 
the basic sciences, 73 in agriculture, and 125 in the 
humanities, arts and architecture. 
  He added: According to the plan, last year we were to have 
sent 900 people abroad. However, after the establishment of 
higher level programs inside the country in many university 
fields, we transferred 300 of the ones admitted to domestic 
universities, and they also welcomed this decision. 
  He mentioned Canada, England, Australia, Russia, France, the 
Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, India, Germany, New Zealand, and 
Belgium as countries admitting students sent abroad in 1372 to 
their universities. 
  Dr. Afshar discussed the procedure for selecting the country 
and the college and making the final designation of the field of 
study, academic concentration and the facilities created in this 
regard to send students abroad. He said: After the admitted 
students take language examinations and achieve the minimum 
scores, the students are sent to the Academic Consulting Center. 
  He discussed the history of the formation and the 
responsibilities of the Academic Consulting Center. He said: The 
members of this center, who began their work about two years 
ago, are chosen from university professors and graduates in 
various fields from various countries in the world, so that in 
addition to having sufficient specialist knowledge to identify 
the specialist tendencies in the academic fields, they will have 
sufficient familiarity with foreign universities and their 
academic level so they can give all the needed information to 
the student. 
  Dr. Afshar discussed the criteria used to select foreign 
universities from which to obtain admission. He said: The 
academic consultants have two criteria for selecting a 
university: First is the academic level and the quality of 
teaching, and the second is the extent of concentration of 
Iranian students at the university. 
  Based on Dr. Afshar's comments, attention to the extent of 
concentration of Iranian students at the target university is 
important because a concentration of students of one nationality 
in a class creates an unbalanced atmosphere in the class and it 
is highly likely that side issues such as political matters will 
have a negative effect on the mastery of the subject by students 
of the majority nationality. 
<H5>  Change of University, Major, or Academic Concentration </H5>
Prohibited 
  Opposite the Office of Guidance Experts Asian Department, we 
spoke with a woman who was waiting for authorization for a 
40-percent airline ticket discount for her brother's permanent 
return from India. 
  She discussed her brother's study situation. She said: He 
went to India to continue his studies after receiving his high 
school diploma in 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985] (before the 
enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad). After the 
enactment of the Law on Sending Students Abroad, he submitted 
commitments to the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education and 
sent his academic performance report and was grouped with the 
students receiving foreign exchange. After receiving his 
bachelor's degree in chemistry, he changed his major and took up 
the study of pharmacology. When he completed his bachelor's 
degree in pharmacology, he decided to return to the country 
after living in India for 10 years, due to the fact that his 
foreign exchange ration was cut off. 
  When I said good-bye to that lady I wished her brother 
success in using his academic knowledge to serve the country, 
but I asked myself if it would not have been possible to obtain 
bachelor's degrees in chemistry and pharmacology inside the 
country, instead of this dear compatriot spending 10 years of 
his life away from his family and his motherland, spending 
enormous amounts of foreign exchange during that time. Here I 
did not think it was that fair of the woman to complain that her 
brother's study foreign exchange was cut off after he completed 
his bachelor's degree in pharmacology and he was forced to 
abandon his studies, because in Iran every year hundreds of 
participants in the national university admissions examinations 
are (continuously) admitted at various levels in the field of 
chemistry and in pharmacology doctoral programs. 
  On the other hand, changing one's major from chemistry to 
pharmacology raises the question, wouldn't it be better if the 
students being sent abroad made a final decision before going 
about their future employment and study? 
  Perhaps in answer to this very question, the Ministry of 
Culture and Higher Education set strict regulations prohibiting 
scholarship students from changing their university or major. It 
will no doubt be useful and enlightening to mention some of 
these regulations for Iranian students living outside the 
country: 
  Permission to change the previously chosen university 
outside 
the country will not be given except in exceptional 
circumstances. 
  The Ministry of Culture and Higher Education absolutely will 
not agree to changes in majors or academic concentration, 
because the country is in need of that same designated major and 
concentration. 
  The scholarship student may not change his host country 
under 
any circumstances. 
  The maximum period designated for the student's residence 
outside the country may not be extended except in special 
circumstances, with the agreement of the relevant supervisor and 
the approval of the Foreign Exchange Council. 
  The subject of the thesis of students in the humanities must 
be chosen from among issues specifically pertaining to Iran. 
<H5>  Theses: Solutions to Problems, or Useless? </H5>
  Now that the subject of regulations on theses in the 
humanities has been raised, it is not a bad idea for us to seek 
the views of a number of graduates of foreign universities. 
  Dr. Hoseyn Gharibi, chief of the National Center for 
Documents and Academic Credentials, who studied in England, 
recommended a kind of balance and two-sided policy. He said: The 
view that the subjects of all graduation theses of students 
studying abroad must be determined from within the country and 
there should be no freedom for students living outside the 
country is of questionable benefit to the country, because on 
the one hand we need the new techniques and on the other hand we 
want new technology to determine the country's needs. 
  Continuing, Dr. Gharibi discussed some of the consequences 
of 
requiring students to choose their subjects domestically. He 
said: One of the things a student living outside the country 
needs to do research on domestic subjects is statistics and 
information from Iran. In view of the fact that the student is 
working under the supervision of a foreign professor, sometimes 
it is not in our interest to send information about the country 
without controls. According to Dr. Gharibi, great care and 
delicacy must be exercised in sending out information for 
research to be done outside the country and using the views of a 
foreign professor concerning domestic subjects. 
  In this regard Dr. Afshar explained that up until six months 
ago, the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education had no 
restrictions on theses. He said: After studying the theses of 
students living outside the country we concluded that much of 
the research, especially in the humanities, not only has no 
benefit of any kind for Iran, but also the situation is such 
that the theses are prepared with Iran's financial support and 
information and then, because they have nothing to do with the 
nation's domestic issues, are presented to the foreigners on a 
silver platter. While Dr. Afshar was talking about submitting 
Iranian student theses to foreigners, I remembered a friend's 
account of his memories of studying in a foreign country. He 
said: An Iranian student in my class studying library science 
wrote his thesis on how foreign students can better make use of 
the library's academic resources...in that country. 
  However scientific, useful and new they may be, the results 
of this research will help only those who go to that library in 
that same country, and such research does not solve any of the 
problems of the thousands of book lovers and seekers of 
knowledge inside the country. 
<H5>  Reciprocal Expectations </H5>
  Just as the officials expect, Iranian students take their 
country's priorities into account when choosing the areas of 
their research. Graduate students outside the country also 
expect not to have problems getting their academic credentials 
accepted inside the country. 
  One of those reporting to the Office of Student Scholarships 
said that he took the examination to be sent abroad for the year 
1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990], with a bachelor's degree in 
physics from the Tehran Teacher Training College, and passed it 
successfully. He said: I began studying for a master's degree 
outside the country in the field the Ministry of Culture and 
Higher Education selected, and after that I went through the 
doctoral program with the academic concentration chosen by the 
Ministry of Culture and Higher Education's consultants. Now, 
however, after returning, this ministry's Office of Graduates 
refuses to accept my academic credentials. 
  He asked unhappily: Why is there no coordination among the 
offices affiliated with a single ministry? Why are they saying 
the credentials in the field they themselves chose for me are 
not accredited? 
  We asked Dr. Afshar the reason for this lack of 
coordination. 
  He confirmed the existence of this malfunction and said the 
reason is the adoption of separate and individual policies by 
two general offices affiliated with the ministry. He gave the 
good news, however, that with the formation of the Scholarships 
and Foreign Exchange Council, which has decisionmakers from both 
offices as its members, this lack of coordination will go away. 
  He added: The members of the Scholarships and Foreign 
Exchange Council identify and designate accredited and 
acceptable universities, and on this basis students are sent 
only to countries where the academic credentials of their 
universities are accredited with the Office of Graduates. 
  The formation of the Scholarships and Foreign Exchange 
Council to coordinate the designation of fields of study and the 
evaluation of academic credentials is praiseworthy, but it 
appears quite necessary that a council be formed to coordinate 
the sending of students with the missing links in the chain of 
production aimed at self-sufficiency. This is an important and 
fateful step upon which Dr. Afshar insisted in his interview 
with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I. It is a step that could take us to a place 
where in the nation's Five-Year Plan we could design a model 
organization made up of the needed experts, and we could send 
students abroad to fill the empty slots in this model 
organization.
