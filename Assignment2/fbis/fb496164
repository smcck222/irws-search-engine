<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hajj Isma'il, chief of Palestinian </F>
police in Jericho, by Mahmud Husayn in Cairo; date not given: 
"We Are Trying Hard To Avoid Clashing With Armed Settlers, Will 
Take Measures To Regulate and Control Appearance of 
Weapons"--first paragraph is AL-SHARQ introduction] 
  [Text] Palestinian police forces assumed civil powers in 
Gaza and Jericho on Wednesday. Palestinians took over 
administration of their own affairs for the first time. How is 
the Palestinian police planning best to perform its missions? 
How will it deal with citizens and with settlers at the same 
time? Colonel Hajj Isma'il, chief of the Palestinian police 
forces, throws light on the future duties of the Palestinian 
police in the following telephone interview with our AL-SHARQ 
bureau in Cairo. 
  [Husayn] What missions have been assigned to the Palestinian 
police? How do you feel now that the Feast of Sacrifice has 
arrived with the police forces among their own people in Gaza 
and Jericho for the first time? 
  [Isma'il] First I send my greetings to all people in the 
Arab 
homeland on the occasion of the Blessed Feast of Sacrifice. I 
send these greetings from the liberated land of Palestine and 
the brave city of Jericho. We send expressions of love and 
esteem to all who contributed and helped the Palestinian people 
return to their land and home. Greetings to the whole Arab 
nation from the Atlantic to the Gulf! 
  As for the duties of the police, since their arrival, the 
civilian police forces have assumed normal duties as usual in 
the territory, especially in the Jericho area. The forces have 
begun to execute all their duties to provide security and safety 
and maintain order. Affairs here in Jericho are proceeding 
normally and as usual. The Palestinian police are running 
affairs in accordance with the operational program they have. 
  [Husayn] What is the situation of the settlers in the Gaza 
and Jericho area? Do you expect disturbances to be fomented 
during the operation of the Palestinian police forces? 
  [Isma'il] We have worked hard from the beginning to avoid 
getting into problems with the settlers, particularly the 
religious ones. The Jews have a small synagogue in the Jericho 
area. One of the agreements was that the religious should be 
allowed to frequent this synagogue once a week or at any time 
they wish, but on condition that they not be armed. The 
religious are insisting on entering the synagogue with their 
weapons and are refusing to be bound by the agreement. They are 
giving us trouble and problems. They also are going through the 
city. We are trying hard in liaison with the Israeli side to 
overcome the problems. We are still suffering from this problem. 
The religious settlers are still behaving provocatively. 
  [Husayn] What about the return of refugee Jericho residents 
to their lands from Jordan? 
  [Isma'il] There are large numbers of Palestinians living 
completely on Jordanian soil and receiving much attention in 
Jordan. They are now waiting for arrangements to be made to 
implement the agreement on a return of the refugees. They will 
have priority in returning to their country. Special committees 
will begin in this context to discuss the return of the 
refugees--joint Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian committees and 
joint Israeli-Palestinian-Egyptian committees. 
  [Husayn] What about Palestinians visiting Jerusalem, given 
the ban that Israel is imposing? 
  [Isma'il] The Israeli position remains the same regarding 
visits to Jerusalem by residents of the Jericho area. We are 
suffering from this difficulty. We discussed the subject last 
Wednesday with the Israeli side. The Israeli position still has 
not changed on this subject. 
  They insist that anyone who wants to visit Jerusalem must 
obtain a permit. We have informed them that Jerusalem is part of 
Palestinian territory. We shall soon visit Jerusalem. We are 
working to break the blockade and lift the measures that the 
Israeli side has imposed on Jerusalem. 
  [Husayn] What preparations are being made to receive 
Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in the Jericho area? 
  [Isma'il] We in the West Bank and Gaza are eagerly awaiting 
the arrival of Chairman Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and earnestly 
preparing to receive him. The timing of the arrival has been 
left up to the chairman. He will be among his people and 
friends. We welcome him warmly among the people of his homeland. 
  [Husayn] What about supervision of the King Husayn Bridge 
entering and leaving Jericho, as well as the passage linking 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip? What is the situation of the police 
forces regarding these two crossings? 
  [Isma'il] There are agreements on the subject. The Israeli 
side is building the installations necessary for traffic on the 
three crossings. The Israeli side will soon finish setting up 
the designated stations, and we shall then begin to implement 
all measures concerned with the process of entering and leaving 
the corridors in accordance with the provisions of the agreement 
on the subject. 
  [Husayn] Would you tell us something about the deployment of 
the Palestinian police forces and the duties assigned to them? 
  [Isma'il] As soon as our forces reached the Jericho area, 
they moved to secure and safeguard public installations. We are 
working hard to assure public order and provide protection to 
citizens. When we arrived, we began to provide protection to all 
institutions, so that they can operate normally. Tourism as 
usual has returned to Jericho. All civil institutions are 
working regularly. We also took swift steps to restore control 
of traffic in the city and of public utilities in cooperation 
with people here. We are witnessing great joy among our people 
who lived under the occupation and those who have returned from 
the diaspora. The whole country is filled with joy. Jericho will 
be a step toward the return of all our lands--until the flag of 
freedom shall fly over them. We are working hard to make Jericho 
a brick in the edifice of our independent Palestinian national 
state. We ask the Arab states to support the Palestinian people, 
so that we can restore the infrastructure that we received in 
ruinous condition from the Israeli army of occupation. 
  We are working to build a modern state. This requires 
support 
from the Arab and Islamic nation. 
  [Husayn] What measures are the Palestinian police forces 
taking with regard to the issue of arms proliferating in the 
hands of civilian citizens in Jericho? 
  [Isma'il] We for our part will take measures to guarantee 
and 
control the weapons phenomenon in a way that protects the 
dignity of citizens and the dignity of the homeland. We expect 
close cooperation from citizens with the police. We have no 
troubles on this subject in Jericho, since everyone favors 
stopping the circulation of any illegitimate and illegal weapons.

<F P=106> [Interview with Fatimah al-Barnawi, chief of Palestinian </F>
women's police, by Nabil al-Baradi'i in Tunis; date not given: 
"We Will Not Be a Repressive or Overbearing Police, but a 
Security Service in the Civilized Sense!"--first three 
paragraphs are AL-HAWADITH introduction] 
  [Text] Palestinian Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has appointed 
Fatimah al-Barnawi chief of the Palestinian women's police in 
the self-rule area of Gaza and Jericho. 
  Fatimah al-Barnawi is an activist who spent 121 months in 
prisons of the Israeli occupation. She is married to the 
activist Fawzi al-Nimr, who himself spent 15 years in the 
prisons of the occupation. 
  The following discussion took place in an interview with 
Fatimah al-Barnawi. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] When did you begin to be an activist? 
  [Al-Barnawi] In my early childhood I used to see Israeli 
attacks on Palestinians. I had no explanation for them. In 1948, 
we migrated from Jerusalem to Jordan and lived in the camps with 
other Palestinian emigrants. After three years I could bear it 
no longer, so I returned to Palestine and stayed with my father. 
I learned nursing and worked with the relief and Palestinian 
refugee employment agency in the city of Qalqilyah, which in 
those days was in ruins after the tripartite attack on Egypt in 
1956. The Palestinians who were under arrest in the police 
station died martyrs' deaths in the attack on the city. 
  The city of Qalqilyah was attacked again in 1963, when they 
destroyed the wells because of their importance to a city 
dependent on agriculture. Orchards dried up and agriculture 
suffered. Israel attacked the city again in 1965, destroying the 
gasoline pumps to paralyze traffic and make an impression on the 
residents. Naturally, the solution was to turn to the United 
Nations, which merely criticized, while Israel continued its 
attacks. The situation is the same today; nothing has changed. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Was it the passivity of the UN resolutions 
that 
made you think of militancy? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Faced with such a dark reality, I began to feel 
that I was wronging myself by not being politically educated. 
Our reactions were merely emotional. Without a militant 
organization we lacked political consciousness. My zeal 
increased when Israel attacked and occupied the Gaza strip in 
1956. I wanted to perform any act that would be a reply to 
Israel's repeated aggression against our people, particularly 
since I saw the dead and wounded by virtue of my job as a nurse. 
So I joined a group of young people, and we began working 
together--secretly, of course. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Did you carry out any militant operations as 
part of this group? 
  [Al-Barnawi] There were some Egyptian soldiers who had come 
from Egypt to help us. Some of them were wounded and were wanted 
by the Israelis. I, my sister, and three young people tried to 
smuggle them out of the city of Qalqilyah. We gave them clothes 
to replace their Egyptian army uniforms, which we burned, and we 
enabled them to escape. But an Israeli doctor at the hospital 
became aware of the operation and alerted the Israeli soldiers. 
  After questioning, although I utterly denied the charge 
against me, I was dismissed from the hospital. I began to work 
with the Palestinian people under trees and in homes, nursing 
the wounded and giving aid. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] How did you join the Fatah movement? 
  [Al-Barnawi] I became acquainted with a group from the 
Palestinian National Liberation Movement, or Fatah, which was 
headed by Yasir 'Arafat--he was then called Abu-Muhammad--and I 
joined them. 
  After they inducted and trained me, they asked me to carry 
out an operation involving planting explosives in a movie house 
called Cinema Zion. The choice of the movie house was not 
arbitrary. It was chosen first because it was in Jerusalem--for 
the symbolic significance of the city. Next, there was the 
attitude of the shows in the movie house, which presented films 
about the spurious Six Day War and sold cassettes pushing 
Zionist ideology and calling for strengthening and expanding the 
Israeli occupation at the expense of the Arabs. Before you ask 
about civilians being present in the theater, I say that the 
Israelis all are soldiers--even their civilians are reservists. 
Thus, we did not target civilians. The theater was full of the 
Israeli army. I carried out the operation in company with my 
sister, who was five years younger than I, but had joined Fatah 
before me. There was also brother Fathi Shahrur, who was an 
official in the organization. During the same night other 
operations were carried out, and they all succeeded. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] How were you arrested? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Although my dark complexion played a great part 
initially in making the operation successful and throwing the 
Israeli soldiers off the trail, they finally caught up with me. 
Thinking that I was an Ethiopian, they contacted the Ethiopian 
embassy and confirmed that no young Ethiopian girls were in the 
area. Meanwhile I had returned to Qalqilyah. When they went to 
the house and found neither me nor my sister who had carried out 
the operation with me--Abu-'Ammar had enabled us to escape--they 
arrested my mother and two of my other sisters. Of course they 
tortured them. It had not been hard to find the house, because 
Palestinians of African ancestry live in one neighborhood near 
al-Aqsa Mosque. They caught up with me two days later. They 
encircled the house where I was staying with a group of girls, 
because the Israelis thought I was a dangerous, muscular woman. 
When they saw me, they were surprised that I was young and 
slender--I was no more than 25 years old. The girls raged 
against them because they did not know what I had done. The 
soldiers told me to put on the shoes I had worn the day of the 
operation. I knew they wanted to get evidence to condemn me, so 
I changed shoes. They took me. In the prison they left me with a 
female guard whose daughter had been present in the movie house 
that the operation targeted. Although I was handcuffed and she 
was armed, she was afraid of me. I made movements to provoke 
her, so that she would become even more afraid. On entering the 
prison, I saw many dark-skinned girls standing waiting for the 
perpetrator of the operation to be brought in. When they saw me, 
they ran up to me saying, "Confess, because we are in prison 
because of you--and your mother, too." I answered them that 
every one had to bear her own responsibilities, and that I had 
nothing to confess. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Why didn't you run away after carrying out the 
operation? 
  [Al-Barnawi] I lacked experience. When I returned to 
Qalqilyah, I did not know that the Israelis were searching for 
me. I couldn't even comprehend what I had done. Like other 
sisters, I had watched the struggle of Algerian women. We had 
seen the film "Jamilah." My entire hope was to make some 
response, even a small one, to the Israeli actions. I did not 
think of running away. Even when Abu-'Ammar sent a message to 
the house asking us to leave the place as a precaution, I was 
not present when the message arrived. Because the operation had 
been secret, I could not reveal what I had done to anyone so 
that they might advise me what to do or how to behave. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Tell us how they questioned you? 
  [Al-Barnawi] First they tried to make an impression on me. 
They reminded me of my African ancestry, trying to convince me 
that I had no connection to Palestine--to mislead me, of course. 
I replied that I knew nothing about Nigeria; I knew only 
Palestine, where I had been born. I belonged to Palestine, not 
to a country I had never visited and about which I knew nothing. 
On the next day, they told me that I had been in the movie house 
and had been carrying explosives. I admitted that I had been in 
the theater, but denied carrying explosives. They did not 
believe me and threatened me, saying that they would make me 
confess everything. They summoned a powerfully built blond 
soldier carrying a whip. The fellow was roaring; he was no 
normal person. I asked them what was wrong with him. They told 
me that the poor fellow was of German origin. The Germans had 
killed his family, and I now wanted to kill him! I told him that 
I had never gone to Germany to kill him; rather, it was he who 
had come to take my house and attack me. 
  Of course they tortured me. They tortured my mother in front 
of me to influence me. The rule was that if we were caught and 
forced to confess, we were to confess only against ourselves and 
mention nothing about others. If we confessed, we were to 
mention the reasons: we were to say it was because they had 
dispossessed our people and occupied our land, while we had 
previously coexisted with the Jews. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] What about the trial? 
  [Al-Barnawi] The trial was in a military court. It lasted a 
week. They appointed Zionist lawyers for us, who tried to 
convict us more than defend us. Instead of defending me, the 
lawyer would ask before the court about the depth of the 
impression the explosion had left. 
  The lawyer had promised my father to get me out of the 
court. 
I rejected him. I said that anyone who lied to my father and 
promised him something he could not do could not be trusted with 
my case, and I rejected him. In convicting me the court relied 
on a discussion that took place the day I was arrested, when the 
girls became enraged with the soldiers who took me. To calm 
them, they claimed they were going to take me for only 10 
minutes. I had replied to them, "Just say 10 years!" They 
insisted that if I had done nothing, I would not have expected 
10 years in prison. Before that, they sent a lawyer to me to 
offer me release from prison in exchange for a confession before 
everyone, including foreign reporters and observers. I was to 
express my regret for what I had done, because I had been misled 
by the Palestinians and had been influenced without holding 
convictions. However, what happened was the opposite. Along with 
those who had carried out the other operations, I insisted that 
we were not guilty and not sorry, because we were in the right. 
Israel was the aggressor, and we had responded to it. They 
sentenced me to 10 years in prison for belonging to an illegal 
organization, life in prison for possessing weapons, and another 
life sentence for carrying out the operation. In other words, I 
was to die [in prison], wake up, and die again! 
  [Al-HAWADITH] How was prison life? 
  [Al-Barnawi] We were subject to a strict regimen. Although I 
was the first woman prisoner from Fatah, I found two Palestinian 
women prisoners who must be mentioned. One was imprisoned five 
years before me. She was working with the pro-Syrian al-Ard [the 
Land] group and was in charge of passing information to the 
group. This prisoner was a wonderful worker with her hands. When 
she refused to give the Israelis any information, they sentenced 
her to six years in prison. The second was the activist Nayifah 
al-Mawji. She was from the area of Galilee occupied in 1948. She 
helped me a lot. Although she was not in the same cell with me, 
she would raise my morale by writing a note and passing it to me 
when she went by my cell. She told me to be strong and patient. 
She also told me that there was no death penalty in Israel--the 
Israeli papers were publishing my picture with a noose around my 
neck to intimidate and terrify me and anyone who wanted to 
resist the Israelis. These newspapers would get into the prisons 
through the Israeli women prisoners. Because the Israelis 
refused to consider us political prisoners, they threw us in 
with women drug smugglers, thieves, and prostitutes--into a 
world of depravity and crime. They knew no fear. Whenever 
activists carried out any commando operation, the Israeli women 
prisoners, instigated by the women jailers, would take vengeance 
on us. My teeth were broken in one of the attacks. When I made a 
complaint against them, the woman lawyer Felicia Langer came. 
They accused me of attacking one of them and of having broken my 
teeth by biting her! 
  There is also a work system in the prison. Anyone who 
refuses 
is forbidden to go out for sun and air. The jobs to be done were 
kitchen work, gardening, cleaning rooms and toilets, ironing the 
clothes of Israeli women soldiers, and embroidering clothes in 
the Palestinian style for sale. Since the latter amounted to 
theft of our heritage, we used to refuse to do it. I worked in 
the kitchen for eight and one-half years. It was hard, tiring 
work that went on without a break from eight in the morning to 
four in the evening. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Besides the newspapers, did you read anything 
else? 
  [Al-Barnawi] We were prohibited from reading political and 
educational books. We were only allowed to read worthless 
sentimental books. However, a year and one-half after I entered 
prison, we were joined by some educated Palestinian 
sisters--about twelve activists who helped educate their less 
informed and less educated colleagues. We used to talk 
surreptitiously during the hour in the sun, and we would meet in 
furtive attempts to organize recreational and educational 
programs inside the prison. The Israelis tried to stop these 
programs. Whenever they saw one of us happy or glad, they would 
put her back into her cell before the hour was up. They wanted 
to see us always sad, worried, and depressed. When we protested 
about the shortening of the rest interval, they answered that 
they were not bound to a schedule and that we had to submit to 
their orders. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Did they talk to you in Arabic? 
  [Al-Barnawi] They spoke Hebrew, and we had to learn it 
through the women jailers who had lived in Arab countries. Those 
women had maintained some Arab customs. Those who came from Iraq 
were devoted listeners to Nazim al-Ghazzali, and everyone had to 
listen when he sang. The Yemeni Jews hold their weddings in the 
Yemeni style. They would drum on a pot, use henna, and wear Arab 
clothes, just as if they were in Yemen. The Israelis do not have 
a unified culture. To go back to the women jailers from Arab 
countries--they were set to guard us precisely so that they 
could understand what we were saying with our families during 
visits. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] How long did your mother and two sisters stay 
in prison? 
  [Al-Barnawi] My sister was imprisoned for a year. My other 
sister and my mother remained without sentence for two months, 
just to take vengeance on me and pressure me. The Israelis 
usually destroyed prisoners' homes, but they were unable to 
destroy our house because it was next to al-Aqsa Mosque. My 
father died while I was in prison. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] And after you left prison? 
  [Al-Barnawi] They expelled me. They let me off at the 
Jordanian border, where there were brothers waiting for me. They 
did not inform the Red Cross. I returned to the revolution and 
contacted the PLO again to continue my activities. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Was your life sentence lifted? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Exile is crueler than prison. Although we have 
been accepted and treated as guests by Arab countries like 
Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen, and Sudan, we yearn to return home. In 
Tunisia we were accorded every sort of hospitality by the 
generous Tunisian people, and we felt comfortable in this 
beautiful country. But that does not prevent us from thinking 
about regaining our land, rejoining our kin, and beginning to 
rebuild, even inch by inch. All expelled Palestinians feel that 
they are guests and that they must return to their lands that 
they left against their will. I take with me a good memory of 
Tunisia. It was here that I married another expelled activist 
who had carried out militant operations and was sentenced to 15 
years in prison. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] When did you go to Tunis? 
  [Al-Barnawi] After leaving prison in 1967 and being banished 
to Jordan, I went subsequently to al-Biqa' and south Lebanon. I 
went to Tunis in 1983. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] What is your position on the peace agreement? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Our people have become weary as a result of the 
daily siege imposed by the Israelis and the prohibition on 
workers pursuing their jobs. We did not carry on these 
negotiations by ourselves: all the Arab brothers and all the 
Arab countries agreed to them and participated in them. Just as 
Israel occupied our land bit by bit, so we shall regain it in 
the same way. When we are on our land, we can struggle. The 
struggle of the Palestinian people can be considered one of the 
most difficult of struggles. Our Algerian brothers, for example, 
resisted French occupation from within, on their own land; but 
we are scattered and dispersed to all parts of the world. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] What do you feel when you remember the 10 
years 
you spent in prison? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Ten years and a month! They were not in vain, 
but have begun to bear fruit. I do not consider myself to have 
given anything. Those who really sacrificed are the martyrs of 
Palestine. As for me, I was imprisoned and came out. Palestine 
is worth our giving our lives. If I gave 10 years of my life, I 
am not sorry. Returning to Palestine compensates me for my 
entire life. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] How did you receive the decision of your 
appointment as chief of the Palestinian women's police? 
  [Al-Barnawi] In fact, I knew about it because Faruq 
al-Qaddumi had spoken to me, saying: "A decision will be issued 
appointing you as chief of police. You are the only one capable 
of carrying out this mission. All the Palestinian leaders are 
happy about the decision. It is an honor for you, sister 
Fatimah." While I was away from Tunis, my husband Fawzi 
al-Nimr--by the way, he is an activist who has experienced the 
two most bitter things in Israeli prisons--contacted me and told 
me about the decision. My feeling was a mixture of joy and fear: 
joy at the confidence that Abu-'Ammar and the entire Palestinian 
people have accorded me, with constant telephone calls from 
inside and outside the occupied territories to congratulate me 
on the new position; and fear that the new task may be too great 
for my ability. However, with God's help, I will succeed and 
prove to the whole world that Palestinian women are capable of 
working and carrying on in all fields. I am now as happy as can 
be. I am very glad that I shall be serving the general good, the 
good of the Palestinian people. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Will your experience in Israeli prisons have 
an 
effect on your new job? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Of course. The experience will have a positive 
effect. I have learned a lot from my prison term and how the 
women jailers treated us. I learned the meaning of mercy and 
humanity and how much they affect the spirit. I learned the 
meaning of injustice and cruelty. All this naturally will have a 
positive affect on my work. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] Do you expect many young Palestinian women to 
show an interest in joining the police service? 
  [Al-Barnawi] Yes, I get telephone calls every day from 
inside 
the country, particularly from young women expressing a great 
desire to join. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] What qualifications must young women have in 
order to join the police? Do you intend to bring in women who 
have been released from Israeli prisons to work in the women's 
police? 
  [Al-Barnawi] The idea of women's police usually implies 
women 
who are large, powerful, and mean tempered. We are an exception 
to this rule. We will choose educated young women and guides who 
have compassion and good characters. We will make the women's 
police service an educational school and put the right person in 
the right place. We will not be a police of repression or 
overbearing, but a security service in the civilized sense, so 
that we prove that we are fit for this job and others. 
  [Al-HAWADITH] When will this service go into operation? 
  [Al-Barnawi] It is not easy for us to begin from nothing. 
First, I have asked Yasir 'Arafat that there be contact with our 
Tunisian and Jordanian brothers, so that we can profit from 
their experience in this field. I am pleased with the young 
women who work in the security service, for I see them 
constantly. As soon as we enter Palestinian territory, we shall 
begin to accept young women and send some of them to enroll in 
the military academy in Tunisia, Jordan, or Egypt.

<F P=106> [Article by Moshe 'Ishon: "The Battle for Jerusalem"] </F>
  [Text] Jerusalem has arrived on our agenda. We can no 
longer avoid a discussion of this question. The facts 
established on the ground by the PLO require a prompt reaction, 
including deeds, so as not to leave an opening for 
clarifications two or three years hence that might jeopardize 
the integrity of the City of David that has been reunited. 
Israeli policymakers must know and understand that what is not 
accomplished today they will not be able to accomplish at the 
time of the discussions on the final agreements between Israel 
and the Palestinians. It is no longer possible to sweep under 
the carpet the basic disagreements that separate Israel and the 
Palestinians. In fact, Yasir 'Arafat repeated his clarification 
that he is leading the way to the liberation of Jerusalem from 
the hands of the "Zionist conquerors." He also appointed a 
special minister for Jerusalem affairs. Recently Faysal Husayni 
declared that "we will open additional political institutions in 
Jerusalem." 
  The PLO is not satisfied with "Orient House," which has 
become the focus of international political activity. This 
organization is seeking to set up further centers in the city in 
order to demonstrate, by so doing, PLO sovereignty, without 
considering Israeli warnings nor the unequivocal declarations 
that all of Jerusalem is the capital of Israel for eternity. 
  Under these circumstances it is "time to do" in order to 
foil 
the PLO plots aimed at redividing the City of David and setting 
up the capital of a PLO state in it. This is the time to declare 
to the PLO leaders that under these circumstances Israel will be 
forced to void the agreement she gave upon the signing of the 
Oslo accord, that it is the legislative and administrative body 
of the Autonomy, or more correctly of the sovereign Palestinian 
entity in Judea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. 
  From the beginning it was a mistake to agree that the 
Palestinian residents of Jerusalem would be permitted to vote 
and be elected to the entity that engraved on its flag the 
redividing of the city. Furthermore, the government also did not 
stand by its initial obligation that the residents of East 
Jerusalem would not be permitted to be elected to the 
Palestinian authority. They would only be permitted to 
participate in the elections via ballot boxes that would be 
placed outside Jerusalem, such as in Ramallah, Bethlehem, etc. 
Thus the first concession led to further concessions. It caused 
complications that are some day likely to seriously affect full 
and complete Israeli sovereignty over the city of the kingdom 
and the Temple, toward which the eyes of all Israel are raised 
in prayer and belief that it is ours for eternity. 
  But we will not dwell on mistakes connected with the past; 
we 
will turn our attention to the facts on the ground that should 
alarm us to dangers lying in ambush at the entrance to the 
eternal capital of the people of Israel and the State of Israel. 
Indeed, there exists a broad national consensus among the people 
of Israel and in the diaspora on everything connected to the 
integrity of Jerusalem. However a consensus alone is not enough. 
If it is not accompanied by deeds, it has no value. When the 
time comes, it also will not save us in the great struggle for 
Jerusalem. 
  Nowadays, when Israel still rules in Judea and Samaria and 
the Palestinian entity is restricted to Gaza and Jericho, we 
have the strength in our hands to determine on the political 
battlefield everything connected with the integrity of Israel. 
That will not be the case when the sovereign Palestinian entity 
expands to the gates of Jerusalem and its environs. Then we may 
no longer have the upper hand. It is thus better that things be 
clarified already now, before we approach implementation of the 
second phase of the "Oslo Agreement", by which all the 
"conquered territories" will be transferred to Yasir Arafat's 
command. 
  Lately, we have gotten better at recognizing the head of the 
PLO and his intentions with the entry of the "Palestinian 
police" into Gaza and Jericho. The leaders of the Palestinian 
police declared upon entering those cities that they were headed 
for Jerusalem in order to establish the capital of Palestine 
there. Because words are not enough for them, there is no choice 
but to stop them while they are still at the start of their 
journey. 
  In this connection it is important to pay attention to the 
words uttered this week by Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of 
Jerusalem, on the program "Popolitiqa" on Channel 1 of Israeli 
television. He said unequivocally that "Orient House" must be 
shut down because this house has turned into a focus of 
anti-Israeli political activity leading to a redividing of the 
city. If Teddy Kollek has come to that conclusion, despite the 
fact that he is not considered a part of the "radical right," 
nor one of the faithful of the "whole Land of Israel," it is the 
duty of the prime minister and the members of his government to 
pay close heed to these words. 
  The government also must not be permitted to turn a blind 
eye 
to the PLO flags flying over East Jerusalem, nor to the offices 
that this organization is hurriedly erecting while ignoring 
Israeli authority and law. 
  Yasir 'Arafat responds by waving the letter in his hand 
containing the Israeli obligation to discuss the future of the 
city, but there is nothing in it to prevent the Government of 
Israel from removing the PLO and its political institutions from 
East Jerusalem. Israel is the owner of the entire city, 
including all its subdivisions without exception, even those 
populated by Palestinians. There is no other sovereign beside 
her. And a sovereign must behave as required in order to prevent 
the establishment of facts on the ground that contradict laws 
existing since the unification of Jerusalem. 
  Israel must demonstrate her sovereignty over all 
subdivisions 
of the city. We must also stop giving "good advice" to "tour 
guides" to fold up the Israeli flag when they arrange excursions 
for tourists and others in the eastern part of the city. 
  Whosoever folds up the national flag of the State of Israel 
in East Jerusalem only encourages those who have evil designs 
against her to fly the Palestinian flag on the main road of the 
City of David. 
  Moreover Israeli authorities are, for some reason, ignoring 
the close connections between the Palestinians in East Jerusalem 
and the sovereign Palestinian entity in Jericho. Those ties 
augur no good for united Jerusalem. Thus they must be stopped as 
quickly as possible. 
  The battle for the integrity of Jerusalem is but an 
inseparable part of the large battle being waged meanwhile 
behind the curtains around the question: Will an independent 
Palestinian state arise between the Jordan and the Mediterranean 
Sea alongside the State of Israel? The campaign is not easy, 
especially after the Rabin government signed the agreements with 
the PLO that contain no clear and unequivocal answer to the 
question: Where is the State of Israel headed? 
  The government preferred, for some reason, not to discuss 
now 
the tough issues, as they are termed by those involved in the 
talks with the PLO, since discussing them would likely destroy 
the agreement. 
  It is hard to understand what Rabin's brain trust gained by 
avoiding the tough issues. They certainly brought no profit to 
the people of Israel. Wittingly or unwittingly Israel has played 
into 'Arafat's hands and enabled him and his entourage to strike 
a stake for an independent Palestinian state in large parts of 
the Land of Israel. The are exploiting the agreement to get set 
up in the field, to establish as many facts as possible, each of 
which is consistent with the clear Palestinian intention to 
establish a sovereign country within the next two to three years 
under Arafat's presidency. 
  As is his wont, 'Arafat is repeating the things he said 
secretly in Johannesburg and is now declaring openly that he is 
following in the footsteps of the founder of Islam, Muhammad, 
who, in his day, voided an explicit agreement that he had signed 
with members of the tribe of Quraish. In other words, the PLO 
does not see itself obligated by its agreement with Israel, and 
when the time is ripe, it will announce its nullification. And 
we will be left holding that same piece of paper. Yet there are 
those among us who congratulate themselves that there has been a 
breakthrough on the road to peace... 
  There has been no breakthrough on the road to peace. There 
has been a breach in the wall protecting unified Jerusalem. If 
we do not go up on those walls to strengthen them in order to 
prevent the enemy from redividing the eternal city that the 
people of Israel have clung to for thousands of years, then 
Jerusalem is likely to become a "sacrifice" on the "altar of 
peace" that the Rabin government set up by signing the agreement 
with Yasir 'Arafat. 
  It is not enough to declare that the Palestinians can forget 
Jerusalem. In order for them to forget Jerusalem, we must 
remember well the oath of the generations of David, king of 
Israel: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, may my right hand be 
forgotten." 
  Whoever does not remove Jerusalem from his heart, cannot, 
must not be permitted to go on with his daily agenda while 
ignoring what is happening in the eastern part of the city. He 
cannot ignore the increasing political activity in "Orient 
House," which continues to function with no interference. 
Certainly he cannot reconcile himself to the establishment of 
further facts on the ground, as expressed by the opening of PLO 
political institutions on the outskirts of the city that is 
entwined with the lifeblood of Israel from days of yore, since 
King David purchased it from the Jebusite. 
  But the Rabin government is conducting a policy of amnesia. 
On the one hand it remembers Jerusalem and swears loyalty to 
her. On the other hand it forgets what it must do to preserve 
the integrity of the City of David. It declares day after day 
that Jerusalem will not be divided. At the same time Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres passes along a letter to the head of the 
PLO in which he promises that "there is something to talk about" 
even on the issue of Jerusalem. Not just that but he even 
attached a copy of his Knesset speech in which he referred to 
Jerusalem in order to placate the PLO. 
  In light of all the above, there is a growing fear that the 
Rabin government is not at all excluding the possibility of 
concessions, even in everything having to do with the integrity 
of Jerusalem. What Rabin does not say aloud, his "poodle" Peres 
says in public. According to him, a functional compromise can be 
reached on a political rather than physical division of 
Jerusalem. A wall will not be built, but the city will be 
divided between Jews and Palestinians. 
  But, despite the efforts of the government to avoid actions 
to prevent the establishment of PLO facts in Jerusalem, it 
cannot hide what is happening there from the eyes of the public. 
  The people of Israel remain faithful to the oath of 
generations not just not to forget Jerusalem but, in the end, to 
raise its voice to force the government to act immediately for 
the peace and integrity of Jerusalem. 
  If we remember Jerusalem and concern ourselves with her 
integrity, only then is there a prospect that the Palestinians 
will be forced to forget Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. 
  Seek the peace of Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Article by Ya'aqov Edelstein] </F>
  [Text] Britain, which previously canceled the ban on 
selling oil to Israel, has announced that she is lifting her 
embargo on buying Israeli arms. The embargo was imposed by the 
European Community in 1982 after the IDF's [Israel Defense 
Forces] invasion of Lebanon, but most EC members had long since 
rescinded the ban. Britain left it in effect, insisting that the 
IDF withdraw from the security zone. Although Britain has lifted 
the prohibition on buying arms from Israel, she has not actually 
bought any weapons because of the embargo. 
  Why are the British more extreme in this matter than the 
other European countries? It may be that the answer to this must 
be sought in the remote past, when Britain conducted policy in 
Mandate Palestine by calculating the worth of relations with the 
Arab states and the Arab world. It was a question not of 
principle but of practical considerations. The reason given for 
the recent decision to lift the embargo was the positive 
developments in the peace process in the Middle East, 
"especially in light of the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and 
Jericho." The decision was made following an extended lobbying 
visit by Rabin, Peres, Beilin, and their assistants. Beilin, who 
met with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, told him that 
Britain's decision to maintain the embargo so long as no 
progress occurred in the negotiations with Lebanon, was absurd 
because such progress depends on Syria. Moreover, Israel made 
clear that she has no territorial demands on Lebanon. 
  We glean from these events that Britain lags behind European 
nations in her conservative policy. This is also fundamentally a 
pro-Arab policy, to the point of imposing conditions for every 
development in relations with Israel. The British seem to forget 
that Israel no longer is a land under the control of the British 
Government, or that Britain cannot dictate how she shall conduct 
policy. The technique of imposing "collective punishment" on 
Israel for one policy or another is pointless. Britain cannot 
impose an economic embargo on another government simply because 
its political considerations differ from those of His Majesty's. 
  The British Government has taught us another lesson at the 
same time. Prime Minister John Major refused to accept the 
Jewish community's invitation to take part in an evening devoted 
to Jerusalem on Jerusalem Day. His secretary justified that on 
the ground that Britain does not recognize and, indeed, rejects 
Israel's annexation of Jerusalem. Short and sweet. This is a 
community that sought to be honored by honoring the man who 
serves as the prime minister and, in the end, was honored by his 
disgrace. The festive dinner was held in a synagogue in 
Jerusalem even without a speech by Prime Minister John Major.

<F P=106> [Article by Uzi Bar'am] </F>
  [Text] The organization of some esteemed members of the 
Labor Party into a group offering a third, alternative political 
course is of interest and worth study. They contend that between 
the "conservatism and close-mindedness of the right camp" and 
the "capitulation of the left camp," there is another 
possibility: the Alon plan. 
  Yig'al Alon conceived his plan in the late 1960's. It was 
based on a chain of Jewish settlements in vital areas of the 
occupied territories and on military control of the mountain 
ridges. This plan, which early on won broad support in the Labor 
Party, has now been pulled out of mothballs even though the 
conditions that gave birth to it have changed. 
  If a genuine, bold and clearheaded leadership had arisen in 
the early 1970's and opened a real dialogue with Jordan and the 
PLO, it might have been possible to realize some elements of the 
plan. Today, after the peace agreement with Egypt, which 
included total withdrawal from Sinai, and given our readiness to 
achieve a comprehensive peace with Syria--at the price that 
entails--the Alon plan is no longer viable. It is now a 
political corpse irrelevant to our times. 
  The simple, salient question before us is, are we ready to 
make peace with Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Palestinians or 
not. That is it in a nutshell. I am aware of the public's gut 
feeling--peace yes, but not at any price. But the price is 
clear: total withdrawal from the Golan, withdrawal from most of 
Judea and Samaria except for Jerusalem, and the possibility that 
a Palestinian state will arise as part of a permanent 
arrangement. The compensation for that is a comprehensive peace 
agreement with the confrontation states around us, with defense 
arrangements acceptable to the military and security branches 
and a different, optimistic outlook for Israel's future 
development. 
  These are the only two paths before us: Greater Israel with 
perpetual war and rule over another people, or peace with major 
and painful territorial concessions. 
  The whites in South Africa could have worked out a shared 
government and rotation in office with the black majority 20 
years ago. The apartheid leaders closed their hearts and minds 
and ended up with full control by the black majority, something 
that could have been prevented by a wise and balanced approach. 
  In the basic elements of the dispute and in its solutions, 
the case of South Africa necessarily is not identical to the 
Middle East. But the comparison is applicable to determinism of 
historic processes. Rule over a foreign people, even if it is 
justified, has a price. Yesterday's price is not today's and 
certainly will not be tomorrow's. Whoever tries to use 
yesterday's plans today will pay the price tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Article by Karim Subhi: "Saving People From Torture"] </F>
  [Text] The question was: What are the real motives behind 
establishing a medical center to rehabilitate those who escape 
from torture? What is its goal? 
  Dr. Susan Fiyad, one of the center's founders and a 
specialist in psychological and nervous disorders, says: "The 
idea was formulated during my extended practice in several 
government psychiatric hospitals. During that time I treated 
many victims of torture whose missteps cost them a mixture of 
torture, abuse of dignity, and psychological humiliation, from 
which they emerged broken in body and spirit. 
  "One of the things that affected me strongly was that 80 
percent of these people were basically honest citizens. They 
were true victims. Therefore, I personally found that they had 
lost much of their confidence, either in themselves or in 
others. They came to us to receive the treatment they required 
for any nervous disorder. As for psychiatric illnesses, which 
are feelings of confusion, debility, low self esteem, 
depression, and inability to fight or overcome the crisis, these 
disorders continue to lurk and strongly impede their internal 
equilibrium. 
  "One example that I was involved with, and that I'll never 
forget, occurred when one of those patients who had been 
tortured in a police station sensed an air of trust between me 
and him, and began to tell me his bitter experiences. 
  "The young man had been working as a karate instructor. He 
resigned from his job in a national organization and opened a 
mechanic's shop. One day a dispute broke out between him and a 
police officer. The latter induced some of his colleagues to 
arrest the young man. He was tortured in a police station with 
the most repugnant forms of degradation and attacks on his 
dignity, in front of his wife and children. In only four hours, 
the life of this young man collapsed completely and his 
situation was completely reversed, especially when he was unable 
to restore his honor and dignity by any legal means. 
  "He suffered from depression, dissociation, chronic pains, 
sexual debility, feelings of guilt, and loss of confidence in 
himself. He said: `I used to lump you together with those who 
tortured me, but now I don't.' That case required three years of 
medical and psychological treatment until I was able to 
rehabilitate him." 
  Dr. Susan Fiyad continued: 
  "This is one example out of hundreds of shocking cases of 
which we know little. They live among us like time bombs, and we 
know nothing about them. They are cases of mental and nervous 
disorders, to whom the general practitioner, or even the 
experienced psychiatrist, is unable to offer real, effective 
help. 
  "Moreover, they require very special methods of therapy, 
over 
the short- and long-term, by a specialized medical team that is 
qualified to deal with these disorders. This is precisely what 
cannot be provided in the government hospital. 
  "Therefore we as doctors are aware of the dire need for such 
a specialized center to rehabilitate victims of violence and 
torture without restriction or conditions as to the identity of 
the victim, the reason for the attack, or its source." 
  I asked Dr. 'Abdallah Mansur, one of the center's founders: 
Do you have statistics that indicate the number of torture 
victims we have? 
  "No, they are not available, but it is certain that the 
victims number in the thousands, because we don't mean just 
torture victims in detention camps or police stations, but 
rather those who are subjected to family torture and abusers, 
including men, women, and children. However, at the present 
time, the concentration is on shock cases [al-halat 
al-sarikhah], in view of the project's newness. Dealing with 
those types of victims began only six months ago. Despite the 
newness of the specialty and the center, the number of patients 
exceeds 50 cases. Most of these people were subjected to torture 
in Egyptian police stations, or are Palestinian or Sudanese 
detainees, who were released and who came to use of their own 
accord or through Amnesty International." 
  What are the methods of treating torture victims? 
  Dr. Susan Fiyad replies: "The primary goal of the treatment 
is to rebuild the personality, so that he can again become 
responsible for his life. Therefore we keep the patient from 
recalling his previous experiences as much as possible. The 
therapy is both physical and mental at the same time. Natural 
therapy also forms an important part of the physical treatment. 
The patient's social situation is taken into account, as our 
treatment also includes members of the victim's family to share 
in getting through the crisis safely without complications. 
Before the therapy starts, the patient is asked in for an 
interview during which a general evaluation of the case is made. 
We then acquaint him with the elements that will be included in 
his treatment. At the same time, together with proceeding with 
the evaluation, a three-part therapy program begins, comprised 
of psychological and physical treatment and social guidance. We 
have prepared a team of doctors to treat each of these phases. 
  "Meanwhile, the patient is treated with respect and caution. 
The therapist must remember patient reactions in certain cases. 
The therapist always obtains the complete background as to the 
types of torture that the patient has endured." 
  Is the al-Nadim Torture Victim Rehabilitation Center under 
any governmental agency or organization? 
  Susan Fiyad says: "The center cannot be subordinate to any 
governmental or other agency, or its purpose would be lost. The 
center was established on the basis of being a private, 
civilian, nonprofit company. It was registered on this basis on 
28 August 1993, under No. 2668/1993. The project comes within 
the scope of welfare services, and a part of the project's 
funding comes from Denmark through the Center for Research and 
Rehabilitation of Torture Victims (RCT) in Copenhagen. This is a 
center that was opened for the same purpose in 1982. 
  "The al-Nadim Center in Cairo is the first center of its 
kind 
in the Arab and African region. Therefore, we accept torture 
victims through organizations concerned with this matter, either 
from inside Egypt or elsewhere, in order to offer these unique 
and modern services. We also exchange data through 60 similar 
centers around the world that surpass us in experience." 
  Are there set fees for patient treatment? 
  "No material compensation is required for services offered, 
testing, and rehabilitative therapy. The only stipulation is 
having the total agreement of the victim of violence. The center 
is obligated to maintain complete secrecy and total respect for 
the patient's privacy. 
  "Moreover, the patient may also be referred to other 
specialists if required, for examination and action as 
determined for any accompanying physical disorder. This can be 
arranged in accordance with the initial visit with the patient. 
Accordingly, tests required to begin therapy and rehabilitation 
are determined. 
  "The center also accepts those who come on their own accord 
or who are sent by their family or friends, or by various 
organizations and agencies that deal with violence victims. The 
center also assists and supports tactical and practical efforts 
expended by local and international organizations with the aim 
of stopping violent practices and torture. The center offers 
short- and long-term psychological rehabilitative therapy to 
those who have been subjected to any form of physical or mental 
violence. 
  "Through the therapy of those who were tortured, we are told 
the facts of torture, beginning with the oppression of police 
stations to the torture in Sudan and detention in Israel. Let us 
begin with a case from the center and reports of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office." 

  -  Mirfat 'Abd-al-Hamid, airline stewardess. She was tortured 
in the Nasr City precinct by the chief of secret police and two 
of his aides in order to force her to confess to theft, despite 
the fact that the Public Prosecutor's Office acquitted her. This 
led to her attempting suicide by jumping out of the window of 
the secret police's room, especially after being threatened with 
being stripped of her clothes. She suffered a concussion, and 
broken teeth and collarbone. 
  -  Zakariyya al-Shami, professor in the Suez Canal University. 
He 
was punched and beaten in the face. He was transported in the 
trunk of a police car to the Ismailia second precinct, where he 
received additional abuse. The reason for this was that he 
scraped a police officer's car. 
  -  Salim Ibrahim Salim, an accountant in a well-known bank. He 
says: "I was subjected to savage torture by secret policemen, 
though I had committed no offense. They only wanted to do a 
favor for a friend of theirs who works for the same bank where I 
work. They lured me to the Cairo security directorate on the 
pretext of ending the dispute between me and their friend. From 
there they took me to the Nasr City precinct and severely 
tortured me. They hung me by my arms until they nearly snapped. 
Their hands also touched sensitive places of my body. There are 
medical reports regarding my case in the International Peace 
Hospital. Their torture resulted in my permanent disability. The 
Public Prosecutor's Office investigated but did not get 
anywhere. The dossier is now in the prosecutor general's office." 
  -  We shall leave these files and move on to Palestine. One 
Palestinian in the treatment center relates his story: "During 
12 full years of detention, I was in most Zionist prisons and 
detention camps. Naturally, I witnessed all shades of torture, 
to such an extent that over the last five years I have had no 
awareness of torture both physical and psychological, as if I 
were a dead being or a living dead man. I am receiving treatment 
from a team of doctors, including specialists in endemic 
diseases, surgery, and physical therapy, in view of the fact 
that 90 percent of my limbs are affected by fibrillation in the 
joints and rheumatism, in addition to psychological treatment." 
  -  As soon as Mrs. Jamilah, one of the victims of torture in the 
occupied Arab territories, was released and allowed to leave, 
she was sent to one of the Cairo hospitals to obtain intensive 
physical and psychological treatment, in view of her ill health. 
She continued under medical supervision for more than a year 
until her situation improved. However, what does she say about 
her personal experiences in Zionist prison camps? 

  Jamilah says: "My detention was terrible and frightening. 
How 
could I forget or explain it? There are no words for what 
did--and still does--go on in those slaughterhouses that they 
call the abominable Zionist prison camps. Everything in them is 
barbarous, brutal, and indescribable. The torturers are inhuman, 
as if they have no religion or faith. I could describe them as 
legions of bloodsuckers, killers, rapists, sadists, and deviates 
who came from the Dark Ages. It began when I was arrested by an 
official of the Civil Administration in Gaza. I was held in a 
tent on the beach, Shaykh 'Ajlan Street, in the army camp, for 
three hours. They tied my hands, feet, and head, and I received 
more than 300 blows and kicks from their hands and feet on every 
part of my body, thereby heedlessly violating my dignity and 
honor. Later, I was taken to 'Asqalan Prison. 
  "In the cell with me were two criminal prisoners. They 
crushed seeds and inhaled them up their nose. I was shocked that 
they asked me for sex; they were dressed only in their 
underwear. They were Jewesses of various nationality, who work 
as prostitutes. They were in prison because of criminal cases. 
The authorities put us with them to humiliate and debase us. 
  "I resisted and hit one of them in her face several times. I 
was hit on the head from behind. Because of this, I became 
unconscious. When I came to, I found that they had completely 
stripped me of my clothes. 
  "I was unable to tell how long I had been in this condition. 
My body was broken. After four months of brutalization and 
torture of various kinds in the prison camp, violating my honor 
in barbaric ways, I was left broken and in pain. I was in 
agonizing pain, because of a lack of calcium, nutrition, and 
sustenance. My sound teeth were extracted without drugs. I was 
restrained in shackles. Three teeth fell out without anyone's 
assistance. I felt extreme pain in my right foot and hand, and 
pain in my head that is indescribable. I also suffer from lack 
of control in the joints of my foot. I suffered a psychological 
crisis and a nervous breakdown. As soon as I was released, after 
a year, they allowed me to leave, and I came to Cairo for 
physical and mental treatment." 
  It is difficult for one Sudanese journalist to remember 
escaping from the grasp of the Islamic Front. She was subjected 
to several medical examinations as a result of her enuresis, 
bowel problems, and nightmares that haunt her as long as her 
eyes are closed. "After two years in Sudanese prison camps that 
we called ghost houses, I was able to flee and come to Cairo. 
  "For four months my eyes were bandaged, and I was stripped 
of 
my underclothes. My skin was .......... They dropped me down 
into a deep well, filled with foul odors, almost like corpses, 
either animals or human. They were not content with just 
torturing me physically, but rather they made me watch others 
being tortured to death. 
  "They sowed seeds of fear, terror, and anxiety in my soul. I 
had not imagined such barbaric, merciless torture. I had never 
imagined watching the torture of others, even more painful than 
what I was subjected to. I wanted to die. They were intent on 
stopping me from fainting so that the torture could continue. 
  "I asked myself: What did I do? What are the real reasons 
for 
this torture. Why didn't they kill me at once? I asked myself 
that, until the day came when I was able to escape by a miracle. 
  "I responded to the treatment after more than five months in 
Cairo."

<F P=106> [Article by Moulay Abderrahmane: "Terrorist Groups Fighting </F>
Among Themselves: A New War Among Leaders"--first paragraph is 
EL WATAN introduction] 
  [Text] The answer of the AIS (Islamic Salvation Army) was 
not long coming; they inveighed against the GIA's [Armed Islamic 
Group] latest initiative: taking over the FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] and placing the political leadership directly under the 
control of the national emir, Abou Abdallah Ahmed (Mohamed 
Gousmi in civilian life). Twenty members of the GIA will be 
executed in retaliation by the AIS, Baa Azzedine's communique 
announced. You cannot touch the "chouyoukh" and get away with 
it. Meanwhile, Benhadj is said to continue his letter-writing 
activity with a letter to Zeroual. 
  The communique signed by Gousmi for the GIA, Redjam for the 
FIS provisional executive committee, and Said Makhloufi for the 
HDI [Haraket addawla al Islamiya] and the MIA [Armed Islamic 
Movement] (on behalf of Abdelkader Chebouti who would have 
achieved the feat of being there while being elsewhere) suffers 
from authentication problems at a time that is propitious to all 
manipulations. 
  However, there are some indications that this attempt to 
unify armed groups (the pious hope of Hocine Abderrahmine, 
instigator of the attack at the Houari Boumediene airport) and 
the subsequent communique may be genuine. 
  First, the tone. It confirms, on the one hand, the approach 
of the three terrorist groups, namely the rejection of any 
notion of a dialogue with the government, and on the other hand 
the campaign launched in mosques to clear Makhloufi of the 
suspicion of being an informer, under which he had been since 
the death of Djaafar el Afghani. 
  This almost unnatural rapprochement of Old Makhloufi and 
Iranian Gousmi must have been the result of a deal. 
  The former pledged allegiance to the latter who, in turn, 
rehabilitated the author of the "Civil Disobedience Manual" who 
had been suspected of belonging to the security services. The 
second indication that makes it all credible is the reference 
(the first one) to suicide terrorist attacks. 
  Those who have an idea of Gousmi's initiatory path will see 
it as a legible signature. Gousmi never concealed his Shiite 
preferences, and while others were trained in Peshawar he chose 
Qom for his Pasdarans and the training personnel of the Lebanese 
Hezbollah, the promoter of suicide attacks. Counterterrorism 
specialists established already long ago that armed group 
members avoid direct confrontation with the enemy. They fire at 
unarmed people, in the back, or when they are superior in 
numbers, but they never face death. 
  In other words, this rules out suicide attacks. 
  That people talk about it may mean that a new strategy is 
being introduced, a sort of Iranization of terrorist activities, 
but it bears the mark of the former coordinator of the FIS 
community office in Birkhadem. 
  Baa Azzedine, also known as Mustapha Abou Mohamed, probably 
considered that Gousmi was blinded by his ambition. The 
communique he signed shows that he had read the one issued by 
Redjam, Makhloufi, and Gousmi. 
  How can this small community executive expect to command all 
these "leaders with a prestigious past"? 
  Controversial as he may be, Makhloufi is still a great 
figure 
of Islamism. Rabah Guettaf, mentioned in the airport case, is 
still a former comrade of Bouyali. Abassi and Benhadj rank 
practically as prophets. Chebouti remains the only known and 
recognized Islamist general. And now the Shiite from Birkhadem 
claims that all these men pledged allegiance to him. 
  Baa Azzedine's violent speech denotes the determination of 
the FIS (the FIS from before the Batna congress, that is) to 
distance itself from the GIA, its mistakes and its dirty hands, 
on which is wiped today the blood of all the victims, especially 
the foreigners whose dead bodies keep weighing more and more in 
European or American parliamentary debates. By announcing openly 
that 20 GIA members were to be executed, the AIS, of which 
Katibet Ennasr, its "victory squad" wrote the text and decided 
on the sentence, Chebouti's eternal assistant just declared a 
war that carries all the germs of barbarity. [sentence as 
published] 
  The mention of the names of the banned-FIS chairman and 
vice-chairman in this case of allegiance to the GIA not only 
aroused the anger of the "victory squad" leader, but it also 
poses a credibility problem. No armed faction, no matter how 
bloody its record, may get the honors of the jihad unless it 
clearly publishes the fact that it acts with the blessing of the 
imprisoned leaders. How does one extract this blessing, and in 
what form? No one knows. 
  We know that the first letter that Benhadj wrote from his 
cell to Chebouti caused the penitentiary administration to react 
and change the conditions under which the FIS leaders were 
detained. Now we are told that Benhadj did it again, since he is 
said to have written to the head of State. The contents, it 
would seem, are far from friendly.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Over 700 Said To Have Been Killed </F>
Since Mid-March"] 
  [Text] After a few weeks of relative calm, attacks by 
Islamist armed groups resumed, killing at least 15 members of 
the security forces during the last 10 days. Most of these 
attacks were reported in the local press but not confirmed 
officially. This new outbreak of terrorism follows intensified 
repression operations in all of Algeria since mid-March. 
  According to a nonofficial estimate made by the AFP, over 
600 
alleged Islamists, some 30 members of the security forces and 
over 100 civilians (including six foreigners: four Frenchmen, 
one Russian, and one Vietnamese) were killed during that period. 
That is a total of over 700 dead. The offensive of the security 
forces is said to account for the lack of progress of the 
"dialogue" with imprisoned leaders of the banned Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] initiated late last year by the government. 
  Although many believe that these contacts continue, the 
government does not seem in a hurry to meet the demands of the 
Islamist movement. The latter demands, among other things, that 
its leaders be released or put on probation, and it asks for a 
speedy return to the electoral process. A few days from the Aid 
El Adha (Feast of the Sacrifice), which will be celebrated next 
Saturday, the recurring rumor of a possible release of 
banned-FIS leaders, including Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, is 
circulating again. So far, however, there is no indication that 
the government is planning any gesture of clemency. 
  Simultaneously with intensified military repression, special 
courts have pronounced several tens of new death sentences since 
the beginning of May. Last Sunday, the Algiers and Oran special 
courts alone sentenced 34 individuals to capital punishment. 
These verdicts bring to 489 the number of death sentences 
pronounced since special courts took office on 22 February 1993. 
So far, 26 of these sentences have been carried out. 
  The development of the Algerian crisis was debated at length 
last Monday in Brussels by the European Union (EU) foreign 
affairs ministers. To try and prevent an "Islamic swing over" 
that would have "incalculable consequences," "the only card we 
can play is the economic card," the French foreign affairs 
minister, Alain Juppe, stated. As a result, on Monday 16 May, 
the foreign affairs ministers agreed to immediately grant 
Algeria a loan of 150 million ECUs [European currency units] 
(990 million French francs), representing the second installment 
of a balance-of-payment support loan promised in 1991. The 
Twelve also agreed to consider a new loan of 200 million ECUs 
(also in the form of a balance-of-payment support loan) by the 
end of the year, subject to a favorable decision by the IMF and 
the Paris Club.

<F P=106> [Article by Yacine Lahcene: "Teachers in the Service of </F>
Terrorism"; first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction] 
  [Text] Once again, a terrorist association headed by 
teachers has been rendered harmless by the security 
services. 
  Thirty-one individuals: that is how many members there were 
in the terrorist support network recently dismantled by the 
security services. One of their "leaders" is none other than a 
middle school teacher employed at the Ben Amlar CEM [College of 
Intermediate Studies] in Mila. Five other teachers and a school 
inspector were also active in the group. 
  Apart from its size--especially important to the security 
services, since they were able to make a big haul--this case 
provides additional proof of the link between Algerian schools 
and terrorism. It is also proof that some teachers, who are 
members or supporters of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation 
Front] and therefore completely behind fundamentalist and 
obscurantist ideology, have not confined themselves solely to 
joining armed groups but have also taken command of those who 
kill, burn, and destroy. 
  Is it necessary to point out that at least 315 teachers have 
been discovered in terrorist groups? That of the 7,000 
individuals interned in the centers in the south in 1992, there 
were 1,224 teachers, professors, and educators? That nine 
teachers with weapons in their hands have been killed by the 
police? Those figures, alarming to say the least, show in their 
own way how widespread is the disease that is eating away at 
Algerian schools and will eventually destroy them if we keep on 
pretending not to see anything. 
  It must not be forgotten that those who have sullied the 
teaching profession began by instilling radicalism and 
fundamentalism in our children--the future pillars of the 
nation. They took advantage of the fact that the schools were 
already in a noticeably shaky state to infiltrate them and 
propagate their doctrine. 
  What were school officials doing while that was happening? 
Nothing. They had their eyes closed because they were much more 
concerned with their own status. Today the school system, the 
source of learning, is a disaster area. And we are only too 
aware of the results of that policy: children placed in the 
hands of the "teachers of terrorism." But it is also true that 
other teachers who oppose the plan have long been sounding the 
alarm.

<F P=106> [Article: "Tamanrasset: Dismantling of Passport, Visa </F>
Trafficking Ring"] 
  [Text] (APS)--Acting on a tip, members of the National 
Gendarmerie in Tamanrasset recently arrested a gang of nine 
foreign nationals (three Liberians, one Beninese, and five 
Nigerians) who were engaged in manufacturing false passports and 
visas in exchange for large amounts of foreign exchange, it has 
been announced by the Gendarmerie. 
  A search of the home of one member of the gang in the 
Tahaggart district of the city of Tamanrasset resulted in the 
discovery of a batch of seven counterfeit official seals from 
various government departments, notably the round seal of the 
Algerian Republic, an entry visa seal from Ain Guezzam (the 
southern border post in Tamanrasset), an entry visa seal from 
Assamaka, Niger, and date stamps, as well as a large number of 
unspecified seals and accessories used in the falsification 
process. The members of the Gendarmerie also discovered a large 
batch of passports of various nations (Ghana, Mali, Benin, 
Liberia, and Nigeria), consular cards from Ghana, identification 
papers, and falsified international passes. The gang of 
traffickers was brought before the public prosecutor in 
Tamanrasset on charges of counterfeiting seals, falsifying 
documents and using falsified documents, and illegal entry into 
and residence in Algeria. The defendants were placed under a 
committal order. 
  In a different case in the same neighborhood, the 
Gendarmerie 
recently arrested an individual of Algerian nationality who was 
transporting 2 kg of hashish-type drugs for sale in Tamanrasset. 
The drug trafficker was brought before the public prosecutor in 
Tamanrasset and jailed for possession of drugs.

<F P=106> [Article: "`Coupon Book' for Bread"] </F>
  [Text] Bread is in short supply in Bordj Bou Arreridj. The 
governorate's 135 bakeries, which are literally besieged by the 
citizens every day beginning at 0400, are no longer able to 
satisfy demand. In the 35 communes, the same scenes of genuine 
"stampedes" to buy bread are being observed. Some bakers have 
already chosen the "coupon book" system giving their loyal 
customers priority. 
  The phenomenon is explained by the shortage of semolina, 
which has restricted breadmaking at home, and by the layout of 
the governorate, whose largest towns are located on RN [National 
Highway] 5, a major traffic artery generating an irregular and 
unquantifiable demand that statistics are unable to predict with 
any certainty. 
  The sales management of Eriad [five food industry 
enterprises] reports, however, that it has increased its 
deliveries of flour, which now border on 1,600 quintals per day. 
The obvious inability to keep up with demand is being reflected 
in the price of a baguette of French bread, which now sells for 
5 dinars [DA]. Because of the complicity of a number of bakers 
who prefer to sell their production "at wholesale," bread is 
being found--at prohibitive prices and in dangerous hygienic 
conditions--in grocers' stalls and for sale by street vendors. 
  Despite its efforts, Eriad says that for the present it is 
unable to overcome the crisis, which cannot be eliminated except 
by the arrival in the near future of large quantities of 
semolina, deliveries of which will enable families to resume 
their usual food habits. 
  The Bordj Bou Arreridj Governorate will be able to relieve 
the small local bread "factories" when the industrial bakery now 
nearing completion goes into operation. It will supply school 
cafeterias and local communities. It will produce 35,000 loaves 
per day. 
  The phenomenon is also explained by changes in the rural 
population's food habits due to the gap between the cost price 
of bread and of pastry/crepes. [sentence as published] The 
peasants in the region have given up the practice of growing for 
their own consumption because of the clearly superior advantage 
they gain by selling their quintal of wheat for close to 
DA1,400. There is a definite advantage in selling their entire 
harvest with the added bonus of "lower domestic household 
expenses."

<F P=106> [Article by N.E.B.: "Dark Days for Black Marketeers"; first </F>
paragraph is LE SOIR D'ALGERIE introduction] 
  [Text] Black marketeers active on the country's 
eastern and western borders are beginning to experience hard 
times now that measures have been implemented to combat the 
smuggling scourge. 
  In the eastern part of the country, following the steps 
taken 
to combat illegal exports of goods primarily to Tunisia, 
Algeria's borders are becoming less and less permissive. That 
fact is having a favorable impact on the local market in the 
governorates of Tarf, Souk-Ahras, and Tebessa. Those border 
areas are beginning to find a greater availability of consumer 
goods thanks to regular supplies. The steps in question have 
been all the more effective in that the price deregulation 
affecting those goods, which have long been subsidized by the 
state, has discouraged supporters of the black market. 
  The most spectacular result is the pronounced drop in the 
price of red meat, which now ranges from 160 to 200 dinars [DA]. 
Fraudulent exports of domestic livestock have been markedly 
curbed, and stockraisers are being forced to send their 
livestock to the market in their own governorate. To get back to 
the subject of food products, implementation of the new price 
policy has discouraged black marketeers in that even the market 
stalls in the border villages are beginning to show signs of 
health, the exceptions being certain localities in the Tebessa 
Governorate where prices have been holding firm in the case of 
salad oil, Lahda powdered milk, and coffee. The reason, 
according to the authorities concerned, is the inadequate supply. 
  As part of the same struggle, the Tarf Governorate, which 
has 
set up its own ad hoc committee, is continuing to update its 
commercial registry thanks to the combined efforts of the 
governorate's commercial departments and the Customs Service. 
  It has also been decided to introduce permits for merchants 
who buy consumer goods, the purpose being to achieve better 
control over food products intended for sale exclusively in that 
governorate. Early results show that those measures are 
effective. 
  The fight against the black market is also beginning to 
produce a few favorable results in the western part of the 
country. The most recent measure, which consists of prohibiting 
taxi drivers, for instance, from transporting passengers across 
the border, is already enabling customs officers to keep better 
control over individuals and has "facilitated their task when it 
comes to searching baggage," according to one customs inspector, 
who adds that "the systematic recording by the customs offices 
of all outgoing receipts makes the inspection of passengers more 
effective and gives us more control." On 11 May alone, the 
number of passengers totaled 1,312, and receipts totaling 
DA393,600 in taxes were recorded. On that same day, a large 
quantity of products was seized, including white meat, eggs, 
rice, black pepper, salad oil, insecticide, and so on. 
  For the moment, aware of the difficulty of covering the 
entire Algerian-Moroccan border, the trade departments backed by 
the Customs Service are thinking of starting a major cleanup 
operation involving in particular an updating of the commercial 
registries. 
  They will also have the task of finding a way to put an end 
to the trafficking in fuel, which is carried in vehicles 
equipped with large fuel tanks and then unloaded somewhere along 
the road on the other side of the border. According to experts, 
that activity results in substantial profits. As is true on the 
country's eastern border, food products are again appearing in 
the market stalls, meaning that there has been a positive effect 
since the beefing up of border surveillance. 
  Tea, flour, sugar, and semolina are readily available in 
localities in the Tlemcen Governorate. Even the price of lamb 
has dropped to DA260, compared to DA300 a few days ago. In 
Maghria, however, the price of red meat has not dropped, the 
reason being the regulations governing the trade in livestock.

  The new retail prices took effect on 17 April. 
  The price of granulated sugar in bulk went up from 17.35 to 
26.85 dinars [DA] per kilogram, while that of packaged 
granulated sugar rose from DA20.10 to DA29.25 per kilogram. 
  The average price of coffee rose from DA135 to DA200 per 
kilogram. Prices vary depending on the quantity in the package. 
  Ground coffee in 250-gram packages will now be sold for 
DA210.60 per kilogram (about DA53 per package) and for slightly 
less (DA208.25 per kilogram) in the case of the 500-gram package. 
  The price of coffee beans is now DA198.25 per kilogram (a 
little under DA50 for a 250-gram package), while unroasted 
coffee will be sold to roasters for DA131.10 per kilogram, all 
taxes included. 
  No new price increase is scheduled before December 1994, 
according to Enapal's management, which says it has sufficiently 
"reassuring" inventories to stick to that schedule. 
  The profit margins have been increased from DA0.50 (35 
centimes for Enapal and 15 centimes for wholesalers) to DA1.50 
(DA1 for Enapal and DA0.50 for wholesalers). 
  Enapal based the new prices on the latest devaluation of the 
dinar (40 percent), the increase in profit margins for producers 
and marketers, and the new VAT [value-added tax] rates, which 
fell from 21 to 7 percent in the case of sugar but remained 
unchanged in the case of coffee (21 percent). 
<H5>  New Prices </H5>
  The public is informed that effective 17 April 1994, the new 
prices charged by Enapal for sugar and coffee imported, 
processed, and distributed by its units are as follows (in 
dinars per kilogram):

<F P=106> [Article by Nadira Foudad: "Neighborhoods Take Charge of </F>
Themselves"; first paragraph is L'OPINION introduction] 
  [Text] Citizen participation in the management of 
public affairs through the association movement is a a new 
feature in our country. 
  The citizens have long been accustomed to putting up with 
the 
rules and practices of the single-party system when it comes to 
managing and taking responsibility for social concerns. Under 
that system, any initiative outside the official institutions of 
the state was not permitted, and the citizens found themselves 
subject to all kinds of favorable or unfavorable measures 
adopted by the government on the strength of its social 
prerogatives. The continuation of that code of management in our 
country for more than a quarter of a century is at the origin of 
the citizen's lack of concern over any public action not 
affecting him directly. Despite that attitude, which has become 
an undeniable social reality, the process of setting up 
neighborhood committees and rural centers, which was begun 
precisely for the purpose of involving the citizens in the 
management of public affairs, has had a more or less favorable 
impact on the population. 
  The legislative elections in December 1991 enabled the 
members of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] to control 
most of the APC's [People's Communal Assemblies] across the 
country. As a result of the weakness and deterioration of the 
services they were providing, the Ministry of Interior and Local 
Communities decided to establish 10,000 neighborhood committees 
and rural centers as part of its operation for "citizen 
participation in the management of local affairs." That 
operation was launched in the form of directives and 
instructions issued to local authorities. The purpose is to 
involve the citizen in his problems of an administrative or 
social nature, examples being sewage, drinking water, repairs to 
streets and sidewalks, trash collection, street lighting, the 
opening of trails, and the construction of youth centers, as 
well as contributions to the embellishment of his neighborhood. 
As of now, 2,000 projects and miniprojects are already under way. 
<H5>  How To Set Up a Committee </H5>
  To set up a committee, residents of the same neighborhood 
hold a general meeting and elect 15 people, all of whom are from 
that same neighborhood. Those 15 elected individuals then 
constitute the neighborhood committee. As elected 
representatives, they draw up the minutes of the meeting and 
submit them to the DEC [local executive office] for approval and 
also so that premises in the neighborhood can be assigned to 
them. The committee will manage the neighborhood both 
administratively and socially. It will be regarded as the 
spokesman for the citizens and as the safeguard for protecting 
the property of the citizens and the state. 
  According to a summary of the statistics submitted by the 
various governorates and communes, 3,667 neighborhood committees 
and rural centers are planned. The budget made available for 
that purpose in 1994 by the Common Fund for Local Communities 
(FCCL) totals 500 million dinars [DA]. 
  According to the same summary, the number of communal 
coordinating boards totals 630, with 203,986 members. They 
represent an estimated population of 3,847,042. 
  In that regard, 1,500 agreements totaling DA176,367,819 have 
been signed nationwide, and 2,023 additional agreements are 
under study. 
  According to a report evaluating the projects submitted by 
the departments concerned, it should be noted that in the Alger 
Governorate, the operation for "citizen participation in the 
management of local affairs" is proceeding satisfactorily. 
  In that governorate, 17 projects have been targeted. They 
are 
concerned with the repair and embellishment of green spaces and 
playgrounds. The total subsidy granted is on the order of 
DA47,888,730 and covers seven agreements signed with 
neighborhood committees.

  The number of committees and rural centers in the Alger 
Governorate totals 396, including 155 that have been approved.

for a number of other governorates: 
  Bejaia: 126 neighborhood committees approved 
  Jijel: 170 rural committees approved 
  Blida: 65 neighborhood centers approved

  Chlef: 127 rural centers approved 
  Tlemcen: 339 rural committees approved 
  Constantine: 222 neighborhood committees approved 
  Medea: 480 neighborhood committees approved 
  The reluctance and distrust being displayed here and there 
by 
certain fringes of the population in response to this operation 
are due to a misunderstanding of the nature of the operation's 
objectives. In addition, there is reason to point out that in 
certain conservative regions--especially in the rural 
areas--disinformation is being spread with such intensity that 
the operation is perceived as being a new form of social 
organization dictated by the government to replace existing 
customs and traditions. That interpretation has caused 
considerable reluctance among many citizens in those regions. 
  Apart from the security aspect and the constraints of a 
methodological or bureaucratic nature, the impact of the 
operation remains considerable. An explanatory guide will be 
issued in the near future as appropriate. Later, the 
neighborhood committees will be converted into local advisory 
councils.

<F P=106> [Article by Suzy al-Jundi: "President to Worker in 6 October </F>
Town: Put Your Hand in Mine"] 
  [Excerpts] During a five-hour tour of the cities of 6 
October and al-Shaykh Zayid yesterday, President Husni Mubarak 
inspected a number of modern industrial installations. The 
president was accompanied on this tour by the ministers of 
transport and communication, of new urban communities, of 
economy, and of local administration, and the governor of 
al-Jiza. 
  President Mubarak's visit to the cities of 6 October and 
al-Shaykh Zayid has come within the context of his ceaseless 
interest in the issues of investment, housing, enhanced 
production, progress, and the creation of new work opportunities 
in order to elevate the citizens' standard of living. 
  At the outset of the tour, Engineer Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim 
Sulayman, the minister of state for new urban communities, 
pointed out the progress made by the city of 6 October, noting 
that there is a plan to build in the city a number of medical 
towns specialized in various branches of medicine so they will 
act as an attraction element. He also pointed out that the area 
of the town is 70 square km, of which the tourist areas cover 24 
percent, the residential areas 29 percent, and the industrial 
areas and green parks 18 percent. The city has 316 producing 
plants, 245 plants under construction, and 333 plants for which 
allocations have been made, thus bringing the total to 934 
plants that will employ 134,528 workers with total wages of 371 
million pounds [annually]. The investments will amount to 8.797 
billion pounds and the annual production from these plants will 
amount to 981 million pounds. The plants include 35 plants for 
food products, 14 for wood products and metal furniture, 10 for 
plastics, 11 for paper products, 27 for yarn and textiles, 33 
for electrical and engineering products, 22 for metal and 
mechanical products, 48 for construction materials, 39 for 
petrochemicals and medical drugs, and 67 for varied products, 
thus bringing the total to 316 plants. 
  The minister of state for urban communities added that the 
city will have a total of 70,310 housing units of various 
levels; that 30,805 units have already been constructed; and 
that work is underway to build 37,505 more units. 
  Dr. Sulayman pointed out that total investment in the 
infrastructure and in subsidiary structures has amounted to 
317,247 pounds and in housing to 298,884 pounds. [figures as 
published] The minister of state for new urban communities also 
explained to President Mubarak that the wholesale market 
buildings include buildings for the sale of vegetables, fruits, 
fish, poultry, and other goods. 
  President Mubarak then visited Dawud Electrical and 
Mechanical Products Company where Muhammad Ahmad Dawud, the 
company chairman, explained the plant's production of electrical 
motors. This is the first private sector plant to produce three 
and one-phase motors that are used in the production of washing 
machines, lathes, planing machines, agricultural machines, water 
pumps, and all kinds of industrial breakers. 
  This company's capital amounts to 23 million pounds and its 
production capacity amounts to 30,000 three-phase motors and 
240,000 one-phase motors. The plant has begun to export to Saudi 
Arabia. [passage omitted] 
  The president then visited al-Misri Company for Electronic 
Products, JVC [Victor Co. of Japan], which produces televisions. 
Engineer 'Abdallah al-Shahir, the plant manager, explained to 
the president, using machinery for illustration, the plant 
production volume. The plant was opened a year ago and produces 
21-inch screen television sets. At present, it produces 9,000 
television sets [annually] and employs 100 workers. It took six 
months to build the plant under Japanese supervision. The 
percentage of locally produced TV components is expected to 
reach 50 percent in two years. At present, it is 36 percent. The 
plant capital is 10 million pounds, and it is completely 
Egyptian. [passage omitted] 
  Finally, the president visited and toured the city of 
al-Shaykh Zayid and then returned to Cairo. 
  The president was told by Engineer Muhammad 'Abd-al-'Azim 
'Awadallah, chairman of al-Shaykh Zayid Development Agency, that 
the city is located 15 km from the Pyramids area and 2.5 km from 
the Cairo-Alexandria Desert Highway, and 12 km before the 6 
October City. 'Awadallah noted that the city includes two 
housing complexes consisting of 105,000 houses. They are capable 
of accommodating 440,000 people and they extend over an area of 
3,200 feddans. 
  'Awadallah added that the city is a residential-tourist 
complex that encompasses luxury, mid-level, and low-cost 
residential quarters. Some adjacent areas have been set aside to 
implement tourist projects. 
  He further added that work is currently underway to build 
21,000 low-cost housing units and that the value of investment 
in the projects under implementation is 150 million pounds in 
the first phase. It is expected that a large number of units 
will be built within six months. 
  'Awadallah also noted that the investments needed to 
complete 
the city amount to 105 million pounds.

<F P=106> [Article by 'Ala' al-Din Mustafa: "Investment Funds As A </F>
Vehicle to Attract Small Savings"] 
  [Text] Investment [mutual] funds, which will play an 
important and effective role in the Egyptian economy in the near 
future, are currently the subject of wide-scale debate. 
  One of the many advantages offered by the funds is that they 
channel their money into portfolios of securities such as 
treasury notes, bonds, bank certificates, and stocks in order to 
spread risk and guarantee suitable returns for investment fund 
stockholders. The success of the funds depends primarily on 
being managed efficiently and on the soundness of the economic 
climate as well as on the availability of the "goods" in which 
these funds trade--i.e., stocks, bonds, treasury notes, etc. 
They are limited by the availability of securities in the 
market. In other words, the supply of these "goods" should be 
increased in order to help mobilize savings and channel them 
into this new vehicle, just introduced to the Egyptian market, 
in a manner consistent with Egyptian economic conditions at this 
stage of economic liberalization. 
<H5>  An Effective Tool of Prosperity and Affluence </H5>
  Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, president of the Federation of 
Egyptian 
Banks and chairman of the National Bank, sees investment funds 
as new mobilization vehicles that address small investors who 
lack experience or who are averse to risk and who are unable to 
keep track of the capital market. Furthermore, such funds are 
suitable for our conditions in Egypt because they allow their 
investors to liquidate them when they wish. Investors are able 
in the early stages to redeem their investment certificates at 
their true value. 
  The funds are managed by experts who are fully knowledgeable 
of market conditions. A fund, in return for investor money, 
would issue financial papers in the form of investment 
certificates of equal par value which may range from 10 to 1,000 
pounds. 
  The banks, by creating such funds, play an important role in 
attracting small savers to a new type of investment and in 
preparing them to tolerate risk and invest in the capital market. 
  Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz believes that the funds would be able 
to 
increase the supply of goods in the market by purchasing the 
stock of companies being privatized by the government, and 
thereby broaden the trading base and help expedite the drive 
towards privatization. 
  At this point in time, investment funds could effectively 
help create a state of boom and prosperity by mobilizing small 
savings and channeling them into the purchase of diversified 
portfolios of stocks, bonds, and treasury notes, etc. That would 
create a state of affluence within the framework of an 
integrated banking strategy to invigorate the capital market. 
  The banks, in turn, would guarantee the securities, 
publicize 
companies wishing to issue financial papers, and assure the 
liquidity of those papers to the extent of 80 percent of their 
value. That would create conditions of prosperity and would make 
direct investment attractive to small savers, thereby boosting 
the capital market which is an important bulwark of any economic 
liberalization policy. 
<H5>  Investing With Calculated Risk </H5>
  Dr. Hamid al-Sayih, former economic minister and chairman of 
Egyptian-British Bank, said: 
  "The essence of investment funds is that they invest in a 
variety of financial papers. Let us consider the capital market 
in Egypt. Despite vigorous attempts at stimulation, it remains 
practically barren of an adequate mix of financial papers such 
as stocks, bonds, etc. 
  "That is caused by several factors such as compounded 
factors 
of the past, closed-door policies, and forbidding stock 
companies to issue financial papers. Furthermore, the capital 
market was closed for a long time before it re-opened. The end 
result was not simply the loss of the capital, or investment, 
market. We also lost the expertise needed to operate such a 
market. 
  "But the open-door policy was officially inaugurated 20 
years 
ago with the promulgation of Law No. 43 of 1943 and it follows 
that the capital market should have grown and prospered over 
those 20 years, resulting in an expanding supply of financial 
papers and other instruments. The capital market is concerned 
not only with securities but also with numerous other 
activities, such as financial leasing that could provide an 
appropriate capital market for Egyptian securities. 
  "The concept of investment funds...funds are created because 
a large segment of investors lacks the expertise to trade on the 
exchange and to evaluate financial papers. A fund therefore 
issues a single certificate that represents a portfolio of 
financial papers that investors can then acquire. 
  "To do so, a fund must have access to large quantities of 
various financial papers in order to allow it to spread its risk. 
  "Funds may deal in foreign financial papers but this calls 
for a great deal of expertise and requires domestic licensing, 
monitoring, and oversight. That is why the Capital Market Law 
has closely regulated the funds wherever they may be created." 
<H5>  Providing an Appropriate Investment Climate </H5>
  Dr. Hamid al-Sayih added: 
  "The question now is whether the time has come to create 
effectual investment funds. We must realize that few 
corporations offer securities in the capital market and that 
most stock companies are closed. This problem may ease in the 
future as the propensity to invest picks up momentum. 
  "Secondly, the government should issue bonds rather than 
treasury notes. Interest on the bonds could be either fixed or 
variable. The bonds could be of medium term (three to five 
years) or long-term of up to 10 years. The supply of goods on 
the capital market would therefore increase whenever the 
government acts but the options would still be limited, making 
it difficult for the funds to find an appropriate mix of 
financial papers in which to invest." 
  Dr. al-Sayih explained that the issue at hand is to create a 
suitable investment climate, especially since the advanced 
nations are competing for investments and since the countries of 
Eastern Europe are considered advanced because of their ample 
supplies of scientific and technical labor. The developing 
countries and those of the Third World therefore face intense 
competition in their efforts to attract foreign investments. 
<H5>  Funds Offer Several Benefits </H5>
  Misr Bank chairman 'Isam al-Ahmadi said: 
  "Many benefits and objectives may be realized through the 
creation of investment funds. These benefits extend to the 
sponsoring bank as well as to investors, to the capital market, 
and to the national economy as a whole. The experiences of the 
Americans, the British, and the French have proved the efficacy 
of those instruments in helping create strong and vigorous 
capital markets as well as in boosting individual wealth and 
quality of life. 
  "But such funds can exist only in an appropriate investment 
climate and that requires legislative and taxation groundwork as 
well as capital market regulations. Steps in that direction have 
already been taken and we are hopeful for even more 
streamlining. This also requires public awareness and confidence 
in the banking system and in the instruments it creates. 
  "Numerous benefits will accrue to those in dealings with 
investment funds. We, on our part, will launch educational 
campaigns to explain the relationship between fund and client; 
how to purchase fund shares and how to sell them and redeem 
them; how the return on investment will be computed; and the 
manner in which the value of the financial paper is to be 
calculated. This would help us attract clients to this new 
investment vehicle by building their confidence in its quality." 
  'Isam al-Ahmadi added: "We would like to note that 
investment certificates primarily target small savers since the 
certificates are issued in increments of 1,000 pounds, allowing 
any small saver or small investor to tap them rather than turn 
to savings accounts, bank certificates, and other instruments of 
bank deposits. Savers whose only choice has heretofore been bank 
deposits would have available several investment options. 
<H5>  Expanding the Trading Base </H5>
  "A most important advantage of mutual funds is that they 
make 
it possible for small savers to enter the capital market which 
has so far been a monopoly of large investors and the wealthy. 
Investment certificates would reduce and spread investment risk 
through diversification and through timing by investors. 
Investor desires will determine which financial papers are to be 
held by the fund. The higher the return investors seek the more 
risk they would be willing to assume. Risk may be minimized to 
the extent of diversification among corporate stocks, treasury 
bonds and notes, and bank certificates. Investment in stock 
usually involves higher risk. 
  "Investment funds provide other benefits and help achieve 
other objectives, such as helping the Egyptian economy achieve 
the important goal of privatization. By expanding and 
invigorating the capital market and increasing its efficacy, it 
would be possible to expand the ownership base for companies 
whose shares are offered through investment funds. Companies 
targeted for privatization will therefore find strong demand for 
the shares they offer as well as a real market that would absorb 
those shares at fair prices. 
  "As to the capital market--and this is another benefit of 
mutual funds--invigorating the securities market is both an 
objective in itself as well as a means. A strong capital market 
would make it possible for the economic reform program to 
achieve its objectives, particularly in the areas of 
privatization, expanding the ownership base, and getting the 
citizenry involved in the economic activities of the state. 
  "With that in mind, Misr Bank has created a mutual fund 
capitalized at 25 million pounds and whose investments amount to 
500 million pounds. Its investment certificates will be offered 
to the public over time and it will maintain enough cash on hand 
to cover redemption demands. As stipulated by law, the fund will 
not put more than 10 percent of its investments in any one 
company nor will it acquire more than 15 percent of any one 
company's shares outstanding." 
<H5>  Creating New Instruments </H5>
  Dr. Midhat Hasanayn, professor of Economics and Banking at 
American University in Cairo, opined that "mutual funds are 
nothing new but go back at least 15 years. They are a 
risk-reducing instrument. While more risky than bank 
certificates of deposit, they offer the least risk of investment 
instruments because they guarantee a return in addition to the 
original capital. 
  "Mutual funds were conceived as a middle ground between bank 
deposits and investments in equity and debt securities. Ranked 
by degree of risk, bank deposits provide the least risk, 
followed by treasury notes that guarantee investors a return in 
addition to the principal but are illiquid and must be held to 
maturity. In that sense, bank deposits are less risky. 
  "The third investment rank is stock company bonds that pay 
fixed or variable interest but one must wait for that interest a 
quarter to a year. Bonds attain liquidity through the stock 
exchange. 
  "The fourth investment instrument, which entails the highest 
risk, is company stock. 
  "Mutual funds were therefore conceived as a middle ground 
between bank deposits and stock exchange securities. The 
clientele of mutual funds are primarily small savers who may 
lack expertise. Funds collect investor savings and thereby 
accumulate the cash they need to assemble a diversified 
portfolio of stocks, bonds, treasury notes, and bank deposits. 
Funds provide their shareholders with liquidity but at net asset 
value at time of redemption." 
<H5>  Restructuring the Capital Market </H5>
  Economist Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari said that "mutual funds are 
one of the main tools of creating new securities in an operation 
called "papering." This takes the form of bonds underlying 
various types of revenue-producing assets whose returns 
accumulate automatically or are paid out in fixed or variable 
sums depending on the fund manager's orientation. 
  "Funds are attempts by financial systems to create 
comprehensive and integrated service portfolios. Their returns 
are higher than those offered by banks, but they are associated 
with a degree of calculated risk managed with instruments and 
techniques that are well-known to fund managers. Funds have 
therefore been created to meet the needs of risk-taking 
individuals who seek high returns and who are willing to accept 
risks in the process." 
  Dr. Muhsin al-Khudari points out certain caveats that must 
be 
kept in mind when selecting fund managers. Above all else, they 
should possess a high degree of skill and expertise, even 
preceded by loyalty and esprit de corps. This would presuppose 
scrutiny by various law and order apparats since these fund 
managers will have access to great amounts of cash with which 
they can manipulate the markets or do harm to them. This may be 
averted by not allowing any individual to have single control of 
a fund but to vest such control in operating teams with highly 
developed patriotism, sincerity, and technical expertise." 
<H5>  Diversified Portfolios </H5>
  Banking expert Nazir Yusif said: "Investment funds are a 
financial amalgam whose investors are issued shares or 
certificates, as defined by law, that are valued at no more than 
1,000 pounds each. There is no limit to the number of 
certificates that may be acquired. 
  "A fund's management may invest its cash in a portfolio 
composed of the stocks of existing companies or of those that 
are being privatized. It may also buy bonds or treasury notes to 
diversity the portfolio and therefore spread the risk since 
stocks that appreciate will cushion the price declines of others 
in the portfolio. 
  "Funds also maintain enough cash on hand in order to meet 
redemption requests for the certificates they issue in case 
investors want their money back. This is called open-investment 
funds. 
  "Shares in other types of funds, the closed-end kind, are 
traded on the stock exchange. This is the main difference 
between the two. 
  "Funds were born in the Gulf countries despite their small 
market size and their countries' lack of regulatory controls 
such as those promulgated by the Capital Markets Law No.95 of 
1992. However, there are attempts to regulate the Saudi market 
against broker speculation and manipulation. It is imperative, 
therefore, to begin monitoring the market and not to hesitate to 
introduce adjustments or additional regulations in order to 
control the capital market in Egypt and help it grow. 
<H5>  Guarantees to Safeguard Fund Monies </H5>
  Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki, former economic minister and chairman 
of International Arab Banking Corporation, said that "investment 
funds are a new activity in Egyptian markets and play a tangible 
role in energizing financial paper transactions and in 
attracting small investors to participate in financial activity 
by subscribing to the certificates issued by the funds. The 
funds relieve small investors of effort and worry resulting from 
the lack of know-how or financial expertise to invest their 
savings in financial markets. Fund managements will assume, on 
behalf of their shareholders, the tasks of purchasing, 
diversifying, and maintaining their portfolios as well as 
distributing the quarterly or annual dividend, as the case may 
be, in accordance with their holdings in their fund. 
  "Numerous controls have been promulgated by Capital Markets 
Law No. 95 of 1992 in order to safeguard depositor monies. For 
example, the Mutual Fund Creation Law stipulates that 
establishers of a fund are prohibited from managing that fund. 
The law also stipulates that the investment company investors 
are the ones to create the fund. Certificate holders are the 
ones to finance the fund. A fund owner, while buying securities 
for other certificate holders, would probably buy certain 
securities for himself. Therefore, the end-result would favor 
the interest of fund owners. 
  "The law has devised a solution to this so-called conflict 
of 
interest between fund investors and fund depositors or 
certificate holders. That solution is to prohibit investment 
funds from managing the portfolios of fund subscribers. That is 
the purpose of the law that regulates fund management companies. 
  "Banks that created investment funds have simultaneously 
created companies to manage those funds. A company that manages 
a fund is totally separate from it. An investment fund owns but 
does not manage, whereas a management company only manages and 
does not own." 
<H5>  Creating New Financial Papers </H5>
  Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki added: "Furthermore, investment funds, 
by their nature, have the advantage of dealing in large 
assortments of financial papers in order to spread risk. They 
buy financial papers in various sectors such as agriculture, 
industry, tourism, shipping, and other activities. 
  "In addition, the Egyptian capital market still enjoys an 
advantage, in that it is, by its composition, free of 
speculation in the sense that the so-called buy-and-sell 
capability neither rests on the investor nor is a function of 
future markets. That is an on-going external operation. The 
reasons for security market collapses on international 
exchanges, such as Black Monday and subsequent events, is 
attributed to this type of trading activity. It is preferable 
not to introduce this type of trading into the Egyptian market 
in the future. I am constantly warning against copycatting 
others in violation of our own nature, customs, and traditions. 
This is the way to avoid creating elements that could cause 
market turbulence or collapse. 
  "Several factors can shield the market against such risks 
and 
they constitute safeguards to protect the fortunes of those who 
trade in the market." 
  Dr. Hasan 'Abbas Zaki moved on to another point dealing with 
the natural structure of the market. He said that the Egyptian 
market is still limited in the quantity of papers in circulation 
and that, of course, is a burden on the banks. By contrast, 
bonds constitute a major segment of international markets. In 
the United States, for instance, we find bonds of various types 
and maturities ranging from six months to 30 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali] </F>
  [Text] An economic report Prepared by the Information 
Center of the Cabinet points to: a continuation of the gradual 
drop of average interest rates for treasury notes and of the 
average discount rate, stable interest rates for deposits and 
loans in U.S. dollars over the past several months, a relative 
rise in the exchange rates for all of the main foreign 
currencies, a drop in Suez Canal revenue indicators during 
January and February 1994 compared to the same period in 1993, 
and a drop in sales of reinforcement bars during the same 
period, in which electricity, oil, and gas production rose, and 
inflation continued to decline gradually. 
  Monetary indicators in the report by the Information 
Center--which is overseen by Dr. Hisham al-Sharif, an advisor to 
the administrative development minister--point to a stable 
average interest rate for deposits in Egyptian pounds since last 
July. That rate remains at 12.5 percent. However, in actuality, 
public-sector banks with accumulated liquidity are paying 11 
percent to 11.5 percent for three-month deposits; the longer the 
deposit term is, the lower these rates are. Small banks are 
paying the lowest rates, due to their more difficult 
circumstances and relatively high risks. 
  Between April 1993 and April 1994, the interest rate for 
short-term U.S. dollar deposits remained stable at around 3.04 
percent. 
  The average interest rate for treasury notes has continued 
to 
drop gradually, reaching 13.4 percent during the first week of 
April 1994, compared to 14 percent at the start of 1994. Experts 
believe that the drop is a sign of the market's health, because 
the notes are devoid of risks, and it is senseless for their 
interest rates to be higher than bank deposit rates. Also, the 
continued drop in the treasury note rate will compel some who 
save in treasury notes to go to the capital market in search of 
higher returns. 
<H5>  Special Rates Given by Large Banks </H5>
  The average discount rate, which is the rate the central 
bank 
charges for loans to banks, continued to drop, reaching 16.06 
percent in March 1994 and 16 percent in the first week of April 
1994. However, in practice, the banks are lending to enterprises 
at an interest rate 2.5 percent higher than the discount rate. 
Thus, loans for some industrial activities have rates of 18 
percent, while loans for commerce have slightly lower rates. At 
the same time, some large banks are lending to some of their 
clients at 13 percent, because these banks need to invest their 
liquidity surpluses to offset the cost of deposits. On the other 
hand, the index number of the loan and discount balance at the 
end of 1993 is the same as that of March 1992, which is 
connected to the current slump. 
  The lending rate for U.S dollars was 5.04 percent during the 
first week of April 1994, which is the same rate as that of 
March 1993. 
  Exchange rates for the main foreign currencies rose in 
general during the first months of 1994. Between January and 
March, the U.S. dollar rose from 337.24 piasters to 337.94 
piasters; the European Currency Unit [ECU], from 367.68 piasters 
to 375.09 piasters; the pound sterling, from 493.99 piasters to 
494.85 piasters; the German mark, from 192.96 piasters to 197.6 
piasters; the French franc, from 56.78 piasters to 58.06 
piasters; and the Japanese yen, from 299.8 piasters to 328.07 
piasters per 100 yen. 
  During the first week of April 1994, the rates for the 
German 
mark, French franc, and ECU fell slightly, while those for the 
other currencies rose. 
<H5>  Explanation for Drop in Inflation </H5>
  The monthly inflation rate--i.e., the rate at which consumer 
prices increase--increased by 0.5 percent in January 1994 and by 
1.2 percent in February. Thus, the annual basis for inflation 
rates, which indicates the rate of change in a month relative to 
the same month of the previous year, reached 7.4 percent during 
January and 7.3 percent during February 1994. 
  The annual average inflation rate, which better reflects 
inflation, reached 11.8 percent during January and dropped to 
11.4 percent during February. We asked Dr. Mukhtar Khattab, the 
chief of the decisionmaking support section in the Information 
Center of the Cabinet, how inflation can drop while the prices 
of some commodities, including rice and sugar, have risen in 
previous months. He said that the consumer price index is one of 
the best practical methods for measuring inflation. However, it 
does have several shortcomings: It is based on a single consumer 
basket, whereas in reality different groups in society have 
different consumer baskets, depending on their social level. The 
Egyptian index prepared by the Statistics Agency contains 402 
goods and services. The annual base of inflation during February 
was 7.3 percent. But the rate of inflation for the prices of 
some goods and services included in the indicator was higher 
than 7.3 percent during that month: Fish prices rose by 14.7 
percent, housing and fuel prices rose by 10.4 percent, prices 
for pharmaceutical and medical instruments rose by 16.8 percent, 
meat and poultry prices rose by 10.3 percent, prices for cereals 
and starchy foodstuffs rose by 11 percent, ready-made clothing 
prices rose by 9.7 percent, and the price of sugar rose by 11 
percent. However, the indicator measures the average price of 
goods and services according to their relative weight in the 
consumer commodities basket. Thus, a 10-percent rise in fuel 
prices does not mean a 10-percent rise in inflation, because the 
weight of fuel in the consumer's budget may be 5 percent. Thus, 
the effect of such an increase on inflation in 1971, for 
example, was canceled out. 
  On the other hand, a drop in the prices of some commodities 
may cancel out increases in the prices of other commodities, so 
that the consumer price index drops. Last February, the 
indicator of dry legumes dropped by 0.5 percent, while prices 
for dairy products and cheese rose by only 0.4 percent, 
restaurant and hotel prices remained unchanged, beverage and 
cigarette prices remained unchanged, and prices for furniture, 
carpets, and household effects rose by 3.6 percent.

  [Text] Regrettably, some of our writers prefer the policy 
of straddling the fence to confront terrorism. This is why one 
finds them devising a strange terminology to water down the 
issue. If, for example, they are compelled to denounce radical 
groups, they rush to denounce what they allege to be government 
terrorism and police methods that create a climate of violence, 
as they say. 
  This card shuffling leads them to say strange things with 
the 
sole purpose of inciting the masses in the wrong direction. 
Instead of declaring their rejection of any acts that are 
capable of terrorizing citizens and awakening sedition, you find 
them twisting words in order to give people impressions that are 
in total contrast with the truth. 
  One of the strangest forms of criticism and opposition in 
Egyptian political life is the kind that criticizes the 
government and the security agencies for confronting terrorism. 
It is as if this kind of criticism and opposition wants the 
government to stand idle in the face of terrorists until the 
fire spreads to the straw and until they turn Egypt into another 
Iran. 
  Do the security agencies initiate violence and terrorism in 
the streets? Do they hit peaceful tourists and strike banks? Are 
these agencies expected to stand and watch criminals who pose a 
threat to public security and who spread fright among people? Do 
these critics consider the security agencies' confrontation of 
this evil tendency a form of repression and terrorism? 
  The terrorists have recently developed their strategy in 
Egypt and have moved to adopt the idea of destroying anything 
and everything indiscriminately. Their terrorism is blind and 
mindless. This is why all agencies concerned have had to 
confront this bloody terrorism firmly and with all means and 
methods and to uproot it in order to protect this country's 
security and safety. 
  It is normal to arrest the plannners and leaders of 
terrorist 
groups. Without these arrests, terrorist activities and 
incidents in Egypt would have multiplied and sedition would have 
spread everywhere. 
  Despite the delicate and sensitive situation, the decisive 
and effective confrontation that we witness today is conducted 
in accordance with the law which empowers the Ministry of 
Interior to detain suspects for a one-month period. After this 
period, the detainee is entitled to resort to the judiciary. If 
a court orders the detainee's release, the ministry is entitled 
to appeal the decision in two weeks. If the court orders his 
release again, then he is released immediately. But if the court 
orders continued detention because of the detainee's danger to 
society, then the detainee is entitled to appeal anew to the 
court once every month, as stipulated by the aforementioned law. 
  This means that arrests of the leaders of sedition are made 
under the judiciary's control for the sole purpose of ensuring 
society's security and safety. 
  If those who follow the misguided path had God's fear in 
their hearts for their country and kinsmen, they would have 
dropped the weapons with which they threaten the peaceable 
workers of this country, and they would have proceeded to 
express themselves peacefully through parties, newspapers, 
unions, and other channels of peaceful political action and 
opinion-expression podiums. They would not have subjected 
themselves to arrest, appeal, and other similar procedures, 
especially within the democratic system under which our country 
lives and that guarantees free political action and a free press. 
  In Egypt, there are 13 political parties and more than 100 
newspapers. Egypt also has trade unions and workers federations, 
and all of these are legitimate outlets for whoever wishes to 
participate in political action. As for those who intentionally 
and purposefully abandon and reject all this and take up the 
rifle to kill peaceable people, then they have only themselves 
to blame. The government's eyes are vigilant and the national 
security agencies are performing their role in the best manner, 
and may God protect Egypt from all harm.

  [Text] Opposition pens have been mobilized to criticize the 
new law concerning village mayors and chiefs and to try to 
depict this law to the public as backsliding from democracy, 
because it has decided to shift from the system of mayoral 
election to mayoral appointment. 
  These pens have expressed their apprehension that the new 
method will open the door to favoritism in selection and will 
lead to village isntability and that the appointed mayor will 
owe his loyalty to the government alone because the government 
is the party that appoints him. 
  These people who have become accustomed to shuffling the 
cards are really amazing. The village mayor and chief are two 
administrative officials serving security. Therefore, they have 
no parliamentary capacity. 
  Because democracy means government of the people by the 
people through their deputies and because the village mayor and 
the village chief are two public employees, exactly like a 
precinct commander or a police station chief, one is required to 
make a complete distinction between democracy and a civil 
service job whose main task is to preserve security and 
stability. 
  There is absolutely no connection between village mayors and 
chiefs (both of whom are civil servants) and democracy. If the 
method of election had been embraced in the past, then a mistake 
was made and this mistake must be corrected. 
  The village chief and mayor do not rule. The elected local 
council does. The chief and mayor are civil servants appointed 
by the Ministry of Interior to preserve public security. Is a 
civil servant chosen by election? 
  Moreover, the mayoral election process itself has not been 
taking place in a sound manner that reflects a village's wish. 
Rather, the process has been governed by clannishness and by 
strong influences, not to mention the rancors, disputes, and 
conflicts to which mayoral elections have led and which pose a 
threat to village security. Therefore, appointment will 
certainly lead to stability and security, and not vice versa. 
  Besides, how can one say that appointment will lead to 
favoritism and to the selection of favorites, and not the right 
people? There are specific controls and rules that require that 
those who seek the position of village mayor or village chief 
meet certain general prerequisites. Furthermore, special 
conditions are established to compare candidates and there are 
three committees that participate in the selection process to 
ensure that the best are selected. In addition, the opportunity 
to contest an appointment is available. 
  Is it mpt strange that the opposition would criticize a 
mayor's response to government demands and his cooperation with 
the various government agencies? Are the village mayor and 
village chief not public employees appointed by the government? 
Does the government work for anything other than the masses' 
interest? 
  The opposition seeks to depict the government as a party 
that 
always stands in the way of the people's wishes and interests. 
This is untrue and illogical and it reflects illwill. 
  Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi has underlined 
a noteworthy point in the new village mayors and chiefs law, 
namely that the mayoral election system does not guarantee the 
mayor's continued presence in his village in order to carry out 
his duties. Most mayors have lived in provincial capitals, 
contenting themselves with the honor of the position. Meanwhile, 
villagers had to go to the mayors wherever the latter happened 
to live. In addition, an elected mayor did not receive an 
adequate monetary recompense to help him devote his time to the 
duty of the mayoralty. This contrasts with the appointment 
system which establishes a monthly recompense of 150 pounds 
which, along with the minimum income he receives by law, will 
help the mayor devote his full time to the duties of the job.

<F P=106> [Article on the National Planning Institute's "Report on </F>
Human Development in Egypt," prepared in conjunction with the UN 
Development Program] 
  [Excerpt] The first "Report on Human Development in Egypt" 
was published Monday afternoon. The report, prepared by the 
National Planning Institute and the UN Development Program, 
ranks the governorate of Port Said first and the governorate of 
Sawhaj last regarding human development. It states that all 
Egyptian governorates suffer from a housing shortage, close to 
42 percent of Egypt's urban population lives in Cairo and 
Alexandria, and Cairo is the most densely populated governorate. 
  The ceremony [on the occasion of the publication of the 
report] was held under the auspices of Deputy Prime Minister and 
Planning Minister Kamal al-Janzuri. It was attended by the UN 
Development Program's resident representative, Kirstant Muwaziyu 
[name as transliterated], and by professors of the National 
Planning Institute, officials of the UN program in Egypt, 
economics professors, and groups of intellectuals and 
journalists. 
  Regarding per capita income, the report ranks the 
governorate 
of Port Said first, the governorates of Damietta and Cairo next, 
and the governorate of Sawhaj last. 
  The report states that, relative to international human 
development averages, human development in the governorates of 
Port Said, Cairo, Alexandria, Damietta, and Suez is average; it 
is lower than average in the governorates of Lower Egypt, except 
for Damietta and al-Buhayrah. The report states that the 
governorates of Upper Egypt, except for al-Jizah, suffer from an 
extremely low rate of human development. 
  The report indicates a large disparity between the 
governorates of Egypt regarding the individual's average share 
of income. It attributes the leading position of Port Said, 
Damietta, and Cairo to the capital turnover in those 
governorates. It also stresses that the paucity of the 
population in Port Said increases the individual's average 
annual share of income there. 
  The report adds that Asyut and al-Minya lag behind all of 
the 
governorates with respect to the individual's share of income. 
The report advocates restructuring the general state budget to 
favor human development. It emphasizes the general role played 
by internal and external security regarding stability, consumer 
pricing based on economic foundations and a carefully considered 
procedure, the adoption of measures to reduce the severity of 
poverty in the framework of production projects, and the 
harmonizing of businessmen's social responsibility with their 
profit-oriented goals. 
  The report warns of the effect of unemployment on the 
development plan. It calls for the selection of suitable 
production methods to cope with the problem, encouragement of 
private-sector projects to create new jobs, the provision of 
social and health services to workers, and the easing of tax 
burdens. The report also warns of the income distribution 
disparity. It cautions against redistributing factors of 
production in the manner of the agriculture reform in the 
fifties. The report calls for the attainment of a decentralized 
popular partnership and the development of capabilities and 
organizational cadres in the area of management. The report 
reviews Egypt's economic performance and the economic 
experiments tried in the country. It states that the growing 
population increase will swallow the majority of income. It 
warns that economic growth by itself will not help slow 
population growth. The report states that economic growth in 
Egypt has usually depended on, and been influenced by, external 
factors. It adds that economic growth is linked with economic 
imbalances, e.g., the balance of payments deficit and the budget 
deficit. 
  The report states that the unemployment problem has been 
exacerbated by the fact that economic growth, although it has 
been low, has not been based on a labor-intensive production 
model. The report calls for the creation of suitable jobs as 
part of the state's general employment policy. 
  At the same time, the report stresses the need to blend 
economic growth with the distribution of income to create a 
society based on fairness and equality. The report states in its 
general remarks that the population increase has become a burden 
on the educational system and state budget. It advocates 
lowering the birth rate to reduce this burden in the future. It 
calls for establishing an employment insurance fund to remedy 
problems stemming from the redistribution of the labor force 
among public, private, and trades projects. The report 
emphasizes the pervasiveness of education in Egypt; almost one 
out of four persons in Egypt is either a student or teacher, 
which is higher than the average ratio. The report commends 
Egypt's achievements regarding the education of girls, and it 
states that there is no shortage of teachers in Egypt's 
educational system. 
  The report also addresses the housing problem, pointing to 
the shortage of housing units that has accumulated over the past 
30 years, which has forced people to occupy dwellings that are 
in danger of collapsing. The report states that all Egyptian 
governorates suffer from a housing shortage. 
  Regarding the labor market, the report states that the 
policy 
of free education and the compulsory hiring of graduates has had 
extreme effects on the labor market. The report warns that the 
taxation burden in connection with the privatization of public 
enterprises will increase unemployment. It states that coping 
with this problem will be a challenge facing any future human 
development strategy for Egypt. However, the report emphasizes 
that the public-sector's control over investment has enabled the 
renewal and expansion of the infrastructure base. [passage

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dr. Bashir al-'Allaq] </F>
  [Text] Let us begin with a well-established, inescapable 
fact: Cooperation with the student and youth sector is no easy 
or routine task in a country thatpects its people, looks 
discerningly toward its people's future, glorifies its 
independence and sovereignty, and follows a policy of maximum 
self-reliance. Such cooperation--in order to be genuine, 
effective, and fruitful in building the nation's power 
base--requires a large measure of skills that are not developed 
within conventional contexts. The development and consolidation 
of this vital base requires aware leaders to possess not only 
concrete capabilities but also the humanitarian, spiritual, 
physical, and moral leadership qualities connoted by the word 
"leader." This base also requires innovative, enterprising 
leaders with firm resolve, i.e., who can make decisions at the 
appropriate time, not in isolation from society at large, but 
through interaction with it. In other words, a successful, 
effective, productive student and youth leadership is one that 
can directly and indirectly influence not only students and 
youths, but also the country or society at large, including all 
of its cultural institutions, subdivisions, and links. 
  It is extremely important to understand, absorb, and act 
according to this last point, because the young generation is 
society's foundation, the nation's springboard, and, by 
extension, the nation's "most" vital segment. Therefore, crises, 
muddled perception, or psychological shocks affecting the young 
generation endanger the entire nation and its future. Hence, the 
importance of the young generation being led by leaders of great 
substance, who can scout out, nurture, bring to fruition, and 
unleash the latent creative abilities of this "priceless 
resource." 
  The leaders whom we have in mind are not just 
"administrative 
leaders," although such leaders are important. The leaders whom 
we have in mind are "vital, combative, believing leaders with 
spirited approaches to life," who marry their consciousness to 
the struggle, the battle [jihad], and development, who can 
unleash the fresh, active, spiritual energies of the young. 
  Only with such leaders can we say--with the utmost optimism, 
confidence, and trust--that the young generation will proceed on 
the path to building the civilized, strong, fortified society 
for which we hope. 
  Based on the preceding, the election of comrade 'Udayy 
Saddam 
Husayn to be chairman of the Executive Office of the National 
Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of 
Youths of Iraq is a great gain for this vital sector. It marks 
the beginning of a new phase in which the marrying of 
consciousness to the struggle, battle, and development will be 
prominent, clear, and manifest as it rises up before all 
segments and components of our society at large. 
  Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not a traditional leader. He 
is not a youth or student whose ideas are framed academically or 
bound by his age. True, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn possesses 
all of the characteristics of youth in terms of the freshness of 
his spirit and his innovation, ingenuity, initiative, 
creativity, and vitality. However, comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn 
also possesses--and this is extremely important--the wellsprings 
of his father, the leader and symbol, Saddam Husayn, who is an 
inexhaustible well of combative action, brilliant combative 
conduct, maturity, superior ability to make decisive decisions, 
human touches, bravery, boldness, patience, and hearty 
identification with the nation's history, land, and combat 
mission. Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn is not only a graduate of 
the school of the great leader Saddam Husayn. He is also a 
primary link in the equation that links the past with the 
present and the future. This is the link that the enemies of 
Iraq and the nation [ummah] are attempting to break with their 
reprehensible conspiracies. These conspiracies aim to deprive 
young Arab generations of their role and cut them off from their 
spiritual and combative history and legacy, in addition to 
distorting their culture, motives, and standards, and destroying 
their personality. 
  We are thus facing a new period for students and youth that 
is based on the foundation built by the great leader Saddam 
Husayn, with his great, unlimited concern for students and 
youth. There are many justifications and reasons for this 
exceptional concern. Foremost among them is the leader's firm 
conviction that students in Iraq understand that educational, 
intellectual, and philosophical goals converge in their sector, 
making it a pivotal sector. Youths--of whom students comprise a 
large segment--are the nation's most vital segment, as stated 
above. Concern with youths is thus tantamount to concern with 
the nation's present and future. 
  It is certain that the new leadership of the National 
Federation of Students of Iraq and the General Federation of 
Youths of Iraq will shoulder many tasks that will guarantee the 
achievement of qualitative leaps in student and youth activity. 
We believe that this will happen. In order for student and youth 
activity to be successful, fruitful, and effective, all state 
institutions must cooperate with the programs and plans of these 
two federations. We should realize that the development of 
mature students and youths is society's collective 
responsibility to its young generation. By themselves, neither 
the two federations nor other organizations can cultivate mature 
young people. Vital slogans must be highlighted, and efforts 
must be made to translate them into reality. This requires 
collective efforts in which the two federations are 
participants, but not the sole participants. 
  The party for example, as the leader in society, can take 
action within social channels on two related tracks. First, it 
can protect students and youths from possible behavioral 
deviations. Second, it can solve, through education, problems 
that might obstruct the progress of students and youths. In this 
regard, the party must expand the two federations' cooperation 
and integration with pertinent official agencies, e.g., the 
Interior Ministry, the Labor and Social Affairs Ministry, the 
Health Ministry, the Education Ministry, and the Higher 
Education Ministry. The party must also emphasize basic, vital 
slogans, and it should do so in harmony with what is put forward 
by the two federations and other organizations involved in 
student and youth welfare. 
  Field studies on students, for example, show that most of 
the 
problems facing students lie outside of the educational 
framework (e.g., the college, university, etc.), and even 
outside of education itself. In other words, they are social, 
economic, and other problems. This means that the scope of 
national action with respect to youths will be very extensive 
when it is supported by the efforts of other organizations that 
bear responsibility for the welfare of students as human beings, 
members of this nation, and future leaders. 
  The election of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn as chairman of 
the Executive Office for Students and Youth will be a great help 
and a major, decisive factor in making all party and state 
organizations work like a beehive with the two federations to 
achieve the goals that have been set. The moral and practical 
value of comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's election by a consensus 
to the chairmanship of the student and youth sector is apparent 
in this regard. For comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn will solve the 
problems of students and youths based on a scientific, 
revolutionary, cultural, humanistic, completely integrated 
method. Our great leader Saddam Husayn will also solve the 
problems of Iraq and the nation. The results of this type of 
problem-solving will be great and brilliant. 
  Comrade 'Udayy Saddam Husayn's solutions to the problems of 
students and youths will certainly be suited to and commensurate 
with the major challenges facing Iraq and our nation. They will 
be formulated in the light of creative, theoretical thought and 
the Ba'thist action of the essential leader, Saddam Husayn. And 
they will be formulated within the framework and approach of the 
blessed July Revolution, which has supported students and youth 
unlike any other revolution, Arab country, or foreign country in 
our contemporary history. 
  We fully trust that the son of the great leader Saddam 
Husayn 
will play a role--the one for which our leader has raised 
him--in enriching the march of students and youths toward 
concrete action, and in enriching the major achievements that 
have been and will be accomplished for great Iraq. For Iraq has 
won its bet through the cooperation and solidarity of its 
resistant, patient people. It has won its civilizational bet. 
The glorious mother of battles has given us one proof after 
another that our future will be bright. The mother of battles 
multiplied our reserve of optimism, which is based on facts and 
givens. 
  We have great confidence in our students and youths, because 
this faithful, primary segment--which has been raised on true 
patriotic principles, on the principles and values of the 
nation, and on the directives of the nation's leader, and which 
has helped defend the nation at all costs--is no longer an 
experiment. It is a living accomplished fact, the crown and wall 
of this nation, and the symbol of its vigor. 
  The historical initiative will always remain in the hands of 
generations that maintain the vitality of their combative youth, 
the generations of the Ba'thist school, the school of the great 
leader Saddam Husayn, and the school of the glorious mother of 
battles.

<F P=106> [Article by Nuri Talabani, university law professor in Iraqi </F>
Kurdistan: "Persecution of the Kurds by Surrounding Them With a 
Suffocating Blockade"] 
  [Text] It is regrettable that the crimes of the Iraqi 
regime did not lead to punishment of the perpetrator or even to 
international condemnation until the regime invaded Kuwait and 
mounted another attack on Kurdistan, which resulted in about 2 
million Kurds heading toward the mountains and toward 
international borders compelling the UN Security Council to 
issue its Resolution 688 on 5 April 1991 concerning guaranteeing 
human rights in the Kurdish area in particular and in Iraq in 
general. But the Iraqi regime has continued its hostile policy 
in violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned UN 
resolution even after it was issued. We refer, in particular, to 
the regime's imposition of the economic blockade on the 
liberated area of Kurdistan, which currently includes the 
governorates of Irbil, Dahuk, al-Sulaymaniyah, as well as part 
of Kirkuk, and its continued implementation of the policy of 
forced relocation and Arabization [of Kurds] in the Kirkuk and 
Khanaqin areas and the Kurdish areas in al-Mawsil, which are 
presently under the control of the Baghdad government. The 
regime is also continuing to arrest Kurdish citizens in these 
areas and to execute many of them without trials. In addition to 
all this, the regime is continuing to follow a policy of 
genocide against the people of southern Iraq, is draining their 
marshes, and is mounting constant military campaigns against the 
inhabitants and using chemical weapons against them. 
  All of the UN Security Council resolutions dealing with 
Iraq, 
including Resolution 688, were issued because of the regime's 
aggressiveness and violation of the precepts of international 
law, as well as human rights in Iraq. There are lots of measures 
that the international community could take against the Iraqi 
regime in order to ensure compliance with the above-mentioned 
resolution, and they include the following: 
  1) Lifting the international economic blockade against Iraqi 
Kurdistan. 
  In order to justify keeping the international economic 
blockade against the liberated areas of Iraqi Kurdistan, some 
people quote the fact that these areas are part of Iraqi 
territory and that one should not lift the blockade against them 
as long as a blockade was imposed against Iraq in its entirety. 
This pretext is nothing more than a pure formality, resembling 
the pretext for non-intervention in the internal affairs of 
sovereign nations, even if human rights are violated. 
Fortunately for persecuted peoples, this pretext ended with the 
end of the Cold War and violations of human rights are now 
considered grounds that permit intervention under any 
circumstances and conditions. 
  The issuing of any law or piece of legislation, whether 
domestic or international, takes place because of particular 
reasons, which are usually called "compelling reasons for 
legislation." As we know, the compelling reasons for the 
Security Council's issuing its resolution dealing with the 
imposition of the economic blockade against Iraq were to punish 
the Iraqi regime and to force it to comply with other 
resolutions that the Security Council had issued. The inclusion 
of the liberated areas of Kurdistan in the resolution imposing 
the blockade against Iraq is a tremendous injustice against the 
Kurdish people. The reason for this is that the Kurdish people 
have never been part of this regime, but rather they have always 
been among their fundamental victims. 
  Even with regard to the second war in the Gulf, which 
brought 
on the imposition of the blockade against Iraq, it is a fact 
that the Kurdish people participated in it only incidentally. 
This is because most of the Kurdish soldiers gradually left the 
ranks of the Iraqi armed forces after Iraqi forces entered 
Kuwait. During the attack against the Iraqi forces on the night 
of 17 January 1991, most of the Kurdish soldiers had already 
left the ranks of the army. As we know, it is not right to 
punish a person or a party for a deed that that person or party 
has neither committed nor participated in committing, especially 
if the person or party is one of the foremost victims of the 
perpetrator--which, in this case, is the Iraqi regime. 
  The Iraqi regime that began its invasion of Kuwait at the 
beginning of August 1990 had already begun its aggression 
against the Kurdish people starting in the latter part of March 
1975 by destroying its cities and villages and waging genocide 
against them. The result of this policy by the regime was the 
destruction of more than 4,500 Kurdish villages and dozens of 
their principle towns, the killing of more than 100,000 Kurds in 
the notorious looting operations, chemical attacks on Kurdish 
cities and towns, and the forced relocation of tens of thousands 
of Kurdish families to southern Iraq where they were forced to 
live in compulsory "collectives." The imposition of the 
international economic blockade on Kurdistan has led to 
punishing the victim instead of the criminal who has gotten off 
scot-free, except from the blockade--the effects of which are 
being suffered only by the Iraqi people in general, and the 
Kurdish people in particular because they are not included in 
the scope of government supply operations. 
  One of the strange ironies is the fact that the Iraqi regime 
does not consider the liberated area of Kurdistan to be part of 
Iraq and treats it as if it were a hostile country. For this 
reason, the regime has proceeded to impose still another 
economic blockade on this area and is preventing food supplies, 
fuel, and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan. Recently it 
agreed to sell fuel and fuel supplies to the government of the 
territory of Kurdistan through the international aid 
organizations, which undertook to pay the Iraqi Government for 
these materials in U.S. dollars at official prices. The Iraqi 
Government took another despotic measure against the territory 
of Kurdistan when it made the decision to cancel the 25-dinar 
denomination of Iraqi currency in May of 1993 and then prevented 
people from Kurdistan from going to Baghdad to exchange the 
25-dinar bills that they had in their possession. This hurt 
people very badly and inflicted great damage on Kurdistan's 
economy--to the tune of hundreds of millions of Iraqi dinars. 
The Iraqi regime once again proved that it does not consider the 
people of Kurdistan to be Iraqi citizens, but rather as hostile 
foreigners. A Kurdish citizen feels this look of hostility when 
he is forced to cross the government "control points" where he 
is subjected to harsh treatment that is experienced only by 
foreigners who are from a hostile nation. There is absolutely no 
justification for the world community's insistence on 
maintaining the international economic blockade against 
Kurdistan on the pretext that it is part of Iraq. This is why we 
see numerous international circles and parliamentary figures and 
bodies in many countries demanding that the world community lift 
this blockade against Kurdistan, particularly since the creation 
of a safe zone in Kurdistan for the purpose of protecting it 
from the aggression of the Iraqi regime has given an 
international dimension to Resolution 688 in order to grant it 
international protection. 
  2) Compelling the Iraqi regime to lift the state of siege 
that it has imposed on Kurdistan. 
  The imposition of the economic blockade against Kurdistan by 
the Iraqi regime was a despotic decision that is in violation of 
Security Council Resolution 688 both in letter and in spirit. 
The regime's aim in imposing this blockade is to starve the 
people of Kurdistan and to drive them away from their homeland 
again. The [Security Council] resolution was supposed to prevent 
this. Ever since the Iraqi regime imposed the blockade against 
Kurdistan in early September of 1991, we were expecting the 
international organization to take the initiative to warn the 
Iraqi regime and tell it to lift the blockade, particularly 
since the leaders in Kurdistan demanded that this organization 
intervene with the Iraqi authorities in order to get the 
blockade lifted, especially with regard to fuel and fuel 
supplies. The Iraqi regime's decision to prevent fuel and fuel 
supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to skyrocketing prices 
for these materials. Before the blockade, gasoline used to cost 
200 Iraqi fils per gallon, but now, after the imposition of the 
blockade against Kurdistan, a gallon of gasoline costs 60 dinars 
and sometimes even more. The Iraqi regime's continual prevention 
of fuel and fuel supplies from reaching Kurdistan has led to the 
cutting down of trees in the forests in order that the wood be 
used as fuel during the long and very cold winters, and this has 
resulted in damage to the environment there. 
  Lifting the international and Iraqi blockades against 
Kurdistan would make it easier to rebuild the economic 
infrastructure that the regime previously destroyed, and would 
make it easier for people to go back to working in their fields, 
factories, and businesses and not be solely dependent on the 
humanitarian aid that international aid organizations are 
providing to them. 
  3) The return of the tens of thousands of Kurdish families, 
which were relocated by force, to their Kurdish areas which are 
under the control of the Iraqi regime. 
  The rebellion of 1991, which took place in all parts of 
Kurdistan, resulted in the liberation of all of Kurdistan, 
including the areas of Kirkuk, Khanaqin, and the Kurdish areas 
in al-Mawsil. Then the Iraqi regime mounted a counterattack in 
which it used all types of heavy weapons and combat helicopters, 
and this enabled them to recover and reoccupy some of the 
Kurdish areas, particularly Kirkuk, Khanaqin, Shaykhan, Sinjar, 
and other areas. Ever since the regime reoccupied these Kurdish 
areas, the Kurds there have been subjected to very bad 
treatment. There are mass arrests and kidnappings, they are 
killed and their bodies are not even handed over to their 
relatives, and whole residential areas are destroyed and their 
inhabitants are driven away. The security forces in these 
Kurdish areas are also expelling the Kurds and forcing them to 
head for the liberated areas of Kurdistan after all their 
possessions have been taken away from them. Then Arab bedouins 
are brought in to occupy their houses and businesses. 
Intervention by international bodies to protect the Kurds in 
these Kurdish areas would be considered legitimate intervention 
within the framework of the concept of Resolution 688. 
  The authorities have prevented these families, estimated to 
be in the tens of thousands, from returning to their homes in 
spite of the agreement that was signed by the Iraqi government 
and Kurdish leaders in May of 1991 and in which the regime 
committed itself to allowing all Kurds to return to their 
original places of residence. Among these Kurds, there are a lot 
of people who are afraid to return to their homes because they 
were soldiers who deserted or they took up arms against the 
regime during the March [1991] rebellion. All of these 
families--totalling more than three-quarters of a million Kurds 
who live in the liberated areas of Kurdistan--depend on the aid 
provided to them by the international aid organizations in order 
to survive. 
  One of the basic aims of Resolution 688 is the return of all 
of these Kurdish families to the city of Kirkuk and the other 
Kurdish areas that are under the control of the Iraqi regime. 
For this reason, action should be taken to implement this humane 
demand before these people start slowly dying off. We should 
bear in mind that thousands of them have already died as a 
result of the spread of diseases and malnutrition, especially 
children and older people. But, if they return, this should be 
done under the permanent protection of international observers. 
This is something that the Iraqi regime has rejected so far, 
even though this measure is included in the concept of 
Resolution 688. 
  4) The holding of general elections in Iraq under 
international supervision. 
  In practice, Resolution 688 dealing with guaranteeing human 
rights in Iraq can be carried out only by a government that 
represents all the people as a result of the holding of free 
elections in all parts of Iraq, but under international 
supervision. In this context, there should be a change in the 
current elections law, and the electoral districts in Iraq 
should be redistributed. The reason for this is that the current 
law was set up especially to have members of the ruling Ba'th 
Party become members of the National Council. For example, 
Paragraph 2 of Article 14 of Modified National Council Law No. 
55 of 1980 stipulates that a candidate for the above-mentioned 
council "have completed military service or have been exempted 
from it and not have committed the crime of desertion or failure 
to show up for military service during the time period of 
Saddam's al-Qadisiyah [Iraq's war with Iran]." According to 
Iraqi law, this is considered to be a major crime punishable by 
execution in accordance with Law 137, which was issued on 13 
December 1983. Paragraph 5 of the same article stipulates that a 
candidate must "not have been convicted of the crime of 
conspiracy against the revolution of 17-30 July 1968 or the 
ruling regime, or the crime of attempting to overthrow it, or 
the crime of being in contact with foreign groups." Paragraph 9 
of this article makes another stipulation, previously referred 
to, concerning the necessity that the candidate believe "in the 
aims and principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July." 
  These conditions naturally lead to keeping out all those who 
do not share the opinion of the ruling party concerning the war 
with Iran, "Saddam's al-Qadisiyah," and the second Gulf war with 
Kuwait. 
  Furthermore, the above-mentioned law stipulates the 
agreement 
of the "higher body that supervises elections" to applications 
for candidacy, and this higher body includes leading members of 
the ruling Ba'th Party and some ministers and national leaders. 
The above-mentioned body determines the names of the candidates 
and has the right to omit from the list of candidates any 
candidate who, in their view, "does not believe in the aims and 
principles of the glorious revolution of 17-30 July." Any person 
whose name is removed from the list of candidates has the right 
to protest this within three days before the Revolutionary 
Command Council, whose decision will then be final. 
  From all of the above, it appears that it is impossible for 
non-members of the ruling Ba'th Party and persons who do not 
support its policies to become candidates for membership in the 
current National Council. For this reason, National Council 
Elections Law No. 55 of 1980 should be completely changed. 
Furthermore, the electoral districts should be redistributed and 
there should be a return to the Chamber of Deputies elections 
law which was in effect before 1958, or else a new law should be 
legislated.

<F P=106> [Article by Yusuf al-Khu'i, prominent Iraqi Shiite at the </F>
Imam al-Khu'i Establishment in London: "The Persecution of the 
Shiites Amid an Outcry and Foreign Silence"] 
  [Text] There are some basic assumptions concerning the 
Shiites of Iraq which are wrong and are based on utterances and 
analyses made by politicians and scholars, and which should be 
corrected from the outset: 
  1) Shiites constitute the majority of the people of Iraq, 
but 
they are treated by the authorities as a deprived minority. 
  2) The Shiites of Iraq are Arabs, and Iraq is the historical 
homeland of the Shiite movement. There are also [non-Arab] 
Shiite minorities in Iraq such as the al-Kurd al-Filiyah [as 
published] and the Turkoman Shiites. 
  3) The persecution of the Shiites of Iraq is being carried 
out not be Sunnis, whether Arabs or Kurds, but rather by a small 
tribal minority that is exercising absolute control over the 
nation. 
  The reason for the organized persecution is to be found in 
some basic contradictions. We find the majority of the people 
totally excluded from participating in the formulation of the 
nation's policy and the major administration of this policy. The 
nation's authority is a sectarian, tribal authority, the 
identity of the ruling party is secular, the state religion is 
Islam, the Ministry of Awqaf and Religious Affairs is in the 
hands of those whose doctrine is Sunni Hanafi, and most of the 
country's people are Shiite Muslims. 
  The Shiite Muslims are being subjected to a process of 
impoverishment and exclusion from government institutions, and 
they are being subjected to campaigns that have the aim of 
tearing them apart as individuals, families, and as a community, 
whether they are in cities or in the marshes. This sectarian 
persecution is not limited to those who are religiously 
committed people or to religious establishments. It includes the 
Shiite masses of people in general, even those who have served 
in some of the government agencies, the army, the party, and the 
labor unions on the lower levels. 
  The Shiites have suffered more from the dictatorship, 
because 
their numbers are greater, and because the ruling regime has 
made persecution of the Shiites a daily and all-encompassing 
practice. Deprivation of the Shiites has become a reality on 
which the instruments of higher authority [of the state] are 
based. 
  It is difficult to bring up the topic of persecution of the 
Shiites in Iraq because of its extreme sensitivity and because 
of the hateful feuds of sectarianism that might be aroused. 
  The person who benefits the most from not having this topic 
brought up and discussed is the dictator himself, and the only 
ones adversely affected are the people who are persecuted. We 
feel that the first step toward dealing with a problem is to 
acknowledge its existence, then assign a name to the problem, 
then define it in order that ways of dealing with it can be 
determined, and then begin solving it. 
  Work should be done patiently and quietly with the parties 
concerned. The issue should be discussed and set forth in 
detail, and a dialogue should be opened in order to bring up the 
political, social, and religious problems that afflict the 
Shiites of Iraq. Then action should be taken to eliminate the 
historical and political injustice that has afflicted them. This 
action should be taken within the framework of a single nation 
and an advanced and civilized society which would permit freedom 
of expression and freedom of religion and guarantee civil and 
political rights to everyone. 
  Frank discussion about the crisis of the Shiites in Iraq and 
open admission of one's Shiite affiliation does not mean that 
the identity of others will be assaulted or that discord will be 
stirred up. Any individual has the right to define himself in 
terms of his national origin, tribe, religious beliefs, or 
homeland. This does not constitute an assault upon, or 
provocation aimed at, others. Bringing up the problem of the 
Shiite crisis, assigning it a name, and demanding that the 
people of the nation solve it, does not mean that dealing with 
the crisis involves the creation of another type of political 
sect. The solution is not to be found in mounting a 
counterattack, nor do we call for a sectarian constitution. What 
we are calling for is to safeguard the freedom of individuals 
and the institutions of society within the framework of a single 
nation and to safeguard the civil, political, and religious 
rights of all sects. 
  We feel called upon to do justice to the truth, because we 
know that the Shiites are not a group of people with a new and 
heretical doctrine that has just come upon the scene. Their 
doctrine is one of the oldest in Islam and one of the most 
all-embracing schools of thought in terms of clarification of 
the faith, and they constitute the great majority of the people 
of Iraq. 
  In public life, they have been like other people in that 
some 
of them are open-minded and others are fanatical, some of them 
are guilty of excesses whereas others believe in brotherhood 
[with others], and some of them are tolerant whereas others are 
zealots. But, in general, Shiites act as people who are 
oppressed and ruled, and thus they are inclined to call for the 
holding of a dialogue, casting fanaticism aside, and submitting 
to the logic of reason, equality, justice, love, and peace. 
  In spite of the fact that the Shiites constitute a very old 
and authentic sect in Arab and Islamic history, they have 
remained far from the limelight of the world throughout this 
century. Also, there has been [in terms of information] a 
blackout against them in the countries where they live and among 
their compatriots, such that people have only very limited and 
faulty knowledge about them. 
  During the last few years, the word "Shiite" in most 
countries has become synonymous with extremism, violence, 
terrorism, etc. Furthermore, another view, which is mistaken and 
which is no less important than the one mentioned above, has 
become predominant, and it is a view from which the Shiites 
still suffer. It is the fact that Shiites' patriotism is 
questioned and they are accused of being loyal to Iran, and the 
Shiite masses are looked upon as extremists and terroristic 
minorities who threaten the security and stability of the Middle 
East. 
  It is for this reason that Saddam Husayn has utilized these 
mistaken views and unfounded fears concerning the Shiites to his 
own benefit, he has acted with great skill to feed these views 
and to attempt to prove that they are true, and he has committed 
crimes against humanity and accused the Shiites of having 
committed these crimes. 
  The result of all of this has been that a thick curtain has 
obscured the importance of the Shiites' positive presence, 
unjustified questions have been raised, and sanction has been 
given to attempts to create a distorted image of the people who 
belong to this branch of Islam. At the very least, they are 
approached with wariness and caution, and at the worst they are 
treated very negatively and are the victims of suppression and 
torture. The most prominent example of this extreme negative 
approach was the crushing of the rebellion of the people of Iraq 
in February of 1991. For them this was a human and historic 
catastrophe in which the religious centers, mosques, Shiite 
gathering places, holy shrines, institutions of learning, 
clergymen, and the Shiite masses were subjected to destruction 
and genocide and their vital centers were crushed, and the world 
has hardly seen anything like it during modern history. The 
world looked on with silence while this great tragedy was 
happening to our Shiite Muslim Arab brethren on all levels. 
Anyone who reads the history of modern Iraq will find that the 
Shiites of Iraq and their clergymen played a major role in the 
struggle against foreign occupation and imperialism and 
participated in the liberation of Iraq. And the fatwas 
[religious orders] issued by Shiite clergymen dealing with the 
holy war against foreign occupation in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, 
Libya, and Arab North Africa greatly influenced the feelings of 
the Shiite people. Historically it is a fact that the Shiite 
clergymen played a pioneering role in the process of human and 
cultural development in the Arab world. Anyone can attest to the 
fact that the Shiite clergymen and imams wrote all sorts of 
works in the fields of science and literature and works in the 
field of religion that dealt with Islamic jurisprudence, 
principles of the faith, interpretation of the Koran, and 
[Islamic] philosophy. 
  And now we are bidding farwell to the 20th century in which 
we saw the occurrence of the world revolution in communications 
between nations that has led to constant human activity and 
caused the nations of the world to become opened up to each 
other. We also saw the establishment of the UN, which brought up 
the issue of human rights and freedoms, and dozens of public 
organizations and bodies were established to defend the rights 
of the oppressed. Also, public conferences and councils have 
been held in order to help curtail the injustice that has been 
the lot of those who generally have been people who have been 
deprived, by virtue of their tragic situation, of even the most 
basic opportunities--available in some nations--to have their 
complaints and cries against injustice be heard. 
  In spite of all this, the Shiites of Iraq still are 
suffering 
the greatest hardships, in addition to what they used to suffer 
because of the gulf between them and the ruling regimes. It is 
very unfortunate that this feeling has not been restricted to 
political establishments and governments. It has also been found 
in many civil and religious circles and even in some 
establishments that are characterized by open-mindedness such as 
universities and other organizations that usually sympathize 
with oppressed peoples. There is no doubt that the atmosphere 
that accompanied the birth of the Islamic Republic in Iran 
played a major role in causing these negative and tense 
attitudes to become worse than they were previously. With no 
justification at all, the Shiites of Iraq have had to bear the 
brunt of this. They have even been hit with the accusation, in 
general and in particular, that they constitute a danger, that 
they are terrorists, and the like. The oppressed [Shiite] nation 
has paid, and still pays, the price of this. 
  The Shiites of Iraq today are being subjected to 
persecution, 
expulsion, suffering, slow death, mass killings, and deprivation 
of the most elementary human rights and the right of citizenship 
because the world still is indifferent to their suffering, due 
to sectarian, political, and geographical considerations. 
  In spite of informational blackout attempts, the world has 
clearly witnessed the use of incendiary bombs and lethal weapons 
by the Iraqi regime [against the Shiites]. They have been used 
to commit genocide against peaceful communities of inhabitants 
of a particular ethnic or religious origin, and human 
communities have been destroyed by artillery shelling and 
draining the waters of the marshes in southern Iraq. The world 
has also seen tanks crush and destroy academic and cultural 
establishments and public libraries, it has seen holy shrines, 
places of worship, cemeteries, and Shiite gathering places 
desecrated, and it has seen the killing and arrest of clergymen, 
tribal chieftains, and ordinary people in vicious and 
all-encompassing attacks against the Shiites and the cultural 
heritage and legacy of the members of the Shiite community. In 
addition to all these crimes, there has been followed, on the 
pretext of the economic boycott, a policy of plunging most of 
the Shiites into a condition of starvation because of the sect 
to which they belong, while a very small minority of them live 
in comfort, oppressing the others. Iraq's prisons are still full 
of thousands of innocent people, including more than 100 Shiite 
clergymen from the Imam al-Khu'i School in al- Najaf, which is 
one of the most venerable of Islamic schools in terms of its 
heritage and contributions to civilization, and is on a par with 
the university of al-Azhar. Saddam Husayn's regime proceeded to 
destroy this thousand-year-old school, burn its public 
libraries, and imprison those from the institution. 
  It is clear that what is happening to the Shiites of Iraq 
today constitutes a clear violation of the paragraphs of the 
International Declaration on Human Rights and the rights of 
minorities that appear in the documents of the UN. We hope that 
this exceptional situation will be studied and dealt with, and 
that the necessary proposals will be put forth in order to 
prevent the repetition and continuation of this tragic situation 
in Iraq and other countries.

<F P=106> [Article by Ury Nir: "The Reminder of Normandy"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- A wave of heroic nostalgia is sweeping 
America these days on the eve of the celebrations of the 
anniversary of the landing of the Allied forces at Normandy. 
Memorial ceremonies and lectures in the schools, films about 
World War II on television stations, and special supplements in 
the daily and weekly press. But these celebrations, especially 
the share of the administering of them, are full of irony. For 
if the invasion of Normandy, the beginning of the end of World 
War II, symbolized the beginning of 50 years of active American 
intervention overseas, the Clinton administration constitutes 
the end of that era, and the allies of the United States again 
yearn for determined American leadership. 
  In recent weeks, the Clinton administration has lost yet 
another large measure of prestige and strength overseas. From 
Korea to Haiti, from China to Bosnia, the foes of the U.S.A. are 
learning that it is possible, and sometimes even worthwhile, to 
oppose it. Its friends are learning that it is difficult to rely 
on it. As the days of the Clinton administration go by, it 
becomes clearer that what appeared to his predecessor, George 
Bush, as a mission, appears to Clinton as a nuisance. 
  On his way to the White House, Clinton thought, justifiably, 
that the American public held the strength of the president in 
the internal sphere to be more important than his power 
overseas. Now it is becoming clear to him that the slogan "It's 
the economy, stupid" was a good election slogan that blew the 
right wind in the sails of his campaign, but in the White House 
it is turning into a squall that is liable even to throw its 
passengers overboard. The public opinion polls prove that 
Clinton's weakness in the foreign sphere is not overlooked by 
the public and impairs his popularity. 
  The American people are indeed more interested in internal 
matters than foreign affairs, but it wants to see a strong, 
determined, and proud president. Clinton's weak hesitation in 
the sphere of foreign relations, therefore, harms not only the 
image of the U.S.A. in the world, but also his own image. 
  When the subject is humanitarian failures of the 
administration, which was supposed to stress this aspect in its 
foreign policy, so be it. President Clinton did not make even 
one harsh denunciation of the insane genocide raging in Rwanda. 
As far as intervention, it is understood that there is nothing 
to talk about. 
  When the President disavows his promises to exert heavy 
pressure on China in the area of human rights, so be it. When 
the military junta in Haiti mocks loudly the promises of the 
American President to return Jean Bertrand Aristide to the 
presidency, so be it. Clinton's image can be forgiven. To a 
certain extent, America's image, as well. But when things get to 
the point of a threat to world peace, the negligence of the 
world's only superpower is criminal negligence. 
  The reference is to the North Korean crisis--the events 
around the efforts for nuclear armament of Pyongyang have become 
complicated, and the dynamic of the events is too complicated 
for the American press to give them proper coverage. It may be 
assumed that the majority of the American public is not 
completely aware that an isolated state, with an unstable 
regime, about developments in which there is scanty intelligence 
information, is developing nuclear weapons under the nose of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and is threatening 
explicitly to use them against one of the main allies of 
America, South Korea. 
  The present crisis is going on in a region of the highest 
strategic importance to the United States. Again and again, the 
North Koreans are going against the U.S.A. and the entire world, 
either by selling ballistic missiles to countries like Iran and 
Syria, or by their nuclear tricks. 
  Washington's policy of appeasement has failed. "For every 
step that we take in order to slow (the North Koreans' nuclear 
race) they take two steps in order to speed the process," said 
the American expert on nuclear affairs Leonard Spector, in an 
interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES. Even after the 
director-general of the IAEA, Hans Blix, announced last Friday 
that its inspection delegation cannot carry out its mission 
properly because the North Koreans are deliberately speeding up 
the pace of the refueling of the reactor at the Yongbyon site, 
Washington responded slowly and moderately. The Security Council 
was only convened three days later, and the announcement that it 
issued was a call to North Korea to slow the process, and not a 
warning that contained a threat. 
  Clearly, there is no quick and easy solution to the problem 
of North Korea. The way to handle Pyongyang's nuclear refusal 
must be many-sided, and it must rely on cooperation of the 
countries of the region, especially of Japan and China. The main 
deficiency of the Clinton administration in the foreign sphere 
is its weakness in creating international coalitions. This 
weakness reflects the entire range of problems of the 
administration in the foreign sphere. For the building of a 
coalition requires trust and credibility between Washington and 
each of the potential members of the coalition, and such 
credibility is built up by a strong and stable foreign policy, 
by determination and perseverance, by radiating leadership. 
These characteristics are lacking in the relations of the U.S.A. 
both with its friends and with its rivals. 
  China celebrated recently the victory of its strong stand 
against the hesitant American pressures in the sphere of human 
rights, when Clinton ended the connection between the trade 
relations with Beijing and the human rights situation there. The 
U.S.A.'s European allies "reached the conclusion that they 
cannot work constructively with this administration," in the 
words of the commentator Jim Hoagland in the newspaper THE 
WASHINGTON POST, "and they are simply trying to suffer it in 
silence." 
  The place to rehabilitate the credibility of the United 
States is not the blood-soaked shores of Normandy, but the 
Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Article by Tzvi Moses] </F>
  [Text] The swift-moving events of our generation are 
producing rapid changes demanding a high level of adjustment. 
The outstanding example of this is the technological-economic 
sphere, which is indirectly affecting our social and spiritual 
life. Our language and the culture of interpersonal relations 
are changing, with implications for the political and national 
sphere as well. 
  Hayim Ramon overran the old and hated fort of the Histadrut 
and gave a green light to speeding up replacement of the 
leadership of the old and intermediate generations. We can look 
forward to further assaults bringing down the strongholds of the 
old Zionism, to dissolution of the Histadrut, the Palmach, which 
had seemed wiped out to all of us, the Jewish Agency and the 
rest of Zionism's archaeological relics. In his impulsive 
reaction to the state comptroller, Rabin reminded everyone that 
he still belongs to the old Palmach boys. The terms "monkey's 
uncle" and "drivel" are indeed native Israeli, but old-fashioned. 
  The right camp is stuck in a desperate struggle to block the 
"peace train," which naturally, and as expected, has been built 
in and stops at the Gaza and Jericho stations. One may hope for 
"Gaza and Jericho first--and last," at least during the current 
government's term. 
  The right camp, in its conservatism, must not preserve the 
party institutions' outdated structure. National feedback 
circles must be created, the public must be stirred with ideas. 
Perhaps the Meymad movement and the Takhelet circle will 
generate momentum leading, in time, to "new life" in the center 
and the right, but every other initiative and mass ferment is to 
be blessed in this transition period. 
  Religious Zionism finds itself at a crossroads. The NRP's 
[National Religious Party] exclusion from the government is 
causing a crisis in many spheres of activity in which the 
national religious public [as published] had been a leading 
factor. One may hope that the natural processes that will make 
"Gaza and Jericho first--and last" will enable a new settlement 
scheme to take the socioideological place of religious Zionism. 
The time has come to mark whether the national religious public 
is advancing religious Zionism or, on the contrary, burying it 
in a corner of the national right. In the past, the role of 
"counterweight" permitted religious Zionism to stand in the 
center of the map. It may be that what is needed today is 
integration into the major parties in order to spearhead the new 
Zionism. This issue must be put on the agenda in the upcoming 
party elections. The national religious public's success depends 
on the extent of the public's disgust with the big parties, but 
on the scale of a midsize to small party, a situation will be 
perpetuated in which the national religious public exists by 
grace of the government. 
  One of the areas in which the NRP is an initiator and leader 
is that of immigration and Jewish-Israeli activity within the 
former Soviet Union. The Labor Party's myopia on this issue is 
typified by the conduct and attitude of Deputy Education 
Minister Mikha Goldman, and reached a peak regarding youth 
immigration, about which I wrote in a previous article 
(published 12 May 1994). In that article, I called for "new 
life" in the Jewish Agency and for youth immigration with Rabin 
in peace." The reply of Eli 'Amir, who is in charge of youth 
immigration, to the article "National Project," which was 
published in HATZOFE on 26 May 1994, argues for a "national 
monopoly" of the Jewish Agency and youth immigration. This 
monopoly is a sure prescription for atrophy, mediocrity, and a 
low level of services. There is no need in the modern period and 
the current situation of "expiatory fowl" to engage in a "cock 
fight"; what we need is to foster a healthy competition between 
two plans. In the case of immigration and immigration 16, the 
very one who feared a professional defeat took advantage of his 
proximity to authority and obtained a political, nonprofessional 
decision. Israeli society's great fear is that the "expiatory 
fowl" of the various immigration bureaus will undergo a negative 
psychological process of "identifying with the aggressor," the 
authority culture of those who receive them. Such psychological 
dynamics will perpetuate the culture of "expiatory fowl," and 
the only thing that will change is the sacrifice of the week. 
  Eli 'Amir's rhetoric demonstrates that he has become more of 
a Mapainik than the Mapainiks. That is not big news for students 
of youth immigration. On the contrary, the culture of 
immigration absorption in Israel, which is causing an outbreak 
of delayed aggression by those absorbed, and by no means in 
creative and positive channels, has to be changed. We need a 
culture of authority and absorption that is more refined, one in 
which Israeli society imbues immigrants with esprit de corps and 
opens itself to study and change. Direct, open and mutual 
absorption, not haughty and unilateral provision of shelter. The 
challenge for Yehi'el Leqet, acting chairman of the Jewish 
Agency, is to take measures before it is too late and to make 
reforms that will prevent him from being branded with the image 
of "the Haberfeld of the Jewish Agency." He now has on his desk 
the problem of youth immigration, which is one of the tests of 
his ability to absorb the spirit of the times. 
  Rabin, who is fighting for his position against 'Arafat, and 
was dragged down to 'Arafat's level of expression in 
Johannesburg, is incapable meanwhile of rising above himself, 
neither with youth immigration nor with the Palmach, not even at 
the expense of 'Arafat and the PLO. As the leader of a modern 
state with a new spirit, a vast center of power residing in his 
office, he finds it difficult to break free of both the near 
past, the Rabin-Peres camp, and the remote past, the days of the 
Palmach and the victory of the Six-Day War. Perhaps we are 
dealing with a crisis intrinsic in the office, as Nahum Barne'a 
and Shim'on Schiffer have analyzed in YEDI'OT AHARONOT, but the 
fear still exists that the problem is a deeper psychopolitical 
one. It is difficult to see how, without advisers and 
strong-willed younger men, he can adapt to a changing reality 
and guide a new Zionism, a Zionism that embraces management of a 
modern competitive economy and breathes fresh ideas into 
national values. It is reasonable to suppose, therefore, that 
new Zionism depends on "new life" and a young, fresh leadership.

<F P=106> [Article by Pinhas 'Inbary: "Among Themselves"] </F>
  [Text] One does not have to be a prophet in order to know 
that the problem of Jerusalem will not wait until the time that 
was determined for it in the Oslo agreements, and that earlier 
than can be imagined, Israeli will have to seriously discuss 
possible solutions. Despite all the strident declarations, and 
the swearing of oaths by these or other Israeli leaders on the 
issue of Jerusalem, it must be clear to everyone: without a 
solution that will satisfy the Arabs, not only will there be no 
permanent solution for the Palestinian problem, but also the 
entire peace process cannot be realized, in the final analysis. 
  In fact, already this week one aspect of the problem of 
Jerusalem arose when Israel warned Palestinians not to establish 
the institutions of the Gaza and Jericho region in East 
Jerusalem. Doubt arose as to the status of the center of the 
Palestinian delegation in Orient House. To the Palestinians, it 
seemed that Israel was demanding the closure of Orient House, 
and they announced that this center was established before the 
Oslo and the Cairo agreements, and, therefore, those agreements 
have no standing regarding everything connected with its 
activity. 
  When the matters are clarified with the Israeli sources, it 
turns out that Orient House indeed constitutes a serious problem 
for Israel. But what especially angered Israel were two orders 
of the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, regarding the establishing of 
Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem--one of the 20th of 
the month, on the establishing of a statistical center attached 
to Orient House, and the second of 16 January, regarding the 
establishing of an institution for environmental research, 
headed by Dr. Gi'ad Ishak, the head of the Palestinian 
delegation to the talks on matters of environmental quality, 
within the framework of the multinational convention. Out of 
this Israeli-Palestinian dispute an additional impression is 
liable to arise, as if the struggle for Jerusalem is mainly 
between Israel and the Arabs. But reality is much more 
complicated, and one of the main problems that will confront 
Israel one day will be the lack of an Arab address that is 
agreed to by all of the Arab forces. 
<H5>  A Nucleus for an Alternative Leadership </H5>
  On 30 May, the daily AL-QUDS published a small item, 
according to which the PLO is preparing the file on the Muslim 
Waqf and the Christian property in East Jerusalem for the 
discussions about Jerusalem in the stage of the talks on the 
permanent arrangement. Dr. Walid Khalidi is preparing this file, 
after he searched for about a year in the Khalidi library in the 
Old City. Khalidi, according to the report, will join the 
Palestinian delegation on the permanent talks. 
  The item seems innocent, but it is not. This, in fact, is a 
declaration of war over the status of Jordan, as the Waqf 
administration in East Jerusalem is attached to the Jordanian 
ministry of religions, and King Hussein has emphasized the 
Hashemites' historical responsibility for the holy places in 
Jerusalem. The choice of Dr. Khalidi also is not innocent, 
because his family is related to the Arab military leader Khaled 
Ben al-Walid, one of the Muslim conquerors of Jerusalem in the 
time of the Calif 'Omar. It is still too early to determine 
whether Dr. Khalidi will indeed be ready to join the war between 
the PLO and Jordan over the representation of the Jerusalem 
problem, but the smell of gunpowder is already in the air--not 
between Israel and the Arabs, but precisely between the PLO and 
Jordan. 
  'Arafat's two orders, which were the reason for the 
unofficial Israeli warning, are also not innocent. Al-Husayni 
and Ashrawi made it clear that Orient House was established 
before the Oslo agreements, while 'Arafat's orders were issued 
after Oslo. 
  It is customary to regard al-Husayni as 'Arafat's 
representative in East Jerusalem, and Orient House as a direct 
branch of Tunis. There is no doubt that al-Husayni represents 
the PLO, and his political battles are within the framework of 
the PLO and on behalf of the PLO. But in the struggles within 
the PLO, al-Husayni and 'Arafat are in opposing camps. There is 
no PLO decision to establish a center for the Palestinian 
delegation, and the vague name "Orient House" is not accidental. 
'Arafat relates to al-Husayni and to the center that he 
established in East Jerusalem as the nucleus for an alternative 
leadership, and this center worries 'Arafat no less than Israel. 
Not a small portion of the heating up of the problem of the 
status of Orient House does not only stem from objective 
reasons. This does not mean that 'Arafat is seeking to repress 
the problem of Jerusalem--the contrary is true--but that he 
wants to lead a struggle that will overshadow Orient House. 
'Ar'afat's determination to move forward the dealing with the 
status of Jerusalem stems, apparently, from his desire not to 
allow Orient House to lead this struggle. 
  As far as is known, the PLO did not give a penny of support 
for Orient House, and it is rather indifferent to the sight of 
its economic difficulties. It seems that all of the support that 
al-Husayni has received for the maintenance of Orient House has 
come from the Gulf. The institution, in any event, is still sunk 
in debts. 
<H5>  Al-Husayni Versus al-Rajub </H5>
  The status of Orient House arises now also due to the 
internal Palestinian struggle in the territories. Among the 
changes that occurred recently was the return of the chief of 
the Palestinian Shabak in the West Bank, Jibril al-Rajub. About 
a week ago, al-Husayni participated alongside al-Rajub, in the 
ceremony for the founding of the Palestinian Shabak office in 
Jericho. In front of those present, a dispute arose between 
these two. Al-Rajub said that he would extend his authority also 
to Jerusalem. Al-Husayni interrupted and said that the Orient 
House was established before Oslo and Cairo, and that, 
consequently, those agreements do not apply to it. Therefore, in 
the battle for Jerusalem are participating not only PLO factors 
inside and outside, but also persons who are struggling for 
supremacy in the territories, such as al-Husayni and al-Rajub. 
This competition has led to al-Husayni being compelled to take 
up al-Rajub's challenge, and that was the source of the concern 
of the minister of police, Moshe Shahal, over establishing 
Palestinian police frameworks in Jerusalem. 
  This internal competition also has inter-Arab implications. 
In getting organized against Jordan, 'Arafat seeks the aid of 
Saudi Arabia, while al-Husayni's relations with Jordan are 
improving. 'Arafat's courting of Saudi Arabia have not yet borne 
real fruit, and even after the meeting between 'Arafat and King 
Fahd, Saudi Arabia's assistance to the PLO remains very limited. 
  At the basis of the struggle between the Hashemites and the 
Saudis is the struggle over the legitimacy of the guardians of 
the holy places. Saudi Arabia is undermining Jordan's status in 
Jerusalem, in order to defend its legitimacy in Hijaz, from 
which it expelled the Hashemites at the turn of the century. 
King Hussein recently expressed several times a formula, which 
could bring about a reconciliation with the Saudis. He referred 
on two occasions to King Fahd as "the servant of the holy 
places" (in Hijaz). Recently, King Hussein also did not repeat 
his anti-Saudi rhetoric, and the impression was made as if the 
efforts at reconciliation between the two dynasties are 
continuing. 
<H5>  `Just Not the PLO' </H5>
  On the question of who will represent the Arabs on the 
subject of Jerusalem, it is impossible to err regarding Jordan's 
position--just not the PLO. Against the PLO formula, which 
'Arafat repeated on Wednesday--that Jerusalem is the capital of 
the Palestinian state--Jordan states that the sovereignty over 
the holy places is only "for God." That is, it presents a 
formula of interreligious administration, whose nature is not 
yet clear. If, indeed, there are secret contacts for 
reconciliation between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, it may be that 
the two states are discussing the nature of this administration, 
without the participation of the PLO. 'Arafat himself admitted, 
at one of his meetings with the Palestinian delegation last 
year, that all of the Arab states--including Morocco and 
Syria--do not support the establishing of a Palestinian capital 
in Jerusalem, but rather Jerusalem being a pan-Arab and 
pan-Muslim center. 
  That position has a practical implication: for a long time, 
the PLO has sought to convene in Jerusalem a large and 
impressive economic conference, with central personalities such 
as Abu al-'Ala, but the conference was postponed repeatedly. 
Recently, there has again been talk of its convening, but 
Palestinian economic sources informed 'AL-HAMISHMAR that one of 
the reasons for the repeated postponements is Jordan's 
opposition to this conference in Jerusalem and not in 'Amman. 
  Jordan has not yet revealed all of its cards. It should be 
noted that it is trying to convince the Palestinians, as much as 
it can, to transfer the center of their political activities to 
Ramallah. According to Palestinian sources, Jordan is promising 
the Palestinians that the day will come when it will put on the 
negotiating table a proposal to extend Jerusalem's borders to 
Ramallah and Bethlehem; the Palestinian capital will be, from 
Israel's viewpoint, in Ramallah, but from the viewpoint of the 
Arab world it will be in Jerusalem; the holy places in Bethlehem 
would be included in the arrangement for intercommunal 
administration of the Old City. Meanwhile, the PLO is not 
accepting this position. 
  One way or another, the negotiations over Jerusalem have, in 
fact, already begun, not in an orderly manner, and not by purely 
diplomatic means--but it is a multilateral struggle: not only 
between the Arabs and Israel, but among themselves.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Jean-Pierre Tuquoi: </F>
"Morocco Beginning To Obtain Encouraging Economic 
Results"--first paragraph is LE MONDE introduction] 
  [Text] After 10 years of structural adjustment, Morocco is 
showing some encouraging economic results. Stimulated by an 
unusually good agricultural season, growth for 1994 should be 
close to 10 percent. But much remains to be done to overcome 
poverty, which has declined only slightly in recent years... 
  Casablanca--A largely agricultural country, Morocco is 
highly 
dependent on the weather, which has not been kind to the country 
recently, with severe drought two years in a row. By contrast, 
1994 shows signs of being an exceptionally good year, with a 
cereal harvest that could approach 100 million quintals, 
compared to less than 30 million the previous year. 
  The entire economy will get a shot in the arm from the 
"harvest of the century." With a bit of luck, the country's 
growth rate--depressingly negative for the last two years--could 
exceed 10 percent in 1994, according to unofficial projections. 
Such good news could not come at a better time for Morocco, 
which after defaulting on its international payments in 1983 
ended up spending 10 years implementing a structural adjustment 
plan under the aegis of the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  To judge by macroeconomic indicators, the austerity cure has 
borne fruit. The budget deficit is small (less than 2 percent of 
GDP in 1994 versus 13 percent in 1986), inflation is moderate, 
debt service absorbs a smaller and smaller share of export 
earnings, hard-currency reserves are up, and the national 
currency, the dirham, is well on its way to complete 
convertibility. 
  One sign of the international community's newfound 
confidence 
in Morocco: The country is beginning to attract foreign capital. 
The sums involved are still relatively modest: $500 million in 
investments last year, or about 3 billion [French] francs. But 
they have been enough to stabilize the balance of payments. More 
important, the totals are growing rapidly: "Between 1990 and 
1994, foreign investment increased fivefold," says Mohammed 
Sagou, minister of finance. This manna should have a tonic 
effect on the Casablanca Stock Exchange. The exchange, housed in 
a splendid colonial edifice in the heart of the nation's 
economic capital, has never regained the luster of its earliest 
days, nearly six decades ago. Today, it rouses from its torpor 
for only one hour a day, in late afternoon, when some twenty 
stock brokers--one of them a woman--gather around the brokers' 
enclosure the way friends congregate at a cafe. 
<H5>  Accelerate Privatization </H5>
  More than 60 enterprises are listed on the official 
exchange, 
but in practice trading is limited to about twenty of them. And 
such transactions! The banks, which are the primary 
shareholders, are extremely conservative and can seldom be 
induced to sell any of their stock, for reasons having to do 
with the cost of transactions (there are ten offers to purchase 
for every offer of sale). The dearth of stock fuels a steady 
increase in share prices. "On average since 1987, the index has 
risen close to 30 percent per year," says Amyn Alami, a young 
"golden boy" [preceding words in English] schooled in Paris 
whose ambition is to start a merchant bank in his native Morocco. 
  Artisanal and speculative, the Casablanca Exchange aspires 
to 
expansion and respectability. And it is counting on the 
privatization of state-owned enterprises to make it happen. In 
fact, privatization was launched close to four years ago, but 
progress has been so slow that to date only about a dozen 
enterprises--a number of them hotels--have been turned over to 
the private sector and (in some cases) listed on the stock 
exchange. "We're going to speed things up dramatically," says 
privatization minister Abderrahmane Saidi. "The law calls for 
privatizing 112 enterprises between now and the end of 1995. We 
will go even further. Already we are working on the next list. 
And every sector of activity will be considered." 
  The next series of privatizations will focus on the banking 
and financial system, in particular four banks[.sup]1[/] from 
which the state plans to disengage only partly. Other 
enterprises to be privatized include National Investment Company 
(SNI), a ubiquitous holding company involved in everything from 
agrofood to finance, and BTP [? 4-10 years treasury bonds], 
which Mr. Saadi does not hesitate to describe as a "pure jewel." 
SNI's value will be determined, in late June, by an appraisers' 
council composed of "men completely above suspicion," in hopes 
of bringing in private shareholders by September, the minister 
said. As in earlier privatizations, procedures will be modeled 
on the French practice, with creation of a "hard core" [i.e. 
long-term, big investors] and mechanisms to facilitate employee 
stock acquisition. 
  "Over the next two years, the number of firms quoted on the 
exchange will double," swears its director-general, Abderrazak 
Laraki. To prepare for the future, new equipment is being 
acquired--Reuter screens have started springing up around the 
central enclosure--and there are ambitious plans to relocate the 
exchange to an ultramodern building. 
  Most important, a suitable juridical environment is being 
fashioned, with everything from SICAVs [short-term mutual funds] 
and common money market funds to new accounting standards and an 
"ethics council" to ensure transparency of transactions. The 
council has its work cut out for it. Witness the example of CTM 
[Moroccan Transport Company], the national transport company 
privatized (successfully) just a year ago. "The company waited 
until 1994 to publish its 1992 financial position data," notes 
Jalal Houti, manager of Morocco's leading brokerage firm, Upline 
Securities. 
  The success of the exchange revitalization will be judged by 
how attractive it proves to foreign investors. The latter, so 
far, are not exactly falling over themselves to rush in--but 
neither are they turning their backs. Two SICAVs specializing in 
Moroccan securities have made their appearance in France in 
recent months; this spring, Salomon Brothers (United States) in 
partnership with ONA [North African Holding Company], Morocco's 
biggest private group, launched a $100-million fund, a part of 
which will be invested on the exchange; and financier George 
Soros has announced he would enter into discussions "with 
Moroccan governmental authorities on ways to participate in the 
privatizations." 
  In Morocco, the first privatizations excited more than just 
polite curiosity. More than 11,000 persons bought shares in CTM, 
and 15,000 purchased stock in SOFAC-Credit, a consumer loan 
company. All the same, little is really known about the new 
shareholders. Are they--as claims Abdelmajid Bouzoubaa, 
secretary-general of the CDT [Democratic Labor 
Confederation]--members of the "comprador bourgeoisie"? Or do 
they belong to that "middle class" that is already becoming an 
economic reality and someday will be a political force too? 
Sociological investigation is needed to answer that question.

<H5>  World Bank Report </H5>
  Since the mid-1980's, poverty in Morocco has declined. A 
generation ago, per capita GDP was only $500, and 6.5 million 
people were classed as "underprivileged." By 1991, the GDP had 
doubled, and only half as many people were living in poverty. 
But, as the World Bank is careful to note in a report--"Kingdom 
of Morocco: Poverty, Adjustment, and Growth"--published early 
this year, that represents only a "slight improvement," since 
close to 1.7 million people are living so close to the economic 
edge that they must be classified as "almost poor." 
  Unsurprisingly, the World Bank attributes Morocco's 
successes--obtained despite a very high rate of demographic 
growth and restrictions imposed by the adjustment policy--to a 
series of governments that were able to "stabilize the 
economy...undertake far-reaching structural reforms, 
and...maintain high economic growth." 
  The report highlights the growing disparities between urban 
and rural areas. "Poverty in Morocco is increasingly a rural 
phenomenon," the bank observes. 
  According to its calculations, seven out of 10 poor 
Moroccans 
live in rural areas. Another cleavage--and Moroccan leaders are 
well aware of it--is seen in the contrast between rich urban 
coastal areas, where the poor are no more than 5 percent of the 
population, and rural areas in north-central, eastern, and 
south-central Morocco, where poverty afflicts almost one out of 
every four inhabitants. 
  To ameliorate living conditions among the most 
disadvantaged, 
the bank preaches maintaining, to the maximum extent possible, 
sustained economic growth ("the most effective long-term cure 
for poverty"), while at the same time implementing specific 
programs to upgrade rural areas. For example, to slow down the 
rural exodus, the report suggests reducing the current 
50-percent gap between the minimum industrial wage and its 
agricultural equivalent. To deal with unemployment, a scourge 
that weakens the country and hits hardest those least able to 
cope, the bank urges Morocco to follow the example of other 
countries and expand public works programs "that employ 
unskilled manpower for below the minimum wage." [end box]

<F P=106> [Article: "Cannabis Cultivation Grows Despite Efforts of </F>
Moroccan Government"] 
  [Text] In October 1992, Morocco--France's largest supplier 
of hashish and the world's largest exporter of the 
drug--launched a campaign to suppress trafficking in this 
traditional local cash crop. In its soon-to-be-published annual 
report ("Etat des drogues, drogues des Etats", Collection 
Pluriel, Hachette, 120 French francs, 1994), the Geopolitical 
Drugs Observatory (OGD) concludes the monarchy's drug policy has 
shown little in the way of results. 
  It came as quite a surprise in October 1992 when King Hassan 
II announced, in a meeting with his principal ministers, the 
launching of a "relentless" war against drugs. Since then, the 
"surprise" has taken a long time to materialize, according to 
the OGD: "More surface area is devoted to cannabis cultivation 
than ever before, and the trafficking rings, which continue to 
enjoy protection from high-level officials, seem little affected 
by enforcement efforts that have focused mainly on low-level 
traffickers," notes the OGD, which works for various 
international institutions, in its annual report. 
  As successor to the Kif and Tobacco Authority established by 
the French colonial regime in 1926, Morocco's Agriculture 
Ministry each year reports the acreage devoted to each crop. 
Including "kif," as cannabis is called locally. Based on the 
ministry's official statistics, the regime disclosed in autumn 
1992 that the illicit crops were grown on some 50,000 hectares 
[ha]. 
  Despite Rabat's pronouncements, those crops are still there. 
In 1993, "cannabis covers at least 65,000 ha in northern 
Morocco," says the OGD, which was given access to data acquired 
by the ministry's Economic Statistics Service. Moreover, the 
total does not even take into account the increase in greenhouse 
cultivation of the illicit crops in the Agadir region which the 
U.S. State Department claims to have detected. The growth in kif 
cultivation far exceeds any increase that could be attributed to 
traditional usage, since in 1980 illicit plots covered only 
5-10,000 ha. 
<H5>  Short-Lived Zeal </H5>
  In their "relentless war" on drugs, Moroccan authorities 
have shown little staying power. Admittedly, some 5,000 soldiers 
were deployed between the Algerian border and Tangier, and 
corrupt high-level officials were dismissed or transferred. The 
first half of 1993 also saw a significant increase in highway 
checkpoints in the northern part of the country. And there were 
a handful of spectacular enforcement operations, mostly against 
Europeans found in possession of small quantities of the drug. 
  "But zeal for enforcement disappeared with the onset of 
summer and harvest time," notes the OGD, which also points out 
that "enforcement efforts mostly targeted small-time trafficking 
rings... At the same time, a number of notorious traffickers 
were haled into court only to be acquitted, a development that 
surprised almost everyone." The conclusion: Not only do 
"increasing well-organized Moroccan rings engage in 
international marketing of derivatives of cannabis produced in 
Morocco," but "this increase in trafficking would not have been 
possible without pervasive corruption at all levels of the 
bureaucracy." 
  Breaking with the habitual passivity of Moroccan authorities 
in this domain, the royal promises of autumn 1992 were meant to 
impress the international community, especially the European 
Union. Rabat expected its commitment would lead to large 
assistance inflows both to fight the drug rings and to stimulate 
development in the northern provinces, where kif as a 
monoculture had undeniably improved the peasants' standard of 
living. But it seems that Morocco, reverting to its traditional 
position in the matter, has decided for now to remain the 
world's largest cannabis exporter. The interior minister has 
told his European interlocutors that if present trends 
persist--with Italy and Germany apparently inclined to follow 
Netherlands' lead and decriminalize hashish--it would be a 
mistake for Morocco to eradicate crops that may sometime be 
legal in Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, Sudanese al-Ummah </F>
Party Secretary General, by Nizar Daw-al-Na'im; place and date 
not given--first two paragraphs are AL-HAYAH introduction] 
  [Text] London--Dr. 'Umar Nur-al-Da'im, secretary general of 
Sudan's opposition al-Ummah Party and ex-finance minister, has 
asserted that "there is no place for a bilateral formula between 
the Islamic Front and al-Ummah party" and that his party's call 
for civil struggle [jihad madani] and a popular uprising against 
President 'Umar al-Bashir's regime continues to exist and "we 
have to be more optimistic and have to hope to topple the regime 
at the lowest cost." He expressed the opinion that the 
government is the party that first raised the issue of self- 
determination for the south. 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Dr. Nur-al-Da'im said that 
the 
Democratic National Grouping [DNG] "is experiencing 
organizational problems and disputes." He criticized the fact 
that "some Coordination Committee members engage in executive 
tasks and issue statements in the Grouping's name. He said that 
his party faults Faruq Abu-'Isa, who headed the DNG meetings 
recently, for "holding contacts and making statements in his 
capacity as the DNG executive chairman." He also criticized the 
Communist Party severely and urged it not to intervene in his 
party's affairs. Here is the text of the interview: 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] What is your assessment of Sudan's conditions 
and what is the solution you offer for the country's problems? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] To date, we have lived nearly five years 
under 
the umbrella of the NIF [National Islamic Front], which staged a 
fascist military coup and proclaimed specific goals in its first 
communique--goals which included achievement of peace and 
elimination of the citizens' hardship and of the government's 
isolation. But secretly, the NIF's goal was to establish an 
Islamic society that would act as a model for the world's 
cultural tendency. But the outcome has been collapse in all 
spheres of humanitarian activity and the spread of corruption 
and maladies. Peace has become inaccessible and a terrorist 
autocratic regime has come into existence instead of an Islamic 
state. The NIF has committed suicide after 50 years of action. 
This is the crisis. The cure is achieved by developing a formula 
to ensure the restoration of peace and to liquidate the 
tyrannical state established by the NIF. A stable climate is the 
basis for a new beginning in development and construction. There 
is no magic wand to repair the damage. Sudan's political 
movement is aware of the developments occurring in today's 
world. Therefore, DNG plans and other parties' and unions' plans 
must be presented at a comprehensive conference in which the 
Sudanese, who seek freedom, agree on the future. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] Does your call for civil struggle against the 
regime still exist? What does this call mean? Will you accept a 
reconciliation formula that brings the government and the 
opposition together to deal with the situation? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] Our call for civil struggle continues to 
exist 
and to escalate. The final outcome will be a popular revolution 
similar to the revolutions that the Sudanese people have come to 
master and that they have already staged twice. Struggle against 
the dictatorship is of two kinds: the first is military and it 
is taking place in the south. The second is civil and it is 
taking place in the north. We have to be more optimistic and we 
have to hope to topple the regime at the lowest cost. The 
socialist camp governments were toppled within months by popular 
uprisings and by the so-called peaceful resistance. This is what 
brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi (former prime minister and al-Ummah 
Party chairman) has called civil struggle. What happened during 
'Id al-Fitr prayers, when al-Mahdi led nearly 1 million persons 
in prayer, whereas al-Bashir led no more than 1,000 persons less 
than three kilometers away, confirms that the Muslim masses 
support the al-Mahdi sect and not the NIF, the original and not 
the imported. There is no place for any bilateral formula 
between the NIF and al-Ummah Party, especially since the base of 
al-Ummah Party, which consists of the al-Ansar supporters, has 
considered confiscation of Imam al-Mahdi's Dome, al-Khalifah 
Mosque, and the al-Ansar Affairs Council building an aggression 
against the creed. The NIF is responsible for offending the 
Sudanese people's values. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] Many speak of points of agreement between you 
and the NIF. What are these points and what are the subjects of 
disagreement? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party is one of Sudan's and 
Africa's biggest parties. It is a popular and broad-based 
democratic party with Arab, Islamic, and African tendencies. It 
has dealt with the NIF as it dealt with SANU [Sudan African 
National Union]. But after reconciliation with (former 
President) Ja'far Numayri, we disagreed on the future of Islam 
in Sudan. The NIF encouraged Numayri and pledged its allegiance 
to him as imam, whereas we decided that Islam can only flourish 
under the canopy of freedom. We, whether in the government or in 
the opposition, have cooperated with the NIF respectfully. Our 
party helped the NIF and protected it from communist oppression. 
But regrettably, the NIF has chosen the path of coups and of 
imposing its will by force. The collapse in the various aspects 
of life and the humiliation the citizen is experiencing have 
created a deep chasm between the NIF and al-Ummah Party in the 
political and Islamic spheres. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] You recently proposed a formula for an 
agreement with the southerners in which you call for a 
referendum on self-determination in four years. Has this formula 
been accepted by the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] The al-Ummah Party chairman Sadiq al-Mahdi 
presented a complete peace plan in the wake of the failure of 
the first Abuja talks and when it became evident that the regime 
was offering, in the absence of the country's main forces, a 
deficient and limited vision that couldn't be accepted by the 
southern movement. The al-Ummah Party's plan focuses on a 
solution through consent among the Sudanese people. It also 
focuses on democracy; political, cultural, religious, and ethnic 
plurality; regional decentralism; federalism and confederalism; 
and on establishing citizenship as the basis. If war is the only 
alternative, then self-determination has to be considered in the 
light of permanent peace. 
  The NIF proceeded to raise the self-determination issue at 
the Frankfurt talks that were held at the beginning of 1992 
(between the government and the al-Nasir wing of the SPLM). This 
was the first time that the self-determination issue gained 
weight. Meanwhile, the war continued and the regime proceeded to 
touch off the religious and holy war dimension. The southerners 
united behind the call for self-determination that was 
introduced by the regime into the Sudanese political agenda for 
the first time ever. Brother Mubarak al-Mahdi submitted the 
al-Ummah Party formula to a session of the British House of 
Lords. This formula enables self-determination to proceed in the 
direction of Sudan's unity instead of the direction of 
separation. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] You have said repeatedly that external 
opposition is an arm of the internal opposition. What is the 
external opposition's task and what has it accomplished? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] In light of the domestic oppression, the 
fascism established by the regime, and the suppression of 
opponents, and even of disgruntled supporters, such as Mahjub 
'Urwah, his faction, and his paper, AL-SUDANI AL-DUWALI, it is 
normal that the external opposition's voice would be heard 
clearly because this opposition is free to move. There is no 
doubt that the external arm of the DNG has accomplished several 
things, especially in exposing the deceptive image the regime 
has used to project itself abroad. This arm has also succeeded 
in condemning the regime's escalation of the war in the south 
and of its introduction of the religious dimension into this 
war, in defending human rights, and in projecting the Sudanese 
people's struggle for freedom. 
  When opposition action escalated and came to be in need of a 
strong executive decisionmaking instrument, the DNG decided to 
work through a coordination committee to replace its 
minimal-level coordination. This led to the talk about 
restructuring the DNG abroad. It had been agreed to settle this 
issue at a conference, which was scheduled to take place last 
November. But the war circumstances prevented its convocation. 
The al-Ummah Party has noticed that some coordination committee 
members have been recently engaging in executive tasks and 
making statements in the Grouping's name. We have already warned 
that it is necessary to end such acts. Moreover, the al-Ummah 
Party has presented to the Grouping forces abroad a memorandum 
that contains specific proposals and observations on how to end 
such actions until the structure is completed. This is a 
legitimate issue that can be debated. There is no place for 
sensitivities in public action. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] Why have you called for ousting Faruq 
Abu-'Isa 
from the DNG leadership and what do you mean by saying that "he 
lacks neutrality?" 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] Nobody slights the role that brother Abu-'Isa 
has played within the DNG, especially in defending human rights 
and upholding the opposition's banner. But what the al-Ummah 
Party faults Abu-'Isa for is that he has made contacts and 
issued statements in his capacity as DNG executive chairman. The 
fact is that brothers Abu-'Isa and Bona Maloual were selected to 
manage the sessions of a meeting held in Addis Ababa. The 
al-Ummah Party has decided that since Maloual has withdrawn and 
since Abu-'Isa has promoted himself to the position of DNG 
executive chairman, then the chairmanship is supposed to be 
periodic so embarrassment will be avoided. It isn't surprising 
that the external Communist Party would issue a statement 
defending brother Abu-'Isa, one of this party's historical 
leaders. What is surprising is that the Communist Party would 
dish out charges against brother Mubarak al-Mahdi, al-Ummah 
Party's representative abroad, and that it would turn the issue 
into a personal issue. Brother al-Mahdi and the team that leads 
al-Ummah Party's action abroad don't need the Communist Party to 
evaluate their performance because they have shouldered the main 
part of the burden to strengthen the DNG procession and the 
opposition leadership. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] Accusations have been made against Mubarak 
al-Mahdi because he has firm relations with the NIF. 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] Mubarak al-Mahdi's relations with the NIF 
aren't personal relations. The al-Ummah Party Political Bureau 
has assigned Mubarak, along with Dr. Hasan Taj-al-Din and Dr. 
Shaykh Mahjub, to take charge of relations with the NIF. The 
party has assigned and Dr. Adam Musa Mawbu and me to follow up 
on the relations with the [Democratic] Unionist Party. It has 
also assigned brother Bakri 'Adil, Sarah al-Fadil, and Dr. 
Bashir 'Umar to tend to relations with the Communist Party, the 
Nasirist Revival [Ba'th] Party, and the National Party. With 
this twisted logic, we can list 'Adil and his team as supporters 
of the Communist Party. I urge the Communist Party not to 
embroil itself in such issues. We have expected that with the 
lapse of five years since the end of internationalism, the 
Communist Party would introduce us to its new position instead 
of allowing itself to enter into labyrinths that make us suspect 
that this party still doesn't believe in democracy. 
  There is no doubt that the DNG is experiencing 
organizational 
problems and disagreements on how to deal with newly developing 
issues, such as the self-determination issue. However, such 
problems accompany every organization and movement. Opposition 
action has its numerous channels at home and abroad, and these 
channels have never been blocked. Regardless of whether the DNG 
is restructured or not, and regardless of whether the ambition 
of some individuals or factions makes them play or not play a 
role that is not assigned to them, the opposition procession at 
home and abroad will continue and will achieve results in 
defeating the regime that has begun to collapse and to be eroded 
by the power of the Sudanese people. 
  [Dar-al-Na'im] The al-Ummah Party deputy chairman 
Nasr-al-Din 
al-Hadi recently made statements in which he criticized you and 
the official in charge of external action. What is your opinion? 
  [Nur-al-Da'im] Brother Nasr-al-Din remained silent for ages 
and then opened his mouth only to utter a blasphemy. Like the 
Communist Party, he has moved to defend brother Abu-'Isa. We 
believe that he departed from Sudan to oppose the al-Ummah 
Party, not the regime. He has had no connection with the party's 
action at home or abroad. He has tried to dispute legitimacy of 
the party's institutions. Nasr-al-Din formed a small team, which 
he called the collective party leadership. But this team didn't 
survive long because its objective was to impede the role of the 
opposition al-Ummah Party and to serve the Front. As for 
Nasr-al-Din's talk about my appointment as chairman of the 
party's General Secretariat, it isn't true that I was selected. 
I won the majority of the votes in accordance with the party 
constitution. Responsibilities were divided and I became the 
General Secretariat chairman and the official in charge of the 
Political Department and Nasr-al-Din became finance secretary. 
  When organizational performance was affected after most 
General Secretariat members entered the Cabinet, a committee 
that had reviewed the party performance recommended cancellation 
of the general secretariat system and reinstatement of the 
general secretary and deputy general secretary system. Party 
institutions approved this recommendation and selected me as 
secretary general and selected brother Bakri 'Adil as my deputy. 
At the time, an advisory presidential council was formed under 
the chairmanship of al-Sadiq al-Mahdi and it included previous 
secretariat members who hadn't been assigned any executive 
duties. Brother al-Sadiq al-Mahdi appointed brother Nasr-al-Din 
as his deputy in managing this council's sessions. Therefore, 
Nasr-al-Din wasn't the party deputy chairman, as he alleges. 
This position doesn't exist in the party constitution. It is 
regrettable that brother Nasr-al-Din al-Mahdi has come out to 
offend the party and its leaders. I have the honor to support 
the position of Mubarak al-Mahdi and his team. This is the least 
that the al-Ummah Party secretary general can do.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with former South Yemeni President 'Ali </F>
Nasir Muhammad, by Hasan Sabra; place and date not--first three 
paragraphs are AL-SHIRA' introduction] 
  [Text] Former [South] Yemeni President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad 
warns of the perils of the ongoing war in Yemen, asserting that 
the "Yemeni states" that the ongoing war threatens to create 
pose a threat to the entire region. 
  In a telephone interview with AL-SHIRA', the former Yemeni 
president asserted that the crisis will be resolved through 
dialogue only and noted that the "entire Gulf is for Yemen's 
unity and for a peaceful solution to the problem." 
  Former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad pointed out that there 
are taboos in the ongoing war, saying that "whoever approaches 
the oil fields commits suicide" and that "it is difficult to 
establish a fundamentalist regime in Yemen." Following is the 
text of the interview: 
  [Sabra] What is your information on the progress of the war? 
Will it turn into a war of attrition and of positions? Is there 
a possibility of resolving it? 
  [Muhammad] What is going on now is attrition of Yemen's 
military and material resources. The balance of power is what 
will determine the course of the war on the ground. 
  [Sabra] There is talk now about a salvation government in 
the 
southern part of the country. Do you think that the return of 
each part to its previous borders is projected as a solution? 
  [Muhammad] In principle, I am opposed to separation. I was 
the first to sign the 1972 unity accord. My name has been tied 
to numerous unity accords, to a united Yemen, and to some other 
accords. I am opposed to secession. 
  [Sabra] How are matters proceeding now? 
  [Muhammad] The issue is no longer an issue of separation of 
North from South or of returning to the pre-1990 condition. 
  [Sabra] There is repeated talk about mini-states. 
  [Muhammad] Yes, Yemen may break up. 
  [Sabra] Hadhramaut may become a state, for example, Ta'izz a 
state, and Aden a state? 
  [Muhammad] Yes, more than one state may come into existence 
and they may become a source of concern for the entire region 
because of the strategic position Yemen occupies in the Red Sea, 
the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Horn of Africa, and the 
Arab Peninsula. 
  [Sabra] If there is danger from this war to the countries 
adjacent to Yemen, then can these countries intervene and is it 
possible that the entire issue will seem to be an invitation to 
the neighboring countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] My information is that the neighboring countries 
have declared their support for unity and that they are for 
resolving the problem [peacefully]. GCC [Gulf Cooperation 
Council] statements, the statements of Saudi sources in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and of all the other countries support 
a peaceful solution to the problem. I haven't personally heard 
of any plans for intervention. 
  [Sabra] Christopher has said that there are some countries 
that help the South and others that help the North and that 
weapons from neighboring countries are being amassed by the 
Southerners and the Northerners. What do these statements mean? 
  [Muhammad] I know nothing specific about this issue. If the 
Americans have learned of this matter, then I don't have 
adequate information on the accumulation of weapons on both 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Pelletreau [U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state 
for Near Eastern Affairs] arrived in Muscat in this period 
during which war is flaring in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I believe that his visit to Muscat came as a part 
of a tour of the region. He also visited Yemen, Muscat, the UAE 
[United Arab Emirates], Doha, and Bahrain. 
  [Sabra] Accidentally or what? 
  [Muhammad] I don't think that Pelletreau planned the tour to 
coincide with the battles in Yemen. He happened to be in the 
region on the first day in which the battles erupted. 
  [Sabra] Do you think that the war broke out because the 
south 
wants to return to the pre-1990 condition and because the north 
wants to control both parts of Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In fact, I am opposed to the names North and 
South. 
  [Sabra] Well then, let us call them the YSP [Yemeni 
Socialist 
Party] in the South and the GPC [General Peoples Congress] in 
the North. 
  [Muhammad] The problem isn't a problem of North and South. 
We 
are now a single people in Yemen. We can talk about the dispute 
between the YSP and the GPC. 
<H5>  They All Use Excuses </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the YSP want of the war? 
  [Muhammad] They all use the Pledge and Accord Document as an 
excuse. They all emphasize the issue of implementing the 
Document. The YSP puts the emphasis on implementing the Pledge 
and Accord Document. 
  [Sabra] But what has happened is the opposite. 
  [Muhammad] In one of my interviews with AL-SHIRA', I said 
that the Pledge and Accord Document needs institutions to 
implement it. I said that if the institutions, such as the 
Presidential Council, the Cabinet, and the House of 
Representatives don't agree, the alternative will be anarchy, 
tension, and war. 
  [Sabra] It seems that agreement has turned into a devouring 
act. 
  [Muhammad] What we are interested in is agreement, harmony, 
understanding, and dialogue. 
  [Sabra] Is there still a chance of understanding and 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue is always open, and it can 
never be shut. 
  [Sabra] Even if 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih reaches the gates of 
Aden and occupies it? 
  [Muhammad] The door of dialogue remains open. People fight 
and then engage in dialogue. 
  [Sabra] When 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih occupies Aden, what 
dialogue will there be? 
  [Muhammad] I embrace the principle and I mean that the door 
of dialogue remains open. I am not talking of who will occupy 
what 
  [Sabra] Dialogue is possible if there is equality between 
the 
two sides. But if the situation turns into a situation where 
there is a victor and a vanquished, then there will be 
capitulation, not dialogue. 
  [Muhammad] One statement I have heard is that they haven't 
closed the door of dialogue with the YSP. In his latest 
statement, which I have heard through the media and on 
television, the House of Representatives speaker said that he 
will not close the door of dialogue with the YSP. 
  [Sabra] But words change completely when one of the two 
parties is fighting at the gates of the other party's capital. 
In this instance, the language of dialogue is suspended and the 
language of bone-crushing begins. So, is there a possibility of 
dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] I still stress the principle of dialogue. There 
can be no solution without dialogue, even under the canopy of 
war. 
  [Sabra] This is true. But who will conduct the dialogue? 
  [Muhammad] Didn't you have war and conflicts in Lebanon and 
wasn't there dialogue afterwards? 
  [Sabra] Yes, but Syria entered Lebanon and conducted 
dialogue 
among the parties concerned after separating the combatants and 
ending the war. Do you think that there is an Arab country that 
can lead the dialogue in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] In Yemen, Arab countries and the Arab League can 
help the country overcome this crisis through dialogue, because 
intervention will not help resolve the crisis. 
  [Sabra] What is the mechanism for Arab intervention? An Arab 
League delegation arrived in Yemen and stayed there for four 
days, but 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih didn't receive it. Salih didn't 
answer Egyptian President Husni Mubarak for four full days. 
  [Muhammad] But he did receive the delegation recently. 
  [Sabra] He received it on Husni Mubarak's insistence. It 
took 
him four days to answer Mubarak's telephone call! This means 
that he rejects any dialogue and any intervention by another 
party. In your opinion, can an Arab country, such as Egypt, 
Syria, or Saudi Arabia, conduct dialogue between the two sides 
after putting a halt to the war first? 
  [Muhammad] Efforts by Egypt and Syria and, as I have already 
pointed out, by the countries which contributed initially, such 
as Amman [Jordan] and Oman, are needed. 
  [Sabra] How about the United States and France who have 
their 
observers? 
  [Muhammad] And the UAE and the Arab League as well. 
  [Sabra] And what about Saudi Arabia? 
  [Muhammad] I urged the brothers in the GCC at an early phase 
to cooperate and help Yemen contain the crisis, because Yemen 
and the Arab Peninsula are like one body. If a part of the body 
is ailing, the rest of the body rallies to help it. 
  This is why I urge the brothers in the GCC to take any 
initiative to halt the war, to conduct dialogue, and to impose a 
peaceful solution. I have heard that they are eager to do so. 
<H5>  Opposed to Arab Forces in Yemen </H5>
  [Sabra] You have constantly opposed the presence of an Arab 
army to separate the combatants because Yemen is a single 
country and, therefore, there is no need for an Arab army. Do 
you still hold to your opinion? 
  [Muhammad] By God, I do. President Mubarak has said: we 
cannot be a policeman to separate the combatants. The Egyptians 
have asserted that they are not for the intervention of forces 
to separate the combatants. I still hold to my opinion because 
the problem will not be solved by Arab forces but by dialogue. 
The efforts of the Arab League committee can help. 
  [Sabra] When do you think the Arab countries will intervene? 
  [Muhammad] I have learned that the Arab League delegation 
returning from Sanaa has asserted that the door of dialogue has 
been reopened. 
  [Sabra] But this delegation was a military delegation, 
headed 
by Major General Sa'id Bayraqdar, former commander of the Syrian 
forces in Lebanon. What I mean is that this delegation has no 
political dimension. 
  [Muhammad] I have learned from reliable sources that Yemen 
has emphasized its willingness to receive a delegation from the 
Arab League and from the Arab countries. 
  [Sabra] Under the shadow of guns? 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi has 
stated that in all battles, dialogue takes place on the 
peripheries. It is dialogue under the canopy of war and guns. 
  [Muhammad] We went through this experience in the 1972 war, 
the 1979 war, and the 1981 war. There were battles and there was 
dialogue [simultaneously]. 
  [Sabra] Could the war last another month? 
  [Muhammad] In my experience as prime minister, there were 
wars with Sanaa. Through dialogue, we settled our problems and 
contained the crisis. 
  [Sabra] At the time, you were two states. Now, you are a 
single state in which one of the two sides excludes dialogue. It 
is the opinion of this side that the other side is a group of 
outlaws, not another state. 
  [Muhammad] We were two states, and yet we engaged in 
dialogue. Now, there is a coalition government that includes all 
sides. 
  [Sabra] Have you asked President Hafiz al-Asad to intervene 
in the Yemen issue? 
  [Muhammad] I haven't asked President al-Asad to intervene 
because Syria took the initiative on its own. Through telephone 
calls with President Salih and Vice President al-Bid and with 
the delegations dispatched to Damascus, President al-Asad has 
asserted that Syria is keen on Yemen's unity and on a peaceful 
resolution of the problems. 
  [Sabra] Is there a mechanism to activate this assertion and 
turn it into a reality? Do you imagine that Syria would send an 
army to Yemen to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] This question should be addressed to the Syrians. 
  [Sabra] Could you, as a [former] Yemeni official and a 
Yemeni 
conscience, ask Syria to send forces to separate the combatants? 
  [Muhammad] I couldn't make such a request officially. But by 
virtue of my friendship, I have urged the Syrian brothers to 
redouble their efforts to contain the crisis, not to dispatch 
forces. I cannot really talk about this issue. 
<H5>  My Supporters Here and There </H5>
  [Sabra] What does the presence of Brigadier General 
'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, who is one of your supporters, as defense 
minister mean? 
  [Muhammad] It means that he is the defense minister. 
  [Sabra] What does it mean to you? Were you consulted or is 
his appointment meant to please you and to solicit your 
participation? 
  [Muhammad] Brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur is a YSP Permanent 
Committee member. He is well known as my supporter, and I don't 
deny this. He is also a certified military capability in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] Was he selected on agreement with you? 
  [Muhammad] You know that during the honeymoon between the 
GPC 
and YSP in 1989 and after my departure from Sanaa to Damascus, 
there was, regrettably, a division... 
  [Sabra] Of power and weapons. 
  [Muhammad] And wealth and the clique. In the past, the 
brothers in Aden used to call my faction the "clique." 
  [Sabra] And you called them the "band." 
  [Muhammad] This is why I say they divided power, wealth, and 
the clique. 
  [Sabra] They ruined everything when they imitated 
al-Qadhdhafi... 
  [Muhammad] When some brothers, including 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur 
and Ahmad 'Abdallah al-Husayni, who was appointed navy commander 
recently, joined the GPC, other brothers joined the YSP, 
including Amin Hasan Yahya, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Qadir, and 
Muhammad 'Ali Ahmad, who are the latest to join the YSP. 
  [Sabra] Is this a Yemeni tactic? 
  [Muhammad] I have nothing to do with the way in which the 
brothers have shared the clique. I left it up to the colleagues 
to make their own choice, letting each select the party it 
wishes to join because political action is subsidiary action. 
  [Sabra] There are those who believe that when 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih settles the situation in the South finally and isolates 
the YSP, he will enlist your help so you will become the 
alternative. 
  [Muhammad] I am not interested in power. What interests me 
is 
a studies center. 
  [Sabra] You need a country to establish a studies center. 
Will there continue to be a Yemen so there can be a center? 
  [Muhammad] I am certain that Yemen will remain united, that 
the capital will be Sanaa, and that the center will be in Sanaa. 
But as to when the time to inaugurate the center will come, this 
is something that I will leave for the future. 
<H5>  Except Oil </H5>
  [Sabra] If the oil fields are exposed to danger, do you 
think 
the Americans will intervene, either directly or indirectly? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe the brothers will play with fire 
in this region. 
  [Sabra] Will these battles spare the oil fields? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted to get close to the oil 
fields. 
  [Sabra] And if they do? 
  [Muhammad] It isn't permitted. Moreover, this oil doesn't 
belong to the Americans. It belongs to the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] This is true theoretically. But practically, the 
Americans are the party that will benefit form the oil. 
  [Muhammad] The fires will not burn the Americans and [their] 
firms but the Yemeni people's interests and wealth. 
  [Sabra] Will the United States intervene to protect the 
Yemeni people's interests or its interests? 
  [Muhammad] I don't believe that the fires will get close to 
the oil fields. The battles that have taken place so far haven't 
affected the wells or the companies operating there. 
  [Sabra] If one of the two sides senses that it will lose the 
war, is it possible that this side could use the oil card to 
blackmail, pressure, or ambush other countries to intervene? 
  [Muhammad] It is my assessment that whoever does such a 
thing 
will commit suicide and will meet his end. Whoever thinks of 
such a thing is a madman who doesn't deserve respect and doesn't 
deserve to live in Yemen. 
  [Sabra] What is the solution to the current situation in 
Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] God knows. 
  [Sabra] It seems that you aren't pleased with the conditions 
in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] And neither are you. 
  [Sabra] When I first called you, you expressed your 
willingness to speak as if you possessed new given facts. 
  [Muhammad] All the statements are conflicting statements 
now. 
I believe that what is going on in Yemen now is a crime against 
the Yemeni people. 
  [Sabra] How do you explain the emergence of 'Abdallah 
al-Ahmar with such prominence in the past two days? 
  [Muhammad] He is one of the coalition leaders. 
  [Sabra] His statements have been so overwhelming they make 
it 
sound as if he is the actual ruler in Yemen. 
  [Muhammad] I don't think so. He is one of the parties to the 
ruling coalition. 
  [Sabra] Salim Salih says that Yemen is approaching a 
fundamentalist regime. 
  [Muhammad] It is difficult for me to confirm this. I don't 
believe that the fundamentalists can gain power. Anyway, the 
religious tendency is a participant in the coalition, with the 
GPC and YSP. 
  [Sabra] It is also a participant in the conflict. 
  [Muhammad] Yes. 
  [Sabra] Do Salim Salih's statements sort of incite the 
United 
States and the neighboring countries against the fundamentalists 
and scare them with the fundamentalist presence in Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] I have heard no such statements. 
  [Sabra] He made them this evening. 
  [Muhammad] It could be some sort of propaganda warfare. 
  [Sabra] May God protect Yemen from what is more dangerous. 
  [Muhammad] We appreciate your concern for Yemen and your 
followup on the situation there. 
  [Sabra] We have supported Yemen's unity enthusiastically. 
  [Muhammad] We are torn by the news we hear. My heart aches 
for Yemen because this issue concerns unity of the entire Arab 
nation. We appreciate your interest in and your followup on 
Yemen. We hope that problems will be solved, that the wounds 
will heal, and that we will meet soon. 
  [Sabra] God willing.

  [Text] At a meeting in Mukalla two days ago with Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, a UN factfinding envoy to Yemen, Southern commanders 
submitted a complete ceasefire plan to implement UN Security 
Council Resolution 924. Ibrahimi has delivered the text of the 
plan, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has acquired, to the 
Yemeni leadership in Sanaa. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has also learned that the plan has been 
distributed to the ambassadors of the permanent Security Council 
members, along with an attached message, so they can discuss it 
with their governments. 
  Following is the full text of the three items: 
<H5>  One, text of the memorandum conveyed by Ibrahimi to the UN </H5>
secretary general: 
  The Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] 
  The Premiership 
  Verbal Memorandum: 
  The DRY sends its warmest greetings to his excellency the UN 
secretary general and expresses to him its extreme happiness 
with the arrival of Lakhdar Ibrahimi as his envoy to the two 
parts of Yemen. 
  The DRY wishes to point out that the serious crisis the 
country has been experiencing is a result of the war that has 
been going on since 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih declared it in a public 
address he delivered at al-Sab'in Square in Sanaa on 27 April 
1994. 
  In this regard, we are eager to point out the following 
facts 
to open the way for a correct understanding of the causes that 
have necessarily led to the total collapse we are experiencing: 
  1. When Yemen's unity was proclaimed on 22 May 1990, our 
Yemeni people looked forward to creating a modern Yemeni 
state--a state of law and order in which all citizens have equal 
rights and duties and which sees to the country's development, 
progress, and prosperity. 
  2. At the time, leadership of the southern part of Yemen 
proceeded toward unity with our brothers in the northern part of 
the country confidently and responsibly in order to accomplish 
the great objective of establishing a united state on the basis 
of the unity accords signed by leaders of the two Yemeni states. 
  3. [As soon as] the Gulf crisis erupted, leadership of the 
former Yemen Arab Republic disavowed all the unity accords and 
worked with all means to impose its regime on the new state, 
thus reflecting negatively on the life of our people in the 
North and the South. 
  4. The national development and political, economic, 
administrative, and fiscal reform program that was passed by the 
House of Representatives on 15 December 1991 was an endeavor to 
deal with the problems that had emanated from the position of 
the leadership of the former northern part and to introduce 
political, economic, administrative, and fiscal reforms in order 
to create a modern state. 
  5. As soon as the government launched its effort, the minds 
that controlled the leadership of the former northern part and 
that opposed unity, development, and modernization launched an 
undeclared war against YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] leaders. 
This war has been embodied in political assassinations and in 
all kinds of terrorist acts that have touched even foreigners in 
Yemen. Fundamentalist Islamic forces have been used in terrorist 
acts. Despite all the endeavors to end this criminal series, the 
leadership of the former northern part refused to adopt any 
legal steps against suspects and those who support them. 
  6. The crisis peaked at the end of 1992, i.e., when 
parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held in November 
1992, in order to obstruct the elections or to hold them under 
unstable security conditions. 
  7. The situation was pacified so as to hold the 
parliamentary 
elections, which took place on 27 April 1993. Everybody aspired 
to seeing the country make strides on the path of reinforcing 
democratic action, of creating a united state, and of 
introducing economic reforms. 
  8. The leadership of the former northern part continued to 
cling to its position, and the chain of political assassinations 
and terrorist acts continued on the eve of the elections, thus 
convincing broad political forces in the Yemeni society that 
conditions were going to remain unchanged, and even become more 
complex, unless the influential forces abandoned their 
practices, put an end to terrorist acts, and ensured security 
and stability. 
  9. Political and security conditions became more complex, 
thus impeding political and economic life. But efforts to seek 
means and ways to overcome the crisis continued, and it was 
agreed to hold expanded political dialogue among the influential 
political forces in the Yemeni arena; two principles were agreed 
upon: (1) peaceful dialogue to develop cures; (2) renunciation 
of the use of weapons to impose solutions. 
  10. The Pledge and Accord Document was developed after 
serious and responsible dialogue, and it was signed in Jordan on 
20 February 1994. 
  11. Because of masked opposition, the influential forces 
refused to draft a program to normalize conditions and to 
implement the Document. So, political and economic conditions 
became tense and there were allusions made to the use of force. 
  12. After further dialogue, it was agreed to hold Cabinet 
meetings to begin implementing the Pledge and Accord Document in 
Aden, Ta'izz, and Sanaa. 
  13. The Cabinet held its first session from 23-27 March 1991 
[year as published] and a number of resolutions were adopted to 
implement the Document, despite the attempt to foil the Cabinet 
work. Military conditions were touched off in Shabwah on the eve 
of the Cabinet session. Seven people were killed, and a number 
of others were wounded. 
  14. The Cabinet held its second session from 6-7 April 1994. 
At this meeting, GPC [General People's Congress] and YRG [Yemeni 
Reform Grouping] representatives backed away from a number of 
resolutions to which it had agreed in Aden. On the eve of the 
Cabinet session, an attempt was made to strike the Southern 
Basuhayb Brigade in Dhamar, which is within the northern 
governorates. 
  15. The Cabinet convened in Sanaa from 20-21 April 1994 but 
did not emerge with any resolutions. Its session coincided with 
the following: 
  A. The Southern 3d Brigade, stationed in 'Umran, which is 
within the northern governorates, was hit on 27, 28, 29 April 
1994. 
  B. An attempt was made on the life of Dr. Hasan Makki, the 
first deputy prime minister, on 28 April 1994. 
  C. Previously, the Southern Fifth Brigade, stationed in Hurf 
Sufyan, which is within the northern governorates, was hit on 
26, 27 February 1994. 
  16. Military acts were staged against the Southern Basuhayb 
Brigade, stationed in Dhamar, at the beginning of May 1994. They 
were followed by military acts against the Southern 1st Brigade, 
stationed in Yarim. The brother prime minister contacted the 
brother Presidential Council chairman in the United States, 
where he is being treated, appealing to him to put an end to 
these military operations against the Basuhayb Brigade and the 
1st Brigade. A number of Yemeni figures did the same thing. 
  17. The strikes against these two brigades, in the wake of 
the liquidation of the 3d Brigade and of the president's address 
on 27 April 1994, were tantamount to a declaration of war. 
Consequently, military operations spread to numerous parts of 
the country. 
  18. Since 27 April, Yemen has been witnessing a dangerous 
war 
between forces of the two former states, which have not been 
merged since the country's unification. Moreover, numerous other 
institutions have not been unified due to the aforementioned 
reasons. 
  In accordance with the above, we would like to register our 
profound thanks to the esteemed Security Council and to his 
excellency the secretary general for their interest in the 
conditions in Yemen and for the issuance of Resolution 924. We 
reiterate our adherence to all the provisions of this resolution 
as of 1 June [1994]. 
  In light of our talks with His Excellency Envoy Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, we summarize our viewpoint in the following: 
  A. Ceasefire Observation Mechanism: 
  Reaffirmation of Aden's and Sanaa's actual observation of 
the 
ceasefire, whose repeated violation by the al-Ahmar clan 
government in Sanaa has been confirmed, should take top priority 
in order to stem further deterioration of the conditions. 
  In this regard, the DRY Government reaffirms that it 
welcomes 
Sanaa's declaration and announces its proposal, which it has 
conveyed to the Security Council through UN Envoy Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, that a military observation team supervise the 
ceasefire. Because the previous military committee was formed 
prior to the outbreak of the all-out war and because the U.S. 
military attache, the Russian military attache, and the French 
military attache, as the EC representative, plus brothers from 
the Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, participated in that 
committee, in addition to Northern and Southern military 
elements, then urgent steps must be taken accordingly to 
organize the ceasefire observation mission through a full team 
that is capable of managing and performing the mission in the 
best manner possible. 
  In view of the serious current situation and to establish 
peace in northern and southern Yemen, it is logical and 
appropriate that the observation team should include African, 
Asian, and Arab League representatives so we can ensure a 
complete and prompt implementation of Resolution 924. Afterward, 
consultations can be held on the steps necessary to launch a 
dialogue between the parties concerned without prior conditions 
or reservations. 
  B. Aid: 
  The DRY Government also reaffirms the importance of 
addressing urgent attention to the humanitarian side, 
considering that environmental conditions in the governorates of 
Lahij, Abyan, and Aden have worsened. Ships and planes belonging 
to the International Red Cross, the Islamic Red Crescent, and 
Doctors Without Borders loaded with medicines and foodstuffs, as 
well as rescue teams, stand idle while waiting for their 
shipments to be unloaded at the Aden Port and Airport--which 
were still being subjected to concerted air raids and missile 
and field artillery shelling by hostile Northern forces while 
this statement was being written. This impedes the delivery of 
humanitarian aid to deserving Yemeni citizens in the southern 
governorates. 
  C. Arrangements for consultations with the secretary general 
to hold an emergency Security Council session: 
  While expressing its denunciation and its extreme resentment 
of the method employed by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who has rebelled 
against constitutional legitimacy, who has been hostile to peace 
initiatives, and who has rebelled against the international 
community's will, which is embodied in Security Council 
Resolution 924, the DRY Government finds itself required, by 
virtue of its responsibilities, to seek the convocation of an 
emergency Security Council session to adopt a deterrent measure 
against the Sanaa regime. 
  The DRY Government takes this opportunity to express its 
high 
appreciation for His Excellency Lakhdar Ibrahimi and to register 
its extreme respect for his excellence the secretary general. 
al-Mukalla, 12 June 1994. 
<H5>  Two, text of the UN observers team plan: </H5>

  B. Observers team: It shall consist of 100-150 officers. The 
number may be doubled if the need arises. This team shall be 
selected from the following countries: 
  1. The countries represented in the supervision committee. 
  2. Egypt, Syria, Morocco, and Algeria--Arab bloc. 
  3. Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and India--Asian bloc. 
  4. Senegal, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Kenya--African bloc. 
  Second, the team shall operate under the UN banner and 
within 
the framework of Resolution No. 924. 
  Third, tasks of the ceasefire observers shall be defined in: 
  1. Strengthening the ceasefire and determining the source of 
its violation. 
  2. Supervising separation of the [warring] forces and 
ensuring their withdrawal. 
  Fourth, arrangement for safe aid operations: All facilities 
shall be secured for UN, International Red Cross, and Red 
Crescent aid operations and operations of all organizations 
involved in humanitarian activities. 
  Fifth, the UN secretary general shall take all the measures 
necessary to ensure success of the ceasefire observation team's 
mission. 
<H5>  Three, text of the DRY Foreign Ministry message to the </H5>
permanent Security Council members: 
  The Democratic Republic of Yemen; 
  The deputy prime minister and foreign minister: 
  The DRY Foreign Ministry conveys its warmest greetings to 
the 
foreign ministry of the friendly.... [sentence as published] And 
the foreign ministry wishes to point out continuation of the war 
declared by a backward tribal military band in Sanaa. This band 
is spreading terror among Yemeni citizens in the southern 
governorates, and it no longer possesses any constitutional 
legitimacy. 
  Populated cities in the governorates of Lahij, Aden, 
Shabwah, 
Abyan, and Hadhramawt have been subjected to indiscriminate 
shelling with missiles and cluster bombs and to repeated air 
raids against civilian targets. 
  You are aware that the DRY Government has made sincere 
efforts to reach arrangements for a ceasefire in accordance with 
Security Council Resolution No. 924. But the tribal military 
gang in Sanaa has persisted in its indiscriminate and concerted 
attacks, thus disregarding the resolution. 
  Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's envoy, has 
visited northern and southern Yemen and has talked to the 
parties concerned in an attempt to consolidate the ceasefire 
stipulated by the resolution and to make arrangements for 
peaceful negotiations between the parties concerned under UN 
auspices, either in New York or Geneva or in Cairo, the Arab 
League headquarters. 
  Because the ceasefire arrangements have collapsed repeatedly 
as a result of Sanaa's failure to adhere to the ceasefire--a 
failure confirmed by neutral figures and organizations (AFP, 
Doctors Without Borders)--the DRY Government, while thanking 
your esteemed government for your interest in establishing peace 
between North and South Yemen so the two sides can devote their 
efforts to reconstruction and development, urges your friendly 
government to cooperate in approving the delegation of a 
UN-supervised ceasefire team selected from Arab, African, and 
Asian countries, including Algeria, Mali, Senegal, Malaysia, 
Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt, and Syria. Through 
regional cooperation, the financial aspect concerning the 
observation team will be secured without saddling the United 
Nations with its burdens. 
  Establishing peace in Yemen will rely on your good 
understanding of dimensions of the problem of continued war in 
Yemen and of the ordeals and tragedies it will bring the Yemeni 
people in the North and the South. 
  The UN charter guarantees peoples of the world their right 
to 
self- determination. We were, as you are aware, an independent 
and sovereign state that was tied to your country by firm 
friendly relations. 
  The DRY Foreign Ministry takes this opportunity to express 
to 
your esteemed ministry its thanks, appreciation, and best wishes.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister 
Aden, 14 June 1994.

  [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Washington--It is a measure of 
the changing mood of the U.S. Congress that an anti-India move 
aimed at cutting development assistance to India was defeated 
unanimously in the Rules Committee of the House of 
Representatives on Wednesday. 
  U.S. development assistance and aid under the International 
Military Education and Training (IMET) is meagre -- slightly 
over half a billion dollars a year. For the past three years in 
a row, however, amendments to cut this aid have been routinely 
discussed in the house and used by India-baiters to make 
outlandish charges of human rights violations in Punjab and 
Kashmir. At the forefront of such moves have been India's 
bete noir representative Dan Burton of Indiana and 
some California Congressmen. 
  Last year, representatives Dan Burton and Vic Fazio of 
California managed to embarrass India when a similar amendment 
to censure it on human rights violations was barely defeated 
(231 to 202 votes) in the House. 
  This year too Rep. Dan Burton was flogging his usual 
legislative agenda. He moved two amendments to the 
Appropriations Bill. Had even one of them been admitted, there 
would have been an embarrassing debate in the House on India's 
human rights record. Embarrassing, because representative Dan 
Burton is given to making outlandish charges. For the past three 
years, he has been showing old, grisly photographs of some 
militants killed in Punjab, creating the impression that they 
were recent. A day before Prime Minister Rao addressed the U.S. 
Congress, he claimed in the House that "right now in 
North-Western India in a place called Punjab and in a place 
called Kashmir, 1.1 million Indian troops are gang-raping 
women." The Congressional response to the Indian Prime 
Minister's address to a joint session was positive. Rao's visit 
to the United States and his meeting with President Clinton also 
created the impression that the two nations were serious about 
improving their ties. 
  There is also the fact that U.S. Congressmen are getting 
better informed about India, especially its economic reforms. 
This is the direct result of lobbying by members of the India 
Caucus led by Congressman Jim McDermott, by the lobbyist hired 
by India as well as by the big U.S. Corporations in the India 
Interest Group. Congressmen almost always listen to the voice of 
American business.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Towards Better Ties"] </F>
  [Text] With a tangible shift beginning to become 
discernible in Indo-US relations, it is time the two countries 
took it as a starting point to iron out differences that had 
soured mutual relations in the past. The immediate manifestation 
of the face-off was the US action in letting more than a year go 
by without sending an envoy to New Delhi. To many in India this 
appeared to be a deliberate downgrading of the world's largest 
democracy to second class status. Then there were other issues 
where US took an uncompromising stand. The combined effect was 
the strengthening of the belief that the South Asia policy of 
the US tended to tilt in favour of Pakistan vis-a-vis India. The 
latest thaw, as seen in the changed nuance of the US policy on 
Kashmir, both in tone and content, is a welcome development from 
the Indian point of view. Apart from this, there are indications 
of serious efforts on the part of White House to put relations 
with India on a sound footing. This is evident from the move to 
send a scholar and expert on India, possibly Ainsley T. Embree 
-- known for his vast knowledge of India, its history and 
culture -- as special adviser to ambassador-designate Frank 
Wisner. Embree is expected to help the US Administration 
understand the compulsions and constraints that shape Indian 
policies. 
  While the sensitivity being shown by the Clinton 
Administration needs to be appreciated, it is also necessary for 
India to resist any arm-twisting tactic on the part of the super 
power when it comes to nuclear non-proliferation and other 
issues. At one stage there were fears that the US would settle 
for nothing short of an unconditional surrender on the question 
of NPT (Non-proliferation Treaty). That stage is now over and 
the US has begun to show a better awareness of the reasons for 
India's reservations. The latest US moves point to an implied 
respect for India and its democratic institutions. This can be 
treated as the tangible fruit of the end of cold war in Indo-US 
relations. Other prickly problems should not be beyond 
resolution once the two sides hold meaningful dialogues.

<F P=106> [Article by Bharat Bhushan: "Security Concerns Not </F>
Negotiable, Says Official; `India Has Not Agreed to Multilateral 
Talks'"] 
  [Text] Washington DC -- India's security concerns were not 
negotiable in any multilateral fora and therefore the United 
States proposal for multilateral talks concerning Indian 
security and nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia was a 
non-starter, according to a senior Indian official accompanying 
the Indian Prime Minister during his visit to the United States. 
  The official asserted that no one was more aware than India 
of its own regional security concerns and claimed that India had 
never agreed to discuss them in any multilateral talks. 
  This clear enunciation of the Indian position came on the 
eve 
of the Prime Minister's arrival in the U.S. capital. The Clinton 
administration, however, believes that both India and Pakistan 
have in principle agreed to multilateral talks on 
non-proliferation, arms control and regional security and has 
said so in its latest report to the U.S. Congress. However, it 
admitted that some important differences remain on the issue. 
  The Indian official suggested that it was jumping the gun to 
talk of details such as the number of countries that should 
participate in the multilateral talks or about whether the 
direction of the talks was global or regional. He claimed that 
India had not even agreed to the concept of the multilateral 
talks. 
  The official was asked whether India had not created the 
impressions in the three bilateral rounds of talks with the 
United States that it was agreeable to multilateral talks on 
non-proliferation. He replied that if such an impression had 
been created, and he was not sure whether this need had been the 
case, then it was erroneous. He suggested that it was not 
India's position to opt for a regional non-proliferation 
solution. 
  The official admitted that the issues of non-proliferation, 
arms control and regional security that the United States was 
raising came together in the case of Jammu and Kashmir. However, 
he dismissed out of hand the U.S. assessment that Kashmir could 
be a flashpoint for nuclear war between India and Pakistan. 
  The official said that it was not entirely correct to 
suggest 
that India had problems with the United States only vis-a-vis 
the political relationship between the two countries. On the 
economic side too there were some critical issues to be 
discussed, he said. If the United States wanted access to the 
India market, so did India want access to U.S. market and there 
were problems of access involved in that. 
  Issues relating to intellectual property rights, the use of 
Special 301 provision of the U.S. trade law, the question of 
high technology exports and the movement of Indian software 
personnel remained some thorny issues that needed to be sorted 
out, he said. 
  The official was mapping the broad range of political and 
economic issues that would come up in discussions between Prime 
Minister Narasimha Rao and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The 
State Department spokesman in his regular briefing on Monday 
reiterated the U.S. expectation that the non-proliferation issue 
would certainly be discussed by the two leaders. "The President 
certainly expects to have a discussion that would cover a full 
range of subjects with the Prime Minister and those which 
include our shared concerns of a global nature, it would include 
issues about non-proliferation and regional security issues that 
we raise and discuss with the government of India and others on 
a regular basis." 
  Meetings preparatory to the one between Rao and Clinton have 
been going on between Indian and U.S. officials. Last Friday, 
Indian Ambassador Siddartha Shankar Ray met Deputy Secretary of 
State Strobe Talbott in what was described as "an 
organisational, technical meeting." 
  Asked about the significance of the meeting with Lynn Davis, 
an Indian official said that she had sought the meeting with the 
Foreign Secretary but that nothing special was expected to be 
discussed with her. The meeting it was suggested would be more 
in the nature of her getting to know the Indian Foreign 
Secretary whom she has not met as yet.

  [Text] The Government has been quick to respond to the 
message of the embarrassing non(Euro)-issue of VSNL [expansion 
not given]: the market will hammer a bargain if equity-related 
offerings bunch to add up to a mega draft on investible funds. 
But for the saturation of the `India portfolio' abroad by 
numerous GDR flotations, VSNL would not perhaps have cut a sorry 
figure. So, after abolishing capital issues control at home, the 
Government has decided to regulate the rush of issues flooding 
the Euromarket in search of cheap funds. From now on, a company 
based in India can tap the Euromarket once in 12 months; not 
more than two Euro issues will be permitted to groups during 
this interval; and permission to tap the Euromarket will have to 
be used up within the stipulated quarter. Such grooming 
obviously clears the way for VSNL's re-entry into the 
Euromarket. However, it would be churlish to decry the entry 
regulations as interventionism, unbecoming of a regime that has 
donned the mantle of liberalisation. Sequencing Euroissues is 
essential for decent realisations. 
  Though no formal cap has been placed, the size of Euroissues 
is now related to the end-uses of funds raised abroad. Besides 
capital goods imports and approved investments abroad -- both 
need funding in foreign exchange -- Eurofunds can be used to 
purchase domestic plant and equipment as also buildings. Foreign 
sourcing of funds will thus not pre-empt domestic suppliers. If 
the latter are given deemed export treatment, domestic sourcing 
of plant and equipment with low-cost funds from abroad will get 
a fillip. Another permitted end-use is repayment of foreign 
borrowings, either before the due date or on schedule. This is 
eminently sensible as it facilitates the replacement of high 
cost borrowings with alien risk capital. 
  The new policy provides an escape from high domestic 
interest 
rates. It will help to reduce, not wholly but significantly, 
dependence on high cost domestic long-term funds (supporting 
investment) with cheap capital from abroad. However, it is the 
public sector enterprises that can freely access the Euromarket 
with equity-related instruments under the privatisation policy 
of reducing government ownership of equity from 100 per cent to 
51 per cent. Most large private sector enterprises, in which the 
equity stake of the Indian controlling interest is generally 
small, are wary of equity passing into foreign hands. This 
problem has been mitigated, but not contained, by the new 
policy. It allows the use of 15 per cent of Euro proceeds for, 
inter alia, corporate restructuring. But there is no way of 
precluding the acquisition of new equity from Euroissues by the 
principals of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) based in 
India. To contain the take-over threat, the Government must 
reduce the ceiling on FII holdings in India from the current 
high of 24 per cent.

<F P=106> [Article by Ashok Mitra: "A Banana Republic Takes Shape; </F>
Where is India Heading?"; all quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] The banana republic connotes a set of ground 
realities. But it also mirrors a certain frame of mind: notions 
are turned upside down, irrationality becomes rationality, 
insult is taken to be accolade. This is the state we, it would 
seem, have finally managed to reach. 
  The American administration chose to downgrade our Prime 
Minister's week-long sojourn to God's Own Country. Unlike on all 
previous occasions, this time it was not reckoned as a State 
visit; our Head of Government was given the treatment reserved 
for minor foreign dignitaries who are entitled to only some 
minimal courtesies. 
<H5>  Propitiation </H5>
  We lumped that, in order to propitiate the US administration 
we chose to suspend, even if, as our Government claims, only 
temporarily -- our missile test firing programme. We also rushed 
through a new telecommunications policy which will gladden the 
heart of US transnational corporations. Our spokesman and our 
media were under instructions to make great play of the fact 
that the Prime Minister was invited to address a joint session 
of the US Congress. 
  Between the Senate and the House of Representatives, the 
Congress consists of 535 members. Of them, not even 40 bothered 
to be present and listen to the Indian Prime Minister's address; 
the empty seats of the chamber, had to be filled by minions from 
the Indian Embassy and their family members and by some of the 
officials from new Delhi who constituted the Prime Minister's 
entourage. 
  Even the press gallery was principally occupied by the 
plane-load of journalists the Prime Minister had taken along 
with him. The visit of the Indian Prime Minister and his 
perorations at New York, Houston, Boston and Washington, D.C. 
were blacked out by the American media. This was not deliberate, 
but matter of course. A banana republic is taken for granted. 
  India was no longer the ogre leading the great non-aligned 
movement. There was no Krishna Menon around to incense, 
Time magazine by his forked tongue, and this puny 
visitor from a diminished country was no Jawaharlal Nehru or 
Indira Gandhi. 
  At the joint press conference following his session in the 
Oval Room with the US President, our Prime Minister was cut to 
size; he was simply ignored by the media. Only one American 
journalist chose to ask him a question; that was on the human 
rights situation in Kashmir, and the answer he gave was received 
with unconcealed disbelief. 
  The rest of the time, the Prime Minister of the world's 
largest democracy was a mute onlooker, even as correspondent 
after correspondent kept targeting a barrage of questions at the 
US President, not on US-Indian relations, but on his domestic 
health programme, on Haiti, on China's MFN (Most Favoured 
Nation) status, on the domestic interest rate structure, and so 
on. 
  But Clinton spoke a few polite words about our country; 
these 
were obligatory for the occasion. He was, however, in no 
generous mood; he left none in doubt that the American 
administration would continue to harass New Delhi on the issues 
of nuclear non-proliferation, regional disarmament, Kashmir and 
human rights; there was going to be no switching off of the heat 
following the visit. 
  His promise to send two special emissaries -- the Secretary 
of Commerce and the Energy Secretary -- in the course of the 
year is not bereft of significance either; one Secretary will 
press India to allow further market access to US goods and 
services; the other one is to ensure that the Indian authorities 
do not renege at the last moment their pledge to buy dozens and 
dozens of obsolete power plants from the United States and 
additionally guarantee American investors a minimum rate of 
return of 16 per cent. 
  This is precisely where the state of the mind becomes 
relevant. All sensitivities are spent. The banana republic does 
not even realise that it is at the receiving end of the banana 
republic treatment. Every insult is regarded as a benediction. 
<H5>  A Dream World </H5>
  The Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy misses 
the import of the adage that dignity is as dignity does; as he 
emerges from his tete-a-tete with the US President, he 
gloatingly informs the world press that, look, there has been no 
twisting of his arm. No Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi could 
have imagined that an Indian Prime Minister was capable of 
sinking to such a grovelling level. 
  But a banana republic has its own code. It lives in its own 
illusory world. The block of press people who accompanied the 
Prime Minister would, for the next month and thereabouts, write 
dutiful columns on what a thundering success the Prime 
Minister's American safari was, on the umpteen points he 
succeeded in scoring off Pakistan, on how well his speeches went 
down with the US audiences, on how American industrialists and 
businessmen were totally bowled over when our Prime Minister 
described to them the limitless possibilities of the market 
India offered, on how our Prime Minister's quote from Abraham 
Lincoln completely befuddled a nondescript US State Department 
official named Raphel. 
  Such is the banana republic state of the mind or, if one 
were 
to use that state-of-the-art expression, mind-set. A banana 
republic assumes itself to be the centre of the universe. The 
reality is that it is nobody. It gets accustomed to the role of 
a vassal State, but imagines the serfdom to be sovereignty. Its 
press becomes excruciatingly conformist. We are currently 
witnessing the unfolding of this phenomenon. 
<H5>  Act of Accommodation </H5>
  Our Government, if we have to go by our media, can do no 
wrong, and the Americans, thanks to the Prime Minister's visit, 
have shed all their reservations about our country; even on 
Kashmir and the nuclear business, the Americans, it will be 
asserted, have been most understanding. A surrender to foreign 
pressure, don't you know, is not really surrender, but an act of 
accommodation. The lingo itself undergoes a transformation. We 
no longer talk of a suspension of our missile development 
programme, we merely `cap' it. 
  The banana republic has arrived, and it has brought along 
with it a new manual of manners and norms. The poor have dropped 
out of the nation's conscience. The nation itself is now defined 
in terms of the foibles and predilections of the top 10 or 15 
per cent of the social stratum. The latter dream American and 
think America. Their priorities determine official policy. 
Thanks to the spate of economic reforms since 1991; this upper 
crust had never had it so good; the consumerist arcadia they 
have attained has, therefore, to be protected at all cost. 
  The high living of the upper classes has been made possible 
by interminable borrowings from foreign parties; such borrowings 
have been contingent upon letting go, in substantial measure, 
bits and pieces of the nation's economic sovereignty. The 
surrender of economic prerogatives cannot but endanger political 
sovereignty as well, as we are increasingly likely to learn in 
the course of the next few months; President Clinton has 
promised as much. But the upper crust mind-set is not disturbed. 
  This mind-set expresses itself only in cliches: 
globalisation 
is good; we must integrate with the world; the market must be 
free; there is no substitute for efficiency; privatisation 
promotes efficiency. 
  What good globalisation has till now done to the country is 
a 
query this mind-set feels no need to respond to; the fact that 
such data as are available suggest that efficiency in the Indian 
public sector units as a whole, measured by the rate of return, 
has in recent years been much higher than in the private sector 
does not impress them. Nor do they like to be detained by such 
abstractions as loss of national sovereignty. 
  Since they never had it so good, why should they worry 
whether their country has been reduced to the state of a banana 
republic and, anyway, what is wrong with being a banana republic? 
  The Prime Minister and his entourage perhaps know better. 
But 
they have their private concerns. The model they have opted for, 
they know, is unsustainable without a continuous, and rising 
inflow of foreign funds. In past decades, such funds were 
arranged on a government-to-government basis, with some 
master-of ceremonies role on the part of the World Bank. The 
cessation of the Cold War has ended the chapter of 
government-to-government munificence. Private capital inflows 
now offer the only possibility of escape. 
  The wretched foreigners are, however, not coming in droves, 
and they are not investing in growth. American business and 
industry are playing hard. India is an eleventh-rate country 
which does not hold their interest. They will come only if their 
charter of demands is fully granted, and perhaps not even then. 
There is no evidence that the Americans ever helped any banana 
republic to develop into an economically strong nation. It is 
the fate of a banana republic to continue to be a dependent 
territory. 
<H5>  The Suffering Many </H5>
  The upper crust will not mind that state of being, but will 
they be able to hold down the nation's overwhelming majority who 
will get nothing; absolutely nothing, out of the emerging social 
end economic arrangements? The Prime Minister may keep visiting 
the United States oftener, US officials may increase the 
frequency of their visits to our shores, the answer to the 
riddle however lies within the country itself.

<F P=106> [Article by Basheer Hussain: "GATT Accord and the Indian </F>
Constitution; No Real Role for Parliament"] 
  [Text] The Opposition parties have been demanding that the 
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) accord should be 
ratified by the Parliament. Union Commerce Minister Pranab 
Mukherjee, addressing a meeting of the Congressmen at 
Bhubaneswar on April 24, said: "The Union Council of Ministers 
is fully empowered to take a decision under the Indian 
Constitution where Parliament has no role." 
  He further said: "Scores of treaties and agreements had been 
signed by India in the past after being approved by the Council 
of Ministers and no one has ever raised the question as to why 
it was not debated in Parliament," and added "Articles 73(b) and 
253 fully empower the Cabinet to take such decisions." 
<H5>  Provisions </H5>
  In view of this controversy, it is pertinent to examine the 
relevant provisions of the Constitution. The following are the 
provisions relating to conclusion and enforcement of treaties in 
the Indian Constitution: Articles 51(c), 73(b), 253 and Entry 14 
of List I in the Seventh Schedule. 
  Art. 51(c) is the Directive Principle of State Policy and it 
urges the State to endeavour to foster respect for international 
law and treaty obligations. Art. 73(b) states that the executive 
power of the Indian Union is exercisable without prior 
legislation to enforce the provisions of a treaty provided it 
does not conflict with the provisions of the Constitution. Art. 
253 gives power to Parliament to make laws even encroaching upon 
the State subjects enumerated in the State List II of the 
Seventh Schedule for implementing a treaty. 
  In other words, what Parliament by itself cannot do, it can 
do, aided by a treaty. Finally Entry 14 of the List I of the 
Seventh Schedule confers on the Union Government exclusive power 
to conclude treaties with foreign countries. 
  To understand the implications of the constitutional 
provisions relating to treaty, one has to know the British 
Common Law practice and the attitude of the Indian judiciary. 
British Common Law is in force in India by virtue of Art. 272. 
For instance, the personal laws of Muslims and Hindus, and the 
Law of Torts are part of British Common Law. 
  According to Common Law practice it is the royal prerogative 
to make a treaty. But if the treaty were to alter the internal 
law either by conferring rights on individuals or depriving 
individuals of their rights which they enjoy under the domestic 
law, that treaty requires legislation by parliament. It is known 
as enabling act. It means unless Parliament by appropriate 
legislation incorporates the provisions of a treaty into its 
domestic law (Municipal Law) it does not become part of English 
Law. 
<H5>  Executive Act </H5>
  The reason why the enabling act of Parliament is required to 
enforce a treaty internally is, that the conclusion of a treaty 
is an executive act. Neither Houses of Parliament participate in 
the treaty-making process. If the treaty were to be enforced 
internally without the enabling act of Parliament, it amounts to 
the executive being empowered to legislate. This may be 
dangerous. The British practice is that the enabling act is 
passed by parliament before the treaty is ratified. 
  There is also a practice called the Ponsonby Rule. Under 
this 
Rule, a treaty is laid before Parliament 21 days prior to 
ratification and publication in the United Kingdom Treaty 
Series. However this is not a legal requirement. 
<H5>  In America </H5>
  Under the United States Constitution, the President has the 
"Power by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make 
treaties provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur" 
(Art. 6). 
  As the US Senate, one of the houses of the legislature, 
participates in the treaty-making process, "all treaties which 
shall be made under the Authority of the US shall be the supreme 
law of the land" (Art. 6). An enabling act to enforce a treaty 
internally is not required. 
  The courts in India follow the British practice. The 
President of India like the Queen in England is competent to 
make a treaty. If a treaty were to affect the rights of a 
citizen, it has to be supported by legislation. 
  In Maganbhai vs Union of India (1969, SC). The Supreme Court 
said: "If as a consequence of the exercise of executive power, 
the rights of citizens or others are restricted or infringed or 
laws are modified, the exercise must be supported by 
legislation, when there is no such restriction, infringement of 
the right or modification of the laws, the executive is 
competent to exercise power." 
  Besides infringement of rights, legislation is also required 
to give effect to a treaty which provides for payment of money 
to a foreign power which must be drawn from the Consolidated 
Funds of India (Moti Lal vs Uttar Pradesh, 1961 Allahabad High 
Court). 
  However, an amendment to the Constitution is necessary to 
cede Indian territory to a foreign State (re. Berubari Union of 
India, 1960 Supreme Court). 
  But neither an amendment to the Constitution nor legislation 
is necessary for an agreement with a foreign State to refer a 
boundary dispute to an international tribunal or to implement 
the award of the tribunal. Changes in the boundary line can be 
done by executive following the award. Boundary settlements or 
the awards of tribunals should be recognised by the courts of 
our country (Maganbhai vs Union of India). 
  The GATT accord does not, in any way, infringe the legal 
rights of an Indian citizen. If the Government of India had felt 
that GATT would infringe or modify the rights of the citizens it 
would have introduced appropriate legislation in Parliament to 
bring the Indian laws in accordance with the provisions of GATT 
before ratification. 
<H5>  Assumption </H5>
  It should be noted that Article 27 of the Vienna Convention 
on the Law of Treaties stipulates: "A party may not invoke the 
provisions of its internal law as a justification for its 
failure to perform a treaty." A country cannot legislate out of 
international law. The courts while, giving effect to the 
provisions of treaty internally, should presume that it was not 
the intention of the executive or parliament to violate the law 
of the land.

<F P=106> [Article: "ITC Plans To Emerge as Global Player"] </F>
  [Text] Calcutta, May 26 -- ITC [India Tobacco Corporation] 
has re-emphasised its objective to emerge as India's first 
multinational even as it announced a bonus issue of shares after 
reporting a net profit of Rs. [Rupees] 206 crore for 1993-1994. 
  "...Strong Indian companies should go overseas with their 
products and services as India's flag bearers," ITC Chairman 
K.L. Chugh observed while reporting a gross income of Rs. 4,280 
crore in the last fiscal. 
  Explaining his company's corporate strategy in a liberalised 
regime Mr Chugh said: "It has been my firm belief that in order 
to integrate ourselves fast with the global economy, foreign 
investment and technology should be inducted through 
multinationals in areas that are needed." 
  Mr Chugh's observations made after a meeting of the board 
here yesterday are significant because the company recently 
thwarted British American Tobacco (BAT)'s [as published] efforts 
to get a controlling stake and hive off some of ITC's 
non-traditional businesses. 
  It was, however, obvious that Mr Chugh's corporate 
philosophy 
of taking on multinational predators applied only to hostile 
takeover bids. 
  Though the ITC Chairman did not specifically mention the 
Centre for its support during his successful operation to 
stonewall BAT, it was clear that the company perceives a period 
of closer ties with the Union Finance Ministry. 
  ITC's profits before tax increased 34 percent over that of 
1992-93 to Rs. 350 crore (Rs. 261.48 crore). With a market 
capitalisation of Rs. 6,794 crore it continued to be among 
India's blue chips. The company's foreign exchange earnings 
totalled Rs. 822 crore.

  [Text] New Delhi, May 26 (PTI) -- The Government should 
create an Indian common market to propel the growth of the 
economy by removing octroi and other forms of levies which 
hinder the free inter-state movement of goods, according to 
eminent economist, Dr Raja Chelliah. 
  These barriers prevent the establishment of a common market 
as well as hinder faster development, especially the backward 
states, he said. 
  The states must also change the mindset of its political 
leaders and bureaucrats, simplify procedures for approvals and 
inspections if they are to attract investment, essential for 
economic development, Dr Chelliah said at a seminar held here 
recently. 
  He said unless the backward states take steps to tone up 
their administration and end "licence raj" and "inspection raj," 
they are likely to lose more in the race for development. 
  Inaugurating the seminar, organised by the Centre for New 
Perspectives, Mr K.C. Pant, Chairman of the tenth finance 
commission, called for developing a consensus on the issue of 
non-plan expenditure of the Government.

<F P=106> [Article: "A Variety of Splits"; quotation marks as </F>
published] 
  [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Tiruchi--The past one year 
seems to be a year of splits for some major and minor political 
parties in Tamil Nadu and the latest one has occurred in the 
Pattali Makkal Katchi [PMK]. Panrutti S. Ramachandran, who was 
the solitary MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) elected on the 
PMK ticket to the assembly in 1991, has been expelled from the 
party and he launched a new party on Sunday called `Makkal Nala 
Urimai Kazhagam.' 
  (The `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam' is the second political 
party in the state to have the portrait of a person in the 
double colour flag and this party has chosen to have the 
portrait of saint Thiruvalluvar in the flag. The first political 
party, perhaps in the whole country, to have the portrait of a 
person in the flag, was AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam), which had chosen to have the portrait of Anna in the 
flag from 1972, when it split from the DMK (Dravida Munnetra 
Kazhagam). 
  There is a wind of change sweeping the political scene in 
the 
state since October 3 last year. A storm broke out in the DMK in 
Oct 1993 in the wake of the party supremo Karunanidhi's 
allegation based on unconfirmed IB reports that the LTTE 
[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] was plotting against him to 
promote the interests of V. Gopalsamy, MP (Member of 
Parliament). This triggered off a big controversy culminating in 
the split in the party and leading to the formation of a 
separate political party `Marumalarchi DMK' last week in Madras. 
This is the second major split suffered by the DMK since 1972 
when MGR quit and formed his own party. 
  The Marumalarchi DMK is making its electoral debut in 
Mylapore and Perundurai constituencies. 
  The Pattali Makkal Katchi founded by S. Ramdas, a medical 
practitioner, was split into two with the expulsion of Panrutti 
Ramachandran. Panrutti and Nellikkuppam Krishnamurthy, a former 
MLA, have formed the new party `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam.' 
  As a result of the split in the Indian Union Muslim League, 
the Tamil Nadu unit is also split. The TN unit is now led by AKA 
Abdul Samad and the splinter group `Indian National League' by 
M.A. Latheef. Both AKA Abdul Samad and MA Latheef have become 
the all-Indian general secretaries of their respective parties. 
  There is a mushroom growth of regional parties in the state 
and it is difficult to keep count of them. One could have an 
idea of the number of regional parties only when the Doordarshan 
and AIR (All India Radio) broadcast the messages of political 
leaders on the eve of important festivals like Pongal, Tamil New 
Year's Day. 
  A seasoned political leader with three decades' existence in 
public life humorously remarked that he came to know of the 
number of political parties in Tamil Nadu only during the Tamil 
New Year's Day and Pongal when TV and AIR in its news bulletins 
would broadcast the festival messages of leaders of various 
political parties. 
  The Congress in Tamil Nadu is having three factions, one 
headed by Vazhappadi Ramamurthy, TNCC (Tamil Nadu (Indira) 
Congress Committee) (I) chief, G.K. Moopanar, a senior party 
leader and K.V. Thangabalu, Union Minister of State for Welfare.

<F P=106> [Article by P.N. Benjamin: "Foreign Policy in the Nehru </F>
Era"; quotation marks as published] 
  [Text] Today (May 27) the nation observes the 30th 
anniversary of the passing away of Jawaharlal Nehru. Nehru's 
life and work cannot be studied in isolation. It is an integral 
part of the Gandhian era. 
  Gandhi and Nehru guided the destiny of India during the 
turbulent days of the freedom struggle. They represented 
different facets of a giant nation awakening from a long 
slumber. Gandhiji stressed the spiritual nature of man, while 
Nehru emphasised unity within the family of man. 
  Their ideals and endeavours were never in conflict; they 
were 
complementary to each other. From this heritage flow the ideals 
of democracy, socialism and secularism and a foreign policy of 
peace and non-alignment. 
  It is rare in history that there is almost total 
identification between a political figure and a certain policy. 
The idea of non-alignment free from power blocs, as distinct 
from the earlier concept of neutrality or the later pejorative 
phrase `neutralism,' is associated both in its origin and its 
evolution with Jawaharlal Nehru. 
  He anticipated the needs of the newly-independent countries 
of a world dominated by very powerful systems. Because of the 
nature of the Indian national movement and his personal ability 
to articulate embryonic ideas, Nehru was able to champion the 
cause of non-alignment in a most attractive manner. 
  The origins of the Indian policy of non-alignment have been 
faithfully recorded in the speeches of Nehru and the documents 
of the Indian National Congress throughout the Thirties. A study 
of these documents proves how inevitable the policy of 
non-alignment was after India became independent. 
  There was no doubt, from the very beginning, in Nehru's mind 
that the essence of independence lay in the ability of the new 
Indian State to take decisions free from any external influence. 
He realised that while in internationalism economic relations 
have to be built, those relations should not in any way take on 
a character which would condition our political outlook and our 
foreign policy. 
  Nehru was totally opposed to any kind of economic 
co-operation that offended either the dignity or the prospects 
of independence. That was his definition or understanding of 
non-alignment in international affairs. 
  It was not as though he sat one morning and found out a 
phrase. As he said: "Foreign policies grow, they will not come 
out of a box or anything of that kind. Non-alignment, in brief 
words, is simply the expression of national independence in the 
sphere of international relations. An independent country has to 
remain non-aligned. A powerful country seeks allies...., but a 
country like ours which wants to be independent internally. It 
is for us to realise that smaller nations, newer nations, who 
are non-aligned, have also their ideas of independence." 
  Nehru realised and recognised that India had "no particular 
mission in this world, in the sense, of trying to tell other 
people what to do. But at the same time, she had the mission of 
playing an equal, responsible and significant part in the 
destinies of the world as any other; and, on account of our 
size, on account of our importance, to do it as well as 
possible." 
  Nehru was the first statesman of the world to recognise the 
significance of Africa and he was one of those people who 
anticipated that in far shorter time than even optimists dared 
to hope that the great continent of Africa would become free. 
  In 1954, India was the first country to come forward and ask 
for a standstill agreement in regard to the nuclear bomb. Nehru 
knew that the stopping of these tests did not mean much. He knew 
all about its effects not only on his generation but generations 
to come. 
  Long before non-alignment figured in the international 
affairs circuit in the mid-Fifties, India had become visibly 
active in world affairs. The call for an Asian Relations 
Conference a few months before the actual transfer of power was 
daring for a government which was yet to find its feet. 
Nevertheless, it reflected the irrepressible urge of the first 
country to have broken out of the colonial yoke, to play a 
purposeful role in international affairs. 
  More specifically, the government-level conference on 
Indonesia that Nehru called in Delhi in 1949 bears testimony to 
his interest, urge and determination that independent India 
should be active in international affairs. 
  It is not necessary to go into a detailed study of all the 
steps in the evolution of Nehru's foreign policy, but the 
decision to remain in the Commonwealth, the active diplomatic 
initiatives in Korea and Indo-China and championing the cause of 
Egypt during the Suez crisis are memorable milestones. 
Synchronised with these developments, was the continuous process 
of the development of Afro Asian personality which had its roots 
in the Asian Relations Conference and culminated in Bandung in 
1955. 
  The success of Nehru's policy was due to his cool realistic 
reassessment of India's own limited ability to contribute 
effectively to solutions of problems. Inflated rhetoric without 
any serious intention to translate words into reality was 
repugnant to Nehru's mind. 
  An important feature of India's foreign policy during 
Nehru's 
time was that the Government's effort to inform and enlighten 
the people on international issues. 
  In the early period of Indian independence, Nehru impressed 
upon the people that great as India had been in the past and 
hoped to be in the future, we could not exist in isolation as it 
would be good neither for us nor for the rest of the humanity 
without which we could not live.

  [Text] Hyderabad, May 27: Rich tributes were paid to the 
first Premier Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at a colloquium on 
"Relevance of Jawaharlal Nehru's Philosophy in Contemporary 
India" organised by the AP Chapter of the Jawaharlal Nehru 
National Youth Centre (JNNYC), here on Friday. 
  The Minister for Panchayat Raj, Mr D.K. Samarasimha Reddy, 
said had he (Nehru) not laid the foundation for democracy, the 
country would not have seen such a development in spite of 
experiencing turbulent times on many an occasion. He said Pandit 
Nehru, who understood the crux of the Indian polity, thought it 
fit to further cement the democratic set up. "He was 
instrumental in giving a right mix of socialism and capitalism 
to suit the Indian conditions," he observed. 
  Mr Samarasimha Reddy said the former Prime Minister time and 
again used to remind the people to attain self-reliance while 
maintaining cordial relationship with America and Russia. For 
the over all development, Panditji had introduced the Five-Year 
Plan and gave impetus to industrial and agricultural 
development. "To sustain a democracy, Panditji has also framed 
the three-wheel vehicle -- the Legislature, the Executive and 
the Judiciary. If any one of these wheels fails, democracy is 
bound to collapse," he added. 
  The Minister described Nehru as a true democrat, a statesman 
par excellence and a visionary who had ensured the country the 
present status of a developing nation. "He was also a true 
secular," he pointed out. All through his life, Nehru opposed 
import of technology and hence he had laid a strong foundation 
for scientific and research laboratories. "None could forget 
Panditji's contribution to the technological capabilities." He 
said Nehru was the architect of the Non-aligned Movement and the 
father of the `Panch Shell.' 
  The Reserve Bank of India Director, Mr Ch Hanumantha Rao, 
said even Russian economists were attracted to Nehru's policies. 
He said democracy was the only tool for any country's 
development and cited how Communism collapsed in Russia and 
elsewhere in Europe. He said the day was not far when even China 
would get attracted to democracy. 
  Mr Mohit Sen, Chairman, United Communist Party, Dr K. Keshav 
Rao, Chairman of the Rajiv Technology Mission, Ms Nannapaneni 
Rajakumari, Chief Whip, and Mr P. Goverdhan Reddy, JNNYC 
Chairman, also spoke. 
  The Congress MP (Member of Parliament), Mr T. Venkatram 
Reddy, who was to participate in the seminar, could not attend. 
In his speech, which was read out in absentia, Mr Reddy said: 
"Even after three decades had passed since Panditji left us, his 
impact on every aspect of national life continues to be felt. 
Such was his contribution during the freedom struggle and as a 
leader of the nascent free India that he was the unchallenged 
leader and a darling of the masses." 
  He said though Panditji was born with a silver spoon in his 
mouth, his sacrifices and self-denial were supreme. Panditji was 
instrumental in India's modernisation process and introducing a 
scientific temper in order to eradicate poverty and fighting 
superstition, orthodoxy and such customs and practices that came 
in the way of progress and development. 
  He said no historian dared to forget Nehru's contribution as 
a world leader, as a man of the masses and as a human being 
without whom India would not have been committed to the ideals 
of secularism, socialism and planning.

  [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE New Delhi -- The 
Government is hoping to tighten the enforcement of copyright 
laws against pirated video films and audio cassettes through new 
training programmes to educate police and customs officials 
about the intricacies of intellectual property rights. 
  Come November, a series of seminars will be held in Delhi in 
collaboration with the World Intellectual Property Organisation 
in Geneva for senior levels of the police and customs 
departments. 
  These seminars will shift later to the states for the 
benefit 
of junior officials. 
  The Centre is also planning to request the states to set up 
a 
Copyright Enforcement Cell which will oversee the enforcement of 
the copyright laws. 
  Briefing mediapersons on the amended Copyright Law passed by 
Parliament last week, Additional Secretary in the Education 
Department, Y.N. Chaturvedi admitted that the Law was a 
"brain-twister." Its implementation was faulty, he said, mainly 
because the police, which is the enforcing agency, did not have 
a basic knowledge of its provisions. 
  Regarding the recent Amendment, Chaturvedi said it would 
have 
"far reaching effects" in protecting the intellectual property 
rights of creative artists, particularly the poorer and more 
vulnerable ones. 
  One of the important changes introduced by the Amendment is 
redefining what constitutes a copyrighted musical work. The 
Amendment moves away from the traditional British definition 
that musical compositions had to be written or notated to 
warrant copyright protection. 
  "Since much of Indian music is not in the form of graphic 
notations, the identity of a musical composition will now be 
through its author," Chaturvedi said. 
  In addition, the Amendment for the first time gives rights 
to 
performers such as snake charmers, acrobats, conjurers, actors 
and singers, making it mandatory for anybody to seek their 
permission for a video or audio recording. 
  Computer programmes, cinematography films and sound 
recordings have also been brought under the purview of the Act.

said: Natural resources are endangered in the province of 
Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad due to utilization without regard to 
technical and scientific principles. 
  Engineer Nehavandi said: The amount of livestock in this 
province exceeds the capacity of the pastures and the fuel for 
70 percent of the rural people is procured from the wood of 
forest trees. 
  He added: In addition to this, the conversion of pastures 
for 
low-yield dry farming and improper plowing on slopes has 
destroyed the plant cover and the good fodder. With the 
destruction of the pastures and forests, the soil in this 
province is eroding rapidly. 
  Among the damaging effects of the destruction of natural 
resources in this province, he cited the harmful floods of the 
last few years in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad and the excessive 
rural emigration to the cities. 
  Of the 16,000 square kilometers of total area in the 
province 
of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad, 230,000 hectares is agricultural 
lands and the rest is forest and pasture.

  [Text] Events Service -- The second executive meeting of 
judicial officials involved in the antinarcotics campaign and 
the Greater Tehran Police was held to study procedures for 
conducting the antinarcotics campaign. It was held at the 
Greater Tehran Police Precinct Central Staff Office and was 
attended by Hojjat ol-Eslam Moqasiyeh, supervisor of the 
Antinarcotics Public Prosecutor's Office, Commander Abol-Fathi, 
commander of the Greater Tehran Police Precinct, and the deputy 
and assistant antinarcotics prosecutors. 
  This coordinating meeting was attended by Commander 
Brigadier-General Seyyed Mojtaba, consultant to the police 
commander in chief, Commander Shafi'i, the general manager of 
the police antinarcotics campaign, the deputy commander of the 
precinct office of Political Ideology, regional commanders, 
Taybasi, the governor-general of Tehran's representative, the 
chiefs of the Tehran antinarcotics campaign offices, and the 
deputy commanders. First the measures enacted at the first 
meeting were discussed and studied. 
  As the meeting continued, the one and one-half month 
performance of the Tehran Antinarcotics Campaign Office was 
given, including the arrest of 2,669 addicts and 450 smugglers 
with previous records, the destruction of 26 narcotics 
procurement and distribution gangs, and the seizure of 871 kg of 
various types of narcotics. 
  In a speech, Commander Abol-Fathi, commander of the Greater 
Tehran Police Precinct, called for harsher punishments for 
narcotics smugglers. He said: The Greater Tehran Police Force is 
prepared to work as actively as possible, to increase its strike 
force, and is ready as necessary for a decisive and serious 
campaign against narcotics smugglers. 
  Hojjat ol-Eslam Moqasiyeh, supervisor of the Antinarcotics 
Public Prosecutor's Office, gave a speech in which he said in 
this regard: Last year was a year in which much work was done at 
the public prosecutor's office and by the police, and everywhere 
there were more narcotics seizures, more arrests of addicts and 
smugglers, and more narcotics procurement and distribution gangs 
were destroyed. New changes also began in this regard. The 
increased seizure statistics in the country show the greater 
efficiency and activity of antinarcotics agents, while in some 
countries where there are more addicts, smugglers and narcotics, 
the statistics on seizures and arrests are much lower. 
  He added: In the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] 
19,713 cases were filed and investigated, and 71.6 metric tons 
of seized narcotics in the country were delivered to factories 
for conversion in the pharmaceutical industries. 
  He also added: In view of the fact that the antinarcotics 
campaign is a sacred struggle, sacred procedures, methods, and 
individuals must also be employed in this regard, and sound 
individuals must be used.

<F P=106> [Article by Kaleem Akhtar: "U.S. Wants To Make India </F>
Regional Policeman To Protect Its Interests"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that the United States showed 
enough interest in the "Kashmir freedom struggle" to call it a 
live issue that needed resolution. President Clinton also 
mentioned the movement in Kashmir. This was the first time in 
many years that a U.S. president had recognized this fact. The 
Indian media's hue and cry over this was natural. Since the 
freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir changed into an armed 
confrontation; Kashmiri workers, journalists, and politicians 
started having contacts with the outside world; Kashmir centers 
were established in the United States, England, Canada, and 
Saudi Arabia; and many "NGOs" [nongovernmental organizations] 
have become active, the Kashmir issue has become prevalent all 
over again. In this context, we cannot ignore Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto's hard work. She bravely and astutely presented 
the Kashmir issue at all international forums and during her 
foreign travels. The fact that Pakistan could not present its 
resolution effectively in Geneva does not mean that Pakistan has 
adopted flexibility in its fundamental stand or the freedom 
struggle of Kashmiri people has weakened. Therefore, it is 
appropriate to say that Pakistan is still firm on its stand and 
the Kashmiri people are still active in the battle field. 
  This whole exercise, which also includes India's "exercise 
in 
atrocities," has helped the whole world to at least understand 
that Jammu and Kashmir are not an "integral part" of India; that 
this is a disputed region about which the UN Security Council 
has passed resolutions. The Kashmiris are fighting against 
India's invasion and control and India is using military power 
to stop them and is violating human rights there. 
  As for the United States, the Kashmiris living there have 
convinced the U.S. politicians, intellectuals, and journalists 
that India is committing bestial actions in occupied Kashmir. 
That is why the U.S. press, which used to publish one-sided news 
to do its duty to support India in the past, is also publishing 
some real facts. Pakistani and Kashmiri representatives have 
also succeeded in establishing their lobbies in the United 
States. Although the pro-India factions had worked hard for the 
last four and a half years to have Pakistan declared a 
"terrorist" or a "fundamentalist" nation, they were unsuccessful 
and the U.S. government has agreed that Pakistan is not involved 
in any kind of terrorism. 
  Thus, the pro-India group in the United States including 
famous author Selig Harrison has been forced to admit that the 
present movement in occupied Kashmir is purely a people's 
movement against Indian occupation of Kashmir. The fact is that 
India has a major lobby in the United States supported by Jews. 
These people repeat the story that India feeds them. This Jewish 
group includes Stephen Solarz, William Shuazberg, James Claude, 
and Selig Harrison. Their job is to sing India's song all the 
time. The reason for this is their enmity towards Islam. If 
these American intellectuals see any danger after the fall of 
communism, then it is Islam. They are also afraid of China in 
Asia. Anyhow, what I am trying to say is that the efforts of 
Pakistanis and Kashmiris have stopped the progress of the Indian 
lobby and it was the result of their efforts that a group in the 
United States has emerged now that discusses Kashmir. Some of 
these condemn human rights violations, others mention other 
options for solving this dispute, and still others offer ways to 
conciliate. 
  We cannot forget Assistant Secretary for South Asian Affairs 
Robin Raphel's role in this context. She issued several 
statements about the Kashmir campaign during the last few months 
and openly supported the idea that India should resolve this 
issue fully and make the UN Security Council and Shimla 
Agreement the basis of these efforts. India reacted to it 
strongly and the Indian government complained to the Unites 
States to take notice of Ms. Robin Raphel's statements. It is 
important to mention the fact that Assistant Secretary Robin 
Raphel went to India uninvited recently and explained her 
statements related to Kashmir. She emphasized that she had never 
challenged the idea of Kashmir joining India, and had only said 
that Kashmir is a disputed issue and should be resolved, and 
this is possible under the Shimla Agreement. 
  Now who will ask Ms. Robin Raphel who will push India in 
this 
direction? India never started talks according to the Shimla 
Agreement. It has been repeatedly saying that Jammu and Kashmir 
are India's "integral part" and if there is a problem, then it 
is: when will the Line of Control accepted as a permanent 
border. The problem is that a faction in the United States, 
which is associated with the government, accepts the influence 
of India's propaganda and wants to sing the song of making the 
Line of Control the permanent border. Recently, a U.S. 
professor, Tom Travis, said in Peshawar that the Line of Control 
should be accepted as an international border. Meanwhile, U.S. 
Senator Dan Burton believes that the present Kashmiri campaign 
is a bona fide campaign and can be compared to the U.S. War of 
Independence. According to him, India should recognize Kashmiri 
people's right to self-determination. Both these points are 
being discussed in the United States now and the Kashmiri people 
have made it clear as day with their unprecedented and 
innumerable sacrifices that Jammu and Kashmir are not, and never 
will be, "integral parts" of India. However, during the last few 
days, especially after Mr. Talbott's return from Pakistan, the 
United States has become quiet about the Kashmir issue. His 
visit to Pakistan was declared to be successful, however, on 
what basis this trip called successful has not been known to us 
yet. One thing is clear; there was no mention of Kashmir in the 
joint communique. The truth is that the United States has 
economic relations with India and it is investing in Indian 
projects. Ms. Robin Raphel said in her clarification that the 
United States is the largest investor in India and that both 
nations want to encourage peace and human rights. The United 
States and India have the same viewpoint. Late Maulana Zaffar 
Ali Khan had said once, [couplet] "A drunkard who tells the 
truth in his drunken state is a lot better person than a 
religious person." The same can be said about Robin Raphel. We 
have been crying from the beginning that India and the United 
States are both together because the anti-Islamic attitude of 
the United States and India is not a secret to any one. The 
living example of this is the establishment of Israel and now 
India and Israel are together and the Israeli commandos are 
working side-by-side with Indian soldiers to crush the freedom 
fighters in Kashmir. This is the lobby that India created in the 
United States. Thus, the United States which claims to be a 
champion of peace and humanity all over the world, adopts double 
standards when it comes to dealing with Muslims. It throws its 
own principles out the window and puts pressure on Pakistan, 
some time back having asked it to roll back its nuclear program. 
Other times it has harassed Pakistan by accusing it of 
fundamentalism and terrorism. Now it is asking us to "freeze" 
Kashmir. This is done mostly because Pakistan is considered weak 
and conspiracies are afoot to isolate it in the world. All this 
is done because, as Ilama Iqbal said, [couplet] "The lord of 
fate had ordered from the beginning that punishment for the 
crime of being weak is sudden death." The fact is that after 
Talbott's visit to Pakistan, our relations with the United 
States have neither cooled nor warmed up. The United States 
wants Pakistan to roll back its nuclear program, however, 
Pakistan is neither willing to do so now nor will it ever agree 
to it. Pakistan's security and existence is tied to this problem 
and Pakistan's established enemy is India which is already a 
nuclear power and is not willing to sign the NPT. According to 
political observers, India will be ready to sign the NPT when it 
has attained its goal to forcing Pakistan to sign it. 
  The truth is that the United States wants to make India the 
policeman of this region so that Pakistan does not become a 
major power. Pakistan's progress and prosperity will benefit the 
Islamic nations most and the United States wants to keep all 
Islamic countries as its "subordinate dependents." It wants to 
make Israel strong on one side and Pakistan weak on the other 
side. Its stand on Iran is similar and it had destroyed Iraq 
under this policy. The other aspect of the U.S. politics is that 
it does not want to provide India with a "free" atmosphere so 
that it does not unite with China which could confront the "new 
world order." Since Iran, China, and India talked about regional 
unity, the U.S. fears have increased. Therefore, the United 
States has to review its changed Kashmir policy to make India 
happy and sent Robin Raphel to India to further explain the 
position and remove Indian misunderstandings. In other words, 
India has blackmailed the United States to achieve its goals. 
Thus the defeat the United States has faced in its Kashmir 
policy is the result of India's pressure. It is our bad luck 
that we do not have a "lever" that we can use to pressure India. 
In this situation, we need to review Pakistan's foreign policy 
now.

  [Text] Events Service -- After identifying narcotics 
distribution gangs, agents of the antinarcotics campaign office 
were able to identify and destroy three large gangs of narcotics 
smuggling gangs that were operating extensively in the city of 
Tehran. In this regard the members of the aforementioned gangs 
were arrested and 91 kg of opium and morphine were seized. 
  The Greater Tehran Police Precinct Public Relations Office 
reports: Following the efforts of the personnel of the 
antinarcotics campaign office of the Greater Tehran Police 
Precinct in identifying narcotics procurement and distribution 
gangs and the struggles against smugglers, which they carried 
out in the city of Tehran, the agents clashed with a gang whose 
members had brought large quantities of narcotics directly into 
Tehran from a province in the eastern part of the country using 
heavy vehicles and advanced and clever stashing techniques. 
  After investigations were done, all the members of this gang 
were identified and it was also determined that its leaders were 
not local but were from Zahedan. After continuous surveillance, 
police agents placed one of their safe houses under observation 
and then they succeeded in arresting an individual named Halim 
in the Nezamabad area of Tehran. After being taken to the police 
station and interrogated the defendant admitted that he had been 
engaged in narcotics procurement and distribution working with 
three other people named Reza, Nasir, and Shokrollah, also from 
Zahedan, who were staying in safe houses in Tehran at that time. 
  The agents therefore immediately went into action and 
arrested the aforementioned individuals at the aforementioned 
house, located in [?Punak]. They also seized 61 kg of opium and 
1 kg of morphine. 
  In this regard a file was prepared and turned over to the 
proper authorities along with the arrested defendants. This 
report also adds that after seizing 27 kg of opium from a gang 
importing narcotics into Tehran from the cities of Kerman and 
Esfahan, agents set out to completely destroy this gang. After 
obtaining a court order they were sent to the municipalities of 
Kerman and Esfahan and succeeded in identifying and arresting 
the people associated with this gang. They confiscated a side 
arm from the defendants, named 'Abbas and Qasem. 
  These individuals admitted that the weapon belonged to the 
Esfahan police, that they were being sought for buying 70 kg of 
opium, and that they stole the side arm from this municipality's 
police agents during a false transaction. 
  In this regard a file was prepared and all the arrested 
individuals were turned over to the judicial authorities. 
  According to this report, following reports received from 
the 
Hezbollah nation that an individual named Jabbar had formed a 
gang and was engaged in extensive narcotics procurement and 
distribution, using heavy vehicles and trailers to bring opium 
into Tehran from the nation's eastern provinces, agents of the 
Greater Tehran Antinarcotics Campaign Office began an extensive 
investigation in this regard and were able to identify and 
arrest one of the gang members, named Ahmad. In a search of his 
house they obtained 2 kg of opium. Following his confessions, 
agents were able to arrest three more members of this gang.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan-U.S. Relations--Vain Delusion"] </F>
  [Text] No two countries in the world maintain similar 
relations all the time; these change as the result of different 
situations and events. Pakistan-U.S. relations are no exception 
to this rule. The relations between the United States and 
Pakistan have seen many ups and downs during the last 45 years. 
There have been periods of close and warm relations as well as 
of coolness. Various conditions are affecting the 
Pakistan-United States relations at present and we see changes. 
We have commented on President Clinton's report sent to the U.S. 
Congress the other day. He had made two surprising statements in 
that report: (1) Pakistan is blackmailing India over the Kashmir 
issue and is saying that if the Kashmir issue is not resolved a 
nuclear war will break out between the two countries. In Mr. 
Clinton's opinion this is equivalent to Pakistan trying to 
blackmail India. (2) The U.S. President also has said that the 
situation will remain dangerous and peace cannot be established 
in South Asia until the Kashmir issue is resolved. 
  President Clinton's sentiments have not only surprised but 
also worried the people of Pakistan. They have been forced to 
wonder why did this change in the U.S. stand occur so suddenly. 
Only yesterday, a ranked U.S. official, Robin Raphel, had said 
emphatically that the United States considered Jammu-Kashmir a 
disputed region and a decision needed to be made about its 
future. In addition to Robin Raphel, other U.S. spokespersons 
had expressed the same opinion. It appears that when India 
reacted strongly to this statement and used various tactics to 
pressure Ms. Robin [Raphel] and the United States, the United 
States was forced to change its stand. Recently, India and the 
United States held secret talks in London to discuss India's 
nuclear program. These talks were unsuccessful and India refused 
to make any agreement with the United States about its nuclear 
program. Its important officials have announced that India will 
continue with its missiles program as scheduled and will 
complete all tests by this coming July. These events indicate 
that India is not willing to listen to the United States. The 
Indian prime minister is visiting the United States these days. 
The Indian government and news media have used various tactics 
to pressure the U.S. government. They are trying to achieve all 
Indian goals during Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit to the United 
States and not to accept U.S. advice or pressure on any issue. 
Against this background, it is not easy to believe the 
statements made by two important Pakistani leaders today. One is 
forced to ask if these expressions are the result of some 
misconception or were made to make Pakistani people optimistic 
without any basis. The Pakistani ambassador to the United States 
said, "The relations between Pakistan and the United States have 
improved amazingly. The United States that was ready to declare 
Pakistan a terrorist nation until yesterday has adopted a very 
amiable attitude toward us. The United States says that if 
Pakistan assures it of freezing its nuclear program, it is ready 
to nullify the Pressler amendment." Similarly, Foreign Minister 
Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali said that Pakistan and the United States 
have agreed to make South Asia a nuclear-free zone. The United 
States will treat India and Pakistan equally on this issue. Mr. 
Asif Ali also claimed that the United States has admitted to the 
Pressler amendment being "a bad law and a very bad policy." We 
are entering a new era in which both Pakistan and the United 
states have agreed to improve and strengthen their mutual 
relations. He also said that the Pakistani stand over Kashmir 
and the nuclear program is better understood in the United 
States now after the recent diplomatic efforts by the government 
of Pakistan. Mr. Asif Ali also claimed that the United States 
has begun to feel that the Kashmir issue is a permanent danger 
to peace in South Asia. These opinions expressed by Dr. Maliha 
Lodhi and Sardar Asif Ali are very encouraging provided they 
represent the situation accurately. This, however, is not easy 
to understand in the light of President Clinton's report 
mentioned earlier. The foreign minister said that the United 
States has declared the Pressler amendment a bad law and a very 
bad policy. It could be really true, but we have not seen any 
proof of it. If the U.S. viewpoint has really changed, why did 
not it reinstate its aid to us? Why did not it decide to supply 
the 38 F-16s we have already paid for? Similarly, if the United 
States has decided not to require us to roll back our nuclear 
program unilaterally and also understands our positions, then 
what reason does it have to keep the Pressler amendment? The 
United States knows that India has refused to compromise its 
nuclear program. Therefore, if it wants to treat both countries 
equally, it should refrain from punishing Pakistan for keeping 
its nuclear program. However, we notice that this did not 
happen. The United States, in order to temporarily suspend the 
Pressler amendment, is asking us to open up our nuclear 
installations for inspection as a price for it. Does it show 
that it is treating India and Pakistan equally? There is no 
doubt that Ms. Bhutto's government is trying to make the United 
states understand its position and has succeeded in it to an 
extent. However, it is not appropriate to make the situation 
look so positive that it does not represent the facts. We hope 
and pray that all blocks in the path of Pakistan-United States 
relations are removed. At the same time, we should not express 
extraordinary optimism and should wait for the results of 
Narasimha Rao and President Leghari's visits to the United 
States. Only then will a clear picture will emerge.

<F P=106> [Article by Nair Zaidi: "Do Not Expect Fairness From the </F>
United States Over Kashmir" 
  [Text] Why are Pakistani or Kashmiri leaders living in the 
United States insisting the United States play an active role in 
resolving the Kashmir issue? This question came to my mind 
repeatedly last week. There are a lot of activities taking place 
because India's Prime Minister Narasimha Rao is visiting 
Washington on 18 May. The federation of Pakistani and Islamic 
organizations, known as the Pakistan-American Congress, held a 
large meeting in Washington on 12 May. There was a dinner to 
introduce Professor William Baker's book, KASHMIR VALLEY, VALLEY 
OF DEATH. The professor had risked his life to collect material 
for this book by visiting Srinagar. The Pakistan-American 
Congress spent lot of resources and time in printing and 
publication of this book. We cannot praise the organizations 
president, Dr. Sakhawat Hussain, and the organizer of the 
Washington ceremony, Dr. Murtaza Arain, for their efforts 
enough. Several members of this group addressed the dinner 
meeting. Sardar Abdul Qayum, president of Azad Jammu and 
Kashmir, also made a speech. 
  Dr. Maliha Lodhi, the Pakistani ambassador, addressed the 
meeting during the day. I was busy with some other important 
activity of the Congress at that time, however, I did manage to 
get a copy of the text of the speech. The ambassador presented a 
balanced view of Pakistan-United States relations. Her speech 
did not include mere promises of green pastures or scenarios 
that scare people. Dr. Maliha Lodhi also presented the unfair 
U.S. position on F-16s and our nuclear program without mincing 
any words. She also made it clear that although Pakistan wanted 
to cooperate with the United States, this cooperation will 
depend on Pakistan's own national interests. She also said that 
if the United Nations or the United States want peace in the 
sub-continent, the Kashmir issue must be resolved. Dr. Lodhi has 
been in Washington only for four months. During this brief 
period she had to visit Pakistan twice for official business, 
take care of Sardar Qayum's visit, Narasimha Rao's visit, and 
President Farooq Leghari's visit. Still, she did not have a 
heart attack and this shows her strong personality. 
  I did not know her personally despite her journalist 
background, and met her after her only arrival here. She has a 
strong grasp on Pakistan-United States relations and 
international affairs. This is not because she was a journalist 
(we have many "pedestrians" in our ranks), but because of her 
personal analyses. I will discuss in a separate column how the 
enemies of Pakistan are disturbed even after her brief stay 
here. This issue will require a lot of details. Her address to 
the Pakistan-United States Congress was a first solid speech 
made to any Pakistani community. It gave glimpses of cautious 
optimism, but also warned that Pakistan was not in any position 
to continue taking steps unilaterally. There was another meeting 
of the organization after this speech and I participated briefly 
in that. What I heard during that meeting brings us to the 
subject of discussion today. The participants were clear that 
the United States, despite its statements, was practicing double 
standards in regard to India and Pakistan. The question was how 
to change the U.S. attitude. Since I was only an observer in 
this forum, I thought that it would be appropriate to express my 
opinion in my own way--this column. I will focus on the Kashmir 
issue at this point. The United States and other Western powers 
will never help Pakistan over Kashmir or the Kashmiris that want 
their state to join Pakistan. The UN Security Council 
resolutions that provided Kashmiris the right to 
self-determination were passed in 1948-49. The forces behind 
these resolutions were Great Britain and the United States. 
Everyone knows that Kashmir should go to Pakistan. Great 
Britain, its Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, and the leader of the 
border commission, Lord Radcliffe, committed deceit and gave 
Gurdaspur to India and opened a land route for the Indian army 
to reach Kashmir. History shows that the Indian military did not 
have fighter planes to send troops to Kashmir. Thus, India used 
planes owned by American companies. It is obvious that these 
American companies must have discussed this with the U.S. 
embassy before cooperating in a war effort. Meanwhile when 
Quaid-i Azam tried to use Pakistani military and air force, the 
British general refused to obey Quaid-i Azam. It should be 
remembered that the same British general was commanding both 
armed forces. Thus, India not only got the privilege of using 
the Indian military and air force openly, but also used American 
civilian aircraft. Lord Mountbatten was India's governor general 
at that time. The strategy that was used in the United States to 
stop the war must have been discussed between the governor 
general and Prime Minister Nehru before agreeing on all these 
tricks. World War II, in which the United States and Great 
Britain were allies, had just ended. The United States had 
become the new superpower in the world. The security policy in 
the Middle East and South Asia, known as East of Suez at that 
time, was managed by Great Britain at that time. It is, 
therefore, assumed that the U.S. policy on the sub-continent for 
any UN resolution was formed after discussions with Great 
Britain. This policy was not based on principles of fairness, 
but to protect the Western interests. This made the country 
established in the name of Islam economically paralyzed and 
Kashmir was given to the Hindus. It should also be remembered 
that the Ottoman Empire had fallen 25 years earlier, and the 
West was able to establish its control in the Middle East after 
the fall of this Muslim empire. 
  Is it possible for us to accept that the Great Britain that 
had dishonestly given Kashmir to India in 1948 would sincerely 
support such resolutions in 1948 that would result in annexation 
of Kashmir to Pakistan? The UN resolutions were only a timely 
strategy. Anyhow, the Pakistani leadership of that time had 
limited military options and accepted this resolution. However, 
as expected, neither did India follow up on it nor did the 
United States and Great Britain press India about it. 
  In 1962, when India's whole military force was occupied 
against China and it could not defend Kashmir, President Kennedy 
wrote to President Ayub Khan not to take any military action 
there. In exchange, the United States was to help Pakistan 
negotiate with India. Agreeing for negotiations at a time when 
we could have taken over Kashmir was a major blunder which only 
the Pakistani leadership could make. The talks were held as 
promised and India continuously repeated that Kashmir is its 
integral part. The United States betrayed Pakistan a second 
time. However, the situations in 1962 and 1965 were very 
different. There was no local movement in Kashmir that could 
endanger the Indian government. There were some wolves in "lion" 
clothes in Kashmir that wanted to strengthen their position by 
selling out the Kashmiri people. 
  The situation, however, changed between 1987 and 1989. A 
pure 
local movement in Kashmir was born and men, women, and children 
of Kashmir were ready to sacrifice their lives, souls, and 
property. They have made unprecedented sacrifices. However, when 
this movement reached its apex in 1989-90, a group surfaced that 
began to demand that the United States should play a role in 
resolving the Kashmir issue. Seeing how the United States has 
played no role in the whole history of the Kashmir dispute, this 
demand is ridiculous. A lobby was formed here and the Kashmiri 
American Council hired a lobbying firm for $500,000 per year. 
Its purpose was to persuade the government and the U.S. Congress 
to put pressure on India over Kashmir and take notice of human 
rights violations in Kashmir. This whole lobby effort should 
have been focused on one thing: the United States should be 
non-aligned in this dispute and not put any kind of pressure on 
Pakistan to stop helping Kashmiri freedom fighters. However, 
after this lobbying firm was hired, the Kashmiri freedom 
fighters were called terrorists and Pakistan was accused of 
encouraging terrorism. The Pakistani strategy should have been 
simple. It should have provided full support to the Kashmiri 
freedom fighters and prepared itself to withstand the U.S. 
pressure for a short period. Had it warded off this pressure 
until 1993, the Kashmiri movement would have made remarkable 
progress. 
  Those who are sincerely demanding U.S. involvement in 
Kashmir 
are naive. Why should the United States and other Western powers 
help "resolve" an issue that could end the differences between 
India and Pakistan? Their goal is to keep us divided and not 
unite us. have these powers even given a fair treatment to any 
international issue until now? 
  The lobby firms working for Pakistan and Kashmir should have 
the strategy aimed at keeping the United States out of Kashmir 
and let the freedom struggle achieve its goal. No slave nation 
in the world has managed to get the gift of freedom from 
negotiation tables. If this movement is suspended now, there 
will no such movement again for a hundred years. Kashmir will 
become an international brothel if it comes under the 
trusteeship of the United Nations and Western powers. Now only 
will chastity be violated, it will then be sold. The people who 
are trying to "solve" the Kashmir issue with the U.S. help will 
be responsible for that!

<F P=106> [Article by Nasrullah Gazalzai: "HATF Production Stopped"] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Abul Kalam, the Gandhian missile man of India, 
said about his missile program, "India has attained such missile 
power that it can drop its selected missiles anywhere it wants. 
A decision will be made by the government whether to use 
missiles for launching atomic bombs or coventional bombs. The 
success of the Agni missile demonstrates the success of this 
technology, in which India has attained expertise. Prithvi is a 
surface-to-surface missile of international standard. Nag is an 
anti-tank missile. Akash is a surface-to-air missile that is 
unequaled in its division. Tarishul is also a surface-to-air 
missile of high standard. These missiles will shoot at double 
force when used over the ocean. Agni is an answer to the MTCR 
[Missile Technology Control Regime] imposed on us. We are able 
to fire missiles over 1,000 to 2,500 kilometers, and even 
farther. At the end of the year, Prithvi will be presented to 
the Indian military for its use. We have learned that Pakistan 
has obtained M-11 missiles from China. Prithvi will be the 
answer to this." 
  If we join this Indian program with its space program and 
its 
efforts to obtain cryogenic engines from Russia, then it is 
clear that India is making rapid progress in developing 
non-traditional weapons. 
  We had to refer to this non-traditional war program of 
India's because the military, political, and diplomatic experts 
from the United States, as individuals and as a team, had been 
visiting Pakistan before Deputy Secretary of State Strobe 
Talbott's visit to Pakistan and India. Everyone knows that U.S. 
General P. Hoover has visited Pakistan more than once. During 
this period, he went to inspect Siachen, the roof of the world, 
to see the Pakistani military front and meet the soldiers there. 
Both these visits were made public through the eyes of cameras; 
however, there was another visit for which there was no camera 
allowed. Only human eyes saw it. The tongues below these eyes, 
however, were tied, and will remain so. What was the purpose of 
this visit, and what did the two parties--the host and the 
guest--get from it? We cannot say anything about this. 
  The man in charge of India's missile program has especially 
mentioned China's M-11, which, according to him, Pakistan has 
installed on its borders. But it is important to remember that 
the United States has made a lot of noise about the transfer of 
M-11s from China to Pakistan. China has repeatedly insisted that 
it did not supply M-11s to Pakistan, but the United States has 
not stoped its campaign. 
  If we analyze U. S. pressure in this context, we can divide 
it into two camps: One is composed of Senator Pressler and other 
members, who are working hard to make Pakistan totally unarmed 
against its enemy India which is loaded with traditional and 
modern weapons. The other group wants to reach this goal 
indirectly. This group includes the Clinton government, and 
Strobe Talbott, as its important representative, has emerged on 
the scene. Before visiting Pakistan he went to India, where he 
was given a flat refusal and was told that India has no desire 
to cap its nuclear program. Still, Mr. Talbott returned 
"satisfied" from there. In Pakistan he was welcomed with a great 
deal of pomp and show. Here the main point of his demands was 
that Pakistan should first cap its nuclear program; should have 
it inspected in such a way that the whole world can see that the 
program has been capped; and it then should destroy its weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  After discussing this agenda, Mr. Talbott telephoned his 
boss, U. S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on 10 April 
1994. 
  "Mr. Secretary, in the context of relations with the United 
States, I can at least say that we have received good news in 
Islamabad. In addition, I consider this trip successful at the 
diplomatic, political, and even human rights levels. 
  "We have established the groundwork for taking concrete 
steps 
in resolving various problems. From my perspective, this trip 
has been totally successful, and I am thankful to my Pakistani 
hosts, who made it possible to attain the solid results that 
will help Pakistan attain its security and political goals, meet 
the goals of the safety and stability of this region, and attain 
the goal of stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons at the 
international level. We have to work together." In response to a 
question, he said, "About the nuclear issue, I can say briefly 
that we have made solid progress, and officials in both 
countries will have to build on the foundation that we laid over 
the last two to three days." 
  During Strobe Talbott's visit, the Benazir government said 
emphatically that it has been made clear to Mr. Talbott that 
Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program. Meanwhile, the 
announcement about a freeze on the nuclear program (at what 
level, no one in Pakistan knows) was made by Benazir during her 
previous rule between 1988 and 1989. The question arises: What 
success was there that it was important to tell Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher, who was working in Washington on his 
day off? 
  If we take a closer look at this "success," two things 
become 
clear. First, a few days earlier, the talented Pakistani 
scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan said, "I have nothing to say 
about the nuclear policy or program." This is the same Dr. Abdul 
Qadeer Khan the PPP leadership never tired of saying was brought 
to Pakistan by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Therefore, whatever is 
credited to Pakistani is credited to Bhutto I. Now Bhutto II, 
alias Benazir, has put the same scientist in such a situation 
that we cannot explain it in any words. 
  Secondly, Ms. Robin Raphael, a member of Mr. Talbott's 
deputation, said in her earlier visit that a nuclear bomb can be 
fired from even an ox cart or dropped from a C-30 transport 
plane. These words have some relation to Dr. Abdul Qadeer's 
words. Dr. Khan finished the work of enriching uranium in the 
Kahuta plant a long time ago. President Ziaul Haq said about the 
results of this, "We are a screwdriver away from a bomb." 
  Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's interview with Indian journalist 
Kuldip Nayar is on record, and only a few days earlier, during 
Strobe Talbott's visit to India, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao 
said, "Pakistan is a nuclear power, and this has been confirmed 
by the former Chief of Military Staff in Pakistan, Aslam Beg." 
It is not necessary to blast a nuclear bomb to prove you have 
it. These facts and much similar information is available, and 
when the government of Pakistan insists that it will continue 
its nuclear program as is (whether it has been frozen or 
capped), where did the U. S. Deputy Secretary of State have such 
success that he was so overjoyed about that he could not wait 
until the morning, and informed his boss that very night? 
  Let us try to understand the news that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan 
has hinted about. 
  It should be clear that President Ziaul Haq had asked Dr. 
Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team to develop a delivery system 
after attaining nuclear capability. It is common knowledge that 
when the United States provided F-16s to Pakistan, these planes 
did not have a system to drop nuclear bombs. At that time, 
concern was expressed that Pakistan had received "incomplete" 
planes. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team were given other 
responsibilities, and the people of our country saw that 
supercomputers, Giraffe radar, and similar sensitive electronic 
equipment began to show up. In addition, the first phase of 
Pakistani missiles, HATF-1 and HATF-2, were created. This gave a 
shot in the arm to Pakistan's defense forces. As the department 
made progress, India and its supporters in the West began to get 
worried. They thought that with the arrival of these missiles, 
Pakistan's ability to attack farther was improving. It has 
developed a delivery system without which a nuclear power cannot 
be said to have a defense umbrella. 
  Thus, the biggest question for India and the United States 
was how to stop Pakistan from improving its delivery system. 
Under this strategy, the first attack was made on China, 
accusing it of providing Pakistan with M-11 missiles. The U. S. 
government went to extremes in this context, stopping a Chinese 
ship in the open seas and searching it to see if M-11 missiles 
were there. They could only be found if they existed, though. 
But this gives us an idea of U. S. worries. American experts 
have told Pakistan several times that they have information 
about Pakistan gathered from satellites. This information shows 
that China provided Pakistan with M-11 missiles. China and 
Pakistan have denied making such a deal. 
  In any case, the question that emerges with full intensity 
and importance against this background is: Was the purpose of 
Mr. Talbott's visit to stop the Pakistani missile program? Mr. 
Talbott, at the end of his visit here, addressed a press 
conference in which he said, "Both governments have decided to 
stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means 
to launch them. In this context, we have agreed to cap the 
nuclear program, followed by a roll back, and finally, stopping 
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic 
missiles in South Asia." 
  Thus, the evidence that emerged during Mr. Talbott's visit 
to 
Pakistan makes it clear that the United States has changed its 
strategy a bit and made its first priority the finishing off of 
Pakistan's missile program. Thus, without the missiles, nuclear 
weapons can only be used for exhibition, and not for defense. 
The reason for this is clear. The nuclear program has become 
such a sensitive issue for the Pakistani people that ignoring it 
is not possible. Therefore, the United States achieved its goal 
in a different way. 
  In this context, we received the disappointing news that 
Pakistan has stopped its work on the HATF-1 missile program. At 
the site where this program was housed, they announced, "We do 
not want to upset the Americans." Perhaps this is the success 
that Mr. Talbott was bragging about, and he did not waste any 
time informing his boss in Washington about this "success." As 
mentioned earlier, if we look at India's nuclear program, the 
helplessness of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Mr. Talbott's success 
as a series of events, then it should be clear that this whole 
effort was to defeat Pakistan's nuclear program. Benazir's 
agreement with Mr. Talbott to suspend the missile program (it is 
not difficult to confirm this) will harm Pakistan so much that 
it is impossible to make an assumption about it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Principled Stand on Kashmir and </F>
Nuclear Program"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said that terrorism in 
occupied Kashmir must be stopped in order to create an 
atmosphere conducive to talks with India. In her interview given 
to the German weekly FOCUS, she clarified once again the fact 
that our nuclear program is for peaceful purpose and that 
Pakistan was willing to discuss some kind of agreement on this 
issue with India. However, it is not willing to accept this 
responsibility unilaterally. The prime minister said that we 
will not accept any conditions that are imposed on Pakistan 
only. In response to a question about economy, she said that her 
government was successful in reducing the trade deficit by $260 
million, increasing foreign investment by $540 million, and 
increasing foreign exchange reserves from $200 million to $1.2 
billion. In response to another question, she said that the 
countries in South Asia will have to show discernment in order 
to establish lasting peace in the region. The first attention 
must be given to the lingering problems faced by the Kashmiri 
people. Pakistan, she said, was very serious about resolving the 
Kashmir issue and wanted the Kashmiri people to have the right 
to self-determination given to them by the UN resolutions so 
that they can make decision about their future. 
  Countries in this region have to do their duty in order to 
establish lasting peace in South Asia. Refusal to resolve the 
Kashmir issue peacefully and the race to stockpile weapons have 
forced South Asia into a war-like situation. The Indian 
leadership is responsible for the present situation. During the 
last three years, more than 20,000 Muslims have been killed in 
occupied Kashmir and an equal number have been wounded. The 
Indian troops sent to crush the freedom struggle in the Valley 
have gang raped women, burned places of worship and personal 
property, and have set new records for making people invalids by 
torture. The United Nations, international human rights 
organizations, Europeans nations, and other international 
agencies have done nothing except making verbal statements about 
this situation. The people of Kashmir are trying to keep this 
struggle alive by giving their blood. Pakistan has never refused 
to discuss the Kashmir issue and has played an important role in 
all such efforts. Opposed to it, the Indian leadership cannot 
free itself of obstinacy and its emotional stand about Kashmir 
being its integral part. Pakistan still insists that India and 
Pakistan should hold talks for a peaceful resolution of Kashmir. 
However, it is important that India stop the atrocities it is 
committing in occupied Kashmir immediately, lift its siege 
outside places of worship, and set free the thousands of freedom 
fighters now in its jails and special torture cells. Pakistan's 
position on Kashmir and the nuclear program is clear to the 
countries within the United Nations. It is important for 
establishing peace in South Asia to seriously attend to the 
burning questions there. 
  Referring to Pakistan's peaceful nuclear program, the prime 
minister represented our national position to the German weekly 
in her interview. This has been expressed in Pakistan for a long 
time. Pakistan's nuclear program is purely for energy 
production. India, on the contrary, has not only blasted an 
atomic bomb in the seventies but its Tarapur nuclear plant has 
attained the capability of making atomic bombs. India's 
expertise in ballistic missiles is far ahead of Pakistan's. 
  In the present situation where India has the capability to 
make atomic bombs, imposing restrictions on Pakistan over 
nuclear program is blatant injustice. The major powers and 
international organizations should review their approach. 
Pakistan supports the idea of making South Asia a nuclear free 
zone. It has not refused signing the NPT [Nonproliferation 
Treaty] or any other direct agreement. However the question is: 
Why should Pakistan alone do all this? Why do not the United 
Nations and other international organizations convince India to 
give up its nuclear program, sign the NPT, and have a direct 
agreement? Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has represented 
Pakistan's national stand on Kashmir and the nuclear program. 
The question of moving from this position just does not arise. 
If the United Nations is serious about establishing peace in 
South Asia and making it a nuclear free zone, then it should put 
pressure on India not only to stop atrocities on Kashmiris but 
also to let them decide on their future and sign the NPT. The 
whole situation will remain the same until India agrees to these 
points.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pakistan's Principled Stand on Kashmir"] </F>
  [Text] President Farooq Ahmed Leghari said that he 
dismisses any possibility of changing the Line of Control in 
Kashmir into an international border. He said that we cannot 
ignore the Kashmiri people's right to decide their own future. 
We cannot sacrifice the sacrifices that Kashmiri people have 
made for this goal. After the final meeting of a seminar held 
the other day, the president answered news reporters' questions 
and said that he clearly dismissed any effort to make the Line 
of Control a permanent border in Kashmir. The Kashmir issue has 
its own legal and human aspects. It is not possible for 
Kashmiris to give up their right to decide on their own future. 
It is very important to give the Kashmiri people their right 
according to the UN resolutions. He said in response to a 
question that our stand on the nuclear program was very clear. 
While commenting on the position taken by U.S. Congressman 
Hamilton, he said that he will discuss this and other issues 
with U.S. officials during his visit to the United States. 
Dismissing the possibility of making the Line of Control a 
permanent border in Kashmir, he expressed the opinion with which 
the whole nation agrees. Basically, this was proposed by a U.S. 
Congressman on his own and it is not necessary to accept any 
proposal made by the Americans. What the Congressman said could 
be because of his limited knowledge of the situation. The United 
Nations agrees that India should follow up on the UN 
resolutions. India has been deceiving the United Nations for the 
last 45 years and the Kashmiri people's bravery and sincere 
efforts have unmasked this deception. The world is fully aware 
of India's role in Kashmir and Kashmiri people's struggle for 
freedom. It is a fact that India cannot make its point on 
Kashmir at any local or international forum. As a selfless 
supporter of Kashmir people, Pakistan has unmasked India's evil 
role, war crimes, and evil designs to the world. The Indian 
leadership despite being embarrassed is still insisting on the 
correctness of its stand. The only reason for this is that it 
wants to keep its control on this heavenly, Islamic and valuable 
valley. Pakistan has always maintained this stand that India 
should accept the UN resolutions for solving the Kashmir issue. 
The proposal to accept the Line of Control as an international 
border did not surface for the first time. India, England, and 
some other countries have been advising about it in the past 
also. However, no one thought it necessary to consider this 
suggestion. The Kashmir issue basically is not a border issue 
between two countries. It is the question of freedom and the 
right to democracy of about 20 million people. [sentence as 
published] The unprecedented sacrifices the Kashmir people have 
made during he last few years were not made to accept any third 
suggestions and Pakistan cannot force its decision on the future 
of Kashmiri people. It is not a secret what the Kashmiris want. 
If they wanted to accept the Line of Control as a border, why 
would they have sacrificed the lives of 40,000 of their people? 
We cannot stop anyone from giving advice or making suggestions, 
however, neither are the Kashmiris ready to back off from their 
principled stand nor will Pakistan accept any illogical 
suggestion. If the U.S. government is desirous of establishing 
peace in South Asia, it should advise India to stop their 
genocide of Kashmiris and accept the historic facts and 
decisions of the Kashmiris.

<F P=106> [Article by Agha Masood Hussain: "IMF Conditions and the </F>
Federal Budget"] 
  [Text] The graph of Pakistan's economy has been falling 
seriously for the last two or three years. There are many 
reasons for this. The biggest reason is that cotton crops during 
the last two years were badly damaged by special kinds of pests. 
Since the whole textile industry depends on good and plentiful 
harvests, the textile industry and other related industries are 
facing a crisis now. In addition to cotton, the wheat production 
this year was not as good as expected. Therefore, wheat had to 
be imported from the United States. The continuous drought 
during the last three years has effected agricultural production 
as well as electricity generation because of shortage of water. 
Our agricultural and industrial production is also reduced 
because of load shedding. Thus, Pakistan's economic graph is not 
more than 3.5 percent. V.A. Jaffery, prime minister's economic 
expert, claims that our GDP is about 4 percent. Anyhow, keeping 
away from these figures for a while, we have to admit that all 
in all our economy is not satisfactory and production in two 
main departments--agriculture and industry--is declining 
gradually. Thus, Pakistan's budget is being prepared keeping 
this information in mind. This budget is being prepared 
accepting all the conditions laid down by the IMF. As I wrote in 
my column recently, this budget will let the genie of inflation 
out of the bottle and will drown every thing with it. The 
present government accepted the IMF conditions and first decided 
to levy the general sales tax (also known as weight and value 
aided tax). The general sales tax will be levied on every thing 
manufactured in this country. When manufactured goods are taxed, 
the investors will pass this burden to the consumers. This way 
the common people who are already screaming under the weight of 
high prices will also have to bear the burden of general sales 
tax. It is said that the government is planning to increase all 
government salaries by 35 percent. The government will have to 
bear an additional 12 billion rupees expense this way. How will 
the government meet his additional expense? I think it important 
to mention here that when a general sales tax was introduced in 
Europe, consumers had strongly demonstrated against it. The 
government had to use force to control that. Such demonstrations 
are expected to take place in Pakistan also. However, we have to 
see how our government controls these demonstrations. The bosses 
of the IMF want to push Pakistan and other third world countries 
into the trap of unreasonable taxes so that these countries are 
unable to make economic progress because of social upheavals. 
This is a major joke against Pakistan and other third world 
countries. The IMF is demanding reduction of duty on imports to 
help the developed nations benefit and keep their factories 
running. At the same time, it is getting taxes imposed on the 
people to block all ways for them to live proudly. 
  In the context of Pakistan's economic development, it is 
important to mention that the leaders here have no sympathy for 
the poor. Although these leaders come to power by crying about 
the problems faced by the poor people, once they gain power they 
do not even listen to the complaints of these poor people. Also, 
the landlords and investors control power in Pakistan. This 
groups believes that it should rule by keeping people hungry and 
naked. Thus, they do not let the government take any step that 
might benefit the poor. Instead, the poor are told to be 
prepared to face tougher times. It is surprising that only the 
poor are expected to face unfortunate and unfavorable 
conditions. Some of them do not even get a shroud when they die. 
  It would not be out of place or unnecessary to mention the 
Soviet Union in the context of the present economic situation. 
Its merciless bureaucracy and unscientific economic policies 
played an important role in the fall of the Soviet Union. The 
people were silent against the flawed policies and the 
propaganda. No major movement was launched against the 
government there. The result of the "silence" of the people was 
the disintegration of the Soviet Union. The economic problems 
that the people are facing there is known only to them. A 
similar economic and political situation exists in Pakistan. We 
are obeying "orders" from such economic agencies that are not 
ours and are forcing us to take steps in the name of a market 
economy that we might lose everything. Why do we want to make 
progress with aid? Cannot these landlords reduce their luxuries 
and improve the economy of our country? We have India's example 
also. It owes more money than us, but still refused to accept 
the IMF and World Bank conditions. India's Finance Minister 
Manmohan Singh gave such a reply to these organizations that 
they were silenced. The problem in Pakistan is that the people 
in power lack feelings for their country. The middle class is 
not involved in our politics. This results in almost no national 
unity. Meanwhile the bureaucracy and the government are making 
decisions and sending the message to the people to be prepared 
for the coming hard times. The former government had started tax 
on agricultural products to include as many people as people in 
the tax base. However, the state governments have not taken any 
step in this area. One World Bank representative told me that 
the state governments have no plans to levy agricultural tax. 
The question arises: How will the government create additional 
resources? Perhaps, the government itself does not have the 
answer to this question. Those economic experts who are working 
for a specific lobby here do not have any answer to it, 
either!

<F P=106> [Editorial: "IMF Demands"] </F>
  [Text] The IMF and other foreign economic agencies have 
been putting pressure on Pakistan for a long time to reduce 
import duty in order the implement the free market concept. When 
Moeen Qureshi became the care-taker prime minister, he accepted 
this demand immediately and reduced the import duty by 50 
percent. The IMF now is demanding the gradual reduction of 
import duty and its termination in a few years. Pakistani 
economic experts believe that import duty should not be reduced 
more that 5 percent at this time because additional reduction 
will result in extraordinary reduction in government revenues, 
and taxes will have to be increased to make up for this lose. 
Since the taxes are already increasing, this additional increase 
will be an unbearable burden for the people to carry. The other 
aspect of this problem is that the gradual reduction in import 
duty will result in flooding our nation with foreign-made goods, 
which will hurt our local industries very badly. Our nation will 
be transformed into a market for foreign goods to all practical 
purposes. This will adversely effect our efforts to make 
industrial progress and make our national economy independent. 
It is believed that some important and influential persons 
support reducing import duty by 15 percent now and totally 
removing it later. These foreign agencies make these suggestions 
to protect the interests of the nations that give them grants. 
The indebted nations seriously consider these suggestions 
because of their needs and economic problems. However, they 
should keep their own national interests in mind. Against this 
background, we hope that while the Pakistani government 
considers the IMF demands, it will also protect national 
interests.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "PPP Compromised Our Nuclear Program"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Nawaz Sharif, president of the Muslim League 
Party and the opposition leader, has expressed his fears about 
the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government's negotiations with 
the United States and the real results of them. He expressed 
concern about the so-called "quiet diplomacy," saying that in 
the context of Pakistan's nuclear program, the whole nation 
should be worried about this kind of diplomacy, because our 
national security could be jeopardized by such quiet diplomacy. 
According to him, there is nationwide consensus about our 
nuclear program, and the PPP will not get permission from the 
people to negate this national agreement. The basis of this 
consensus among the people is that our nuclear program is 
actually a "holy keepsake" and a very powerful tool to stop 
external aggression. He said that Pakistan has repeatedly 
insisted that the nuclear program should be seen within the 
framework of the whole region, and that a consistent attitude 
should be developed about it. Now these inspections, 
verifications, and quiet diplomacy all mean that our nuclear 
program is being curtailed, and our present national consensus 
is being ignored. Mr. Nawaz Sharif demanded that the PPP 
government issue a clear statement about the nuclear program and 
remove the impression that this government is trying to extend 
its political control and is bent upon jeopardizing our national 
interest and security (THE NEWS daily, 16 April 1994). 
  In our opinion, Mr. Nawaz Sharif's demand that the PPP 
government clarify its policy is meaningless. The PPP 
government's clear expression of Pakistan's nuclear program is 
in the joint statement that was issued at the end of U. S. 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit to Pakistan. 
Its text was published in the newspaper. In the fourth paragraph 
of the joint communique it is stated: "Both governments support 
efforts to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
and the missiles used for launching these. In this context, we 
agree to take the initiative in stopping all production of 
destructive weapons and ballistic missiles in South Asia, 
limiting them, and finally stopping their production totally." 
  This statement makes clear in unambiguous words that the PPP 
government has agreed in principle with the US government to 
stop Pakistan's nuclear program in three phases. This was a fear 
which now has become true. It is equivalent to selling our 
national interests based on the whole nation's agreement in the 
hands of the United States. The whole nation should express 
opposition to it in one voice. 
  We should ask Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto: In south Asia, 
India has not supported the idea of stopping the proliferation 
of nuclear weapons and production of missiles. Thus, why did the 
government of Pakistan support it, and who gave it permission? 
Did Parliament give her [Bhutto] this right? Did she get a 
mandate from the people by holding a referendum? How did she get 
such a right to personally make this decision? How could she 
unilaterally agree, without getting India's support, that the 
production and proliferation of nuclear missiles will first be 
capped, later limited, and then fully stopped? How did this 
emerge as a national position? If this decision was not made in 
an authoritative national body, then how did the prime minister 
get the right to announce such an agreement in a joint 
communique? As the leader of the Parliament of a democratic 
country and as its prime minister, she must get permission and 
approval from Parliament for her decision. She is not the queen 
of a kingdom who can decide the fate of her nation by herself. 
  The joint communique issued at the end of Mr. Talbott's 
visit 
to Pakistan has no legal position, and it was announced without 
any constitutional right. We would tell the opposition leaders 
to understand the importance of this crisis properly and to 
demand that a Parliament session be called, and that the 
Parliament force the prime minister to take back this joint 
communique and disassociate herself from this agreement. 
Otherwise, all of the opposition should walk out of Parliament 
to protest against this insult to Parliament, so that the 
government will be forced to retract this wrong statement and 
will not make any plans to sign any agreements as part of its 
quiet diplomacy. If the opposition ignores the seriousness of 
this situation, then Pakistan's nuclear program will be 
sacrificed on the U. S. altar. All political parties outside the 
government should unite to form a joint position on 
it.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Falling Educational Standards and Senate </F>
Chairman's Warning"] 
  [Text] Expressing concern over the falling educational 
standards and unrest in educational institutions, Senate 
Chairman Wasim Sajjad said that if the educational system is not 
improved our country's existence will be in danger. Every 
concerned citizen would agree with Mr. Sajjad's opinion about 
the deteriorating educational system in our country. Our 
educational system was never coordinated with the needs of the 
nation and we could not get rid of the British system of 
education even after independence. The main purpose of that 
educational system was to create office clerks. This system is 
totally decayed now because of bribery, nepotism, corruption, 
and political interference in schools. Cheating in examinations 
has become the rule. "Cheating mafia" and other control groups 
have taken over the examination centers. Kalishnakovs and 
political influence are used to allow students to openly cheat 
in examinations. Thus, some students pass examinations without 
learning anything, and the bright students who really want to 
learn are deprived of their right and feel discouraged. The 
political parties have affected the educational atmosphere in 
these institutions very badly. The students waste more time in 
political activities than in learning. Many schools are closed 
because of confrontations between student groups. The hands that 
should carry books carry kalishnakov rifles. Thus, we are moving 
towards degeneration very rapidly. The world is changing very 
fast and the speed with which science and technology are making 
progress calls for us to improve our educational system. 
However, because of our administrative weakness, dishonesty, and 
corruption, we are moving toward the goal of ignorance. This 
unfortunate situation has deteriorated so badly that mere 
ceremonial talks will not alleviate this problem. All sections 
of our society have to unite and try with full responsibility to 
improve this situation. Otherwise, our paralyzed education 
system will make Mr. Wasim Sajjad's fear that our national 
identity and existence is in danger become true. Our leaders 
should understand fully that unless we improve our educational 
system thoroughly, we will cannot make an important place for 
the nation at the international level.

officials said Thursday. 
  "Senior department officials protested to him about the test 
yesterday (Wednesday) and reiterated our view that it was deeply 
disappointing," said a spokesman for the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade in Canberra. 
  China carried out the underground blast, which had a

  [Text] Doboj, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim forces were 
attacking Serb positions in the Teslic area, northern Bosnia, on 
Monday and Tuesday night, using all weapons available, including 
missiles charged with poison gases. 
  The brunt of the Muslim attack was launched on the southern 
part of the Teslic battlefront and on the Kozilo area, which 
came under a cannonade of artillery shells charged with poison 
gas, Bosnian Serb army sources said on Wednesday. 
  The Serbs were forced to respond fiercefully [as received] 
and neutralize the Muslim shelling in order to protect their 
positions and the people of Teslic and the adjacent villages. 
  Serb forces have prevented two Muslim terrorist actions in 
the south-eastern Teslic front. 
  The Serb army sources said that Muslim forces at about 5 
a.m. 
(local time) on Wednesday opened heavy anti-aircraft gunfire on 
Serb defence positions in Lukici, eight kilometres west of the 
Serb town of Brcko, in northern Bosnia. 
  From the northern Bosnian Croat enclave of Orasje, Bosnian 
Croat forces and Croatia's regular troops on Tuesday night 
opened strong infantry fire on Serb positions seven kilometres 
away from the area, leaving one Serb soldier lightly wounded.

Corps] 
  [Text] [words indistinct] tanks, the Chetniks in this 
region are also using chemical agents in order to lessen the 
combat strength of our units. After they had used chemical 
agents several times, they launched infantry attacks, which, as 
in the past, were futile and unsuccessful. Unable to realize 
their intentions, the Chetniks shelled civilian facilities 
according to their old scenario, though not as intensively as in 
the past few days. 
  The aggressor has used all the available weapons in the 
offensive on our defense lines. Fresh forces are coming from 
the so-called Yugoslavia. This is evident from the mobilization 
calls sent via the aggressor's media. The media reports that 
brothers from Nis will help (?these) Serbs in liberating Serbian 
territories. To what extent the aggressor considers important 
the regions of Bugojno, Turbe, and Vlasic is evident from the 
fact that it has issued mobilization calls to women. The 
Serbian media is devoting most space to appeals for blood 
donors. This is the best illustration of the losses that the 
Golden Lilies of the 7th Corps of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have inflicted on them.

  [Text] A news conference held in Usti nad Orlici today was 
dedicated to the alleged production of virological and 
bacteriological weapons in Techonin, East Bohemian region. Our 
correspondent Zdena Cela filed this telephone dispatch: 
  [Cela] The military Immunology and Bacteriology Research 
Institute in Techonin in Usti nad Orlici district has never 
produced, developed, or stored military bacteriological weapons. 
This is what Dr. Jiri Beran, dean of the Hradec Kralove-based 
Military Medical Academy who is in charge of scientific work, 
told the news conference today. Development of a combat 
biological agent is above all a matter for top scientists in the 
sphere of gene handling and genetic engineering, Beran went on 
to say. The point is that all the agents have been identified 
[zmapovat] and if one wants to develop a new agent, a new part 
of a genetic information [carrier] would have to be inserted [in 
the already identified agents]. No work has ever been done on 
this subject at the Military Medical Academy. 
  Dr. Beran explained the attacks waged by CESKY DENIK in 
March 
this year by saying that editors have little knowledge of the 
subject and are unwilling to look deeper into the problem. 
  The matter is being investigated by the Defense Ministry 
inspection team and by an interministerial commission.

  [Excerpt] The United States is urging Israel to ratify the 
international convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
within a few months. Israel will respond to this U.S. request, 
which was recently received here, by the end of the month. The 
Defense and Foreign Ministries are preparing to hold 
consultations on the reply. 
  On 22 May, a discussion on the Chemical Weapons Convention 
[CWC] was held at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' office. 
Israel signed the convention in January 1993. In its reply to 
the United States, it will presumably announce that since the 
ratification date is not until next year, Israel will not 
address the issue at the present time. To prevent the CWC from 
harming its security and to ensure a Middle East free of 
chemical weapons, however, Israel will demand that Arab 
countries also sign the convention. [passage omitted]

Problems of Disarmament, Energy Development and Environmental 
Protection (Moscow Physics and Technology Institute): 
"Plutonium: New Aspects of National and International Security"] 
  [Text] A high-level U.S. delegation to include 
representatives of Congress and the Department of Energy will 
arrive in Russia in May to consult on the issue of shutting down 
nuclear reactors in the "closed" cities of Tomsk-7 and 
Krasnoyarsk-26. 
  This visit by American government experts is taking 
place within the framework of agreements reached between 
Chernomyrdin and Gore in December 1993 regarding the creation of 
a joint working group to study and develop a number of issues 
connected with nuclear arms reduction. During the May visit 
there are plans to: study opportunities for achieving greater 
transparency and irreversibility in nuclear arms reduction, and 
placing civilian plutonium and surplus military plutonium under 
monitoring; discuss the technical details of mutual inspections 
of sites where parts made of fissionable materials are stored; 
and discuss possible means of utilizing plutonium to prevent its 
accumulation. This is a multifaceted issue and involves not only 
technological aspects, but serious political aspects as 
well. 
  By the mid-1980's the nuclear arsenals created by the former 
Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War totalled 
more than 60,000 nuclear warheads. Of that number, more than 
one-half belonged to the USSR. The process of nuclear 
disarmament begun by the two superpowers and the development of 
that process, in which the collapsed USSR's place has been taken 
by Russia, will result in a sharp reduction in the size of that 
arsenal. In compliance with the START I and START II treaties 
the total number of strategic warheads retained by each side 
must not exceed 3,500 by the year 2003. Taking into 
consideration unilateral pledges to reduce tactical nuclear 
weapons, over the next decade Russia and the United States will 
have to destroy several tens of thousands of warheads. The 
result will be a sharp reduction in the threat of nuclear war. 
  According to various estimates, the process of destroying 
nuclear warheads will result in Russia and the United States 
freeing up a total of approximately 900 metric tons of highly 
enriched uranium and more than 100 metric tons of weapons-grade 
plutonium (approximately 50 metric tons for each country). These 
two materials are the basis for the manufacture of nuclear 
detonation devices. It takes 3-5 kg of plutonium to make a 
single nuclear device, and three or four times that much highly 
enriched uranium. Therefore acquisition of these materials is a 
priority goal for states seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. 
  The existence of surplus fissionable materials presents a 
threat both to Russian and U.S. national security and to world 
security. Retention of those materials retains the possibility 
that they will be used to make nuclear weapons again, thereby 
undermining the irreversibility of nuclear disarmament efforts. 
The emergence of any crisis in Russian-American relations could 
quite easily provoke a resurrection of the nuclear arms race. 
Therefore the goal should be the permanent removal of these 
materials from the military realm. For Russia the situation is 
made more difficult by internal political instability, 
slackening of state monitoring functions, and a difficult 
economic and environmental situation. Consequently, for it the 
choice of the optimum means of utilizing (or destroying) surplus 
weapons-grade fissionable materials and monitoring them is a 
task of priority importance. 
  Highly enriched uranium (which consists primarily of the 
U-235 isotope) may be de-enriched by mixing it with natural 
uranium and then used in the production of fuel for the nuclear 
power industry. An agreement has been reached under which Russia 
will sell the United States uranium with an enrichment level of 
4 percent for the purpose of manufacturing fuel. Within the 
framework of that agreement 500 metric tons of Russian 
weapons-grade uranium made available through warhead elimination 
will be reprocessed over a period of 20 years. The value of this 
contract is in excess of $12 billion. A separate agreement also 
provides for mutual monitoring measures that will prevent Russia 
from using uranium that does not come from military sources and 
America from using the uranium for purposes not stipulated in 
the contract. Thus there are presently no technical or political 
obstacles to the utilization of weapons-grade uranium. 
  Plutonium is a different matter. Neither Russia nor the 
United States currently has any real means of destroying it or 
utilizing it. Realizing the nationwide scale of the plutonium 
issue and the fact that plutonium is one of the most closely 
guarded topics, decisions in regard to which are made by a small 
group of experts, I would like to direct public attention to 
this matter as well. 
  Plutonium is in the group of transuranium elements, and is 
number 94 in Mendeleev's periodic table of elements. It does not 
occur naturally on Earth, and was obtained by artificial means. 
The first samples were created by the Seaborg Group (United 
States) in 1941 by bombarding with neutrons a uranium nucleus 
with a mass number of 238. 
  Just like U-235, plutonium-239, when it interacts with 
neutrons, breaks down, releasing energy and neutrons, which are 
essential in maintaining a nuclear chain reaction. It is this 
characteristic that makes it a strategic material. It is used to 
produce nuclear weapons, and its small critical mass compared to 
U-235 makes it preferable as a source of nuclear detonation. 
  The toxic effect of plutonium on living organisms is due to 
the alpha particles formed when it decays. Alpha particles that 
enter living tissue destroy the tissue at the cellular level. 
The radioactivity of one gram of weapons-grade plutonium is 
approximately 0.7 curie. Therefore just 2 micrograms of that 
type of plutonium in the body of a human being weighing 70 kg 
could prove fatal. 
  Weapons-grade plutonium is produced in special industrial 
reactors with a low level of fuel combustion. These are 
graphite-water fuel-channel-type reactors with an output of 
around 2,000 megawatts. There were 13 such reactors in the 
USSR/Russia: five at Chelyabinsk-65, five at Tomsk-7 and three 
at Krasnoyarsk-26. According to various estimates, the former 
USSR had produced approximately 150 metric tons of weapons-grade 
plutonium. There are only three reactors still in operation -- 
two at Tomsk-7 and one at Krasnoyarsk-26 -- but they increase 
the quantity of weapons-grade plutonium, for which Russia no 
longer has any use, by two metric tons a year. 
  Plutonium can also be produced by any nuclear power plant 
operating on ordinary uranium fuel. But nuclear power plant 
reactors that have a high level of fuel burn-up produce 
energy-grade plutonium. Note that energy-grade plutonium can 
also be used to made a nuclear detonation device. 
  All the technological steps involved in obtaining plutonium 
are accompanied by the creation of a large quantity of liquid 
radioactive waste. The process of setting up radiochemical 
technology and the operation thereof result in radioactive 
contamination, among other things by plutonium, of huge areas 
where the radiochemical production facilities are located: the 
Mayak Production Association in Chelyabinsk Oblast, the Siberian 
Chemical Combine at Tomsk-7 and the Krasnoyarsk Mining and 
Chemical Combine at Krasnoyarsk-26. Restoring these contaminated 
areas will require a tremendous amount of work. 
  According to figures cited in American articles, the 
production of a single kilogram of weapons-grade plutonium 
involves the creation of four cubic meters of liquid radioactive 
waste with a radioactivity concentration of 2 Yez [expansion 
unknown] curies/cubic meter and a plutonium concentration of 
0.005 kg per cubic meter. Thus the former USSR's production of 
150 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium was accompanied by 
the creation of liquid radioactive waste containing as much as 
half a billion curies of radioactivity. A substantial portion of 
this radioactivity was pumped into underground clay strata (at 
Tomsk-7 and Krasnoyarsk-26). At the Mayak combine these wastes, 
totalling 570 million curies, are stored in steel containers. 
The explosion of one such container in September 1957 resulted 
in the release of 20 million curies of radiation into the 
environment and the radionuclide contamination of 23,000 sq. km. 
The population of that area was 272,000, more than one-third of 
whom were subsequently resettled. The current proposal is that 
the stored highly radioactive waste left over from the defense 
program be vitrified, yet at this time there is no reliable, 
functional vitrification technology. 
  Plutonium's strategic significance and extremely high 
radioactivity require a responsible approach to its storage and 
the selection of a means of utilizing it. Among the proposals of 
various means of utilizing weapons-grade plutonium there are two 
that are preferable from the current standpoint: use as fuel in 
nuclear power plants or vitrification along with the radioactive 
waste created during its production, with subsequent burial of 
the waste. 
  Both these proposed means do not destroy the plutonium as 
such, they merely shift it from the weapons-grade category to 
reactor grade. It is essential to note that the greater portion 
of the plutonium produced in the world as of the present time by 
energy-producing nuclear power stations--approximately 700 
metric tons--is contained in spent fuel. It is assumed that this 
fuel's high level of radioactivity serves as a sort of physical 
"self defense" and prevents the extraction of plutonium from it 
without highly developed technology. Vitrification also reduces 
weapons-grade plutonium to the standard for "spent fuel." 
  At the present time none of the proposed methods has any 
convincing scientific, technical or economic arguments to 
support it, therefore use of any one of them will require a 
preparatory period of at least 10 years. In this context 
cooperation between various organizations in the United States 
and Russia aimed at thoroughly studying all possible means of 
utilizing plutonium appears highly desirable. 
  It is worth noting that the choice of a means of utilizing 
weapons-grade plutonium will also be influenced by such factors 
as the adoption of a concept for the fuel-and-energy cycle. A 
number of countries--France, Belgium, Russia and until recently 
Great Britain, Japan and Germany--support the concept of a 
closed fuel cycle. But only France has made some progress with 
regard to the use of extracted plutonium to produce fuel. As of 
the present time Russia has extracted approximately 30 metric 
tons of energy-grade plutonium, which is stored at the Mayak 
combine. However, in contrast to France, Russia does not 
currently possess the ability to utilize it. 
  The utilization concept for weapons-grade plutonium drawn up 
by the Ministry of Atomic Energy presumes that it will be used 
as fuel. Within the framework of that concept there are plans to 
utilize either existing VVER-1000 reactors or the BN-800 [fast 
neutron] reactors that are under construction at the South Urals 
Atomic Power Station. It is possible that specially designed 
thermal reactors will also be used. 
  VVER-1000 reactors could be used to denature weapons-grade 
plutonium using a 30 percent MOX fuel charge (MOX fuel is made 
from a mixture of slightly enriched uranium and plutonium). 
However, extensive preliminary work will be necessary to assess 
the capabilities of reactor control and protection systems and 
to analyze the effects of possible accidents. Furthermore, 
Russia does not have an existing enterprise producing MOX fuel 
for the VVER-1000, and construction of the RT-2 complex at 
Krasnoyarsk-26 has been suspended. 
  Nor can the idea of using fast neutron reactors be 
implemented immediately, due to the lack of such reactors. The 
existing BN-600 reactor uses uranium fuel, and BN-800 reactors 
are still under construction. Complex 300 at the Mayak combine, 
designed to produce MOX fuel for BN-800 reactors, is currently 
in a state of 50 percent readiness. 
  The United States supports the concept of an open fuel cycle 
and currently rejects reprocessing, primarily for two reasons: 
1. reprocessing would encourage the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons; and 2. the use of uranium to produce fuel for power 
reactors is currently much more economical than the use of 
plutonium. 
  Although the United States does not preclude the possibility 
of reprocessing fuel in the future, at the present time it has 
no desire to signal that weapons-grade plutonium has any 
significance as an energy source, thereby giving the nuclear 
power industry hope of receiving additional government subsidies 
for the development and construction of a new generation of 
nuclear reactors. 
  Thus both countries will be forced to store their plutonium 
for a fairly long period of time. We should note that storage is 
an expensive undertaking. According to various estimates the 
cost of storing a single gram of plutonium is $1.00-2.00 per 
year. Moreover, Russia, according to statements by Ministry of 
Atomic Energy officials, does not possess an appropriate storage 
facility, creating difficulties both with regard to the warhead 
disassembly process and the implementation of reliable 
monitoring. The cost of building an appropriate storage facility 
is estimated at several hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Responding to requests from Russian officials, the U.S. Senate 
has passed a special act under which Russia will be allocated 
$400 million to help with disassembly of its warheads (the 
so-called Nunn-Lugar bill). However, this bill states that the 
money may be used only upon receipt of convincing evidence that 
Russia will not use the materials thus made available to produce 
new nuclear warheads, and that the United States will have the 
right to monitor the nuclear weapon dismantling process in 
Russia. Whereas the first condition seems quite reasonable and 
acceptable, the second has clearly discriminatory overtones and 
is unlikely to be accepted by Russia in that form. The solution 
might be an agreement on mutual monitoring. The primary argument 
in favor of that approach is the fact that agreements regarding 
mutual monitoring of nuclear arsenals will provide a solid 
political foundation upon which to strengthen the nuclear 
non-proliferation system and get the other nuclear countries 
involved in the nuclear disarmament process. However, 
achievement of a comprehensive agreement including provision of 
complete information on nuclear weapons arsenals, the full 
amount of fissionable materials produced and the process of 
nuclear weapons storage and destruction will require much time 
and could thus have an effect on the rate of destruction. 
Therefore it would be more appropriate to move toward that goal 
in stages by concluding a number of intermediate agreements on 
monitoring of newly produced weapons-grade plutonium, on a 
complete halt to such production, and on transfer, under 
bilateral monitoring, of a portion of the plutonium freed up by 
the process of warhead elimination. At the present time both 
sides are conducting consultations toward this end. Achievement 
of these agreements could create a good foundation for progress 
on the issue of monitoring the disassembly of warheads slated 
for destruction and in the direction of a full-scale exchange of 
data regarding nuclear arsenals. 
  One possible solution to the issue of a Russian storage 
facility could be to conclude a bilateral Russian-American 
agreement on the transfer of surplus weapons-grade plutonium in 
both countries to bilateral or international control under the 
aegis of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This would make 
it possible to resolve issues relative to the funding of its 
construction and create certainty about reliable storage and 
monitoring of surplus weapons-grade plutonium until such time as 
reliable means of utilizing it have been developed.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Filonov, Atominform Central Scientific </F>
Research Institute laboratory chief, under "Polemics" heading, 
entitled "What Kind of Chemical Weapons Elimination Concept Does 
Russia Need?" Article is a response to the 30 April 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview with A. Kuntsevich which appeared 
in the 11 May FBIS Arms Control Report, p. 6.] 
  [Text] In January 1993 Russia signed a convention banning 
the development, production, stockpiling or use of chemical 
weapons and requiring their destruction. The convention was 
drawn up with participation by 70 states, with negotiations 
extending over a period of 10 years. In October 1993 all the 
U.N. member states approved it, the kind of full consensus that 
one rarely finds in international affairs. Now the world 
community is closely following the process by which the 
Convention is considered and ratified by the principal 
countries, i.e those that produce chemical weapons. These 
includes the states of the European Economic Community, Japan, 
China, the United States and Russia. The statutes of the 
Convention will take effect 180 days after the 65th ratification 
resolution is handed over for safekeeping, but not earlier than 
two years after its completion and signing, i.e. not before 
January 1995. 
  Now it is already May 1994, and the day is not far off when 
the Russian State Duma will have to make a decision regarding 
ratification of the Convention. 
  Parliamentary hearings on this issue were held on 24 March. 
All those attending were of one opinion: the Convention must be 
ratified, because that is in Russia's national interest and will 
help establish a more lasting peace on our planet. However, 
those attending also expressed concern that as we take this 
responsibility upon ourselves we must also measure our 
capabilities, and in that context it is above all essential to 
have a tool for implementing the Convention requirements: a 
"Concept for the Elimination of Chemical Weapons (CW) in 
Russia." A draft concept was in fact presented at the 
parliamentary hearings on behalf of the Russian Federation 
Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological 
Weapons Issues. The draft in a way builds on the "Comprehensive 
Program for Gradual Elimination of Chemical Weapons in the 
Russian Federation," which was drawn up by the same committee in 
1992. 
  Were answers to all the questions of interest to those 
attending the hearings found in the proposed draft? 
Unfortunately not. Firstly, the draft concept to a certain 
extent only reflects the issue of destroying toxic agents and 
leaves completely open the problem of how to destroy CW. Yet it 
is a well-known fact that the toxic agent "filling" comprises 
only 10 percent of the total mass of materials slated for 
destruction. Finding ways to utilize the shell casings, bombs, 
filling equipment and special missile components is an equally 
complicated and expensive undertaking. Secondly, the draft makes 
no provision for options with regard to destruction technology. 
In fact, both the Comprehensive Program and the draft Concept 
give exclusive preference to the chemical method. Yet at the 
same time all references to chemical-based technologies are in 
the future tense, indicating that they are still being 
developed. Thirdly, the proposed national Convention is clearly 
biased in favor of foreign technology. 
  That bias is so strong that Point 6, Section 13 of the draft 
flatly states that one precondition for Russia's fulfillment of 
its international commitments with regard to CW destruction is 
"the attraction of financial and technological aid from foreign 
countries in connection with destruction of the Russian 
Federation's chemical weapons, including the construction of 
'turnkey' CW destruction facilities in Russia." It can clearly 
be predicted that implementation of that passage will result in 
Russia's technical and hence political dependency on its Western 
partners. And the insignificant $50 million in U.S. aid intended 
to supply an experimental installation will wind up causing 
billions more to flow out of our country and into foreign banks. 
  Realizing the importance and timeliness of resolving the 
issue of large-scale CW destruction, in addition to Khimprom 
(which manufactures toxic agents) several organizations under 
other ministries have also begun developing various 
technological alternatives, often doing so at their own 
initiative. 
  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported on one possible 
alternative technology for complete and comprehensive CW 
destruction -- use of nuclear explosions (see: NEZAVISIMAYA 
GAZETA, 29 March 1994). There exist other proposals as well. For 
example, the Central Scientific Research Institute for Machine 
Building under the Russian Space Agency has under the direction 
of A. I. Papush, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy 
of Natural Sciences, developed a high-temperature technology and 
created a working model of a unit designed to neutralize highly 
toxic substances. On 29 December 1993 destruction of the 
principal CW components was demonstrated using that experimental 
unit, along with the scientific and technical principles of this 
method. In essence the proposed technological process is based 
on a thermochemical method of transforming a neutralized 
substance. The experimental unit measures 8.0x1.5x1.5 meters and 
has a capacity of 1 metric ton per hour. The unit's mobility 
makes it possible to destroy CW (or toxic agents) at their 
storage sites. Unfortunately, neither the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Defense, represented by its Radiation, Chemical and 
Biological Defense Troops, nor the Russian Federation 
Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological 
Weapons Issues, which was headed until recently by A. 
Kuntsevich, has paid proper attention to this 
domestically-designed innovation. Its inventors were even 
refused access to a certain number of appropriate formulas in 
connection with their demonstration. Yet the "chemical" generals 
have shown some interest in and consented to the conducting of 
tests in Russia using experimental units made in the United 
States and Germany. 
  I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the best 
intentions with which this draft Concept was developed. But the 
national Concept should be understandable to every citizen of 
our country, just as in the end it will not be with "aid" from 
overseas that the problem of CW elimination will be solved, but 
with the money of Russia's taxpayers. 
  What would I like to see in the Concept? Firstly, it should 
reflect the principal ways and means of destroying chemical 
weapons specifically, not just toxic agents, as envisioned by 
the international Convention. Secondly, it should make provision 
for the use of various technologies for CW destruction, 
depending on the state and conditions of CW and toxic agent 
storage. For example, munitions in a hazardous state of decay 
would be destroyed at the site where they are presently located 
using the aforementioned thermochemical method; toxic agents 
stored in large containers would be destroyed at refitted 
Khimprom enterprises; cannister, artillery and airborne chemical 
weapons would be destroyed with the help of nuclear detonation 
technology; and so on. The Concept should confirm the most 
efficient use for each of the proposed technologies, not pit one 
against the other. 
  What must be done in order to accomplish that? It is clear 
that there is no point in assigning the aforementioned Committee 
on Conventional Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues to edit 
the draft Concept a third time. That should be done by a 
different team, which should include representatives of all the 
organizations that are offering various technologies for the 
destruction of CW (or toxic agents), as well as representatives 
of CW customers and manufacturers, environmentalists, doctors 
and economists. Their efforts should be covered by the media in 
a generally intelligible form at both the Federation-wide level 
and at the local and regional levels. This team's primary task 
should be to organize and conduct comprehensive assessments 
(technical, environmental and economic) of all proposed 
technologies, including mandatory demonstrations. After this 
collective assessment has been made, the most environmentally 
safe and economically appropriate CW destruction technologies 
should be determined, and this should not be done independently 
by the customer (the Ministry of Defense), as stipulated in 
Point 5.6 of the draft. 
  I am convinced that if the issue is formulated in this way 
Russia is capable not only of destroying its own CW within the 
established time limits at a minimal cost, but also of providing 
assistance to other countries around the world.

  [Text] Russia is starting the destruction of chemical 
weapon manufacturing equipment. A decision to this effect was 
made by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets following his 
visit of the Khimprom company in Chuvashia which used to 
manufacture chemical shells. 
  The production of chemical weapons was discontinued in the 
factory in 1987 but the equipment capable of doing so has 
remained intact. Soskovets and Chuvashia's President Nikolai 
Fyodorov ordered the compiling of a schedule for the 
stage-by-stage destruction of the equipment. 
  Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State Defense Industry 
Committee, told Interfax that this decision marked the beginning 
of a large scale process in the country. The reluctance on the 
part of the U.S. to sign the appropriate convention might, 
however, hinder the process, he said.

  [Text] Moscow June 7 TASS -- Satisfaction was evoked in 
Russia by statements of the Governments of the United States and 
Great Britain in connection with the implementation since May 
30, 1994, of arrangements between the leaders of the three 
states on detargeting of stategic nuclear missiles. Grigoriy 
Karasin, spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told this a 
briefing on Tuesday. 
  The Russian side again expresses the hope that 
implementation 
by Russia, the United States and Great Britain of the initiative 
for detargeting will precede further measures for 
confidence-building and strategic stability and will set an 
example to other nuclear powers, the spokesman said.

  [Text] As of 30 May 1994 none of Russia's more than 1,000 
strategic missiles on alert duty in silos, on submarines, and on 
road-mobile launchers are targeted against any installations on 
the territory of the United States and Britain, IZVESTIYA was 
told by the Strategic Missile Forces [SMF] Press Center. 
  The missiles have been retargeted in line with Russian-U.S. 
and Russian-British accords and also in connection with the 
Russian president's directive, the military said. According to 
them, the SMF have formulated and implemented special measures 
to organize the daily activity and lives of the troops with 
untargeted missiles. At the same time missilemen have given 
assurances that the missile units' combat readiness remains at 
the same high level.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow 20 May TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko decided to personally look 
into the state of affairs in the Russian Armed Forces on the eve 
of the upper chamber's examination of the military budget. On 
Friday he left for the Ivanovo region, where a missile army is 
stationed. 
  Shumeyko was accompanied on his trip by commander-in-chief 
of 
the strategic missile troops Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. The 
missile army is partly armed with the newest "Topol" missile 
system, destined to become the core of Russia's future strategic 
missile forces. 
  Igor Sergeyev told ITAR-TASS that today's talks between the 
missile troops command and Vladimir Shumeyko would center around 
the problems faced by those troops. These problems, he said, 
"are rooted in the share of the budget which is to be allotted 
the strategic missile troops." 
  Shumeyko will be shown the troops' battle capabilities and 
the main components of the training which those who are 
entrusted with the country's nuclear weapons must undergo. The 
Federation Council chairman intends to meet with some of the 
army's officers as well. 
  Sergeyev said he was grateful to Shumeyko for deciding to 
first visit the strategic missile units before making a decision 
on the military budget. "That is explainable, since the Russian 
military doctrine lays the most responsibility for the state's 
safety and stategic stability on our forces. The strategic 
missile troops are the main component of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces," the general said. 
  He further noted that the many problems encountered by the 
troops are being resolved without compromising their battle 
capabilities and reliability. The strategic missile troops had 
to shoulder most of the responsibility under the START-1 and 
START-2 international disarmament treaties. 
  At present, the commander-in-chief explained, about 60 
percent of the rocket carriers and warheads of the strategic 
nuclear forces are concentrated in the missile troops. These 
types of weapons are due to be reduced to one-sixth their former 
size. Sergeyev also pointed out that, even without any 
international treaties, Russia would have to eliminate the 
weapons which used to be produced in the other ex-Soviet 
Republics. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared at a recent 
press conference that the country's strategic nuclear forces 
were the main guarantee of Russia's security in the modern 
world. At present as well as in the future, the top priority in 
the development of the armed forces will be given to strategic 
nuclear weapons, which are the main deterrent factor against any 
outbreak of hostilities, he said. 
  The divisions and regiments of the strategic missile troops, 
which are at the centre of the nuclear forces, are now being 
technically reequipped. In the last two years, seven more 
missile regiments have been made battle-capable, all equipped 
with new stationary and mobile missile systems. 
  At the same time, strategic missile units are being 
withdrawn 
from the other ex-Soviet Republics. By the end of 1994, another 
four missile regiments are due to be relocated to Russian 
territory.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Russia cannot agree with a 
recent U.S. proposal on an international control system which 
will be necessary if an international agreement on stopping 
nuclear arms tests is concluded, ITAR-TASS learnt on Wednesday 
from reliable Russian sources participating now in the UN 
disarmament conference in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. 
  The multilateral talks to conclude an international 
agreement 
on stopping nuclear tests which started in Geneva last January, 
centre on a system of control. 
  According to the above sources, the American side recently 
offered its own model of control which presupposes the 
simultaneous application of six verification systems and the 
establishment of appropriate global structures. 
  Russian experts believe that it will take at least ten years 
to implement the U.S.-brokered model. Besides, it presupposes 
huge financial outlays, which is objected not only by Russia but 
also by other nuclear powers. 
  In contrast to Washington, Moscow believes that the 
application of two systems -- seismic and atmospheric control -- 
is quite sufficient. According to these sources, this viewpoint 
is backed by many participants in the nuclear tests talks in 
Geneva, including Japan. 
  The U.S. proposal, the official reply to which Moscow plans 
to give in the next few days, puts in jeopardy, as the sources 
stressed, the chance of the timely signing of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty which expires next year. 
  This is explained by the fact that most treaty participants, 
members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the main, insist that the 
nuclear powers should conclude an agreement on stopping nuclear 
tests. They agree to prolong the treaty for unlimited duration 
only under this condition.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] Russia is in favor of reaching agreed-upon decisions 
on the major provisions of a treaty on banning nuclear tests as 
soon as possible (by next spring), the director of the Russian 
Foreign Ministry's press and information department, Grigoriy 
Karasin, said in connection with the talks resumed by the 
Disarmament Conference in Geneva. 
  Russia's Foreign Ministry views these talks as a major 
direction of its efforts in the current year, he stressed at 
Thursday's briefing. He pointed to Moscow's intention to 
"contribute to the endeavors to create favorable conditions for 
next year's conference on extending the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty." 
  As Karasin said, Moscow believes that a "treaty on banning 
nuclear tests should be timeless and have no ceilings; that it 
should provide for an effective system of control and for strict 
sanctions against its violators." 
  According to the diplomat, "Russia favors a realistic and 
evolutionary approach to developing the system of international 
control over the implementation of a treaty on banning nuclear 
tests, which would provide for using at its initial stage 
seismic methods, instruments for surveying radioactivity in the 
atmosphere, and on-site inspections." "Some countries have 
suggested a number of additional methods, but this may 
considerably increase expenses connected with control system and 
lead to delaying the drafting of the treaty," Karasin said.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Geronin and </F>
Aleksandr Kopnov] 
  [Text] Moscow, 2 Jun -- Russia will firmly uphold the 
international nuclear nonproliferation regime, Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin announced today at a state reception in the 
Faceted Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of South 
Korean President Kim Yong-sam. One of the primary goals of this 
is to guarantee a nonnuclear status for the Korean peninsula, 
the Russian head of state stressed. 
  Yeltsin recalled that Russia has proposed an international 
conference on this issue, which could find a comprehensive 
solution to the nuclear issue and in particular bring about 
specific agreements making it possible to reduce and 
subsequently remove the dangerous confrontation on the Korean 
peninsula. The main aim is to begin a movement toward trust and 
cooperation. 
  Moscow is ready to play and will play an active part in 
creating international mechanisms aimed at strengthening a 
climate of trust, security, and cooperation in relations between 
the states of the Asia-Pacific region, the Russian president 
said. 
  Yeltsin expressed confidence that close interaction between 
Russia and the Republic of Korea would help to strengthen 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region. In his words, relations 
with Seoul are one of Moscow's top priorities in the 
Asia-Pacific sphere. 
  Russia, the Russian president pointed out, has historically 
been deeply involved in the affairs of the Korean peninsula. In 
July it will be 110 years since the establishment of relations 
between Russia and Korea. Ties are developing well at the 
present time too. But there is a need to move on and give the 
"green light" to all cooperation projects in all spheres of 
life. This applies first and foremost to the economic sphere, 
the more so since opportunities and reserves do exist for this. 
  Russia wants the speediest possible reunification of Korea 
by 
peaceful democratic means, Yeltsin said. One of the most 
dangerous threats in Asia and throughout the world will thereby 
be eliminated. We want to see Korea as a unified, peace-loving, 
democratic, nuclear-free, and prosperous state and a reliable 
partner of Russia, the president pointed out. I believe that 
the way to achieve this will be found by the Koreans themselves. 
Russia is ready to facilitate the accomplishment of the Korean 
people's cherished goal of unification as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Own Information report: "Two Countries' Parliamentarians </F>
Unite"] 
  [Text] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, there was 
a meeting in Moscow on 30-31 May between deputies of the Russian 
Federation State Duma and U.S. senators involved in defense 
questions. On the U.S. side the working groups were headed by 
Senators S. Nunn and J. Exon, on the Russian side by S. 
Yushenkov and A. Piskunov. 
  The U.S. legislators voiced extreme concern at the state of 
civilian control in the defense sphere in Russia. Special 
attention was paid to the need to monitor the observance of the 
regime governing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and 
nuclear materials and of chemical and bacteriological weapons 
and their components. The Russian deputies accepted the need 
for civilian control within the framework of the approval of the 
federal budget and verification of its implementation as well as 
the ratification of international treaties, backed up by the 
functions of the parliamentary monitoring of their 
implementation. 
  During the meeting there was a broad exchange of opinions on 
the state of affairs in the sphere of strategic offensive 
weapons. The question of extending the Nuclear Weapon 
Nonproliferation Treaty in 1995 was regarded as a priority. The 
two sides agreed that in mutual relations with Ukraine special 
account is to be taken of the delay in the deadline for the 
latter's fulfillment of the obligations under the Lisbon 
protocol on affiliation to the Nuclear Weapon Nonproliferation 
Treaty, which is holding up the entry into force of the START-1 
treaty and the preparation of START-2 for ratification. 
  Despite the persistent attempts to find coordinated 
decisions, it has not yet proved possible to find common 
approaches on the possible levels of the further reduction of 
strategic offensive arms, even though the sides do not deny the 
need for that, or on the creation of the conditions for the 
testing im military theaters of ABM systems relating to the 1972 
ABM Treaty. 
  Considerable attention was paid at the meeting to the use of 
the U.S. resources allocated by the Nunn-Lugar initiative to the 
destruction and recycling of nuclear and other types of arms 
belonging to the Russian Federation. Attention was drawn to the 
fact that these resources are not being used effectively enough. 
Of the $432 million allocated in 1992-1993, the Russian side has 
used less than $100 million. In view of the slow rate at which 
the executive power structures are concluding the relevant 
agreements it was deemed expedient to hold joint hearings on 
this question in fall 1994. 
  It was noted that joint military exercises are an important 
measure for strengthening confidence between the two countries. 
Bearing in mind the complex domestic political situation in the 
Russian Federation, the U.S. side agreed to propose to its 
government that the initial stage of the joint exercises by 
peacemaking forces be switched to U.S. territory.

<F P=106> [Part one of two-part article by Vasiliy Krivokhizha, deputy </F>
director of the Russian Institute for Strategic Research: 
"Future of Russian Nuclear Potential"] 
  [Text] The Soviet leadership's political thinking, 
particularly as regards military-political strategy, used to be 
compared in the old days to studied chess gambits. The 
circumstances of the USSR's collapse and the rapid degradation 
of society call into question the correctness of this 
complimentary comparison -- at any rate as regards the skills of 
many of the "chess players" of the perestroyka period. The 
historians of the future, however, will as usual voice varying 
opinions about 20th century Russian history and about whether 
the last Soviet leadership had an inferiority complex or whether 
they were pioneering a new era, and so forth. What will be seen 
as history by the researchers of the future, for us increasingly 
boils down to the problem of survival. Consequently, as we 
encounter very urgent matters every day it does not seem out of 
place to attempt to sort out at least certain rules and the 
sense of the game in which Russia is a player in the nuclear 
arms sphere. 
  The current era of total change is, apart from anything 
else, 
also a time of radical change in geostrategic realities and ways 
of thinking. The speed and spontaneity of these changes are 
probably the reason why our so-called post-Soviet society is 
parting willingly (and even with unmitigated enthusiasm) from 
the state appurtenances that largely determined the USSR's 
status as a military "superpower." There is something 
irrational -- though easily explained in terms of the systemic 
crisis in society and its revolutionary nihilism -- in the fact 
that we are putting paid with equal measures of indifference 
("we don't need that any more!") to the, in many respects 
controversial but nonetheless technically sophisticated, "Buran" 
(and thus, in practice, to our entire "state-funded space 
effort"); to aircraft-carrying cruisers -- and next it will be 
the turn of the entire oceangoing fleet; and to ABM defense and 
air-defense installations and strategic ground force groupings 
west of Smolensk and south of Sochi. 
  There is, however, a sphere of social and professional 
interests where the consequences of the possible changes should 
be analyzed with particular care and where discussions should be 
conducted by specialists in a constructive spirit without any 
interference from emotions and not necessarily in conjunction 
with other information such as, say, the examination of the 
START II Treaty by the new parliament or the adoption of a 
long-term program for military organizational development. It 
will be a question of the prospects for developing our strategic 
nuclear forces, which can quite justifiably be called the 
scepter in the double-headed eagle's claw. 
  It is time to recognize that behind the numerous discussions 
about the expediency of retaining, removing, or adopting certain 
weapons systems and their quantitative and qualitative 
parameters lies a principled and so fundamental question that 
people prefer not to consider it -- will Russia be able under 
these conditions that are new to it to preserve its nuclear 
potential and in what form? It is no secret that a number of 
important components in the nuclear system that used to exist 
have been lost, and traditional problems such as, for instance, 
the no-first-use of nuclear weapons and the relationship between 
a retaliatory strike and a counterstrike are being reconsidered 
and reinterpreted. Thus, the question of the future of Russia's 
nuclear potential is becoming not so much theoretical as 
practical -- particularly now that the lack of funds and the 
absence of constant and focused attention from top organs of 
power to the problems of the strategic nuclear forces could lead 
to their irreversible degradation. In tandem with this, the 
protracted uncertainty about ratification of the Strategic 
Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) threatens to 
seriously delay the entire future disarmament process and 
introduces additional problems to the choice of the ideal 
solutions for modernizing the Russian Armed Forces' strategic 
nuclear component. 
  Statesmen who should already be taking responsible steps to 
choose long-term avenues for the organizational development of 
nuclear strategic forces are feeling an urgent need for a more 
accurate system of references in the emerging geopolitical 
situation, a need to understand what global military-political 
situation they will have to face in the future. And it is very 
important for them that some fragments of the picture of the 
future -- despite the turbulent processes of change in the world 
order -- are in a number of aspects acquiring new outlines. 
  A typical feature of the emergent era will be a change in 
the 
overall structure of influence in the world. Many specialists 
are noting that the bipolar structure with two opposed 
superpowers -- the United States and the USSR -- is being 
replaced by a more traditional multipolar structure which, by 
reducing the opportunities for the superpowers to determine the 
course of world development, will enhance the role of other 
countries (such as the countries of Europe and the Pacific 
region), diversifying the arsenal of their ways and means of 
influencing world politics. According to a number of forecasts, 
the weakening of U.S. economic positions in favor of West Europe 
and Japan will make the United States' bonds of alliance with 
its partners in Europe and Asia more short-term and unstable, 
and international relations more complex, unstable, and less 
predictable as a result. Hence, the overall political situation 
in the world may be less predictable, hard to control even at 
regional, not to mention global, level, and likely to result in 
the emergence of acute crises and the appearance of additional 
spurs to confrontation. The distant rumbles of thunder can 
already be heard. 
  In the context of a multipolar world with criteria of 
influence and stability that are somewhat different and by no 
means always advantageous for Russia, when additional room is 
created for multilateral political maneuver, allies can very 
quickly become enemies, and the principle of "every man for 
himself" (remembering G. Washington's behest) prevails 
increasingly clearly in politics -- under these circumstances it 
is hardly sensible to rush into all-out disarmament, giving up 
our national nuclear forces or even discussing handing them over 
to some kind of collective control. It would be an unforgivable 
mistake, giving in to complacent ideas about the end of the era 
of confrontation, to "tear the tails off" all Russia's strategic 
missiles, although this does not at all mean that we should not 
use the entire panoply of peaceful means of safeguarding 
Russia's national security or that we should end the disarmament 
negotiations. 
  The range of opinions on this issue, particularly now that 
politics has become part and parcel of our public awareness, is 
quite broad. Thus, there is a view (voiced in particular by 
ISKRAN [expansion unknown] staffers S.K. Oznobishchev and A.V. 
Surikov) that at a time of the transition to the building of 
strategic partnership relations between Russia and the United 
States, the use of the strategic stability criteria which were 
successfully used in the postwar decades is becoming senseless. 
Since this is the case, despite all the reservations befitting 
the current situation, nuclear weapons are allegedly becoming a 
kind of burden for Russia and should be gradually turned into 
the "last guarantee" of the security system "not only for Russia 
and the United States in isolation, but perhaps for a whole 
group of states united behind the principles of a collective 
security system within the UN framework." 
  Admittedly, it seems as though the United States is not yet 
ready to share with Russia its experience of these innovations, 
even though their general human and humanitarian thrust is 
evident. The nuclear powers' lack of enthusiasm on this subject 
is possibly explained by the fact that achieving an ideal 
combination of individual and collective means of defense is a 
complicated task with no single solution. But that is a 
separate discussion. The actual agenda is different, and one 
specific problem is that Russia should maintain effective 
national strategic nuclear forces. At the same time, it somehow 
seems as though our enemy now is not any specific country or 
group of countries, but uncertainty (incidentally, the 
transition to planning for uncertainty has already been 
reflected in some official U.S. documents on military-strategic 
issues). 
  If we set out the development of military thinking in the 
nuclear planning sphere extremely simply and without any serious 
distortions, it can be said that the development of nuclear 
weapons arsenals has made certain changes to the targeted role 
of military strategy, which has become more broadly interpreted 
and is seen as a military-political strategy. In reality this 
has meant a change of emphasis in nuclear planning from the 
possibility of directly winning a nuclear war to the sphere of 
implementing political goals by means of the threat of war. The 
concept of political deterrence has supplemented the concept of 
nuclear deterrence -- literally "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" [sderzhivaniye posredstvom yadernogo ustrasheniya]. 
It was based on the principle of the "balance of terror" -- the 
certainty that each party to a potential nuclear conflict would 
inevitably suffer unacceptable damage in any nuclear war 
scenario. The logic of deterrence presupposed the permanent 
building up of the two superpowers' nuclear potentials and an 
increase in the number of nuclear munitions and delivery systems 
to an irrational level (a kind of "foolish multitude") that 
guaranteed the impossibility of one side winning in any 
meaningful way. Implementation of this concept turned into an 
outright arms race. 
At the end of the sixties the stupidity of this approach to 
the organizational development of strategic nuclear forces was 
so obvious that the parties to the confrontation came to the 
conclusion that it was expedient to seek (very cautiously and 
gradually) new approaches to maintaining strategic stability and 
to implementing the concept of combining nuclear deterrence with 
arms control (so far only control). 
  If the strategic nuclear forces of the two states (or 
coalitions of states) are capable of inflicting unacceptable 
damage on each other in retaliation (retaliatory strikes and 
counterstrikes), then both sides restrain each other from 
aggression, military equilibrium exists between the states, and, 
consequently, military-strategic stability in their relations is 
maintained. Thus, deterrence is achieved by the possibility that 
strategic nuclear forces will deliver a retaliatory strike of 
such force in response to an enemy first strike that the idea of 
carrying out a first strike ceases to be attractive. 
  The method of maintaining strategic balance on the basis of 
the use of nuclear deterrence proved its effectiveness from many 
standpoints over the decades. But, like any "precision" 
instrument, it is very fragile and subject to many factors in 
real life. Thus, of itself the conclusion that stability exists 
at any specific moment of time requires a very complex analysis 
of the military-political and military-technical reality, and 
consideration of a huge number of varied and, moreover, variable 
quantities in the most unexpected areas. We can also cite the 
sensitivity of this kind of stability to different symmetries 
and asymmetries in arms systems, and imbalances between rivals 
even within the framework of the "simple bipolar world." Any 
changes in military potentials, on the one hand, promote the 
emergence of excessive suspicion in interstate relations, while, 
paradoxically, on the other hand objectively requiring the 
maintenance of a certain level of mutual confidence. 
  In this context many necessary but unilateral steps to 
sensibly improve national armed forces could upset the strategic 
equilibrium and should therefore be most carefully weighed up 
from the standpoint of whether or not they will be seen by the 
opposite side as an attempt to change the balance in its favor. 
Caution or active enmity can be caused by the improvement of 
the technical potential of conventional (nonnuclear) weapons, 
particularly in terms of warhead accuracy and yield, the 
development [sozdaniye] of any ABM systems with ambiguous roles, 
and so forth. The problem of somebody acquiring a decisive 
military advantage through a technological breakthrough also 
remains very topical. This likelihood does exist, which could 
tempt people to play their "untrumpable" card for the purposes 
of strong-arm blackmail. 
  That is why Russia and the United States, like other states, 
need to improve their strategic nuclear forces in areas that 
strengthen strategic equilibrium. And corresponding joint 
information about weapons systems in service should be envisaged. 
  In order to define the main avenues for the organizational 
development of national nuclear deterrence forces it is very 
useful to comprehensively analyze and take account of new 
concepts which have recently been actively developed and 
actually implemented by Western specialists in the sphere of 
strategic planning. These concepts are based on the initial 
premise that the most realistic threat to the security of the 
United States and its NATO allies now comes not from Russia and 
the other CIS countries but from "authoritarian" regimes (read 
"unfriendly," as distinct, for instance, from "friendly 
dictators"), or regional interstate and interethnic conflicts 
using conventional weapons. It is within the framework of this 
doctrine that Western specialists have embarked on the 
elaboration of new approaches which will define the principles 
governing the use of nuclear arsenals for the next 10-20 years. 
In the United States in particular, in early 1993 L. Aspin, the 
then U.S. defense secretary, had already ordered an urgent 
review of the concept of the use of U.S. strategic nuclear 
forces. Although officially the adoption of the new concept is 
planned only for this year, the main problems that have arisen 
in the course of its elaboration have been covered in sufficient 
detail. In particular, the U.S. strategists will not only have 
to revise the list of targets, but also review once again 
whether the United States needs such a big nuclear potential, 
since maintaining it at its current level costs the United 
States $10 billion a year at a time when the threat of an 
all-out nuclear war has significantly diminished. The military 
are also having to "rethink the methods for deterring new and 
old enemies." 
It is worth noting that, in L. Aspin's opinion (and there is 
hardly any doubt about his competence on geostrategic matters), 
the main threat to U.S. security is now posed not by an 
increasingly predictable ("transparent") global strategic foe -- 
as was the Soviet Union -- but by a whole team of "political 
monsters" in the shape of "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing 
governments that reject international norms." 
  For all the lack of ambiguity in the interpretations of the 
role played by nuclear weapons in the present-day world, the 
renewed U.S. concept of "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" nonetheless remains the most important nuclear 
planning idea for the United States, and the novel aspect of the 
utilization of strategic nuclear forces will most probably lie 
in the search for "some kind of devilishly inventive new 
principles." Nothing is as yet known about these, incidentally 
-- although L. Aspin admitted, discovering compelling reasons 
for it, that the approach of "monitoring the nuclear arsenal 
together with a threat of retribution" which had effectively 
influenced the Soviet Union, "may not frighten the new owners of 
nuclear weapons at all." In this event it cannot be ruled out, 
at least theoretically, that there will be an expanded range of 
missions for strategic nuclear weapons to carry out -- from 
peaceful containment through deterrence on the basis of the 
inflicting of unacceptable damage, to the limited combat use of 
nuclear weapons alongside conventional (nonnuclear) systems. 
The main aim of the limited combat use of nuclear weapons would 
be to prevent a military conflict from developing into all-out 
hostilities -- that is, in an unfavorable direction for the 
state under attack -- and to defuse the conflict. We cannot 
rule out new and original ways of parrying the threat from 
"nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments." For 
instance, the potential threat of nuclear terrorism could be 
eliminated by implementing the idea of global information 
transparency in the nuclear sphere, whereby secret activity in 
manufacturing and moving not only nuclear devices, but in 
accumulating a "critical mass" of fissile materials would become 
impossible. Governments that prove intractable in this area 
could be (as has already happened) removed from the political 
scene for the required period of time by establishing control 
over the ruling elites in these countries or with the help (and 
there are plenty of examples of this too) of limited military 
and other sanctions -- which would easily be feasible within the 
framework of a policy of regionalism or simply under UN mandate. 
But the latter measures might not always be successful -- 
therefore the reality of using strong-arm methods, regrettable 
though it may be, should be retained. 
  We should be more interested in the question of whether 
Russia is ready to propose its own vision of the use of 
strategic nuclear forces. The undoubtedly honest position of 
the new Russian military doctrine -- now being extensively 
commented upon -- on the possible use of a nuclear first strike 
can be seen mainly as a reaction to traditional strategic 
challenges and as being largely brought about by the country's 
situation and, accordingly, by the state of its Armed Forces. 
To all appearances, even the modernization of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces, which is suggested under the framework 
of the treaties on offensive arms reduction, does not make it 
possible to do anything but implement deterrence within the 
framework also of the "traditional" military-strategic situation 
with the criterion of inflicting unacceptable damage on any 
aggressor in retaliatory action. 
  When talking of the category of "unacceptable damage," we 
should take account of present-day views of this problem. We 
realize now that this category has, as it were, two dimensions, 
and can be framed within two systems of coordinates. It is 
usual to consider (and, incidentally, this understanding emerged 
relatively recently), that the criterion of unacceptable damage 
exists simultaneously as a certain quantitative level of losses 
and as a kind of psychological barrier. 
  The question of the norm of unacceptable damage is 
incredibly 
complex. Military specialists honestly admit the failure of the 
numerous attempts to define a more or less objective level for 
it. Staffs in both Russia and the United States are now using in 
their practical activity the mathematical value of a set amount 
of damage (required for deterrence) which nonetheless plays an 
important role in assessing the strategic balance when defining 
the limits of restrictions in the course of drawing up 
disarmament treaties and, most important of all, serves as a 
kind of guideline in shaping major state programs for the 
quantitative and qualitative development of strategic offensive 
arms. 
We should not downplay the positive significance that the idea 
of a quantitative assessment of the force required to inflict 
"unacceptable damage" on an enemy has possessed for the 
development of the strategic situation, looked at 
retrospectively. It was this idea that made it possible to 
conclude more or less objectively that there was nuclear parity 
between the USSR and the United States -- which made it possible 
for one of the parties to dump its psychological baggage and 
provided an incentive for a disarmament process based on mutual 
recognition of the impossibility of either side's winning any 
substantial advantage in the context of balanced cuts in 
strategic offensive arms. At the same time, let us emphasize 
yet again that the criterion of "unacceptable damage" was to all 
intents and purposes never used as the basis for the adoption of 
the "final" decision to launch a nuclear strike within the 
context of the nuclear deterrence doctrine. Its mechanistic 
meaning (incidentally, if it could have been used as a 
guideline, then the choice of the time to launch a first strike 
could easily have been delegated to computers) cannot be related 
to the huge moral responsibility which a political leader would 
have to assume when deciding to start a nuclear war. We need 
only recall the Caribbean crisis, when the correlation of 
nuclear munitions was 17-1 in favor of the United States. (The 
Soviet Union had around 290 nuclear munitions, while the 
Americans had something in the order of 5,000). You can also 
imagine under what scenario the war in the Persian Gulf would 
have been played out if Iraq had had a few primitive nuclear 
munitions at the time. Most probably there would have been no 
war, and the task of liberating Kuwait would have been resolved 
by different means. 
  Few people give much thought to the fact that the category 
of 
terror and the category of "unacceptable damage" in its 
psychological dimension are historical categories -- times 
change, old moral principles and stereotypes are being tightened 
up and new ones are taking shape; attitudes toward the 
permissibility and probability of nuclear war are also being 
reconsidered by the political leaders of the major nuclear 
powers. Throughout postwar history common sense has never yet 
deseted them, which has made it possible at least to avert 
several global nuclear conflicts. There are no grounds for 
supposing that the current U.S. leaders have "frozen" their idea 
of what constitutes acceptable damage for their country as a 
result of an exchange of nuclear strikes with Russia at the 
level imagined by President Eisenhower. When in 1989 the U.S. 
plan for a nuclear attack on the USSR, drawn up in 1957, was 
declassified, environmental specialists were quick to produce a 
model of the consequences for the United States of launching 
such a nuclear strike against the USSR. It turned out that if 
all the planned 180 high-yield atomic and hydrogen bombs were 
exploded on Soviet territory, the USSR would be guaranteed to 
cease to exist as a state, but in two or three weeks the level 
of radioactive fallout on U.S. territory as a result of the 
natural spread of radioactive dust through atmospheric air 
currents would be comparable to 60 Chernobyls. Of course, the 
accuracy of these assessments (from the "greenhouse effect" to 
"nuclear winter") can be disputed, but one would like to hope 
that nobody would try to do a real experiment to check them out. 
  More and more experts today are inclined to think that 
nuclear weapons cannot be used in principle. 
  It is, nevertheless, not possible to wholly agree with this, 
since the unambiguous exclusion of the possibility of the use of 
nuclear weapons removes their deterrent effect. You could even 
use sophistry to prove the opposite. But in practice the basis 
of deterrence is the probability of the use of nuclear weapons. 
References to the irrationality of their use and their terrible 
consequences, which make it impossible to achieve the political 
aims of a war, are convincing but leave room for doubt. For 
instance, in August 1914, when World War I was already building 
up a head of steam in Europe, certain U.S. newspapers thought it 
appropriate to state something to the effect that the systems 
(primarily artillery systems) in the sides' arsenals were so 
destructive that it was difficult even to imagine the 
consequences of a war -- and therefore there could simply not be 
a war. Another example is that Indian tradition has it that the 
events described in the heroic epic "The Mahabharata" (compiled 
in its present form around the middle of the first millennium) 
relate to some wars and great social upheavals of the fourth 
millennium BC. The epic describes various types of what we 
would now call mass destruction weapons, whose use required a 
difficult psychological barrier to be overcome. R. Oppenheimer, 
one of the developers of the atomic bomb, directly associated 
the Mahabharata's "light brighter than a thousand suns" with a 
nuclear explosion. For us it is not so important which modern 
arms systems might correlate to the types of weapons described 
there. What is important was something else -- there was an 
entire science behind their use (star-gazing and their own 
system of combat using "divine weapons"). "No man should ever 
think of warring with them. Should they fall into the hands of 
the weak, they could consume this entire transient world. They 
should always be used as a defense against other weapons. They 
are wonderful, they cannot be parried, but they can repulse an 
attack in which any other weapon is used [divnoye, ono 
neotvratimo, no udar vsyakim drugim oruzhiyem ono otbivayet]." 
The psychological barrier was nonetheless overcome, and the 
weapons were used, despite the warning that some types of them 
would lead to an effect, seen in a modern reading, on the human 
genetic code. We can only hope that the current system of 
deterrence will prove more effective. 
  Unlike the United States, an effective strategic nuclear 
forces structure for Russia which would guarantee the nuclear 
deterrence of any aggressor in any strategic situations, is a 
triad: Strategic Missile Forces plus Naval strategic nuclear 
forces plus Air Force strategic nuclear forces. Excluding the 
Strategic Missile Forces, the Naval strategic nuclear forces or 
the Air Force strategic nuclear forces from the triadic 
structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces would lead, 
according to certain calculations, to an increase in the number 
of nuclear munitions required for deterrence within the 
strategic nuclear forces by a factor of 1.2-1.6, and in 
individual strategic situations, to the nonfulfill of the combat 
mission. This discrepancy in the rational structures whereby 
the Russian and the U.S. strategic nuclear forces are composed 
is attributable to the inferior survivability of the naval 
component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (see V. 
Belousov's article) as compared with the analogous parameters of 
the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. This deficiency in the 
Russian naval strategic nuclear forces may be compensated for 
and is compensated for by a Strategic Missile Forces land-based 
stationary and also road-mobile force. The triadic structure of 
the Russian strategic nuclear forces provides a guaranteed 
counter to technological breakthroughs in the military sphere, 
for example in air defense, ABM defense, or antisubmarine 
defense. Such a strategic nuclear force structure creates a 
great deal of uncertainty for a possible aggressor as to the 
effectiveness of his preemptive strike, and is a factor which 
stabilizes the strategic equilibrium. Therefore it is 
impermissible to remove one of the components from the Russian 
strategic nuclear forces.

  [Text] Nalchik June 15 TASS -- A system protecting shelters 
and homes against radioactive fallout has been invented and 
tested at a special testing range by Kuzer Varukov, a scientist 
working at the university in Nalchik, the capital of 
Kabardino-Balkaria (Russian autonomy). 
  A republican commission concluded that "the inventor proved 
in practice the possibility of making apartments and industrial 
premises impervious to radiation and providing effective 
collective protection to urban and rural residents at a lower 
cost." 
  The invention can be used in the clear-up operations after 
accidents at nuclear power plants and other enterprises which 
deal with radioactive and toxic substances. It has been found 
effective by specialists of the Russian nuclear power ministry. 
In their opinion, it allows to localize emission of harmful 
radiation and substances for the duration of work aimed at 
preventing discharge of nuclides in the environment.

  [Text] Baku, June 13 (TURAN) -- "The Gabala Radio-Locator 
station remains under Russia's jurisdiction and it will be used 
within the framework of the CIS Collective Security Pact," said 
the head of Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, Azad Alizade [name 
and title as received], to TURAN. 
  On June 11, Pavel Grachev and President Aliyev concluded a 
preliminary agreement on this matter. "A principal agreement 
will be worked out by specialists of both countries and after 
that a final document will be signed," said Alizade. The same 
source said that the staff of employees of that station will 
include Russian military personnel and a few Azeri soldiers. 
  Another source from Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry told TURAN 
that Russia will use the radio-locator station free of charge 
and in exchange, Moscow has allegedly promised to "make other 
concessions to Azerbaijan in military affairs." 
  The Gabala radio-station was built in 1982-84 and it is the 
most powerful station in the south of the former USSR. It is 
used to observe the launching of ballistic missiles.

  [Text] Our reporter has learned that the Belarusian 
Embassy addressed the U.S. National Defense Council on 31 May 
requesting confirmation that U.S. strategic missiles are no 
longer aimed at Belarus. The request was prompted by the fact 
that the U.S.-Russian declaration of 14 January 1994 confirmed 
the intention of the presidents of the two states to discontinue 
aiming their strategic missiles by 30 May 1994. The State 
Department confirmed to the embassy that the aiming of all U.S. 
strategic missiles had been discontinued, including those aimed 
at Belarus, from whose territory Russian strategic missiles are 
currently being withdrawn. Our reporter points out that this is 
an important step toward definite elimination of the traces of 
the cold war.

<F P=106> [From the "Itogi" newscast: Video report by Aleksandr </F>
Gerasimov, identified by caption, on the withdrawal of SS-25 
missiles from Belarus] 
  [Text] [Gerasimov to camera and over video of missile 
transporters] SS-25 missiles have been on alert duty in 
Belorussia [Belarus] for the past three years. The last of nine 
missiles of the Feodosiya Red Banner Order of Suvorov Missile 
Regiment is leaving the country today. 
  The strategic systems leaving for Russia will most probably 
be sent to the Transbaykal region or Nizhniy Tagil. They are 
not subject to the START treaty and will, according to Defense 
Minister Pavel Grachev, continue to serve as the main guarantor 
of Russia's security at least until the turn of the century. 
  In the course of this year four regiments and 36 "Topol" 
[SS-25] missiles are to leave Belorussia. In accordance with 
international agreements, the republic is destined to become a 
nuclear-free state next year. 
  Irrespective of all these goings-on, the nuclear arms will 
remain in full readiness during the entire period in question. 
At the same time, none of the servicemen will ever know where 
the missiles were targeted, or what the yield of their warheads 
was. [video shows officers working in front of consoles] 
  [First officer] Attention! Combat orders received. 
  [Second officer] Understood. Operational mode of apparatus 
changed. 
  [First officer] Personnel to shelter. [Words indistinct] 
complete isolation [words indistinct]. 
  [Second officer] Air alert, air alert! 
  [Gerasimov] Russian officers claim that the redeployment of 
strategic missiles is a completely safe operation. The nuclear 
warheads, removed from the carriers beforehand, are conveyed to 
Russia by means of specially designated trains. The missiles 
themselves are safely camouflaged in specially equipped 
railcars, externally indistiguishable from ordinary refrigerator 
railcars. [video shows transporter on the road, watch tower, 
refrigerator-type railcar with missile inside] 
  As distinct from Ukraine and Kazakhstan -- the other 
post-Soviet nuclear republics -- everything connected with 
ensuring the combat capability of the missile systems is being 
withdrawn from Belorussia. The Minsk authorities are not 
obstructing the Russian military. They will be inheriting the 
garrisons and army accommodations and property whose future is 
yet to be defined. The Belorussian Interior Ministry has its 
eye on the secret launch position facilities. The concrete 
structures surrounded by barbed wire are ideal sites for 
prisons. The Belorussian Army wants the barracks. The 
Chernobyl State Committee would not mind taking over divisional 
areas as rehabilitation centers. But so far none of these 
agencies have funds to maintain these facilities. Army housing 
units could turn into dead zones. Because of their location in 
the forests, far away from populated areas as a rule, they are 
of no interest to the local population. 
  Unemployment will rise sharply in Belorussia with the 
withdrawal of the Russian missile troops. Most of the warrant 
officers and contract servicemen are local inhabitants. The 
crisis-ridden economy will not be able to provide them with jobs. 
  In many rural areas of the republic cash may simply 
disappear. Ninety percent of the money in circulation came from 
the budgets of the Russian units. Nonetheless, the local 
authorities are viewing the army withdrawal calmly. 
  [Vladimir Malets, chairman of Lida City Soviet, identified 
by 
caption] I wouldn't say that the Russian Army created problems 
for the local population, as is sometimes claimed in the press, 
saying that there was friction. In my opinion this is not true. 
Relations were normal. If we had problems, such as forest 
fires, we had their understanding and cooperation. They even 
helped us with things like that. So I think that all this talk 
that we can sigh with relief now that the Russian Army is 
leaving is just words. We have lived normally side by side. 
  [Gerasimov] Serving in Belorussia was always the dream of 
officers in the former Soviet Army -- a mild climate, excellent 
staffing by virtue of its being a border district, and firm 
social guarantees. 
  The Russian military are leaving the republic with 
understandable regret. But leaving nonetheless. Before, the 
army and the people were one. Now it is the army and politics.

<F P=106> [Yuliya Khaytina article: "For Each Enemy--One `Topol.' </F>
Missile Regiment on Combat Alert."] 
  [Text] After saying farewell to Belorussia [Belarus], the 
RS-12M mobile intercontinental nuclear missiles, customarily 
called simply "Topols" [poplar trees], along with their support 
systems, have arrived home in Russia--in a division in 
Yoshkar-Ola. Col Vladimir Kashkin's missile regiment, having 
gotten off combat alert duty, was not part of our military 
forces which were serving with the 43d Missile Army in Ukraine 
and which were moved out of there by the sensitive local 
leadership, taking nothing with them: All military property now 
belongs to Ukraine. 
  The system of barriers at the "missile corner" where the 
Topols are located is very inhospitable to those not authorized 
to be there. For example, the so-called electrified zone looks 
like a sort of spiney network, through which at regular 
intervals an approximately 1500-volt current flows. 
  Officers and noncommissioned officers service the Topols. 
This gives them the modest right to call themselves Strategic 
Missile Forces professionals. For good service, an officer with 
the rank of major can earn 300 thousand rubles a month--they get 
money for food, for keeping up appearances, for shift duty, and 
for other good things in life. In view of the fact that most 
men in military service do not have apartments and do not expect 
to have them any time soon, but do have plenty of unemployed 
wives and hungry children, one can say happily that our great 
Motherland's nuclear shield is in the hands of enthusiasts! 
  But fortunately the country is poor and the Defense Ministry 
poorer, while an officer is a sort of father in a subsistence 
economy. He must not only service the missiles, but in his 
"free time"--as if he had any--he must build a barracks, mess 
hall, and so on. Their desperate wives stubbornly work as 
communications officers, dispatchers, and so on, and proudly 
contribute their 150 thousand rubles to the family budget. 
There are 108 of them in Vladimir Kashkin's regiment--almost 
the entire communications and medical staff. 
  Vladislav Zotin, president of the Republic of Mariy El, 
after 
he attended the above-mentioned ceremony, felt so sincerely 
about "his" military men that he thought that the best way to 
prevent bad consequences in the missile forces was to visit 
personally the General Staff in Moscow. He asked for more 
generous financing so that the forces could be at normal 
strength. As to whether the presidential travels will help the 
missile troops--who knows, but his travels have made them feel 
more friendly towards their commanders.

  [Text] Brussels, May 27 (AFP) -- Kazakhstan on Friday [27 
May] became the 19th country to join the Partnership for Peace 
program with NATO, with Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev saying 
it would help contribute to world peace and stability. 
  "This document responds to the interests of our country 
which 
strives for stability," the minister said after signing the 
document. "We do not accept any kind of confrontation or 
conflict." 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation program launched last 
January provides for increased military cooperation between the 
Atlantic Alliance and former Soviet bloc states. 
  In response to reporters' questions, Saudabayev said his 
country, one of four former Soviet states to hold nuclear arms, 
along with Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, would continue sending 
nuclear arms to Russia for dismantling "after some technical 
questions are solved." 
  Kazakhstan up to March had transferred to Russia 12 of a 
total 104 SS-18 nuclear missiles for dismantling under terms of 
the START I Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. 
  At the signing ceremony, NATO Deputy Secretary General 
Sergio 
Balanzino hailed Kazakhstan as a signatory of both the START and 
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying it was a "sign of 
your commitment to the reduction and elimination of nuclear 
weapons on your territory."

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nevelskiy report: "No Need To Beware of Space </F>
Communications"] 
  [Text] St. Petersburg -- A hitherto top-secret 
installation 20 kilometers from Ventspils and owned by the 
Russian Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 
opened its doors Monday to Latvian parliamentarians, the 
scientific public, and journalists. 
  This former military camp, where a handful of specialists 
and 
soldiers remain, is still kept in ideal order. There is no 
spitting or discarding of cigarette butts here. Everything is 
spotlessly clean. And yet the camp is not so small. It is 
located in the depths of the border zone, covering 40 hectares 
of a beautiful pine forest. There are five apartment blocks of 
100 apartments each on its territory, along with a kindergarten, 
school, barracks, large hospital, club, gymnasium, and stadium. 
Add to this a superb garage and filling station and a powerful 
boilerhouse and generator hall with two marine diesel generators 
each producing one megawatt, and you will have some idea of the 
site, whose existence used to be a strict military secret. 
  Its main asset is its unique 32-meter antenna. All around 
the world such giant installations can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. This 1,000-tonne structure designed for space 
communications is one of the most precise and complex of modern 
instruments. It is around this antenna that the fuss has now 
developed. 
  Owing to the hasty Russian troop withdrawal from Latvia our 
country is nursing colossal losses. There are many 
installations on this Baltic republic's territory which cost 
astronomical amounts of money to build and are now having to be 
abandoned. In particular, Latvia has inherited 26 former 
military airfields with ideal concrete runways (four of them are 
the best in Europe) capable of handling all types of aircraft, 
including the heaviest transports. Latvia is simply unable to 
digest everything it has inherited. Real estate, even if left 
unmonitored for a short period of time, becomes easy prey for 
looters. There are now whole gangs of them in the republic who 
rob abandoned military installations. For instance, immediately 
after one flying unit was withdrawn and redeployed to the east, 
the robbers descended on the deserted airfield. When, a couple 
of days later, representatives of the local authorities arrived 
here, they saw a picture that is now typical of Latvia -- stores 
were opened and sealed premises broken into. The raiders took 
everything they could find, including doors and window frames. 
  Obviously, the same fate would be in store for the Ventspils 
installation. But, fortunately for it, events have begun to 
develop to quite a different scenario. 
  When equipment was removed and the question of dismantling 
the antenna arose, the military consulted its developer -- 
Professor Boris Alekseyevich Poperechenko, chief designer at the 
Moscow Power Institute. He flew in and satisfied himself that 
dismantling the dish would be impossible. Did that mean it had 
to be blown up? No, the chief designer could not tolerate the 
idea of destroying his brainchild, which was the embodiment of 
state-of-the-art Russian technology. He suggested a different 
option. 
That was how the news of this unique installation reached the 
Russian Academy of Sciences. And the leaders of the Applied 
Astronomy Institute proposed using it for absolutely peaceful 
purposes. 
  The fact is that this antenna is a superb radio telescope. 
The Russian Academy of Sciences' scientific organizations had 
never dreamed of such modern equipment. The largest telescope 
our radio astronomers have available to them is the 22-meter 
dish in Serpukhov. Consequently, when they need to do serious 
space research, they are forced to appeal to the military and to 
lease free time on their dishes. Understandably, in this 
situation you can only ever do one-time experiments, rather than 
systematic observations. 
  There was one other reason why it was important for the 
Russian Academy of Sciences to get its hands on the Ventspils 
installation. For eight years now the Applied Astronomy 
Institute has been implementing under a government decree the 
"Quasar" project -- a national Russian system of radio 
interferometers to be based on six 32-meter dishes located over 
a huge area from Leningrad Oblast to Kamchatka and from Murmansk 
to the North Caucasus. The greater the distance between the 
dishes, the more accurately the coordinates of stars and quasars 
can be determined and the more reliable the research results 
will be. 
  Project "Quasar" will also make it possible to resolve 
purely 
applied tasks connected with precision cartography, geodesy, the 
study of the country's natural resources, and so forth. But the 
construction of each of its six centers will require billions in 
expenditure and take a long time -- building a counterpart of 
the Ventspils dish will take up to 10 years. That is why the 
scientists are so interested in using it for the needs of 
fundamental and applied science. 
  This sensible and noble idea has met with a response from 
virtually everyone. After visiting Riga in late April a 
government delegation from Moscow signed a protocol envisaging 
joint work between scientists from the two academies of 
sciences, and a fundamental decision was reached to set up a 
Latvian-Russian radio astronmy center. It only remains to sign 
the already prepared draft intergovernmental agreement, but.... 
  "Initially we could not understand what was going on in 
Latvia," Andrey Finkelshteyn, deputy leader of the Russian 
Government delegation and director of the Applied Astronomy 
Institute, said. "All the necessary permits and signatures had 
seemingly been collected, the idea had been approved in 
government circles, and -- nothing happened. Then we realized 
that the Latvian Government is in a more difficult position than 
our own: Every step it takes is monitored by the opposition, if 
it took one step out of line it would be destroyed. 
Consequently, the republic's leaders are afraid that during the 
debate in the Saeima somebody will state that it is not Russian 
scientists who want to come to the Ventspils site, but disguised 
intelligence operatives; that the government has struck a deal 
with the Moscow generals.... And another scandal would break." 
  It was in order to calm things down and reassure the Latvian 
public that such fears are groundless, that the sensational 
"open-door" event was held near Ventspils Monday.

<F P=106> [Article by Col. Gen. Kostyantyn Morozov, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA </F>
military columnist: "We Had and Still Have Security Guarantees 
in Our Hands. The Crimean Tension in Relations With Russia Is a 
Consequence of Ukraine's Nonnuclear and Nonaligned Status"] 
  [Text] From the first days of its existence as a state, 
Ukraine has been resolving the so-called Crimean problem on a 
daily basis. Even before the world felt this, it was already 
known in Ukraine that the Crimean issue would perhaps be a 
decisive one in the political relations between Ukraine and 
Russia. Due to the irresponsible steps taken by the Simferopol 
leadership, which adopted the course toward secession from 
Ukraine and rapprochement with Russia, especially at the 
beginning of May [1994], the world finally perceived a threat to 
peace in Ukraine, and in Europe, in these relations. Ukraine 
must now determine its attitude toward these issues. The 
history of the problem took shape right before our own eyes, and 
everybody remembers it. No matter how bitter one might feel 
about it, our Ukrainian mistakes and indecisiveness are largely 
responsible for the intensification of Russia's influence over 
the Black Sea Fleet and, through it, in Sevastopol and the 
entire peninsula. 
  In January 1992, the fleet commander [Admiral Kasatonov], 
who 
clearly occupied anti-Ukrainian positions, was not removed from 
his post. His presence in Sevastopol made it impossible for 
officers of the fleet to adopt a stand with regard to loyalty to 
Ukraine. Still, by the end of March 1992, the majority of the 
officer corps anticipated Ukraine's governmental decisions 
regarding the subordination to Ukraine's Defense Ministry. 
  Both the Ukrainian president and the government realized 
that 
special conditions for shaping public opinion in Sevastopol (the 
majority of its residents are former sailors and their families 
that arrived there from other Russian fleets; a great number of 
enterprises there depend upon the fleet; there are social 
problems for families of veterans and servicemen) also required 
special approaches, in contrast to the situation with the 
subordination of three military districts in Ukraine. 
  In April 1992, there was yet another attempt to subordinate 
the fleet to Ukraine. However, again, due to its 
indecisiveness, the government did not go beyond the creation of 
a parallel structure (the headquarters of the Naval Forces). 
Unfortunately, the headquarters was immediately discredited and 
its influence upon Black Sea Fleet officers who were supporters 
of Ukraine was insignificant. 
  Fearing complications, Kuchma's government even canceled the 
decisions -- first steps of Ukraine's Ministry of Defense -- in 
the organization of the Black Sea Fleet financing through our 
Naval Forces. However, even then everybody understood that, 
soon, there would be even more problems. That was exactly what 
happened. 
  The unsuccessful provocative officers assembly held in 
Moscow 
at the beginning of 1992 demonstrated that, in Ukraine, the 
majority of officers had made up their minds. That is why 
efforts were concentrated mainly on the fleet. 
  As far back as in May 1992, active work, with the help of 
certain Russian forces, began in the fleet. The work was aimed 
at strengthening anti-Ukrainian sentiment among officers. The 
first step involved a considerable increase in personnel 
salaries. The activity of the officers' assembly resumed and an 
assembly coordination council was created. Active 
politicization of the officers' corps began. The 
intensification of Russia's influence on the Black Sea Fleet 
proceeded "on a legal basis" after signing the Yalta accord 
(August 1992). Since that time, the fleet, subordinated to the 
two presidents, has been taken away from the control of 
Ukraine's Ministry of Defense, and the fleet activity of 
Russia's Ministry of Defense and the main staff of Russia's 
Naval Fleet was practically legalized. 
  Russia, implementing its financial expansion in the Crimea, 
artificially created for itself a priority in providing for the 
fleet. 
  At the same time, assistance to Sevastopol civilians (the 
majority of them are former servicemen) in the creation of 
public organizations and political parties of anti-Ukrainian 
orientation intensified. 
  A combination of intentions on the part of those parties and 
politicized officers over 1992-93 led to an intensification of 
anti-Ukrainian sentiment in Sevastopol and on the peninsula. 
  This situation was repeatedly discussed by a corresponding 
Supreme Council Commission, by the Defense Ministry's board, and 
by Ukraine's Security Council. Unfortunately, the commission 
was incapable of giving a proper evaluation of the events, the 
Defense Ministry's decisions did not find the government's 
support, and the Security Council took into account the position 
of the Crimean leadership. Both Bagrov, then chairman of the 
Crimean Supreme Council, and Yermakov, then presidential 
representative in Sevastopol, did everything to hamper any of 
our initiatives and intimidated the government and President 
Leonid Kravchuk by claiming that "it would lead to an explosion 
in the Crimea." 
That was precisely the reason for the July 1993 decision to 
suspend the formation in Sevastopol of the Ukrainian Armed 
Forces Marines subdivisions. 
  Today, all of this is attributed to the president's 
indecisiveness. I find it necessary to throw light on the 
situation and include everybody. In the majority of cases, the 
president remained unassisted in looking for decisions that 
would not lead to an armed conflict. 
  Such a situation prevailed until the meeting in Massandra: 
The Supreme Council did not adopt decisions, and the government 
(of both Fokin and Kuchma) dealt with no military problems 
whatsoever. In the two years that I held the ministerial post, 
the military issue was discussed only once (in November 1991, 
the legislative bill "On Ukraine's Armed Forces"). 
  Under those conditions, Russia's influence on the Crimean 
problem intensified to the extent that virtually unprecedented 
territorial claimed were made upon Ukraine (the Russian Supreme 
Council decree of 9 July 1993 on the status of the Ukrainian 
city of Sevastopol) and pressure was put on it at the 
negotiations (Massandra, 3 September 1993). 
  We heard a lot about Ukraine's position with regard to the 
presidential elections in the Crimea, but no significant 
decisions have been adopted by Ukraine's Supreme Council nor 
actions by the government. Crimean separatists took advantage 
of the crisis situation in the country and, instead of looking 
for ways to overcome it, started manipulating it. The political 
forces and now also the leadership, artificially creating an 
impression that the Crimean population has the worst standard of 
living and deceiving the people, are, in fact, satisfying their 
own ambitions. 
  More than once I heard about an ethnic source of Ukrainian 
tension. Few people even in Ukraine speak of the political 
aspect of the tension or its artificial nature. In this 
context, the assessment of the situation by chairman of 
Ukraine's Security Service Yevhen Marchuk (KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI 
of 26 May 1994) seems to be not only authentic and patriotic, 
but also timely: "...the whipping up of panic among the 
population, the intimidation of the Crimean leadership, the 
shaping of an enemy image (naturally personified by Kiev), the 
selfless assistance by experts, the commissioning of groups for 
propaganda support, and many other things...." I agree with 
Yevhen Marchuk's conclusion to the effect that all of this will 
have a counter effect, against the Russian plans to split 
Ukraine, and that this force "...will become a consolidating one 
for Ukraine." 
  All of this has been said about our Ukraine -- our own 
fathers' home. External forces are shaking it loose, and we 
must rescue it and not moan that life is bad under these 
conditions. 
  Ukraine is an active participant in the European and world 
political process, which is establishing peace and harmony among 
countries. Many, if not all acts in this process tend to unite 
us with Russia. However, today, neither Ukraine's membership in 
the CIS nor bilateral interstate agreements guarantee security 
for Ukraine. 
  The fact that the program "Partnership for Peace" does not 
unite us with Russia is a serious warning. Russia is seeking a 
priority status in its relations with NATO. The formula "16 
Plus One" suits Russia better. It is clear to everybody that 
this bargaining is not to Ukraine's advantage. Perhaps we are 
expecting guarantees for our security in vain. Or maybe those 
guarantees are still in our hands? 
  Why don't we also do some bargaining, now that Russia does 
not restrict itself by obligations to politically guarantee 
Ukraine's security? If, after the withdrawal of nuclear 
weapons, Ukraine becomes an arena for armed conflicts, maybe it 
is now time to halt the transfer of warheads and adopt a state 
program for political and technical measures to maintain them on 
our own? 
  At any rate, this will strengthen the Ukrainian position at 
the negotiations. 
  It is becoming obvious already that Ukraine's nonaligned 
status does not guarantee its security or noninterference into 
its affairs by other states. We see how Russia is increasingly 
exacerbating the Crimean problem in Ukraine. 
  Perhaps we should revise our striving for nonalignment and 
neutrality? Maybe a declaration of our intentions to gain 
membership of NATO would better guarantee Ukraine's security at 
least in the future? At any rate, it might strengthen our 
position at the negotiations. The United States must be invited 
as an intermediary and an authoritative monitor of the 
fulfillment of the accords. 
  In April 1994, the Ukrainian Academy of Original Ideas 
supported my initiative on the creation of an independent Center 
for Strategic Studies of Military and Political Problems in the 
National and Regional Security. On 28 May, the Ukrainian World 
Coordination Council, at its meeting, approved the idea and the 
draft concept of the center and thereby okayed the creation of a 
special non-governmental fund. 
  I believe that the issues raised by me urgently require an 
independent investigation. The conclusions of such a 
investigation, in the case of the creation of the center at an 
advisory level, might be used by state structures for promoting 
Ukraine's interests. 
  The Russian Federation is our geopolitical neighbor, an 
ethnic homeland to large numbers of our citizens, and our 
potential genuine friend and brother. It is our strong desire 
that it be realized by it that not only Ukraine, but also Russia 
are "doomed" to maintain and strengthen this friendship by all 
possible means. Once again referring to the chairman of 
Ukraine's Security Service, I want to support his important 
conclusion: "There will be no split of Ukraine. We are not the 
Caucasus or Yugoslavia."

<F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondents Viktor Demydenko and </F>
Mykhaylo Melnyk: "Ukraine Is Fulfilling Its Obligations on 
Withdrawing Nuclear Weapons"] 
  [Text] The process of dismantling and transfering 
[nuclear] warheads from Ukraine to Russia is under full control 
and is in conformity with the schedule. As of today [14 May], 
180 warheads have already been transferred to the Russian 
Federation. This was stated today [14 May] by Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk during the opening of the Kiev Spring 
Fair. 
  "It is no secret for anyone that the nuclear missiles 
deployed on the territory of Ukraine are not controlled by it, 
since the nuclear `button' is in Moscow. Besides, Ukraine has 
never even tried to possess such formidable weapons," continued 
the president. He confirmed Ukraine's intention to fulfill in 
full the "tripartite agreement" signed, at the beginning of this 
year, by the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United 
States. 
  "When we signed the agreement, we hoped that other nuclear 
countries would follow suit and would start disarming," 
continued Leonid Kravchuk. "Today, I have information that, in 
fulfillment of the accords reached during the Moscow meeting, 
the United States, too, intends to destroy, on a very large 
scale, its nuclear arsenals," stated the head of the Ukrainian 
state. 
  According to him, by the end of May, all U.S. missiles aimed 
at Ukraine will be recoded. "Therefore, time is coming when our 
states actually proceed from words about friendship and 
cooperation to concrete deeds," emphasized Leonid Kravchuk.

  [Text] Ukrainian MPs who are members of the country's 
Officers' Union will insist that Ukraine stay nuclear if the 
Crimean parliament does not align the Crimean legislation with 
the Ukrainian laws. Vyacheslav Belous, the union chairman, made 
this statement in Kiev Wednesday. 
  Kiev wants Crimea to rescind the original wording of its May 
6, 1992 Constitution that calls for a treaty-based relationships 
between Crimea and Ukraine and enables the Crimean residents to 
have dual citizenship. 
  Belous said that his organization would support Leonid 
Kravchuk in the June 26 elections. 
  The Officers' Union, he said, opposes the attempts that 
anti-state forces inside and outside the Supreme Soviet mount to 
eliminate or disable the presidency in Ukraine. It regards the 
president as the guarantor of the country's unity and 
independence. 
  The Ukrainian Officers' Union has a membership of about 
10,000.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev and Vitaly Trubetskoy] 
  [Text] The issue of Ukraine joining the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty is not of great urgency, believes one of the closest 
advisers of President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  "At present the Ukrainian parliament must first of all 
consider economic issues," leader of the presidential service on 
foreign policy Anton Buteiko declared in his interview with the 
agency Interfax-Ukraine Thursday. 
  In his opinion, "Kiev fulfills the treaty's demands striving 
for a non-nuclear status" without joining the NPT Treaty. 
  On June 1 Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk submitted a 
draft decree on Ukraine joining the NPT Treat to the parliament 
for consideration. According to the project, "presence of 
nuclear weapons on the Ukrainian territory till its complete 
destruction does not contradict the Treaty." 
  In addition, Kiev intends to view "the violation of the 
territorial integrity and inviolability of its border on the 
part of any nuclear state" as a violation of the NPT 
[Non-Proliferation] Treaty. 
  Kravchuk is once more addressing the parliament with a 
proposal to join the treaty. On February 3 this year Ukraine's 
parliament expressed its intention to consider this problem in 
the future.

  [Text] By 30 May, U.S. strategic and ballistic missiles 
will no longer be targeted at Ukraine. As a reminder, this 
decision was reached at the Ukrainian-U.S. negotiations in 
Washington on 11-14 May 1994. In those days, the Ukrainian 
Government delegation headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy 
Shmarov discussed with the American side a wide range of issues 
related to nonproliferation of missile systems carrying mass 
destruction weapons, development of the trilateral process in 
the sphere of nuclear disarmament, and mutual cooperation in 
rocket and space industry, etc. Our correspondent, Viktor Bak, 
interviewed Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov. 
  [Begin recording] [Bak] During your visit to the United 
States, the delegation that you headed also discussed the issue 
of cooperation in the sphere of conversion. 
  [Shmarov] You know that the Ukrainian Government and the 
U.S. 
Administration set up a joint conversion commission. On the 
American side, it is headed by U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry, and on the Ukrainian side, by Machine Building Minister 
Chernenko. This commission has been quite busy (?since last 
fall). The commission has pinpointed about 30 projects. We 
examined those projects together with the United States. At 
present, interested partners are being sought. What are these 
partners for? First, the United States does not have sufficient 
funds to finance this program -- a small amount was earmarked 
for the conversion. We seek to attract the private capital of 
American entrepreneurs and companies. In practical terms, 
selection of partners and signing of projects will probably be 
carried out in July. We have determined the terms for one pilot 
project, which is a joint venture of the well-known U.S. company 
Westinghouse and Ukraine's Hartron. Hartron is an enterprise 
that was oriented toward developing rocket industry products, 
currently subject to the conversion plan. So, we envision that 
it would be engaged in developing safety and control systems for 
nuclear power plants. As you know, this is a major problem for 
us today. This project has been signed. The U.S. Government 
allocated $5 million for this project, while Westinghouse 
designated $20 million [words indistinct], and we offer our 
production and scientific resources. I think that this project 
will assume realistic [word indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- Lt. Gen. Lev 
Ihnatenko, chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces' armaments staff, 
told a briefing for journalists on 18 May that, in compliance 
with accords on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from the 
territory of Ukraine, it is planned to send 200 nuclear warheads 
to Russia this year. Thus far, he said, 180 nuclear warheads 
have already been removed. As for the future destiny of 
strategic bombers, with 42 heavy bomber aircraft remaining on 
the territory of Ukraine -- 19 Tu-160's and 23 Tu-95M's -- the 
lieutenant general stressed that in exchange for the transfer of 
these aircraft to Russia, Ukraine would like to be able to have 
other aircraft of the Ukrainian Armed Forces technically 
maintained and spare parts supplied for various weapons systems. 
A settlement of this issue by the Russian side is forthcoming. 
  Lev Ihnatenko also noted that although only 25 percent of 
the 
research and development institutions's requirements have been 
met, work on the creation of up-to-date armaments systems, 
including precision weapons, is continuing.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jacques Baumel Puts His Foot Down"] </F>
  [Text] In line with his credo, the Gaullist Jacques Baumel 
has decided to put his foot down. The RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] deputy chairman of the parliamentary defense committee 
on Saturday tabled an amendment to the bill for the military 
programming law for the period 1995-2000, stressing the need to 
resume nuclear testing. 
  During a televised interview on 10 May, Francois Mitterrand 
nonetheless said with regard to the resumption of nuclear 
testing: "Where such a serious issue is concerned, if Parliament 
or the government were to significantly disagree with me, I 
would ask the people to decide." The head of state did not 
specify whether this call to the people would come in the form 
of a referendum or if he would dissolve the National Assembly. 
  Jacques Baumel's amendment mentions the need for a 
"resumption of nuclear testing" to acquire the means of 
simulating tests. Before coming up for general debate, the 
amendment is to be examined this morning by the defense 
committee. The deputy explained: "I am trying to clear up the 
skillfully maintained confusion according to which a simulation 
device" such as the PALEN (Preparation of a Limitation of 
Nuclear Testing) system can be acquired "without testing." He 
recognized that no experiments could be carried out before the 
end of Francois Mitterrand's term of office. Jacques Baumel 
stressed that this delay "does not, however, mean that tests 
should not be planned for a later stage in order to preserve the 
future," and he reiterated that the planning law covered six 
years.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Viola Herms Drath: "A Matter of Survival"] </F>
  [Text] President Bill Clinton's foreign policy continues 
to be somewhat vague. The non-proliferation of nuclear mass 
destruction weapons, which Washington has put at the center of 
its foreign policy, is increasingly ill-fated. The failed 
attempt to make North Korea rejoin the NPT [Non-Proliferation 
Treaty] and to include India and Pakistan in a regional 
conference emphasizes the lack of concept that the current 
disarmament policy suffers from. 
  This was expressed, amongst others, by India's Prime 
Minister 
Rao during his visit to Washington, when he criticized that 
moral leadership is claimed by those who demand from others what 
they themselves are not prepared to do. 
  Although the U.S. Administration is calling on the nuclear 
have-nots to join a discriminating non-proliferation regime, it 
is by no means planning to scrap the United States' nuclear 
weapons altogether. The Geneva UN Disarmament Conference may be 
seeing preliminary talks on the renunciation of the use of 
nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states; however, talks on 
extending the nuclear deterrent in the sense of Klaus Kinkel's 
non-proliferation policy failed because the nuclear states 
rejected an expansion of multilateral defense obligations. 
  Bilateral talks are no longer about arms testing but "only" 
about deploying operative arms systems. Clinton's advisers know 
very well that a nuclear condominium in South Asia and the Far 
East makes non-proliferation more difficult. However, sobered 
by the experience in Bosnia, Somalia, and Haiti, the Pentagon is 
preparing a counter proliferation initiative -- although 
modestly funded at a mere $450 million -- in case the 
non-proliferation talks fail. Just as Reagan's Strategic 
Defense Initiative was to protect the United States from a 
strategic first blow, Clinton's program of Counter Proliferation 
is taking a unilateral course of its own. According to a few 
critical voices in the U.S. Congress, this could lead to an 
unpredictable nuclear race, as a result of which the world would 
face more than the 15 states that are known as possessing 
nuclear weapons today. 
  The annual meeting of the UN Disarmament Commission in New 
York was aiming at a clear signal toward an unconditional and 
unlimited extension of the NPT in April 1995. But instead, 
reaching a consensus was prevented because there was no clear 
definition of the objectives of disarmament. This gives rise to 
the question whether the current non proliferation regime is fit 
to survive. Although the nuclear states basically share the 
view of non-nuclear states that non-proliferation is inseparably 
linked with nuclear disarmament, the codifying of an 
international agreement to eliminate nuclear weapons arsenals, 
which has been demanded by several states, and the direct 
coupling to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons still fail to 
take place.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Bonn Secrets"] </F>
  [Text] The FRG Government refuses to report the number of 
German missiles to the arms register of the United Nations. The 
latest report contains information on the purchase of 30 "Mars" 
rocket launchers and the 6,180 missiles belonging to them (with 
a range of 38 km) that were procured by the Bundeswehr last 
year. But the total number of systems and missiles of this 
series and other types is missing. However, the United States 
and Great Britain do not shrink from listing their considerable 
arsenals (120,331 and 32,853 units respectively). The Mars 
systems, which are jointly produced with Germany, are also 
contained. In contrast to 1992, Bonn also did not report 40 
guided AA-10 missiles from GDR [German Democratic Republic] 
arsenals this time. The Defense Ministry supports the 
mystery-mongering with the statement that "this data must not be 
conveyed to the United Nations because a relevant secrecy 
agreement does not exist." The arms register, for whose 
establishment the FRG also pressed in 1991, is to provide a 
survey of international arms arsenals and arms exports.

<F P=106> [Article by Peng Dejian [1756 1795 1696]: "Instrument for </F>
Measuring Atmospheric Coherence Length and Isoplanatic Angle"] 
  [Summary] An atmospheric coherence length 
measurer/isoplanatic goniometer was recently built by a CAS 
Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics (AIOFM) group led 
by Research Fellow Song Zhengfang [1345 2973 2455]. This 
instrument, developed as an "863-3O8" State High-Tech Plan 
(Information Expert Topical Area) project, will provide a key 
new measurement and monitoring means for atmospheric 
comprehensive peace [i.e. nuclear test-ban] monitoring. 
Compared to the differential satellite imagery moving 
monitoring (DIMM) instrument developed by the European Southern 
Observatory (ESO), the Chinese instrument meets late-8O's 
international standards. The instrument is designed to measure 
atmospheric coherence length r by a double-optical-path 
satellite imagery moving differential method and to measure 
isoplanatic angle theta by a satellite light scintillation 
method. The prototype AIOFM instrument, completed in July 1992 
and incorporating advanced technologies such as CCD detectors 
and real-time computerized data processing, has been in trial 
use at the Yunnan Observatory. Scientists there obtained over 
2000 sets of data (measurements of r and theta) on 20 different 
nights. Recently, measurements of r and theta via integration 
of Cn(h) data obtained by a temperature ripple sonde were taken 
in Hefei simultaneously with measurements taken in Yunnan via 
the new method: the average values of the two sets of data 
differed by only 7 percent.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 10 KYODO -- Japan protested to China on 
Friday [10 June] against its underground nuclear test earlier in 
the day and warned it could adversely affect Tokyo's economic 
assistance, now being detailed, Foreign Ministry officials said. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Jiro Saito called Chinese Ambassador 
to 
Tokyo Xu Dunxin to his office and "strongly" protested the test, 
officials said. 
  Saito told Xu that Japan, the world's only country to have 
suffered atomic bombings, has especially strong feelings against 
nuclear testing and called on China not to repeat such tests in 
the interest of bilateral relations, the officials said. 
  Another senior ministry official took similar action in a 
separate meeting with a Chinese embassy minister, voicing 
concern that such a test would have an undesirable effect on 
Tokyo's effort to win understanding and support of the Japanese 
people toward economic assistance for China, they said. 
  It was an indirect reference to Japan's fourth package of 
yen 
credits pledged to China. The two countries are currently 
identifying projects to be financed by the loans. 
  Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa will also urge 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen during their meeting in 
Beijing on Sunday to refrain from nuclear tests, the officials 
said. 
  Earlier Friday, ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a 
statement in which he called the Chinese test "extremely 
regrettable."

  [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- China has staged another 
underground nuclear test despite repeated appeals on the part of 
several states, including Russia, a representative of the 
Russian Foreign Ministry said here today. 
  "This event provokes deep Russian regret, the more so China 
did it at a time of the Geneva multilateral negotiations on 
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, which has been supported by 
all nuclear powers," says the statement received by ITAR-TASS. 
  "We are also alarmed with the fact further Chinese nuclear 
tests may endanger the observation of the nuclear tests 
moratorium by other nuclear powers." 
  "We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand 
its genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the 
international community and together with other nations help to 
achieve complete termination of underground nuclear tests and 
fulfilment of the Chinese-declared intention to conclude a 
treaty on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," says the document.

<F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Juridical Sciences Vladimir Trofimov </F>
under "Arms" rubric: "Chemical Weapons--The Past Without a 
Future?: The International Concept Is Not Yet Capable of 
Answering This Question"] 
  [Text] At the initiative of the Committee for International 
Affairs, hearings were held in the State Duma on the problem of 
the possible participation of Russia in international agreements 
on the disposal of chemical weapons. They were certainly 
particularly remarkable in that they put into question several 
quite prevalent stereotypes in our society with respect to the 
elimination of chemical weapons. 
  Thus, it can frequently be heard that the adoption in 1993 
of 
the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, 
Production, Stockpiling, and Use of Chemical Weapons [CWC] and 
on their disposal may be viewed as a rather major victory of 
Russian diplomacy. As you know, this convention was personally 
signed by Andrey Kozyrev in January 1993 but has not yet been 
ratified by Russia. 
  The appearances of experts involuntarily gave rise to the 
idea that by definition complete and comprehensive chemical 
disarmament, although desirable, is simply an unattainable 
dream. Indeed, any work in the field of chemistry may lead to 
the development of highly toxic substances and there is no way 
to prohibit this in advance. In principle, the production of 
toxic chemical agents is similar to the manufacture of many 
quite peaceful chemicals. This means that there will always be a 
production base that can be reoriented to military needs. By 
mixing some completely harmless substances whose production also 
cannot be prohibited, a powerful toxic agent arises. This 
principle, as you know, is the basis of binary weapons. 
  All of this was reflected in the convention of 1993--it does 
not directly prohibit binary weapons and removes the laboratory 
production of toxic agents from international control. In other 
words, despite its name, the convention does not include a 
comprehensive prohibition of the production of toxic agents. Of 
course this defect in the convention stems from the very nature 
of chemical weapons. 
  But this agreement also has other special features that are 
more difficult to explain through objective reasons. Under the 
convention, for example, the inspection trips of other countries 
are paid for by the state in whose territory the corresponding 
inspections are carried out. Considering that Russia has the 
largest stocks of chemical weapons in the world, it is not 
difficult to assume that we may simply be subjected to an 
invasion of inspectors. And is all of this supposed to be at our 
own expense? 
  The convention will go into effect when it has been ratified 
by 65 states. Why not 90 and why not 130? After all, the 
elimination of chemical weapons would make sense if most of the 
countries of the world were participating in the convention, 
primarily those 25 that according to American assessments 
already have these weapons or are potentially capable of 
producing them. But, as you know, a quarter of these 25 
countries did not even sign the convention and no one knows how 
many will ratify it. Some Arab states are waivering, referring 
to the fact that Israel does not want to take part in the 
Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty. Italy has some doubts. 
It is worth noting that many of these 25 countries are located 
along the borders of Russia. 
  So how many states really intend to participate in the 
treaty? Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Russian Federation are proposing: "Let Russia be among the 
first to ratify the convention and then its example will induce 
other countries to join it." But are such calculations justified? 
  The convention provides that its participants must introduce 
sanctions against states not participating in it by restricting 
their trade in various chemical materials. It is thereby 
supposed that by establishing a kind of chemical COCOM they can 
be induced to join the convention. This means that Russia 
together with the United States will introduce sanctions against 
some of their neighbors. And if Russia refuses to participate in 
the convention, then it cannot be ruled out that it itself will 
fall victim to such sanctions. Was it worth it to agree to 
include in the convention such double-edged conditions for 
Russia? 
  A new international organization is being established to 
verify the execution of the convention. Russia will duly pay 
about 6 percent of its considerable budget but the convention 
does not give any guarantees that the possessor of the largest 
potential of toxic agents will be included in its governing 
bodies. Why were our diplomats unable to achieve this? 
  The convention provides that all participants must eliminate 
their toxic agents within 10 years after it goes into effect. In 
the event that a threat to national interests can be proven, 
which itself is not a simple matter, this period can be extended 
by another 5 years. Hearings have shown that the United States 
will meet this deadline but if Russia is able to do so it will 
only be through a drastic increase in material expenditures. As 
a result of such haste, moreover, there will be a great increase 
in the risk of accidents with the most severe consequences, 
because the corresponding technologies are still far from being 
well developed. Why were deadlines accepted that are 
problematical for us but correspond with the planned time for 
the disposal of American toxic agents? 
  Repesentatives of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
assert that if Russia refuses to participate in the convention, 
then no one will. But if Russia's role in this question is so 
great, why are they trying to convince us that all of the 
shortcomings enumerated above are the result of a compromise 
without which there would be no convention? Does this mean that 
in the course of the negotiations Russia was able to make 
conditions that other participants in the talks would have to 
consider? In general, all things considered, this is how it was 
until the end of the 1990's [as published]. In any event, until 
this time the Americans thought that there would be no 
convention and were particularly active in carrying out a 
program for the creation of binary weapons. And was it here that 
Russia changed its position? 
  In general, there were many such "whys" in the hearings. It 
was also possible to find out one quite incredible thing. It 
turns out that neither at the moment of our signing the 
convention nor to this date has Russia had a confirmed national 
program for the disposal of its own stocks of toxic agents. This 
means that disposal technologies have not been selected, the 
sites for such disposal have not been determined, deadlines are 
unclear, and there is no coordination with the regions. It is 
also worth mentioning that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the Russian Federation solicited consent "at the top" for the 
signing of the convention, not considering the substantial 
reservations of very important ministries. 
  Under these conditions, how can we take on international 
obligations? And in principle are we capable of meeting them? 
Judging by the opinion of specialists, this is more than 
problematical. 
  Is it possible that all of the plans are already prepared 
and 
that they must merely be confirmed? Nothing of the sort. There 
is not even a single plan in the state program (or concept) but 
two, although they are similar to each other. It is still 
necessary to reach agreement with the regions and as a result 
conditions may be made (most likely fair conditions) that make 
it necessary to choose only particular technologies and to carry 
out a series of complex studies, which in principle may change 
the entire approach to the problem. All of this will take time. 
The necessary legislation is lacking. The main thing is that 
there is no funding and a great deal of it is required. 
  It is interesting to compare the position of Russia with the 
approach of the United States to this convention. There they 
adopted the corresponding national program many years ago, when 
it became clear that the kinds of toxic agents that the 
Americans had were obsolete and the time of their guaranteed 
storage was passing. They appropriated money and determined the 
technologies and disposal sites. At the same time, the United 
States also initiated the elaboration of the mentioned 
convention. Its objectives were defined quite openly and clearly 
in the U.S. Congress: Since we are disposing of our chemical 
weapons, it is necessary to induce the USSR and other countries 
to do the same (the U.S. Embassy was kind enough to provide the 
corresponding materials on this to the Duma). As they say, 
commentary is superfluous here. 
  What is it all about and where did such a strange policy of 
Russia come from? Why were our diplomats so conciliatory in the 
negotiations? Was it only because world public opinion condemns 
chemical weapons? The hearings, of course, did not provide an 
answer to this question. Nevertheless, one can try to offer the 
following partial explanation. The fact is that participation in 
the convention is the basis for demands for the necessary 
financing from the government and Federal Assembly and it is 
also a unique weapon to break down the resistance of the 
regions. The convention will induce acceptance of the state 
program without any particular objections, it may eliminate the 
need to perform an overly detailed national ecological study, 
and will facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws. 
  It is probable that the supporters of Russian participation 
in the convention truly calculated everything correctly. The 
existence of international obligations will doubtless be a major 
stimulus. Moreover the convention may become a means for the 
receipt of endless above-plan financing. Indeed, the United 
States, with stocks of 30 million tonnes of toxic agents 
[corrected to 30,000 tonnes in 10 June NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA], 
initially planned to spend about $2 billion for their disposal. 
Subsequently this figure increased to $5 billion and it is now 
almost $10 billion. And if the technology of incineration is 
rejected, then expenditures will amount to $15 billion. We have 
40 million tonnes [corrected to 40,000 tonnes in 10 June 
NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] of toxic agents. For their disposal, they 
are also asking for a little over $2 billion. Is this figure 
realistic? It is hard to say. The largest share of the 
expenditures will go to construction and a significant share 
will be for operation of the facilities. The prices in Russia 
for construction, complex equipment, and the payment of 
qualified specialists are now approaching world prices and in 
some cases they have already exceeded them. This means that our 
expenditures for the disposal of toxic agents will also be close 
to those of the Americans and may also rise to $15 billion. 
  It seems that a similar situation developed with respect to 
the START-1 treaty. As far as the author knows, the money 
allocated for its realization has already been spent and the 
treaty is far from being completed. But the corresponding 
departments are not concerned, knowing that as much as they ask 
for will be given for the treaty. Of course this is only a 
conjecture but it may be that it is precisely for this reason 
that all of our draft concepts and programs for the disposal of 
chemical weapons are oriented to the 1993 convention rather than 
the question of ratification being oriented to the existence of 
money and the technical means and to public opinion. 
  What should be done now? The Committee for International 
Affairs first of all recommended that in the resolution of 
questions involving the disposal of toxic agents one should 
proceed not so much from the requirements of the 1993 convention 
as from our real and physical possiblities and also that 
consideration be given to precisely Russian public opinion, 
especially in the regions. This certainly suggests that because 
of the lack of adequate financial and physical resources Russia 
will take the course of disposing of its toxic substances at a 
slower pace than was foreseen by the 1993 convention, especially 
since no substantial foreign assistance is expected. Of course 
to do so it will be necessary to overcome a certain amount of 
pressure from countries of the West. 
  It is also important to consider the fact that the risk of 
ecological disasters, which judging by everything cannot be 
ruled out anyway (there are simply no absolutely safe 
technologies at this time, even in the West) will increase 
enormously because of the utilization of undeveloped methods in 
the hasty disposal of chemical weapons. By the way, this 
circumstance caused some deputies to doubt: Are there not some 
people in the West who, in "giving" us their technologies, are 
actually getting an opportunity to work them out on the Russians? 
  Only a small part of the Russian toxic agents need to be 
destroyed rather quickly--about 6,000 tonnes of quite old 
munitions--and this requires the allocation of funds in any 
case. The remaining stocks of toxic agents can be stored for a 
long time yet, spending only about $5 million a year for this. 
  Independent experts stated at the hearings that careful 
checks of many cases showed that the "chemical diseases" of 
local inhabitants are actually the result of the action of 
sometimes unnoticeable but absolutely uncontrolled civilian 
production rather than leaks from military facilities. In the 
course of a year in the country as a whole, the military 
registers just one or two cases of acute contamination and this, 
as a rule, does not happen at facilities for the storage of 
toxic agents. 
  Another matter is the declassification of the sites where 
toxic agents were disposed of during all the years of Soviet 
authority. Here it is indeed probable that people are living in 
dangerous places without even suspecting this. The participants 
in the hearings gave a direct recommendation to carry out such 
declassification. One should also consider the fact that the 
quantity of toxic agents destroyed in the USSR is not so great 
in relative terms. The well-known Vil Mirzayanov speaks of 
400,000 tonnes but it appears that he has exaggerated this 
figure by a factor of four, although he probably did not intend 
to do so. Apparently this data should also be declassified to 
avoid inflaming passions. 
  By the way, the position of Mirzayanov in the hearings is 
worthy of mention in more detail. He understands very well the 
shortcomings of the convention, which were addressed above, and 
states frankly that it "does not correspond to the national 
interests of the Russian Federation" (I quote from the verbatim 
account--V.T.), because it does not prohibit the West from 
continuing the development of the latest types of toxic agents. 
  It is useful also to pay atention to the military aspect of 
the possession of chemical weapons. Of course they are inhumane 
and will effect primarily the civilian population. At the same 
time, however, they are a significant deterrent factor, 
especially in their latest modifications, and it is also by no 
means wise to ignore this circumstance. It is clear that less 
than a dozen saboteurs armed with the latest binary toxic agent 
are capable of delivering such a retaliatory strike against any 
state (against military facilities, of course) and that this 
will certainly take away even the desire to think about carrying 
out "peacemaking" actions such as those in Somalia on the 
territory of Russia. Under conditions of the total collapse of 
our army, the disappearance of a unified air defense system for 
the country, and the unconsidered elimination of nuclear 
weapons, one probably ought to think once again whether or not 
it is right to renounce such an effective and relatively 
inexpensive weapon, especially unilaterally. 
  By the way, it is also worth mentioning that there are 
chemical compounds that do not kill people but are capable of 
paralyzing them temporarily. There are substances that disable 
engines and destroy tires. In connection with the events in the 
Balkans, the United States issued the public reminder that it 
has such possibilities. It is also well known that although the 
United States is demanding that we destroy all of our military 
production, they themselves do not want to do this. There are 
several reasons for this. The American production systems are 
more "flexible" and can easily be reorganized for the execution 
of peaceful tasks. By the way, the reverse transformation is not 
complicated. It will doubtless be interesting to the readers to 
learn that if necessary the United States is capable of 
beginning the industrial production of combat toxic agents, 
including binary, within two (two!) months, performing several 
necessary stages in their outfitting. This would also be useful 
information to the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of the Russian Federation, who at the hearings fiercely 
sought to convince those present that the 1993 convention 
prohibits binary toxic agents precisely because their industrial 
production can be begun only after a number of intermediate 
experimental stages, which are not permitted by the convention. 
  According to a notice from the U.S. Embassy sent to the Duma 
in connection with the hearings, the United States is ceasing 
only those activities that are prohibited by the convention of 
1993. And which ones are not prohibited? The Americans also 
reported that a number of countries are continuing to produce 
not only chemical weapons but are even working on 
bacteriological weapons. It seems that it is worthwhile to give 
thought to this information. After all, we are being told that 
it is a matter of the prohibition of weapons that have become 
outdated. Are they really outdated? 
  In conclusion, it is also interesting to note that not a 
single one of the many agreements in the area of chemical 
disarmament that Russia has signed recently with other countries 
provides for a ratification procedure. And in one of them, for 
example, the Russian side directly promised to become a 
participant in the convention of 1993. So are they trying to 
present the Duma with a fait accompli and deprive it of the 
opportunity to choose? This is not ruled out, for it is not 
permitted to make stipulations in the treaty. 
  For the time being, the deputies of the Duma are 
recommending 
to the president and government at least to maintain the 
personnel and scientific base involved with chemical weapons, 
without which within several years it will not be possible to 
dispose of toxic agents safely with any technologies. And it is 
precisely then that something irreparable may happen.

  The third stage of the Sa'eqeh exercise, which was held to 
renew the fight against drug smugglers, to identify and destroy 
the production and distribution networks of narcotics, and to 
cleanse the areas infected by these substances, has ended 
successfully. Brig Shafi'i, the commander of the office of the 
fight against drugs of the law enforcement forces, announced the 
above on 22 May during an interview and said: During this 
week-long exercise, units of the Law Enforcement Forces 
throughout the country created 1,425 undercover units, cleansed 
982 infected areas, discovered over 3,320 kg of drugs, and 
arrested 2,678 smugglers and distributers of drugs and over 
4,000 addicts. The commander of the office of the fight against 
drugs of the Law Enforcement Forces of the nation spoke of the 
activities of his forces during the past two months, saying:

  [Text] Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres and 
Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares met 
yesterday in San Jose and agreed to join efforts during their 
respective administrations to fight drug trafficking and to 
adopt measures to improve their commercial relations. 
  Perez Balladares traveled to Costa Rica with Foreign 
Minister-designate Gabriel Lewis Galindo on an invitation by 
fellow Social Democrat Jose Maria Figueres, with whom he met for 
about one and one-half hours. 
  In a news conference at the Costa Rican Presidential Palace, 
Figueres and Perez Balladares said they talked about four 
specific issues: bilateral trade, social investments at the 
common border, creation of a mixed-bilateral commercial 
association, and the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  Both presidents agreed the sovereignty of their respective 
nations is violated when they are used by drug traffickers for 
their illicit trade. 
  "We agreed to carry out efforts, in a decisive and 
definitive 
manner, to control drug smuggling as a mutual responsibility," 
Figueres stated. 
  Meanwhile, Perez Balladares said the issue of drug 
trafficking is fundamental. He affirmed that the struggle 
against drug trafficking may result in the creation of liaison 
and joint cooperation offices, not only with the United States, 
but also with all countries that feel the need to cooperate in 
this matter. 
  Figueres' National Liberation Party and Perez Balladares' 
PRD 
[Democratic Revolutionary Party] assisted each other during the 
elections in their respective nations. Both presidents were 
classmates at the University of Notre Dame in the United States. 
  The presidents expressed their interest in building a 
permanent commission formed by the two countries' governments 
and private enterprise to promote economic, social, and 
commercial development along the Costa Rican-Panamanian border.

  [Text] La Paz, 12 May -- Through a Supreme Decree signed by 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and his cabinet, the 
government has approved the "Regulations for the 
Industrialization of the Coca Leaf," in compliance with the 
agreements signed last week by the executive branch with the 
five Federations of Coca Producers of the Chapare region of 
Cochabamba and Yungas, La Paz. 
  This supreme decree, which will take effect once it is 
published in the official gazette, states the following: 
  "Whereas: 
  Article 4 of the Law on the Regulation of Coca and 
Controlled 
Substances No. 1008 defines the legal use and consumption of 
coca, the social and cultural practices of the Bolivian 
population in their traditional manners, such as the "aullico" 
or chewing, medical, and ritual uses; 
  Article 5 of Law No. 1008 defines: "Other forms of legal use 
of the coca leaves that are not harmful to human health nor 
cause any kind of addiction, as well as its industrialization 
for legal uses, will be the object of special regulations;" 
  The Bolivian Government has signed and ratified the 1988 
Vienna Convention, which in Article 14, Clause 2, states that 
the measures to eradicate the illegal cultivation of plants from 
which narcotics are extracted "must respect the basic human 
rights and must take into account the traditional legal uses of 
coca for which there is historical evidence as well as the 
protection of the environment;" 
  It is the government's obligation to regulate the 
industrialization process of coca leaf for medical uses, food, 
and other uses within the framework of current Bolivian and 
international norms; 
  With the purpose of promoting the industrialization of the 
coca leaf and to facilitate the application of Law No. 1008 
according to the definitions of Articles 96 and 133 of the 
Bolivian Constitution and the international conventions on the 
subject; 
  It is hereby decreed: 
  Article 1. The regulations on the industrialization of coca 
leaf, made up of four chapters and 15 articles, and which 
constitute an annex of this Supreme Decree, are hereby approved. 
  Article 2. The regulations approved through this Supreme 
Decree refer to legal coca, not meaning that it is 
decriminalized, and authorizing its industrialization in certain 
volumes from coca leaf extracted from the traditional regions 
listed in Article 9 of Law No. 1008. 
  Article 3. Any product derived from coca leaf must not 
exceed 
an alkaloid content beyond what is established by our laws, 
international conventions, and the World Health Organization. 
  This Supreme Decree must be executed and enforced by the 
ministers of foreign affairs and worship, government, justice, 
finance and economic development, human development, national 
defense, sustainable development and environment, and social 
communication.

  [Text] The president of the five federations [of coca 
growers] of the Cochabamba tropical region has said that 
mobilizations could start at any moment. The coca growers are 
threatening to start blocking highways and stage rallies in 
Cochabamba demanding the abolishment of the supreme decree 
regulating the industrialization of coca leaf. 
  We will now listen to what Jorge Martinez has to say about 
the matter: [begin recording] 
  Martinez: [Words indistinct] to again implement 
measures of pressure to demand the fulfillment of the claims 
made by the whole of Cochabamba because, so far, the government 
has done nothing but sign agreements and hold meetings, while in 
practice it has done nothing. 
  Unidentified reporter: In addition to protest, 
will highways be blockaded? 
  Martinez: There will probably be road blockades 
and protest marches in Cochabamba and the tropical regions. 
[end recording] 
  We wish to announce, moreover, that during our visit to the 
tropical region of Chapare we were able to see for ourselves 
that there is no such militarization of the region; there are no 
troops in the tropical region of Chapare, as has been reported. 
  This fact has been confirmed by William Condori, leader of 
the coca growers: 
  [Begin recording] In (Villa Catorce) and further inland, in 
the Simon Secure Park, we have confirmed reports that there is 
no type of militarization of the tropical zone in Cochabamba. 
We have also heard government spokesmen talk about the 
possibility of a militarization of the Cochabamba tropical 
region, but so far we have seen no troops. [end recording] 
  As you have just heard, there are no troops in the tropical 
Chapare region. 
  Condori also said there are no narco-guerrillas in the zone, 
and that it would be good for a special commission to enter the 
region to investigate reports of the alleged existence of 
narco-guerrillas.

  [Text] Minister of Government German Quiroga has asserted 
that almost all the coca produced in Chapare goes for drug 
trafficking and does not deserve executive branch support to 
legalize it. 
  Quiroga thus dismissed any possibility that the Decree on 
the 
Industrialization of Coca will be modified. This decree bans 
the industrialization of coca produced in Chapare, Cochabamba. 
  The minister asserted: "It seems some coca producers want to 
legalize it but the government is not planning to do so because 
everyone in Bolivia knows that 80 or 90 percent of the coca 
produced in Chapare is surplus to requirements." 
  He said that the surplus production is earmarked exclusively 
for drug trafficking. To think of legalizing it would mean 
"legalizing the raw material for the production of drugs." 
  Quiroga said there is no chance of this happening because it 
would go against the drug enforcement policy. 
  He explained that the controversial supreme decree and its 
regulations on the industrialization of coca complies with 
current Bolivian laws and international agreements. As such the 
criticisms it has prompted are unjustified. 
  Quiroga believes "in Bolivia there is good coca and bad 
coca. 
The good coca deserve the support of all organization for its 
industrialization so that it may be marketed properly." 
  He added: "The bad coca does not deserve any support because 
it is earmarked for drug trafficking." 
  He said government authorities believe some leaders want the 
bad or surplus coca production to circulate freely in the 
country. This is not possible because by allowing this the 
government would be promoting drug trafficking. 
  Quiroga concluded: "If the government yields to pressure 
seeking to legalize coca from areas that produce surplus 
production, it would be violating measures like Law No. 1008 and 
some international agreements. This is not possible and will 
not happen."

  [Text] La Paz, 13 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Deputy Ramiro 
Barrenechea, of the Pachacuti Axis Movement, has said that the 
supreme decree authorizing the industrialization of coca leaves 
is further evidence of the government's inopportune actions, as 
it breaks all existing laws by penalizing the use of this 
product. 
  He added critically that "this decree proves that the only 
thing the government wanted in the negotiations (with the COB 
[Bolivian Labor Federation]) was to delay the resolution of this 
central problem. It is a deliberate lie, because when the 
lifting of the highway blockade was conditioned on the issuance 
of the decree, it was said that the text of the decree would be 
the one that was drawn up with the peasants, who honestly and 
loyally lifted the blockade. The peasants believed the 
government's word, but the government has now done exactly the 
opposite." 
  He went on to say that this decree penalizes coca leaves and 
goes far beyond Law 1008, because while this law made no 
provisions on the subject, such provisions have now been made. 
We can see that the agreement that was reached with the 
peasants was ignored, based on a decision by the U.S. Embassy 
which said that it would not permit implementation of a 
different policy for coca, and this is what we are now seeing. 
  He said that "this is an unbelievable provocation, because 
the government could have said this before. Instead, it has 
deceived peasants with a decree that despite enforcing the 
regulations that were agreed upon, has also penalized coca." 
  To justify his assertion, Barrenechea mentioned Article 2 of 
the decree, which reads: "The regulations approved by this 
decree apply to legal coca, and do not entail the legalization 
of coca. Specific quantities of coca leaves should be 
industrialized in the traditional zones that are described in 
Article 9 of Law 1008." 
  The government should have been more sincere, and should 
have 
said that it did not need to debate with peasants, as there is 
an order that must be fulfilled no matter the agreements we may 
have reached, Barrenechea said. 
  He added: "This decree will probably cause a wave of 
unbridled reactions by peasants, because maintaining that a 
government position can be negotiated is very different from 
accepting a proposal, finding consensus on it, and then doing 
exactly the opposite. It is like a hidden dagger carried by 
those who are not sure even of their own program."

  [Text] Coca growers have decided to suspend the 
mobilizations scheduled for this week to protest the 
militarization of coca plantations. 
  Guido Tarqui, leader of the COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] 
Commission for Coca Affairs, has stated that despite the 
militarization of the coca production zones, the coca growers 
are not going to move a finger to make substitutions for or 
reduce their coca plantations. [begin recording] 
  Tarqui: Three important points have been taken 
into account. One of them is that the measures in the 
Cochabamba tropical region, such as the blocking of highways, 
must be implemented because they are in a state of emergency. 
But they have decided that this state of emergency will prevail 
until the end of the COB congress, during which we are going to 
propose declaring a state of emergency in all coca production 
zones. [end recording]

  [Text] La Paz, 20 May (EFE) -- Today Bolivian authorities 
once again contradicted themselves regarding the alleged 
existence of guerrilla groups linked to drug trafficking and the 
entry of Army troops into the main coca leaf production area in 
Bolivia. 
  While Bolivian Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz 
confirmed 
the military presence in Chapare to investigate reports on the 
alleged presence of illegal armed groups linked to drug 
trafficking, Bolivian Interior Minister German Quiroga said: 
"There is no such presence (nor) is Chapare going to become 
militarized." 
  Soliz explained: "A situation that may be the beginning of a 
guerrilla movement has been detected through (Army) 
intelligence. Therefore, military troops must carry out the 
necessary investigations to prevent it." 
  On 17 May, the Army leadership issued a communique 
"categorically" denying press reports on the alleged deployment 
of troops to the Chapare region to "prevent `narco-guerrillas' 
from getting organized." 
  The coca peasant unions rejected the official version, 
stating that the "`narco-guerrilla' is something made up by the 
government to intimidate the region's peasants" and voiced their 
concern over a possible "militarization" of Chapare. 
  The Bolivian interior minister asserted that reports on 
"narco-guerrillas and militarization" in Chapare are 
"smokescreens" with which the peasant leaders intend to "save 
their colleagues who were arrested" after drugs were found in 
their homes. 
  Quiroga held the peasants responsible for the version of the 
surfacing of a guerrilla movement linked to drug traffickers and 
the entry of Army troops in Chapare, where most of the coca 
earmarked for the illegal production of cocaine comes from. 
  On 26 April, Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
warned that in Chapare "there is a climate that could lead the 
drug cartels to a `narco-guerrilla' process." The peasants 
interpreted this warning as an "insult" and reacted by insulting 
the chief of state. 
  According to Quiroga, some coca growers intend to distract 
the peoples' attention from the growing protection they grant 
drug traffickers they supply with illegal coca production. 
  He explained that last weekend, during operations carried 
out 
by drug enforcement forces in Chapare, maceration pits were 
found on the land of coca growers "and, in the specific case of 
a woman leader, we found 20 kg of drugs in her home." 
  Bolivia is the second-largest coca leaf producer in the 
world 
after Peru, and experts believe it has become the second-largest 
country refining drugs in the world after Colombia.

  [Text] La Paz, 19 May (ANF) -- It was officially announced 
that the government has decided to continue the plan to 
eradicate 3,000 hectares of coca this year and thus receive $20 
million in assistance from the United States. 
  National Social Defense Mario Soliz said: "Bolivia urgently 
needs that financial aid to compensate its balance of payments." 
  "The government wants to attain its goals without 
implementing forceful programs, but by convincing each coca 
plantation owner," the government official said. 
  According to official eradication figures, between January 
1993 and April 1994 just 2,500 hectares of coca plantations and 
18,000 square meters of coca nurseries were destroyed. 
  Despite the extraordinary US concession, Bolivia was unable 
to fulfill its goal of eradicating 5,000 hectares of coca and 
20,000 square meters of nurseries by last March. For this 
reason the $20 million disbursement was suspended by the United 
States. 
  The executive branch and the Bolivian ambassador to 
Washington have obtained an extension so as not to lose the aid 
which is "important for the 1994 balance of payments." 
  Meanwhile, the Alternative Development Under Secretariat has 
reported that it continues its program of paying $2,000 for each 
hectare of eradicated coca crops. 
  In turn, the five federations of coca producers have 
declared 
"states of emergency and mobilization in face of an imminent 
militarization of the Chapare region," even though the 
government and the Armed Forces have denied it.

  [Text] In referring to bank secrecy and the tapping of 
telephone conversations, President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
stated in Sucre: 
  Nobody is thinking about lifting the bank secrecy. There is 
no plan to this end, and still less to (violate) the specific 
rights of Bolivian people living in democracy. An authorization 
issued by a prosecutor or a judge is necessary to do this. 
  Speaking about the militarization of the Chapare zone, the 
president said: 
  There is no intention of militarizing the struggle against 
drug trafficking. I was never in favor of that when I was a 
member of the opposition, and still less so now that I am in 
government.

  [Text] La Paz, 26 May (EFE) -- According to the latest 
report issued by the Bolivian company Muller and Associates 
Economic Analysis, Bolivia runs the risk of becoming an 
international "money laundering" center of funds derived from 
drug trafficking. 
  In its latest report on Bolivia entitled "Behavior and 
Assessment of the Banking System," the company states that 
"international drug enforcement organizations are concerned over 
the high dollarization of the Bolivian economy." 
  The report adds that in December 1993, "72 percent of demand 
account deposits, 91 percent of savings deposits, and 91 percent 
of time deposits" in Bolivia are in dollars. 
  It states that "because of the high dollarization of the 
(Bolivian) economy, it is very easy to introduce `coca-dollars' 
into the banking system." 
  Moreover, it states that "money laundering" in Bolivia is 
not 
a crime, and that the Bank Secrecy Law in force does not allow 
drug enforcement organizations to have access to information in 
conducting their investigations. 
  After Peru, Bolivia is the second largest world producer of 
coca leaf, the main staple for cocaine manufacturing; and the 
second largest world cocaine refining center in the world.

  [Text] La Paz, 14 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Within the next 30 
days the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) will broaden its 
area of operations into the Bolivian Amazon region to prevent 
illegal drug trafficking by cutting off the traffickers "supply 
line." 
  This information was confirmed today in La Paz by Social 
Defense Secretary Mario Soliz Valenzuela. 
  Soliz reported the preparation of a "long-term project" for 
immediate implementation. 
  He indicated that the new FELCN regional headquarters will 
probably be located in Cobija (Pando Department) and that the 
plan includes the participation of customs control mechanisms, 
police border posts, and the military units in the region. 
  FELCN Deputy Commander General Rogelio Vargas Ortuno 
reported 
that as a result of increased trafficking activities in some 
sectors of Beni and Pando Departments, a detailed study has been 
made on the creation of a so-called "permanent operational 
command" in this tropical region. 
  Gen. Vargas said the many FELCN intelligence reports on the 
dangerous growth of trafficking in the zone have received the 
appropriate attention of Bolivian officials. 
  He added: "The creation of a regional FELCN headquarters is 
the result of that concern." 
  Vargas said many factors prompted national officials to 
create a permanent control post on the Brazilian border. 
  He cited actions by FELCN agents a few weeks ago after 
settlers of the region opposed the arrest of a dozen traffickers. 
  He said the regional command to be established in Pando will 
be permanent and similar to the ones in Santa Cruz, Trinidad, 
and Cochabamba. 
  The FELCN reported that the busiest drug-routes in the 
Amazon 
region are the Guayaramerin-Riberalta-Serena (Rio Madre de 
Dios), and the Puerto Rico-Cobija (Pando) roads. 
  The report indicates that the roads "frequently help" 
traffickers in the region to consolidate their illegal activity. 
  The report says that these roads serve an area of about 600 
square kilometers. Public transportation vehicles run on them 
and these are widely used by traffickers. The report adds that 
the drugs produced in the zone come mainly from San Joaquin and 
San Ramon (Beni Department).

  [Text] La Paz, 16 May -- The Army General Command reported 
on 16 May that the Armed Forces will carry out "anti-guerrilla 
training exercises" in the tropical areas of Cochabamba and 
throughout the country. 
  Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga told LOS 
TIEMPOS in La Paz that "anti-subversive" logistic operations are 
being carried out by diverse military units in the region. They 
follow an "activities schedule" drafted by the Armed Forces 
Third Department. 
  Gen. Caceres said that at no time has his command ordered or 
instructed the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba "to 
move military contingents" to Chapare, Ichoa, or Chimore to 
carry out an "alleged intelligence dragnet to investigate the 
existence of armed groups in the zone." 
  Caceres said remarks by General Guido Tavera Leyton, 
commander of the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba, were 
"misinterpreted" as a result of "superficial evaluations" on 
regular Armed Forces "antisubversive" operations. 
  Caceres said: "All military movements in Cochabamba's 
tropical region over the next few days are within the framework 
of routine maneuvers scheduled by regiments and military units 
based in the region." 
  Caceres added, however, that Gen. Tavera Leyton's remarks in 
Cochabamba will be "thoroughly investigated" to definitively 
establish what happened to the military announcements that were 
released to the press the past weekend. 
  The military chief said that military activities in the zone 
merely seek to consolidate education, health, and basic 
sanitation projects in rural areas. 
  "Those projects in no way seek to fight insurgent outbreaks 
in the zone. As far as the Army knows they do not exist, for 
there are only indications of that possibility," Caceres said. 
  Last weekend the commander of the Seventh Army Division 
based 
in Cochabamba told the press that Army intelligence agents were 
"moved" to the Chapare region to investigate the possible 
presence of irregular groups linked with drug traffickers. 
  Tavera Leyton also announced that a report will be released 
in the next few hours to inform the population whether there is 
evidence of subversive activities in Chapare, Chimore, and Ichoa. 
  The military chief said that in June the Army will organize 
an "active" operation of all military units in the Chapare 
region to receive anti-guerrilla training. 
  Gen. Tavera said that the Rene Barrientos Ortuno Regiment 
based in the Colomi settlement and the Captain Victor Ustarez 
Regiment based in Tolata will participate in the anti-guerrilla 
military exercises that will be carried out as a priority in the 
Chimore and Ichoa area. 
  Tavera also ruled out the possibility of declaring 
Cochabamba's Chapare region a "military zone" as a result of 
"the growing" drug trafficking activity in this coca region.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The New </F>
Target of Traffickers"; passages within slantlines published in 
italics] 
  [Text] There is a new color in the uniforms of Rio de 
Janeiro drug traffickers: olive green. Although the information 
has not yet been confirmed, the precise details that have been 
supplied do not permit many doubts to be entertained. In Santa 
Cruz, the Conjunto Antares drug traffickers' boss has for months 
dressed his men in Army uniforms! Two members of the gang led 
by the trafficker--who "works" under the curious alias of 
/Soldier/--were arrested by the Drug Control Precinct (DRE), and 
revealed that the uniforms are obtained from recruits serving in 
Western Zone barracks. /Soldado/ does not buy them; he barters 
them for drugs. The recruits are not only addicts. According 
to /a former drug spot manager/--an important post within drug 
trafficking hierarchy--they receive "a larger amount of drugs" 
for each stolen uniform in order to open a market in a 
privileged sector: the barracks! 
  This information is serious, but not because it deals with a 
bold attack against the Army. After all, how long have 
newspapers been reporting successive arms robberies from Army 
barracks? This has happened not only in Rio de Janeiro and--to 
tell the truth--not only in the Army, because the Navy and the 
Air Force have also been victims of that crime. It would be 
enough to know the caliber of the arms that the police have 
seized from drug traffickers' arsenals to identify the link 
between the broad availability of heavy weapons, which are for 
exclusive military use, and drug trafficking. The problem 
consists in the new step forward: the possession of uniforms. 
  The fact that drug traffickers steal uniforms that are used 
by Brazilians who are serving in the national Army has obvious 
significance: It is, as such, so serious that no additional 
observation is necessary. Aside from the worrisome implications 
of traffickers dressing in uniform, what is the objective of 
bartering military uniforms for drugs? To have available an 
"assortment" that can open any door? Or, on the next fight with 
the PM [Military Police] or the Civil Police, make traffickers 
appear as Army members, creating an institutional crisis? 
  Those who hurriedly proclaim that "the Army on the streets" 
is the only solution for the state of calamity in Rio de 
Janeiro, should reflect a bit on the reason why traffickers want 
to have military uniforms. The Conjunto Antares /soldiers/ have 
confirmed the possibility for drug trafficking to enter the 
barracks. This is why it is necessary to pay attention to one 
fact: The longer the Army remains in direct contact--through 
repression--with the world of drugs, the longer Army 
soldiers--the true soldiers--will be exposed to a dangerous 
coexistence. Those who always imagine that the worst will 
happen should carefully reflect on the robbery of uniforms. The 
vulnerability of the forces of law might be at stake. That is 
why it is important to find out, as soon as possible, the reason 
why drug trafficking has chosen this target. 
  Those who imagine that the price of cocaine is the main 
antidote against /contamination/ of the troops should recall the 
results of a poll made in September by the Rio de Janeiro State 
Drug Control Council. According to this poll, 28 percent of the 
addicts who tried to obtain some help to end their addiction 
earn a minimum salary, while 56 percent of cocaine consumers 
live in the northern Rio de Janeiro zone! The poll's conclusion 
deserves attention: Drugs have reached sectors that do not have 
enough money to buy meat. 
  Drug traffickers have an organization that observes methods 
and adopts efficiency techniques. In July, in the Tijuca 
forest, DRE agents clashed with drug traffickers in a battle in 
which the latter used authentic guerrilla warfare methods. In 
the Roquete Pinto ghetto, the troops that protected the area 
after shots were fired on a recruit of the Ramos 1st Infantry 
Battalion found a surprising copy of their methods. For the 
time being, stolen uniforms are only a "passport" to a 
concentrated, well located market. They hint, however, at 
another type of use that is hard to identify by common sense. 
Yet common sense advises that if the worst is to be avoided, 
the Army should keep away from drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report by Darcy Quinn from the "24 Hours" </F>
newscast--passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] The conflict between the Constitutional Court and 
President Gaviria has intensified. On the evening of 23 May, 
the president of the court disclosed a letter suggesting the 
dangers of a presidential dictatorship. Darcy Quinn has this 
report: 
  Quinn: Constitutional Court President Jorge Arango 
began his reply to President Gaviria by reminding him of certain 
basic provisions contained in the Constitution. 
  Arango: "The Constitution recognizes the 
separation of state branches--namely, the legislative, 
executive, and judicial branches--under Article 103." 
  He also told the president that he has overlooked one very 
important point: Common citizens are permitted to do anything 
that is not specifically prohibited by law, but public servants 
must limit their actions to the duties outlined by laws and 
regulations. 
  Arango: "With due respect for his very important 
office, we must point out that the president of the Republic is 
not a common citizen and that there are limits on his ability to 
exercise power." 
  He reminded President Gaviria that the duty of the 
Constitutional Court is to decide whether rules and regulations 
are in keeping with the Constitution. 
  Arango: "In terms of reviewing laws, for example, 
this responsibility obviously cannot be fulfilled by Congress, 
which issues them. The chief executive cannot do this either, 
because this would imply a dictatorship." 
  Finally, the Constitutional Court president outlined which 
branch of state would serve to pass judgment over members of the 
court. 
  Arango: "If we fail to fulfill our duty, the 
Senate of the Republic is there. The Constitution states that 
the Senate should act as our judge."

  [Text] The four magistrates who dissented with the ruling 
that decriminalizes consumption of personal doses of drugs in 
Colombia characterize it as "fatal," "anachronistic," and 
"unconstitutional." 
  The magistrates seriously question the premise that taking 
drugs is part of the right to free development of personality. 
  The four Constitutional Court magistrates who dissented with 
the ruling which decriminalizes the possession and consumption 
of personal doses of drugs characterize as "fatal" the majority 
decision by the court and warn that this is an attack on the 
thousands of victims of Colombia's struggle against drugs. 
  Under the premise that the right to freely develop one's 
personality is all-encompassing, the magistrates warn that it 
could follow that other conduct apparently related to the 
individual person could be construed as legal, for example in 
the case of abortions. 
  "Those of us in dissent emphatically reject this notion. As 
with other opinions, we express our confusion in light of the 
enormous contradiction that has been established by this 
decision," they note. 
  The dissenting magistrates make it clear that the decision 
by 
the five magistrates who support decriminalizing the use of 
drugs was adopted in the total exercise of clearly established 
constitutional powers. 
  The magistrates note, furthermore, that decriminalizing the 
use of drugs in the name of the right to free development of 
personality violates rights to health, coexistence of citizens, 
and family integrity; the principle of solidarity; the 
prevailing general interest; and the obligation to respect the 
rights of others and not abuse one's own. 
  In the magistrates' opinion, abandoning the drug addict "to 
the apparent exercise of his free will does nothing but 
subjugate him to the will of those who manipulate and control 
the infamous drug market. They will be pleased to see how their 
victims are authorized to continue depending on their lethal 
market. [no closing quotation mark as published] 
  It was on these terms that Magistrates Hernando Herrera, 
Vladimiro Naranjo, Jose Hernandez, and Fabio Moron formally 
distanced themselves yesterday from the Constitutional Court's 
decision permitting the decriminalization of the use of personal 
doses of drugs. 
  In their dissenting opinion, the four jurists claim that the 
court's decision reflects a paradox and an ambiguity which are 
very difficult to understand. 
  On the one hand, they say, it authorizes personal doses, but 
on the other it continues the penalization of narcotics. That 
is, it allows individuals to take drugs but prohibits the 
production, distribution, and sale of these same drugs. 
  In their opinion, it is totally illogical that the law 
protects the consumer from a product while punishing he who 
supplies that product. "How can this dilemma be resolved?" the 
magistrates ask. 
  "Perhaps by decriminalizing the production, distribution, 
and 
sale of drugs? That is, by legalizing all narcotrafficking 
activities and thus overnight turning the sinister mafia into 
`honorable merchants and exporters'?" 
  National and international opinion would unanimously 
repudiate--and rightfully so--such a preposterous solution that 
would imply, no more and no less, that with the stroke of a pen 
the worst criminals our history has ever known--those 
responsible for the deaths and kidnappings of thousands and 
thousands of people, assassinations of important people, and the 
systematic collective poisoning of youths--would become innocent 
victims of the weight of the law. 
  According to Herrera, Naranjo, Moron, and Hernandez, the 
motive behind the court's decision must be described as 
"ingenuous" and "anachronistic," because it only reflects the 
19th Century concept of individual liberalism, totally 
disregarding the ideological, political, and economic evolution 
experienced by contemporary liberalism. 
  As for the free development of personality, the four jurists 
firmly declare that this right has been interpreted incorrectly 
in this ruling that has decriminalized drug use. 
  "To interpret, as the majority has done, that this right 
implies the unlimited power of each person to do whatever he 
chooses with his life, even to irrational extremes--such as 
threatening his own physical or mental well-being--is a fatal 
mistake," they state. 
  Further, the jurists who rejected the ruling warn that 
liberty cannot be contrary to humankind, because the human being 
is an end in himself, "therefore, it is incorrect to affirm that 
on behalf of his liberty man should be degenerated, which would 
be equivalent to depersonalizing himself." 
  Herrera, Naranjo, Moron, and Hernandez warn at the same time 
that the decision which decriminalized personal drug doses has 
skimpy legal arguments and added that drug addiction is 
undoubtedly a blatant attack on mankind's dignity. 
  In their opinion, straying from the principle of human 
dignity undoubtedly leads to man's degradation. 
  According to the four magistrates, drug production is by 
every definition an existing crime--not a potential 
crime--against humankind. Tolerating consumption of the cause of 
an evil would mean legitimizing its noxious effects. 
  "In other words, it means legalizing that which is illegal," 
they emphasize. 
  In their opinion, liberty promoted through depraved means is 
conducive to libertinage and does not make man more noble, but 
rather deprives him of his dignity. 
  "Human dignity, therefore, requires that man act according 
to 
his conscience and freedom of choice, that is, led by his own 
convictions and not under pressure from a passion or inordinate 
desire, which deep down is actually coercion," they stated. 
  In explaining their vote, they note therefore that leaving a 
drug addict to his fate is equivalent to leaving him subject to 
the enslavement created by his dependence on drugs. The 
magistrates make it clear that taking drugs cannot be considered 
an indifferent act and warned that the rules that were declared 
unconstitutional--Articles 51 and 87 of Law 30 of 1986--have a 
sound basis in law and in the Constitution. 
  In the final part of their opinion, the four jurists say 
that 
permissiveness in the matter of personal drug doses has had 
harmful effects in Spain and in Great Britain--where the measure 
has been reconsidered--and in the Netherlands. 
  In Great Britain--they note--authorities adopted measures in 
the 1960's and 1970's so that addicts could receive heroin 
legally in drugstores; the result was a 100 percent increase in 
the number of addicts and a 300 percent increase in illegal drug 
trafficking. 
  Alaska enacted--they explain--a law which increased the 
personal doses of marijuana to four ounces (some 140 grams.) 
That resulted in marijuana use among children between 11 and 14 
growing to three times the U.S. national average. This law was 
revoked recently. 
  "It should be noted, also, that these cases were in 
countries 
that are not drug producers or exporters; this is not the case 
in Colombia, where high rates of consumption are added to the 
unfortunate fact that this country is one of the principal 
producers and exporters on a global scale, with all the ensuing 
implications," they state.

  [Text] In the last three years, part of the fortune of the 
Valle drug lords has been invested in giving financial support 
to a number of Colombian political leaders. 
  This affirmation is contained in a report on Colombian drug 
trafficking given to Italian authorities by Fernando Brito, 
director of the Administrative Department of Security [DAS], two 
weeks ago. The report claims that after the dismembering of the 
Medellin Cartel, the Valle mafia has consolidated its power to 
such an extent that it controls 75 percent of all drugs shipped 
from Colombia to U.S. and European markets. 
  The report says that in the last decade other organizations 
have created veritable industries in which departmentalized 
networks are involved in the process of obtaining raw materials, 
processing, internal transportation, and international drug 
trafficking. The fortunes of these organizations have 
infiltrated the construction industry, drugstore chains, radio 
stations, automobile dealerships, department stores, factories, 
banks, sports clubs, and even investment firms. 
  The report claims that the drug trafficking organizations 
run 
a large number of offices in the United States and Europe that 
handle hard currency derived from drug trafficking. However, 
the Valle mafia is outstanding because of a "managerial 
organization with business criteria and decentralization." The 
report states that at present the Valle drug lords are not 
participating in cocaine exports but that they receive a 
percentage of the shipments of other drug traffickers for the 
use of distribution routes and networks under their control. 
The analysis indicates that complementing the support of 
political leaders, a large part of drug trafficking money is 
invested in real estate; another part is exchanged into pesos; 
and another large part is deposited in international banks 
abroad. Following that order, the report says, the money sent 
abroad is funneled toward the creation of new front companies 
for drug trafficking operations or into high yield investments 
in the stock market. 
  Other organizations have a marked tendency to launder money 
through fictitious exports using official documents and dummy 
corporations that act as customs agents in the transfer of money 
to Colombia. Currently the organizations have expanded their 
drug trafficking networks abroad and are investing capital in 
casinos, real estate firms, travel agencies, and night clubs in 
various countries in Europe. Thus, drug money has been detected 
in Spain, Luxembourg, Italy, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and even 
in Russia. 
  Other drug cartels send money orders and money transfers 
through agencies in charge of cashing foreign checks and 
receiving foreign payments. It is difficult to trace money 
derived from drug trafficking in these types of operations. In 
internal drug trafficking, the cartels use eight departments to 
ship drugs to the drug distribution centers abroad.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 26 May (EFE) -- Alleged drug 
trafficker Humberto Renteria of a northern Valle Department drug 
cartel today surrendered to justice in Cali. Renteria decided 
to surrender because he has "accounts pending" with justice 
officials and which link him to drug trafficking, according to 
sources at the Valle Regional Prosecutor's Office. 
  The repentant drug trafficker appeared before this office in 
the company of his lawyer. He is now waiting to be assigned to 
the prison where he will stay until his legal situation is 
defined. Renteria's action came several days after the 
suspension of the gradual surrenders of alleged members of drug 
trafficking gangs in Valle and Cali. 
  The top leaders of this country's drug trafficking gangs, 
brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, as well as 
others, announced some months ago their willingness to turn 
themselves in, but they have not done so even though their 
lawyers have contacted judicial authorities on several occasions. 
  Renteria and other drug traffickers who have surrendered 
have 
agreed to accept the government's surrender policy, which offers 
them legal advantages and sentence reductions.

<F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The internal disturbance decree that recently 
prevented a mass release of prison inmates today was placed in a 
precarious position. The "National Newscast" has learned that 
this afternoon, the prosecutor will tell the Constitutional 
Court that the decree is unconstitutional. This will be 
announced in the next few hours. 
  Over the past two years, the government has issued internal 
disturbance decrees eight times. The most recent implementation 
of this measure was to prevent a mass exodus of inmates from 
Colombian jails. 
  The arguments the prosecutor could wield to call for a 
ruling 
that such decrees are unconstitutional are as follow: 
  1. He says that eight internal disturbance decrees have been 
used to undermine the rights of due process of many inmates who, 
because of the expiration of deadlines, should have been 
released from prison a long time ago, as stipulated by the Penal 
Procedures Code. 
  2. He criticizes the state for being unable to conduct 
investigations on people facing drug-trafficking and terrorism 
charges in an efficient and timely manner. 
  The court has already rejected a request from the prosecutor 
that it delay its ruling on the most recent internal disturbance 
decrees. The official ruling will be handed down in 20 days.

  [Excerpts] Santa Fe de Bogota, 27 May (EFE) -- 
Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper favors maintaining an open 
policy, initiated by current President Cesar Gaviria, toward 
Cuba, indicating he will not sponsor measures against the Cuban 
people. 
  "I will not sponsor measures that go against the Cuban 
people 
such as the embargo provided for by the Torricelli Bill. I will 
continue relations with Cuba, initiated by President Gaviria. 
Although we may not agree, as we do not with some aspects of the 
Cuban political system, while the Island's government does not 
meddle in Colombia's internal matters, we will support these 
relations." 
  During an exclusive interview with EFE, Samper, one of the 
two candidates leading the polls for the up-coming presidential 
elections, expressed his opinion on some current international 
issues. Here are some excerpts. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Drug Legalization </H5>
  Fifteen years ago, when I proposed drug legalization, this 
problem was reduced to the marijuana plantations in the Sierra 
Nevada of Santa Marta. At that time, my theory was to give the 
peasants the possibility to substitute their crops and leave 
behind drugs. What was done was to increase the pressure and to 
spray the plantations. From marijuana we went to cocaine, from 
cocaine to drug trafficking, and from drug trafficking to 
narcoterrorism. Currently drug legalization is not feasible in 
Colombia. It would be seen as an amnesty, as a pardon for all 
that has occurred in the nation in the past 15 years. This does 
not mean that the international arguments I then outlined do not 
continue to hold true. Drug consuming nations are not making 
significant efforts to reduce drug consumption nor to control 
money laundering. Until there is world-wide legalization, 
Colombia's obligation is to demand more firmly that the consumer 
nations make a greater effort. 
<H5>  Drug Trafficking and Economy </H5>
  Drug trafficking is what makes the opening process in 
Colombia difficult. It is being used to destabilize the source 
of capital, and it is also destabilizing the opening and 
importation process. We cannot ignore that with these mechanisms 
of free exchange and free trade some hot money from drug 
trafficking seeking to become legitimate have infiltrated. 
  One must be careful with regard to the issue of exchange 
revenues, and we must partially reestablish customs, because we 
have practically dismantled them. An opening process is very 
simple. Imports are allowed, with the monetary margin obtained; 
the use of dollars is created; exports are devaluated and 
stimulated; and with this more imports are purchased. Here we 
only went halfway. We allowed imports and the entrance of 
capital. Large amounts of speculative capital arrived forcing 
us to revaluate our currency. With this revaluation we have held 
back exports. This adversely affects jobs, agriculture, and 
industries, because in an open economy revaluation does away 
with everything. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate for </F>
the Colombian Conservative Party; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] Friends: This has been an extraordinary campaign 
for all of us. It has been a trip to the future, a trip of our 
hearts and souls. 
  All over the country, amid both problems and hopes, I have 
sensed a strong desire for change. I can tell you the time has 
come. I have seen it in the faces of Colombians, men and women, 
children, youths, and elderly people, from La Guajira to Narino 
and from the Pacific to the Amazon. They have said it: 
Colombia's time is here. I have sensed that desire for change 
in the hands I have shaken and in the people's embrace. They 
have said it; you say it; and I say it: Colombia's time is here. 
  This has not been simply a candidate's campaign. This 
campaign has been inspired by one cause: Making Colombia a 
country of opportunities, putting an end to the vices of the old 
policy and starting a head-on struggle against poverty, whose 
shadow has been following us for some time. [passage omitted] 
  Perhaps the most complex part of my job as mayor was the 
handling of narcoterrorism, which not only hit political leaders 
and the powerful who find protection more easily, but common 
citizens who at any time could become the next victim of 
uncontrolled violence. Today, violence and insecurity still 
prevail throughout the country, claiming lives every day and 
building fear among Colombians. It is difficult to convince 
investors to risk their opportunities in a virtual war zone. 
  We have made some progress in the last few years. However, a 
Colombia under the stigma and threat of violence will always be 
a nation that will not be able to develop fully its economic and 
human potential. As president, I will spare no effort, and I 
pledge to do everything within my reach to ensure that peace and 
harmony will blossom again in all the corners of the country, 
because our families, our parents, and our children are the 
foundations of society. We must live again free from threats of 
violence, drug trafficking, and drugs. 
  We need more strength and perseverance in the fight against 
fear and violence. We must not fear fear itself. The 
guerrillas and terrorists struck a diabolical alliance. As 
president, I will not hesitate to enforce the law. I already 
told the country that the government does not choose between war 
and peace; the government's responsibility is to respect the 
institutions and to defend the lives of Colombians. This 
responsibility leaves no room for arguments and focuses the 
government's unavoidable attitude on fighting subversion. 
  Should the guerrillas want peace, they must prove it with 
facts rather than with empty remarks and simple rhetorical 
speeches. Should they be willing to do this, I will be glad to 
personally negotiate with those who have taken up arms, with a 
positive attitude and without shirking my duties. This is the 
broadest hope a ruler can offer. However, should the guerrillas 
maintain their current attitude, I will exert authority without 
hesitation, because it is my duty. I am a friend of peace, yet 
I refuse to engage in fruitless talks, as previous presidents 
did. As they became frustrated, our fellow countrymen lost 
faith and confidence. 
  I will reinforce the Armed Forces and the Police to make 
them 
into a professional army. I will end the compulsory draft, and 
I will invest in military intelligence to effectively combat 
those who insist on destabilizing the institutions and making 
attempts on the lives and patrimony of Colombians. I am 
determined to strongly repress drug trafficking, dirty money, 
and corruption, with the moral authority our liberator once 
dreamed of. I will try to make Colombia the moral country the 
immense majority wants. At the same time, I will fight the 
socioeconomic causes that triggered the spread of these scourges 
and drug consumption in Colombia. You can be sure of one thing: 
I will support neither the legalization of drugs, nor its 
production, commercialization, or consumption. This flat-out 
defiance was and will always be my position. This position is 
not new for me; I have always thought like this, because I 
believe that drugs consumed 15 years ago were as harmful for our 
youths as the ones currently consumed. 
  We must all commit ourselves to rescue our countryside, 
cities, streets, and thoroughfares from criminal hands in order 
to reestablish harmony among the citizenry. We will create 
specialized groups to rid the country of mafias made up of 
apartment thieves [apartamenteros], car thieves [jaladores], and 
all types of thugs, starting in large cities. 
  To close my speech, which is being televised for the benefit 
of the Colombian people, I will speak from my heart: a long 
battle is about to end, and I hope that everything that 
previously divided us is left behind and that we work together 
to achieve a united fatherland. I have tried not to focus on my 
contenders' mistakes. If they hurt me, the wounds are already 
healed. I sincerely extend my friendly hand to all those who 
sought to be democratically elected by recognizing that their 
messages were impregnated with love for Colombia, a Colombia we 
all agree must be better and fairer. 
  Someday when this campaign is long forgotten, I want it to 
be 
said that we embarked on it full of love for Colombia, trusting 
that our efforts would help it progress. Moreover, I want it to 
be said that we did not alter the faith in and the loyalty to 
our principles and that we attempted to display the best 
feelings of our population in my actions and words. We hurt no 
fellow countrymen; our unalterable objective was to join efforts 
toward accomplishing a common national goal. We were determined 
to make our presidential term the crusade to ready our country 
for entering the threshold of progress and reconciliation as we 
approach the new century. 
  I believe a president's mission is to fight to ensure that 
each one of us has a job and an income. I believe the struggle 
for the well-being of all of us within the framework of peace 
must constitute a president's daily struggles. I also believe 
the next president's efforts will focus on fighting for a 
Colombia full of opportunities. This is why I am currently 
seeking your mandate. Your needs and expectations will become 
the yardstick for my decisions. I will strive to build a 
country, a government, and an economy that will reflect the 
kindness, honesty, and strength of our people. I cannot promise 
you everything, but I can promise you one thing: Should you 
decide to give me an opportunity, with God's blessings and help, 
I will not fail you. With our vote, let's make Sunday [29 May] 
the day to forge the Colombia we all dream of. Good evening.

  [Text] Havana, 24 May (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Foreign 
Ministry today favorably reacted to an official U.S. report 
acknowledging the struggle the Havana Government has been waging 
against drug trafficking. Miguel Alfonso, a Cuban Foreign 
Ministry spokesman, referring to the U.S. State Department 
report issued last week, told the media: "It is belated, but we 
welcome it." 
  The spokesman said that the Foreign Ministry does not yet 
have any official analysis of the document, which is being 
analyzed by the Directorate of Multilateral Affairs. Alfonso 
announced, though, that this "recognition" of Cuba's official 
policy for the control of drug trafficking "is somewhat belated." 
  The U.S. State Department report pointed out "efforts the 
Cuban Government has made to prevent drug trafficking in its 
territorial waters and air space." The document also praised 
the steps the Caribbean nation has taken in this direction and 
noted that the Cuban authorities have reinforced their 
antidrug-trafficking struggle. The Cuban spokesman stated: "Our 
government's policy on the struggle against drug trafficking is 
long-lived."

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Four Guatemalan 
children were rescued by the police from a secret nursery in the 
home of a U.S. citizen who was arrested and charged with drug 
trafficking. 
  Police sources reported today, Saturday, that the children 
were found in a home owned by U.S. citizen Sara Matzar in 
Pabnjachel in the northwestern department of Solola. The 
residence was searched following the issuing of a judicial 
order, and a woman identified as Martina Matzar Sapin, who was 
caring for the children and is related to Sara, was arrested. 
  The children were identified as twins Joaquin and Rigoberto, 
five; Marcela Mercedes, three; and Eva Noelia Peron, five. 
  Martina Matzar said the four children are Sara's adopted 
children. She is being held in a prison in the Guatemalan 
capital, accused of alleged drug trafficking. Her extradition 
has been requested by the U.S. Embassy. 
  Police are investigating to determine the origin of the four 
children who, according to Martina Matzar, are from Santa 
Catarina Palopo, Solola. 
  There have been two incidents in 1994 involving two U.S. 
citizens accused by Guatemalan residents of being child 
snatchers, although the charges turned out to be false. 
  The U.S. Embassy has denied that its citizens are involved 
in 
the kidnapping of children.

  [Text] The antidrug brigade made a spectacular seizure of 
cocaine at the Port-au-Prince Airport by intercepting 143 kg of 
cocaine going to the United States on board an American Airlines 
plane. The cocaine was being carried by two Haitians residing in 
the United States, who were arrested. Another person, a Canadian 
of Haitian origin, was also apprehended with one kg of cocaine 
and three pounds of marijuana while he was getting ready to 
travel abroad. Clarence Renois questioned Colonel [Antoine] 
Atouriste, who is in charge of the Antidrug Service. [begin 
recording] 
  Atouriste: [Word or words indistinct] only cocaine 
yesterday. It was very unusual. We have never had such a case at 
the airport before. 
  Renois: Where did those drugs transiting through 
Haiti, that you fortunately succeeded in intercepting, come 
from, Colonel? 
  Atouriste: Just like for the other Caribbean 
countries, the drug comes from Colombia. We are situated on the 
international axis for the international traffic from south to 
north--meaning from Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia to the United 
States or Europe. It is therefore indispensable for the drugs to 
go through Haiti. Of course we know that many measures have 
been taken in Haiti. We have been in control of the situation 
for many years, despite certain false allegations by certain 
sectors or by the opposition, which is continuing its campaign 
of denigration. [Word or words indistinct] in the Caribbean, and 
it is done as well in Haiti. 
  Renois: Could you say today, Colonel, that the 
antidrug brigade controls the drug-trafficking situation in 
Haiti totally? 
  Atouriste: I tell you sincerely that to see what 
we have been able to accomplish with the support of the 
authorities concerned constitutes our greatest satisfaction. The 
system is under control and they [not further identified] know 
that. You have heard about the latest report of the 
international observers in that regard, how they congratulate 
Haiti despite the embargo. We have accomplished without much 
money what the Haitian Government was never able to accomplish 
in the past, before 1991. 
  Renois: Indeed, Colonel Atouriste, there is a 
report from the U.S. Justice Department that calls into question 
high-ranking Army officers, who are allegedly involved in 
protecting this trafficking from Colombia to Haiti to the United 
States. An investigation has been opened, in that regard. Is the 
Haitian Army or the Antidrug Service concerned about that? 
  Atouriste: Your question is quite political. We 
are technicians. I will simply say to you that the Haitian Army 
is now the dog to kill. When one wishes to kill his dog, he 
accuses it of being rabid. But we are from the Army and we have 
been fighting drugs for more than a quarter of a century in 
Haiti. The Haitian law on narcotics dates from 1971. To my 
knowledge, the Haitian Armed Forces are in charge of fighting 
drugs, and continue to do so. I want to believe that what you 
hear on the media nowadays is again this sick sector of the 
national life that is continuing its campaign of denigration, or 
that it is this sector of the international community that is 
affected by this virus that you know. That is my opinion on 
that. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] Attorney General Humberto Benitez Trevino has 
started a total restructuring of the Federal Judicial Police 
(PJF), and he has ordered the dismantling of the "special 
groups" and the General Operations Coordinating Office. In 
addition, Benitez Trevino is reviewing the relationship of this 
corps with other agencies in an effort to make it more efficient 
and to prevent illegal actions. 
  Five commanders have been discharged, and the files of the 
PJF's approximately 2,000 agents, all of whom will undergo drug 
testing, will be carefully reviewed. If evidence of irregular 
or criminal conduct is established, they will be discharged and 
legal action will be taken against them. 
  These actions are being viewed as a response to remarks by 
former Attorney General Diego Valades Rios, who has claimed that 
whenever PJF agents are discharged it is because they have drug 
abuse problems or are connected with drug traffickers. The PGR 
[Attorney General's Office], meanwhile, indicated that the 
measures correspond to the need to have a single command in the 
PJF. 
  Regarding the dismantling of the so-called "special groups," 
the PGR said this action was prompted by "special group" 
investigations that fell outside the Judicial Police General 
Directorate's jurisdiction and proved detrimental to citizens. 
  Commenting on the elimination of the General Operations 
Coordinating Office, which violated PGR regulations, was 
allegedly conducting investigations, and had command over the 
PJF agents. [sentence as published] In light of this, 
Commanders Juventino Sanchez Gaytan, Agustin Montiel Lopez, Saul 
Salvatierra Garcia, Carlos Venegas Contreras, and Luis Alberto 
Zetina Suarez were discharged. 
  Meanwhile, Attorney General Benitez Trevino has also ordered 
a rigorous review of the condition and status of the 
approximately 2,000 PJF agents nationwide and evaluations of 
their individual performances in an effort to detect "bad" 
agents. If this review turns up evidence of any agent being 
involved in irregularities or illegal actions, appropriate 
administrative measures will be adopted and legal action will be 
taken. 
  A review of of personnel will also be conducted to detect 
"reliable" or "commissoned" individuals, who are also known as 
"godmothers"--people who do not belong to the PJF but perform 
actions in support of the police corps. Those who have usurped 
powers, as well as the commanders and agents who have helped 
them do so, will be prosecuted.

  [Begin Benitez recording] The only way of obtaining

Institute. [end recording] 
  He reiterated that in the fight against corruption, no one

above the law. Benitez also admitted that crime has increased 5 
percent in the Federal District over the past four months.

  [Text] Mexico City, 26 May (EFE) -- A source at the Mexico 
City Attorney General's Office told EFE today that Jose Luis 
Fortuna, commander of the Judicial Federal Police, was murdered 
by a gunshot in his forehead and left in his own car on the 
highway to Ajusco on the outskirts of Mexico City. The source 
said Metropolitan Police members found the commander's body in 
the car at approximately 1330 local (1730 GMT) on the border 
between Mexico City and the State of Mexico. 
  The body, the head of which was covered with a sack, 
received 
a gunshot wound to the forehead. A spent 9-mm cartridge was 
found on the car's floor, the official reported. The commander 
was identified by his electoral voting card, which has a 
picture, and the badge of the Attorney General's Office, which 
identified him as commander.

  [Excerpts] The Mexican Bishops Conference [CEM] asserted, 
through its secretary general, Bishop Ramon Godinez, that the 
capture of the Baja California deputy attorney general, Sergio 
Ortiz Lara, represents an advance in the investigation of 
Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas' assassination. He added that this 
act could help to dismantle the Tijuana and Guadalajara drug 
trafficking cartels that have damaged the country with violence 
and death. [passage omitted] 
  Godinez explained: "We believe that this capture advances 
the 
investigation of Cardinal Posadas' murder mainly because the one 
captured is alleged to be linked to the escape of persons 
connected with the Arellano Felix group. This incident also 
leads us to regard as valid the hypothesis cited by the Mexican 
bishops in 1988, to the effect that drug trafficking would not 
occur if certain authorities were not implicated in it. This 
phenomenon is taking place in a clever, despicable manner on 
that market." 
  He continued: "I think that we must make a distinction among 
the varying degrees of responsibility existing on the drug 
market, that is, in the drug traffic, ranging from large-scale 
traffickers to authorities concealing or protecting them, and 
including those growing and distributing drugs. 
  "This capture gives us hope that we may learn the details of 
Cardinal Posadas' assassination. Furthermore, although this is 
an extremely difficult and complex task, we think that it could 
help to eliminate the drug trafficking cartels in Tijuana and 
Guadalajara. As pastors, what is most important to us is to 
prevent evils such as drug addiction, especially among the most 
vulnerable population: children and adolescents." [passage 
omitted] 
  He explained that the bishops are aware that "although the 
drug trade has large-scale production and distribution 
operations in the national territory," it is primarily a problem 
of international dimensions. It is in other countries, such as 
the United States, that the major drug trafficking 
decision-making centers operate, and the largest drug 
consumption market exists. 
  He emphasized that, in the text issued by the Bishops 
Conference, an analysis is made of the very close ties linking 
the drug traffic to violence and the arms trade. Those involved 
in it are risking their lives and those of their families. 
"Almost every day we hear of murders, to the point where this 
state of violence has become customary in some of the country's 
towns and regions." [passage omitted] 
  He stressed that, in the case of the drug traffic, a 
distinction must nevertheless be made among the varying degrees 
of responsibility. The guilt of the large-scale drug market 
leaders, who have all the power and cleverness for carrying out 
their sinister business, and of the authorities implicated, is 
not the same as that of the day laborers, including peasants and 
Indians. The latter are associated with this activity because of 
their ignorance or extreme financial need. 
  Finally, he indicated that the complete solution to the drug 
trafficking problem would lie in eliminating the demand, and 
rehabilitating the society demanding drugs. For this reason, he 
claimed, the consumer countries must also assume the share of 
the blame that they deserve.

<F P=106> [Report by David Aponte and Gerado Rico] </F>
  [Text] Guadalajara, Jalisco, 23 May -- The new archbishop 
of Guadalajara, Juan Sandoval Iniguez, said today that 40 
percent of the personnel in the Attorney General Office's (PGR) 
are "involved" in drug trafficking. This is why "no one has 
gotten to the bottom" of the homicide of Cardinal Juan Jose 
Posadas Ocampo and why the Arellano Felix brothers have not been 
arrested. 
  He said that high-level PGR officials "told me" that they 
are 
not absolutely sure which Federal Judicial Police (PJF) agents 
are trustworthy and honest, and which are linked to drug 
trafficking. 
  This has complicated the capture of the Arellano Felix 
brothers, chiefs of the Tijuana Cartel, "because when the police 
are told that they are in a certain place by the time the police 
get there they are already somewhere else." The police 
themselves give them a heads-up, the archbishop said. 
  He said that the Catholic Church is not satisfied with the 
results of the investigation because it has not gotten to the 
bottom of the matter and the PGR has not arrested the real 
killers. 
  There is no "room for percentages" in assessing how the 
investigation is going, because we do not know who the real 
killers are or their motives for the murder. The PGR has fought 
drug trafficking, but "they have not had the answers" to 
Cardinal Posadas' case. 
  In light of this, he said, Mexicans run the risk that 
impunity "may become entrenched in our fatherland and that we 
will end up with a violent society, a dangerous society," if the 
homicides of Cardinal Posadas and Luis Donaldo Colosio are not 
solved. 
  The archbishop called a news conference in the capitular 
room 
of the Archdiocese of Guadalajara on the day before the first 
anniversary of the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. 
Before beginning his remarks, he asked reporters from the 
international, national, and local media to pray. 
  He then began: "We have always said that we still are not 
satisfied, that the investigation has not gotten to the bottom 
of the case, that we are not happy because no one has gotten to 
the bottom of this since the real killers have not been 
captured. All Mexicans wish--not just the Church--that 
investigations will continue and that this crime will soon be 
cleared up." 
  Question: What is your evaluation of the 
authorities' behavior, especially that of the PGR? 
  Sandoval Iniguez: We have been in touch with 
high-ranking PGR officials. They have assured me that they are 
very interested in the investigation, that they are determined 
to clear up the murder. In fact they want some assistance, some 
of our help. This is why we have called on anyone who may have 
some information... It could be that these people may supply 
details that may have been misinterpreted by others. 
  "They face many difficulties on this road: first, because a 
year has already passed and second, because all municipal, 
state, or federal police forces in Mexico are either 
contaminated a little or a lot. They were telling me, for 
example, that 40 percent of the people who work for the PGR are 
not to be trusted. They say that even they do not know who is 
who; they do not know who the trustworthy and honest agents are. 
They do not know who is involved with the drug traffickers or 
with other groups who buy off these people's consciences. 
  "That is how the security forces are infiltrated and why 
they 
have people working there who are not trustworthy." 
  Question: Could this be blocking the 
investigations? 
  Sandoval Iniguez: ...They (high-level PGR 
officers) claim this is one of the reasons why this and other 
investigations have not been wrapped up. They even told me that 
when they go to arrest criminals, some people warn the criminals 
in advance. When they arrive on the scene, the criminals are 
gone. That could be one of the reasons. 
  The same is true of the Arellano Felix brothers, who escape 
when they learn that authorities are coming after them. Drug 
traffickers have plenty of money to corrupt and buy off people's 
consciences and thus ward off any action against them, he said. 
  But the Catholic Church will not fight that kind of 
corruption. There will be other ways for that. But it will not 
stop insisting, as all citizens must, that the homicide should 
be resolved even after the current six-year presidential term 
ends, he added. 
  Surrounded by some of his aides in the room housing 
paintings 
of the archbishops of Guadalajara, Sandoval Iniguez recalled 
that the president of the republic said the crime would be 
solved and said that "he should be asked about it." 
  "I would also like to say in this forum that all society 
should demand, each one of us must demand that justice be done. 
A democratic country must not leave its hopes and dreams in the 
hands of two or three people...this is a demand of all society," 
he said. 
  Question: Are we living in a country of 
half-truths? 
  Sandoval Iniguez: I believe our truths are less 
than half-truths. We can barely get to a half-truth, he said 
ironically. 
  He mentioned that the PGR has not briefed the Archdiocese of 
Guadalajara on the investigations since November 1993. 
  A journalist asked if he feared any possible reprisals for 
his statements. The archbishop said: "I do not think I will be 
the object of reprisals for what I am saying because I am not 
offending or injuring anyone or telling lies." 
  Sandoval Iniguez said that on Tuesday, 24 May, the crypt 
containing the remains of the late cardinal will be open from 
1000 to 1800. During the evening, the archbishop will officiate 
at a mass in memory of Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 19 May -- Federal 
Judicial Police [PJF] units seized 607 kg of marijuana and 
detained a band of drug traffickers formed by members of the 
Municipal Directorate of Public Security and Transportation. 
  Roberto Villalta, who was wearing his work uniform, Gerardo 
Calderon, Patricio Esparza, and another unidentified person were 
taken into custody in the operation. 
  Residents of Bolivia Street, El Barreal Neighborhood, 
reported seeing policemen and Public Security and Transportation 
vehicles constantly arriving at a warehouse where the PJF later 
seized the marijuana. 
  The PJF said it seized 606.84 kg of cannabis and two scales 
used to package the drug. 
  The officers who participated in the operation also 
confiscated a black Chevrolet van with gray stripes bearing 
Texas license plates and a red Pontiac Grand Am with Colorado 
plates. 
  The police said they will continue their investigations and 
hope to make several arrests in connection with the bust. 
  In a related story, the Attorney General's office destroyed 
two plantations in Sinaloa and Baja California estimated to 
cover 20,000 square meters. The plantations, located during 
several reconnaissance flights, were believed to hold 210,000 
marijuana plants. 
  The first plantation was discovered in a ranching area known 
as Las Playitas, Sinaloa de Leyva Municipality. Several PJF 
units converged on the area and destroyed marijuana plants and 
heroin poppies growing on 3.5 square meters. 
  Meanwhile, a 15 square-meter [as published] marijuana 
plantation was found and destroyed near Rewal del Castillo Viejo 
and Enecua along the Ojos Negros Highway, Encenada, Baja 
California. 
  Police found three pickaxes, two shovels, two hoes, four 
machetes, an axe, a container of gasoline, two 22-caliber 
rifles, one 30-30 caliber and six 7.62-caliber cartridges, a 
7.62 caliber clip, and a Chevrolet Blazer with California plates.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gaston Garcia Cantu] </F>
  [Excerpts] Organized crime in Tijuana is bent on creating a 
legal vacuum, just as Pablo Escobar did in Medellin. The 
procedures are the same: corruption of police and public 
servants, terrorism against those fighting it, and social 
donations to obtain accomplices in the society. During the final 
phase of consolidating its power, there is the assassination of 
judges. 
  The drug traffic has set up its activities in the border 
towns, the final stopping places leading toward drug consumption 
in the United States. 
  The unequivocal phase in Tijuana is that of the struggle 
between two rings to seize exclusive control over the traffic. 
To establish their supremacy, the phase includes corruption of 
judicial authorities. 
  Tijuana, currently governed by the PAN [National Action 
Party], as it was in the past by the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party], is the obvious territory for entrenching 
the drug traffic's power, because of the land and sea routes to 
the United States. This situation is the one associated by the 
attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades, with the 
general features of the crimes preceding the one now attracting 
the public's attention. That precedent, with its tragic 
continuity, is explained by the goals sought by the two rings 
fighting for Tijuana. 
  Initially, during the 1970's, Felix Gallardo, now imprisoned 
at Almoloya, Mexico State, was the leader of those now 
comprising rival groups: Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero 
Palma"; Joaquin Guzman Loera, "El Chapo Guzman," also 
imprisoned; and the Arellano Felix brothers, who are fugitives. 
The ring moved from Sinaloa to Guadalajara, where its members 
operated as a cartel, unquestionably associated with the group 
in Cali, Colombia. The scope of its operations has included the 
states of Michoacan, Colima, Jalisco, Nayarit, Sonora, and Baja 
California. Insofar as organized crime is concerned, it is a 
vast domain. This is the cause of the violence for gaining 
power, with the principal chiefs imprisoned. [passage omitted] 
  The latest incidents have been the confrontation in Tijuana 
on 3 March of this year, and the murder of Federico Benitez 
Lopez, public safety director, who went to the airport based on 
an anonymous tip concerning an alleged bomb on that site. 
  The last two episodes are identical from the standpoint of 
the criminals' deployment and their brutality toward their 
victims. It is a war to the death for criminal power in Tijuana, 
with the complicity of police and state authorities, as one 
infers from the incidents on 3 March, particularly, and on 28 
April. 
  What occurred in March is public knowledge: Commander 
Alejandro Castaneda Andrade and six agents under his orders were 
riding in two PGR [Attorney General's Office] vans toward a 
residence in which it was suspected, with reason, that a meeting 
was being held by the Arellano Felix ring, when several vehicles 
drove by in tandem. Andrade and agent Arturo Morales caught up 
with the last one, ordering the driver to stop. The response 
came with shots fired at them pointblank. Andrade was killed, 
and Morales seriously wounded. Shots were fired from the van 
following Andrade, and the agents managed to overcome four 
survivors. Three died, and another, wounded, was taken to the 
IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] hospital. 
  Within minutes, State Judicial Police agents and Tijuana 
municipal police whose help was requested by the federal forces 
arrived on the scene of the attack. The state [deputy] attorney 
general, Sergio Ortiz Lara (whose detention has evoked protests 
from Governor Ruffo Appel and from the PAN national leader, 
Carlos Castillo Peraza), was accompanied by the agent from the 
State Public Prosecutor's Office, Carlos Guerrero Zermeno, and 
other police agents. Playing their last card against the federal 
police, the latter took with them Ortiz Lara, and one of the 
four in custody, later identified as Ismael Higuera Guerrero, 
aka "El Mayel," from the Arellano Felix ring. At that point, two 
persons emerged from another van, firing at the federal agents, 
one of whom was seriously wounded. All those who were in custody 
disappeared. Jesus Hernandez Tejeda, a State Judicial Police 
member, was captured later. 
  Remanded for these acts were the deputy attorney general, 
Ortiz Lara; the State Public Prosecutor's Office agent, Guerrero 
Zermeno; five State Judicial Police group chiefs; and a 
commander from the Public Safety Directorate. The remand was 
based on "probable guilt of the commission of four crimes, and 
others that may result from the investigations." 
  It is known that, when Deputy Attorney General Ortiz Lara 
was 
summoned regarding the incident, he displayed an amparo, which 
explains why the subsequent order for his capture, executed on 
Wednesday of this week, came from the Second Unified Court of 
the 15th Circuit in Tijuana. 
  The criminal under arrest, apparently protected by Deputy 
Attorney General Ortiz Lara, escaped from that town. 
  These facts, part of a criminal process, do not authorize 
anyone, much less the governor of Baja California Norte, Ernesto 
Ruffo Appel, to describe as irresponsible the historical comment 
made by the attorney general of the republic concerning the drug 
traffic in Tijuana. Those records explain that there is a 
criminal organization here, with networks in other countries; 
and that, consequently, from Sicily to Colombia, Honduras, or 
Bolivia, their procedures are the same: subjugating the police 
and judicial authorities with bribes or terrorism, to create the 
legal vacuum and to have their crimes left unpunished. [passage 
omitted] 
  One cannot infer from Diego Valades' statement any political 
intention other than strict application of the law, based on 
demonstrable facts. If the Second Unified Court of the 15th 
District issued the order for the deputy attorney general's 
detention, the arguments for ordering it must have been 
irrefutable, according to law. Hence, it is inexplicable that 
Ruffo Appel, in his complaint, omits this fact that, in itself, 
refutes the political interpretation. It is a legal procedure 
for preserving peace and the rule of law in Tijuana. 
  The governor's verbal attacks unfortunately coincide with 
Carlos Castillo Peraza's correct statement, claiming: "It is of 
little use to build and consolidate the necessary governability 
(the action of Attorney General Diego Valades), when confronted 
with the challenges that such events pose for all Mexicans." The 
best service that could be given to the Tijuana cartel would be 
to dispute a legal act with senseless political interpretations. 
  No one, even if he should propose it in an agitated state, 
could take the PAN to task publicly for incidents in which it 
obviously is not an accomplice, such as the governor defending 
the deputy attorney general, not as a public servant but rather 
as a fellow party member. 
  If the deputy attorney general is innocent of the charges 
brought by the Attorney General's Office, why does the governor 
consider the others captured (the agent from the State Public 
Prosecutor's Office, Guerrero Zermeno, who accompanied the 
deputy attorney general at all times, five State Judicial Police 
group chiefs, and a Public Safety Directorate commander) to be 
blameworthy? He did not even mention them in his protest. 
  This case in Tijuana is not a minor one, because it reveals 
the confusion besetting the country. Legal proceedings are being 
disrupted to prevent an understanding of the real situation. 
Therefore, the action of the Attorney General's Office is seen 
as a political maneuver to discredit the PAN; whereas the facts 
prove that the undeferable intention is to fight, in Tijuana and 
throughout the country, against the legal vacuum that would 
heighten the drug traffickers' power. 
  The dilemma is between the law and coexistence with 
organized 
crime.

  [Excerpt] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 25 April--Business 
firms established here for some time could be involved in the 
"laundering of money" originating in the drug traffic. 
Therefore, the Attorney General's Office (PGR) is investigating 
the activities of at least three companies. This announcement 
was made today by the director of the National Association of 
Manufacturers (Canacintra), Miguel Angel Calderon Rodriguez. 
  He indicated that the department has located money from the 
drug traffic in commercial firms, but not in the manufacturing 
sector. 
  He cautioned that companies proven to have connections with 
that illicit activity will have their membership in Canacintra 
canceled immediately. 
  The state attorney, Francisco Molina Ruiz, declared that 
drug 
trafficking rings have infiltrated several areas of society, 
including the business-owning sector. 
  He noted that, two weeks ago, the U.S. agency fighting drugs 
(DEA) in El Paso, Texas, seized five tons of cocaine and 
arrested eight presumed drug traffickers, including the owner of 
the Jomar chain of stationery stores, Joel Omar Chavez Quezada. 
  Nevertheless, the attorney claimed not to know the names of 
the firms presumably implicated in laundering money representing 
the proceeds from dealing in that alkaloid. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, 26 April--The 
Democratic Forum Party congressman from Matamoros, Argelio 
Hinojosa, stated today that the drug traffic on the Tamaulipas 
border has increased during recent years as a result of the 
complicity between those engaged in that activity and the police. 
  He commented: "There is obvious protection for drug 
trafficking rings given by the various federal, state, and 
municipal police forces. Therefore, despite the official stories 
to the contrary, that activity has increased." 
  He claimed to have made charges to this effect on repeated 
occasions, but said that they were not heeded because there was 
no will to attack the problem, since "people in high places are 
implicated in this crime." 
  The legislator noted that the rise in drug trafficking is 
well known, as shown by the constant executions of "narcos" in 
several of the state's towns. 
  He added that the problem is alarming, but admitted that 
Tamaulipas society is by now used to living with violence, 
caused mainly by drug traffickers on the border. 
  He declared that the complicity between police and "narcos" 
is an age-old situation, contributing to the wealth of many 
policemen, particularly that of State and Federal Judicial 
Police [PJF] assigned to the area. 
  He concluded by saying: "It is incongruous that PJE [State 
Judicial Police] agents earning a monthly salary of 1,200 new 
pesos should own residences and late model vehicles." 
  Today, the mayor of Abasolo, Juvenal Ramirez Lucio, claimed 
that drug traffickers have established an air route in the 
municipalities of Jimenez, Soto la Marina, and Abasolo for 
transporting narcotics to the United States. He added that the 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) had, nevertheless, minimized the 
situation. 
  He indicated that small planes often fly at low altitudes 
over the region to avoid being detected by the authorities; an 
activity that has proven alarming to the area's residents. 
  He explained that reports of this have been given to the PGR 
representative on various occasions, the response being a 
promise to conduct operations in the area. 
  He commented: "As mayors, all we ask of them is air 
surveillance, and that they notify us when they intend to arrest 
someone living in an Indian community, to avoid frightening the 
people." 
  He added that the settlers' fear was heightened even more 
two 
months ago, when a drug trafficking ring kidnapped two young 
residents whom it suspected of having appropriated a cocaine 
shipment dropped from a plane in flight that was being pursued 
by the PGR. 
  He noted that the peasants were brutally tortured, to the 
extent of causing the death of one, while the other was severely 
injured. 
  He explained that the peasants, especially those in the 
community of La Esperanza, the largest in Abasolo, often find on 
their plots of land electrical equipment that has been dropped 
from planes in full flight, carrying contraband to the country's 
interior. 
  He said that the route is used in both directions, because 
some also follow it to transport "fayuca" [smuggled goods for 
street vending], although the most disturbing use is for drug 
trafficking. 
  It should be mentioned that, according to police reports, 
during the past four years four small planes carrying drugs from 
Colombia have crashed in those municipalities. 
  In one case, the "narcos" managed to escape with a ton of 
cocaine, which they concealed on a farm in this town, where it 
was later discovered by the PJF.

  [Excerpts] Over 45,000 warrants for arrest, rearrest, 
presentation, and appearance before federal courts, including 
those issued against drug traffickers, tax evaders, defrauders, 
and ex-civil servants, are still awaiting implementation by 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents. Moreover, during this 
administration, the Attorney General's Office [PGR] has remanded 
to district judges of criminal proceedings over 90,000 persons 
involved in crimes against health, at least 60,000 of whom have 
been released. 
  Based on reports provided by the PGR, it was learned that no 
fewer than 45,000 court orders issued against traffickers and 
killers, including Luis Hector Palma Salazar, aka "El Guero," 
Amado Carrillo Fuentes, Juan Garcia Abrego, and the Arellano 
brothers, Francisco, Ramon, Javier, and Benjamin, have not been 
implemented by the PJF. This is said to have "unquestionably 
fostered the atmosphere of violence and insecurity being 
experienced in the majority of the country's federative states." 
  Agents from that department assigned to the Arrests 
Directorate maintained that the delay in implementing orders for 
arrest, rearrest, appearance, and presentation "has declined 
considerably." Observing that it was reduced as much as 50 
percent within the past two years, they nevertheless admit that 
the number of unfulfilled orders "may still be considered large." 
  Among those yet to be implemented are warrants relating not 
only to drug traffickers, but also to ex-civil servants who took 
advantage of their positions to gain large sums of money. 
[passage omitted] 
  The investigative agents acknowledged that the lack of 
personnel, as well as the limits imposed on them, "play a major 
role in the possible deficiencies occurring in the 
implementation of court orders. Therefore, efforts must be 
redoubled to end the delay." 
  The Federal Judicial Police agents themselves expressed the 
view that the Attorney General's Office high command, which is 
aware of the delay, should order an increase in the number of 
personnel to implement those warrants. They remarked that it 
should not divert personnel to "pursue those selling counterfeit 
video and audio cassettes," a task that they claim might well be 
performed by crime prevention police under orders from the 
Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. 
  Moreover, investigations conducted in the PGR itself and in 
the courts reveal that, during the past five years, the social 
representative's office has remanded to district judges 
throughout the country some 90,000 persons presumed guilty of 
crimes against health. At least 60,000 of them have regained 
their freedom. It is believed that the release of those 
implicated in crimes against health has been due to deficiencies 
in completing the preliminary investigations. 
  It was also found that a large percentage of the orders not 
yet implemented by the PJF have been issued against criminals 
who were released after having been remanded, in whose cases the 
judges failed to find evidence of guilt.

  [Text] Culiacan, Sinaloa, 6 May--Eight ships and 300 marine 
forces from the Navy Secretariat, 2,000 Army troops, and 250 
Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents will participate in a 
coordinated counternarcotics operation. This announcement was 
made today, individually, by the Eighth Naval Zone, the Third 
Military Region, and the Attorney General's Office (PGR). 
  In this connection, the latter department's representative, 
Luis Antonio Ibanez Cornejo, reported that, since January, the 
PJF [Federal Judicial Police] has turned 500 persons over to the 
competent judicial authorities for implication in crimes against 
health and illegal carrying of weapons. 
  He indicated that, on highways and roads, and in towns, 
rural 
communities, and fishing grounds located on the Sinaloa coast, 
an extensive security system was established, in a coordinated 
manner, between federal and state police forces. 
  He added that PGR helicopters are flying over the roadways 
with the heaviest passenger and freight traffic, while 
checkpoints have been set up at the main intersections, 
supervised by agents from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office 
and representatives of human rights commissions. 
  He specified that, in the head-on effort to combat the drug 
traffic, 57 long-range and 167 short-range weapons have been 
seized, as well as 2,858 cartridges of various calibers. 
  He noted that 250 members of the Federal Judicial Police 
have 
been mobilized for this purpose, and that during the past four 
months 308 convictions have been ordered. Furthermore, there has 
been a 75-percent cut in the existing backlog of preliminary 
investigations. 
  The commander of the Eighth Naval Zone, stationed in 
Mazatlan, Zilli Viveros, in turn, declared: "The coastal 
surveillance operation is intended to support the PGR's action 
against the drug traffic, and will be maintained as long as is 
advisable." 
  He said that attention has also been given to reports 
claiming that shrimp boats are being used to move drugs. Hence, 
the activities include searches of suspected vessels in the area. 
  The commander of the Third Military Region, Jose Angel 
Garcia 
Elizalde, announced that 2,000 troops from the Task Force Mars 
operation, backed by Mexican Air Force and PGR aircraft, are 
remaining in the sierra zones and in the valleys, taking action 
to combat the drug traffic. 
  He commented that, during this time of the year, when the 
rainy season is about to begin, there is an increase in drug 
production. Hence, the troops are also intensifying their 
efforts to detect and destroy plantations, primarily those of 
poppies and marijuana. 
  Finally, Garcia Elizalde stressed: "The troops have 
succeeded 
in destroying a considerable number of drug crops, located on 
very high levels in the zone comprised of the converging 
mountain regions of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Durango."

<F P=106> [Article by Renato Davalos including an interview with Diego </F>
Valades Rios, attorney general of the republic; at the Zocalo, 5 
May 94] 
  [Text] The attorney general of the republic, Diego Valades 
Rios, claimed that the remand of Sergio Ortiz Lara, deputy 
attorney general of Baja California, "has no political 
background, and involves a legal matter." Declaring that this 
individual's responsibility will be proven, he also remarked 
that it cannot be claimed that a "narcoeconomy" or 
"narcopolitics" exists in Mexico. 
  When questioned about statements made by the PAN [National 
Action Party] governor, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the attorney 
general noted that, on 4 March, he had informed the state 
governor himself of the remand. "I, like all Mexicans, have 
confidence in the Federal Judicial Branch," he commented at the 
end of the oath-taking ceremony for the class of 1,975 draftees 
at the Zocalo yesterday. 
  Mr. Ortiz is responsible, and "this will be proven," 
declared 
Valades Rios. "And if he should not be culpable, the Judicial 
Branch will make the decision." However, "there is nothing 
political about the matter. I respect the governor, who is a PAN 
militant; I respect the nation's governors and all the political 
parties. Our only responsibility is to apply the law." 
  Davalos: Does it appear to be a power struggle, or 
not? 
  Valades: By no means; it has nothing to do with 
politics. It has been proven that Ortiz was on the site of the 
violent acts of 3 March. He has also been proven to have helped 
one of the drug traffickers, nicknamed "El Mayel," to escape. We 
shall verify that during the course of the trial, and it has 
nothing to do with politics. 
  He went on to say: "The governor, whom I respect and esteem 
personally, will surely agree with me that it is up to the 
Judicial Branch to decide what is fitting." 
  Davalos: Have you been in contact with the 
governor? 
  Valades: Yes, I have been in contact with the 
governor, expressing my respect for him, and telling him that I 
trust in the justice system, as he does. I am convinced that Mr. 
Ortiz is in collusion with drug traffickers, and I shall prove 
it. 
  Davalos: What is happening in Tijuana? Has it gone 
out of the government's control? 
  Valades: Tijuana's problem is something that we 
all deplore. Both the local and federal authorities are 
striving, and maintaining levels of cooperation that please me 
greatly. I have acknowledged this publicly. 
  Davalos: Could it be said that there is a 
"narcoeconomy" or "narcopolitics" in Mexico? 
  Valades: No, that is not the case. 
  Davalos: Isn't there any evidence that the 
financial system has been penetrated by the drug traffic? 
  Valades: That has not occurred by any means.

  [Text] Diego Valades, attorney general of the republic, 
gave notice that efforts in the battle against the drug traffic 
would be renewed, and that forceful action would be taken, 
according to instructions from the president of the republic. He 
added that there is an atmosphere of confidence in the 
institutions and the force of law in Mexico. 
  He also declared that the drug traffickers "are acting 
intensely," but claimed: "Our capacity for work, and our sense 
of organization and responsibility, will make it possible to 
achieve good results." 
  On a working tour of Sinaloa State, accompanied by the state 
governor, he emphasized that the department headed by him "has 
nothing to hide" regarding its policy for fighting the drug 
traffic. Calling it "the policy set by the Federal Executive 
Branch," he said that "there is also a commitment to inform the 
citizens with absolute clarity." 
  He expressed the view that the amendments to Articles 16, 
19, 
20, and 119 of the General Constitution of the Republic would 
make it possible to consolidate the prosecution of justice for 
the benefit of the citizens, adding that they expand the 
guarantees for those governed to a considerable extent. 
  During his visit to Sinaloa, the attorney general opened the 
first regional branch office of the National Institute To Combat 
Drugs, headed by commissioner Raul Campos Rabago. 
  There, he made an assessment of the battle against the drug 
trade, claiming Sinaloa to be one of the states in which this 
social cancer is being fought with the most intensity. He said 
that this is proven by the fact that, during the past four 
months of effort, as many drugs have been seized as during all 
of last year: 11 tons of marijuana. 
  He cited the need not only to observe some negative aspects 
of the battle against this illicit activity, but also to 
consider the positive side, such as the search for and 
procurement of sufficient material resources and human personnel 
to fight these criminals. 
  He remarked: "Thanks to the action that has been taken to 
counteract the drug traffic, the achievements have been positive 
from the standpoint of seizing drugs, as well as seizing both 
land and air transport vehicles."

  [Text] The principal commissioner of the French 
International Technical Service, Christopher Chaboud, 
acknowledged Mexico as an example for both Latin America and 
Europe in the battle against the drug traffic. He claimed that 
our country has one of the most modern laboratories in the field 
of expert and criminal investigation services on the American 
Continent. 
  During the course to update forensic chemical analysis of 
narcotics and psychotropic substances, given by specializing 
officials from the Attorney General's Office [PGR], the French 
researcher admitted that our country already has gained 
experience in this field. He noted, however, that since all 
nations have areas that should continue to be developed, an 
international records system on drugs, for example, might 
possibly be created. This would enable the various nations to 
compare statistical data and drug samples, so as to locate the 
centers for narcotics and psychotropic substances. 
  Addressing the PGR's general director of expert services, 
Miguel Oscar Aguilar Ruiz, and investigators from our country's 
various attorney generals' offices, Christopher Chaboud declared 
that Mexico has a vast knowledge and a history of its own 
regarding the investigation of, and the battle against the drug 
traffic. He said that, therefore, other nations should view its 
experience as an example. 
  He indicated that Europe has a different type of experience 
in this field, but admitted that, in any event, there is just 
one battle and the problem is the same internationally. Hence, 
exchanges of views and information will help to accrue better 
results in the fight against the drug traffic on all its levels. 
  Elsewhere in his remarks, the French official emphasized 
that 
Mexico and France have mutual cooperation agreements (the latest 
one ratified this year). Through them, both nations have 
promised to exchange information for the purpose of curbing the 
dreadful phenomenon of drug addiction and trafficking which, 
unfortunately, is afflicting the two countries. 
  He stressed that Mexico has a real, strong commitment to the 
rest of the world in this respect and, although admitting that 
each country has its own policy for fighting the drug traffic, 
he said that Mexico would continue to be an example in this area 
for both Latin America and Europe.

  [Text] Saltillo, Coahuila, 28 April--Thus far this year, 13 
tons of drugs have been seized on sites near this town: an 
amount representing a 350 percent increase over that for the 
same period in 1993. This announcement was made today by the 
agent from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF), Luis 
Ramon Balmori. 
  He made this statement after witnessing the incineration of 
four tons of cocaine confiscated a month ago, as well as three 
tons of marijuana seized in various operations by the Federal 
Highway and Ports Police and the Federal Judicial Police. 
  He declared that Coahuila now ranks first in drug 
confiscations, "because every week various amounts of narcotics, 
in most instances bound for the United States, are detected." 
  He noted that surveillance operations have been intensified 
on all highways and at foreign transport terminals, adding that 
even minors have been found being used by drug dealers to carry 
drugs to the border. The drug burning took place at the 
facilities of the Sixth Military Zone, in a ceremony headed by 
the PGR's [Attorney General's Office] state representative, 
Maria del Refugio Martinez.

  [Excerpt] Cocaine base and packed marijuana worth over 12 
billion new pesos, and intercepted by Judicial Police agents in 
Coahuila State, were incinerated yesterday by the Attorney 
General's Office [PGR] in the municipalities of Saltillo, 
Torreon, Ciudad Acuna, Piedras Negras, and Monclova. 
Furthermore, during operations conducted in Baja California, 
Sonora, Baja California Sur, Jalisco, and Nuevo Leon, the police 
authorities arrested six presumed public poisoners, seizing more 
than 2.5 tons of cannabis indica intended to be taken to the 
United States for sale and consumption. 
  The Attorney General's Office representative in Coahuila, 
Maria del Refugio Martinez Cruz, informed the assistant attorney 
for branch offices and inspections, Alfonso Cabrera Morales, 
that four tons and 182 kg of pure cocaine, and slightly over 
3,000 kg of packed marijuana, were burned. The incineration took 
place in the town of Saltillo, in the presence of 
representatives from the National Defense Secretariat, the 
Mexican Navy, and the health sector, as well as from state and 
municipal governments. 
  The official noted that, in the other aforementioned 
municipalities, various amounts of cannabis totaling seven tons 
and 825 kg were destroyed. They had been seized in operations 
conducted by Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel under 
orders from the force's deputy representative in the state, Juan 
Carlos Alvarado Aranda. 
  It was emphasized at the drug burning ceremonies that the 
authorities had confirmed their steadfast intention of pooling 
efforts so as, together, to combat society's common enemy: the 
drug traffic. 
  Moreover, the PGR representative in Sonora, Miguel Angel 
Cortes Ibarra, reported that federal agents under orders from 
the assistant representative, Julio Cesar Moraila Amador, had 
intercepted a trailer truck at the highway inspection point 
located at Km 120 of the Hermosillo-Nogales route. It was 
carrying 1,709 kg of pressed marijuana, presumably intended to 
be taken to the town of Nogales, Arizona, for marketing. 
  According to the report submitted to the PJF's General 
Directorate, headed by Commander Adrian Carrera Fuentes, Macario 
Ramirez Arcega was placed at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office. He was driving a vehicle with Federal 
Public Service registration 325-UBB. In the body of this vehicle 
203 packages and 64 bags containing the aforementioned amount of 
drugs were discovered. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Over 78 kg of pure cocaine with a market value 
exceeding 230 million new pesos were confiscated yesterday in 
the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco, by members of the Federal 
Judicial Police Counternarcotics Division. Two presumed public 
prisoners were arrested in the operation, considered "one of the 
most important carried out to date by the National Institute To 
Combat Drugs [INCD]." 
  Reports provided by the INCD, which is subordinate to the 
Attorney General's Office, reveal that Hermenegildo Vazquez 
Reynoso and Rutilo Larios Tovar were arrested in the underground 
parking lot of the Plaza Patria shopping center. They were 
engaged in closing a purchase and sale deal involving 78 kg and 
800 grams of the drug. 
  It was stated that the drugs, hidden in the false bottom of 
a 
pickup truck's platform, are thought to have been intended for 
shipment to Tijuana, Baja California, and subsequent smuggling 
into California for sale and consumption. 
  According to the department itself, and based on laboratory 
tests, the confiscated cocaine, distributed in several "bricks," 
had a high degree of purity. Hence, it was estimated that, after 
processing, its weight would have been increased up to 700 
percent; which would have netted the drug dealers sizable 
profits. 
  The authorities stressed that the capture of those now 
indicted and the drug confiscation "resulted from an extensive 
investigation." They added that it is being continued in both 
Jalisco and Baja California, to determine culpability, and 
whether those responsible belong to a group engaged in 
international narcotics trafficking. 
  It should be noted that, nearly a year after the 
aforementioned institute's creation, and although it has highly 
sophisticated technological equipment and agents who are 
graduates of the Attorney General's Office's own Training 
Institute, its results in the battle against the drug traffic 
have been minimal. For this reason, yesterday's confiscation is 
regarded as one of that institute's most important achievements.

  [Text] Upon arresting six presumed drug traffickers at the 
international airport in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and at the Oaxaca 
State capital airport, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] agents 
confiscated over 5 million pesos' worth of ephedrine, 
psychotropic pills, and white heroin. The latter was nearly 100 
percent pure, and sufficient to prepare 18,000 doses. 
  The representative of the Attorney General's Office [PGR] in 
Oaxaca, Manuel Figueroa Lange, announced that PJF personnel 
under orders from the deputy commissioner, Juan Jose Tafoya 
Gonzalez, arrested Erasmo Jesus Cruz Esperon, Jorge Efrain 
Garcia Cardoso, and Jose Antonio Varela Fuentes in the residence 
at Independencia and Garcia Vigil Streets, in the city of 
Oaxaca's first block. They had in their possession 260 grams of 
white or Thai heroin, considered by experts as one of the most 
toxic drugs on the narcotics market. 
  According to the report submitted to the PJF's general 
director, Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the accused were closing a 
deal for the purchase and sale of the drug, which, based on 
laboratory tests, was estimated as sufficient for processing 
18,000 doses. The authorities noted that the drug, of unknown 
origin, causes immediate addiction among those consuming it: 
hence the significance of the confiscation. 
  It was specified that the heroin was distributed in five 
packets, to be sold both in our country and the United States. 
The investigations to determine the origin of the narcotic are 
being continued. 
  For its part, the PGR branch office in Jalisco, headed by 
Raul Garza Serna, reported that Gabriel Rodriguez Cervantes and 
Jesus Herrera Lopez were captured at the Guadalajara 
international airport. They were carrying, in four suitcases, 
over 50.5 kg of ephedrine and several dozen psychotropic pills. 
The drugs were bound for Tijuana, Baja California. 
  It was added that the aforementioned persons were captured 
after the investigative agents had discovered on the inspection 
conveyor belts that the four bags contained a white, crystalline 
powder resembling cocaine. It proved to be ephedrine, a chemical 
precursor used for processing amphetamines and cocaine base. 
  At the same airport, during another search, Alejandro Ortiz 
Torres was arrested. He was carrying over 17 kg of compressed 
cocaine in a traveling bag, and was also bound for Tijuana.

  [Text] Morelia, Michoacan, 6 May--The Attorney General's 
Office [PGR] revealed today that Federal Judicial Police agents 
captured an individual with over a ton of marijuana in his 
possession, on the Los Reyes-Zamora highway. 
  The subject in custody is Enrique Calderon Duran, aged 45, a 
native of Apatzingan, employed as a taxi driver. He claimed to 
have received 500 new pesos for transporting the grass to Los 
Reyes. 
  The driver was carrying 144 packages of the drug, with a 
total weight of 1,012 kg, on a pickup truck, concealed under 
cattle hides intended for tanning. He said that he was supposed 
to deliver the merchandise to someone in Tierra Caliente. 
  The presumed drug trafficker was captured during a routine 
inspection on the aforementioned road, near the municipality of 
Jacona. The agents who discovered the drugs immediately arrested 
the subject, confiscating the packages and the pickup truck. 
  The PGR in Michoacan reported that the drugs and the subject 
in custody were left at the disposal of the Federal Public 
Prosecutor's Office, so that the pertinent interrogations could 
be conducted.

  [Text] Panama, 26 May (AFP) -- The U.S. proposal 
concerning uniform legislation to eliminate banking secrecy in 
Latin America "does not favor Panama's interests" because the 
country has enough laws to investigate money laundering 
activities, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Mulino said today. 
  The United States issued the proposal during a meeting with 
representatives of the Andean Pact countries (Bolivia, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), held on Tuesday and Wednesday in 
Bolivia to analyze the struggle against drug trafficking. 
  The U.S. Department of State representative, Paul Valky, 
said 
in Bolivia his country considers it essential to eliminate 
banking secrecy to struggle against drug trafficking. 
  According to Mulino, "Panama is a sovereign country which 
can 
decide whether it accepts making its legislation uniform with 
that of the United States and other countries, but we have more 
than enough laws to fight drug trafficking activities without 
endangering banking confidentiality." 
  The powerful international banking center in Panama is 
considered by the U.S. authorities to be an important center for 
laundering money resulting from drug trafficking activities. 
  Mulino asserted: "It is not true that banks in Panama are 
impenetrable concerning legal issues or that banking 
confidentiality is an absolute regime." Banking confidentiality 
"is penetrable" upon request from the legal authorities, when 
legal processes are properly carried out, he added. Mulino said 
Panama has signed the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) to 
fight drug trafficking with the United States, Colombia, 
England, and the Central American countries. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. Congress has yet to ratify the MLAT 
signed in 1992 with Panama, even though the Panamanian 
Legislative Assembly ratified the agreement, which allows 
authorities in different countries to exchange information about 
money laundering activities.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>
  [Text] Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria has asked all 
of the country's lawyers and members of the Supreme Court of 
Justice to establish something that was already done in 1991--to 
remove secrecy protection from corporations so that offenses can 
no longer be committed under this system. 
  His proposal was prompted by the scandal involving the 
Homsany Group, which the National Bank of Panama [BNP] and the 
Comptroller General's Office are accusing of stealing millions 
of balboas from the BNP. "We cannot let the secrecy of 
corporations serve to commit crimes," Comptroller Chen said. He 
said that in this particular case his office is using a 
precedent set by Panamanian law regarding corporations. 
  It would be up to the courts to determine if it is possible 
to remove the cover of secrecy from corporations, he said. 
  Regarding meddling by the Comptroller General's Office in 
this case, he said the office acted according to its 
responsibility and the law through the Directorate for the 
Recovery of State Property. 
  In those instances, the delegated District Attorney's Office 
continues gathering evidence, which clearly proves a crime was 
comitted. The Homsany Group is trying to evade justice by using 
the veil of corporations. 
  "I hope the courts will do their work and that the 
proofs--which are categorical--will be sufficient for justice to 
prevail in Panama." Chen Barria described what the Homsany 
Group did--using 38 companies to steal 5.6 million balboas--as 
detrimental to the BNP's funds, which belong to all Panamanians. 
  In fact, 33 out of these 38 companies were never in 
business, 
but their legal representatives and those who signed as loan 
debtors were employees earning between $200 and $250. "All of 
this shows a duly structured and planned crime," Chen Barria 
commented. 
  The companies involved in this crime are not operating, but 
the comptroller general revealed that the Homsany Group is 
running these companies under other corporations.

  [Text] At about 1700 yesterday, Dinar [National Narcotics 
Directorate] Intelligence Department agents, headed by Dinar 
Director Inspector Publio Fretes, retired, and legally supported 
by Judge Angel Barchini, raided a house at 1937 Mariscal Lopez 
Avenue near President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's residence. 
  The antinarcotics agents thoroughly checked the house with 
the assistance of super [drug-sniffing] dog "Flyn." The dog 
went to a desk in the living room and found three packages 
containing white powder. A "narcotest" confirmed that the 
powder was cocaine hydrochloride (pure cocaine). The packages 
weighed three kg. The agents continued checking the house and 
discovered two .22-caliber rifles, one with a telescopic sight; 
one 7.65-caliber pistol; and one .38-caliber revolver. They 
also discovered $3,500 in allegedly counterfeit bills. 
  The occupant, identified as Roque Maximo Villalba Acevedo, 
31, a married Paraguayan citizen, and his uncle, Wellington 
Acevedo, also a married Paraguayan citizen, were immediately 
detained. Judge Barchini ordered the detention of the two 
alleged traffickers who were taken to the Dinar headquarters 
where they are being held incommunicado. 
  The detainees were talking with two Automotor company 
employees who reportedly went to the house to collect 
installments on seven Hyundai cars that the traffickers 
reportedly purchased about one month ago. The employees were 
released as the judge believe they are not involved in the 
affair whatsoever. 
  The cache, worth almost 100 million guaranies, was allegedly 
shipped by the Santa Cruz Cartel and was allegedly to be 
marketed in our country by the detainees. This raid was not 
easy for the Dinar agents due to the strategic location of the 
"traffickers" house. 
  A second raid, also linked to this case, was carried out at 
a 
building near the intersection of 3 de Noviembre Street and 
Eusebio Ayala Avenue, specifically at the "Villalba Avalos Real 
Estate Company." Maximo Wenceslao Villalba Fernandez, 37, the 
office manager, was interrogated. The office was allegedly 
being used by the "traffickers" for their commercial operations. 
Not a trace of drugs was discovered in the office. 
  To crown the Dinar-legal raid, a lady, allegedly the mother 
of other stock holders of the company, entered the office and 
began a heated argument with another relative over the situation.

  [Text] Police Superintendent Juan Angel Aguero, chief of 
the Narcotics Department of the National Police, has warned that 
cocaine trafficking has grown by remarkable proportions in our 
country. He added that this information is based on the latest 
seizures of the valuable yet illegal merchandise in our country. 
  Aguero said: "There is a noticeable increase that is easy to 
detect in the latest drug seizures," adding that cocaine 
trafficking in Paraguay has grown considerably. 
  Aguero noted that drug seizures were smaller than the latest 
seizures, especially those made so far this year. 
  Aguero added: "The trade is growing and cocaine trafficking 
is flourishing. We have no information on a group of cocaine 
addicts in Paraguay, but we know we are on the drug route. 
Trafficking has grown in Paraguay." 
  Aguero said that the work by the National Narcotics 
Directorate (Dinar) and by the Narcotics Department of the 
National Police has been successful. 
  "Dinar has in a few weeks confiscated more cocaine than the 
total confiscated in an entire year," Aguero said to prove his 
remarks. 
  According to National Antinarcotics Secretariat (Senad) 
information, 34,200 grams of high-purity cocaine from the 
Bolivian cartel of Santa Cruz de la Sierra was seized in April 
and May. 
  Normally, cocaine seizures amount to only a few kilos per 
year, Senad sources said. 
  Aguero said mobile laboratories for producing cocaine have 
not yet been detected in our country. 
  "There were reports that a border `mini-cartel' had a 
cocaine-producing laboratory in the Chaco or in the town of 
Pedro Juan Caballero, but so far we have been unable to confirm 
anything but drug trafficking." 
  The police official said the cocaine issue could be serious, 
considering the ratio accepted worldwide between the quantity of 
drugs seized and the volume that reaches its illegal market. 
  "If we consider the accepted worldwide ratio, it may become 
a 
concern. Only 20 percent is being confiscated, while 80 percent 
reaches its destination. It is difficult to seize more," he 
said. 
  "This means that if 50 kg is seized, it represents only 20 
percent of the entire shipment. Traffickers are getting most of 
the shipment to its destination," the police official said. 
  Aguero added that recent cocaine seizures prove "there is an 
excess of narcotics. We must optimize our work, uniting 
security organization forces in the drug enforcement effort."

  [Text] Lima, 25 May (EFE) -- Peruvian military planes have 
intercepted two small Colombian planes in the department of 
Ucayali, in the Peruvian jungle, forcing them to land, police 
sources reported today. 
  The two small planes, which were intercepted by Peruvian Air 
Force [FAP] planes, landed at an illegal airstrip in the Boca 
Apua zone and were set on fire by the crew, after which the 
alleged drug traffickers escaped into the jungle. 
  Military troops and two judges later went to the illegal 
airstrip and destroyed it, the sources said. 
  The illegal airstrips in the Peruvian jungle are used for 
the 
landing and takeoff of light planes from the Colombian drug 
"cartels," which pick up cocaine base shipments produced by 
Peruvian drug trafficking gangs.

  [Text] According to agents of the National Antidrug 
Division (Dinandro), the drug trafficking organizations that 
operate in the Upper Huallaga and in the outskirts of the jungle 
in Ayacucho are reportedly operating behind businesses, mostly 
battery factories, which they use to get tonnes of precursors to 
make cocaine base and cocaine hydrochloride. 
  Experts and chemists of Dinandro's Division of Research and 
Control of Chemicals said that the sulfuric acid reportedly used 
by about 37 small shops and battery factories in Huancayo does 
not reflect the number of products they put on the market. 
  According to police calculations, these industries buy an 
average of 70 tonnes of sulfuric acid, which is essential for 
making drugs, every month. With that amount they could make at 
least 45,000 batteries. Their production is, however, no more 
than 444 batteries. 
  Dinandro came to the conclusion that 80 percent of the 
sulfuric acid bought by some of these factories is sent to the 
narcotics labs located in Palmapampa (Ayacucho) and in the Upper 
Huallaga. 
  They explained that the drug cartels have studied the 
geographic location of Huancayo, which has a permanent 
transportation flow between the capital, the central mountain 
range, and the jungle, and have made this their nerve center for 
the supply of precursors for their labs making cocaine base and 
cocaine. 
<H5>  Fooling the Authorities </H5>
  One of the ways of evading police control is to declare 
their 
companies bankrupt after having made large purchases of 
precursors for three or four months or, in some cases, almost 
six months. 
  Thus, after having bought at least some 100 or 120 tonnes of 
sulfuric acid, and having profited during this period of time by 
no less than $100,000 in business with the Upper Huallaga and 
Palmapampa "companies," they declare that they have gone 
bankrupt, and destroy their accounting and purchase books, thus 
preventing the use made of the precursors from being 
investigated. 
  There have been cases, however, in which from the same line 
of business--battery manufacturing plants--they obtain more 
permits in the names of their wives, children, and relatives, 
who agree to join the game. 
  They also go to the police precincts to report losses of 
sulfuric acid in transport, and that 60 to 70 percent of the 
tonnes being transported had been lost as a result of leaks in 
the containers. 
  Recently they have been stating that less concentrated 
sulfuric acid (with a 1.25 density) is sold as "battery liquid" 
in settlements in which batteries are used because they have no 
electricity. 
<H5>  Demanding Exemption </H5>
  Recently, the Huancayo battery manufacturers have asked the 
Industry, Tourism and Integration Ministry to declare the 
Verification Act void. 
  Dinandro experts and chemists assert that this request will 
benefit the drug trafficking cartels and their suppliers because 
they can thus obtain the precursors without any difficulty, and 
will be able to increase the amount of cocaine and cocaine base 
production. 
  According to Dinandro sources this would be enormously easy, 
as the regional office of the Industry, Tourism and Integration 
Ministry has no trained employees to evaluate the precursors and 
control them.

  [Text] The terrorists who attacked an Army helicopter in 
Quebrada Pena Blanca (Chanchamayo) on 12 May may be members of 
an MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] column that 
protects some five "firms" of drug traffickers operating on the 
outskirts of the jungle in that region. 
  This was asserted by Interior Ministry intelligence sources, 
according to which the terrorists allegedly come from San Luis 
de Shuaro. 
  The terrorists belong to one of the MRTA columns that have 
lost their slight ideological tint, and are surviving as a 
mercenary group protecting a Mexican "firm" that is allegedly 
trying to grow poppy plants in the surroundings of Sanchirio, 
Alto Batinaki, Santa Herminia, and on the banks of the 
Paucartambo River near Villa Rica. 
  This, however, is not the only organization of foreign drug 
traffickers: Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers operate in 
the region in cahoots with Peruvian traffickers. 
  Intelligence experts maintain that this MRTA column, and 
those located on the outskirts of the Satipo (Junin) and 
Oxapampa (Pasco) jungle, enjoy the compulsory help of peasant 
and indigenous communities, whose leaders and heads of family 
are forced, under threats of death, to cultivate coca leaf, 
marijuana, and poppies. 
  They are also forced to produce washed cocaine paste, which 
provides the MRTA with a significant income. 
  According to information obtained from peasants in Villa 
Rica, 500 kg of washed cocaine paste are shipped to Colombia 
each week. This represents an income per shipment for the 
terrorists of approximately $225,000, taking into account that 
the drugs are sold at $1,800 per kilo and the terrorists collect 
25 percent of the total amount. 
  As for the "political military" organization of that 
terrorist group, the analysts believe that the MRTA Central 
Regional Committee has lost its geographical domain. In other 
words, it no longer has the same control it used to exercise in 
Pasco and Junin, and only survives due to its link with drug 
traffickers. 
  Another source of income is allegedly the protection fees 
the 
MRTA members charge merchants, businessmen, and passengers 
travelling through San Francisco, Esperanza, Miraflores, and 
Villa Rica in Oxapampa (Pasco).

  [Text] Arrest warrants have been issued against four 
alleged members of the Medellin Cartel, who were recently 
detained by the National Guard. The arrest warrants were issued 
against four alleged perpetrators of drug trafficking based on 
Article 33 on the Basic Law on Drugs and Psychotropic Substances 
and on Article 83 of the Penal Code. The arrest warrants were 
issued via the 48th Court and the First Criminal District of the 
Caracas Metropolitan Judicial District, which is headquartered 
in Los Cortijo de Lourdes. 
  Reportedly, this particular branch of the Medellin Cartel is 
using this nation as a bridge for drug trafficking to Europe and 
North America. Colonel Jairo Casimiro Coronel Figueroa, 
National Guard director of efforts against drug trafficking, 
identified the detained suspects as Ruben Dario Pelais Munera, 
German Perez Zapata, [name indistinct], and Luis Fernando 
Martinez. Meanwhile, [words indistinct] Carlos San Vincens 
Clavera were released. These last two had been detained for 
questioning. It was also learned that these four individuals 
will remain at the Judicial Detention Center in Las Flores,

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Caught red-handed"] </F>
  [Text] There is fresh evidence that the Khun Sa group is 
very much active [in] refining opium, producing its most deadly 
derivative, heroin, which eventually finds its way to capitals 
of countries where the perpetrator of drug-related problems 
still finds allies, for obvious reasons. 
  Acetic anhydride, the most potent of precursor chemicals in 
the refining process, was on its way in bulk toward the 
tri-border area where the rogue has his den when a lightning 
raid by the Tatmadaw [Defense Services] sent the caravan people 
running for dear life. The chemicals, in 126 plastic containers, 
measure over 3,333 liters. Calculating in terms of what those 
familiar with the process say, the end product would be 3,333 
kilos of pure white heroin. 
  Where would the miscreant dispatch that much of lethal 
powder? Wherever there is demand. That is why the government 
here is pushing for demand reduction while striking at the root. 
The interdiction of the chemical caravan also left 62 
packsaddles in the hands of the law enforcers. Plain reasoning 
will help deduce that there were in the trail 62 pack 
horses/mules. Knowing they must jettison their precious 
contraband in order to save their lives, Khun Sa's men had taken 
to mule-back riding, which they would not have done under normal 
circumstances. Moreover, they had not crossed the Thanlwin 
[Salween] and were still far from where they were holed out. 
  There were earlier occasions, as divulged yesterday, when 
similar chemical contraband was seized, meaning the law 
enforcement personnel were able to deprive the refineries of the 
most essential element. From time to time, opium and various 
other forms of opiates and even psychotropic substances which 
were seized through Tatmadaw and police checks were destroyed in 
the presence of local and foreign newsmen, diplomats, and other 
guests. 
  There are times when the wholesale producer of heroin is 
portrayed as hero by the Western media. Seldom is he made a 
villain. The way we in Myanmar [Burma] see it, those like him 
who perpetrate such atrocities against humanity must be 
villains. Anyone with enough sense in his head would not bother 
to argue on his behalf. Plainly put, a drug man, and those who 
lend that person support of any measure, must be treated as 
intent on and actually doing harm to society worldwide. Caught 
red-handed. Indicted.

  [Text] A Tatmadaw [Defense Services] column of the Eastern 
Command, acting on information, seized 3333.96 litres of acetic 
anhydride, used in refining heroin, from about 60 members of 
Khun Sa's SURA [Shan United Revolutionary Army] armed group 
after a 20-minute engagement with them on 13 May near Wunlon 
Village in Loilem Township. 
  The acid was in 126 containers. 
  The Tatmadaw column also impounded 62 pack-saddles from the 
armed group which fled in disarray after the battle. The seized 
acid is believed to be destined for opium refineries of Khun 
Sa's armed group, which are situated on the Myanmar 
[Burma]-Thailand border. 
  Acetic anhydride is an essential element in refining heroin. 
A kilo or a litre of the liquid is needed for producing a kilo 
of heroin. 
  Over 4,000 litres of acetic anhydride were also seized 
together with culprits from a truck which parked at Yayayekwin 
Ward, Taunggyi on 15 November last year. The acid was on its 
way to refineries of Khun Sa's Loimaw armed group, notorious for 
their drug trafficking and opium refining, which is their main 
business. 
  A Tatmadaw column of Eastern Command while on security duty 
also seized another 415.8 litres and nine horses and mules from 
a caravan on 5 December 1992 when they found a group of 
smugglers heading for the border near Narpaw Village in Kengtung 
Township. 
  The Tatmadaw and People's Police Force members are exposing 
and arresting drug smugglers who are trying to transport 
precursor chemicals to Khun Sa's SUA [Shan United Army]-SURA 
group who are selling their refined heroin on international drug 
market.

  [Text] Heavy fighting continued between Khun Sa's army and 
Burmese troops in Shan State close to the Thai border. 
According to a recent report, Burma sent 10 battalions more of 
reinforcements in an attempt to retake Mong Chot. 
  A reliable source reported to MATICHON on 23 May that, 
during 
the night of 22 May, 10 battalions of the 23d brigade, with its 
stronghold west of the Salween River and about eight kilometers 
from Mong Chot, mounted an offensive against Khun Sa's soldiers 
and managed to take back the military stronghold at Mong Chot at 
dawn on 23 May. There was no report on the casualties of both 
sides, but Khun Sa's men reportedly pulled back from Mong Chot 
toward Doi Na Mu and Doi Nam Cham. 
  As for the situation in Chiang Mai, MATICHON's correspondent 
reported intense fighting at the border in Wiang Haeng, Mae Ai, 
and Fang Districts in Chiang Mai. There was also fierce 
fighting opposite Muang District of Mae Hong Son Province, about 
10 kilometers from the Thai-Burmese border, with the two sides 
pounding artillery fire on each other continuously. 
  The source reported that Khun Sa's troops advanced toward 
Thachilek-Napong and, in the past two days, launched three 
attacks on Burmese Government troops, killing and wounding many. 
They apparently wanted to capture Thachilek. The Burmese 
border pass at Thachilek opposite Mae Sai in Chiang Rai was 
closed, as the Burmese military was recruiting men to be porters 
and soldiers. It also wanted to black out news about the 
situation in Burma to keep it from leaking to the Thai side. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Kansai Chaiyen, a leading member of the Shan 
State Restoration Council, said the Burmese Government proposed 
a cease-fire negotiation after three weeks of fighting. Burma 
claimed that several factions of Khun Sa's army had already 
agreed to a cease-fire negotiation. However, the Shan State 
Restoration Council made it clear that there would be a 
negotiation only when Burmese troops had pulled out from Shan 
State, and that the negotiation be conducted in a country other 
than Burma.

  [Excerpt] More than a thousand porters are being used by 
the Burmese army in fighting against Khun Sa's Shan forces, 
according to porters who recently escaped to the border of 
northern Chiang Mai province. 
  The porters fled three days ago to the Thai border through 
the jungle from Mong Kyawt, the base north of Piang Luang 
recaptured a week ago by Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army Forces. 
  One of the porters, a Burmese construction worker from 
Rangoon, said he had been captured in the street in Keng Tung 
two months earlier and was then trucked with 80 others to work 
for the State Law and Order Restoration Council's (Slorc) 
Battalion 245 at Mong Kyawt. 
  He said Battalion 245 alone was using about 150 porters. An 
estimated 10 battalions have been deployed by the Slorc in the 
Mong Kyawt area. 
  Two of the porters, Shan farmers, had been captured only a 
week previously from their homes in Mong Hsat, 100 km northeast 
of Mong Kyawt. They said new groups of porters were being 
trucked in from different parts of Shan State. 
  The porters were made to carry heavy loads of ammunition and 
rice for the soldiers. They described how soldiers beat those 
unable to carry on walking. 
  "Four porters in my group died of diarrhea," said one 
porter. 
"I thought I would die if I did not escape." The porters had 
run away at night. Their clothes were ragged and they had cuts 
and sores from running through the jungle. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Up to 50,000 Burmese have fled to Thailand to 
escape the current offensive by the Burmese Army against the 
forces of drug warlord Khun Sa, according to Khachatphai 
Burutphat, deputy secretary-general of the National Security 
Council. 
  Khachatphai said, however, the fighting is not as fierce as 
that by the Burmese government against Karen forces. 
  "I expect Khun Sa's people escaped to Chiang Mai and Mae 
Hong 
Son Provinces. However, the authorities are prepared to deal 
with the problems that may arise", he said. 
  Khachatphai also said that Thailand would take care of and 
assist the refugees on humanitarian grounds. But they would be 
sent back to Burma as soon as the situation has improved. 
  He added that the authorities are able to ensure security 
for 
people living in the troubled border area. 
  Asked to comment on whether the U.S. government is to 
provide 
assistance for the Burmese government to battle Khun Sa's 
troops, Khachatphai said the Council had not yet learned if the 
United States would support the Burmese forces. 
  Also, Khachatphai said the fighting is aimed at cracking 
down 
on the production and trafficking of drugs by Khun Sa.

  [Text] The use of drugs has become an important matter 
facing a Cambodian society which does not yet understand its 
economic implications. 
  In the last seven months, there has been speculation that 
unscrupulous groups are providing illegal drugs to some men and 
women in Phnom Penh, but it has been very difficult to get good 
evidence about this activity. 
  This is a major problem which the royal government and 
appropriate ministries should pay close attention to and have a 
strategy for dealing with. 
  Even though the source of information about the use of drugs 
is vague, these unscrupulous groups cannot avoid the fine net 
cast by the authorities. It is clear that the Criminal Police 
of the Ministry of the Interior have been making arrests 
continuously since the beginning of March including members of a 
Vietnamese gang which has been involved in illegal drug dealing 
in the Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward right in front of the Bung Trabek 
School in Chamkar Mon District; we reported this on 7 March. 
This is the very first fruit of the Cambodian police in their 
suppression of people involved in the illicit use of drugs which 
in the past we have only heard about in stories on foreign 
videos. 
  It is still not known how many people make a living through 
the illicit distribution of drugs or where these people are. It 
is a difficult problem which must be carefully investigated. 
Therefore this event can serve to frighten parents and 
guardians into taking care to educate their children to keep 
them from falling into this kind of disaster. 
  If the use of drugs really does increase and spread through 
the country it will topple Cambodia into another new disaster 
which, it can now be seen, is the deadliest "virus" for the 
society comparable to AIDS. 
  A real problem is that in Cambodia Drug Eradication 
Committees have probably not yet been organized. 
  Regarding the question what result would come from the use 
of 
drugs, Dr. Ti Chhun Eng, an official in the Ministry of Health, 
said that the danger in the use of drugs is that it could lead 
the great difficulties. 
  Once someone gets involved with drugs, that person will 
continue to use them. When that person cannot obtain drugs, 
he/she cannot do anything because it causes a severe condition 
similar to drunkenness or opium intoxication. When a person is 
hooked on drugs it is not easy to get him/her off of drugs. 
  According to some, the use of drugs makes the person brave 
and happy and easily controlled by another person. The use of 
drugs by young women makes them sexually aroused. 
  This is really a tough problem. They get used to being happy 
and brave...they live together. This is the way it is with drug 
addicts; they cannot stop (like people who are alcoholics or 
smokers) whenever drugs are available. 
  Dr. Ti Chhun Eng stated that we cannot say that drugs can 
make a person brave. The first step is only to get people to 
try drugs. Once people are addicted he/she can be ordered to do 
something. If the drug addict cannot do what he/she is ordered 
to do, they will not give him/her any drugs. 
  So drug addicts must carry out their orders successfully in 
order to earn their drugs.

  [Text] A group of Vietnamese who have been involved with 
illegal drugs have been arrested by the Criminal Police of the 
Ministry of the Interior in Doeum Thkov Market Ward right in 
front of the Beng Trabek School in Chamkar Mon District. 
  In activities against this use of drugs, a high level force 
of the Criminal Police arrested three Vietnamese illegal drug 
users and seized a 20 ml. bottle of drugs on 3 March at 1700. 
  According to a statement by Mr. Chey Ritthi, the deputy 
chairman of the High Level Office of Criminal Affairs at 0800 
the following day, 4 March this High Level Criminal Police Force 
conducted operations in this area and arrested a Vietnamese 
named Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh who collaborated with his wife to 
provide intravenous drugs. At that time the authorities 
confiscated a number of pieces of evidence: seven packages of 
opium power No. 4, a can of cotton impregnated with drugs for 
rubbing or sniffing, four hypodermic syringes, approxiametly 10 
ml. of drugs, a number of ampules of diazepam and prometazine 
made in China, and a number of hypodermic needles. 
  People who know say that the drug problem became very active 
in South Vietnam when the American soldiers arrived. Later, the 
Vietnamese communist government made a show of strongly 
suppressing this problem, but without much success. The 
Vietnamese drug addicts who use these drugs call them "si ke" in 
Vietnamese. In Cambodia prior to this the use of drugs in this 
way has not been confirmed by any source. So this should be a 
sign for the appropriate ministries and for the people in 
general. 
  Din Tieng Ngoc Vang, a woman aged 33 born in Hau Giang 
Province, Vietnam and currently living in an unnumbered house in 
front of the Beng Trabek School in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward 
admitted to the High Level Criminal Police, "I have been earning 
a living giving intravenous drugs for the past five months. 
During the five days before I was arrested, I ceased taking 
intravenous drugs because I feared being arrested by the 
authorities and I didn't dare buy any more drugs. I changed 
from injecting drugs to taking them orally or applying them by 
rubbing (rubbing them on the skin or on wounds) and sniffing 
them." 
  Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she had known how to take 
intravenous drugs since her first marriage, but her first 
husband later went insane and returned to Vietnam. 
  Din Tieng Ngoc Vang admitted that she bought these drugs 
from 
an old man about 70 years old whose name she did not know and 
that he brought them from Vietnam in 1 chi lots (equals a little 
less than 4 grams) worth 6,000 riels. 
  Each day Din Tieng Ngoc Vang provided illegal drugs giving 
injections to at least six or seven addicts. 
  Responding to the question when had he started using drugs, 
a 
Vietnamese man named Ha Hung Ung, age 35, a native of An Giang, 
Long Xieng Province, Vietnam, employed as a carpentar in Phsar 
Doeum Thkov Ward recently admitted that, "I have been an 
intravenous drug user for perhaps more than one month. At first 
I got injections from an old woman whose name I don't know. 
Then I got them from Din Tieng Ngoc Vang a.k.a. Sieng. I took 
intravenous drugs once a day. At the beginning my friends got 
me hooked. Now I am addicted to opium and I have to use drugs 
every day. If I don't get a fix, I feel terrible." 
  Ha Hung Ung added that, "On 3 March at 1700 I was just about 
to inject drugs when suddenly the police arrived and arrested me 
and brought me here (the Ministry of the Interior)." 
  Ha Hung Ung's partner who, according to him, is called "A 
Tung," is a worse drug addict than him. A Tung is also a 
Vietnamese. This opium addict with heavily lidded eyes and who 
constantly drools annoyed the High Level Criminal Police Force 
because he would not admit to any of their accusations. 
  Sar Van Kha a.k.a. Thanh, a male age 28 a native of Ba Dinh, 
Hanoi, Vietnam first lived at house No. 105 Borikeyla 7th of 
January District when he came to Cambodia, but he later moved to 
the Beng Trabek area to a new house in Phsar Doeum Thkov Ward. 
He worked as a runner crossing the border from Cambodia to 
Vietnam and buying stolen motorcycles. 
  A police investigation revealed that Sar Van Kha a.k.a. 
Thanh 
was a sapper for the Hanoi communist government which had 
discharged him, but when arrested by the police he had a Human 
Rights Card [as published] which had been issued by the LICADO 
Organization. 
  Responding about his arrest for conspiracy together with his 
wife in the illicit distribution of drugs, Sar Van Kha a.k.a. 
Thanh admitted that, "the drugs that the authorities took away 
on the morning of 4 March 1994 were my wife, Din Tieng Ngoc 
Vang's, drugs, but I don't know where she bought them." 
  The High Level Criminal Police are building a case against 
these four Vietnamese who are involved in the use and 
distribution of illegal drugs in order to send it to court and 
punish them according to the laws in effect. 
  This is the very first success of the Cambodian police in 
the 
suppression of people involved in the illegal use of drugs which 
in the past we only heard stories about in Hong Kong videos.

  [Text] According to an informal estimate by the Bureau of 
Investigation, roughly 400,000 people use narcotics in Taiwan. 
Narcotics analysts in the bureau's Sixth Department say the 
1,300 kg of heroin seized during all of last year is sufficient 
to supply more than 32,000 users for an entire year. And since 
the amount seized is conservatively estimated to equal only 
one-tenth of total circulation, the number of narcotic consumers 
in Taiwan extrapolates to roughly 400,000. 
  Bureau narcotics specialists say that a heroin user needs 
only about 0.1 g a day of the most refined form of the drug to 
satisfy his craving, greater use might be fatal, so a user 
consumes only about 40 g a year. Therefore, the 1,300 kg seized 
by public security organs last year is enough to supply 32,500 
users for an entire year. 
  Nevertheless, most drug-bust suspects are by no means 
first-timers, admitting involvement in many "deals." Therefore, 
Sixth Department researchers point out, the amount of narcotics 
seized by public security units equals about only one-tenth of 
the total in circulation. Indeed, this estimate is in fact 
derived from conclusions reached by the U.S. Government from 
studies of drug seizures and actual trafficking in the United 
States. Our country's war on drugs is less effective than 
America's in terms of manpower, equipment, and funding, so 
"one-tenth" may well be an overestimate of our effectiveness in 
this endeavor. 
  Extrapolating thus, the amount of narcotics circulating in 
our country is enough to supply roughly 325,000 users for an 
entire year. And, given the principle of market supply and 
demand, there clearly must be more than 320,000 users for there 
to be such a flood of drugs into our country. 
  Are all our narcotics consumed domestically, or is there 
transshipment abroad? As to this, bureau drug agents note that 
no case of transshipment has ever been discovered, our customs 
officials are very rigorous in their search for drugs, so it is 
better for traffickers to use neighboring Southeast Asian 
countries, where the risk of losing one's entire investment is 
lower than Taiwan for transshipment. 
  Sixth Department researchers point out that using seizure 
totals to estimate user populations is crude, informal, and 
inaccurate; but that precise figures for those populations are 
very difficult to obtain and accurate surveys are impossible; so 
that there is no choice but to resort to such crude estimation.

  [Text] Opposition lawmakers on the House committee 
monitoring MPs' conduct yesterday accused the United States 
Information Service (USIS) of acting in collusion with the Thai 
Foreign Ministry to smear the name of Chat Phatthana MP Mongkhon 
Chongsutthanamani. 
  According to USIS, the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok on March 18 
rejected Mongkhon's application for a U.S. entry visa on the 
grounds that he was suspected of involvement in drug trafficking 
by U.S. law enforcement authorities. 
  "Everybody on the House committee on parliamentary affairs 
agreed that USIS was apparently in great haste and gave 
confusing statements regarding the rejection of Mongkhon's visa 
application," said MP Phairot Suwanchawi (Chat Phatthana-Nakhon 
Ratchasima). 
  Phairot, a member of the House committee, claimed that the 
U.S. Embassy informed Mongkhon that it could not issue an entry 
visa to him because he had not submitted all necessary 
documentation on February 28. 
  "The USIS statement said the U.S. Embassy rejected his visa 
application on March 18. How can the embassy reject the visa 
application on March 18 when Mongkhon did not re-submit his 
application at that time?" the Chat Phatthana MP said. 
  There apparently was a misunderstanding on the part of 
opposition lawmakers as a copy of a notification dated Feb 28 
issued by the U.S. Embassy informed Mongkhon that he was 
ineligible at that time for the entry visa because his 
application was still "pending necessary administrative 
processing". 
  Therefore, it appears no irregularities were involved when, 
after consulting the US law enforcement authorities, the embassy 
on March 18 rejected Mongkhon's visa application on the grounds 
of suspected drug trafficking activities. 
  Copies of the U.S. Embassy notification, written in English, 
were given to reporters yesterday by some members of the House 
committee. 
  Phairot said the House committee also decided that the 
government should devise measures to prevent people from 
accusing others of serious crimes without supplying evidence to 
back up the charges. 
  He also said Mongkhon, who testified before the House 
committee without being summoned, announced that he was willing 
to travel to the United States if the U.S. Embassy here arranged 
for his journey. 
  "Khun Mongkhon said he was prepared to go to the United 
States even if he would be arrested by U.S. authorities upon 
arrival," Phairot said. 
  MP Witthaya Thianthong (Chat Thai-Sa Kaeo), also a member of 
the House committee, said USIS must have colluded with the 
Foreign Ministry to damage Mongkhon's reputation. 
  "USIS must have been given a cue from the Foreign Ministry. 
The whole thing is politics between the coalition government 
and the opposition," Witthaya said. 
  He acknowledged that some coalition government MP's on the 
House committee did not agree with the opposition lawmakers' 
theory. 
  The House committee chairman, Charoen Khanthawong (Democrat- 
Bangkok), said the House committee did not make any decision as 
to what to do with Mongkhon's case. 
  Charoen said opposition MP's on the panel claimed there were 
irregularities in the way USIS handled Mongkhon's case but 
several other members disagreed. 
  "Some members claimed that USIS was interfering in Thai 
politics, while others disagreed," the chairman said. 
  Charoen said the House committee had sought more information 
regarding Mongkhon's case from the U.S. Embassy but was told 
that any request must go through the Foreign Ministry. 
  The House committee has yet to conclude its investigation 
into the case of former MP Thanong Siriprichaphong (Chat 
Thai-Nakhon Phanom), who resigned from the Chat Thai Party last 
Saturday and who subsequently lost his House membership. 
  Thanong has been charged in the United States with smuggling 
into that country more than 45 metric tons of marijuana between 
1973- 1987. Thanong's assets in the United States--a Beverly 
Hills house and a Mercedes Benz--have been seized under a US 
court order.

  It has now been revealed how Democrat MP Somkhit Nuanphian 
knew so much about a proclaimed U.S. blacklist of Thai 
politicians suspected of involvement in the drug trade. 
  "He told me he got that information when he worked for the 
KGB," said Democrat Thanin Chaisamut, referring to the Central 
Intelligence Agency's rival in the former Soviet empire. 
  Thanin appeared serious. 
  Asked if Somkhit remained a Soviet spy, Thanin replied, "Not 
any more. The Soviet Union has crumbled." 
  Somkhit triggered the Opposition's outburst when he followed 
up on Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's statement that many 
Thai politicians were blacklisted due to suspicion that they 
were involved in narcotics smuggling. During a tumultuous House 
debate, opposition MPs demanded Somkhit, who was not in the 
chamber, to reveal names and disclose the source of his 
information. 
  Thanin said he tried to avoid Somkhit. 
  "I don't walk with him any longer. There's nothing except 
that I'm afraid I'll be caught in the cross-fire if somebody 
tries to silence him," Thanin said.

  [Text] Chat Phatthana MP for Chiang Rai Mongkhon 
Chongsuthamani yesterday threatened to file defamation lawsuits 
against the American Embassy and the Foreign Ministry or 
Minister Prasong Sunsiri for allegedly linking him with the 
narcotics trade. 
  Mr Mongkhon said before leaving for his home province in the 
morning that he would study what legal aspects could be used 
against those who damaged his reputation. 
  He and other Opposition MP's have been angered by reports 
that Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong told last week's Cabinet 
meeting that 17 Opposition MP's were suspected by the U.S. of 
involvement in illicit drug businesses and that three of them 
were denied entry visas to the US. 
  A Cabinet source quoted Sqn Ldr Prasong as naming Mr 
Mongkhon 
as one of the three MP's whose visa applications were rejected. 
  The foreign minister, however, denied that at the Cabinet 
meeting he had identified any drug suspects or those whose U.S. 
visas were refused. 
  Mr Mongkhon tearfully told the House on Thursday that he had 
never been involved in drug trafficking and had never been told 
by the United States Embassy that a visa which was issued to him 
in 1991 could not be used now. 
  The United States Information Services on Friday issued a 
statement saying there was "reason to believe" that Mr Mongkhon 
was involved in the drugs trade, therefore his visa was denied 
under the Immigration and Nationality Act. 
  According to the statement, the Chiang Rai MP had been told 
in writing why he was ineligible for a visa. 
  Mr Mongkhon, however, repeatedly denied yesterday that he or 
anyone at his house had ever received such a letter from the 
embassy. There was no evidence to prove the letter had been 
sent to his house. 
  "I was surprised why that letter never reached me although I 
have my address here." 
  He asked the news media to help trace that letter for him. 
  "The news media should ask for proof (that the letter was 
sent to Mr Mongkhon) from the embassy." 
  According to Mr Mongkhon, the embassy told him the visa 
could 
not be issued because it needed a few more documents but did not 
say anything about suspected drug involvement. 
  Mr Mongkhon said he could not say whether the embassy was 
giving false evidence but wondered why the news had just been 
revealed during a time of rising conflict between the Government 
and the Opposition. 
  He said he believed the drug allegations against him were 
politically motivated, accusing the Government of trying to get 
the upper hand on the Opposition after senators and Opposition 
parties turned down its draft constitution amendment bills last 
month. 
  "The embassy should have informed me in February or March 
when the visa application was rejected. I do not understand why 
everything has just happened now," Mr Mongkhon said. 
  The Chiang Rai MP said he would hold a press conference 
after 
meeting party leader Chatchai Chunhawan today. 
  He would also ask the U.S. embassy why it did not send a 
letter to him to advise that his entry visa was denied. 
  Mr Mongkhon said the fact that he used to be the secretary 
of 
former agriculture and cooperatives minister Narong Wongwan, who 
was alleged to be on the U.S. blacklist of drug suspects should 
not be relevant to the drug allegations against him. 
  He challenged the Government to take legal action against 
him 
so he could prove he was innocent. 
  The MP, who happened to take the same flight to the northern 
province with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, said he might ask 
the premier for just treatment. 
  The Chat Phatthana Party issued a statement saying it would 
certainly take tough action against Mr Mongkhon if any criminal 
charge filed against him was proven. 
  The party said that at this stage Mr Mongkhon had not been 
charged in the U.S. or Thailand. The visa was denied on 
suspicion only.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Ngoc Tien] </F>
  [Text] Opium poppies grow well in mountainous areas having 
two seasons, a rainy hot season and a dry cold season. These 
special characteristics of opium poppies match those of the 
northwestern region in general and Lai Chau in particular. 
Because of this, poppies are grown here in rather large 
quantities. Based on a survey conducted in 1990, in Lai Chau 
Province there were 2,378 hectares planted in opium poppies. The 
Hmong have a tradition of planting opium poppies in the 
northwestern region. 
  The poppy growing areas in Lai Chau include Tua Chua and Sin 
Ho districts and the highlands areas of Phong Tho, Dien Bien, 
and Muong Te districts. As one of the places were opium is 
produced, this area has become a land of addicts. A 1990 survey 
conducted by the Lai Chau Labor, War Invalids, and Social 
Welfare Service showed that there were 13,000 addicts in the 
province, which is 2.85 percent of the province's total 
population. Nguyen Duc Thien, the director of the provincial 
Drug Prevention and Control Center, said that the number of 
addicts in 1993 was higher than in 1990. Most of the opium 
addicts in Lai Chau are Hmongs and Thais, but recently, more and 
more youths in the towns and cities have started using opium. He 
added that some border defense troops who go on patrols through 
the poppy fields make cigarettes using raw opium, and from long 
use they have become addicted to opium. In many highland Hmong 
villages, such tasks as tending the fields, obtaining firewood 
and water, and so on are done by women. The men stay at home 
smoking opium all day. In Lai Chau City, there are 13 homeless 
Hmong families who must live in rock caves. Because of their 
opium habit, they had to sell their homes. Each day, they go and 
cut firewood and then bring it back to the city to sell it to 
obtain money to buy rice and opium. At the provincial Drug 
Prevention and Control Center, which is located in Dien Bien Phu 
City, we met many people who had voluntarily come here for drug 
rehabilitation. Mr. N.V.K. had sold all his possessions, and 
Giang A Tong, who is from Pu Nhi Village in Dien Bien District, 
has been an addict for 38 years. He no longer looks like a man. 
Although he does not speak the Vietnamese language very well, Lo 
A Po, who is 64 years old and who has been using opium since 
1962, said that "at first, I used opium when I was ill, but now 
it uses me." However, among the addicts in Lai Chau, we did not 
see anyone who injects opium. There are 13,000 addicts, but the 
province has just one drug prevention and control and drug 
rehabilitation center with 10 beds. It treats only those who 
come here voluntarily. At present, the center has very few 
materials and very little equipment. Although it was just 
established on 29 June 1993 and actually went into operation in 
September 1993, the center has already helped 40 people kick 
their drug habit. 
  In 1990, the province prohibited the cultivation, storage, 
and sale of opium, but by the beginning of 1993, only 571 
hectares of opium poppies had been destroyed. The strange thing 
about opium is that while it does not require much labor to grow 
poppies, they bring high economic results. In a good season, one 
hectare of poppies can produce about 4 kg of opium. In March 
1994, a kg of opium was selling for 800,000 dong. At the same 
time, to earn 3.2 million dong, you would have to grow two 
hectares of corn with yields of two tons per hectare. In Lai 
Chau, there are villages in Dien Bien District where 90 percent 
of the households have Min motorcycles, and on their own they 
have built roads connecting the villages. They have been able to 
do this thanks to opium. Realizing the dangers of opium, many 
villages have voluntarily destroyed the poppies, but finding a 
suitable replacement crop is a problem for the various echelon 
and various sector cadres in Lai Chau. Tuan Giao District has 
replaced poppies with cardamom. But it takes seven years before 
the cardamom plants can be harvested, which means seven years of 
living in poverty. Sin Ho District has planted and harvested 
wheat, but it does not have any processing installations. And 
even if the wheat can be processed, it is difficult to find 
markets, because it is difficult for domestic flour to compete 
with flour from Germany, France, and China. Sung Chiu Thenh, the 
vice chairman of Dien Bien District, said that his district is 
planning to bring in and raise deer. He believes that it is 
possible to raise deer, but from where will the capital be 
obtained in view of the fact that a deer costs 20 million dong. 
  Giang A Tong said that in recent years, opium harvests have 
been bad because of the unfavorable weather. In 1994, from Tet 
until the middle of the 2d lunar month, it rained only twice. 
But poppies require heavy rains. 
  Regardless of where the opium came from, public security 
officials in Son La Province seized more than 200 kg of opium 
concealed in a vehicle in which the director of the Lai Chau 
Education Service was riding. 
  A provincial cadre responded by saying that that opium had 
been brought in from Laos. 
  Dien Bien District alone shares a 170-km border with Laos. 
Relations between the peoples of our two countries have always 
been very close, and people frequently cross the border to visit 
each other. Opium traffickers have made use of this to smuggle 
opium into Lai Chau. They usually hire local people to carry the 
opium using jungle routes that few people know about. The opium 
is then stored in one place until customers from the lowlands 
come to get it. 
  Can't something be done to stop this? 
  Interdiction is only at the level of.... 
  In 1993, the government allotted Lai Chau 2.1 billion dong 
to 
eradicate the poppy plants and curtail the use of opium. It is 
hoped that Lai Chau will overcome the difficulties in order to 
completely eradicate opium poppies. If Lai Chau and the 
northwest can eradicate opium poppies and stop the smuggling of 
opium, this will certainly reduce the number of addicts in the 
lowland provinces.

  [Editorial Report] The SHABAT supplement of Tel Aviv 
MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 27 May carries on pages 14, 15, and 19 a 
3,000-word report by Yosi Walter on Israeli efforts to combat 
the Lebanese drug trade. 
  Walter asserts that "about a year ago, a special team 
appointed by Police Minister Moshe Shahal, which acted under a 
heavy veil of secrecy," acquainted Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
with a plan "to destroy Lebanon's poppy crops. Such an action 
was supposed to deal a heavy blow to the Lebanese and Syrian 
economies, but its primary goal was to lift one of the direst 
threats to Israeli society--drugs brought in from Lebanon." 
  Walter states that the police minister's team suggested 
several operational options. "The first option was to destroy 
the poppy crops in al-Biqa'--the drug granary of Lebanon and 
Syria--by bombing or crop dusting. This option was ruled out 
because it entailed air activity in regions mostly controlled by 
the Syrian Army, which are covered by an efficient antiaircraft 
system. 
  "The second proposed method was bacteriological warfare." It 
was rejected because of danger to Israeli crops. 
  "The third and most interesting option involved genetically 
developed poppy seeds. These seeds grow only to half-maturity, 
at which time they inseminate the other plants and 
self-destruct. According to the plan, this chain reaction would 
destroy most of the poppy crops in Lebanon, and in long term, 
plantations in faraway countries as well. The method was given 
60 to 70 percent odds--an amazing rate by any standards. The 
prime minister embraced the idea, granting it a $1-million 
budget over a five-year period. Rafi Peled, the previous police 
chief, was acquainted with the plan, but did not get a chance to 
begin its implementation. Today the plan is gathering dust at 
national police headquarters." 
  Walter reports that Israeli efforts to combat the Lebanese 
drug peril included a "special report compiled with the 
objective of presenting it to the CIA and the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration, in a bid to convince Washington to 
think twice before removing Syria and Lebanon from its list of 
countries sponsoring the drug trade. The report, which was 
compiled by intelligence and police staffers, exposes the Syrian 
and Lebanese hypocrisy and fraudulence: How the Syrians and 
Lebanese con the whole world while getting good money for drugs." 
  According to Walter, the report maintains that Syria 
supplements its meager budget by participating in the drug 
trade. "The report presents Syria not merely as an involved 
country, which sponsors the Lebanese drug business, but also as 
a crossroads and transit station for drug smuggling and 
shipments. Raw materials--mainly opium from Iran, Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, and Turkey--are shipped to Lebanon's al-Biqa' via 
Syria. The finished products--hashish, heroin, and cocaine--are 
shipped back from Lebanon via Syria on their way to the West, 
and via Iran, Turkey, and Jordan on their way to Arab countries. 
These drugs pass through Syrian air and sea ports." 
  The report further claims that "Damascus does fight drug 
dealers, wreck poppy fields, destroy laboratories, or detain 
smugglers and traffickers. Its object is to solve domestic 
problems, rather than, God forbid, stop international trade." 
  Describing the "almost complete Syrian supremacy" in 
Lebanon, 
Walter cites the Israeli report as stating that sometimes "Syria 
destroys crops in order to force Lebanese organizations to toe 
the Syrian line." 
  The report is further cited on the subject of "Syria's 
sponsoring of drug smugglers in return for bribes." According 
to the report, "this method has permeated the Syrian upper 
echelons. Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas, for instance, 
supplied a notorious Lebanese drug dealer with a laissez-passer. 
A photocopy of the laissez-passer is included in the report. 
Other reports indicate that General 'Ali Dubah [name as 
transliterated], head of the Syrian security and intelligence 
division in Lebanon, issued similar permits--some in Syria and 
some in Lebanon." 
  Walter further states: "Syrian Intelligence has totally 
taken over the port of Tripoli. Its members check every cargo 
item, deciding on the customs to be paid by each and every drug 
dealer. Some officers have branched out to the shipping 
business." The report mentions the names of "several 
high-ranking Syrian Army officers from generals on down, who are 
involved in these deals." 
  Walter adds: "The main emphasis of the report is on the 
involvement of the upper Syrian echelons--namely, President 
al-Asad and his family. The report notes that while no 
information directly linking al-Asad to the drug business is 
available, some reports sustain the information claiming that he 
is fully aware of what goes on around him and of which of his 
close aides is involved in the drug trade." "Another prominent 
figure mentioned in the report is Rif'at al-Asad, the 
president's brother, whom the report describes as `an 
insatiable, corrupt personality.'"

  [Text] Bombay, April 21--The narcotics cell of the city 
police today destroyed 5,278 kg of drugs valued at Rs 425 crores 
in India, and many times this amount in the international 
market, at Reti Bunder, Sewri. 
  The narcotic and psychotropic substances destroyed included 
heroin, mandrax, hashish, opium and ganja. The drugs were 
destroyed after following the special procedure laid down by the 
NDPS [expansion not given] Act. It has to be followed since the 
courts have as yet not delivered judgment in the various cases 
filed by the police. 
  To preserve the evidence, representative samples and 
photographs of the drug seized are taken in the presence of 
metropolitan magistrate. The specially-constituted NDPS courts 
have to be then approached for permission to destroy the drugs. 
  The Act provides for their pre-trial destruction since there 
is always a fear that they might be stolen or substituted. 
Besides, a lot of space has to be provided for storage.

<F P=106> [Report by Alam Srinivas] </F>
  [Text] A seemingly innocuous advertisement, tucked away on 
the last page of THE ECONOMIC TIMES in April this year, caught 
the attention of R.M. Kakkar, who heads the Bombay office of the 
Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). The Madras-based advertiser had 
evinced an interest in buying a paracetamol-making unit. 
  Under normal circumstances, such interest should not have 
caused suspicion. Paracetamol is a legal antipyretic drug 
commonly used to reduce fever. But the unit can also be used to 
manufacture methaqualone (better known by its brand name 
mandrax), a narcotic drug which is banned in India and many 
other countries. It is also a drug that is causing major 
headaches to the NCB. Kakkar, whose office has recorded an 
increasing trend of the smuggling of mandrax tablets from India 
to South Africa, decided to investigate the matter. 
  The major concern is that India is the world's largest 
producer of mandrax. Though South Africa continues to be the 
biggest consumer, neighbouring African nations such as Kenya, 
Mozambique and Zambia, which so far were merely transit points 
of the mandrax trail, are also turning into users now. 
  Recent seizures by the NCB, the Department of Revenue 
Intelligence (DRI) and the Bombay Police, only confirm the 
alarming rise in mandrax smuggling. In 1990, these agencies 
seized 2,141 kg of mandrax tablets and powder in 60 cases which 
in 1993 went up nearly seven times to 15,004 kg (in 283 
instances). In the first quarter of 1994, seizures were over 
7,000 kg in only six swoops. South Africa was the final 
destination in most of the cases. 
  It is the easy money and huge profits that have attracted 
drug traffickers into this trade. At a conservative estimate, 
the annual turnover in the mandrax trade could be over Rs 1,500 
crore and profitability is quite high. Rahul Rai Sur, DCP 
[Deputy Commissioner of Police] (narcotics), Bombay Police, says 
that the production cost per tablet is a mere Re 1 while the 
selling price is anything up to Rs 100 on South African streets. 
  The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), a UN 
organisation set up to prevent the illicit traffic and use of 
drugs, is worried about this trend. In its 1993 annual report, 
released in February this year, the INCB stated that "the 
increasing illicit manufacture of methaqualone (mandrax) 
constitutes a major problem in India" which "remains the main 
source". 
  Mandrax is identical to barbiturates in its effect. 
Barbiturates are depressants which act on the central nervous 
system of the body and slow down many bodily functions. 
Mandrax, like barbiturates, can be addictive and prove fatal if 
consumed in combination with alcohol or other illegal drugs. At 
the behest of the INCB, many countries have banned its sale and 
production. India, too, banned the drug in 1984. 
  Since then, the country has found itself in the piquant 
position of becoming a centre for the illicit production of 
mandrax. The country's pharmaceutical industry is 
technologically developed and the know-how to make the drug 
exists as it was freely produced prior to the ban. 
  South Africa, on the other hand, has been a user country 
since the 1970's. NCB officials contend that with the growing 
economic prosperity of the majority black population in the 
'80's, the demand for mandrax has gone up. To get an extra 
kick, black workers, whose per capita annual income has trebled 
since 1984, mix mandrax in liquor or smoke it in powdered form 
with marijuana. 
  Given the huge profits, heroin and antique smugglers have 
taken up the mandrax trade in a big way. On January 11 this 
year, the Bombay Police arrested a 33-year-old doctor, Imtiaz 
Ahmed Illiyas. Illiyas and his four colleagues were carrying 600 
grams of heroin and they led the police to the largest seizure 
(4,800 kg) of mandrax ever made. The tablets, destined to reach 
Mozambique, were found in 206 drums stored in a 20-ft container 
at Victoria docks. 
  In August 1992, the Bombay police stumbled upon a gang of 
the 
three Bhatt brothers and seized over 100 kg of mandrax tablets. 
In addition to this, the police recovered an 11th century 
sandstone icon (3 ft 3 inch in height) of Lord Parshawanath, 
stolen from a Jain temple in Gujarat. 
  For heroin traffickers, shifting to an indigenous drug makes 
business sense. Mandrax is more profitable as it is produced in 
India unlike heroin. Further, the international crackdown on 
heroin since the mid-'80's has also forced Indian drug 
traffickers based in the Middle East to look at alternatives to 
remain in the trade. 
  Police investigations indicate that some major mandrax gang 
leaders may be based in Dubai. Sur says that he is on the verge 
of charge-sheeting one of them. Police sources say the 
investigative trail in at least two major cases leads to Dubai. 
  On August 19 last year, a jeep containing 150 kg mandrax 
tablets was seized outside a restaurant in Bombay. The vehicle 
was rented out to Milind Chalke, a resident of Andheri who owned 
a tabletting factory in Paundvillage, about 30 km from Pune. 
Chalke's trail led to a businessman based in Lusaka, Zambia, 
who is suspected to have links in Dubai. 
  However, NCB officials, while admitting the involvement of 
organised gangs, feel that the supposed Dubai links are still 
weak. "It's too early to jump to conclusions," says the NCB'S 
Deputy Director-General, A.M. Prasad. In fact, even the Bombay 
High Court has released all the accused in the August 1993 case 
on bail. 
  With the slow progress by investigative agencies in catching 
the gang leaders, the mandrax trade continues unabated. The 
modus operandi and the route are clear from recent seizures and 
raids. The main production bases are centered in Maharashtra and 
Gujarat though the NCB has found a few units in Rajasthan and 
Madhya Pradesh as well. 
  According to NCB officials, even some of the legitimate drug 
units, especially paracetamol-making ones, are being diverted to 
produce mandrax. This was the reason why Kakkar was worried 
about THE ECONOMIC TIMES advertisement. The technology and even 
the chemical ingredients are the same for both drugs. In the 
January 1994 case, the police found that Illiyas and his 
partners were also producing mandrax at the Gujarat-based Ambala 
Organics Chemicals Pvt Ltd, originally owned by 10 partners who 
sold the sick unit for Rs 48.50 lakh to the drug smugglers. 
  The common way of smuggling mandrax is through the Bombay 
port by falsely declaring export consignments and giving 
incorrect names of both the exporting firm and the African 
importer. The 4,800-kg found in the container at Indira docks 
was supposed to contain red oxide. In December 1993, the NCB, 
Bombay, intercepted a consignment of wooden boxes at Victoria 
docks said to be carrying water heaters. Instead, the boxes 
contained 1,500 kg of mandrax. Another 3,200-kg consignment was 
seized by the NCB, Bombay, in January 1993. Packed in 320 
plastic bags, it was supposed to contain talcum powder. Both 
the exporter, Ganesh Export Import International, and the buyer, 
Societe Generale d'Alimentation in Zaire, in this case were 
non-existent. 
  However, as narcotic agencies in Bombay have geared up to 
stop this illegal trade, the traffickers are changing their 
routes. A lot of mandrax is now being smuggled out of Gujarat 
ports. In one case, in July 1993, the DRI intercepted a lorry 
on the Pune-Belgaum highway. Starting from Vapi, Gujarat, and 
proceeding to the Tuticorin port in Kerala, the vehicle 
contained 2,300 kg mandrax concealed inside 180 bags partially 
loaded with onions. According to NCB sources, the mandrax was 
bound for Africa via Sri Lanka. 
  What is of utmost importance to both the Indian authorities 
and the INCB is the fact that the use of mandrax is spreading to 
both the producer and transit countries. The INCB has noted in 
its 1993 report that manufacturing bases and even the use of 
mandrax have been found in countries such as Zambia and Kenya. 
In Kenya, three factories were dismantled in 1993. Even in 
India, there is an alleged case of a confectionery manufacturer 
in Gujarat who was selling toffees containing mandrax in major 
cities in Rajasthan. The toffee samples have been sent to the 
forensic labs by the NCB for further investigations. As an 
international narcotics expert in Delhi says: "If the problem 
is not contained now, it could become a worldwide phenomenon 
like heroin."

  [Excerpts] Six people were arrested at Kongolo in Caprivi 
in possession of 25,823 Mandrax tablets with a street value of 
Namibian dollars 645,000 in the biggest Mandrax bust in Namibia. 
The six included two Namibian citizens, Edwin Modibedi and 
Regina Mojakie, and four South Africans Pretty Kondlo, Beauty 
Jacobs, Charles Pietersen and Immanuel Murrulhna. [passage 
omitted] 
  The six had passed undetected through a border post with 
Zambia. 
  Nampol [Namibian Police] spokesperson Edwin Kanguatjivi 
yesterday told reporters that the six were arrested by members 
of the Namibian Police Drug Enforcement Bureau with the 
co-operation of the Zambian police. [passage omitted] 
  Asked whether drug traffickers considered Namibian security 
poor, Kanguatjivi said Namibia happened to be on a recognised 
drug route. 
  Nampol's Inspector Louis Mensah said the tablets were 
manufactured in Bombay, India, and, according to information, 
also in Zambia. He said the drug was banned in South Africa in 
1976. Previously it was prescribed as sleeping tablets.

<F P=106> [Report by Stephane Bothima] </F>
  [Text] More than 100 drug syndicates were operating in SA 
and were using the political instability, unemployment and 
insufficient border control in the region to their advantage, SA 
Police Services special units chief Gen Wouter Grove said 
yesterday. SA did not only serve as a transit destination for 
drugs to Europe, but was itself also, fast developing into a 
major drug market, Grove told a Security '94 conference 
presented by the University of Pretoria's Institute for 
Strategic Studies. 
  Political instability, lawlessness, unemployment, 
insufficient border control and a lack of an awareness of the 
dangers of drug abuse rendered SA an attractive market for drug 
traffickers, he said. Many syndicates were based in Nigeria, 
from which large loads of cocaine were shipped to SA. 
  Worldwide, at least $85bn[billion] in drug profits was 
laundered through the financial markets each year, he said, 
adding that never before had one form of criminal activity 
generated such enormous sums of ready money for investment in 
business, both legal and illegal. 
  Grove said an estimated 2.5-million people worldwide, 
excluding users, were believed to be directly involved in 
drug-related activities. He said heroin was the latest drug 
trend of the 1990s due to the production of and demand for 
cocaine appearing to be leveling off. 
  Grove added that the SA drug market was dominated by dagga 
[marijuana], Mandrax, cocaine, heroin and LSD. 
  SA Narcotics Bureau statistics clearly indicated a sharp 
rise 
in smuggling, especially cocaine, to the region. "The financial 
profit to be gained by the smuggling of this drug is 
self-evident when one considers that the street value of cocaine 
fluctuates between R200/g [gram] and R400/g," he said. 
  Smuggling networks were so well established, not only in the 
southern African region but worldwide, that the same routes were 
often used for drugs, weapons, cars, ivory and gemstones. 
  "Mandrax is increasingly being bartered for stolen vehicles 
and vehicle spare parts from SA," Grove told the conference. 
  Heroin smugglers from southeast Asia and southwest Asia, as 
well as Mandrax syndicates from India, had recently expanded 
their operations in SA via East and North Africa, while 
Colombian cocaine smuggling druglords had moved their operations 
to Nigeria, from which they focused on the SA market, he said. 
  Grove said police agencies simply did not have the manpower 
or resources to match the limitless billions of the drug 
syndicates. To combat the problem, a close relationship between 
all the parties involved in the prevention of drug use should be 
established.

  [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Interior Minister and 
chairman of the inter-ministerial anti-drug committee Jan Ruml 
talked to the Bernard Leroy, chairman of the UN Drug Control 
Program about bringing Czech Law into line with UN agreements on 
drugs, Interior Ministry spokesman Beata Bernikova told CTK 
today. 
  Leroy arrived today at Ruml's invitation for an official 
visit to the Czech Republic. Also present at the talks were 
Health Minister Ludek Rubas, Deputy Justice Minister Cyril 
Svoboda and Deputy Interior Minister Martin Fendrych. 
  Ruml told Leroy about the Czech Republic's fight against 
drugs and drug-related crime, Bernikova said, and is at present 
preparing a proposal that the status of the inter-ministerial 
anti-drug committee be raised, to give it more powers. The 
ministers involved should meet at its sessions twice a year. 
  Bernikova said the Czech Republic was paying considerable 
attention to the preparation of new laws concerning drugs. It 
was working on a law on money-laundering and perfecting a law on 
narcotic and psychotropic substances. Other necessary measures 
would be worked into the new criminal law and the criminal code, 
he said. 
  Leroy will also take part in a meeting of the 
inter-ministerial drug committee, Bernikova said. He welcomed 
the attention which the Czech Republic was paying to the drug 
problem, and offered financial and administrative help in the 
fight against drugs.

  [Text] Gdansk, May 24 -- The international drugs business 
is increasingly often using the Gdansk route to smuggle drugs to 
western countries since the Balkans have been ridden by war and 
the traditional routes are unsafe. [sentence as received] 
  For example, prosecutors in Gdansk are investigating the 
case 
of Janusz H. who was arrested last January under the charge of 
having tried to smuggle half-a-tonne of cocaine aboard a Polish 
ship "Lublin 2," but they also work to trace all the 
international ramifications of the case. 
  According to reports obtained by Gdansk prosecutors from 
U.S. 
authorities, Janusz H. had earlier been sentenced in the United 
States for a similar crime to 30 years in jail. In 1985 he was 
the skipper of a fishing ship "Kuna" and got caught off Florida 
coast while trying to smuggle 15 tonnes of marijuana. 
  Released earlier and deported to Poland, Janusz H. started 
his own business as the owner of a Col-Pol-de-Pesca company 
chiefly preoccupied with trading with Colombia. His interest in 
doing business with Latin Americans was not incidental. While 
in a U.S. jail, he had made friends with a Bolivian citizen 
Pedro Julio B.A. who was serving an 18-year term for cocaine 
smuggling. This man was seen in Gdynia at the time when Janusz 
H. was arrested but prosecutors did not manage to gather 
evidence against him and he was released. Last June, police in 
Ecuador seized a 10-kg parcel with heroin addressed to Janusz H. 
in Gdynia, Prosecutor Mariusz Marciniak told PAP.

Colombia"] 
  [Excerpt] International police cooperation has born fruit 
again. At a Ministry of Internal Affairs news conference a week 
ago, we received a hint that officers from the Bureau To Combat 
Drug Trafficking, in cooperation with DEA agents, were preparing 
operations such as the following: Good cooperation among the 
Vienna branch of the DEA, the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, 
and the Koper police resulted in a successful operation when 1.5 
kg of cocaine was seized in Koper on 21 April. Martin Vrancic, 
chief of the Bureau To Combat Drug Trafficking, said the drugs 
had come through Brnik airport and that this was not the first 
time something like this had happened. He believes that an 
extremely well-organized group is behind the cocaine-smuggling 
operation, that it is organized in a pyramid structure, and that 
it uses computer technology. The drugs were hidden in two 
computer magnetic-tape boxes. The Koper police turned three 
persons over to the local prosecutor's office. They are 
citizens of Colombia, Italy, and Slovenia. The Slovene citizen 
lives in Colombia. One of the foreigners was taken into 
custody. The investigation has not been concluded. Just today 
at noon, that is Wednesday, another suspect belonging to this 
group was arrested in Ljubljana. He is a Croatian citizen. He 
was also turned over to the Koper prosecutor. The cocaine seized 
has a market value of approximately 200,000 German marks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Heroin and Cocaine Seized"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Their obvious nervousness was the undoing of 
two drug couriers from Slovakia. As Joachim Pirker from the 
Vienna Security Office reported, 26-year-old Jozef F. and his 
22-year-old compatriot Radoslav K. were arrested at the 
Westbahnhof railroad station in Vienna on 14 May. [passage 
omitted] 
  F. and K. tried first to pose as harmless tourists. However, 
in their car, a rented Skoda with a Slovak license plate, the 
officials found about one kg of heroin of very good quality, 
which was packed in small portions in a plastic bag and is 
valued at about 4 million schillings. After first denials, the 
Slovaks became entangled in contradictions and finally admitted 
that as drug couriers they had "supplied" heroin from the 
Bratislava area via Austria to Switzerland and Germany for 
months. 
  So far, the security office has succeeded in proving eight 
smuggling trips against the two men, where heroin valued at a 
total of about 22 million schillings had been transported. Only 
two days before their arrest, F. and K. had been with four kg of 
the drug in Switzerland. F. and K. were not able or willing to 
say anything about the people behind them. However, they are 
probably Kosovo Albanians. 
  The drug squad at Vienna-Schwechat Airport has again exposed 
a Colombian drug courier. On Wednesday [18 May], the man had 
arrived from Ecuador via Amsterdam with 770 grams of cocaine 
with a black market value of about 2 million schillings in the 
false bottom of his travel bag and the hollowed-out soles of his 
shoes. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Hz."-signed report: "To Jointly Combat Extremists"] </F>
  [Text] Magdeburg -- The new justice and interior ministers 
of the new laender want to closely cooperate to a greater extent 
than before in the combating of extremist violence from the 
right and the left, as well as organized and cross-border crime. 
A ministers conference in Magdeburg resolved on Wednesday [25 
May] to counteract above all extreme-right violence by an 
increased exchange of information and experiences. New 
strategies to combat small extremist groups are to be jointly 
developed and evaluated. The exchange of preventive concepts is 
to provide better protection of foreigners' accommodations and 
asylum-seekers' homes. 
  The Magdeburg decision further says: The ministers "state 
their firm intention to deepen their cooperation in the 
prevention and prosecution of violent extremist criminals and 
violent criminal acts and to fully support each other mutually, 
particularly in the prevention of prepared actions or marches of 
extremist organizations." 
  Regarding cross-border crime, the conference called on the 
FRG Government to specify and supplement the existing and 
planned treaties with Poland and the Czech Republic. Direct 
political cooperation at the border and mutual legal assistance 
have to be facilitated and all official processes to be 
shortened. 
  Because of first signs of organized crime in the new laender 
alone, the ministers think that it is necessary "to take 
consistent action with joint strategies involving more than one 
land." In general, information and experiences also have to be 
intensively exchanged here. The public prosecutor's offices 
should be consulted in joint official meetings of police and 
customs authorities. 
  The ministers expressed concern about the different 
conclusions from the "hashish ruling" of the Federal 
Constitutional Court in the old laender. A liberalization of 
the narcotics law must be prevented as far as possible. In the 
assessment of the possession of small amounts of the drug, each 
individual case has to be examined by all means, it was stated. 
On no account must one refrain from punishment if drugs are 
consumed in schools, recreational facilities for young people, 
barracks, or other facilities where young people and children 
stay. The possession of hard drugs has to be prosecuted in any 
case. The point is to "ensure that the scourge of drugs is 
averted from the new laender," Saxony-Anhalt Interior and 
Justice Minister Walter Remmers (Christian Democratic Union) 
said.

  [Text] Super-strong heroin, up to 55 percent pure, is 
circulating in Greece. 
  Among confiscated samples sent for inspection to the state 
laboratory was the same heroin that killed Vasilis Tsaklof, 
containing 24 percent of the drug and 54 percent of lactose. 
That combination in itself is not necessarily fatal but the 
victim had combined it with Hypnostedon pills. 
  Attica police headquarters said that heroin in the Greek 
market used to be only ten to 15 percent pure. The state lab 
inspected ten different samples of the drug, confiscated in 
Athens, and discovered that their heroin content ranged from 22 
to 55 percent. 
  The number of victims this month in Athens from "instant 
death" heroin has now risen to 15 whilst heroin addict Dhimos 
Tsagalidhis, 27, is in a coma at a hospital in Serres, northern 
Greece.

<F P=106> [Article: "Cannabis `Just 10pc of Total'"] </F>
  [Text] Cannabis worth &pound;57m has been seized along the 
Cork coast in the last two years--but that is only 10pc 
[percent] of the estimated total shipments, it was claimed 
yesterday. 
  Primitive surveillance techniques have also made Ireland 
`the 
drugs capital of Europe' and the 500-mile coastline of West Cork 
and South Kerry has become a haven for the global drug runner, 
the British magazine Esquire said. 
  The article claimed the seizures of drugs in the Cork area 
owed more to "nosy coastal dwellers" and carelessness than to 
law enforcement. 
  A spokeswoman for the Revenue Commissioners said, however, 
that the National Drugs Team had an extensive mobile network and 
its operations were based on intelligence gathering and 
co-operation across Europe.

    [Editorial Report] According to the 30 April Lisbon daily 
EXPRESSO, in three months Portuguese drug addicts exchanged in 
pharmacies almost half a million used needles within the context 
of the operation "Say No to a Second-Hand Needle." Launched by 
the National Commission Against AIDS in cooperation with the 
National Pharmacies Association, the campaign, which took place 
between October and December 1993, involved most of the 
institutions charged with combating AIDS and drug addiction. 
Pharmacies made available to drug addicts 610,000 kits 
containing a sterile needle, an alcohol-soaked pad and a condom, 
accompanied by an explanatory pamphlet. The kit was exchanged 
for a used needle. The report compiled about the operation 
revealed that 57.5 percent of the 446,920 needles were collected 
in the Lisbon area. Some 20 percent came from Porto, 12 percent 
from Setubal, 5.2 percent from Braga, 4 percent from Faro, 0.9 
percent from Leiria, and 0.4 percent from the rest of the 
country. Even if it is not possible to extrapolate from these 
figures, it seems that official estimates concerning the 
proliferation of drug addiction and the AIDS virus are well 
below real figures. According to the National Commission Against 
AIDS, only 1,416 cases of infection were detected until 
September of last year, 289 of which were among drug addicts.

  [Text] "The success of the Dragon leaders is undeniable. In 
the last few months we have been forced to face an enormous 
problem, one with which we were not equipped to deal," says a 
police inspector working on the subject. 
  The growth of Chinese mafias has been accompanied by a surge 
in illegal immigration. To smuggle large numbers of illegals 
into Spain, Chinese mafias have recourse to many techniques. 
Police suspect the Chinese crime syndicates are dispatching 
ships with holds crammed full of illegal immigrants; "cargo" is 
then off-loaded, on the high seas, into boats operated by drug 
smugglers now trafficking in human flesh. 
  Police reached this conclusion after noting the sudden 
appearance of large numbers of Chinese citizens in Galicia. 
Also, some Chinese have been arrested approaching beaches in 
southern Spain in small Moroccan fishing boats. 
  In large part, the success of Chinese mafia leaders derives 
from their unusual methods. The heads of the organizations all 
reside in Hong Kong or mainland China; their "delegations" in 
Europe keep their principal headquarters in London or Amsterdam. 
Third-level operatives are constantly on the move all over 
Europe, looking for illegal activities with the greatest profit 
potential and relocating to a new country as soon as they come 
to the notice of police. 
  In Spain, they have concentrated on four areas: exploiting 
the "slave labor" of illegal immigrants, prostitution, extortion 
targeting the resident Chinese community, and heroin trafficking. 
<H5>  Turkish Decline </H5>
  The Chinese organizations are well-structured and 
commercially sophisticated, a fact that has allowed them to 
displace other criminal syndicates. Thus there has been a 
decline in the activities of the Turkish mafia, which Spanish 
police had already been fairly successful in combatting over the 
last few years but which has lost even more ground to the 
Chinese, who distribute a better grade of heroin, "China white," 
at better prices and with reduced risk. 
  In a few short months, the Chinese mafia have carved out a 
niche for themselves in the criminal underworld, and Spanish 
police are putting together teams of experts who--with advice 
from British and Dutch specialists--are beginning to map the 
confusing tangle of Chinese illegal organizations. 
  So far, four "tentacles" have been identified in Spain. The 
biggest of the Chinese mafias is Sap Sie Kee, also know as "14 
K." The organization was born during the civil war in China in 
the 1940's, and over time it has degenerated into a criminal 
ring specializing in the heroin traffic. 
  Sap Sie Kee, believed to have more than 10,000 members 
worldwide, "commercializes" most of the heroin produced in 
Southeast Asia. 
  In Spain, it has two modus operandi. First, it operates 
behind the "cover" of various businesses that specialize in 
importation of oriental food products. Second, it hires African 
immigrants and sends them to Thailand to serve as "mules" 
transporting illegal drugs. 
  These operations sometimes leave visible traces. Several 
days 
ago, an African lost a leg after falling onto the subway tracks 
in downtown Madrid, shoved by three Chinese who took flight. 
Police theorize that he was shoved, in a dispute triggered by 
the disappearance of a heroin packet the African had promised to 
bring back from Bangkok, and that the Chinese were Sap Sie Kee 
mafiosi. 
  A second group is called Sun Yee On, whose leaders live in 
mainland China; it specializes in illegal immigration. 
  Sun Yee On recruits intending emigrants in China, loads them 
into boats in international waters near Hong Kong, and ships 
them all over the world. Depending on circumstances, emigrants 
pay between 1 and 2 million pesetas. To get them to their 
destinations, the syndicate resorts to unusual routings: In some 
cases, they are taken to airports and fly into Europe bearing 
false travel documents. In other cases, they travel hidden in 
the holds of merchant ships that drop them off on the coasts of 
Spain, France, or Italy. 
  There have been instances where illegal immigrants have 
spent 
months on these "floating prisons," waiting for a propitious 
moment to disembark on the coast or at ports in defiance of the 
authorities. 
<H5>  Oriental Women </H5>
  To make matters even more difficult for police, Sun Yee On 
in 
recent weeks has been using large numbers of false Mexican, 
Peruvian, and Bolivian passports in which false immigrant visas 
for Spain have been stamped. Once immigrants reach Barajas 
airport, the organization hides them for a short period of time, 
issues new travel documents, and then sends them onward from 
Madrid to the United States. Several weeks ago, police 
apprehended a number of Chinese immigrants using this route as 
they prepared to leave Spain for New York. 
  The third organization is Wo On Lok, which specializes in 
pornographic videos, prostitution, and trafficking in children. 
  It relocates women from the brothels of Manila and Bangkok 
and works them in Spanish bathhouses. In recent cases 
investigated by police, the women were collecting 15,000 pesetas 
from each client, were allowed to keep 1,500 for themselves, and 
turned over to their "protectors" profits that amounted to some 
700,000 pesetas per month. 
  The last of the groups working in Spain is called Dai Hoon 
and operates as a clandestine bank, providing ready cash at high 
interest rates. Illegal immigrants denied access to regular 
banks go to Dai Hoon, usually working themselves deeper and 
deeper into debt. The syndicate is also moving into "protection 
rackets" targeting the proprietors of Chinese restaurants and 
business establishments. 
  Although there is some division of labor, all four mafias 
are 
involved in every domain. 
  The organizations have an organic structure which they 
maintain with rigid military discipline. In general, each mafia 
is organized into three-person "cells," also known as "triads," 
in which one person, referred to as the "trusty," serves as 
chief and handles relations with other cells, while the other 
two are "foot-soldiers." To the latter fall the tasks of 
administering beatings, collecting debts, and murdering rivals 
when ordered to do so. 
<H5>  Sap Sie Kee (14 K) </H5>
  This is the biggest crime syndicate in the world and has a 
budget bigger than that of many national governments. It 
specializes in heroin trafficking. It distributes all the drug 
production of Southeast Asia and has close to 10,000 members 
worldwide. A major headache for police everywhere, the 
organization was built out of remnants of the Nationalist army 
after its defeat by Mao Ze Dung. 
<H5>  Sun Yee On </H5>
  Though involved in all types of criminal activity, its 
biggest money-makers are emigration and exploitation of "slave" 
labor. The organization's main headquarters are in the Chinese 
interior, in Fujian, the starting point for most clandestine 
departures. It does so much business that it no longer involves 
itself in sale of false documents. Now it transports boatloads 
of emigrants, dropping them off on the coasts of Europe and the 
United States. 
<H5>  Wo On Lok </H5>
  This syndicate has a near monopoly on prostitution, the 
pornographic film industry, and child-trafficking for 
pedophiles. Its leaders are ensconced somewhere in the bowels of 
Hong Kong's brothel districts; it is mainly a syndicate of 
pimps. Wo On Lok's European headquarters are in Amsterdam, but 
it constantly shifts women around to increase profits. In Spain, 
it often markets its girls as "Japanese." 
<H5>  Dai Hoon </H5>
  The very name of this mafia syndicate--which translates as 
"The Big Club"--suggests the image of a mutual support society. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, it is an 
illegal bank that lends money at usurious interest rates and 
ends up enslaving its clients. It acts as a clandestine bank, 
making loans for gambling purposes as well as to defray 
settling-in costs of illegal immigrants. It also extorts money 
from restaurants.

for Producing Heroin"] 
  [Text] Teams from the Directorate of Police Narcotics 
Department in Istanbul established some time ago that a villa in 
the Cekmekoy quarter of the city was used as a heroin-producing 
center. The teams carried out an operation against the occupants 
of the villa, which stands on four donums of land. The teams, 
who were armed with automatic firearms, surrounded the villa, 
the courtyard of which was sealed off by a high wall and barbed 
wire. The teams crawled to the building and established how 
many drug traffickers were inside. Then they went in. 
  Under the command of Ismail Caliskan, director of the 
Directorate of Police Narcotics Department, they broke down the 
front door and stormed the building. They arrested the drug 
traffickers without giving them an opportunity to use their 
arms. The production center was on the ground floor. The teams 
discovered 60 kg of heroin and morphine base, three handguns, 
one of which was automatic, and a large quantity of ammunition 
in the attic.

Johannes Dijkstra at the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. The drug 
trafficker reportedly revealed that he charged the dispatchers 
of the heroin double the amount usually paid to couriers because 
the airport police have begun to use dogs, which can sniff and 
detect narcotics. The police searched Dijkstra and his suitcase

<F P=106> [Article by A.J. Mcllroy: "Cocaine Haul Worth &pound;250m </F>
Discovered in Tar Drums"] 
  [Text] The biggest seizure of hard drugs in Britain with a 
street value of &pound;250 million has been found in 47 drums of 
bitumen being shipped from South America to Poland. 
  The 1,300 kilos of particularly high purity cocaine were 
discovered by customs officers who searched a tramp steamer 
calling at Birkenhead, Merseyside, three months ago. 
  Customs in Britain and Poland did not announce the find 
until 
yesterday so that an undercover operation could track the drugs 
to their destination. 
  Officers acting on intelligence reports boarded the 
Polish-American ship the MV Jurata, which had berthed 
at Liverpool on Jan 24 en route from Venezuela to Poland to 
unload some legitimate cargo. 
  They examined 48 barrels carrying bitumen, calling on 
Merseyside fire brigade to send crews with special cutting 
equipment to open the drums. 
  Mr Douglas Tweedle, Customs chief investigator, said: "The 
first one was genuine, but that did not put us off. The other 47 
had inner containers each packed with up to 30 kilos of cocaine, 
all insulated to protect the cocaine from the heat of the 
bitumen. 
  "The cocaine was removed and identical drums were loaded on 
board Jurata which then sailed on schedule for the 
Polish port of Gdynia." 
  Mr Tweedle said there had been no reason to suspect the 
captain and crew knew about the illegal cargo. 
  The vessel was tracked to Gdynia in the hope of identifying 
the smugglers, who he said were believed to be members of the 
Polish Mafia. One man was being interviewed by Polish police 
after the drums were delivered to a warehouse on the outskirts 
of Warsaw on Feb 3. 
  But so far customs officers have not been able to identify 
the Western European figures behind the deal and there had been 
no arrests. 
  Merseyside customs officers were acting on intelligence 
provided by the service's strategic branch in London, which said 
it was engaged in a constant war against "narco baron" 
traffickers. 
  These traffickers were taking advantage of the collapse of 
the former Soviet Union to smuggle drugs from South America into 
Western Europe through the back door--through places like Poland 
and Russia "whose customs services are not particularly well 
developed."

<F P=106> [Article: "Stateless Ship `Was Carrying &pound;57m Worth of </F>
Cannabis'"] 
  [Text] Customs officers in a helicopter descended on a 
stateless ship carrying 17 tonnes of cannabis resin with a 
street value of &pound;57 million, Leeds crown court was told 
yesterday. 
  Five Dutchmen and one Spaniard were aboard the rig support 
vessel, Britannia Gazelle, which was carrying the drug in 857 
bales in the North Sea, it was alleged. 
  The six seamen pleaded not guilty to charges relating to 
drug-running brought under the Criminal Justice (International 
Co-operation) Act, 1990. 
  Michael Harrison, QC, prosecuting, said the Britannia 
Gazelle, a former trawler which had been de-registered in 
Britain, had left Lowestoft, Suffolk, in November 1992, and 
rendezvoused in the Atlantic with a trawler believed to be from 
Spain. 
  In mid-ocean the cannabis was transferred to the Britannia 
Gazelle, which then returned to the British Isles around the 
Scottish coast before steaming towards Norway and eventually to 
a position 130 miles east of Newcastle, where it was boarded by 
customs after being secured by armed forces. 
  Jan Wagenaar, aged 48, Laurens Frans Dirk Pels-Rycken, 29, 
Cornelis Van Delft, 45, Hans Pronk, 48, Jan Peters, 46, and 
Rojeirio Santiago-Maya, 48, deny conspiring together with other 
persons unknown fraudulently to evade prohibition of the 
importation of cannabis resin. 
  All six further deny being knowingly concerned in carrying a 
controlled drug on a ship. 
  The trial continues.

  [Text] Police have seized 90 kilos of the drug Ecstasy with 
a street value of &pound;6 million. 
  Five men--two of them Dutch--were arrested in raids in 
Ilford, Chingford and Woodford, Essex, when &pound;1 million 
worth 
of counterfeit Spanish pesetas was also recovered. 
  A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Regional Crime Squad 
said 
the weekend raids were not connected with the seizure of 
&pound;15 
million of forged notes and printing equipment at a printing 
works in Islington, north London, on Sunday. 
  Four men will appear at Redbridge magistrates court, east 
London, today in connection with that discovery. 
  Lithographic plate maker Paul Matthew Carter, 36, of Sussex; 
printers Robert David Brown, 44, of Loughton, Essex, and Steven 
Victor Ross, 20, of Romford, Essex, and company director Robert 
Barry Kalmanson, 46, of Stanmore, Middlesex, are charged with 
conspiracy to contravene the Forgery and Counterfeit Act. 
  Officers also found bundles of forged Irish, American, 
Spanish, Nigerian and Romanian currency in the Islington raid. 
Details of the notes will be passed to banks in each of the 
countries involved. 
  In the past year, the squad has found &pound;13 million in 
forged notes.

<F P=106> [Article by Duncan Campbell, crime correspondent: "Cannabis </F>
Hidden in Cars of Unsuspecting Visitors to Spain and France; 
Smugglers `Dupe Tourists Into Bringing Back Drugs'"] 
  [Text] English drug smugglers are using unsuspecting 
tourists in France and Spain to bring drugs into this country, 
according to lawyers and travellers who have been arrested on 
the Continent. 
  They claim that smugglers befriend visiting tourists and 
businessmen and hide drugs in their cars before they cross the 
Channel. 
  Ron Williams, aged 55, of Newport, Gwent, is a transport 
manager and HGV driver who had no criminal record. In January 
1993, he travelled to Spain to meet potential clients. 
  In Fuengirola, he met an English couple in a bar who said 
they were touring Spain. Mr Williams told them he had a problem 
with his car, and they said they knew a mechanic who could fix 
it. The mechanic returned the car saying he had repaired an 
electrical fault. He also said that a relative might be 
interested in a business deal and asked for Mr William's 
address. Mr Williams gave him his business card. 
  Mr Williams set off home, taking the sleeper from Malaga and 
putting his car on a separate train. At the French border at 
Hendaye he was searched by Customs officers and he told them of 
his car. 
  Two and a half hours later Mr Williams was woken at Bordeaux 
by customs officers and told that 16 kilos of cannabis had been 
found in the rear inner panels of his car at the border. He was 
arrested. 
  His trial took place in Bayonne. The judge had been told 
that 
a Ronald Williams had previous convictions for robbery in 
Britain and armed robbery in Germany. Mr Williams protested that 
the records shown were of another Ronald Williams, that it was a 
common name in Britain and his full name was Ronald Watkins 
Williams. 
  "The judge was not interested and the trial was over in 25 
minutes," Mr Williams said last week. "There was a school party 
in the court being shown how the court worked and while the 
judge was out, the children were told in front of me that this 
was how foreign drug smugglers were dealt with." 
  He was jailed for two years. "I was told that the penalty 
was 
heavier because there were the schoolchildren there." After 
serving a year he was told that if he agreed to pay &pound;5,000 
he 
would be released early. He returned in February. 
  "I have never been involved with the police before but now I 
have lost my business, I have bills from when I was locked up to 
pay. If I had really been smuggling drugs surely I would have 
got off the train as soon as it was obvious they were going to 
search my car." 
  Mr Williams has contacted Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer and the 
chairman of Fair Trials Abroad, who specialises in cases 
involving British subjects in foreign jails. Mr Jakobi said it 
was one of a number of cases he is handling where people are 
"befriended" in France or Spain and drugs are later found in 
their car. 
  In one case, Doug Belcher, an electrical engineer, is due to 
stand trial in Bayonne on May 5, accused of importing 44 kilos 
of cannabis. He met English people in a Malaga restaurant and 
told them his travel plans. He has said he believes drugs could 
have been hidden in door panels during the meal. 
  In another case, Raymond Bickley, aged 49, from Brighton, 
who 
is in the travel business, was arrested in St Malo in December 
1992 in the car of a man he had met a few days earlier. His 
family were not told of his arrest for two weeks. "I have never 
taken, bought, sold, imported or exported drugs," he said. "The 
only time I have been offered drugs was during my incarceration 
in Rennes." 
  The use of travellers by drug smugglers is an old ruse; 
Customs officers would say it is also an old excuse used by 
people when arrested. But Mr Jakobi said the pattern of 
complaint to him indicated that innocent people are being 
arrested. 
  "Either it's people using unwitting travellers or else 
setting people up as decoys," he said yesterday. "What is of 
concern is that the latest figures show that there are 270 
British people in prison in France, of whom a quarter are in 
Bayonne. The judges do not have the time or the patience to 
listen to and investigate their cases, and as a result innocent 
people are being imprisoned."

<F P=106> [Article: "Thai Drugs Suspect `Duped'"] </F>
  [Text] A Manchester woman held by Thai police for smuggling 
11lb of heroin claimed yesterday that she had been duped by a 
Nigerian boyfriend and thought she was carrying gold or 
jewellery. 
  Speaking from her cell yesterday, Patricia Fury, a convicted 
prostitute, said: "I honestly didn't know it was drugs. A 
Nigerian boyfriend called Paul told me he dealt in gold and 
jewellery. When he asked me to take something, I assumed it was 
gold or jewellery." 
  When customs officials arrested her at Bangkok airport as 
she 
arrived to catch a flight to Singapore, they found her bag 
contained heroin with a street value of &pound;100,000. The 
Nigerian, who claimed to be a bullion dealer, had vanished. 
  Fury, a mother of two boys aged ten and five, works the 
Manchester red-light district near her home in Longsight and was 
last arrested for prostitution on April 12. She is also known as 
Hussein and has convictions for soliciting going back to 1986 
and a suspended jail sentence for shoplifting but she has no 
drug convictions. 
  Fury's story is similar to that of Birmingham's Karyn Smith 
and Patricia Cahill, convicted in 1990 and 1991 of trying to 
smuggle heroin out of Thailand. They were pardoned after three 
years in jail.

  [Text] According to the International Narcotics Control 
Committee, the production of opium in Tajikistan has grown by 
more than 1.5 times to reach 650 tons a year since the beginning 
of the war in Afghanistan in December 1979. 
  In addition, well-informed sources in Tashkent told Interfax 
that the quantity of narcotics confiscated during smuggling or 
transit through Uzbekistan in 1992-1993 has increased greatly. 
More than 16 tons of hashish, marijuana, opium and synthetic 
narcotics have been registered in criminal files over this 
period. Since the beginning of this year, ten criminal cases 
have been launched following attempts to smuggle narcotics to 
Uzbekistan.

  [Excerpts] Giorgio Giacomelli, UN deputy secretary-general 
and executive director of the UN fund for drug abuse, visited 
Kyrgyzstan 23-25 May. [passage omitted] 
  Summarizing the results of this visit, Giacomelli emphasized 
that Kyrgyzstan is seriously tackling this issue. The republic 
was the first in the region to establish contacts with the 
United Nations in fighting the spread of drugs. Therefore the 
United Nations is willing to support Kyrgyzstan in addressing 
this issue. 
  The state commission for control over drug trafficking will 
be provided with technical assistance: video films, laboratory 
equipment, and a car, worth a total of $500,000. A special 
program will be adopted which envisions cooperation aimed at 
upgrading legislation related to drug abuse, consultations, 
training of experts, and sharing information. 
  An office of the UN's fund for drug abuse has been set up in 
Tashkent. It will also assist Kyrgyzstan.

  Police in Skopje discovered and confiscated 32 kilograms of 
heroin from a Volkswagen van belonging to Arif Ismaili of Skopje 
on 26 May. The raid took place near the Bellevue hotel on the 
outskirts of the city. 
  According to a police report, the heroin was transported 
from 
Istanbul via the so-called new Balkan east-west land corridor 
and was supposed to be smuggled to Scandinavia through Bulgaria, 
Macedonia, Albania and Italy. (Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service 
in Serbo-Croatian 0838 GMT 28 May 94) 
<H5>  Kyrgyzstan </H5>
  A large batch of opium has been confiscated by Kyrgyz 
security agents on the Kyrgyz-Tajik border. Information about 
the planned drug-trafficking operation was provided to the 
Kyrgyz security services by a confidential source. (Moscow 
ITAR-TASS in English 0917 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
<H5>  Tajikistan </H5>
  In the first 4 months of this year Tajikistan's law 
enforcement agencies destroyed opium poppy on about 164 
hectares, largely in Leninabad region in the country's north. 
  According to data available to the law enforcers, the 
transit 
of narcotics to CIS countries and Europe through Tajikistan has 
considerably increased of late. Narcotics are smuggled largely 
across Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan that lies through 
Gorny Badakhshan, where the terrain is arduous and there are no 
technical installations along the border. (Moscow INTERFAX in

  [Text] Moscow, May 29 (CTK) -- Russian Interior Minister 
Viktor Yerin and his Slovak counterpart Ladislav Pittner, on a 
short official visit to Moscow, signed an inter-ministerial 
agreement on cooperation today. 
  Yerin told journalists that the document "envisaged joint 
operations and information exchanges in fighting the most 
dangerous kinds of crime such as organised crime, economic 
crime, illegal trade in narcotics and arms." 
  Pittner said that by its content the agreement did not 
differ 
from those Slovakia concluded with other countries. "The only 
difference is that it has been worked out more quickly and in 
greater detail and I can say that we have met with far greater 
willingness here than in other cases," he said. 
  The Czech Republic has not yet concluded such an agreement 
with Russia. Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml negotiated the 
preparation of such a document in Moscow last October. A 
Russian Interior Ministry high-ranking official told CTK today 
that Prague "was not efficient enough during the talks." "The 
Slovak interior minister tabled the question as soon as he took 
office. The agreement was prepared very quickly. The Slovaks 
have been more prompt," the official said. 
  Pittner noted that the transformation of the civic systems 
in 
Russia and Slovakia is bringing both countries similar problems. 
"We are interested in cooperation in solving the whole packages 
of problems such as narcotics, dirty money laudering, trade in 
the `white flesh,' prostitution, and the forgery of passports 
and other documents. We seek to solve these problems jointly 
without unnecessarily prolonging the process," he said. 
  Pittner said that beside the so-called Balkan route of drug 
smuggling there appeared an influx of narcotics from the Central 
Asian republics of the former Soviet Union and here we "can 
obtain very valuable information from the Russian Police," he 
said. Pittner pointed out that many citizens from Chechnya and 
the Central Asian countries illegally stay in Slovakia and that 
the agreement creates pre-requisites for solving this problem. 
  Yerin noted that the agreement envisaged joint operations 
aimed at the abolition of the channels of illegal trade in 
narcotics. "New and still little investigated channels of 
narcotic smuggling from Afganistan and the Central Asian 
republics of the former Soviet Union have recently appeared. We 
have gathered great experience of cooperation with our 
colleagues in these countries and all the information will be 
undoubtly provided to our colleagues in Slovakia," the Russian 
minister said. 
  "We have similar agreements with Western countries and their 
importance will be the greater, the better our cooperation with 
the Russian Police, Pittner said. [sentence as received]

<F P=106> [Report by J. Orlando Gomez; from the "Midday Television </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] Despite Colombia's poor image in the realm of human 
rights violations, it is very possible that the EC countries 
will increase its tariff benefits. Because of the huge 
sacrifices Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have made in 
blood and money in the struggle against drug trafficking, the EC 
four years ago established a system that allows these Latin 
American countries' products to enter the 12 EC countries 
without paying tariffs or taxes. Thanks to this measure, a 
considerable amount of Colombian exports are entering the old 
continent without any problem. EC Ambassador Jose Luis Benito 
Prior discussed the issue. 
  [Begin Benito Prior recording] This measure covers over 90 
percent of Colombia's exports, all industrial products, and a 
long list of farm products. Colombia, therefore, can 
congratulate itself for this positive atmosphere. [end 
recording] 
  Thanks to the good work these countries have done in the 
struggle against drug trafficking, these preferential tariffs 
may be extended for another 10 years. 
  [Begin Benito Prior recording] In Europe we appreciate all 
the efforts that Colombia and other Latin American countries are 
making in this struggle. Much must still be done, and together 
we must try to foster a spirit of cooperation. [end recording] 
  These favorable conditions and terms will allow Colombia's 
most competitive products to establish roots on the old 
continent within a few years.

  [Text] According to Minister of Government German Quiroga, 
coca growers are using the industrialization of the coca leaf as 
a pretext for freely marketing this product, in many cases with 
illegal purposes. 
  The coca growers reject the [industrialization] decree 
because it not only restricts the industrialization of coca leaf 
in traditional zones--that is in the Yungas zone in La Paz--but 
also because Article No. 2 states ambiguously that coca leaf is 
penalized in Bolivia. 
  Minister Quiroga asserts that the article is not ambiguous. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] Coca leaf is penalized by Law No. 
1008. [end recording] 
  According to Law No. 1008 the production of coca leaf is 
penalized. According to Article No. 8 of this law, there are 
three regions: The Yungas zone in La Paz is the traditional 
production zone; the Chapare zone in Cochabamba is the 
transition surplus production zone; and the illegal production 
zone entails the whole of Bolivian territory with the exception 
of the two aforementioned zones. 
  [Begin Quiroga recording] There are coca growers who want to 
be completely free to transport it from one place to another, to 
transfer it under the pretext of industrializing it. I told the 
coca growers that if we are successful with the regulation for 
industrialization in the Yungas zone, and if we run short of raw 
materials, then we would take the next step, and immediately 
authorize its industrialization in Chapare. But they do not 
accept this, they want everything. [end recording] 
  The coca growers have announced pressure measures if the 
government does not modify the decree after the COB [Bolivian 
Labor Federation] congress. 
  The government has asserted that there is nothing to modify, 
as this legal tool is the result of consensus and coinciding 
points of view.

  [Text] La Paz, 21 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- The National Social 
Defense Secretariat reported here today (21 May) that a 
"National Border Control Program" will be implemented to monitor 
the import and export of chemical precursors in Bolivia. 
  Victor Hugo Canelas, under secretary for controlled 
substances, noted that the program is still under study and will 
be implemented all year round in regions and zones of the 
country vulnerable to the illegal drug trade. 
  Canelas noted that the program the government is determined 
to implement in the short term will be supported by the United 
Nations and by countries that are "major producers" of chemical 
substances. 
  Canelas added that the program will consolidate logistical 
support for customs checkpoints in border areas having 
difficulties in carrying out their monitoring work. 
  Canelas said: "The proposal envisions training personnel, a 
modernization of communications and liaison, and the 
establishment of permanent customs and police checkpoints." 
  Canelas described remote areas located in the south 
(Yacuiba, 
Villazon), the west (Oruro, Charana, Desaguadero), and the 
Bolivian Amazon (Guayaramerin, Riberalta, and San Matias) as 
"vulnerable points" through which chemical products usually are 
introduced illegally into the country.

  [Text] Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres said 
yesterday that the military units deployed in the Chapare region 
are only carrying out their constitutional mission of watching 
over the country's internal security. He made clear that he did 
not authorize any large deployment, as had been reported by some 
peasant leaders over the last few days. 
  He said that the social situation in that conflictive coca 
growing region requires that the institutions in charge of 
guaranteeing public security take the necessary measures to 
fulfill their objective. 
  Gen. Caceres told PRESENCIA: "I don't know why they are 
making a fuss out of some military movements there. I am the 
one who gives the orders for the Army to move, and I have not 
given any orders in that sense. There are some things, however, 
that should be investigated, but this is a military matter." 
  He said that military deployment anywhere in the country is 
fully supported by the Constitution, and that such action seeks 
only to preserve the constitutional guarantees of the Bolivian 
people. 
  Asked about the official who ordered the military deployment 
in the tropical region of Cochabamba, Gen. Caceres said: "We 
don't need to ask permission of anyone, because to fulfill our 
mission effectively we need to move throughout the entire 
national territory. We do that constantly and routinely, and 
there is no reason why the public should be alarmed. Our 
presence anywhere should not be reason for alarm." 
  He noted: "The Constitution clearly determines the mission 
of the Armed Forces, and we only fulfill that mission." 
  Armed Forces Commander General Fernando Sanjines 
corroborated 
the comments made by Gen. Caceres, saying: "Of course the Armed 
Forces can be in any place at any time, like all the people, but 
basically there is no military deployment, and no order was 
given in that regard." 
  On 19 May Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz said that the 
intelligence services of the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
found indications of the presence in the Chapare region of 
people linked to international drug trafficking, and that they 
are reportedly encouraging the formation of armed irregular 
groups in their service. 
  In this regard the Army commander said this possibility 
should not be dismissed, and admitted that the Army intelligence 
services are evaluating the preliminary intelligence reports. 
  Gen. Caceres said: "Nothing should be dismissed, as such 
indications do exist, which is why we should evaluate and 
investigate the reports. We cannot dismiss anything."

  [Text] National Police Commander General Luis Rocha said 
yesterday that his institution supports the military patrols 
being carried out in the Chapare region since early this week in 
accordance with constitutional regulations. 
  Rocha said: "The Armed Forces belong to the nation, and they 
have the constitutional right to be wherever they want to be in 
accordance with their needs." 
  He said, however, that this does not mean that the Special 
Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) is not capable of keeping order in 
the conflictive region of Chapare, in Cochabamba Department. 
  Asked about the alleged formation of irregular groups 
financed by drug trafficking, General Rocha said that the police 
intelligence services have not confirmed their presence, but 
that the situation is being investigated because of the latent 
threat of criminal groups linked to drug trafficking. 
  He also indicated that the investigation is being carried 
out 
jointly with Army intelligence. Answering reporters, Rocha 
said: "All the actions are of course being coordinated with the 
Armed Forces." 
  He added that the current situation does not demand an 
increase in the FELCN presence in the Chapare. On the contrary, 
he said, there are enough agents there to maintain control over 
any possible conflict.

  [Text] La Paz, 21 May (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Although the 
existence of "a drug cartel" in Oruro Department has been ruled 
out, National Social Defense Secretariat officials conceded here 
today (21 May) that narcotrafficking activities and the 
smuggling of chemical precursors have increased markedly in the 
Republic's western region. 
  Victor Hugo Canelas, the under secretary for controlled 
substances, told LOS TIEMPOS that Oruro has in recent years 
become more of a "corridor for the drug trade" in light of its 
proximity to Chilean regions bordering Bolivia. 
  Canelas said the Special Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) 
intelligence division has long identified the existence of 
"organized rings for drug trafficking" and groups having their 
"epicenter for action" and headquarters in the "red Chapare 
region of Cochabamba Department." 
  Canelas stated: "As a rule, drug traffickers operating in 
our country have close contacts in Chapare and in other major 
centers of the western region and the Bolivian Amazon region."

  [Text] Amalia Pando has a report for us from Santa Cruz on 
a recent operation against drug trafficking involving customs 
and Army personnel. 
  [Being recording] [Pando] Military and customs personnel 
have 
been involved in allowing stolen cars in Brazil and Paraguay to 
enter the country. The vehicles were exchanged for cocaine at 
the border. This ring was discovered during an operation named 
Trebol. Santa Cruz District Prosecutor Francisco Bornstein has a 
report on this case. 
  [Bornstein] More than 20 people have been arrested, 15 
vehicles confiscated, and two car sales lots have been closed 
down. The investigation continues because the ring is very 
large. 
  [Pando] Has the size of the drug trafficking organization 
been established? 
  [Bornstein] This is a ring that even has links with the 
United States and Europe, which is where the drugs are 
definitely sent. This discovery will allow customs authorities 
and Army and police officials to take the necessary measures, as 
some of their personnel are involved, because otherwise it would 
be impossible to bring a vehicle from the Paraguayan or 
Brazilian borders. These vehicles would have to cover certain 
roads where they cannot be found. Those under investigation 
said they handed over sums of money to customs and Army 
personnel. 
  [Pando] This drug trafficking ring has used practically all 
the border posts, and the smaller the post the better for them. 
  [Bornstein] Customs will have to make some corrections in 
the 
control system. It will have to carry out an appropriate 
investigation and control of its personnel. The Army will have 
to do the same, as the vehicles enter the country from Pedro 
Juan Caballero, (Joe), and Eugenio Garay in Paraguay at the 
Bolivian border, where the Army has personnel for carrying out 
control operations. 
  [Pando] The stolen vehicles that were exchanged for cocaine 
were mainly Mitsubishi and Toyota vehicles, and were exhibited 
for sale until last week in two car sales lots in Santa Cruz. 
The two businesses were closed down. Bornstein regretted that 
military officials at the border points were not cooperating as 
they should to identify the military personnel who cooperated 
with this ring of cocaine and stolen car traffickers. He added 
that despite this situation, the names of all the members of 
this ring will soon be known. [end recording]

  [Text] Santiago, 27 May (EFE) -- The police revealed today 
that the most important Chilean drug trafficker, Selim 
Valenzuela Galdames, who got away a few days ago while being 
taken from prison to a hospital for a medical checkup, bribed 
his prison guards to let him escape. 
  Prison guard Alex Valdebenito Carrasco, one of the four 
guards in charge of guarding Valenzuela while he was being taken 
to the hospital, confessed to having received the equivalent of 
$4,700 to let him go. 
  Prison Police Director Claudio Martinez disclosed during a 
news conference today that the four guards involved had been 
dismissed and are now at the disposal of the courts in 
Valparaiso, the main Chilean port, where the drug trafficker 
escaped. 
  Selim Valenzuela is regarded as the mastermind behind a 
shipment to Sweden of 40 kg of cocaine, which was found by the 
Swedish police in the port of Goteborg. 
  The drugs had been packed in 1,750 boxes of raisins, but 
were 
detected by Goteborg customs authorities. 
  Two of the individuals involved in the case, the Chileans 
Jorge Chadwick Vergara and Rene Ramirez Barrientos, who reside 
in Sweden, were sentenced by the Swedish courts to 10 and 9 
years imprisonment respectively. 
  Jose Miguel Vallejos, spokesman for the Chilean 
Investigative 
Police Antinarcotics Directorate, told the local media that 
Valenzuela's escape is "serious," and noted that "he is very 
valuable to the Investigative Police because he is considered 
one of the most important Chilean traffickers due to his 
international links."

  [Text] Santiago, 31 May (EFE) -- Selim Valenzuela, the 
most-wanted Chilean drug trafficker, was recaptured today after 
he escaped on 28 May while being transported to prison from a 
hospital. 
  The Chilean Government's television channel reported today 
that Valenzuela was arrested again by police near Valparaiso, 
the country's main port. Valparaiso is 125 km northwest of 
Santiago. 
  The criminal paid $5,000 to the prison guards taking him 
back 
to prison after he underwent a medical checkup at a Valparaiso 
hospital. 
  Valenzuela, who was detained on 11 March, allegedly has been 
involved in a shipment of 40 kg of cocaine to Sweden in 1992, a 
case in which two other Chileans have been sentenced to a 
10-year prison term in Stockholm.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 1 Jun (DPA) -- The Colombian 
Government indicated today that it will not reconsider its order 
to the Armed Forces to shoot down planes that might be carrying 
drugs--an order which permits the use of force in intercepting 
hostile planes--in response to a U.S. move to stop supplying 
data from radar installations that monitor Colombian and 
Peruvian airspace. 
  Colombian Defense Minister Rafael Pardo said the Colombian 
Government's order was carefully reviewed within the context of 
existing international civil aviation regulations, and, 
therefore, "we do not have to change anything in this matter." 
  The controversy in Colombia and Peru began when it was 
revealed that the U.S. Department of Defense, without consulting 
either the Colombian or Peruvian Governments, suspended the 
operation of radars located in the Amazonian jungle because it 
believed it was dangerous for the Armed Forces of the two 
countries to be authorized to shoot down planes. 
  Spokesmen for President Cesar Gaviria's government reacted 
angrily to the move, calling it "unilateral, untimely, and 
rude." They also argued that it could represent a U.S. violation 
of agreements signed with Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru during the 
so-called Antinarcotics Summits held in Cartagena de Indias and 
San Antonio (Texas). 
  Pardo said the Colombian Government believes it is acting 
properly, and he added that it is still awaiting an official 
answer from the United States on the reasons behind this U.S. 
move before deciding whether it will ask the United States to 
remove two radar installations located in Leticia and Araracuara 
in the Amazonian region. 
  According to unofficial reports published in Colombia, the 
Pentagon's decision was unilateral and prompted concern in the 
White House and State Department because it might lead to an 
increase in drug flights into the United States. 
  Colombian aviation officials who were consulted by the media 
indicated that the U.S. measure might have arisen from fear that 
one of the many U.S. military planes which "constantly violate" 
Colombian airspace might be shot down. 
  Asked about the decision to suspend the release of radar 
data, Army Commander Major General Hernan Guzman said 
authorities will continue to comply with the order to down 
hostile planes, because "while fulfilling our duty, we cannot be 
concerned with what the Americans have to say." 
  The controversy heightened criticisms from Colombian 
political sectors against what they have called 
"inconsistencies" in the Clinton administration's drug policy, 
because, several months ago, the U.S. State Department stopped 
forwarding evidence against drug traffickers after a 
disagreement erupted over statements made by Colombian 
Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 31 May (AFP) -- Today, the local 
newspaper EL TIEMPO indicated that the Colombian Government 
expects an explanation from the United States for its sudden 
decision to suspend the operation of two radars installed in 
Colombia to detect drug planes. This followed the publication 
of the U.S. decision by the THE WASHINGTON POST on 29 May. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, government spokespersons referred to 
Washington's decision as "inconsiderate, untimely, unilateral, 
and rude." THE WASHINGTON POST said that the Pentagon ordered 
the suspension of the operation of four radars used in the fight 
against drug trafficking, which are located in Colombia and 
Peru. In Colombia, the radars are located in Araracuara and 
Leticia, in the southeastern Department of Amazonas. 
  According to EL TIEMPO, since 1 May, the U.S. soldiers who 
operate the radars stopped briefing the Colombian Air Force on 
the flights detected. EL TIEMPO adds that the U.S. Government 
has not officially notified its Colombian counterpart of its 
decision. The Colombian Government asked Washington for an 
explanation 28 days ago, but thus far, it has not received a 
reply, EL TIEMPO discloses. The newspaper also reveals that a 
government spokesperson stated that "it is obvious that if the 
radars are not working, it makes no sense to keep them and the 
technicians on Colombian territory."

<F P=106> [Report by Manuel Gonzalvez; from "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Ruedas has expressed 
surprise at a statement made by a U.S. State Department 
spokesman yesterday. The spokesman said his country has decided 
to suspend the supply of information from the radars that 
operate in Leticia and Aracura because Colombian military 
authorities had downed planes. Minister Pardo Ruedas told 
Caracol the following: 
  [Begin recording] [Pardo Ruedas] Thus, it seems to us 
that.... [pauses] it is a startling decision. We do not have 
any final position apart from the one that a signatory of a 
multilateral agreement has unilaterally decided--without prior 
announcement or explanations--to suspend its participation. 
  [Gonzalvez] Could any preceding events have led the United 
States to make this decision, minister? 
  [Pardo Ruedas] This is what we would like to know. [Words 
indistinct] multilateral cooperation that is advantageous to us 
and other countries. We work on a par with other countries. It 
is advantageous to all those who are interested in controlling 
drug trafficking. We do not understand why a decision has been 
made abruptly and without advising, consulting, or giving 
reasons for it. 
  [Gonzalvez] Perhaps they fear the wrong plane will be downed 
due to information given? 
  [Pardo Ruedas] However, they would have to report this and 
discuss it with us. This decision cannot be based simply on 
[words indistinct] a meeting without, for example, taking into 
account our opinion. [end recording] 
  Other Defense Ministry spokesmen told Caracol that while the 
U.S. Government suspends the supply of radar information to 
Colombia, it congratulates the Peruvian Government each time it 
downs a plane.

  [Text] Christine Shelly, spokeswoman for the U.S. State 
Department's Bureau of International Narcotics Matters, has 
announced that a final decision is not expected before next week 
regarding U.S.-Colombian cooperation on information provided by 
U.S. radar installations in Leticia and Araracuara. Defense 
Minister Rafael Pardo and Air Force Commander Major General 
Alfonso Abondano commented on this topic today at a military 
ceremony. 
  During the ceremony to commemorate the 87th anniversary of 
the Cadets Military Academy, in addition to the traditional 
speeches and parades, there was time to discuss the U.S. radar 
dispute. Amid a downpour that resembled the storm now brewing 
in the country following the Pentagon's orders to suspend the 
operation of the two radar installations, Pardo discounted the 
U.S. position on whether or not unidentified planes should be 
shot down. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] The thing we oppose is that this 
decision was made unilaterally, despite the fact that this 
cooperation program has been in place for three years and that 
it has been a multilateral program. [end recording] 
  According to the defense minister, Colombia will continue to 
shoot down unidentified drug planes, and this policy will not 
change. 
  [Begin Pardo recording] Colombia has assumed this position 
following a thorough, 18-month legal review. We are very much 
convinced that our interpretation is correct, and we sincerely 
believe we have nothing to change in this regard. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the Colombian Air Force says the chances of a 
U.S. 
military plane being shot down are remote. 
  [Begin Abondano recording] We identify all planes visually 
before our pilots are authorized to shoot. [end recording]

  [Text] Since the Cartagena Agreement was signed on 15 
February 1990 on the struggle against drug trafficking--which 
includes the United States, Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia--never 
has such a tense situation been generated among the signatory 
nations as the one observed last weekend between the United 
States, Colombia, and Peru. 
  One month ago, the Pentagon issued an order to suspend 
operations of the two radars that detect aircraft. These radars 
operate in Colombia as a result of that agreement. The same 
decision was made regarding the radars that operate in Peru. 
  This decision--labeled by high-ranking Colombian Government 
spokespersons as "not consulted, untimely, unilateral, and 
discourteous"--has not been officially communicated to the 
authorities by the U.S. Government which has preferred to remain 
silent. 
  The incident began on Sunday, 1 May. On that day, the 
Colombian Air Force officer in charge of radar operations in 
Aracuara and Leticia (Amazonas), officially communicated to the 
Defense Ministry that--without any explication--the passing on 
of information on flights from the radars was being suspended by 
the U.S. military. 
  Since then and up until now, the two Colombian radars have 
not been operating. 
  The order was issued by the Pentagon to the soldiers through 
the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. A high-ranking government 
official said: "The news was baffling although at the beginning 
it was said that the suspension was only for eight days." 
  The following day, a Colombian Government official contacted 
the embassy, which had no official information. At that point 
President Gaviria decided to request a formal explanation for 
what was happening. That was 28 days ago, and no reply has been 
received yet. 
  In Colombia, the matter was handled with confidentiality, 
until Sunday, when U.S. daily THE WASHINGTON POST reported that 
Colombia and Peru "would take reprisals" against the United 
States as a result of its decision to suspend operations of the 
four radars. Those "reprisals" would be the decision to ship out 
of the country two 30-year-old radars that were used in the 
Vietnam War and which have been of no use in the struggle 
against drug trafficking for the past month. A government 
spokesman said that of course the removal of the radars would 
also be accompanied by "a cordial invitation" to the U.S. 
soldiers and experts in charge of their maintenance to leave the 
country. No government official has confirmed or denied that 
decision. A government spokesman consulted by EL TIEMPO, 
however, said that "it is obvious that if the radars are 
useless, there is no sense in keeping them or their technicians 
in Colombian territory." 
  Meanwhile, the authorities know that drug traffickers' 
illegal flights have been on the rise in the past month due to 
the total absence of control in that Amazon area. This is where 
drugs from Bolivia and Peru enter Colombia. 
  The official report on the illegal flights indicate that in 
1993, in that area, 375 aircraft were detected and up until 1 
May this year, 200 flights were reported. This past month an 
average of one illegal flight per day has been added. 
  The government's final determination on the U.S. decision 
will only be adopted when the United States gives a formal 
explanation of what is occurring. In the meantime, it is only 
known that the suspension of radars operations was decided by 
the Pentagon, apparently without the blessing of the State 
Department or the Justice Department. 
  What some government officials fear is that an explanation 
will never be received, therefore Colombia will have to make a 
decision.

  [Text] International treaties are usually agreements 
benefiting two parties; one party cannot decide when to comply 
and when not to. It seems that this is the case now with an 
agreement signed by the United States and Colombia on bases for 
the surveillance of drug trafficking. 
  In this case it was clear that Colombia rendered a service 
to 
the United States and not the other way around. It would be 
preferable for our policy to be increasingly independent, 
because those installations are not useful even for monitoring 
civilian air traffic in Colombia, rather for rendering service 
only to U.S. addicts [viciosos].

  [Text] Cali (Colombia), 2 Jun (EFE) -- Military sources 
have reported the Colombian Army seized 112 kg of cocaine today, 
arresting two people who were transporting the drug in a light 
aircraft in the rural area of the hamlet Guacari (southeastern 
Valle del Cauca). 
  Troops of the 3d Army Brigade, quartered in Cali (capital of 
Valle del Cauca) seized the drug. They found the ultrapure 
cocaine on board a "Piper Seneca" light aircraft, with a 
Colombian license number, that landed at a farm in the region. 
  Sources of the 3d Brigade have reported Alonso Idarraga and 
Leonardo Mejia were arrested during the operation, and air route 
manuals, in addition to the drugs and aircraft, were also seized. 
  The sources added the owners and destination of the drugs 
found inside the aircraft remain unknown.

  [Text] Approximately 30 days after the Constitutional Court 
[CC] legalized personal drug use, the government yesterday 
issued a decree aimed at strengthening essential prevention 
programs and restricting drug consumption and possession in the 
country. 
  Workers will immediately be fired upon proof of drug 
consumption, and professionals will lose their practicing 
licenses. Likewise, the government yesterday banned minors and 
pregnant and breast-feeding women from consuming and possessing 
drugs. It also forbad the use of psychotropic substances at 
elementary and high schools, malls, restaurants, bars, night 
clubs, taverns, recreation centers, and all public places in 
general. 
  All education centers nationwide were granted a 30-day 
period 
to adopt the necessary measures to curb drug consumption in any 
of its forms as part of their internal statutes. The government 
also banned drug consumption in all sports activities in the 
country. The same measure applies to prisons, businesses, and 
other workplaces. 
  According to the decree, those who violate restrictions on 
drug consumption could be admonished, fined, and even expelled 
from where they are, whether a school or a public place. In 
addition, the government decided those who are caught driving a 
vehicle while under the influence of drugs could be detained by 
authorities for a period of up to 24 hours and sentenced to pay 
a minimum of up to 20 salaries. In addition, their driver 
licenses could even be suspended. 
  Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez said last night: "Drug 
consumption is not a basic right, but we are warning the 
objective of the decree is merely to establish certain 
restrictions to the CC ruling rather than challenging it." Those 
laws that penalize drug sales, trafficking, production, and 
distribution within the country are in effect, and the 
government will not hesitate to enforce them on those who 
violate them. 
  Meanwhile, Drug Director Gabriel de Vega Pinzon has said 
strategies of integral production against drug addiction will be 
reinforced to protect the people's basic rights, which could be 
affected by drug problems. He added that within the framework 
of antidrug strategies, we are progressing in tangible 
prevention and rehabilitation programs in Medellin, Atlantico, 
Caldas, Cali, Huila, and Santander. 
<H5>  Restrictions </H5>
  The decree prohibits drug possession, trafficking, and 
consumption in the country's public and private schools. School 
officials will be in charge of reporting cases of drug 
possession and consumption. In case minors are caught with 
drugs, school officials will notify their parents. Student 
penalties could range from admonition to expulsion, including 
suspension. Moreover, all schools will include drug prevention 
subjects in their curriculum. 
  Governors and mayors, with the coordination of the Education 
Ministry, will verify the development of prevention programs at 
schools and impose pertinent disciplinary measures. 
  Drug use and consumption were banned from public places, 
including theaters and stadiums, as well as ships, planes, 
government offices, restaurants, bars, night clubs, hotels, and 
parks. Managers and directors of public places will be able to 
expel drug consumers. Those public places that allow drug 
consumption will be temporarily closed for up to 30 days. 
  Drugs whose effects enhance athletic performance, reduce 
anxiety, and artificially diminish exhaustion cannot be used in 
any sport activities. Doctors who prescribe these type of 
substances to athletes will no longer be able to practice in the 
country. 
  Those who drive under the influence of drugs will be 
sentenced to pay up to 20 minimum monthly salaries, and their 
driver licenses will be suspended for up to a year. They will 
also be detained for 24 hours. 
  No public or private employee will be able to go to his 
workplace under the influence of drugs or to consume them while 
working. Violating this regulation will lead employers to breach 
his contract. 
  The decree also stipulates prison inmates are forbidden from 
possessing or consuming drugs and psychotropic substances, as 
stipulated by Law No. 65 of 1993, the Penitentiary Code. 
  After medical, psychological, and psychiatric evaluations 
are 
made, prison medical services will include rehabilitation 
treatment for inmates who are consuming psychotropic substances 
in order to help them recover. This regulation does not exempt 
them, however, from being penalized, as stipulated by the law. 
  Penitentiary and surveillance guard members who are caught 
consuming or possessing drugs or who bring drugs to prisons will 
be fired. Disciplinary measures will be taken as well. 
  From now on, those who request gun licenses will be given a 
psychological and physical aptitude test. In case they are 
found to be drug or psychotropic substance addicts, their 
licenses will be revoked. Furthermore, those who bear arms, 
explosives, or ammunition under the influence of these 
substances will be sentenced to pay up to the minimum of one 
monthly salary, although this does not mean they are exempt from 
disciplinary measures. 
  Gun licenses will be permanently revoked from second 
offenders, as stipulated by Decree 2535 of 1993. 
  The Minors Protection Code stipulates minors, pregnant or 
breast-feeding women, and those who are considered unstable 
according to the Civil Code are forbidden from consuming drugs. 
The regulation indicates women in either one of these two 
conditions or minors who consume drugs will be sent to a family 
counselor who will be able to reprimand the dependent minors' 
parents, to grant custody to a close relative, to place them in 
a foster home or a special protection center, or even to begin 
procedures to adopt neglected minors. 
  These measures are aimed at guaranteeing personal care and 
abating the perils that may threaten minors' health and morale. 
  Those who are caught driving under the influence of drugs or 
other substances will be sentenced to pay the minimum of 20 
equivalent salaries, and their driver licenses will be suspended 
for up to a year. They will even be arrested for 24 hours, and 
their vehicles will be impounded. 
  Likewise, those who, through a medical examination, are 
found 
addicted to any psychotropic substance will not get their 
licenses renewed, and those who, after obtaining their licenses, 
become addicts or second offenders in illegal possession of 
ammunition, arms, or explosives will get their licenses revoked. 
  Heads of public offices are authorized to unilaterally 
breach 
work contracts when public employees go to their workplaces 
under the influence of any substance or when they consume or 
incite others to consume drugs in the workplace. 
  Furthermore, all public employees of sound mind are 
forbidden 
from using and consuming drugs and psychotropic substances. 
They will be penalized as stipulated by Decree-Law 2400 of 1968 
and by other regulations that supervise public posts. 
  The consumption of psychotropic substances and drugs is also 
forbidden to those who, due to the nature of their jobs or 
professions, impose risks to others. 
  The Decree includes in this category drivers of any type of 
vehicle, pilots, ship captains, aviation students, flight 
instructors, machinists and operators, doctors, dentists, and 
other health professionals who deal with or tend combustible or 
flammable materials and substances, including explosives, toxic, 
poisonous, corrosive, or radioactive substances, as well as 
those who bear or ship arms, air traffic controllers and 
operators, and all ground plane maintenance and support 
technicians. 
  The violation of these regulations by these professionals 
will lead to the suspension, disqualification, or revocation of 
the license or permit to practice their professions. 
  The family, community, society, and state will be 
responsible 
for promoting or implementing policies geared toward avoiding 
and undermining the causes and consequences of drug consumption. 
  This is why the National Drug Council will have to evaluate 
the scope of the problem and coordinate with other governmental 
institutions projects of prevention and programs that will be 
implemented locally, regionally, and nationally. 
  The country's radio and television stations will also have 
to 
air campaigns aimed at fighting drug trafficking and consumption 
as often and as long as the National Drug Council deems 
convenient. 
  To that effect, the government ordered the council to issue, 
within 30 days, pertinent regulations and asked the 
Communications Ministry to continue to promote and develop 
communication strategies to overcome this problem; besides, the 
Health Ministry, secretariats, and departmental services will 
embark on rehabilitation campaigns and programs at the level of 
their treatment facilities. 
  Finally, public and private employers must conduct permanent 
prevention campaigns to make preventive measures effective, and 
they must let authorities inspect and investigate as needed.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 31 May (DPA) -- The Colombian 
Government today issued a decree restricting the possession and 
consumption of narcotics in public places. This practice was 
recently authorized by a Constitutional Court ruling, which 
concluded that it is illegal to apply jail sentences and fines 
to individuals found to be in possession of personal doses of 
drugs. 
  Today's announcement was made by Justice Minister Andres 
Gonzalez, who said the decree includes several provisions 
designed to challenge the high court's controversial ruling. 
The decision was rejected by the government, political circles, 
economic groups, the media, and several social circles. 
  Gonzalez indicated that the authorities will prohibit the 
consumption of drugs in public places. Those who violate the 
measure will be removed from the premises. The owner of the 
establishment will be punished with the closure of his or her 
business and the suspension of his or her operators license. 
  The minister said the use of drugs will not be permitted in 
places such as schools; cultural, recreation, and amusement 
centers; on board ships and airplanes; in restaurants; or on the 
street. 
  In the realm of sports, Gonzalez said the decree, which was 
signed by President Cesar Gaviria, also prohibits the use of 
drugs by athletes attempting to improve their performance. The 
authorities will apply stiff penalties to violators, their 
trainers, and the doctors who endorse such consumption. 
  Gonzales added that operators of motor vehicles and airplane 
pilots found to be under the effects of narcotics will have 
their licenses suspended. Those appearing for work under the 
influence will be fired. 
  The decree is the first practical measure adopted by 
President Gaviria to head off the Constitutional Court ruling, 
which legalized the possession and consumption of drugs. The 
court based its decision on the right that all Colombians have, 
as outlined in the Constitution, to freely develop their 
individual personality. The ruling annulled an article of the 
Drug Law that mandated jail terms of 30 days to one year and 
fines equivalent to $62 for those individuals caught carrying 
quantities of less than 20 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of 
hashish, 2 grams of methaqualone, and 1 gram of cocaine. 
  In rejecting the ruling, Gaviria said the Constitutional 
Court was mistaken to call drug consumption a "right" and to 
establish the supremacy of individual interests over public 
welfare. Several days ago, Gaviria indicated that his 
administration will promote a referendum to have Colombian 
people decide for themselves whether or not to reform the 
constitutional article that provides the right to individual 
personality development, which would automatically annul the 
court's decision. To this end, Gaviria signed a law on 
mechanisms for a popular consultation. The law authorizes the 
government to promote and present motions that are signed by 
several million citizens before Congress to request referendums. 
  Several justices of the Constitutional Court have criticized 
the president's attempts to prevent the legalization of drug 
use. They say their decisions are not subject to appeal and must 
be upheld. Meanwhile, an association of criminal lawyers has 
complained before Congress about the president's alleged 
"contempt" of court.

<F P=106> [Article by Ineke Holtwijk and Jeroen Trommelen: "Colombian </F>
Police Have Suspected Netherlands Company For Years"] 
  [Text] Bogota/Amsterdam -- Holanda Colombia is a subsidiary 
of Holland Chemical International. The company was founded 
about 30 years ago in South America and imports chemicals for 
the paint and pharmaceutical industries, among others. 
  According to the chief of the Colombian National Police, 
General Octavio Vargas Silva, many of what Holanda Colombia 
considers to be legal customers are essentially dummy companies 
which exist merely to lend illegal transactions a legal 
appearance on paper. 
  The Colombian police have had their suspicions about Holanda 
Colombia's services for several years. Five years ago, General 
Miguel Antonio Padilla, who was chief of police at the time, 
said on Netherlands television that the Netherlands chemical 
industry was one of the main suppliers to the cocaine barons. 
  The evidence lies in the packaging, the barrels, and the 
route followed, said General Padilla at the time. He did not 
wish to name names because the inquiry had still not been 
concluded. 
  Concrete steps against the Netherlands-Colombian company 
were 
taken on 10 March this year, when operation "Volatile" was 
launched (the name was chosen because of the volatile substances 
in question). The National Council for Narcotic Drugs, which 
has to give its approval to companies trading in substances that 
can be of use to drug dealers, withdrew the licence it had 
issued to Holanda Colombia. 
  The police then raided the company's eight plants spread 
throughout the country. In Mosquera, Medellin, Baranquilla, 
Cali, Bucaramanga, Pereira, Cartagena, and Ibaque a total of 
1,753 tonnes of chemicals were confiscated. 
  The excuse for this was the fact that the company had made a 
delivery to another company that supposedly lacked the required 
authorization. In a second incident, a quantity of methyl ethyl 
ketone [MEK] was supposedly ordered by one company and paid for 
by another. 
  In the meantime, claims company spokesman Takkenberg, both 
incidents have been cleared up. "The authorization had indeed 
been withdrawn from the first company. But when we made the 
delivery in February the authorization was still valid. In the 
second case, both companies did indeed possess the required 
papers." 
  At a press conference the day after the operation, General 
Octavio Vargas Silva announced that the Colombian police had 
"dealt a serious blow" to this sector of the drug trade. The 
police report specified the haul in kg. The list ranges from 
ether and sodium to thinner and toluene. 
  The semifinished product coca paste, made of leaves of the 
coca plant, and refined cocaine can be produced using various 
chemicals. 
  MEK is the big favorite of the drug dealers. According to an 
investigation carried out by the DEA, the American anti-drug 
department, 90 percent of the cocaine encountered in the United 
States contains this substance. Holanda Colombia's warehouses 
contained 941,704 kilos of MEK. 
  However, according to H. Bolhuis, the Netherlands director 
of 
industrial development at Holanda Colombia, the fact that the 
police throw several chemicals together shows that they are 
ill-informed. The trained chemist points out that the list even 
included hydrochloric acid, as if the drug trade was interested 
in that. 
  Bolhuis works at a small, but modern factory in Mosquera, a 
town where the industrial belt begins behind the colonial 
square. With its concrete and angular glass dome, the factory 
is of a design that one might formerly have expected more in the 
Hoofddorp business park than on a sandy path in the Colombian 
savannah. 
  The chemist fervently hopes that the entire affair can be 
dealt with quickly and "amicably." The fact that the public 
prosecutor has not yet charged the company and its staff members 
after a period of three months, strengthens his conviction in 
this respect. In Colombia, the prosecutor has 180 days to make 
a decision as to whether to proceed with a legal investigation. 
  The company has protested to the judge at the withdrawal of 
its authorization to deal in strategic substances. 
  The British director of Holanda Colombia, G. Bromich, adds 
that 90 percent of the Colombian chemical industry is being 
supplied by his company. The chemical substance MEK accounts 
for a maximum of 4 percent of the company's sales, and is, he 
claimed, also sold by major companies such as Exxon and Shell. 
  According to Bromich, the company is probably the leading 
seller of filled barrels in Colombia, which is supposedly why so 
many of the company's barrels had been found in cocaine 
laboratories. 
  The police file on Holanda Colombia contains a pile of color 
photographs including data and place names that provide 
convincing proof of this. 
  The pictures are barely distinguishable. A luxurious green 
forest, a cane shelter, and underneath it row upon row of green 
barrels bearing the initials HC--Holanda Colombia--in white. 
  The pictures show improvised small-scale cocaine factories 
that were closed down by the army or the police during the past 
years. Nine times out of 10, Holanda Colombia barrels were found 
there, sometimes brand new ones. 
  The barrels could be stolen, or the chemicals transferred to 
the barrels, concede the Colombian experts involved in the 
anti-drugs war in Bogota. However, they claim that this is just 
one theory, and that "100,000 liters is too large a quantity to 
be explained away like that."

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- General Finlander Armijo Ucles, 
inspector general of the Armed Forces, has warned that announced 
personnel and budget cuts in the Armed Forces place state 
security at risk. After noting that the government and the Armed 
Forces are in charge of keeping public order and preserving 
state security, he said this duty is being reduced more and more 
with each budget cut and every time a combat unit is disbanded. 
  He said those who have suggested such cuts have not taken 
into account the great harm being done to the country. "But we 
obey all orders from the president without question," he added. 
He also said there are no disputes within the Armed Forces over 
the crisis that the institution is experiencing. "There are no 
blocs that either favor or oppose the restrictions." 
  All of the men have become highly professional because of 
the 
training of troops in several exercises conducted jointly with 
the U.S. Army support. No special training for troops or 
officers can be completed if U.S. economic aid is reduced, he 
said. 
  Gen. Armijo Ucles said the equipment used by the Public 
Security Force belongs to the Armed Forces. Therefore, these 
arms will have to be returned to the Army once the Attorney 
General's Office takes control of the police. He added, "The 
decision could be changed, however, providing the government and 
the Higher Council reach a better understanding." 
  He said he wished the new police force a good start. "We are 
awaiting the results. We hope the crime rate will not increase, 
because this would present problems for a new and inexperienced 
police force." 
  Gen. Armijo Ucles also expressed his concern for the members 
of the National Investigations Directorate [DNI], "most of whom 
will enter the ranks of the unemployed." He warned about the 
possibility of jobless DNI agents being hired by drug 
traffickers or becoming ruffians whose activities could disrupt 
the country's order and democratic system. 
  He said the Armed Forces General Command will soon meet with 
the executive to outline a plan to hire the dismissed police 
officers. Otherwise, the people will have to deal with criminal 
gangs in which Armed Forces-trained agents could become death 
squad members or drug traffickers.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 4 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The United Nations 
informed Honduras that ships bearing the Honduran flag are 
violating the embargo against Haiti, an official Honduran 
government source confirmed today, Saturday. 
  The Honduran Foreign Ministry received a note from this 
international organization regarding the presence of at least 
five Honduran-flagged ships off the Haitian coasts that are 
supplying that country with fuel and other materials. 
  Merchant Marine Superintendent Reynaldo Flores said the 
ships 
were identified as Erma, Sea Wind II, Aida Luz, Lady Sandra III, 
and Rooster. 
  Flores said "we cannot impede" the presence of ships 
registered under the Honduran flag because they are flagged for 
legal activities and "we have no way of knowing if they commit 
illegal activities." 
  One of the ships, the Rooster, had previously been detained 
for drug trafficking, the Honduran Merchant Marine Office 
confirmed. 
  Deputy Carlos Sosa Coello of the Innovation and Unity Party 
warned that the United Nations could penalize Honduras for this 
event.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran-flagged 
ships were found carrying fuel to Haiti, thus violating the 
embargo the UN Security Council imposed on that country, 
authorities admitted today. Carlos Sosa Coello, chairman of the 
Chairman of the National Drug Interdiction Committee, told 
NOTIMEX "there are Honduran ships that illegally smuggle Chinese 
citizens into the United States and others transport fuel to 
Haiti." 
  Sosa Coello charged that ships registered in Honduras were 
also detected in international waters carrying drugs. The 
Honduran National Congress is getting ready to discuss the 
existing Merchant Marine Law through which a government leases 
its flag to foreign businessman who request it. The military 
controls the merchant marine, and the civilian government 
receives no income from the registering of foreign ships. 
  The military does not provide or report on the amounts of 
money they earn for leasing the national flag, but sources at 
the Congress said the business could yield close to $40 million 
a year. "We have an open registry of merchant vessels in 
Honduras, from which every one profits except the treasury," 
Sosa Coello indicated. 
  Nelman Sabillon, secretary of the Maritime Commission of the 
Foreign Ministry, said that since 1993 ships flying the Honduran 
flag have violated the then "partial" agreement to put a 
blockade on Haiti. 
  The U.S. Coast Guard informed the Honduran government that 
in 
1993 it intercepted Honduran-flag vessels carrying fuel to 
Haiti. Bilateral agreements allow the United States to 
intercept and come aboard Honduran vessels and aircraft in 
international waters within the efforts the two countries are 
making to fight drug trafficking. Sabillon also disclosed that 
the previous month Japanese authorities filed a complaint 
against the Honduran-flag vessel Montana for carrying 60 Chinese 
nationals who were trying to enter the United States. Honduras 
has to deal with complaints from the United States, Japan, 
Canada, and France that Honduran-flag vessels are fishing 
illegally in their territorial waters to the detriment of their 
fishing resources, the Foreign Ministry official indicated.

  [Text] Commissioner of Police Colonel Trevor MacMillan said 
yesterday the police have identified 27 drug gangs in Jamaica, 
which are controlled mostly by deportees. The police have 
declared war on these gangs, on illegal drugs and on drug 
trafficking, he said. 
  "I cannot say much about the police plans, but we have 
identified some 27 gangs linked to drugs and who are operating 
in the Corporate Area, the Commissioner told THE GLEANER. 
  Metropolitan Crime Officer, Senior Superintendent Forbes, 
said the thrust in apprehending the drug "lords" will be 
intelligence-driven. This was in keeping with the recent 
statement by Minister of National Security and Justice, K.D. 
Knight, that the new type of policing will depend mostly on 
intelligence. 
  Some of the communities identified by the police where the 
drug gangs operate out of are: Central Kingston, Tivoli Gardens, 
Upper Oxford Street, Hannah Town, Jones Town, Waterhouse and 
McIntyre Villa in the Kingston 16 area. 
  Information reaching THE GLEANER is that some of these 
communities are now being probed by the police. 
  Mr. Forbes said in the past there have been speculations as 
to the link between drugs and guns, but the police have now 
positively established that there is a link, as in some cases 
drug money is used to purchase guns. 
  The Anti-Narcotic Department of the Force will play a major 
role in the drive against these drug gangs. The Division was the 
recipient of 18 new motor vehicles and some communication 
equipment yesterday. 
  The vehicles include eight Toyota Corollas, four Isuzu 
Troopers, two Isuzu double-cab pick-ups, one Isuzu single cab 
pick-up, one Hiace 15 seater bus, one Toyota panel van and one 
Isuzu five-ton truck. They were donated to the Ministry of 
National Security and Justice by the United Nations 
International Drug Control Programme. 
  Mr. Knight said the police have been working hard and wanted 
to double their efforts to combat the drug problem. 
  Last year, the police recovered 80.79 kilograms of cocaine, 
673 pieces of crack, one kilogram of heroin and 123.93 kilograms 
of hash oil; and a total of 6,915 persons were arrested by the 
police for breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act.

  [Text] A Corporate Area businessman, who allegedly gave two 
prominent young men a quantity of ganja to take to the United 
States, was arrested yesterday and charged with breaches of the 
Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  A police source said Christopher Moore, 23, accompanied by 
his attorney, turned himself in to the police and was arrested 
and charged with possession of ganja, dealing in and taking 
steps to export the drug. 
  Moore, son of Charles Moore who owns Moore's Transport Ltd., 
on Hagley Park Road, St. Andrew, is booked to appear in the 
Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton Street this morning. 

<H5>    A Link </H5>
  Moore's arrest is linked to the arrest Wednesday of Bryan 
Bernal, the 20-year-old son of Jamaica's Ambassador to the 
United States, Dr. Richard Bernal, and a juvenile relative, for 
breaches of the Dangerous Drugs Act. 
  The young men were held with 45.45 kilograms of ganja 
disguised as pineapple juice as they were being processed to 
leave the Norman Manley International Airport for Washington D.C. 
  However, they contend that they were given the tins, packed 
into two cartons, to deliver to the relative of an acquaintance 
in Washington D.C. The police had been trying to find the person 
who allegedly gave the young men the contraband. 
  In the meantime, the after-dark bail Wednesday of Bryan 
Bernal and a juvenile relative has raised many eyebrows in legal 
circles. 

<H5>    Unprecedented </H5>
  Lawyers say it is unprecedented that persons charged in 
connection with the trafficking of significant amounts of drugs 
be offered "station" bail. 
  Although the police have the power to grant bail, they 
invariably remand persons caught attempting to smuggle drugs and 
allow the court to decide if bail should be granted and in what 
amount. 
  Alleged traffickers, mostly foreigners have consistently 
been 
denied bail in the past, but some Jamaicans whose attorneys have 
been able to convince the court that they will turn up for their 
trial have been offered bail, usually with conditions attached, 
such as surrendering travel documents and reporting to the 
police each week. 
  At Hunt's Bay Police Station Bryan Bernal and the other 
accused were each offered $500,000 bail Wednesday night. 
  They were freed on bail, about 10 hours after they were held 
with the drug packed into 96 tins, labelled pineapple juice, 
among their luggage. 
  When they appeared in the Kingston Criminal Court at Sutton 
Street yesterday, Resident Magistrate Norma Von Cork extended 
their bail until next Thursday, April 14. 
  Their Jamaican passports were seized as a condition of bail. 
  An application by defence counsel Richard Small for the two 
to be given permission to return to the United States to 
continue their studies was turned down by the magistrate. Mr. 
Small submitted that Bryan, an architectural student, was due to 
sit examinations this month. 
  Mr. Small and attorney-in-law Stephen Shelton are appearing 
for the accused. Clerk of the Courts Linda Wright is 
representing the Crown.

<F P=106> [By Julian Rodriguez Marin] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 28 May (EFE) -- Drug trafficking has 
permeated all Mexican political structures and has corrupted 
federal, state, and municipal officials who commercialize the 
application of justice, Eduardo Valle, who resigned from the 
post of adviser to the attorney general for this reason, has 
told EFE. 
  When asked by EFE if he is afraid that drug traffickers 
might 
make an attempt on his life for making these accusations, he 
answered: "If they want to kill you, they will. I walk around 
without protection, without bullet-proof vests or bodyguards." 
  The Attorney General's Office (PGR) was able to obtain the 
most complete information on drug trafficking in Mexico, but it 
was unable to eradicate drug trafficking because government 
structures at all levels are corrupted by drug money, the former 
adviser said. 
  "Narco-power" has deformed the economy; it is a cancer that 
has generated economic, financial, and political dependence, 
which instead of producing goods has created serious problems 
and distortions ultimately affecting honest businessmen, Valle 
said. 
  "The struggle against drug trafficking is a problem like 
physics; there is no absolute vacuum, when one group is 
eliminated another immediately takes its place," he affirmed. 
  "Narco-power" has permeated the political structure; the 
three most important drug trafficking groups--the groups of 
Amado Carrillo, Arellano Felix, and Juan Garcia Abrego--which 
are accused of approximately 35 killings and about 200 murders, 
have a bearing on the main decisions of the country, the former 
adviser revealed. 
  Eduardo Valle, who was a leader in the 1968 student movement 
and in the Mexican Workers Party, said that no one can knowingly 
sponsor an initiative against drug trafficking because if he 
does, he will die. 
  Valle, known in political circles by his student nickname, 
"El Buho" [The Owl], explained he will leave the PGR without any 
protection. He has been a federal deputy and president of the 
Union of Democratic Journalists. 
  "Neither bullet-proof vests nor several bodyguards; my only 
protection is my fellow journalists," Valle remarked. 
  "I came to the PGR committed to fighting against drug 
trafficking. Regrettably, I was criticized for that decision, 
but they must know the problem is not where you are, but what do 
you do, how committed you are," Valle added. 
  "I came to fight without hesitation against drug trafficking 
networks, and I am leaving because it is impossible to eradicate 
these groups, since they have infiltrated all sectors," Valle 
asserted. He added it would be suicidal and a massacre would 
occur if there were an attempt to try and enter the domains of 
the mafia without the support of all police forces. 
  Valle said that at least 10 drug cartels are operating in 
Mexico, although the most important ones are three that maintain 
ties with the Cali Cartel (Colombia) and the incipient Peru 
Cartel. These organizations handle thousands of millions of 
dollars. 
  The Arellano Felix organization has links to the most 
important drug trafficking mafias in the world, with Europe, and 
with the group of Asian nations called the "golden triangle of 
drug trafficking" (Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma), Valle noted. 
  Drug trafficking organizations have employed government 
officials at all levels, representatives of the legislative and 
judiciary branches, and representatives of Mexican security 
forces, Valle expressed. 
  During the "golden period," between 1988 and 1989, the 
Matamoros Cartel led by Juan Garcia Abrego introduced six tons 
of cocaine weekly into the United States. It is estimated over 
100 tons were introduced annually. 
  The Matamoros Cartel security chief is former Navy officer 
Rafael Olvera, "El Rafles," who heads a small army of 70 
well-equipped and well-armed men. 
  Pedro Aspe Armella, Mexico's secretary of finance and public 
credit, has admitted in the United States the influence of drug 
trafficking in all structures of political and social life in 
Mexico. "And the secretary came up short, because drug 
trafficking not only infiltrates the federal government, but 
also state and municipal governments, as well as national 
legislative, executive, and judicial branches," the former 
adviser remarked. 
  Drug trafficking groups in Mexico have grown and handle not 
only tons of cocaine, but also hundreds of tons of marijuana 
that are planted throughout the country. 
  Valle regretted that the presidential candidates have not 
properly addressed this cancer and have not presented a 
political project proposing an all-out war against drug 
trafficking. So far only church representatives have demanded 
an all-out struggle against drug trafficking.

  [Text] Mexico City, May 31 (AFP) -- Mario Ruiz, the deputy 
attorney general of the Republic, stated this Tuesday, that drug 
trafficking in Mexico is controlled by four large groups that 
have "all the economic and technological resources to conduct 
their activities." 
  In an interview given to the Monitor newscast, the official 
admitted that the powerful Mexican traffickers have a 
"corruption mattress" among the police and they also have "ties 
with international capos." 
  The Mexican capos are the Arellano Felix brothers of the 
Tijuana cartel, Hector Palma of the Sinaloa cartel, Juan Garcia 
Abrego of the Tamaulipas cartel, and Amado Cardillo of the 
Juarez cartel, the deputy attorney general stated. 
  Ruiz, who recently gave Federal Judicial Police [PJF] 
members 
a one-month ultimatum to arrest the drug chieftains, said the 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) is attempting to break the 
intermediate structures of the bands. He pointed out that, 
until the capos are arrested, the authorities will attempt to 
interrupt the flow of money and drugs to the cartel chieftains. 
  The deputy attorney general said getting to the capos is 
very 
difficult as they have a "corruption mattress" as well as "all 
the economic and technological resources to move about and even 
to leave the country and return. It is, thus, very difficult to 
search for them." However, he added, "when we arrest 
intermediate drug traffickers, they will give us information 
that will allow us to achieve bigger objectives." 
  Ruiz admitted the struggle against drug trafficking is an 
endless war but as long as the institutions and the PGR continue 
to battle they will be able to control the situation and, in 
principle, stop drug-trafficking activities from growing. 
  Last week end, Ruiz demanded that the PJF, in charge of the 
fight against drug traffickers, arrest the drug chieftains. 
Ruiz said that if the PJF does not make arrests, they will be 
charged with negligence or complicity and they will be subjected 
to justice. He explained there is evidence tying policemen with 
organized crime but he asserted that most of the PJF members are 
honest. He said the PGR is determined to get results such as a 
large quantity of drugs seized and the arrest of more drug 
traffickers.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Guillermo Knochenhauer] </F>
  [Text] The week's news regarding the drug traffic: the DEA 
investigation to learn whether one of Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
collaborators is linked with that activity; the discovery of a 
plot by the Arellano Felix brothers to kill Hernandez Galicia, 
alias "La Quina," in jail, and to foist the blame on President 
Carlos Salinas; the disclosure on Wednesday, 10 days after its 
occurrence, of the reason given by Eduardo Valle Espinosa for 
his resignation as adviser to Attorney General Diego Valades, 
citing the economic, political, and social influence attained by 
drug traffickers and the government's powerlessness to prevent 
it; and, finally, the Salinas meeting with Baja California's 
governor, on Thursday, has two possible readings. They are not 
necessarily contradictory. 
  One might be that the public is being prepared to accept the 
story that the drug trafficking business assassinated Colosio. 
To make this credible, it would have to be based on the second 
reading that we, the government and society together, are 
compelled to make of this dreadful phenomenon. 
  The question that we must all put to the authorities is 
asked 
by Eduardo Valle of Attorney General Valades: "When will we have 
the courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people 
that we are suffering from a kind of `narco'-democracy? Will we 
have the intellectual capacity and ethical fortitude to assert 
that Amado Carrillo, the Arellano Felix brothers, and Juan 
Garcia Abrego are, inconceivably and degradingly, promoters and 
even supporters of our economic growth and social development? 
  President Salinas's government has fought the drug traffic 
with determination, dealing it severe blows. However, by so 
doing it has only managed to disrupt the balance of power that 
existed among the various gangs, giving rise to a bloody battle 
for supremacy among them. Second, it has made the business more 
powerful every day because, by its very nature, it grows all the 
more as the illegality in which it operates increases. 
  Let us observe some of the publicly known data: A report on 
the Mexican Government's action against the drug traffic during 
1991 states that, in that year, drugs with a street value twice 
that of the nation's total debt were seized. From 1989 to 1991, 
over 60,000 criminals associated with the drug trade were 
arrested, and more than 20,000 weapons and nearly 10,000 cars 
were confiscated. Today, the profits accrued from drug 
distribution in our territory amount to $27 billion per year: a 
figure exceeding the GDP [gross domestic product] of Costa Rica 
and of many other countries. The Gulf cartel alone, which 
Eduardo Valle was supposed to be dismantling, has over $10 
billion in funds, and an army exceeding 500 heavily armed men, 
not to mention its influence on the police and politics in the 
region. 
  The drug traffic and that of the weapons to equip those 
engaged in it are two inseparable phenomena that are producing 
armies like the ones keeping Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru in a 
state of civil war. The experience of those countries, and of 
our own, in fighting drug production under the pressure of the 
consuming countries, proved, a long time ago, that the drug 
business can be understood only in its international dimension, 
and that the deciding factor is not production, but rather, 
consumption. In other words, the isolated battle being waged by 
the producing countries or those used for transit to the market 
is doomed to failure in advance, so long as there are consumers 
willing to pay the price of the drugs: 95 percent of which 
consists of the risk premium left in the distributors' hands, 
with only 5 percent representing production and processing costs. 
  Reacting to the DEA investigations whereby the United States 
was attempting to intensify its pressure on the Mexican 
Government, Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] presidential candidate, countered by 
declaring that the governments of consuming countries should 
expend a greater effort to combat the drug traffic. To end the 
fabulous business, with its criminal damage to the economic, 
political, and social life of countries, unfortunately including 
Mexico, there is only one method: its decriminalization. No 
nation can do this unilaterally. The problem can be solved only 
on the international level and, if this has not been achieved, 
it is not for want of imagination, but rather because the drug 
traffickers' influence in the consuming nations does not allow 
it. Their power can be better understood if one has the capacity 
to imagine that the business, on a worldwide scale, turns over 
approximately $800 billion per year. That is almost two and a 
half times Mexico's GDP: money without which the international 
financial system as we know it now would not be operating.

  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 1 Jun -- Mario Ruiz Massieu, 
deputy attorney general of the Republic, said that police 
commanders or policemen who arrest drug traffickers will receive 
a reward, but admitted that his office "does not have the means 
or the capacity to compete with the corruption funds offered by 
the drug cartels." 
  Ruiz Massieu reiterated that Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
officials who do not work will be fired and that, in the event 
that their links to drug traffickers are proved, action will be 
taken against them. Ruiz Massieu told members of the Nuevo Leon 
Lawyers Association (CANL) that since Jorge Carpizo joined the 
PGR and later became Government Secretary he has encouraged 
citizens to view the institution "with trust and not with 
terror." 
  He said that regardless of the established inertia and 
faults 
there is confidence that the PGR can become the institution that 
all Mexicans want. Ruiz Massieu asked lawyers and citizens to 
criticize and point out faults and deficiencies so that all PGR 
officials and agents do their duty, if not by conviction, then 
at least out of fear of being exposed. 
  After meeting with CANL members, the federal official 
reiterated in an interview that the call made a few days ago to 
PGR delegates and deputies, as well as to Federal Judicial 
Police commanders, was not an ultimatum, "they simply were told 
that they must know who the most important drug traffickers are 
in the states where they work, because their work is to 
investigate and they should know all these networks." 
  Therefore, he added, they should yield results, and these 
should begin to be seen in about four weeks. If by then no 
results are seen, he reiterated, "we will analyze whether or not 
this is due to incompetence or negligence, or because they are 
covering up and are accomplices; this is what I said and what I 
am repeating." 
  He added that officials who manage to arrest drug 
traffickers 
will receive a reward, but the PGR does not have the capacity or 
means to equal or surpass what the criminals may offer. He said 
that the desire to earn a reward and the commitment to work and 
serve society as citizens and human beings must be combined. 
  Afterward, in a meeting with local business members of the 
Nuevo Leon Civic Council Institutions and Civilian Association, 
Ruiz Massieu received a request by Gerardo Gomez Valdez, legal 
director for the Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce, for the 
PGR to unfreeze 200 million new pesos seized from three currency 
exchange houses (Monterrey, Colon, and Mercado de Cambios) in 
this city, which were charged with laundering money. This 
freeze not only affected the business owners, but over 200 
businessmen who had nothing to do with the legal procedure.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, 1 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Drug trafficking 
groups from the Mexican mountainous region and Asian criminal 
organizations are flooding the Ciudad Juarez-El Paso common 
border with heroin, which is prohibited in the United States. 
  Felipe Pando, a former chief of the State Judicial Federal 
Police, said that some types of drugs which were until recently 
unknown, such as white heroin, have emerged in the drug market. 
  He pointed out that during the sixties and the seventies 
this 
border became a "giant drug reservoir" for thousands of U.S. 
soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. 
  He recalled that the soldiers "came by the dozens. They 
crossed the international bridge every night looking for fun in 
the night spots. The drivers of the vehicles at those night 
spots were the contacts who drove them to the houses where 
heroin was sold." 
  The drug cartels that controlled the heroin that came from 
Asia and from the Mexican mountainous region were practically 
born in Ciudad Juarez. 
  Pando explained that "the city had a drug trafficking boom 
until the end of 1970 when the United States installed more 
military bases in other parts of the nation and Fort Bliss 
reduced its personnel. The U.S. soldiers left and the sale of 
drugs in Ciudad Juarez fell; it now concentrates on the export 
of drugs," he noted. 
  During more than one decade the city did not experience 
serious drug consumption problems until the beginning of 1990, 
when the so-called "reservoirs" and the drug traffickers emerged 
once again. 
  The DEA warned about the possibility that the South American 
cartels could form a possible alliance with the Asiatic 
organizations that use this area for the traffic of their 
illegal merchandise. 
  Michael Lappe, special agent in charge of the U.S. Customs 
Agency in El Paso, said that the alliance among international 
trafficking organizations "could be looking at the Juarez-El 
Paso area as a working place. Gangs from Nigeria are important 
players in heroin trade. They could have been testing the El 
Paso-Juarez area as a new contraband bridge to the United 
States," he stressed. 
  He noted that Colombian cartels "could be lending their 
marketing and contraband infrastructure to the heroin smugglers." 
  "This would implicate an alliance between the South American 
and Asian cartels, which is a matter of great concern," he noted. 
  Travis Kuykendall, DEA regional chief in south Texas, said 
that not only the Asian heroin is invading the area but also the 
heroin processed in the [Mexican] Western Sierra Madre. This is 
an area rich in opium seeds that has always been earmarked for 
the United States, although 3 percent remains in Ciudad Juarez 
and El Paso.

  [Text] Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, 12 May--Today, $70 million 
worth of cocaine "base" weighing 172 kg, with an additional 62 
kg of marijuana, sufficient to supply 200,000 persons, were 
seized. Their owner was arrested by personnel from the Attorney 
General's Office, according to a report submitted today by 
Javier Norona Guerrero, the Federal Judicial Police deputy 
commissioner here. 
  He added that, in the operation, led by Second Commander 
Arturo Pacheco Navarrete, in which agents patrolled the Rio 
Grande vicinity, Joel Delgado Bustamante, aged 49, was captured. 
  The latter was attempting to take the drugs to the 
settlement 
of San Isidro, in Juarez Valley, 15 km east of this border, he 
noted. 
  In a communique, the institution specifies that, along with 
the 90 packages of the alkaloid, another 40 packages containing 
marijuana were intercepted. 
  The accused was carrying the drugs in a 1987 Grand Marquis 
vehicle with Texas license plates GZ-65K. 
  In conclusion, Norona Guerrero explained that an 
investigation is being conducted to locate the owner of the 
drugs.

  [Excerpt] With the capture of 19 presumed drug traffickers, 
agents from the Attorney General's Office, in counternarcotics 
operations conducted in Baja California State, seized five tons 
and 639 kg of dried, packed marijuana with a black market value 
of $30 million, or 90 million new pesos. The large confiscation 
makes this state appear to be a "drug paradise." 
  During the action taken by members of the Federal Judicial 
Police and the National Institute To Combat Drugs, several 
collection centers for the grass that arrived from various parts 
of the country were dismantled. Included was a shipment brought 
in by charter from Mexico City, which those responsible were 
preparing to send to the United States. Also seized were seven 
vehicles outfitted to transport the marijuana. 
  Arturo Ochoa Palacios and Commander Rodolfo Garcia Gaxiola, 
the institution's representative and the Federal Judicial Police 
deputy commissioner in the state, respectively, gave a detailed 
account of the operations. 
  The largest seizure took place in the town of Tijuana, where 
federal agents confiscated a shipment of 2,966 kg of the grass, 
distributed in 369 rectangular packages concealed among 
perishable products. They were found in a warehouse of the 
Olivos Industrial Center, situated on Extension Road, lot 100, 
which was being guarded by Eleazar Ruiz Diaz and Ruben Alfonso 
Chavez Baez. 
  In another warehouse located at 10 Sancho Panza Street in 
the 
La Mesa precinct's Los Espanoles subdivision, of the same town, 
the public poisoners had hidden 1,401 kg and 900 grams. There, 
Noe Covian Sandoval, Alberto Maciel Benitez, and the brothers 
Cuauhtemoc and Cipriano Covian Garcia were arrested. They had 
unloaded the drugs from a tractor trailer truck of the Kenworth 
make, with a tanker, that had arrived from Guadalajara, Jalisco, 
driven by Jose Manuel Armendariz Torres. 
  Captured in the same town were Eusebio Rodriguez Quintero, 
Eugenio Hernandez Hernandez, and Luis Garcia Rodriguez, who had 
in their possession a marijuana shipment weighing 1,319 kg and 
400 grams, distributed in 455 packages. 
  The drugs were to be marketed at a machine shop located in 
the town's central section. Hence, a surveillance operation was 
mounted, until the aforementioned individuals were caught while 
setting the price. They had extracted a package of the drugs 
from a moving van, to show as a sample. 
  Later, with the information given by those in custody, 
another accomplice, Victor Hugo Garcia Elvira, who had been 
assigned to carry the drugs to Tijuana, was captured. [passage

  [Excerpt] Another severe blow was dealt to the drug traffic 
yesterday by the Attorney General's Office [PGR], when it seized 
five tons, 347 kg, and 800 grams of dried packed marijuana, 
worth over 90 million new pesos. In operations conducted in 
eight states, the Federal Judicial Police arrested 24 presumed 
drug dealers, also confiscating eight automotive vehicles used 
to transport drugs. 
  Among those arrested as persons presumed guilty of crimes 
against health were Urbano Barragan Ruiz, Javier Saldana 
Salazar, Lorena Salazar, Jose Israel Rueda Coria, Enrique 
Calderon Duarte, Jose Francisco Herrera, Jose Martin Ontiveros 
Galindo, Guadalupe Ontiveros Galindo, Jose Angel Limon Juarez, 
Jose Nieblas Chavez, Rafael Alcaraz Lopez, and Ignacio Torres 
Gil. 
  One of the largest seizures took place in Nuevo Leon, 
according to the report submitted by Roberto Soltero Acuna, the 
PGR's state representative, and Horacio Brun Acosta, deputy 
director of the Federal Judicial Police, on the confiscation of 
one ton and 512 kg of cannabis indica, which had arrived 
concealed in a tank truck. 
  Near km 145 of the Monterrey-Reynosa highway, Urbano 
Barragan 
Ruiz, driver of a 1986 Kenworth tractor-trailer truck with 
Federal Public Service license plates 256-AG9, was captured. The 
drugs were concealed in the "belly" of the tank, distributed in 
72 packages. 
  The vehicle was being guarded by Javier Saldana Salazar and 
Lorena Galvan, who were following the trailer in a Cheyenne 
pickup truck with Tamaulipas State registration VU-47085. 
  In their statements to the public ministry, the accused 
claimed that the drugs had been packed in Uruapan, Michoacan, 
and were bound for McAllen, Texas. 
  Another ton and 17 kg was seized in Sinaloa, specifically, 
in 
the municipality of Villa Union. Luis Antonio Cornejo, the PGR's 
state representative, reported that the drugs were being 
transported under a shipment of coconuts. At a checkpoint 
(Precos) set up on that site, the blue flatbed truck with plates 
350-AG3 was subjected to a search, and the illicit load was 
discovered. It had arrived from the municipality of Arteaga, 
Michoacan, with the town of Tijuana, Baja California, as its 
final destination. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Legislative Assembly yesterday approved the full 
Drug Law aimed at combating drug trafficking. This law provides 
judicial ruling for attention to drug addicts who, instead of 
prison terms, will be provided with rehabilitation. This will 
be an obligation of the Nicaraguan State. 
  The law, approved by a majority of votes, provides that 
those 
who are not authorized to cultivate or harvest seeds or plants 
from which psychotropic substances are obtained will be punished 
with a prison term ranging from three to 12 years and a 
3,000-50,000 cordoba fine. 
  The legislation provides sentences for those who stock drugs 
as well as for those who promote and encourage their 
consumption. The sentence could be increased up to double for 
those who induce minors. The deputies fixed sentences that 
range from 15-30 years and fines of up to 5 million cordobas for 
drug trafficking chiefs. 
  Deputy Doris Tijerino, president of the parliamentary drug 
committee, said that the law provides for lean sentences for 
those who, because of necessity, become victims of drugs while 
she reiterated the state's obligation to arrange for the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts. The deputy gave as an example 
(with regard to the fines that drug traffickers should pay) that 
the fines imposed by the police are serving to improve the 
salaries of the police officers who earn meager salaries. 
  The Assembly resolved that the fines collected by the state 
for drug-related crimes should be allocated to the 
rehabilitation of drug addicts and that these fines should be 
heavy when it is a matter of individuals who obtain economic 
benefits through the trafficking. 
  As of 1990, Nicaragua started to become a sort of 
"springboard" or "transfer" [preceding word in English] of 
cocaine from the south, by South American drug cartels. This 
situation has put on alert the government, the community, and 
the very legislators even though the police force--with the 
support of the DEA--has staged significant drug busts on 
Nicaraguan territory. 
  Nongovernmental organizations that give attention to persons 
addicted to drugs such as cocaine, crack, marijuana, and others, 
have indicated that in our country there are approximately 
300,000 persons who consume various types of drugs.
