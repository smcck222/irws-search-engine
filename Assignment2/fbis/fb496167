  [Text] Sarajevo, April 25 (AFP) -- Sarajevo hospitals 
Monday [25 April] took in a new load of wounded civilians with 
more tales of hellish conditions in Gorazde. 
  "Hitler was an angel compared with these guys," a woman 
escorting the evacuees, Ziba Hadzic, 62, said of the Serb forces 
who had bombarded her home town in eastern Bosnia since late 
March. 
  "He didn't go around setting hospitals and schools on fire." 
  The Kosevo hospital has set aside 500 beds, with 60 beds 
also 
available in the French City Hospital, Kosevo director Faruk 
Konjhodzic said. 
  Four flights by UN helicopters delivered 91 more refugees 
from Gorazde on Monday. 
  They were flown to a sports stadium which is being used as a 
landing strip. Most of the wounded were missing limbs. One 
woman had lost the whole of the lower half of her body. 
  Of 85 evacuees who arrived on Sunday, 36 had already been 
operated on. 
  Most were very badly wounded or exhausted through loss of 
blood, and others were in shock. 
  Some of the evacuees, having taken shelter in cellars, "have 
not seen daylight for a fortnight or more," Konjhodzic said. 
  All but five or six of the cases involved in operations were 
amputees. The great majority had shrapnel wounds. 
  Sixteen operating rooms were mobilised to deal with the 
influx, the hospital director said. 
  Genevieve Begkoyan, a doctor with the UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees, said that many of the wounded in Gorazde had 
simply died through lack of medical care. 
  She said it had become more difficult to collect and prepare 
evacuees for the flight because many of them had been taken back 
to their homes, scattered around the town. 
  UN sources said that a breakdown of the figures of killed 
and 
wounded by gender and age indicated that local Bosnian 
authorities had given priority to men of fighting age for 
treatment in Gorazde hospital. 
  A UNHCR doctor who stayed in the town, Mary McLoughlin, said 
there had "never been more that five percent of women and three 
percent of children" in the hospital.

  [Excerpts] After a two-day break, the radio bridge with 
Gorazde and Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the Executive Council of 
the Gorazde Region, and Dr. Alija Begovic, (?director) of the 
Gorazde hospital, has been established again. Here is a report 
by Senada Cumurovic: [passage omitted] 
  Ohranovic: The greatest problems that the citizens 
of Gorazde are now facing are the accommodation of the 
population that has been streaming from the occupied regions 
into the town and the problem of water. We are seeking the best 
solutions here and are insisting that the international 
organizations help solve the problem. The International Red 
Cross has tried to do something and has brought some equipment 
to supply at least the hospital with drinking water, that is, 
water for cleaning. However, the problem of the entire town has 
still not been solved. We are working together with the 
international organizations to solve the problem, but this is 
nevertheless going slowly. Gorazde's people are having a real 
problem with water and are using the murky waters of the River 
Drina. 
  Cumurovic: Thanks to the packages from the 
International Committee of the Red Cross and Medecins Sans 
Frontieres, the medical supplies to Gorazde and its hospitals 
have been improved, Dr. Alija Begovic said. However, he 
indicated a major health problem. 
  Begovic: It seems that we are facing an epidemic 
of infectious hepatitis. We already have several cases of it in 
different parts of the town. In such unhygienic conditions, this 
will be fatal if something is not done urgently. 
  Cumurovic: In three days, 265 wounded people have 
been evacuated from Gorazde but the need for further evacuation 
is still great. At this moment, UNPROFOR teams are visiting 
villages in the commune in order to transport people to Gorazde 
and then further on. Besides, in the town itself, 400 to 500 
wounded people are awaiting evacuation, Dr. Begovic said.

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta article: "The Army Tested Small Pox"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- Although only a month ago army officials 
kept quiet about the small pox virus ever having been studied in 
Czechoslovakia, the army admitted yesterday that military 
scholars worked with this dangerous virus in the 1960's and 
1970's. Moreover, according to the former employees of the 
Military Health Institute, the small pox virus has never been 
destroyed. 
  There was no small pox virus in the viral strain bank that 
the army liquidated last February; however, according to 
information available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's 
either. So far, none of the army or civilian officials we asked 
has explained what has actually happened to the small pox virus. 
  The director of the Central Military Health Institute, 
Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed 
between 1976 and 1978. "The small pox virus strain (variola 
maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It 
was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed. 
Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how 
it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the small pox virus 
was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year. 
It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's 
and 1970's," he said. He then emphasized that there is no viral 
strain, even less the small pox one, in his institute now. 
  A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to 
remain 
anonymous, and who used to work with the small pox viruses, 
asserted that, after the small pox research was concluded in the 
1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a 
special container. 
  In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic 
inoculation, small pox was completely suppressed, the General 
Commission for Elimination of Small Pox recommended that all 
remaining stock of small pox virus be either destroyed or 
transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and 
the USSR. "We have not respected the research recommendation by 
the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad 
intentions," the former staffer of the research laboratory 
admitted.

<F P=106> [Jaroslav Kmenta report: "A Prank With an Experimental </F>
Virus Could Have Caused a Smallpox Epidemic"] 
  [Text] Prague -- A smallpox virus, with which Czechoslovak 
military scientists were working in the 1970's, could have 
caused an unintentional epidemic in 1973. Vladimir Kotlar, a 
former senior employee at the research laboratory where the 
virus was kept, has claimed that -- despite a strict ban --this 
dangerous virus was used in diagnostic exercises in the military 
institute in Techonin in the Orlicke Mountains. 
  "This was an inappropriate prank by an officer," declared 
Kotlar. He added that the officer filled the test tubes whose 
contents the military scientists were to have ascertained in the 
exercise with the smallpox virus. "Doctors immediately 
vaccinated all of the approximately 20 people who came into 
contact with the virus and ensured that the smallpox was not 
passed on," he said. 
  A Defense Ministry inspection team has now begun an 
investigation into what happened to the smallpox virus specimen 
after the military scientists had stopped working with it. This 
was confirmed by an army source who also said that the 
inspection team has meanwhile come to the conclusion that this 
dangerous virus was undoubtedly destroyed in 1975.

<F P=106> ["(km)"-signed report: "An Order Was Issued To Destroy the </F>
Smallpox Virus; However, It Was Probably Never Carried Out"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Despite the fact that Vladimir Kotlar, 
the former senior employee at the research laboratory where the 
smallpox virus was tested in the 1970's, claims that he issued 
instructions that it be destroyed, another employee at the same 
institute has cast doubts on its destruction. According to this 
source, who does not wish to be named because he fears a 
negative reaction from the public, the virus was not destroyed 
out of the sheer indolence of the staff involved in the 
research. "The scientific recommendation from the World Health 
Organization that supplies of the smallpox virus be destroyed 
were ignored by us out of laziness, not out of any evil 
intentions," he declared. 
  The ministerial commission that is now looking into the fate 
of the dangerous virus has -- to date -- only Kotlar's statement 
at its disposal. He has admitted that, although he ordered the 
virus's destruction, he was not personally present for it. 
Moreover, according to the findings so far, there are no 
records of this. 
  Meanwhile, the Defense Ministry rejects the possibility that 
the smallpox virus was unknowingly preserved in the Czech 
Republic until this February, that is, until the entire bank of 
viral strains was completely destroyed. 
  According to some employees from the military institute, a 
test tube with this virus could -- of course -- have been 
deposited along with the other viruses in a special container 
with liquid nitrogen and did not have to be registered in the 
official record of the bank of viral strains. 
  Doctors recorded the last case of smallpox in Czechoslovakia 
in 1976 when a Czechoslovak Airlines pilot was diagnosed as 
having the disease after he returned from Bombay, India. The 
Czechoslovak Health Service stopped inoculating the population 
against smallpox in 1980 after the World Health Organization had 
ascertained that mankind was no longer at risk from a smallpox 
epidemic.

<F P=106> ["uj"-signed report: "The Nourishment of Children in </F>
Socially Weak Families Is Very Poor"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Since the first wave of food price 
increases in 1991, in the wake of the liberalization of prices, 
milk consumption in Slovakia has declined 12.7 percent. 
  According to data of the Research Institute of Nutrition 
(VUV), which monitored in this period the state of nourishment 
of the population in economically high-risk regions [ekonomicky 
rizikove regiony] (Orava, Kysuce), the daily consumption of milk 
should be at least half a liter. The consumption of dairy 
products has declined here 17.3 percent, consumption of cheese 
13.3 percent, and consumption of fish more than 20 percent. The 
consumption of fruit has declined 19 percent in these regions 
and vegetable consumption as much as 22.1 percent. According to 
A. Bederova, MD, head of the Epidemiology Department, 
surprisingly negative findings have been ascertained with regard 
to children and youth from poorer regions. The deteriorated 
spectrum of fat substances in blood is alarming. The high level 
of cholesterol in the blood of school-age children and 
adolescents has gone up from 15-17 percent to 22-29 percent. The 
number of obese children has gone up by 2 to 6 percent. Almost 
one in three adolescents had a reduced level of selen (an 
important protective substance against tumorous diseases). The 
intake of calcium has declined 51 percent and intake of vitamin 
C 61 percent.

  [Text] Geneva, April 19 (AFP) -- The rump Yugoslavia 
Tuesday [19 April] said UN sanctions against it had caused the 
deaths of 30,000 people, including 15,000 children. 
  Yugoslav deputy health minister Svetlana Arsenic told the UN 
children's committee here that despite provisions to allow 
medical equipment into Yugoslavia, the sanctions had denied 
vital medical equipment to thousands of ordinary people. 
  The embargo on trade with Serbia and Montenegro was imposed 
by the United Nations in May 1992 to punish Belgrade for 
supporting Serb aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Children have been particularly hard hit by the scarcity of 
medical equipment and drugs and 15,000 have died as a result, 
the Yugoslav minister said. 
  If the UN agrees to an exception for medical equipment, 
"even 
the smallest imports" are subject to complicated bureaucratic 
procedures at the UN sanctions committee in New York, Arsenic 
said. 
  "The examination of a large number of requests is constantly 
delayed and put back," she said. 
  Yugoslavia's ambassador to Geneva, Vladimir Pavicevic, said 
that because of the impact of the sanctions, Belgrade can no 
longer apply the UN convention on children's rights. 
  Sanctions against Yugoslavia have caused a sharp fall in 
medical cover available with some of the most vulnerable being 
the 3.2 million children in the region, 200,000 of whom are war 
refugees "of all nationalities", Arsenic added. 
  In several areas of Yugoslavia, the death rate has risen 
above the birth rate, she added, suggesting that this 
jeopardised "the very survival of the Yugoslav people."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Over 221 Kosovars Died of Contagious </F>
Epidemics Last Year" -- issued by the Democratic League of 
Kosovo"] 
  [Text] During the last year, the population of Kosova 
suffered from 33 contagious epidemics, thus leaving behind the 
death toll of 221. Compared to the data from the previous year 
(1992), the number of epidemics has doubled, today's BUJKU 
reports. 
  According to the evidence issued by the Kosovo Epidemiologic 
and Hygienic Institution, the most frequent epidemics that have 
been prevailing among the population were various types of 
diarrhea, tuberculosis, scabies, scarlet fever, enteric typhus, 
etc. 
  Children and newborns were those who were mostly hit by the 
diarrhea. Some 211 children out of 5,636 who suffered diarrhea 
died in 1993. Some [words indistinct] tuberculosis, 18 of food 
intoxication, 5 children died of measles, etc. There were over 
3,256 registered cases of scabies, mainly among the school 
children, BUJKU says. 
  The lack of due vaccination and medicines, poverty and 
malnutrition, as well as the lack of medical institutions and 
personnel have resulted in such an alarming health care and 
epidemiologic situation in Kosova. 
  Following the Serbian crack-down on Kosova in 1989, the vast 
majority of Albanian doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff 
were fired on ethnic grounds. A great number of medical centers 
and clinics in many centers of Kosova have been either closed 
down or are run by Serbs only. 
  Albanian workers who were forcefully dismissed (over 100,000 
Albanians were dismissed in 1990 only), as well as their 
children were subsequently denied insurance and health care 
protection.

<H5>  Nicaragua </H5>
  AIDS -- The health minister of Nicaragua announced on 13 May 
that in Nicaragua there have been 133 cases of AIDS, including

  AIDS -- Eleven persons have died in Colon from AIDS during 
the first 14 weeks of 1994. The people want to know if the 
increase in the number of persons with this disease has anything 
to do with the temporary presence of women from the Dominican 
Republic and Colombia, and that of military personnel from 
countries where AIDS is at epidemic proportions. (Panama City EL 
SIGLO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 5) 
  AIDS -- Regional health director Aurelio Ranger has reported 
to LA PRENSA that two AIDS cases have been detected in Penonome, 
Cocle Province. Rangel reports that in all of 1993 there was 
only one AIDS case in the province. (Panama City LA PRENSA in

  [Text] Brazilian Health Minister Henrique Santillo has 
announced in Rio de Janeiro that he is holding talks with Cuba 
in order to import the meningococcal meningitis vaccine, the 
only of its kind in the world. The objective of his ministry is 
to conduct a vaccination campaign in Rio de Janeiro, where, even 
though there is no epidemic, meningitis has already taken the 
lives of 10 infants this year alone. Santillo also stated that 
the vaccination will be conducted in Brazil as soon as possible. 
  Santillo went on to say that there are cases of 
meningococcal 
meningitis in many nations. He also acknowledged the 
effectiveness of the Cuban-made medicine to counter this illness.

<F P=106> ["First Thing" program health segment by Dr. Miguel Barroso </F>
Molina -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] 
  Barroso: Good morning, listeners. Today we are 
going to talk about the very important, overall environmental 
cleanup plan. My guest today is Dr. (Adelaida Ibaz Monet), a 
specialist in hygiene and epidemiology from Havana Province, 
whom I welcome to this program. 
  (Ibaz]: Thank you very much, Dr. Barroso. 
  Barroso: Adelaida, what was the origin of this 
Overall Environmental Cleanup Plan [Plan Integral de 
Higienizacion Ambiental]? And let's call it PIHA, to give it an 
acronym. 
  (Ibaz]: Since 1990, because of the restrictions of 
the special period, there has been a gradual deterioration of 
the hygiene and health conditions in Havana, and of course in 
the province as well. This situation has brought with it a whole 
series of difficulties in supplying water and in chlorinating 
the water supply. There are also difficulties in treating and 
disposing of liquid wastes, as well as in collecting, 
transporting, and disposing of solid wastes. 
  Along with this has come an increase in the incidence of 
infestations of different kinds, such as mosquitoes, flies, 
cockroaches, and rodents. All this brings with it a 
deterioration in hygiene and health habits, which in turn brings 
significant changes in the incidence and mortality rates of 
contagious diseases. 
  Barroso: Doctor, what are the contagious diseases 
that most increase in such a situation? 
  (Ibaz]: Among them are acute diarrheas, different 
types of hepatitis, leptospirosis, etc. 
  Barroso: And tell me: Is not cholera among these 
contagious diseases? What measures are being taken against 
cholera here in Cuba? Because we know that there is a cholera 
epidemic, that cholera is practically pandemic, in Latin America 
right now. 
  (Ibaz]: As you have rightly said, the moment this 
cholera pandemic hit America, our country took pertinent 
measures, and there is an overall plan, in this connection. Our 
country is not exempt from risk, of course, and such a thing 
would do us serious damage, not just to health but also from the 
economic point of view. [passage omitted] 
  Barroso: There is a disease you mentioned that is 
on the rise right now: leptospirosis. We know that leptospirosis 
is a disease whose symptoms resemble many other illnesses, 
because it can cause fevers. Sometimes people even have renal 
problems; we know of patients who have displayed hematuria and 
turned out to have leptospirosis. The disease can be benign but 
it can also be fatal. What strategy are you using to prevent 
this increase in leptospirosis? [sentence as heard] Which we 
also know to be a disease caused by animals, right? I mean, it 
is a zoonosis. 
  (Ibaz]: That is correct. Leptospirosis is a 
zoonosis that is transmitted not just by dogs, as is commonly 
believed. There are other animals that can transmit the 
leptospira. The population very frequently raises pigs and other 
domestic animals that can also transmit the leptospira. 
  In Havana Province, in particular, as one of the first steps 
prior to discussing this plan for cleaning up the environment 
and after the surveying that has been done in the different 
municipalities, we have begun implementing a plan to eliminate 
rats. This plan basically entails diminishing the number of 
rodents in the province and targets certain priority centers 
such as cane camps, vacation time agricultural labor sites, food 
program camps, schools and health establishments, and centers 
where food is processed and sold. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The authorities of the Ministry of Public Health 
have denied that there is an epidemic of classic dengue fever 
affecting 6,000 persons in the Canton of Macara, Loja Province, 
although the figures reported by the authorities in Quito, 
Macara, and Loja continue to contradict each other. 
  Reports issued in the last few days by Ramon Aguirre, 
director of health of the Province of Loja, state that in the 
Canton of Macara 6,000 cases of classic dengue fever had been 
identified in the last few weeks. This amounts to 20 percent of 
the total population. As a result he even asked for the 
declaration of a health emergency in the Canton of Macara. 
  This same information was confirmed on the following day by 
Dr. Dalton Arevalo, the director of the Hospital of Macara, and 
by Dr. Jose Prado. Both of them pointed out that the situation 
was not a cause for particular alarm, after comparing the number 
of sick persons and the total number of persons living in the 
canton. 
  Two days after the report by the director of health of the 
Canton of Loja was issued the Ministry of Health explained that 
a survey of the population had been carried out to determine how 
many persons had ever suffered from dengue fever in their whole 
lives. The result of the survey was that 20 percent of the 
population of the canton had suffered from dengue fever at one 
time or another. The Canton of Macara has a population of 30,000 
people. 
  In the entire Province of Loja 39 cases of classic dengue 
fever were reported during the first two months of 1994. It is 
expected that data for the month of March will show that the 
total figure does not exceed 100 cases, the authorities said, as 
they confirmed that this was not an epidemic in any way. 
  For his part Ricardo Canizares, the regional chief of 
epidemiology, said in Guayaquil that, according to data provided 
by the Leopoldo Izquieta Perez Institute of Health, no more than 
three cases of classic dengue fever had been positively 
confirmed in the Canton of Macara. An additional 46 cases were 
reported but not confirmed. Meanwhile, when Nicolas Jara, the 
undersecretary of health, was asked about the number of cases of 
dengue fever recorded in the Canton of Macara, he stated that he 
did not know the figure. However, he ordered that the 
information be collected. It was reported that in January and 
February of 1994 39 cases were confirmed in all of the Province 
of Loja, and it is expected that there will be no more than 100 
cases confirmed in March. 
  Nevertheless, he recognized that the increase in the number 
of cases of dengue fever in the Province of Loja reflected the 
fact that no health precautions are being taken in Peruvian 
border towns.

  [Text] Six persons are under medical observation in Quito, 
with symptoms which indicate diphtheria, Nicolas Jara, acting 
minister of health, reported. 
  If it is confirmed that they are cases of diphtheria, up to 
this point there reportedly are 27 persons suffering from the 
disease. Last week 21 cases had already been confirmed. 
  The Ministry of Health has confirmed the death of two 
persons 
from diphtheria. Those deaths were due to carelessness by the 
persons concerned, who did not seek medical attention in a 
timely way. 
  Minister of Health Jara said that he does not have enough 
vaccine on hand to make it possible to begin a mass inoculation 
campaign for all residents of Quito. Nevertheless, he stated 
that the Izquieta Perez Institute has provided 50,000 doses of 
vaccine and that another 50,000 doses will be made available in 
the next few days. Furthermore, next week the Pan American 
Health Organization will provide 500,000 doses of the vaccine. 
  Jara said that the Ministry of Health is making sure that 
people living near a person suffering from diphtheria receive 
the necessary inoculations to prevent an epidemic from 
developing. 
  He warned people who choose to be inoculated by private 
medical personnel to go to well-known medical centers because, 
if they do not do so, they may be swindled. It is known that in 
some cases inoculations for infants are being given to adults, a 
situation which may be dangerous. 
<H5>  Case Reported in Guayaquil </H5>
  Guayaquil--A case of diphtheria in this city is being 
studied 
carefully. This was announced on 18 March by Ricardo Canizares, 
the regional chief of epidemiology. 
  At present the case is being studied at the Leopoldo 
Izquieta 
Perez Institute to ensure that a correct diagnosis is made.

  [Excerpt] Guayaquil--Between 1992 and 1993 the number of 
cases of malaria in Ecuador increased by 6,198, according to 
official data made available to HOY by the National Service for 
the Eradication of Malaria [SNEM]. 
  According to the data, there were 46,711 cases of malaria 
throughout Ecuador at the end of 1993. This total is higher than 
that for 1992, when 40,513 cases were identified. This proves 
that this illness has not declined in Ecuador but, on the 
contrary, has increased dangerously, despite the continuing 
spraying campaigns carried out by the SNEM. 
  A joint meeting was held between officials of the 
Subsecretariat of Health of the Coastal Area and those of the 
SNEM and of the provincial directorates which come under the 
SNEM. 
  According to official figures, of the 46,711 cases of 
malaria 
reported in 1993 some 15,233 were of the "falciparum" variety 
(cerebral malaria which can cause death) and 31,478 cases of the 
"vivax" variety (the usual type of malaria). 
<H5>  Province of Guayas </H5>
  Regarding the areas most affected in the Province of Guayas, 
in 1992 there were 1,677 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 2,710 
cases of "vivax" malaria. On the other hand, in 1991 there were 
3,903 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 4,701 cases of "vivax" 
malaria. In 1993 there were 3,903 cases of "falciparum" malaria 
and 4,701 cases of "vivax" malaria. 
<H5>  Province of Manabi </H5>
  In the Province of Manabi 6,583 cases of "falciparum" 
malaria 
and 3,054 cases of "vivax" malaria were confirmed in 1992. In 
1993 there was a total of 7,284 cases of "falciparum" malaria 
and 2,897 cases of "vivax" malaria. 
<H5>  Province of Esmeraldas </H5>
  In the Province of Esmeraldas there were 3,768 cases of 
"falciparum" malaria and 7,069 cases of "vivax" malaria in 1992, 
while there were 5,665 cases of "falciparum" malaria and 6,772 
cases of "vivax" malaria in 1993. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Stopping the vaccination, banning the handling 
of the virus, a possible increase in the Indemnification Fund 
from 0.21 to 1 percent, and the slaughtering of animals in case 
the disease is reintroduced are some of the direct consequences 
of the beginning of the second stage of the plan to eradicate 
foot-and-mouth disease, which is to be implemented on 16 June. 
  Uruguay, which is at present considered free from 
foot-and-mouth disease, with vaccination, enters this new stage 
amid pressures and criticism from several sectors involved, but 
with the firm decision of producers, who together with 
ministerial authorities agreed that 15 June will be the last day 
for vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease in our territory. 
  There is no going back now. Agriculture and Fishing Minister 
Pedro Saravia will communicate this significant decision at the 
International Office of Epizootics (OIE) annual assembly, which 
is to be held in Paris on 16 May. [passage omitted] 
  Trade benefits undoubtedly played a central role in making 
such an important decision. It should be remembered that the 
government has announced that once the country enters the 
disease-free circuit, it will sell 20,000 tonnes of beef to the 
United States as part of a quota upon which no tariffs are 
levied. 
[passage omitted] 
  Uruguay has been free of foot-and-mouth disease for 46 
months. No focal points have been reported since January 1991, 
and authorities have reported that no viral activity has been 
spotted within 300 km of our border. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bhopal, Feb. 27 (PTI [Press Trust of India]): There 
are a total of 707 patients who are confirmed to be suffering 
from the dreaded AIDS in the country, according to Dr. Lev N. 
Khodakevich of the World Health Organisation, who is working as 
a medical officer for the global programme on AIDS in India. 
  Dr. Khodakevich, who was here recently to inaugurate a 
five-day national project for training doctors in tackling AIDS, 
said the number of unreported AIDS cases in the country could be 
anything between 10,000 and 20,000. 
  Bombay and Manipur were the most affected areas as far as 
AIDS was concerned, he said. One per cent of pregnant women in 
these two places were suffering from the HIV infection. 
  Dr. Khodakevich said Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Daman 
and 
Diu were the country's only places from where not a single AIDS 
case had been reported but pointed out that this could be due to 
lack of any proper reporting system for the disease. AIDS had 
first entered the country in 1986. The largest number of AIDS 
patients were found in the world in Africa, followed by Asia, 
South America, North America and Europe.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcus Dam: "Living in the Times of Malaria"] </F>
  [Text] The scourge seems to have finally buzzed its way 
into Calcutta and settled here for good. 
  Earlier this week a report reaching the State's Health 
Directorate stated that of the 26 cases of malaria detected in a 
private laboratory in south Calcutta nine were of the malignant, 
lethal variety known as Plasmodium falciparum, which 
had been confined for long to the districts of North Bengal. But 
this was just a tip of the iceberg in a city where the disease 
seems to have assumed endemic proportions. 
  The two-fold increase in the incidence of the disease has 
been causing concern to the authorities over the last two years. 
In the past year 1,545 cases were reported from Calcutta, 
against 728 attacks the preceding year. Any sign of a reversal 
in trends seems absent. 
  The danger limits set by the World Health Organization have 
been left behind, baffling experts who are alarmed over the rise 
in the annual parasitic index which has exceeded 5,000, 
confirming fears that the city has become "epidemiologically 
dangerous". 
  A major reason for the increase in malignant malaria cases 
(popularly referred to as cerebral malaria), which accounts for 
nearly eight per cent of all reported malarial attacks, is the 
victim's growing immunity to drugs as well as the vector's 
resistance to insecticides, says Dr. Subodh Dey, 
Mayor-in-Council, Health. 
  He admits that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation's fogging 
machines (seven in all) "have of late not been utilized 
optimally because of the hazards their use could cause to the 
environment". 
  The vector -- Anophiles stephensi -- seems to have 
turned resistant to organo-phosphorous compounds like batex, 
used in spraying. Moreover, with more and more drains being 
covered, large stretches are virtually inaccessible to spraying. 
  There is, however, another reason why not all zones where 
anti-vector measures are required can be reached. Staff shortage 
is a problem. In all 88 vacancies in the Corporation's Vector 
Control Department have yet to be filled in", Dr. Dey adds. 
  Largely responsible for the patient's resistance to drugs is 
the growing tendency among medical practitioners to ignore 
WHO-recommended schedules where blood samples are expected to be 
checked twice (seven and 21 days) following treatment, says Dr. 
A.K. Mukhopadhyay, Assistant Director, Union Ministry of Health 
and Family Planning. 
  There are, however, other reasons which could explain why 
the 
vector has suddenly found Calcutta so congenial, he feels. 
According to him these are: 

  -  Rapid urbanization and the construction boom which comes 
in its wake, and 
  -  The substantial migrant population hailing from endemic zones 
in the Chhotanagpur belt. 

  Dr. Mukhopadhyay believes that a bulk of the malignant 
malarial cases, which are reported from different malaria 
clinics in the city, come from the more "posh areas" rather than 
the suburbs. "For it is here, contrary to popular notion, that 
the vector finds abundant breeding place," he adds. These places 
are possibly: 

  -  the huge receptacles of water found lying about a 
construction site; 
  -  domestic water reservoirs attached to nearly every house; 
  -  the stored water for air coolers and air conditioners; and, 
  -  even the underground Metro tunnel, Dr. Mukhopadhyay suggests. 

  "Even a flower vase, where the water may have remained 
unchanged for about a week, is a more congenial breeding place 
than the highly polluted Keshtopur canal", he says. 
  Migrant workers from areas like south Bihar and Sundergarh 
in 
Orissa are also believed to "act as carriers of the parasite, 
though they themselves may be merely asymptomatic cases", 
according to his studies. 
  Parts of Chhotanagpur have a startling annual parasitic 
index 
-- above 20 per thousand people, according to estimates reaching 
the regional office of the Ministry's Health and Family Planning 
Department at Patna. 
  The authorities have been offered a proposal to introduce 
legal provisions to make it mandatory on the part of private 
laboratories to enlist malaria cases without which the gravity 
of the situation cannot be assessed, says Dr. B.K. Khastigir, 
zonal officer, Presidency division, in the State's Health 
Directorate. 
  "Anti-vector operations can only be carried out in select 
sites, given the resource constraints. But without any 
information on the occurance of the disease one does not know 
where to start", he adds.

  [Text] Even as another elephant in the North Bengal forests 
is suspected to have fallen prey to the dreaded disease, 
anthrax, veterinary doctors and wildlife officials are divided 
over the cause of the recent deaths. 
  The carcass of an elephant was found in south Raidak on 
Friday. Wildlife officials suspect it to be the fifth victim of 
the disease. 
  The differences surfaced with the district veterinary 
doctors 
maintaining that no "Bacillus anthraxcis" could be 
traced in the blood of the last three victims. 
  The wildlife officials were however, more than certain that 
external symptoms showed evidence of the pachyderms being 
affected with anthrax. Not satisfied with the findings of the 
district veterinary doctors, they arranged to send blood samples 
to Calcutta for re-examination. 
  The veterinary doctors' attempt to rule out an anthrax 
attack 
was not without reason. With signs of the disease still 
spreading and taking its toll, there was an increasing 
possibility of the doctors being criticized for having failed to 
give advance warning. 
  The wildlife officials said that had there been the 
slightest 
indication of the disease, immunization programmes could have 
been taken up in right earnest and the casualties could be 
restricted. Even last year, the Forest Department undertook 
immunization programmes.

<F P=106> [Article by Galina Yudkevich under the "Draft Law" rubric: </F>
"What Guarantees Will People Infected With HIV Have" -- from the 
"Retsept" section] 
  [Text] First, a few figures cited by Vadim Pokrovskiy, 
head of the Russian Anti-AIDS Center, at a meeting of the [State 
Duma] Health Care Committee, where the draft law "On Preventing 
the Spread of HIV" was examined. 
  As of 1 April there were 740 Russian citizens (including 282 
children) and 450 foreigners in Russia registered as being 
infected with HIV. But when you consider that the period 
between infection and the development of the outward signs of 
the disease averages seven-eight years and the special survey in 
1993 covered 25 million Russians, then registered cases 
constitute only 15-20 percent of the true number of Russian 
Federation citizens infected with HIV. Some 110 of those 
infected have died. In terms of the number of people infected 
or sick, the situation in Russia today corresponds to the 
situation in the United States in the early eighties. There are 
fears that in 10 years' time we could reach or even exceed the 
current level of incidence of the disease in the United States 
(1.5-2 million people infected). 
  As is known, a law "On AIDS Prevention" was adopted in the 
Soviet Union back in 1990. Why do we need a new legislative act? 
  The main reason is that the situation is rapidly changing 
for 
the worse. For example, the problem of the increase in the 
number of children infected as a result of medical negligence 
(remember the recent Elista affair) has become topical only of 
late, and only in our country. 
  There is a subjective reason too: The previous law (which is 
still in force) contains substantial shortcomings. The very 
term "the disease AIDS" is inaccurate: On the one hand, the 
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is the final stage of the 
disease that begins with HIV infection; on the other hand, AIDS 
can be caused by other factors as well -- exposure to radiation, 
for example. 
  The 1990 law contains articles that are questionable from 
the 
viewpoint of the observance of human rights. Practice has shown 
in recent years that the provision concerning the citizen's duty 
to undergo a medical examination "if there are sufficient 
grounds for supposing that the person is infected with HIV" has 
led not only to compulsory examination ("sufficient grounds" has 
sometimes been interpreted very freely by physicians), but to 
considerable economic losses (total expenditure on "examination" 
in 1993 constituted approximately 50 billion rubles). 
  One other obvious defect of the law was the lack of clarity 
over the position of infected foreigners. According to the 
statistics, HIV infection was found to be 100 times more common 
in foreigners living in Russia than in Russian Federation 
citizens, although the requisite legal mechanism for their 
deportation does not exist. 
  The main purpose of the new draft law is to legislatively 
confirm the state's duties in relation to the prevention of HIV 
infection and the treatment of and provision of social 
assistance for the victims. Antidiscrimination measures for 
people infected with HIV and their families and social 
guarantees for medical staff at risk of infection also need to 
be enshrined in legislation. There must also be tougher 
sanctions against medical staff responsible for infection. 
  According to the draft law, "a medical examination to 
ascertain HIV infection is carried out if a person voluntarily 
requests it or with his consent." This is the only wording that 
corresponds to generally acknowledged international law 
standards today. Only foreigners, blood donors, and some 
categories of professionals -- surgeons, for example -- are 
liable to compulsory examination. If infection is establishad, 
the state has the right to deport foreigners, while Russian 
citizens are "subject to monitoring at a special clinic and to 
treatment only with their consent." They are entitled to all 
types of free medical assistance in outpatient clinics and 
hospitals, including free return travel to the place of 
treatment. 
  A large section of the draft law is devoted to social 
protection for people infected with HIV and for their families. 
In particular, they are not allowed to be dismissed from work 
or turned away from work or from medical, educational or 
children's institutions. There are special articles stipulating 
the rights of parents with infected children (being able to stay 
with them in hospitals, retaining their continuous service 
record with the payment of benefits in the event of their 
leaving work to look after a child, top-priority provision of 
separate housing); social protection for people in medical and 
other professions at risk of infection. 
  Finally, a special article in the draft specifies the duties 
of the state in relation to prevention of the disease, in 
particular making medical examination, including anonymous 
examination, accessible to all. 
  According to the members and experts of the State Duma 
Committee on Health Care, the proposed draft law needs to be 
fine-tuned: For example, social guarantees for people infected 
with HIV through the fault of medical staff and sanctions 
against the latter need to be specified. 
  In May the draft law "On Preventing the Spread of HIV in the 
Russian Federation," finalized taking into account all the 
observations, will be submitted for discussion by the State Duma.

  [Text] At a Thursday session the Russian cabinet approved 
on the whole a draft federal program for protecting the 
territory of the Russian Federation against the appearance and 
spread of dangerous infectious diseases of human beings, animals 
and plants as well as toxic substances. The program covers a 
period between 1994 and 1997. 
  The head of the State Sanitation Control Agency Yevgeniy 
Belyayev, who submitted the document, said that the necessity 
for the comprehensive program is prompted by the growing flow of 
migrants to Russia, the worsening of the epidemiological 
situation in CIS and certain foreign countries as well as a 
sharp increase in imports of poor-quality, harmful goods. 
  Belyayev said that in 1993 his agency had to ban the sales 
of 
1000 big batches of imported food. A total of 18.2 percent of 
imported alcoholic drinks do not meet medical standards. The 
same applies to 7.3 percent of canned food. 
  The official said that 11 cases of cholera were registered 
in 
Russia in 1993, all of foreign origin. In each case three 
million rubles were spent to prevent an epidemic. 
  The draft program provides for the formation of a network of 
sanitary control bodies on the borders, sea and air ports and 
railway stations. 
  At the federal level 77 checkpoints should be constructed or 
modernized in centers for forced migrants, 10 quarantine posts 
at railway stations, nine veterinary laboratories, 25 plant 
laboratories and 143 plant quarantine posts on borders. 
According to Finance Ministry estimates, in 1994 this will 
require 26 billion rubles of spending.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Nadezhdin "Health Care on Short Rations, </F>
or Revoke the Bank's License"] 
  [Text] For Moscow health-care establishments, the new year 
came with an unpleasant surprise -- no money. Blood banks were 
forced to turn away donors because there was no money to pay 
them. And this at a time when city medical facilities are 
chronically short of donor blood. In 1992, there were 360,000 
registered blood donors; in 1993, there were only 60,000. 
  Why is there no money? Perhaps the government stopped 
funding 
municipal health-care services. On the contrary, Moscow's city 
government made sure well ahead of time that medical 
establishments had enough money to provide a normal level of 
services. As early as last December, the city treasury 
authorized the Commercial People's Bank, where Moscow keeps its 
accounts, to transfer 17 billion rubles for municipal 
health-care needs to the checking account of Moscow's Main 
Medical Authority. However, MMMA received only one-tenth that 
amount. 
  "Bank officials have not provided a satisfactory 
explanation," says Anatoliy Solovyev, head of MMMA. "I consider 
the bank's actions criminal. The funds withheld were not going 
to support salaries and overhead, but to fund vital medical 
services. Many of our patients' lives were jeopardized. The bank 
should have its license pulled for doing this."

Workers"] 
  [Text] Two new health-care facilities have opened. A modern 
seven-story building was constructed for Municipal Polyclinic 
129, which serves residents of the former Bauman district. It is 
equipped with the latest in medical technology, including 
ultrasound diagnostic and hydrotherapy equipment and a wonderful 
stomatological and dental clinic. Since the old building still 
houses a trauma center, a "steering" committee, and a number of 
other amenities, Polyclinic 129 can be characterized as a modern 
medical facility. 
  Muscovites received another gift in the form of a modern 
Family Planning Center that has individual natal rooms as well 
as suites where happy mothers can stay with their newborns. It 
also boasts a natal unit with the latest word in intensive-care 
equipment. No other natal center in Moscow has one. 
  The Family Planning Center was built in just a year by the 
Turkish company Enka, which donated its services.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article entitled "You Can't Be a Shaman </F>
Without a License" under the "Specialist's Commentary" rubric] 
  [Text] The law is simple and straightforward. As of January 
1, 1994, medical establishments in Moscow can practice only if 
they are licensed by the city. Medical offices, businesses, or 
practitioners who choose to work without a license face serious 
consequences, including penalities imposed by tax authorities. 
  V. I. Shastin, head of the licensing department for the Main 
Medical Authority in Moscow, and Ye. V. Polivoda, a top official 
in the same office, told this paper that the list of those who 
have successfully applied for and obtained licenses numbers 795 
offices, businesses, and private practitioners. 
  Although most of the nation's public health-care system is 
in 
the hands of licensed professionals, this cannot be said about 
private medical practice. Only three individuals have been 
officially authorized to practice medicine. They are Pastor 
Chzhu Ok, an acupuncturist from the Republic of Korea, M. A. 
Chkhikvadze, and D. M. Filler, all of whom are in private 
practice. No more than 30 partnerships and cooperatives have 
obtained licenses, although another 107 have applied for them. 
There are nearly 2,000 medical establishments in private 
practice. 
  Shamans, psychics, and folk healers must also obtain 
licenses 
that state the types of medical services they offer. None of the 
practioners listed on the "hot line" have done so. 
  Incidentally, practioners of traditional or folk medicine 
must undergo a different type of licensing and be regulated by a 
special subcommission made up of those of their peers and 
colleagues with a medical background. Any traditional or folk 
healer wishing to treat people must have a medical diploma. 
  Today, inasmuch as the process of issuing licenses is being 
bogged down by paperwork, the department responsible for 
licensing is, in exceptional cases, issuing temporary 
authorizations to practice medicine. Temporary licenses are good 
for three months, whereas regular licenses are good for one year. 
  Anyone seeking medical help should be sure that the person 
or 
establishment they consult is properly licensed. This will help 
to avoid problems.

  [Text] The incidence of infectious diseases continues to 
increase in Moscow. Especially alarming is the number of cases 
of diphtheria (a 3.2-fold increase since 1992), measles (up 
2.8-fold over the last year), and Flexner's dysentery (a 
1.7-fold increase). There has also been a 1.6-fold increase in 
the number of people who have contracted whooping cough. The 
number of people infected with the herpes virus has increased 
34.92%, and there has been a 24% rise in the 
number of 
tuberculosis patients. The total number of cases involving acute 
intestinal illnesses has dropped 10%, but clinical 
physicians 
attribute this to the fact that fewer people are seeking medical 
help.

  [Text] Fourteen of the capitol's 47 ambulance substations 
are out on strike, paralyzing emergency medical services and 
leaving corpses lying in the streets. 
  In an interview with ITAR--TASS, Leon Akopov, chairman of 
the 
council that represents Moscow's emergency medical technicians, 
stated that "the strike committee is not going to back down on 
its demands". He was alluding to the Main Medical Authority's 
plans to reorganize ambulance services and place them under a 
different authority. 
  As before, ambulance service management and the Main Medical 
Authority are not acknowledging the striker's demands and are 
preparing to take disciplinary action. 
  According to a report issued by the council, four of the 
striking sub-stations sent a letter today to the mayor of 
Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, demanding that the reorganization process 
be stopped and that the mayor personally assume supervision of 
ambulance services.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Liliya Luznetsova] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, 5 May -- The extremely poor state of the 
nation's health is indicated by the infant mortality level. 
Over the last three years a constant increase in the number of 
children not surviving their first year of life has been 
observed in Russia. 
  Whereas in 1990 an average of 17.4 babies per 1,000 births 
were dying, the figure became 17.8 in 1992, 18 in 1993, and 19 a 
year later. 
  These figures from the Russian Federation's national report 
to the eighth world conference on the situation of women, which 
is to be held in Beijing next year, are capable of shocking 
medical specialists throughout the world -- which is not 
surprising since in the advanced countries the figure for baby 
mortality in recent years has not only not increased, but has 
indeed decreased and stabilized at a level of five to eight 
deaths of children in their first year per 1,000 births. 
  According to statistics there has been a deterioration too 
in 
the health of babies. Whereas three years ago one in seven 
babies were born ill or became ill, the figure rose in the 
following year to one in six, and a year later it was one in 
five. 
  A steady increase in illness among children below the age of 
14 years has also been noted. Our children are particularly 
suffering from illnesses affecting the organs of the respiratory 
tract, the alimentary tract, and the nervous system. 
  The number of congenital deformities and development defects 
is also growing. The number of such defects per 1,000 people 
has increased by over 28 percent, while the number of tumors in 
children has risen by almost a quarter. 
  The appearance of a "sick generation" of Russians is shown 
by 
the fact that child invalids alone in the country (by WHO 
estimates) now number hundreds of thousands. In the pre-school 
age group, 15-20 percent of children are suffering chronic 
illnesses, and by the time they leave school almost half of the 
children are limited in their choice of vocation by the state of 
their health. Specialists claim that only one tenth of Russian 
schoolchildren are in practice healthy.

  [Text] Riga, May 11, BNS -- The National AIDS Center has, 
so far, registered six AIDS patients and 12 HIV carriers, the 
center's Director Andris Ferdats told BNS. 
  Two patients have died; one of them this year, Ferdats said. 
  Ferdats claims it is difficult to find how many residents 
have fallen ill with AIDS and how many are HIV carriers because 
seven to 10 years may separate the beginning of illness from the 
moment of contamination. 
  As reported, the World Health Organization and the Latvian 
AIDS Center opened a seminar for journalists Tuesday [10 May] in 
Riga. The workshop is conducted by WHO expert Marie Noelle Belot. 
  The organizers maintain that the media play an important 
role 
in the formation of AIDS-related public opinion.

  [Text] Vilnius, Apr 22, BNS -- One more person has tested 
HIV-positive in Lithuania, increasing the number of reported 
incidence of the AIDS virus to 21, the Lithuanian AIDS Center 
reported. 
  The center said the infected person is around 20 years old, 
a 
seaman, who got infected through sexual contact abroad. The man 
has a family whose members are not infected. 
  The center said 5 HIV-positive persons registered in 
Lithuania earlier already have AIDS. Children were born to two 
AIDS carriers. No presence of the AIDS virus was found in the 
children although the conception occurred when the parents were 
already infected. 
  Four out of 21 registered AIDS-infected people already died, 
but AIDS was the cause of death only in two cases. 
  Experts say that each HIV-positive person is surrounded by 
some 50 to 100 potential AIDS carriers, therefore the number of 
people infected with AIDS in Lithuania may be greater than 
indicated by official statistics.

<F P=106> [Article by David Brown, agriculture correspondent: "Germany </F>
Attacked Over Diseased Sheep Imports"] 
  [Text] Britain will demand tighter animal health and 
welfare controls by Germany after the arrival of batches of 
diseased and aged sheep destined for ritual slaughter by Muslims. 
  Some of the animals, from Poland, were declared unfit for 
human consumption after they were killed at an abattoir in 
Birmingham. They had all been allowed through German border 
checks. 
  Ministers, MPs, vets and animal welfare groups are angry 
about the shipments at a time when the German Health Ministry 
wants the EC to impose fresh curbs on British beef due to fears 
over mad cow disease. Mr Robin Corbett, Labour MP for 
Birmingham, Erdington, will table questions about the diseased 
sheep in the Commons tomorrow. 
  The EC council of health ministers will meet in Brussels on 
March 30 to consider German demands for new EC restrictions on 
British beef despite scientific opinion that it is safe to eat. 
  Mrs Gillian Shephard, the Minister of Agriculture, has told 
Mr Rene Steichen, the EC Farm Commissioner, that the German move 
could cause enormous harm to all beef producers in the EC if it 
destroyed consumers' confidence in beef. She has already 
indicated that Britain may claim compensation from Germany if it 
imposes a unilateral ban on British beef. 
  Mr Keith Meldrum, the Government's chief veterinary officer, 
said yesterday: "I don't want to get into a tit-for-tat row. But 
some of the imported sheep were in such a poor way when they 
arrived at Dover that they should not have been allowed to start 
the journey from Poland. 
  "Obviously we will be urging Germany and other EC countries 
to look again at their checking procedures to prevent further 
incidents of this kind." Mr Meldrum said that in one case a ewe 
gave birth when it arrived at the abattoir. But both it and the 
lamb were in such poor condition that they were slaughtered 
anyway. 
  It is an offence under EC and British law to transport 
pregnant ewes for slaughter for food. 
  British anger centers on four lorryloads, each of about 300 
sheep, sent to Birmingham between Feb 17 and last week. Three 
came from Poland and one from Spain. 
  Sheep in both the Polish and Spanish consignments were found 
to be diseased. Some of the Polish sheep, ageing ewes of between 
four and five years old, were found to be suffering from Caseous 
Lymphadenitis. 
  This highly unpleasant disease results in internal 
abscesses, 
which could cause heavy losses among British flocks. The meat 
from these animals was condemned. 
  The sheep were part of a growing trade in old ewes, shipped 
to Britain to provide cut price mutton for ethnic minorities. It 
sells for about a quarter of the price of meat from British 
sheep. 
  The sheep are killed with a knife without pre-stunning under 
an exemption enjoyed by Muslims and Jews.

<F P=106> [Article by Lotte Mejlhede and Mikkel Thrane: "Effort </F>
Against Narcotics Yields Gain"] 
  [Text] Copenhagen: There are still many large problems with 
narcotics and AIDS in Copenhagen, but it looks like the trend is 
going in the right direction. The municipality of Copenhagen 
still has a widespread and serious narcotics problem, and new 
cases of HIV infection are confirmed daily, but the problems are 
not any longer growing. Nevertheless, it is certainly not a rosy 
picture that the AIDS and Narcotics Council gives in its report 
for 1993. 
  "Our initiatives in the treatment and information side, and 
our condom and needle-exchange programs have borne fruit. The 
situation in Copenhagen is less negative than many other places, 
but it is definitely serious," says Copenhagen Chief Public 
Health Service Physician Claus Lundstedt. 
  In the narcotics area it is particularly falling prices and 
rising consumption of smoking-form heroin that is causing 
concern. But also the group of young people who are in danger of 
becoming addicted have need for concern, according to the 
council report. 
  "We must have more and better treatment services that should 
offer individual treatment plans for each abuser. But if they 
are not motivated to free themselves from their abuse, we aren't 
going to spend money on them," says Lundstedt. 
  The council is trying to find a particular method for 
dealing 
with those drug abusers who are HIV-infected and sick. At the 
same time, a better information campaign will be directed to 
those in socially disadvantaged groups and foreign-language 
speaking groups, whom until now have been more difficult to 
reach. 
  Schoolchildren are to have education on HIV and AIDS, and 
there is going to continue to be free handing out of condoms and 
clean needles. The council is going to try and get better 
statistical data regarding both narcotics and HIV. 
  "There is a huge need for more information, because as it is 
now, we don't have a real insight on the extent of the 
problems," says Lundstedt.

<F P=106> [Article by Louise Fleischer and Bent Winther: "Legal </F>
Experts Warn Against HIV Law"] 
  [Excerpt] Folketing politicians are upset over two verdicts 
issued yesterday, according to which an HIV-infected person 
cannot be convicted for having unsafe sex. 
  The Supreme Court's acquittal of a 36-year-old Haitian 
caused 
particular indignation. After being convicted by a city court 
and the Eastern High Court for having unprotected sex with 23 
women, the 36-year-old man was surprisingly acquitted yesterday. 
Shortly after the Supreme Court's decision, an HIV-infected 
female drug addict was acquitted in a similar case before the 
Western High Court in Arhus. 
  The Conservative spokesman on legal affairs, Helge Adam 
Moller, compared these cases to attempted murder and demanded an 
immediate change in the criminal code. The chairmen of the two 
coalition parties CD [Center Democrats] and the Christian 
People's Party made similar demands. Yesterday, Justice Minister 
Erling Olsen (Social Democrat) issued a brief news release 
stating that the verdicts "could bring about a change in the 
law," so that HIV-infected persons who fail to protect their 
partners could be punished. 
  But prominent experts on the criminal code with whom 
BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has spoken warn emphatically against changing 
the law. Professor of criminal law Gorm Toftegaard Nielsen, 
University of Aarhus, believes this could give women a false 
sense of security. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Reckless Sex"] </F>
  [Text] Reckless driving in an automobile is punishable by 
law, regardless of whether or not anyone is hurt. Wanton actions 
or thoughtlessness that put other people's lives or health in 
danger are punishable. Thus, one might believe that reckless sex 
would also be a criminal offense. But such is not the case. With 
its verdict yesterday, the Supreme Court decided that if an 
HIV-infected person performs unsafe sex without informing his 
partner of the risk, knowing full well that there is a danger of 
a lethal outcome of the act, then it is not a punishable offense. 
  The Supreme Court's verdict was immediately faxed to Arhus, 
where the Western High Court was trying another case involving 
an HIV-infected woman who stood accused of having unsafe sex 
without informing her partner. In accordance with the decision 
of the Supreme Court, the woman was soon able to leave the 
Western High Court after being acquitted. 
  This puts the matter back in the hands of Folketing. The 
Folketing has been under the impression that the deliberate 
spread of infection was covered by existing paragraphs in the 
penal code. But now the Supreme Court has indicated that the law 
does not provide such clear authority. The Folketing must now do 
something about this. Of course, we must not start a witch-hunt 
against HIV-infected persons, but those who are infected must 
recognize their personal responsibility, which is a consequence 
of the fact that they are a potential danger. 
  The entire AIDS system, with its built-in oath of silence 
and 
anonymity, is presently based on voluntarism and trust. But when 
we see examples of flagrant irresponsibility, as illustrated in 
the extreme by the case before the Supreme Court, we cannot help 
but think that the system must be changed. One's own misery is 
not lessened by sharing it with others. Particularly considering 
that AIDS must presently be seen as incurable, it should be a 
crime for a person who knows he is HIV-positive to fail to 
inform his partner of the danger.

<F P=106> [Article by Erik Bjorn Moller: "HIV Law Would Make Demands </F>
on Sex Life"] 
  [Text] A new law that would criminalize sex between 
HIV-infected persons and others will hardly have any significant 
consequences in itself. The law would primarily be a signal to 
the Danish people that they should use condoms. 
<H5>  Rules Must Change </H5>
  This was stated by Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social 
Democrat) to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE after the Supreme Court 
acquitted an HIV-infected 36-year-old Haitian man on Thursday 
[14 April]. The man had been accused of having unsafe sex with 
23 women. 
  As early as Tuesday the legal affairs spokesmen of the 
coalition parties met in an effort to close the loophole in the 
law that led to acquittal of both the Haitian and an Arhus woman 
on Thursday. 
  "If you do not protect your partner, you will be convicted. 
We will no longer accept situations such as these," Olsen said. 
  It is now up to Justice Ministry officials to work out a 
foundation that the politicians can discuss on Tuesday. 
According to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE's information, it is now being 
decided whether the new law "On the Spread of the HIV Infection" 
will be integrated into the penal code or whether an entirely 
new and independent law should be passed. At the same time, 
various aggravating circumstances are being considered, such as 
whether anal sex and other sexual acts should increase the 
punishment. But the big question is whether a violation of the 
law should result in fines or imprisonment. One possibility is 
to consult the penalties for assault when determining the 
punishment. 
  Dr. Michael von Magnus of the Board of Health fears that a 
new law would inhibit "infection-detecting activities" since, 
"even though it is illogical, people will become more afraid." 
  "Strictly from the standpoint of health care, there is no 
indication that laws help prevent sexually transmitted diseases. 
But I understand full well that there are other considerations 
in play, namely people's sense of justice," Dr. von Magnus said.

<F P=106> [Article by Bo Jeppesen: "Irresponsible Sex Will Be </F>
Punished"] 
  [Excerpts] At its weekly chairmen's meeting yesterday, the 
coalition government gave Justice Minister Erling Olsen (Social 
Democrat) the go-ahead to find a way to prevent HIV-infected 
individuals from going unpunished if they practice unsafe sex, 
thereby exposing their partners to the lethal danger of AIDS. 
  Inger Stilling Pedersen of the Christian People's Party and 
Bjarne Orum of the Radical Liberals did not quite agree over 
when and how severely unsafe sex should be punished. But they 
did agree that an HIV-positive person who knowingly engages in 
sex without protection should be punished. [passage omitted] 
  "We want to end this wanton recklessness. This is not 
criminalizing the AIDS disease," Olsen said after the meeting. 
  Consequently, he has instructed his officials to determine 
how the penal code can be changed without having HIV-positive 
persons and AIDS-infected people in general criminalized by the 
politicians. 
  Decriminalization was the motivation for Folketing's 
abolition of the law on sexually transmitted diseases in 1988. 
At the same time, however, it also eliminated the basis for 
punishing reckless sexual acts.

<F P=106> [Article by Paivi Repo: "Blood Donor Center Quizzes Donors </F>
Closely on Their Sexual Behavior"] 
  [Text] On Tuesday [5 April] the Finnish Red Cross adopted a 
new form with which blood donors are more closely than before 
questioned with regard to diseases and sexual behavior. 
  The blood donor has to indicate whether he or she has high 
blood pressure or allergies, has ever had malaria, and whether 
he or she has suffered from a sexually transmitted disease 
during the current year. The organization is trying to pinpoint 
so-called risk users by asking donors more personal questions 
than before. 
  The donor has to indicate whether he or she has had partners 
other than his or her regular sex partner during the past two 
months, whether he has had sexual relations for which he paid 
during the past year, or whether he or his regular partner has 
ever used drugs injected with a needle or narcotic medications. 
Men are asked whether they have had sexual relations with a man. 
  "We don't want any risk to either the donor or the recipient 
stemming from the donation of blood," chief physician Tom 
Krusius emphasized. 
  The donor is reminded in the form that he must be over 18 
but 
under 65 years old and weigh at least 50 kg. If he suspects that 
he may have been infected with HIV or hepatitis, he should not 
give blood for two months following the [suspected] infection. 
During that period he could infect someone else, even though the 
infection does not show up in the test. 
<H5>  Less Than 100 Cases of Infection a Year Found </H5>
  The blood donor center looks for syphilis and hepatitis B 
and 
C, which cause inflammations of the liver. Nearly 100 cases of 
hepatitis infection, nine of syphilis, and only one of HIV were 
found last year. 
  About 300,000 bags of blood a year are given and there are 
180,000 donors. The average donor is a 38-year-old male who has 
given blood eight times. 
  The blood donor center constantly needs new donors when the 
old ones drop out. However, risk users will not do because "the 
epidemiology of the HIV virus has changed. People living in a 
heterosexual relationship and women are becoming infected 
increasingly more often," Tom Krusius said. Homosexual males 
account for nearly half of the cases of HIV infection in Finland. 
  Every blood unit that is given is tested in the laboratory 
and any viruses remaining are killed by heating or chemically 
treating the blood. About 350,000 units of blood products a year 
are administered, but not a single case of HIV infection 
transmitted by blood products has occurred since testing was 
begun, that is, in nine years. Three Finns were infected with 
HIV through blood transfusions abroad.

<F P=106> [Article by Sverre Dalland: "The Military Attacks Sexually </F>
Transmitted Diseases"] 
  [Text] The military estimates that as many as 1,000 
soldiers might have the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia 
without being aware of it. 
  A survey taken at Sessvollmoen six months ago showed that as 
many as four percent of the soldiers were healthy carriers of 
the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia. This does not affect 
their ability to fight, but they could infect others, and there 
is a danger of complications later. This is why the military is 
trying to find an inexpensive and painless test that can 
identify those who are infected with the disease. Chlamydia is 
simple to treat. 
  "Those being inducted into the military are men who only 
seldom visit a doctor. For them the military offers excellent 
health service. In view of the results of the survey at 
Sessvollmoen, we feel that the soldiers should be examined for 
chlamydia. Such an examination could be included in the overall 
health care program for the soldiers. We expect the test to be 
included in an ordinary urinalysis. It is probably not necessary 
to use a painful test involving the urethra. At present various 
tests are being examined both as to practicality and price," 
explains Bjorn Petter Bardal, a doctor at the Military 
Laboratory of Microbiology. 
  The military paper FORUM discusses the chlamydia problem in 
its March issue. Captain Reidar Mundal of the Military Medical 
Service informs us that tests done on recruits indicate that one 
out of 25 might have chlamydia without being aware of it. If the 
disease is not treated, they might infect others and they might 
also become sterile. 
  "During the last few years the number of cases of sexually 
transmitted disease in Norway has gone down considerably. There 
is no reason to believe that there has been a different 
development among the soldiers, who represent the average of the 
male population of their age group. Gonorrhea and syphilis have 
been practically eradicated in Norway, while chlamydia and 
herpes are still a problem," Mundal says to the Military's FORUM.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Gunnar Furuly: "Fear of Virus in Medicine </F>
for Hemophiliacs"] 
  [Text] Director Thor Krey Jacobsen at No-Re-Farm criticizes 
the virus cleansing methods used by an Austrian supplier of 
Norwegian hemophilia medication. 
  The National Health Inspection Agency yesterday halted all 
further use of a particular production run of hemophilia 
medication from the Austrian producer after having confirmed 
that a young hemophiliac had become infected by hepatitis C. The 
health authorities fear that the source originates in a blood 
product from that producer. Norwegian hemophiliacs have been 
asked to submit to testing in order to reveal any possible 
further source of the viral infection. 
  "The pharmaceutical company Octopharma's faulty virus 
cleansing method exposes Norwegian hemophiliacs to the risk of 
contracting serious viral infections," Jacobsen says to 
AFTENPOSTEN. He criticizes Norwegian health authorities for 
protesting EU demands for stricter rules concerning viral 
cleansing of blood plasma. 
  The case is particularly serious because Octopharma has been 
approved by Norwegian health authorities to produce blood 
products from all the Norwegian plasma extracted from the blood 
banks, altogether 40 tons a year. The plasma is brought to 
Octopharma's laboratories in Vienna to be further processed 
into, among other things, medication for hemophiliacs. After 
processing, the finished products are shipped back to the users 
in Norway. 
  Director Jacobsen of No-Re-Farm, which is the representative 
for the foreign pharmaceutical industry in Norway, maintains 
that Octopharma's virus cleansing method is far from 
satisfactory. 
  He points out that most other competitors employ a double 
cleansing method that kills all types of viruses. Jacobsen 
refers to a report from the EU Commission, in which it was 
revealed that as many as 84 cases of hepatitis A have been found 
among hemophiliacs in Italy, Germany, Ireland, and Belgium in 
connection with the use of hemophilia medication from the same 
Austrian pharmaceutical producer in 1992 and 1993. The drug 
manufacturer was criticized in the report for having weak 
procedures for the so-called virus inactivation process. 
  The drug that the EU Commission has brought into focus is 
the 
same one that the National Health Inspection Agency has now 
halted in Norway. 
  Erik Juel, the leader of the Health Director's advisory 
council for transfusion matters, takes the news of the hepatitis 
C infection very seriously, thinking this might be a reason to 
reevaluate Octopharma's virus cleansing method if it turns out 
that the hemophilia medication is the source of the infection. 
Juel, however, stresses the fact that this has not yet been 
established. 
  "Tests of this particular hemophilia medication will not be 
ready for another week," departmental director Anne Marie Horn 
of the National Health Inspection Agency informs us. 
  The report that Jacobsen refers to about the 84 cases of 
hepatitis A infection, is, among other things, the reason why an 
internal council for transfusion matters in the EU has proposed 
ordering double virus cleansing of plasma that will be marketed 
in the EU. 
  Norwegian health authorities have categorically rejected the 
proposal and have asked for an exception for plasma products 
produced from Norwegian blood. The National Health Inspection 
Agency maintains that Norwegian blood is so clean and subjected 
to such strict control procedures that double virus cleansing is 
unnecessary and will drive up prices. The health director's 
advisory council for transfusion matters says that the extra 
cleansing step will result in a 25-percent loss of plasma volume 
and that Norwegian self-sufficiency of plasma products might be 
endangered.

  [Text] Geneva, May 9 (AFP) - A former head of the Swiss 
Red Cross's central laboratory, Alfred Haessig, 73, has been 
charged with causing grievous bodily harm by distributing blood 
contaminated by the AIDS virus, the Swiss news agency ATS 
reported Sunday. 
  ATS, quoting examining magistrate Pierre Marquis, said 
Haessig had been charged last Wednesday and denied the 
accusations against him. 
  Judicial investigations into the spread of AIDS-contaminated 
blood were launched two years ago. So far seven people, 
including five haemophiliacs, have filed complaints that they 
contracted the deadly virus through transfusions in 1985 and 
1986. 
  Lawyer Jacques Barillon, head of an association for the 
defence of infected haemophiliacs, told ATS the charging of 
Haessig was "a considerable victory," following a "long and 
careful inquiry." 
  Switzerland and Spain became in 1986 the first European 
countries to introduce systematic tests of donated blood for 
AIDS, but some slipped through. The following year, according to 
a Swiss television report, the authorities decided on a cover-up 
rather than track down contaminated batches of blood and warn 
recipients. 
  But officials said in March after an investigation that a 
total of 52 people had caught the virus from contaminated blood, 
18 of whom died before the end of last year. 
  The investigation covering 315 suspect blood solutions 
delivered to 70 hospitals between 1982 and 1992 revealed three 
previously unknown people infected by the AIDS virus. 
  Barillon said the charging of Haessig would bring the affair 
into the open and other trials could follow of national and 
local public health officials.

<F P=106> [Article by Greg Neale, environment correspondent: "Creeping </F>
Cow Madness"] 
  [Text] It is already a multi-million pound disaster for 
British agriculture and now it threatens to erupt into a major 
political row between European governments. It is bovine 
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) -- "mad cow" disease -- and few 
would be prepared to say exactly when and where it will end. 
  Next week European Community health ministers will meet to 
discuss a German call for a ban on British beef imports to that 
country. Some German politicians say their country should risk 
breaking Single Market free trade rules because the potential 
health risks are so grave. Nonsense, say British government 
scientists. 
  Meanwhile, the controversy in Britain is reaching new 
heights. Last week, the scientific journal Nature 
called for a start to be made on replacing the British cattle 
population with animals free from the infection -- which the 
magazine estimate would cost &pound;30 billion. 
  Next day, one of the farming industry's loudest voices, the 
magazine Farmers Weekly hit back at what it called "a 
diet of speculation, half-truths and downright lies" and 
denounced what it called "certain publicity-hungry scientists 
promoted by the media more interested in fiction than fact." 
Calling on the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food 
(MAFF) to do more to explain the disease, the magazine 
concluded: "The alternative is to exacerbate the current climate 
of fear and uncertainty..." 
  The fear is not just that shared by farmers worried about 
their livelihood. Could it transfer itself from cows to humans? 
  "Mad Cow" disease was probably first observed on a farm in 
Kent in 1985, when four animals were put down after they were 
observed drooling, staggering before collapsing. Scientists at 
the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Surrey found that the 
animals' brains had become holed and spongelike -- similar 
symptoms to the disease scrapie in sheep and the rare 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), in humans. 
  MAFF scientists concluded that BSE had appeared in cattle 
given processed feed that included remains of diseased sheep. 
New rendering methods, reducing the temperature at which the 
feed was prepared, were enabling the infective agent to survive, 
they concluded. Acting on this advice, in July 1988, John 
MacGregor, then Agriculture Minister, introduced a ban on such 
ruminant protein being used in feed. 
  Cattle confirmed as having BSE have been put down and 
incinerated, with the ashes being buried. In 1989 a further ban 
was introduced, on cattle offal sold for human consumption. That 
year it was officially predicted that 20,000 animals would be 
affected before the feed ban, together with the drying up of any 
supplies already on farms, had its effect. But the spread of BSE 
has confounded original expectations. The Ministry of 
Agriculture said yesterday that by the beginning of last week 
the total number of cattle diagnosed since November 1986 as 
having BSE had risen to 121,898 -- six times the original 
prediction. 
  The ministry believes that the reason more cattle have died 
is that farmers or food renderers kept using infected feed after 
the ban. Last week, MAFF said that the numbers of confirmed BSE 
cases in the first two months of this year showed a 20 per cent 
drop over the same period in 1993 -- proof, the ministry says, 
that the epidemic is waning. 
  Yet there is still controversy. Some 8,004 cattle have died 
from BSE despite being born after the feed ban was 
introduced. MAFF says 5,767 of these were born before the end of 
1988, and were probably fed from remaining infected supplies. 
  That theory has been assailed by critics of the ministry. 
Mark Purdey, a Somerset farmer and independent researcher, 
believes that the use of organophosphate pesticides, used from 
the 1980s as a sheep dip and to treat warble-fly infestation in 
cattle, could have damaged the animals' immune system, exposing 
them to the disease. Ministry scientists, originally dismissive, 
are now reassessing his theories. 
  More recently, researchers have suggested that in some 
cattle, BSE has been "vertically" transmitted from cow to calf. 
Given a long incubation period, such a possibility could make 
the disease harder to eradicate. This month 19 cattle have died 
on farms where MAFF is conducting a seven-year experiment into 
the disease. 
  It is a daunting possibility for the farming industry, which 
has responded angrily. "There is no evidence that this 
disturbing disease can be transferred from cow to calf," 
Farmers Weekly insisted last week. More cautiously, 
MAFF told The Sunday Telegraph: "We have never said 
we have ruled out the possibility of maternal transmission, but 
even if it occurs, our scientists do not believe it will do 
anything other than lengthen the time before the disease is 
eradicated." 
  So how long will it be before the epidemic is ended? Richard 
North, a former environmental health officer turned consultant, 
and a contributor to The Sunday Telegraph, believes 
that MAFF's statistics are being skewed to produce more 
optimistic figures -- claims not surprisingly rejected by the 
ministry. 
  Mr North said: "We have more than 8,000 cattle born after 
the 
feed ban that have subsequently contracted BSE. The claim that 
all of these are affected by illegally retained infected feed 
gets less credible by the hour." 
  One question -- perhaps the most important -- remains. If 
the 
disease has jumped from sheep to cattle -- and cases have also 
been reported in kudu antelope at London Zoo -- could it affect 
humans? 
  That prospect, discounted by most scientists -- including 
MAFF critics such as Mr Purdey -- is considered a possibility by 
Richard Lacey, a Leeds University microbiologist who has been 
studying cases of CJD, a disease with a long incubation period. 
  Reviled by the farming industry and privately disparaged by 
MAFF, he nevertheless insists that there may be a threat. "I'd 
expect an increase in cases of CJD by the early years of the 
next century," he says. "The bottom line is we just don't know 
what risks we may be running."

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- A decade has passed in 
the development of China's nuclear undertakings and nuclear 
safety supervision and administration since it started building 
the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants in the 1980's. 
  During this period, China has built a very efficient nuclear 
safety supervision and administration system. An international 
regulatory review mission from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], a working visit to China recently, concluded that 
China's nuclear safety supervision and administration system 
conforms to the standards of usual international practice. 
  Huang Qitao, director general of the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration [NNSA], which is an independent government 
department with jurisdiction over nuclear safety supervision and 
administration, said in an interview with this reporter: The 
fact that China -- young is terms of nuclear energy development 
-- is able to attain the level it has achieved today in nuclear 
safety supervision and administration can be attributed to its 
active participation in international cooperation. 
  He stressed: China is positive, open-minded, and unreserved 
when it comes to promoting international cooperation and 
exchanges in nuclear safety. NNSA has signed agreements on 
cooperation in nuclear safety with the United States, France, 
Italy, Spain, Pakistan, Germany, and Japan. It has also 
maintained regular contacts and conducted exchanges with a 
number of countries with which no such agreement has been 
signed. China will also sign agreements on cooperation in 
nuclear safety with a number of other countries. 
  Huang Qitao said: In regard to nuclear safety supervision 
and 
administration, China has received generous support from the 
United Nations Development Program [UNDP], IAEA, EC, and other 
international organizations. They have provided China with 
technical training, information, computer software, and other 
data relevant to the safe operations of nuclear plants. He said 
China has also taken an active part in international cooperation 
in nuclear safety under the auspices of the IAEA, including the 
entire processing of drafting of the "International Convention 
on Nuclear Safety" under IAEA sponsorship. China will fulfill 
all the obligations provided in the convention when it is signed. 
  Huang Qitao said: China has gained a great deal of valuable 
experience from its active and frequent participation in 
international cooperation and exchanges. It has also made its 
experience available to other countries without any 
reservations. For this reason, all participants are 
beneficiaries of international cooperation in nuclear safety. 
He noted that China will step up its efforts in international 
cooperation on nuclear safety and take an active part, as ever 
before, in international cooperation sponsored by the IAEA. 
  Annick Carnino, head of the international regulatory review 
mission, also noted in an interview with XINHUA while she was in 
China: The IAEA will strengthen cooperation with China in 
nuclear safety supervision and administration and provide 
assistance, to the extent possible, in making preparations for 
dealing with nuclear emergencies.

  [Text] Beijing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- China has built a very 
effective nuclear safety administration system during the past 
10 years when China started its construction of the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant and the Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Plant in the '80s. 
  During a recent visit to China, the International Regulatory 
Review Team (IRRT) of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) agreed that China's nuclear safety administration system 
reached the standards of usual international practice. 
  China's progress in this area is closely related to its 
active international cooperation, according to Huang Qitao, 
director general of China's National Nuclear Safety 
Administration (NNSA). 
  He said that China's attitude towards international nuclear 
safety cooperation and exchanges is active, open and unreserved, 
adding that NNSA has signed cooperative agreements with a number 
of countries while maintaining regular contacts with some other 
countries having no such agreements with China. 
  Huang noted that China has received support from some 
international organizations such as the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), IAEA and the European Community, 
which provided China with materials, computer software, and 
information concerning safety in nuclear power plants. 
  He said that China also takes part in international 
cooperations of IAEA including the drafting of the International 
Nuclear Safety Convention, and China is ready to discharge all 
obligations when the convention is signed. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Ms. Annick Carnino, head of the 
IRRT of the IAEA, said that IAEA will strengthen its cooperation 
with China in nuclear safety administration and is ready to 
provide China with help in nuclear emergency planning and 
response.

<F P=106> ["Development of Fast Breeder Reactor Must Be Stopped at </F>
Once"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
denounces the South Korean puppets' move to develop a fast 
breeder reactor under the nuclear umbrella of the United States, 
secure larger quantities of plutonium and manufacture nuclear 
weapons with it, as an unpardonable archcrime against the nation. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The white paper on the development of a fast breeder reactor 
by the South Korean puppets, which was recently issued by the 
South Korean National Democratic Front, shows how desperately 
the South Korean puppets work to develop nuclear weapons. 
  The South Korean puppets claim that the fast breeder reactor 
is the "most efficient source of energy" and its development is 
needed for "economic value." Their third-rate trick, however, 
cannot work. 
  They are desperately working to develop this type of reactor 
because they scheme to produce large quantities of nuclear 
weapon- grade plutonium and increase the amount of its 
stockpiling through legitimate import of plutonium under the 
pretext of feeding the fast breeder reactor. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must close down the 
pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose reactor 
and immediately stop the development of a fast breeder reactor 
before it meets with a bitterer denunciation and rejection at 
home and abroad as a nuclear maniac.

<F P=106> ["South Korean Puppets Perpetrate Grave Military Provocation </F>
in DMZ" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets 
perpetrated a grave military provocation Sunday [8 May] by 
deploying an armored vehicle in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) 
South of Ipo-ri, Kumgang County, Kangwon Province, in the 
eastern sector of the front. 
  At about 18:55, the puppets drove an armored vehicle into 
the 
DMZ along the Military Demarcation Line from Sohwa-myon, Inje 
County, South Korean Kangwon Province, and took a firing posture 
against the North side. 
  They introduced recoilless guns and large-calibre 
machine-guns into the DMZ southeast of Kwijon-ri, Jangpung 
County, in the western sector of the front and installed them in 
a position on May 1, 3 and 4. They displayed a war frenzy, 
firing some 70 bullets of large-calibre machine-guns from the 
same spot on May 5. 
  At about 11:15 May 6, hundreds of puppet Army bandits armed 
with large-calibre machine-guns and automatic rifles staged a 
frantic war exercise against the North in broad daylight in the 
DMZ south of height 1211 in the eastern sector of the front, 
getting on the nerves of the North. 
  The South Korean puppets brought some ten trucks loaded with 
hundreds of armed bandits into the DMZ South of Mabang-ri, 
Chorwon County, Kangwon Province, in the central sector of the 
front at about 08:46 May 2. 
  The number of the armed bandits brought by the South Korean 
puppets into the DMZ in the first eight days of May for the 
reinforcement of the positions and military facilities and for 
war exercises totals more than 6,400. 
  This arms buildup of the South Korean puppets, timing to 
coincide with different frantic war exercises against the North 
with the mobilization of uptodate lethal weapons and fighter 
planes in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, is a deliberate 
and premeditated military provocation to drive the situation 
along the Military Demarcation Line to a dangerous phase. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must 
refrain from rash acts, clearly seeing the grave touch-and- go 
situation caused by their war provocation moves on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of 
the National Unification Board, said that the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks are likely to be held next week when the 
International Atomic Energy Agency begins additional inspections 
of North Korea. 
  In a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors today, Deputy 
Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku predicted that positive progress 
[kungjongjogin chinjon] will be made in resolving the nuclear 
issue in the coming week and stressed: Although the replacement 
of fuel rods has been postponed, the sampling [sonjong], 
preservation [pogwan], and special measurement [tuksu kyechuk] 
of samples must be conducted without fail. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi said: The government will no longer 
emphasize the importance of holding South-North dialogue ahead 
of U.S.-North Korean talks [sonhu kwangye-e chipchakhaji anul 
kosimyo], and is now focusing on North Korea's guarantee of 
nuclear transparency in resolving the issue. 
  He stressed: The ROK and the United States firmly share the 
view that if North Korea possesses even half a nuclear weapon, 
it would be regarded as an act of nullifying the joint 
declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "North Korea's Gambling With Nuclear Fuel Rods"] </F>
  [Text] North Korea has reportedly begun to change fuel 
rods at nuclear reactors without the presence of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team. This 
act pours cold water on an atmosphere in which a new phase of 
dialogue finally became possible as North Korea agreed to 
follow-up inspections, including additional inspections of its 
radiochemical laboratory, which has been an issue for a long 
time. 
  North Korea probably has the hidden aim to baffle its 
counterparts, the IAEA and the United States, by even more 
complicating the nuclear issue to have a favorable negotiating 
position. I am greatly concerned about North Korea's act 
because it is an extremely dangerous gamble that may cause a 
crisis. 
  The international community, including the United States, 
repeatedly warned North Korea that if North Korea proceeded with 
changing the fuel rods on its own, they would suspend dialogue 
with North Korea and apply sanctions through the UN Security 
Council. Accordingly, if North Korea's notification to the IAEA 
that it began changing the fuel rods means a full-pledged 
change, sanctions against North Korea will become inevitable and 
the situation on the Korean peninsula will become more unstable. 
  When North Korea agreed to the additional inspections of the 
radiochemical laboratory and it appeared likely that the IAEA 
inspection team would enter North Korea on 17 May to start its 
inspection activities, we expected a small breakthrough in 
resolving the nuclear issue. 
  Our expectation was based on the view that North Korea would 
postpone changing the fuel rods to seek a solution to the 
nuclear problem at the third round of talks with the United 
States. 
  The contents of North Korea's message to the IAEA leaves 
room 
for negotiations. The message says that North Korea will allow 
the preservation of fuel rods for samples if North Korean-U.S. 
high- level talks result in a package solution to the nuclear 
problem. Also, the position of the IAEA and the United States is 
that they will prepare countermeasures after receiving the 
results of additional and follow-up inspections, which will be 
conducted as planned despite North Korea's notification. 
  The IAEA inspection team plans to carry out additional 
inspections of the radiochemical laboratory in addition to basic 
activities -- such as replacing batteries and film in the 
monitoring camera installed at the experimental reactor, whose 
fuel rods are supposed to be changed this time, and confirming 
the seals of the reactor. U.S. policy is that after receiving 
the results of these inspections, it will decide whether to hold 
the third round of talks with North Korea. 
  North Korea's attempt to change the fuel rods under this 
situation is not a wise decision although it might be a strategy 
to lead negotiations in a direction favorable to North Korea. 
Changing the fuel rods without IAEA taking samples will only 
increase the international community's suspicion that North 
Korea is trying to hide its extraction of nuclear materials. In 
addition, it will make dialogue with the United States, which 
North Korea desires, impossible and will possibly result in 
sanctions against North Korea through the UN Security Council. 
  The international community will hardly put up with North 
Korea's dangerous gamble any longer. North Korea is urged to 
find a way to negotiations while there is the possibility of 
dialogue.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles published in 15 May Seoul vernacular newspapers on 
North Korea starting to replace the fuel rods at its five 
megawatt-class atomic reactor without the presence of 
International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, inspectors. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik on the true intention behind North Korea 
replacing the fuel rods. The article begins: The ROK, the 
United States, the IAEA, and Western countries agree that if 
"North Korea replaces the fuel rods without the presence of the 
IAEA," it will lead to a "catastrophe." Citing that such a 
decision by North Korea is a "reckless plot" to further their 
own interest, the article stresses that "no decision can be 
made" until the IAEA inspection team makes a "report" on the 
result of its inspection. After noting that North Korea's 
decision to replace the fuel rods is a way to hold the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the article points out the replacement 
work may only be in its preparatory stage and that the actual 
replacement of the fuel rods has not begun. The article 
concludes that the judgment of the IAEA inspection team will 
determine if North Korea has actually started replacing the fuel 
rods at its atomic reactor. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO on page 3 publishes a 900-word 
article by Nam Chan-sun in Washington on the true intention of 
North Korea's decision to replace the fuel rods of its atomic 
reactor without the presence of the IAEA inspection team. The 
article gives four reasons for such a decision: First, North 
Korea publicized its decision to replace the fuel rods in order 
to hold the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date. 
Second, there is a high possibility that North Korea is using 
the fact that the IAEA inspection team, which will leave for 
North Korea on 15 May, will inspect the five megawatt-class 
atomic reactor anyway. Third, the decision is aimed at 
obtaining publicity from home and abroad of its position by 
rejecting the claims by the United States and the IAEA that the 
replacement of the fuel rods must not be carried out without the 
presence of the IAEA. Fourth, there is a possibility that it 
was necessary to replace the fuel rods to maintain the safety of 
North Korea's facilities and meet technological demands, as 
North Korea claims. The article concludes by reporting that no 
decision can be made until the IAEA inspection team concludes 
its inspection. 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 
800-word 
editorial entitled: "The North Korean Nuclear Issue Is Bringing 
About UN Sanctions." The editorial notes that it seems that the 
United States and the ROK have been "dragged along by North 
Korea's nuclear strategy." Noting that North Korea has a habit 
of unilaterally severing and then resuming negotiations at the 
last moment, its decision to replace the fuel rods is intended 
to "drive a wedge" in holding the third round of DPRK-U.S. 
talks. Citing that North Korea is trying to settle for a 
package deal of "improving relations with the United States, 
obtain support for its light-water reactor, achieve economic 
cooperation, and conclude a peace agreement on the Korean 
peninsula," the editorial notes that since North Korea's true 
intention has now become clear, "the United States must take a 
more resolute measure" regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. 
The editorial reports that if North Korea does not stop the 
replacement of the fuel rods and does not receive IAEA 
inspections, this will only lead to sanctions by the UN Security 
Council. The editorial repeatedly urges that as a responsible 
member of the international society, North Korea must work to 
resolve the nuclear issue peacefully. 
  KYONGHYANG SINMUN on page 3 publishes a 1,200-word article 
by 
Yi Chong-yon in Washington on North Korea's unilateral 
notification that it has started the replacement of the fuel 
rods at its atomic reactor. The article reports that diplomatic 
sources in Washington analyze that North Korea's decision to 
replace the fuel rods is a "strategic card to realize the 
DPRK-U.S. talks at an early date." The article reports that 
diplomatic sources feel it is very unlikely that North Korea 
replaced the fuel rods, but has only started safety inspections 
for replacement. The article continues that the United States 
will decide what to do after obtaining results by the IAEA 
inspection team. The article concludes that it will be decided 
to present the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council after 
the IAEA carries out its inspection next week. 
  The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Kim Cha-su entitled "The Government's Reaction to the 
Replacement of Fuel Rods by North Korea." Referring to the 
government's embarrassment regarding North Korea's 14 May 
announcement that it has independently begun changing fuel rods 
at its five megawatt-class nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, the 
article writes: "This is because the government has so far 
adhered to the strong position that it will resume the 
discussions on sanctions against North Korea if it begins 
changing fuel rods at the nuclear reactor without IAEA 
supervision." 
  Noting the government's analysis of North Korea's public 
announcement that it has begun changing fuel rods, the article 
reports that the government will formulate concrete plans to 
deal with North Korea after IAEA inspectors complete their 
inspection activities in North Korea. 
  The article reports: "The government stresses that it has no 
other choice but discuss sanctions against North Korea with 
other countries concerned if the IAEA declares the continuity of 
the nuclear safeguards has been suspended, and that it has 
decided to convey such a position to North Korea through various 
channels," referring to the government's attention to North 
Korea's remarks to the IAEA that the issue of selecting and 
preserving fuel rods can be resolved at the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean talks. The article continues that the 
government is ready to deal with North Korea, believing that 
this week it will be determined if the North Korean nuclear 
issue is resolved peacefully. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 900-word 
article by Washington-based reporter Chong Hae-yong entitled: 
"Washington's Position on North Korea's Replacement of Fuel 
Rods." Referring to the contents of North Korea's message sent 
to the IAEA on 12 May and analysis by Washington-based sources 
of the background of North Korea's replacement of the fuel rods, 
the article reports that North Korea's announcement to change 
fuel rods is intended to hold negotiations with the IAEA, as 
well as to discuss economic cooperation and establishment of 
diplomatic relations with the United States. 
  CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 3 a 700-word article by 
reporter U Tae-chun entitled: "The Present Conditions of an 
Experimental Nuclear Reactor in Yongbyon." The article reports 
that "North Korea has operated an experimental nuclear reactor 
in Yongbyon since 1986." The article concludes: "Western 
experts believe that the radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon 
will turn out to be a nuclear reprocessing plant after noting 
its size based on data provided by North Korea to the IAEA and 
the basic reason for the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear 
reactor and the method of extracting plutonium from the spent 
nuclear fuel."

  [Text] Seoul, May 16 (YONHAP) -- Six in every 10 South 
Korean adults believe there is the danger of North Korea 
provoking a war on the Korean peninsula, an opinion survey said 
Monday. 
  The poll, taken by the Korea Gallup Co., showed that 11.8 
percent of the pollees replied they believe there is much danger 
of a war being unleashed by the North kroeans and another 46.1 
percent said they think there is slight danger of such war. 
  The survey, conducted in a contract awarded by the 
Information Ministry, was made toward 1,000 people aged 20 or 
more across the country on may 2-3. 
  Of the respondents, 37.0 percent said they don't see any 
danger of North Korea provoking a war. 
  The percentage of those who denied war danger was high, 54.4 
percent, among those with college or higher educational 
background. 
  As reasons for denial of the danger of war, 16.9 percent 
gave 
the flow of international situation against war, 12.2 percent 
lack of economic strength to wage a war on the part of North 
Korea, and 10.9 percent the North's inability to fight a war on 
their own. 
  As to the fate of the Kim Il-song system, 33.6 percent said 
they think the system would survive while 66.7 percent replied 
it would collapse either gradually or in the foreseeable future. 
  Asked if they think North Korea would open itself up, 7.5 
percent said it would open totally, 61.3 percent it would 
partially, and 27.2 percent it wouldn't open at all. 
  On the question of whether to resume the Team Spirit 
exercise, 45.7 percent said the training should be held 
regardless of North Korea's attitude and 35.0 percent said 
decision on the issue should be made depending on North Korea's 
attitude. 
  Only 19.3 percent said they think the exercise shouldn't be 
held regardless of the attitude of North Korea. 
  Concerning the nuclear question, 39.1 percent said they 
believe North Korea has already developed nuclear weapons, and 
21.9 percent North Korea is in the threshold of developing them. 
  Mere 3 percent said they believe North Korea has no ability 
at all to produce nuclear weapons. 
  Of the total pollees, 85.1 percent said they think North 
Korea's human rights conditions are very serious, and 93.4 
percent said North Korea is experiencing a difficult economic 
situation. 
  Meanwhile, 69.7 percent of the pollees supported the 
government policy of accepting North Korean loggers in Siberia. 
  About North Korean escapees in China, 40.9 percent said 
South 
Korea should accept them while 22.6 percent said the government 
should help them resettle in China or other third countries. 
  Another 29.2 percent said the matter should be handled very 
prudently taking into account China-North Korea relations, and 
only 6.2 percent said South Korea shouldn't accept them.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa denied Tuesday [10 May] that Japan and the United 
States concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. 
can redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture 
in case of emergency as was claimed in a soon-to-be published 
book. 
  "Such a secret agreement does not exist as the government 
has 
been saying," Kakizawa told a press conference. 
  According to a book to be published Thursday, Japan and the 
U.S. concluded the secret deal during summit talks between then 
Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon in 
November 1969. 
  The author of the book is Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor 
of international politics at Kyoto Industrial University, who, 
as Sato's special envoy, negotiated the reversion of Okinawa to 
Japanese control with Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security 
affairs adviser.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- The United Nations atomic 
watchdog has asked the Japanese Government to reconfirm the 
amount of plutonium held up in processing equipment of a 
Japanese nuclear fuel fabrication plant after learning the 
amount was unexpectedly high, sources said Monday [9 May]. 
  The sources said a massive 70 kilograms of plutonium was 
held 
up at the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
facility in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, over the past five and a 
half years since the plant started operations. 
  The fact has alerted the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) since such a large amount of plutonium held up in the 
plant could hamper effective application of safeguards against 
unauthorized diversions of plutonium, the sources said. 
  A corporation spokesman stressed, however, that employees at 
the facility have confirmed the existence of the plutonium 
through measurements done with special equipment and denied the 
plutonium in question is unaccounted for. 
  But the sources said the IAEA is concerned that any 
discrepancy in calculations could compromise its purpose as a 
body established to regulate the use of nuclear fuel and prevent 
the spread of nuclear weapons. 
  The facility, which began operations in October, 1988, 
supplies fuel to the fast breeder reactor Monju on the Sea of 
Japan coast in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture. 
  Sources within the nuclear power industry said that in 
April, 
the IAEA requested that the government confirm whether the 
amount of plutonium held up in the plant actually matched the 
corporation's own measurement. 
  Equipment to monitor plutonium amounts in the facility was 
jointly developed by the corporation and the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in the U.S. State of New Mexico. 
  A measurement by the equipment is believed to have a margin 
of error of 5-10 percent, which means that if the amount of 
held-up plutonium is as much as 70 kilograms, enough plutonium 
to make an atomic bomb could easily escape detection. 
  Paul Leventhal, president of the nongovernmental 
Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute said 70 kilograms is 
more than the amount of plutonium North Korea is alleged to have 
secretly diverted from its own nuclear facilities. 
  Leventhal said there is no proof Japan is diverting 
plutonium 
for a weapons program, but called on the IAEA to closely 
regulate the Japanese facility to ensure fair treatment for all 
countries using nuclear power. 
  In a letter dated May 4 to U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, Leventhal calls for the shutting down of the 
facility. 
  Leventhal told Christopher the 70 kilograms, about 10 
percent 
of the annual plutonium output at the plant, is "an astounding 
figure." 
  "Under the circumstances, Japan should be prepared 
voluntarily to suspend operation of the plant in the interest of 
its often-stated commitment to the complete transparency of the 
peaceful nature of its plutonium program," Leventhal wrote. 
  A spokesman for the Science and Technology Agency's 
safeguards division said the IAEA and the government gauge the 
amount of plutonium held up in the plant once every month, and 
added it is impossible to divert the plutonium from the facility.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- Yielding to mounting foreign 
pressure, a government energy policy advisory panel is set to 
propose reviewing Japan's ambitious plan to use plutonium for 
energy, government officials said Wednesday [11 May]. 
  The proposal by the Advisory Committee for Energy will lead 
to a policy shift by the Atomic Energy Commission, the nation's 
top energy policy board, which is now working on reviewing 
Japan's long-standing policy of hoarding plutonium. 
  In an interim report to be presented in early June to the 
minister of international trade and industry, the committee's 
subpanel on nuclear energy will propose delaying construction of 
a second plant to reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce 
plutonium, the officials said. 
  "The commission's review is likely to reflect a policy 
change 
by the advisory panel," said a senior official at the Agency of 
Natural Resources and Energy. 
  The official said the policy change also reflects a glut in 
global uranium supply and the resulting fall in demand for 
plutonium as a result of the end of the Cold War. Uranium is a 
key nuclear fuel. 
  "With uranium prices and demand for plutonium down, it will 
be hard to make ends meet given the cost of building related 
facilities," he said. 
  Construction of the plant is a key part of Japan's program 
to 
develop widespread use of nuclear technology for fast-breeder 
reactors that produce more plutonium than they consume. 
  Japan is the world's only country to continue work on 
development of fast-breeder reactors and has been accused of 
undermining nuclear nonproliferation as plutonium is a key 
component in nuclear weapons. 
  Although Japan has flatly denied any intention of developing 
nuclear weapons, its pro-plutonium policy has spawned 
speculation that it may build its own nuclear arsenal in the 
future. 
  The committee's subpanel report will also propose reserving 
spent nuclear fuel as it is, describing it as "resources which 
are temporarily reserved" for future use. Plutonium can be 
extracted from spent fuel. 
  The proposal suggests that nuclear policymakers still weigh 
the value of domestically processed plutonium and hold out 
prospects for future use of plutonium. 
  Japan relies heavily on nuclear power for its energy needs, 
with some 30 percent of the nation's electricity being generated 
by 42 nuclear plants.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- A government advisory panel 
Thursday [12 May] outlined an interim report on Japan's nuclear 
power policy that proposes review of its longstanding policy of 
encouraging plutonium use, a Trade Ministry official said. 
  The report drafted by a subpanel of the Advisory Committee 
for Energy calls for delaying construction of a second plant to 
reprocess spent nuclear fuel to reproduce plutonium. 
  Japan will decide on a schedule for construction around 
2010, 
according to the report to be presented to the International 
Trade and Industry Minister June 10. 
  The second plant was originally scheduled to begin 
operations 
around 2010. 
  The review reflects global concern over nuclear 
proliferation 
in Japan and the recent setback in nuclear recycling projects in 
Europe, the official at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry said. 
  The official said the report proposes limiting Japan's 
nuclear recycling to a nuclear power plant in Rokkasho, Aomori 
Prefecture, and its attached facilities until the second 
reprocessing plant is completed. 
  The report describes the postponement as a temporary setback 
in the nation's policy of promoting plutonium use, citing the 
heavy dependence on nuclear energy. 
  The subpanel report proposes reserving excessive plutonium 
produced at the Rokkasho plant for future use.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 13 TASS -- Japan imposes nuclear game 
rules on the world while accusing Russia of developing new 
weapon types, concluded Russian experts when 70 kilos of 
unregistered plutonium were founded in reactors of a Japanese 
splitting fuel plant at the Tokai-Mura Nuclear Center. 
  Seventy kilos are enough to make eight nuclear warheads. 
Specialists put into question Japanese claims that the pure 
plutonium powder "stuck" to the equipment and pipes. 
  While storing unregistered raw materials for nuclear bombs 
Japan continues to spread sensational rumors on Russian 
development of a new small-size neutron bomb on the basis of red 
mercury. It gives the new bomb's parameters - a size of a 
coffee cup, and address and possibilities of its use - Bosnia, a 
terror weapon. [sentence as received] 
  In the opinion of experts, this is done to conceal Japanese 
secret nuclear activities. According to IAEA norms, eight kilos 
of plutonium are enough to make a bomb and dangerous for 
non-proliferation of nuclear arms. 
  The revealed materials make one doubt "full transparency of 
the plutonium peace use programs" against the background of 
Japanese claims it is a model state in the sphere of nuclear 
control, said the experts. 
  This opinion is confirmed by a classified report of the U.S. 
Institute for Control over Nuclear Materials submitted to the 
U.S. secretary of state. Some paragraphs of the report have 
leaked and were used by the press. 
  Deputy head of the Russian Ministry for Nuclear Power 
Engineering's Information and Public Relations Department 
Vitaliy Nasonov told ITAR-TASS the report on Japanese plutonium 
requires more studies, as it is hard to reveal the plutonium 
source.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan will have to transport 
plutonium by sea more than 100 times over the next decade under 
its plans to have its spent nuclear fuel recycled in Europe, a 
Tokyo- based antinuclear institute said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  Jinzaburo Takagi, head of the Citizen's Nuclear Information 
Center, said, "ships loaded with radioactive substance will make 
the round trip between Europe and Japan in a period shorter than 
a month." 
  The frequent transportation would result in harsh criticism 
from countries along the ships' route, he said. 
  The Japanese freighter Akatsuki Maru carried plutonium from 
France back to Japan from November 1992 to January 1993, 
sparking widespread protests both at home and abroad. 
  Japan has signed contracts to have about 7,100 tons of spent 
nuclear fuel recycled into plutonium in Britain and France. 
  Under the center's calculation, 45 tons of plutonium will be 
produced from the spent fuel by around 2010. 
  Also, Japan will have to take back about 3,200 cylinders of 
vitrified high-level radioactive waste and 150,000 drums of 
low-level radioactive waste, that are produced in the recycling 
process, they said. 
  The 45 tons of plutonium must be transported by sea in 20 
shipments, high-level radioactive waste in 30-60 shipments and 
the low-level radioactive waste in 50-150 shipments, they said. 
  Takagi criticized the government for having made only 
limited 
preparations to accept the waste as it has decided merely to 
store 1,440 cylinders of vitrified waste at a reprocessing 
facility now under construction in the village of Rokkasho, 
Aomori Prefecture, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Japan's top nuclear policy 
board unveiled a plan Wednesday [18 May] to slow down remarkably 
its plutonium use for nuclear recycling, facing criticism from 
abroad and domestic circles that Tokyo may develop nuclear arms 
out of the substance. 
  The Atomic Energy Commission has worked on revising Japan's 
long-term nuclear energy policy, in which the country's 
plutonium use would be considerably delayed from the current 
program. 
  Aside from the criticism, the changes in the policy are 
being 
made as it has become less necessary for Japan to hastily make 
use of plutonium energy as prospects for future uranium supplies 
have brightened, officials said. 
  The committee headed by Science and Technology Agency chief 
Mikio Omi will draw up a final plan by the end of June, they 
said. 
  The new program requires Japan to reprocess spent nuclear 
fuel as the need arises so that excess plutonium would not be 
produced, and to store excess spent nuclear fuel for a long 
period, the officials said. 
  Under the current plan set in June 1987, spent nuclear fuel 
would be swiftly recycled into plutonium and be reused. 
  The new policy does not change the government's fundamental 
stance that it is indispensable for Japan to establish a nuclear 
energy recycling system as the country has only scarce energy 
resources, they said. 
  Another point of the plan, to recycle all of the country's 
spent nuclear fuel, is also kept intact, they said. 
  Japan will proceed with only limited nuclear recycling for 
the moment, however, including some recycling of plutonium in 
light water reactors, they said. 
  The country's long-term nuclear energy policy was drawn up 
for the first time in 1956 and is revised every five years by 
the committee. 
  The current program calls for Japan to put into operation a 
reprocessing plant in the village of Rokkasho, Aomori 
Prefecture, now under construction and expected to be completed 
by around 2010. 
  But the new policy cites that the scale and other plans on 
the plant will be decided by 2010, the officials said. 
  Japan's only reprocessing plant is being operated in 
Tokai-Mura, Ibaraki Prefecture, and the Rokkasho plant would be 
the second in operation. 
  The Tokai-Mura plant has had frequent problems and has not 
begun full operation. The delay in operation of the Rokkasho 
plant would leave Japan with large quantities of spent nuclear 
fuel. 
  But Japan will store the fuel until the country is able to 
recycle in the future, they said. 
  Japan will also back down from its current policy on 
development of fast breeder reactors, they said. The planned 
start of construction of a demonstration fast breeder reactor 
will be delayed from the late 1990s to the early 2000s, they 
said. 
  The launch of a commercial fast breeder reactor was not 
changed from the current target of around 2030. But fast 
breeder reactors will be consistent with light water reactors 
under the new plan, in comparison with the current policy in 
which they are placed as Japan's future main reactors, they said. 
  Also, Japan will not breed plutonium as long as fast breeder 
reactors are at the experimental level, the officials said. 
  Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor "Monju" reached 
criticality in April, the point at which the reactor's 
fissionable material is capable of sustaining a chain reaction 
at a constant level. 
  Monju, in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, can breed more 
plutonium 
than it consumes, causing several countries abroad to express 
concern that Japan may use the substance for future nuclear 
armament. 
  As a result of the changes in fast breeder reactor 
development, Japan's amounts of both supply and demand of 
plutonium by 2010 would be reduced to between 69 and 79 tons, 
the officials said. 
  The current plan said the amount of the supply would be 85 
tons and demand 80-90 tons.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
denied Thursday [12 May] that Japan had secretly agreed with the 
United States in 1969 to allow Washington to deploy nuclear arms 
on Okinawa island to defend Japan and America's other Asian 
allies in times of emergency. 
  "Although former Prime Minister (Eisaku) Sato and U.S. 
President (Richard) Nixon were recently alleged to have signed 
the secret agreement, such a pact does not in fact exist," Hata 
told the House of Representatives plenary session. 
  "My government will firmly continue to live up to Japan's 
three antinuclear principles," Hata said in response to Tomiichi 
Murayama, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan, 
SDPJ], the nation's No. 2 opposition party. 
  The three principles bar Japan from manufacturing and 
authorizing foreign nations to bring to or store nuclear weapons 
on Japanese soil. 
  Hata was referring to a recent allegation in a book authored 
by Kei Wakaizumi, a former special emissary of Sato, in 
negotiations with the Nixon administration, that led up to a 
1969 accord to return then U.S.-held Okinawa to Japanese 
sovereignty without the presence of nuclear weapons there. 
  Wakaizumi, a former Defense Agency researcher, alleged Sato 
and Nixon signed the top-secret memorandum at the White House on 
November 21, 1969. The memorandum says Japan is aware of U.S. 
expectations for a favorable response to possible U.S. requests 
to deploy nuclear weapons on Okinawa in times of a contingency. 
  Wakaizumi, who negotiated with then National Security 
Adviser 
Henry Kissinger on behalf of Sato who sought Okinawa's return 
without nuclear arms, quoted Sato as saying, "Because Mr. Nixon 
signed (the memorandum) with his full name, I also signed it 
with my full name." 
  The former lecturer at the Johns Hopkins University said 
Sato 
demanded that the signing be shrouded in secrecy for fear of 
angering Japanese media people, many of whom were then balking 
at the Japan-U.S. security treaty. 
  Murayama told the Diet, "Then the special envoy of Prime 
Minister Sato exposed the secret agreement that authorizes the 
United States to deploy nuclear weapons in times of a 
contingency, which was inked after the announcement of the 
Japan-U.S. communique in November 1969." 
  Hata issued his denial after the SDP leader rapped the 
government for allowing the presence of U.S. military bases in 
Okinawa by referring to the recent crash of two F-15 U.S. jet 
fighters, which Murayama said pained Okinawan residents. 
  Hata also spurned Murayama's demand to immediately resume 
negotiations with North Korea to establish diplomatic ties with 
Pyongyang. 
  "Japan will never normalize its relations with North Korea 
unless the country clears up international suspicions over its 
suspected nuclear weapons program," the premier said. 
  He urged Pyongyang to comply with the U.N. Security Council 
presidential statement, which called for North Korea to allow 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to conduct unimpeded 
inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
  On a related topic, Hata also said Japan's Constitution 
prohibits the country's involvement in collective security, 
brushing aside concerns that his government may move toward 
active military actions overseas. 
  "I think collective security is beyond the boundary of the 
Constitution, and it is in practice not permitted," he said. 
  "I have no intention to change" the conventional 
interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese 
Government on the issue, he said. 
  He was responding to a query by Yohei Kono, president of the 
Liberal Democratic Party, the No. 1 opposition party. 
  Although Japan has the right for collective security in 
terms 
of international law, Hata argued the war-denouncing 
Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum necessary" rights 
for self-defense. 
  Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed 
legislation to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula. 
  The issue requires a "highly political judgment" and "should 
be considered cautiously," he said. 
  The remark is an apparent effort to distance himself from 
some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation 
for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis 
over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. 
  However, in a reply to Murayama's similar question, Hata 
said, "The government is now considering such legislation to 
eliminate any ambiguities (concerning a response to a 
contingency) as it should appeal to the public to endorse it 
when necessary."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Japan and the United States 
concluded a secret agreement in 1969 under which the U.S. can 
redeploy and transport nuclear weapons in Okinawa Prefecture in 
case of emergency, according to a book to be published Thursday 
[12 May]. 
  Kei Wakaizumi, a former professor of international politics 
at Kyoto Industrial University, said in his new book that the 
two countries concluded the secret deal during summit talks 
between then Prime Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard 
Nixon in November 1969. 
  According to the book, a draft of agreed minutes to the 
Japan-U.S. Joint Communique Nov. 21, 1969, stated in part, "In 
times of great emergency the United States government will 
require the reentry of nuclear weapons and transit rights in 
Okinawa with prior consultation with the Government of Japan." 
  The agreed minutes also said, "The Government of Japan, 
appreciating the United States Government's requirements in 
times of great emergency as stated above by the President, will 
meet these requirements without delay when such prior 
consultation takes place." 
  As Sato's special envoy, Wakaizumi at the time was 
negotiating the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese control with 
Henry Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser. 
  The U.S. had maintained a presence of nuclear weapons in 
Okinawa before the territory was returned to Japan by the Nixon 
administration in 1972. 
  Prime Minister Sato had insisted then that Japan would 
reject 
the reentry of nuclear weapons into Okinawa even if there were 
prior consultations.

  [Text] North Korea has pushed ahead with the development of 
nuclear weapons since 1986 and now has a considerable amount of 
plutonium. This was revealed by Kim Chae-ho, who defected 
recently to the South, during a press conference held at the 
Seoul Press Center this afternoon. Before he defected, Mr. Kim 
was the head of a work team at the Sanamchon Chemical Complex, a 
uranium refinery plant under the North Korean Ministry of 
Nuclear Energy. Mr. Kim said North Korea began to develop 
nuclear weapons in 1986 and was able to produce plutonium in 
1988. 
  Mr. Kim, who escaped from North Korea on 2 February because 
the North Korean authorities became aware of the fact that he 
misappropriated $5,000 in foreign currency, said plutonium has 
been continuously produced in the nuclear facilities in 
Yongbyon. He claimed that although he does not know whether 
North Korea has a nuclear weapon, North Korea has attained a 
considerable technological standard for the development of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Meanwhile, brothers Hwang Kwang-chol and Hwang Kwang-il said 
they crossed the border to China last June because they were 
caught stealing food and lived a life of those who enter China 
illegally. Elder brother Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that because 
of the haphazard food rationing in North Korea, stealing food is 
a frequent practice there.

  [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- Despite its lingering 
economic difficulties, North Korea has invested heavily in 
uranium mining and production, a recent North Korean defector 
said here on Monday. 
  "I have no idea whether North Korea presently possesses 
nuclear arms because they have been developing them in utter 
secrecy. But, I can tell North Korea's nuclear development has 
reached a dangerous point," the defector, Kim Tae-ho, said in a 
press conference. 
  In the North, Kim, age 35, had worked at the Atomic Power 
Industrial Ministry. He was the head of a waste water disposal 
team at the Namchon Joint Chemical Industrial Co. run directly 
by the Atomic Power Ministry. 
  He said uranium ores are being mined at several mines 
including the one in Sunchon, South Pyongan Province: January 
industrial mine at Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province: and Wolam 
mine at Kumchon, North Hwanghae Province. 
  "The uranium ores from these mines are shipped to two 
uranium 
refineries at the April Industrial Co. in North Pyongan Province 
and Namchon Chemical Co. in North Hwanghae Province," he said. 
  The re-refinery August Industrial Co. in Yongbyon, Kim said, 
extracts plutonium for nuclear weapons and performs work related 
to the production of uranium fuel rods. 
  He said that Namchon Chemical Co. has about 8,000 workers 
and 
turns out 80%-pure uranium. 
  "Many of the workers there are exposed to radioactivity, 
complaining of vocational diseases such as liver ailment, 
depilation and leukosis," the defector said. 
  Productivity at these workshops, however, is extremely low 
due chiefly to superannuated facilities, he said. 
  For instance, Kim said, uranium ores transportation is 
sluggish as many trucks are idled due to the lack of tires and 
mechanical troubles are reported often at mining equipment. 
  He said he was born in Jilin Province, northern China, 
because of which he had been discriminated against. "Besides, I 
was involved in a swindle case, which made me decide to defect 
to the South," he said. 
  Two youthful brothers who came to the South along with Kim 
Tae-ho spoke of terrible food conditions in the North. 
  Hwang Kwang-chol, 20, said that due to food shortage, women 
in childbed are often stricken with serious diseases and it is 
not rare babies fail to walk even at two due to malnutrition. 
  Hwang said his own mother is serving a 15-year prison term 
after she stole a bag of corn from a neighbor in 1987. 
  "Together with my younger brother, Kwang-il, 18, I crossed 
the Tuman River last June and had since been living in Yanji 
before we boarded a South Korean freighter with the help of an 
ethnic Korean in China," Hwang said. 
  The three North Koreans arrived in South Korea last 
Saturday.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Reiterates DPRK's Stand on </F>
Replacement of Fuel Rods" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry today answered a question put by KCNA regarding 
the beginning of the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station. 
  He said: 
  As is known, the replacement of fuel rods has begun at our 5 
megawatt experimental nuclear power station according to its 
operation plan. 
  This refueling is part of the undertakings to normalize our 
peaceful nuclear activities. 
  As we have clarified time and again, we could not freeze the 
operation of the graphite moderated reactor system for an 
indefinite period, incurring economic losses, since the prospect 
of implementation of the DPRK-USA agreement on converting the 
graphite moderated reactor system to a light water reactor 
system became dim as a result of the abortion of the third round 
of talks. 
  Moreover, the replacement of fuel rods at the 5 megawatt 
experimental nuclear power station could not be delayed any 
longer in view of its technical safety. 
  That is why we sent a telex message to the International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on April 19 informing it of our 
replacement plan in advance and requesting it to observe it and 
promptly take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel 
rods. 
  Later, we sent telex messages to the agency on four 
occasions, repeatedly requesting it to take relevant measures 
including the removal of seals for a smooth operation of the 
facilities. And we agreed to all the demands of the agency with 
regard to its observation, except for the selection and 
preservation of the fuel rods, a matter which is beyond our 
unique status, and issued in good time entry visas to the 
agency's inspectors. 
  Moreover, we allowed, as an exception, inspection activities 
for the continuity of safeguards requested by the Secretariat of 
the agency and even an "additional inspection" which it 
described as an "uncompleted inspection" during its inspection 
in March, taking into consideration the fact that the United 
States withdrew the precondition of "exchange of special envoys 
between the North and the South of Korea" which it had insisted 
on. 
  The Secretariat of the agency, however, persistently avoided 
sending a group of inspectors on unreasonable pretexts and did 
not take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel rods. 
Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove 
seals and start taking out fuel rods for safety reasons. 
  In this connection, we notified the agency that the whole 
course of the replacement of fuel rods would be placed under a 
strict watch of the agency's cameras. 
  All this was motivated by our utmost sincerity to prove the 
non-diversion of the replaced fuel rods to non-peaceful purposes 
and demonstrate the uprightness of our nuclear activities. 
  It is self-evident that such inspection activities falling 
under the categories of routine and ad hoc inspections as 
selection and preservation of some of the fuel rods can never be 
allowed in view of our unique status following a temporary 
suspension of the effectuation of our declared withdrawal from 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). 
  To select and preserve some of the fuel rods at this 
juncture 
means to take samples. This is an inequitable attitude ignoring 
our present unique status which excludes ad hoc inspection, and 
a prejudiced, unreasonable demand blindly casting "suspicion" on 
the DPRK. 
  We have already clearly notified the IAEA that we will 
contain all the spent fuel under strict surveillance of the IAEA 
and fully allow the IAEA to measure it when the nuclear issue is 
settled between the DPRK and the USA. 
  It is hardly understandable for the IAEA Secretariat to 
insist on selecting and preserving some of the fuel now, though 
it will be able to get the most correct results if it measures 
all the fuel at that time. 
  This makes us suspect that the IAEA Secretariat is not 
interested in the measurement of the fuel rods but is seeking 
the political purpose of gradually undermining our unique status 
under the cloak of measurement. 
  In its report on the results of the inspection in March at 
the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the United Nations 
Security Council, the Secretariat said it was "indispensable" to 
wind up the "incomplete inspection activities" at the 
radiochemical laboratory. So, we allowed them and now the 
Secretariat says it is "indispensable" to select and preserve 
fuel rods. This proves that there is no credibility in the 
attitude of the Secretariat. 
  This makes us conclude that the Secretariat's demand for 
selecting and preserving fuel rods at this juncture is aimed at 
fabricating another "inconsistency" which was one of the root 
causes of our withdrawal from the NPT and justifying its 
partiality toward the DPRK. 
  In view of our unique status, we are only obliged to provide 
the continuity of safeguards through the verification of the 
non- diversion of nuclear material, not the verification of the 
completeness and correctness of the initial inventory. 
  Though we decided to strictly contain the fuel rods and put 
them under the control of the agency, some quarters of the 
United States are now spreading the rumor that we are changing 
the fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of 
four or five nuclear bombs. This is quite contradictory to the 
fact and cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention 
to intensify pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of refueling. 
  Actually, refueling is taking place under the watch of the 
cameras installed by the agency. So, there is no ground to 
worry about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another 
purpose. 
  Now some quarters are contending that if we stopped and put 
off refueling, the problem of observation might be solved. This 
is, however, an unrealistic speculation that does not take into 
account the characteristics of the technical safety of our 
experimental atomic power plant. 
  If refueling is stopped midway, it may cause a new danger in 
the view of safety. 
  But we think that since refueling has just begun, there 
still 
remain possibilities to resolve the problem. 
  We proposed to the agency negotiations for an agreement on 
practical matters related to the presence at the replacement of 
fuel rods along with complicated outstanding issues with it. 
  The solution to the issue depends on the attitude of the 
agency. 
  If the agency persist in its unreasonable demand, ignoring 
our unavoidable conditions regarding the replacement of the fuel 
rods, the issue would become more complicated. 
  We will as ever make every possible effort for a fair and 
fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.

  Sun, the former president of National Taiwan University, 
told 
the legislative chamber that of the missiles currently available 
in the world, only the Patriot is capable of intercepting 
missiles. 
  He said Taiwan would purchase the Patriot model known as the 
PAC- II, a revised model of the one that functioned effectively 
against Scud missiles fired by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. 
  Sun said negotiations for the arms sale have been under way 
for some time, and are almost complete. Yet he did not reveal 
the value of the arms sale. 
  Sun also told the legislature that the first squadron of 
locally manufactured Ching Kuo jet fighters, better known as 
"Indigenous Defensive Fighters," will be commissioned before the 
end of the year. They will be equipped with Tien Chien, or "Sky 
Sword" air-to- air missiles, he said. 
  The air force is scheduled to acquire 120 of the combat 
aircraft. Taiwan has also contracted to buy 150 us-made F-16s 
and 60 French Mirage 2000-5s. 
  The army also has completed the deployment of the first 
battery of Tien Kung ground-to-air missiles, Sun said. Dubbed 
"Sky Bows," the missiles were developed by the Chung-shan 
Institute of Science and Technology.

<F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener and Luiz Antonio Novaes] </F>
  [Text] The Brazilian Government is ready to undertake a 
prickly mission: convincing the White House that Brazil's space 
program is completely peaceful. In other words, that our 
satellite launch rockets will neither don military uniforms nor 
transform themselves into missiles capable of landing in our 
neighbors' territories. In February, the government announced it 
would adhere to the terms of the MCTR [acronym as published] 
[Missile Technology Control Regime - MTCR] an international 
treaty that restricts missile production. And the new Brazilian 
Space Agency (a sort of green-and-yellow NASA), which acquired 
its first directors in early March, is likely to permanently 
disconnect the program from any military content, in the eyes of 
the Americans. Until February, when the agency was created, the 
Brazilian Commission for Space Activities (COBAE), linked to the 
Armed Forces General Staff, was responsible for this project. 
The oaths taken as to the peaceful nature of our space program 
will probably also appear on the menu at the meetings that U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore will hold in Brasilia this week. Major 
General Ajax Barros de Melo, 59, the new director general of the 
space agency, confirmed the overtures to the United States, 
saying: "We want to make it plain that we really never had 
military objectives." The United States acknowledges the 
blandishments: "The creation of the civilian agency puts 
relations between the two countries back on track," commented an 
American diplomat. 
  There is a clear motive behind these Brazilian signs of good 
will: a relaxation of the veritable blockade the White House has 
been imposing on Brazil's space mission. Since the United States 
suspects that a parallel missile program exists, it has always 
done everything possible to keep Brazil from accessing the most 
sensitive technology. One American diplomat told ISTOE that his 
government went so far as to prohibit the presentation of 
certain books to Brazilian scientists. A study that the White 
House commissioned in 1993 from the Rand Corporation, an 
ultraconservative research institution, concluded that the 
Brazilian space program is "not economically viable." Unless its 
true objective were the production of missiles. The skirmishes 
between the two countries peaked at the end of last year, when 
Brazil accelerated its participation in a joint program with 
China for the launching of two observation satellites. At the 
time, the military command signalled that Brazil might attempt 
to obtain, from the Chinese and Russians, the special technology 
denied it by the United States and its allies. 
  The Brazilian space program calls for the launching of four 
communications satellites. The first two in the Brasilsat series 
are already in orbit. It is expected that another will take off 
in 1995, mounted on the nose of a Brazilian satellite launch 
vehicle (SLV). The Sino-Brazilian project, in turn, includes the 
launching of two observation satellites, the first in 1996. "Our 
space mission has not only created about 5,000 highly 
specialized jobs, it transferred First World technology to 
different sectors of civilian industry," said Marcio Barbosa, 
director of the National Institute of Space Research (INPE) in 
Sao Jose dos Campos (SP). One of the examples of this 
technological transfer occurred at the Esca company, of Barueri 
(SP), which is involved in the Sino-Brazilian satellites 
project. Esca used the aerospace know-how to develop cheaper 
plastic bottles for soft drinks. 
  Even with all the guarantees offered the United States as to 
the civilian objective of the space mission, there is little 
possibility that the Brazilian project will get a powerful 
injection of the latest technology in the near future. "I do not 
think our potential partners will help us build the SLV," Ajax 
de Melo said. "We will have to do it right here." And even if it 
has "adhered to the conditions" of the missiles limitation 
agreement, there are still doubts that Brazil will actually sign 
the document, an action that would make the White House more 
tractable. "There will be no formal signature. We are adults and 
we will do what Russia and China did, which is simply to declare 
that we will adhere to the terms of the agreement," the general 
explained. After enduring spartan budgets when Fernando Collor 
was president, the SLV is supposed to get US$40 million from the 
government between now and 1995. And its development may yet 
provoke new frictions with the Americans. After all, as Ajax de 
Melo noted,"if you build a rocket and put it into orbit, you can 
aim it anywhere you want. We have that capability and the 
Americans know it. That is what sovereignty is," the officer 
concluded.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Avoiding a missile race"] </F>
  [Text] A spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office has 
expressed concern over the Indian decision to deploy Prithvi and 
Agni missiles on the grounds that it will greatly enhance the 
possibility of a nuclear arms race in the region. While 
Pakistan in the context of its security environment is more 
concerned with the short range Prithvi missile, it is the 
Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) Agni, that has a 
range of 2500 km and can carry a heavy payload, which, to an 
even greater extent, underlines India's aggressive defence 
posture. A missile of this type, in the presence of a high 
degree of accuracy, is significant not least because of its 
ability to carry nuclear warheads over a long range. This has 
caused even countries well beyond the region to question India's 
intentions. However, given the unfortunate history of conflict 
between India and Pakistan, the latter has felt more compelled 
to take defensive measures with regard to India's ambitious 
missile programme. Apart from attempting to develop indigenous 
missile technology to the best of its ability, Pakistan has 
incurred a small number of M-11 missiles from China. It has 
argued in response to US pressure on this score that the 
acquisition of these missiles does not violate the Missile 
Technology Control Regime (MTCRL). However, the real issue here 
is that if Pakistan perceives a major threat to its security as 
a result of the imminent deployment of the Prithvi missile, it 
is bound to take steps that provide it with the minimum 
necessary level of deterrence. 
  The matter is further aggravated when India's activities in 
this realm are seen in tandem with its ambitious and secretive 
nuclear programme. It is in this context that the Foreign 
Office spokesman has expressed legitimate fears. It is time for 
India to consider the cost of a prohibitively explosive race in 
the realm of missiles and nuclear weapons for the extremely 
deprived masses of the region. Neither country can really afford 
to enter into such a race. Certainly, Pakistan is already having 
to spend far too much on defence primarily because of India's 
continual enhancement of its already formidable defence 
capability as well as its aggressive stance, not just towards 
Pakistan, but the countries of the region, in general. Finding 
a solution to the nuclear issue in South Asia remains a 
difficult task not least as a result of India's intransigence in 
this regard. But, meanwhile, it would be eminently sensible if 
a beginning could be made on the missile front. If India were 
to restrain the production and deployment of missiles, it would 
contribute in bringing down the level of tension between the two 
countries and score an important confidence building measure 
that could possibly pave the way for progress on the more 
complex nuclear issue. Perhaps US policy-makers could take up 
the matter with the Indian prime minister on his upcoming visit 
to the United States. It would be even better, of course, if 
India were willing to make the issue a subject of meaningful 
bilateral negotiations with Pakistan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mohammad Yamin] </F>
  [Text] India's decision to deploy long-range nuclear 
missiles -- Prithvi and Agni -- has caused understandable 
concern to Pakistan. The Indian move will greatly enhance the 
threat to peace and security in South Asia and as a spokesman of 
Pakistan's Foreign Office observed the other day, it will raise 
the specter of a nuclear arms race in the region. In view of 
the ongoing internal uprising held in Kashmir and the unresolved 
dispute between India and Pakistan over the future status of 
Jammu and Kashmir, and also the historical fact that there have 
been three major armed conflicts between the two countries since 
their independence, Pakistan will be the most likely target of 
India's newly acquired military muscle. In long term, of course, 
there will be other countries who would also have to face up to 
the reality of life when India decides to flex its muscle in 
pursuance of its hegemonic designs in the region and its 
ambition of becoming a regional superpower. 
  Pakistan has, therefore, conveyed its concern over the 
matter 
to the Missile Technology Control Regime, MTCR, countries that 
include, among others, the United States. Hopefully, the MTCR 
nations would respond positively to Pakistan's message and 
exercise their collective and individual influence over India to 
give up dabbling in nuclear missilery and other weaponry of mass 
destruction. 
  Given India's intransigence over the issue, or for that 
matter over any bilateral or multilateral issues throughout 47 
years of its existence as an independent nation, the pursuance 
of Pakistani request by the MTCR countries is going to be a 
formidable task. The Indian prime minister has given a fair 
proof of it. Addressing the Indian Parliament on the eve of his 
departure for the United States on an official visit, Mr. 
Narasimha Rao chose to rule out the possibility that he might 
agree to roll back India's nuclear or missile program during his 
U.S. trip. In fact, his decision for any such suggestion was 
forceful and vehement and he remarked that a leader would be 
worthless if he changed the policies of his government during 
visits to foreign countries. He reiterated that his government 
would firmly adhere to its nuclear and missile development 
policies. (?While) on one hand, India is pressing ahead with 
its militaristic designs and augmentation of its military might 
at a hectic pace, on the other hand, it is [word indistinct] 
upon its own brand of disinformation and spread of false 
propaganda against Pakistan. To blame the revolt of Kashmiri 
people against the Indian occupation on Pakistan is easy enough. 
It now holds Pakistan responsible for trouble even inside its 
northeastern states that are over a thousand mile distance from 
Pakistan. It is also engaged in repeating the wild stories of 
Pakistan's complicity in last year's bomb blasts in Bombay. 
Along with its diplomatic and publicity offensive, India is 
also busy in acts of sabotage and mischief in liberated areas of 
Kashmir. It is also indulging in violations of the airspace of 
Azad Kashmir. Several Indian military helicopters flew along 
the Line of Control on 5 May and on two occasions, they crossed 
over into Azad Kashmir, besides two Indian terrorists were 
apprehended recently in Kotli sector of Azad Kashmir. They were 
carrying 52 kg of explosives and had confessed that they were on 
a sabotage mission at the behest of the Indian authorities. All 
these have ominous forebodings for peace and tranquillity in 
South Asia, particularly the deployment of Agni and Prithvi 
missiles must be seen as an important landmark in India's 
nuclear capability and a clear adoption of a threatening posture 
against small neighbors, Pakistan being on the top of the list.

  [Text] Karachi (APP) -- Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Saeed 
M. Khan said here on Sunday that India's hegemonic aspirations 
can only spell trouble for smaller states in the region. 
  Addressing student-officers of PN [Pakistan Navy] Staff 
College here, Admiral Saeed said India's interest in seeking 
naval cooperation with regional countries is aimed at allaying 
regional apprehension about its naval buildup on the one hand 
and isolating Pakistan in the region, on the other. 
  India is also trying to portray China as an "external" 
adversary to justify its naval expansion, now that it has 
retracted its opposition to U.S. presence, he said. 
  The Naval Chief further said that Indian Navy is reportedly 
working on a programme for development of nuclear propulsion 
capability. Seen in the context of its nuclear capability and a 
comprehensive ballistic missiles programme this is ominous 
having profound and far-reaching implications for the entire 
region Admiral Saeed said. 
  He said, with the stoppage of U.S. aid in 1990, the Pakistan 
Navy received a major setback when three PNC Orion Aircraft, 
which had been cleared for release, were withheld. Later, the 
U.S. also insisted on the return of eight warships on expiry of 
their lease, Admiral Saeed added. He further said, despite all 
difficulties the country was on way to building a fairly modern 
and balanced fleet of a reasonable size. 
  Admiral Saeed said, the recently acquired type 21 Frigates 
after being updated, would adequately fill the gap created by 
the return of American ships. Pakistan Navy's submarines fitted 
with Harpoon Missiles can deliver powerful punch, but their 
numerical strength is below the required level. 
  About mine hunters, the Admiral said, Pakistan Navy's 
deficiency in mine countermeasures capability has been made up 
by the purchase of three modern mine hunters. 
  He said that in the present strategic scenario and in the 
face of continuing Indian naval expansion there is no choice but 
to consolidate our navy through self-reliance. He added, a long 
term programme has been placed before the government for 
building a series of surface ships at the Karachi Shipyard and 
Engineering Works (KSEW) in collaboration with a foreign Yard. 
Admiral Saeed said, this would be a major step forward which 
would also catalyses [as published] development in various 
industries in the country. 
  The Naval Chief said that the next few years are going to be 
crucial and to tax all our resources-financial, material and 
personnel. He added, if managed and harnessed well these 
resources will give the country the much needed maritime defence 
capability. 
  On his arrival earlier at the PN Staff College, Naval Chief 
Admiral Saeed M. Khan was received by the College Commandant, 
Commodore Serfraz Khan. 
  Flag Officers and other senior naval officers were also 
present on the occasion.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Unkindled Agni"] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister's denial in Parliament that the 
Agni missile programme was being shelved under American pressure 
will only partially remove public misgivings on this score. 
Indeed, Mr Narasimha Rao's remark that "there is no pressure 
from the United States (and) hence there is no question of 
yielding to it" is unlikely to satisfy everyone, considering 
that the Americans have made no secret of their deep displeasure 
with India's experiments with rocket technology and have been 
trying their best, including compelling Russia to renege on the 
cryogenic deal, to force India to abandon its various projects. 
The U.S. pressure has been there even before the time of the 
first launch of the Agni in 1989 when India claimed success in 
joining an exclusive club of the Big Five and Israel by 
mastering the intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) 
technology. What has led to the renewed speculation about 
American intentions is obviously the fact that the reports about 
the capping of the Agni programme have followed close on the 
heels of the Strobe Talbott visit during which the Americans 
tried to persuade India to join a regional nuclear disarmament 
conference which carries the threat of imposing restrictions on 
various technological experiments. It would have been better, 
therefore, for the government to be more explicit about the Agni 
project during the Rajya Sabha debate. 
  The observation of the minister of state for defence, Mr M. 
Mallikarjun, that the flight of the Agni "was only a technology 
demonstration" and that it was "yet to be decided whether it 
should be converted into a missile programme" was no more than a 
reiteration of what is known. In the present context, the 
government might have clarified whether it would persist with 
the experiments. This is all the more necessary because the 
third test-firing of the Agni last February was also described 
as the final launch which had reportedly met all the 
requirements of the objectives set for the mission. As Dr Abdul 
Kalam, director-general of the Defence Research and Development 
Organisation, said, "so far as technology is concerned, we have 
demonstrated our capability" and it was now "for the government 
to take a political decision for its induction in the armed 
forces." According to some reports, the government is 
considering three options: to develop Agni as a weapon of war or 
to continue perfecting the IRBM technology but not using 
warheads as evidence of India's peaceful intentions, or to drop 
the programme altogether. Given the conditions in India's 
immediate neighbourhood, there is no question of opting for the 
third alternative, but whatever the government's decision, it 
must be seen to have been taken purely on merit and not under 
any compulsion.

  [Text] New Delhi, Mar. 18 (PTI)--A standing parliamentary 
committee on energy today said that India has "not isolated" 
itself from the other nuclear countries of the world, though it 
remains a non-signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
(NPT). 
  In its fourth report on nuclear plant safety and spent fuel 
management, tabled in Parliament today by its chairman Mr 
Jaswant Singh, the committee said that despite the imposition of 
technology control regimes in force, India holds the status of a 
developed country in the field of nuclear science and technology. 
  Besides, India's willingness to share its experience with 
others bears testimony to the transparency programmes, even as 
India often keeps reminding members of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) that promotion of peaceful applications of 
atomic energy is its primary goal. 
  The committee finds that India enjoys international 
reputation as a `developed' country in the field of nuclear 
science and technology. Safety standards in Indian nuclear 
reactors follow global standards and their safety is constantly 
monitored by the atomic energy regulatory board (AERB) which 
observes current international regulatory norms, it said. 
  Stating that India continues to be playing a prominent role 
among the nuclear community inspite of not signing NPT, the 
committee said units of the department of atomic energy (DAE) 
hold dynamic links with some of the leading professional 
international organisations dealing with peaceful applications 
of nuclear energy. 
  The committee said India has been a member of the board of 
governors of the IAEA since its inception and was one of the ten 
members considered `most advanced' in the technology of atomic 
energy in the world and therefore got nominated to the board 
every year along with other countries such as the United States, 
UK, France, Russia, China, Japan, Germany, Canada, Brazil and 
Argentina. 
  Referring to the country's nuclear power programme, the 
committee said that the entire process of nuclear power plant 
design, construction, commissioning and operation is covered by 
a systematic quality assurance programme to provide assurances 
about meeting of all safety requirements. 
  It said India's long-term nuclear power programmes is a 
three-stage one and the first stage is based on pressurised 
heavy water reactors (PHWRS) using indigenously available 
natural uranium as fuel. It said indigenous natural uranium fuel 
resources would sustain a nuclear power programme of 10,000 MWE 
in the first stage. 
  The second stage of the programme is based on fast breeder 
reactors (FRRS) using plutonium as fuel reprocessed from the 
spent fuel of the first stage. In this stage, with blanket 
material of depleted uranium, more plutonium would be bred to 
set up additional FRBS. Also at a later part of the second stage 
thorium as blanket material would breed U-233 from thorium, the 
committee said. 
  In the third stage, the programme is based on U-233 
thorium-based reactor systems by which U-233 could be bred to 
set up a number of reactors. 
  The committee said that the first stage programme is not an 
end in itself but a route to the second stage programme of FBRS 
and is ultimately aimed at utilising the thorium resources. 
  It said India has moderate reserves of uranium whereas 
thorium reserves are vast. Under the circumstances and if a 
long-term view of energy resources is taken, it is imporant to 
push through PHWR programmes at a fast pace. 
  The committee has also found that for funding of nuclear 
power, there are no avenues for resources from overseas 
financial institutions, unlike in the conventional power sector.

  [Text] Hyderabad, April 5--The Nuclear Fuel Complex near 
here, which is solely responsible for supplying fuel bundles and 
in-core structural components to India's nuclear power reactors, 
is embarking on a big expansion and diversification programme, 
reports UNI. 
  More than half of the Rs 355-crore programme, including 
construction of new plants on the sprawling 500-hectare NFC 
[Nuclear Fuel Complex] campus at Moula Ali near here, has been 
completed. 
  With the commissioning of the new plants, the annual 
production of fuel bundles would be doubled to 32,000 annually 
by the end of 1995, the NFC chief executive, Mr K.K. Sinha, said. 
  The NFC now produces 16,400 fuel bundles--the most critical 
components of reactors--besides zirconium alloy mill products. 
It supplies to the country's nine operating nuclear power 
plants, including two each at Tarapur, Narora, Kalpakkam and 
Kota and one at Kakrapara.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 13 -- The Prime Minister said today 
that any suggestion to restrict India's nuclear option would be 
"unacceptable and unrealistic," in view of Pakistan's nuclear 
weapons capability and the recent proliferation of such weapons. 
  In an address at the opening session of the Army Commanders' 
Conference here, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao said that 
non-proliferation measures must be universal and 
non-discriminate and should include a specific time-frame. 
  This statement to senior Defence personnel assumes 
significance in the context of the U.S. pressure on India to 
sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
  Mr Rao said that India had always advocated peaceful use of 
nuclear energy and continued to believe that non-proliferation 
measures should not be selective in their application. 
  Speaking on allegations of human rights violations, the 
Prime 
Minister said that India's concern for the maintenance of human 
rights was second to none. 
  He claimed that those who tried to extract capital out of 
this issue should cease what he called their futile attempts to 
malign Indian security forces. 
  "It would amount to an insult to the concept of human rights 
to distort and misuse it for political exploitation and 
slanderous propaganda," he said. He added that of late, there 
had been a better understanding of India's performance and that 
some success had been attained in dispelling the motivated 
campaign against the forces. 
  The Pakistan-sponsored low intensity conflict in Kashmir was 
a major challenge to the nation, Mr Rao said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Option"] </F>
  [Text] The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao, has done well 
to reiterate India's policy on nuclear proliferation and 
emphasise that, while India is for a universal and comprehensive 
disarmament, suggestions to restrict India's own nuclear options 
are unacceptable and unrealistic in the current world and 
regional context. Given the recent visit of the U.S. deputy 
secretary of state, Mr Strove Talbott, to New Delhi and 
Islamabad in pursuit of America's declared aim of "capping, 
reducing and eventually eliminating" nuclear weapons and 
ballistic missiles in South Asia, it was important for the Prime 
Minister to tell an assembly of army commanders that India's 
policy would not change. Since 1988, this policy has had a 
specific framework in the form of the action plan by the year 
2010 presented by Rajiv Gandhi to the United Nations session on 
disarmament. Under it, the onus for ending the nuclear arms race 
rests squarely on the shoulders of the big powers, and its 
centrepiece is an international treaty to replace the NPT 
[Nonproliferation Treaty], which will see the complete 
elimination of nuclear weapons by the year 2010. Things have not 
quite moved the way Rajiv Gandhi anticipated even after the end 
of the cold war and the partial elimination of the fears of a 
nuclear holocaust. Not only have the nuclear weapons states 
remained silent on the subject of the universal elimination of 
nuclear weapons, Britain, France and China have taken no 
concrete steps to join the `big two' in reducing their nuclear 
weapons. 
  On the other hand, countries like India have come under 
pressure to take steps to reassure the world that they will not 
make nuclear weapons, despite India's proven track record of 
responsible behaviour in this area. For this very reason, Mr 
Rao's observations are important. When the subject is nuclear 
proliferation, there is in any case great need for precision, 
especially because India's known position on the issue is one of 
carefully cultivated ambiguity. In this context, Mr Atal Behari 
Vajpayee may not be wrong in pointing out that India's stand on 
nuclear issues is not related to Pakistan alone, but he is 
perhaps reading too much into the Prime Minister's statement as 
reported in the media. A closer reading of the official release 
makes it clear that Mr Rao had in mind a wider context, 
including areas other than Pakistan where such weapons could be 
found. The Prime Minister cannot but be aware of the strong 
feelings that the subject arouses in the country, especially 
since India has chosen the responsible policy of merely 
retaining, but not exercising, the nuclear option. Unlike other 
countries which depend on alliances for their security, India is 
a self-professedly non-aligned country which must ensure its own 
in a world or a region which is not entirely peaceful.

<F P=106> [By Ranjit Kumar] </F>
  [Text] India has achieved remarkable success in the 
production of high-quality fuel used in nuclear power plants. 
Due to its success in this field, India will no longer be 
dependent on the developed countries regarding nuclear energy. 
This has enabled India to joint a select band of countries. 
India has successfully tried mixed uranium oxide as fuel for 
the Tarapur atomic power plant. It is worth mentioning that the 
United States refused to supply fuel for this plant and later 
prevented France from supplying fuel as well. The reason given 
was that India has not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty. Indian scientists, however, have now developed an 
alternative to the U.S. fuel enriched uranium. Now India is 
ready to use the indigenously developed fuel at Tarapur. 
  India has produced mixed uranium oxide fuel at the Advance 
Fuel Fabrication Center. A laboratory has also been set up to 
maintain the quality of mixed uranium oxide fuel. A plan has 
been prepared for plutonium reprocessing at the 200-megawatt 
pressurized heavy water reactor in Trombay. All practical 
aspects regarding the use of the alternative mixed uranium oxide 
as a fuel at Tarapur have been studied. Thus, in the nuclear 
power program, India has not only joined a select band of 
countries on the strength of its research, but additional 
successes achieved in the field of fuel fabrication has made it 
a world leader in some respects. 
  According to the annual report of the Department of Atomic 
Energy, India is successfully running the fast breeder test 
reactor at Kalpakkam. This marks the beginning of the second 
phase of the Indian nuclear energy program. The fuel fabricated 
for this fast breeder reactor is known as mixed 
uranium-plutonium carbide. The fuel is the total result of 
Indian efforts. This is the first time this fuel has been used 
in a fast breeder reactor. The Department of Atomic Energy is 
now preparing a blueprint for a 500-megawatt fast breeder test 
reactor using mixed uranium-plutonium carbide as a fuel. 
  India is now set to enter the ambitious third phase of its 
nuclear energy program. Under the third phase, fuel based on 
uranium-233 has been successfully fabricated. Encouraged by 
this success the Department of Atomic Energy has started working 
on the advanced heavy water reactor. This heavy water reactor 
will use thorium as fuel. The Kalpakkam fast breeder test 
reactor using indigenously fabricated carbide fuel has produced 
10.25 megawatt of electricity on trial basis. The research and 
development work at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center keeps in 
view the future needs of the country's nuclear energy program. 
The outcome of the center's research has greatly boosted hopes 
of increasing nuclear power production. The Bhabha research 
program includes development of the 500-megawatt pressurized 
heavy water reactor and thorium- based reactor. The fabrication 
of fuel at the nuclear power plants itself is considered as a 
significant success in the direction of producing power from 
nuclear energy. This step will help India achieve a credible 
self-reliance in the field of nuclear energy. India can now 
escape from the pressures like the one applied by the United 
States for signing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in return 
for the fuel for Tarapur.

  [Text] New Delhi -- An overwhelming majority of the 
Capital's residents believes that the USA is pro-Pakistan, that 
Washington is fuelling an arms race on the sub-continent, and 
that India should make the nuclear bomb. 
  These are some of the findings of an opinion poll conducted 
over Tuesday and Wednesday among informed, regular readers of 
newspapers in New Delhi by MRAS-Burke on behalf of THE PIONEER. 
  Asked whether in their view the USA is pro-Pakistan, 
pro-India or neutral, a whopping 91 per cent of the respondents 
declared that America is pro-Pakistan. More men than women feel 
strongly about this. An insignificant three per cent of the 
respondents said that the USA is pro-lndia and an equally small 
number, four per cent, said that it is neutral. 
  More than four-fifths of the respondents, 84 per cent, said 
that India should go ahead and make the nuclear bomb. The number 
of people opposed to the bomb is just above a tenth of the 
respondents. Once again, a greater proportion of men (88 per 
cent) want the bomb, compared to women (74 per cent). 
  The poll also shows that 85 per cent of the respondents 
believe that America is fuelling an arms race on the 
sub-continent by supplying Pakistan with the F-16 air craft. 
Those who differ with this view comprise a minuscule 11 per cent. 
  As for America's attempts to force India into abandoning its 
missile programme, 82 per cent of the respondents said that New 
Delhi should stand up and oppose Washington. Less than a fifth 
of them felt that India should give in to American pressure. 
  While the majority of the respondents felt that India was 
standing up to American pressures on nuclear and Kashmir related 
issues, they were not that sure about New Delhi resisting 
Washington's line on economic affairs. 
  For instance, while 64 per cent of the respondents said that 
India was standing up to America on nuclear issues, less than 50 
per cent were willing to say the same about economic affairs. In 
fact as many as 45 per cent of the respondents felt that India 
has not resisted American pressures on the economic front. 
  The support for the Government's stand on Kashmir vis-a-vis 
American pressure is less than that for its stand on nuclear 
issues. While 58 per cent of the respondents said that New Delhi 
has resisted Washington's pressure tactics on Kashmir more than 
a third rejected this view. 
  Interestingly. the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State. Ms 
Robin Raphel's comments on Kashmir are seen as the single 
biggest contributor towards upsetting Indo-American relations. 
Next on the list is the U.S.-inspired dispute over India's 
missile programme. followed by America's attempt to arm-twist 
India at the secret London talks. 
  But despite their view that America is pro-Pakistan, that it 
is fuelling an arms race on the subcontinent and that India 
should resist all pressures and make the nuclear bomb, a vast 
majority or the respondents said that Prime Minister P V 
Narasimha Rao should visit the U.S. 
  Mr Narasimha Rao's upcoming visit was endorsed by as many as 
81 per cent of the respondents, compared to 17 per cent who said 
that he should abandon the trip. Interestingly, more women (88 
per cent) endorsed the visit than men (77 per cent). 
  These findings are based on personal interviews with 307 men 
and women conducted in office complexes and residential areas, 
ensuring geographical spread. It was also ensured that the 
respondents have a monthly household income of more than Rs 
[rupees] 2,000 and read newspapers at least five days a week. 
Quotas were maintained for age, sex and income to represent all 
categories of people in the Capital.

<F P=106> [Article by Jasjit Singh: "South Asian Nuclear Scene; Time </F>
for Local Initiative"] 
  [Text] The issue of multilateral dialogue on security (or 
non-proliferation, as the United States may prefer) 
unfortunately seems to have been compounded by the U.S. attempts 
to hustling India, especially by the London talks. It is all the 
more unfortunate because this has happened just before the Prime 
Minister's visit to the United States. But there is a need to 
take a dispassionate view of the questions involved. 
  The United States has been seeking a multilateral dialogue 
since 1991 to discuss non-proliferation in South Asia. Our 
problem has been that the South Asian framework simply does not 
address the problems of nuclear security in our case. But the 
five-nation dialogue was doomed from the day Pakistan 
arbitrarily derailed the process by defining the agenda in terms 
of seeking to establish South Asia as a nuclear weapon-free 
zone. U.S. insistence since then to hold a five-nation dialogue 
has only tended to harden attitudes in India against any 
multilateral dialogue on non-proliferation issues. 
  The United States has been clearly articulating its 
non-proliferation objectives: it seeks to cap, reduce and 
eliminate nuclear capabilities in South Asia--in other words, 
create a nuclear weapon-free zone. This is the reason why even 
later variations of the five-nation dialogue continue to be 
deeply suspect in Indian eyes. The United States has been saying 
that it has no fixed agenda, but the picture at the end of the 
road has been clearly defined. It claims that the composition 
could be decided through preparatory discussions, but it seems 
to have strong reservations about a composition that does not 
stack up in favour of its goals. And the greater the U.S. 
pressure, the greater the Indian resistance not to give in, 
especially when the fundamental and vital national strategic 
interests of India are at stake. 
<H5>  Basic Goals </H5>
  It is ironic that the basic goals of the two countries lie 
along parallel lines, displaced in time and scope. Our vital 
interests can be addressed only by a non-proliferation policy 
that seeks the elimination of nuclear weapons from the world, 
while the United States wants to apply disarmament only to South 
Asia. We have believed that the process could be preceded by 
nuclear freeze and reduction in a global framework; and that 
this cannot be achieved in a local framework. The problem is 
that the U.S. aims regarding nonproliferation in South Asia, and 
our vital strategic interests have become increasingly 
irreconcilable. 
  The bilateral dialogues were meant to improve mutual 
understanding of strategic concerns. Some common ground has been 
found in terms of starting negotiations for a global ban on 
production of fissile material for weapon purposes, and more can 
be found in working for the comprehensive test-ban treaty. These 
are important building blocks for the long-term goals. But these 
should not be jeopardised by narrow partisan aims. The question 
remains whether there is any scope for a multilateral dialogue. 
To answer this we must look at the realities dispassionately. 
  The very term `cap' assumes that the United States considers 
the situation in South Asia as that representing a 
post-proliferation stage. Its willingness to waive its own laws 
against clandestine weapon programmes only confirms that it 
accepts Pakistan's nuclear weapon status. It is, therefore, in 
the interest of Indians and Pakistanis, more than anyone else, 
to reduce the risks associated with ambiguous nuclear 
capabilities. This indeed is the rationale for the Indian 
proposals to Pakistan for no-first-use of nuclear capabilities, 
non-attack on population centres. 
<H5>  More Steps </H5>
  Many more steps down that road are possible if Pakistan is 
willing to seek greater stability and reduced risks. The United 
States prepared its own policies on seeking strategic stability, 
and could contribute constructively by agreeing to multilateral 
agreements that aim for strategic stability in Southern Asia. 
People like Mr Paul Nitze are arguing about the lack of utility 
and futility of U.S. nuclear responses in future scenarios. 
Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) have their 
greatest potential in a bilateral framework, but they also lend 
themselves to multilateral discussions and agreements, and would 
go a long way in achieving perhaps more than arms control 
measures because they circumscribe the nuclear factors. There 
are greater payoffs in a multilateral dialogue on peace, 
co-operation and security, rather than starting with 
non-proliferation measures on the agenda in a post-proliferation 
world. At the same time, the framework will have to be Asian 
rather than that of South Asia. 
  We need to be sensitive to the intrinsic risks associated 
with ambiguous nuclear weapon programmes; and hence the need for 
seeking stability. The scope for bilateral dialogue with 
Pakistan on nuclear issues is limited to CSBMs only, and going 
beyond that would be counter-productive, besides according 
legitimacy to a clandestine programme. The Pakistani leadership 
has already been emphasising that its nuclear programme is 
capped/frozen at 1989-90 level. This is credible since no real 
advantage would accrue to Pakistan in going beyond the dozen or 
so weapon capability it has acquired; and the additional costs 
would be infructuous. 
  For India, keeping the nuclear option open in a recessed 
deterrence posture is adequate. Even in the worse case scenario, 
the maximum capability that India would ever need is that of 
minimum deterrence. There is, thus, virtually no risk of an 
open-ended nuclear arms race in the sub-continent. As regards 
the uncertainty about who has the finger on the nuclear button 
in Pakistan, General Aslam Beg has recently confirmed that a 
national command authority for nuclear deterrence exists. 
<H5>  Capping Strategy </H5>
  The other risk is that of nuclear weapon technology being 
passed on to another state by Pakistan. This problem cannot be 
resolved by the capping strategy. On the other hand, 
notwithstanding irresponsible and fictional accounts (like 
Critical Mass), it would be difficult to argue that 
the present situation is unstable as long as Pakistanis believe 
that their nuclear weapons provide them a much-needed sense of 
security. 
  At the same time, there is a need for strengthening regional 
peace and security. This can be enhanced by a multilateral 
dialogue in an Asian forum for peace. Kazakhstan has already 
proposed a conference on confidence-building and peace in Asia, 
and China has supported the idea. Iran has been emphasising the 
need for regional solutions through regional co-operation. The 
time is, therefore, ripe for providing the necessary impetus to 
a multilateral dialogue among the states of Asia on peace and 
co-operation to translate the concept of Panchsheel 
into a new co-operative security framework under the principle 
of "mutual and equal security." 
  Such a multilateral dialogue need not be a substitute for, 
or 
in contradiction of, any multilateral dialogue sought by the 
United States. But it would complement the fundamental goal of 
seeking an improved environment through better political 
relations and marginalise a nuclear weapon-based approach to 
inter-state relations and national security. The United States 
would need to re-think its policy approaches, especially with 
regard to what it seeks in a multilateral dialogue. 
Non-proliferation, like disarmament, is the means to the larger 
end of ensuring peace and security; and it should not be 
interpreted as an end in itself and sought for its own sake.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "New Dimension to India's Security"] </F>
  [Text] While it is comforting that the position of the 
United Kingdom on the Kashmir issue is not far from India's, the 
continued double-speak on the part of the United States of 
America cannot but cause serious concern because of the 
ingredient of interference in our affairs. On top of its 
departure from the already accepted position of Kashmir's 
accession to India, the Bill Clinton administration's move to 
make available to Pakistan 38 F-16 deep penetration strike 
aircraft (DPSA) provided Islamabad agrees to a nuclear `cap' or 
freeze through a so-called one-time exception to the Pressler 
amendment clearly shows its partisan posture. The Pressler Law 
bars economic and military aid since on its own assessment 
Islamabad possessed the nuclear bomb. It is common knowledge 
that the F-16 provides an effective delivery system for nuclear 
weapons. The External Affairs Minister, Mr Dinesh Singh's 
assessment that the United States is encouraging Pakistan to use 
nuclear weapons against this country should be regarded as a 
genuine concern for it adds a new dimension to the internal 
security of India. Pakistan already has 10 F-16s and was 
supposed to get 71 more when the Pressler sanctions were 
imposed. Eleven of the 71 aircraft were already built and paid 
for but Pakistan could not get them because of Pressler. Under 
the current proposal, if Pakistan `caps' its nuclear weapons 
programme it is possible that up to 38 aircraft could be made 
available. 
  The American postures and Pakistan's hectic activity 
internationally, with the main thrust on false propaganda to 
enlist sympathy of not only the Organisation of Islamic 
Countries but of other western nations on the ground that India 
had systematically violated human rights, should make New Delhi 
prepare for any eventuality. And this demands not only national 
discipline to brave the challenge, but all political parties 
should also once again demonstrate that they are one in the 
determination to thwart the designs of United States and 
Pakistan. There is a suspicion that America has designs to see 
that an independent Kashmir can be brought under its hegemony as 
part of its secret plan to control the region. While such a 
proposition is not only unacceptable to India it is also bound 
to be opposed by countries like China and Iran, not to speak of 
other Central Asian Republics. 
  The immediate consequence of the supply of F-16 aircraft to 
Pakistan is the upsetting of the security arrangements in India 
and it will be forced to beef up its defences, which may entail 
enormous expenditure to the point of dislocating our own 
developmental plans. This is one area where the nation cannot be 
complacent and the people should be prepared for any sacrifices 
that the situation demands. New Delhi would be well advised to 
match the mischief of Pakistan perpetrated by its Inter-Services 
Intelligence in a tit-for-tat manner rather than giving the 
impression that India is complaining from a position of 
weakness. By now it should be clear to the Indian Government 
that Pakistan understands only the language of offensive and not 
reason. Delhi should neither be apologetic nor go on the 
defensive but take effective steps to thwart Pakistan's evil 
designs, what with its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, 
becoming increasingly desperate, probably to save her political 
power, and the growing opposition to her internally including 
from her home province of Sind. The Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha 
Rao, had already hinted that his government would review or 
reassess its defence policy to face the Pakistani challenge. And 
that challenge can be met only by India going nuclear, 
notwithstanding pressures and threats from the United States and 
other western powers.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Shadow and Substance--India-U.S. </F>
Relations Today"] 
  [Excerpts] Indian-American relations seem to operate in 
Kondratiev cycles with an inevitableness which no amount of 
goodwill or diplomatic effort can influence. Even as there 
appear signals to suggest that the two are trying to repair the 
damage, that superlative fighter, the F-16, is once again set to 
send New Delhi's ties with Washington to a new low. 
  After a long winter of discontent, Indian and American 
relations were about to look up with the U.S. assistant 
secretary of state for South Asia, Ms Robin Raphel, whose 
remarks on the accession of Kashmir to India began the downward 
spiral, deciding to visit India to clear the air. Her trip, 
though not quite in the spirit of Henry going to Canossa, is 
being touted as part of an effort by the Clinton administration 
to restore the credibility of its South Asian policy. By 
engaging her Indian interlocutors, it is hoped that the bad 
feelings about her and her boss President Bill Clinton's remarks 
will be ended. 
<H5>  Sticks &amp; Stones </H5>
  So far New Delhi has comforted itself by the thought that 
words do not break bones. But it would now appear that 
Washington might be taking recourse to sticks and stones as 
well. The proposal for a "one-time" waiver of F-16 aircraft and 
other military equipment for Pakistan not only creates an 
enormous "public relations" problem for a government trying to 
keep its relations with Washington on an even keel, but will 
affect the military balance, thereby compelling a response in 
kind. An expenditure of $2 billion in the next two years in 
purchasing military hardware would almost certainly torpedo Dr 
Manmohan Singh's economic reform programme, if nothing else 
will. [passage omitted] 
  It is not clear why the United States expects India to sign 
on the dotted line. While it has on occasion dampened 
Indo-Pakistani tensions arising from the Kashmir problem, it has 
not shown itself to be a particularly impartial or even mature 
actor. Having resisted the Pakistani effort to internationalise 
the issue in Geneva, New Delhi cannot be expected to cave in and 
accept an international conference to resolve the dispute. Even 
if the Rao government was willing, it would find its room for 
action circumscribed by the Parliament resolution on Kashmir. 
<H5>  Short Memories </H5>
  Nor is it likely that the Rao government will be able to 
accept any new non-proliferation move being initiated by the 
Americans. Public memories tend to be short, but not short 
enough to forget that in the 1980s F-16s were supplied to check 
Pakistan's nuclear ambitions and when they failed to do so for 
three years American Presidents lied to Congress and the world 
by annually certifying that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear 
explosive device. In any case, capping will not take into 
account devices and fissile material that may have been produced 
since 1987, when, according to Mr A.Q. Khan and, more recently, 
the former Pakistani army chief, General Mirza Aslam Beg, 
Pakistan first made the bomb, and now. 
  There is little alternative for India but to engage the 
United States in a dialogue even while spelling out clearly that 
it will not undertake policies that fall below the threshold of 
India's national interests, be it in Kashmir or elsewhere. On 
non-proliferation, the Prime Minister has already outlined 
India's wider concerns about Russia and China. As soon as the 
proposed international convention to ban the production of 
fissile material for weapons comes into force, India will, as 
its leading supporter, accept inspections of its nuclear 
facilities. But in asking India to do so as part of the "F-16s 
for capping" agreement, Washington is asking it to bear the 
obligations while rewarding Islamabad. It was not India but U.S. 
law which blocked the aircraft from going to Pakistan. Asking 
New Delhi to pay the price for Washington's convoluted Pakistan 
policy is insulting, to say the least, and no embassy or 
high-level visit is likely to be able to convince anyone 
otherwise.

  [Text] Bangalore, March 31--The chairman of the Indian 
Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Prof U.R. Rao, yesterday 
said that India would be getting seven Russian cryogenic engines 
under the re-negotiated settlement and that the first engine 
would arrive in India by mid-1996 and after than an engine every 
six months. 
  Speaking to reporters on the eve of his laying down office, 
Prof Rao said under the settlement India would get four 
cryogenic engines, while using the `old option' ISRO would buy 
another three engines spending $3 million. 
  In addition to these seven engines, India would also get two 
mock stages, he said. 
  India and Russia had re-negotiated the Rs 340-crores project 
and Russia had agreed to supply seven engines in stages. ISRO 
had asked for an additional grant of Rs 250 crores for the 
project, he informed the reporters. 
  Denying that the Indian space programme had suffered a 
setback as the negotiations had run into rough weather following 
the United States' opposition to the transfer of technology, 
Prof Rao said the talks between the two countries concluded 
about two weeks ago and India would develop its own cryogenic 
engine. 
  Prof Rao said India had earlier ordered two engines and 
rounded off the agreement with a request for three more engines. 
The project needed seven engines including two mock ones. The 
deal was dropped in October. "We are moving on our own in the 
right direction," he said. 
  Stating that ISRO would like to see the Geosynchronous 
Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) operational at the earliest, 
Prof Rao said, the first GSLV using the Russian engine would be 
launched during 1996-97. 
  Prof Rao, however, denied that the scheduled visit of the 
Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, next month to Russia, was 
in connection with the cryogenic resettlement. 
  According to Prof Rao, instead of the old practice of 
designing the vehicle and then identifying industries for 
components' production, ISRO had been developing the technology 
and immediately transferring it to the identified industries for 
production. This, he said, would augment the development of the 
engines at the earliest. 
  The first indigenously designed cryogenic engine for the 
GSLV 
would be ready by 1998 and the test-flight would be carried out 
at different stages of production simultaneously to save time, 
he said. 
  Stating that the first flight would be carried out in six 
months, Prof Rao said the liquid hydrogen plant for the 
production of propellent had been commissioned and various 
testing facilities for the engine on production were in various 
stages. 
  As the multi-start engine was very essential these days, 
ISRO's efforts were now on to develop a two-start engine, he 
said. 
  Asked about his contribution to ISRO during his nearly 
ten-year tenure as chairman, Prof Rao said, "the achievement was 
not personal but that of ISRO," adding from the time when he 
took over ISRO's foundation was good, but subsequent planning 
was needed and the whole programme had to be integrated from 
application to satellites and launch vehicles. 
  As soon as the hub-station was ready, the mobile 
communication system would also be ready and depending on the 
requirement it could be marketed, he observed. 
  About a fall in expenditure in the development of satellite 
programme in the last year from Rs 64.5 crores in 1992-93 to Rs. 
37.9 crores Prof Rao said every year the project changed and 
most of the expenditure was needed at the initial stages. 
However, he denied that the fall was an indication that the 
country's satellite front was saturated. 
  Prof Rao, yesterday said the second indigenously built Polar 
Satellite Launch Vehicle--D2 (PSLV-D2) would be launched in 
July/August this year. 
  Subsequent launches would take place every year. While the 
PSLV-D2 would carry an X-ray satellite apart from the Indian 
Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P2), PSLV-D2 was expected to carry 
a payload for studying ocean development. 
  According to Prof Rao, most of the hardware including three 
PS-1 segments, nozzle and motor interstages were already 
realised for flight and remaining hardware was being finished. 
The only work needed to be done was at the launch pad. 
  The `failure analysis committee' (FAC) constituted to look 
into the cause of the failure of PSLV-D1 had suggested some 
modifications. The FAC had confirmed that all major systems 
integrated in PSLV-D1 had worked as planned and there was no 
serious defect in the design of the vehicle, he said. 
  However, according to Prof Rao, the FAC had confirmed that 
the failure of the PSLV-D1 in reaching the intended orbit was 
primarily due to a software error in the pitch control loop of 
the on-board guidance and control processor. But for this, the 
PSLV-D1 would have reached its orbit, the FAC confirmed. 
  Further, Prof Rao said the fourth developmental launch of 
the 
Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle (ASLV) would be by the end of 
April or first week of May to place a 115 kg payload in a 
circular orbit of 400 km. It is already on the launch pad.

<F P=106> [Article by Dinesh Kumar: "Advertisement Smacks of Scam"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 11--An advertisement placed by the 
defence ministry in specialised national and international 
aviation journals inviting global tenders for sale of certain 
Indian Air Force equipment has left a trail of unanswered 
questions, hinting even at a possible scandal. 
  Among the listed items in the advertisement placed by the 
Special Surplus Stores Disposal Committee (SSSDC) of the 
Ministry of Defence are approximately one lakh pairs of blue 
grey winter uniforms comprising trousers and tunics with belts 
and brass buckles. Surprisingly, all these uniforms are stated 
to be in an absolutely new and unused condition of various sizes. 
  Enquiries, however, reveal that the number is much more. The 
figures of these winter uniforms are in fact 94,000 full pairs 
(tunics and trousers) and 38,000 tunics. 
  The other items, which indeed are of sensitive nature, are 
161 lines comprising electronic equipment for the Russian made 
Surface to Air (SAM-II) missiles guidance system, 126 
serviceable missiles, 35 SAM-II launchers, and missile liquid 
propellants--namely 92 litres of "O" fuel (nitric acid), 53,124 
litres of "G" fuel and 20,785 litres of IPN [expansion not 
given]. 
  The "O" and "G" fuels are used in the Intermediate Range 
`Agni' and surface to air Prithvi missile programmes. It is not 
clear whether the IAF [Indian Air Force] has applied its mind to 
the possible violation of the country's policy of not exporting 
missile technology or materials. As a senior IAF officer pointed 
out, "This could well tantamount to adding to proliferation of 
such dangerous and sensitive equipment," adding "how can we be 
sure that it won't unwittingly end up in Pakistani hands. After 
all it is a global tender and the Pakistanis can buy it, if not 
directly, through indirect means." 
  Among the miscellaneous aircraft spares are 596 line items 
of 
the U.S. origin B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft which 
interestingly was phased out of the IAF in the mid-1960s. Among 
the 10 AN-12 transport aircraft put up for sale are two such 
aircrafts which have flown just 171 and 671 hours each after 
their last overhaul. But then this compares better with the 140 
indigenously developed HE-24 Marut ground attack aircraft which 
was sold as scrap in the early 1980s. 
  Of these 140 Maruts, 40 of them had flown just 20 hours 
each. 
Rather than have further developed on the HF-24, which had cost 
the IAF Rs 69 lakh a piece, its replacement in the form of the 
British Aerospace manufactured Jaguar had then cost the state 
exchequer Rs 8 crore a piece. Today the price per piece of the 
Jaguar is over Rs 60 crore. 
  What has raised special interest in defence circles is the 
large number of winter uniforms in new and unused condition. 
While the Royal Air Force (RAF) of Britain has never changed its 
uniform since its inception, changes have been introduced into 
the IAF uniforms by almost every air chief. However, generally 
speaking, the IAF which provides free uniforms to the 75,000 to 
80,000 airmen, allows for a long changeover period in order to 
ensure complete and proper utilisation of its stocks. On the 
other hand IAF officers are not provided free uniforms and are 
instead entitled to a uniform allowance of Rs 3,000 every seven 
years. 
  When contacted an official spokesman of the IAF said that 
the 
uniforms in question were up to 34 years old dating back to 1960 
and had been accumulated over a period of time. Enquiries with 
the SSSDC, however, revealed that the uniforms were up to 18 
years old. 
  But there is no convincing answer as to how and why such a 
large number of uniforms have been lying, to quote the 
advertisement, in a "new" and "unused" condition for so many 
years. Does it not amount to an unnecessary loss to the state 
exchequer?

  [Text] New Delhi, April 26 -- Research in atmospheric 
science has received a boost with the commissioning of a unique 
radar at Gadanki near Tirupati, which will also ensure safe 
rocket launchings from Sriharikota, launched 80 km away, reports 
PTI. 
  With this new facility, Indian scientists will be able to 
make a detailed study of lower and middle atmospheres and also 
the region of the ionosphere above 100 km, according to Dr P. 
Balarama Rao, director of this radar facility. 
  A link-up of this radar with control room at Sri Harikota 
will enable space scientists to watch out for turbulence and 
wind shears before a rocket is launched. 
  Called Mesophere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar, the Rs 100 
million-facility has been established jointly by five different 
agencies, including, space and defence departments. 
  It consists of a 1024 computer-controlled antenna, arranged 
in 32 rows, whose powerful beam at 53 mega-hertz frequency can 
be aimed at six pre-set directions. 
  Echoes received from the atmosphere are analysed by a 
computer, giving almost instantaneous readings of wind speeds at 
different heights. 
  Atmospheric scientists all over India will have access to 
this MST radar, said to be one of the very few in the world, and 
perhaps the only radar close to the Equator, where the 
atmospheric processes are quite different from those at higher 
latitudes. 
  According to Dr Balarama Rao, the radar will have 
applications ranging from short-term weather forecasting to 
long-term vertical transports of trace elements. It will measure 
vertical wind speeds that cannot be measured from any other 
technique. 
  Dr Rao said the radar also provided Indians the unique 
opportunity to observe "gravity waves" generated by tropical jet 
streams, storms, and interaction of strong winds with large 
mountains. 
  The radar will take only a minute or two to detect wind 
shears and turbulences that could pose hazards to rockets in 
flight.

  [Excerpt] New Delhi, Apr. 27 (PTI)--India is likely to 
emerge as a major space power by the turn of the century and 
would achieve self-sufficiency in satellite launch vehicle 
technology by then, the Lok Sabha was told today. 
  India had emerged as a major space power in satellite 
building and space applications in the areas of communication, 
meteorology, disaster warning and remote sensing, the minister 
of state in Prime Minister's Office, Mr Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi, 
said in a written reply. 
  With two operational space systems, Indian national 
satellite 
(INSAT) and the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS), the 
country had demonstrated its technological capabilities in these 
areas, he said. 
  India had already developed technological capabilities to 
launch 1000 kg IRS class, satellite through design, development 
and testing of polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV), Mr 
Chaturvedi said. 
  The development and operationalisation of geo-synchronous 
satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) before the end of the century, 
will make India self-sufficient in satellite launch vehicle 
technology, he said. 
  The minister also said there was no proposal to shut down 
any 
of the Trombay nuclear research reactors. 
  However, the Apsara and Cirus research reactors were planned 
to be refurbished in view of their long service life of about 38 
years and 34 years, respectively, he added. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "Rao Trying To Please Both Sides?"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 28--The government's confused and 
even contradictory response to the London talks underscores the 
dilemma of the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao. Sources in 
the external affairs ministry say that in his one-to-one 
discussions with Mr Strobe Talbott, he conceded the U.S. demand 
for a multi-lateral conference. However, U.S. counterparts are 
claiming that the Prime Minister was quite definite in his 
commitment while Indian officials claim that the acceptance was 
conditional, the composition, agenda and modalities only being 
thrashed out now in the secret talks, now public knowledge. 
  Most observers accept that Mr Rao will knowingly never do 
anything against the country's interests, but many of them feel 
that the Prime Minister is attempting to undertake the 
near-impossible task of finessing a policy that will satisfy 
both the United States and Indian interests. The talks in 
London, the changed composition of the delegation indicate that 
Mr Rao thinks he can pull it off. 
  One section of the government believes that Mr Krishnan's 
brief is to stall for time and draw out the United States in 
discussions on modalities, composition and so on, and allow the 
Prime Minister to complete his U.S. visit. 
  However, another segment of the bureaucracy advocates 
caution, arguing that the U.S. does not function in this manner 
and will certainly obtain clear-cut Indian commitments before Mr 
Rao reaches Washington, so as to make the Indian Prime 
Minister's visit a substantive one from President Bill Clinton's 
side. Mr Clinton will then be able to tell the U.S. Congress 
that notwithstanding failures on other foreign policy fronts, 
India and Pakistan have been brought around to accept the U.S. 
non-proliferation agenda. 
  It may be recalled that in similar circumstances, in October 
1987, the United States had brought pressure to bear upon India 
to accept port calls from U.S. Navy ships involved in coercing 
Iran. 
  A few weeks prior to Rajiv Gandhi's American visit, the 
United States requested the visit of the USS 
Enterprise to Bombay. But when this was turned down on 
grounds that it went against India's policy of allowing ships 
carrying nuclear arms into Indian ports, the United States 
modified its request asking that only the cruise missile armed 
USS Missouri be permitted. When this too was turned 
down on similar grounds, the United States sent two other 
frigates, which in their own way began the process that ended in 
the Indo-U.S. joint naval exercise in 1992. 
  On second thoughts, the `secret' talks between India and the 
United States in London to decide, "the concept and agenda" for 
the multilateral talks on disarmament, appear even more curious. 
Yesterday in Parliament, the minister of state for external 
affairs, Mr R.L. Bhatia told the Lok Sabha that this was the 
fourth round of bilateral official talks between India and the 
United States. However, the official spokesman declared that it 
was only "another round of bilateral discussions." 
  In response to a question, U.S. officials in New Delhi 
accepted that these were indeed official talks, but made it 
clear that they wished to "stay away from the numbers game," and 
refrained from commenting on whether this was the "fourth," or 
just "another" round of talks. This coyness conceals more 
substantive issues. 
  The three rounds of bilateral talks between India and the 
United States in February and May 1992 and September 1993--were 
between two equal parties discussing security and strategic 
issues. The London "secret" talks are a spin-off of these talks, 
which seek to create a multilateral format to resolve the South 
Asian "problem," by capping and eliminating India and Pakistan's 
nuclear and missile programmes. Here these two countries come 
under one category of "problem" states and the others--the 
United States, U.K., France, Russia, China, Japan and 
Germany--will be the guarantors of the Indo-Pakistani capping 
agreement. Needless to say, this goes not only against the grain 
of not just stated policy, but also Indian security interests. 
  United States' officials are being quite careful to note 
that 
not only are the talks official, since they are being conducted 
by U.S. officials like the deputy assistant secretary of state, 
Mr Robert Einhorn and Mr Norman Wulff, the acting assistant 
director of the non-proliferation bureau, but their presence 
together means that the key requirement of inter-agency 
consultation has been met. 
  In our case, such subtleties do not matter. There appears to 
have been no effort to consult the armed forces or the Ministry 
of Defence, leave alone the Ministry of External Affairs. Even 
more curious is the status of the leader of the Indian 
delegation. "Distinguished," "senior" and "experienced" are the 
adjectives being used to describe this former diplomat, but they 
cannot hide the fact that he is a retired official and is thus 
not quite accountable for his views or conduct to the government. 
  While the official spokesman says that such appointments are 
the prerogative of the government and that Mr Krishnan enjoys 
its confidence, it still does not answer all the queries about 
his mandate and status as well as the manner in which serving 
officials accompanying him are to deal with him. 
  Had he been given the status of a special envoy, such 
questions need not have risen. But then, it is clear by now, 
that the entire episode has been shoddily handled by the 
government that pointing to one issue is of little consequence.

<F P=106> [Article by Manoj Joshi: "A Growing Sense of Disquiet"] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, April 27--During the Talbott visit to the 
subcontinent earlier this month, U.S. officials candidly 
accepted that the "Pakistan track" of their programme to 
eliminate nuclear and missile capability in South Asia was the 
"F-16s for capping" arrangement. But they claimed that they had 
not quite formulated what they had in mind for India. 
  It would appear now, looking at the composition of the 
Indian 
delegation, that the London "secret" talks are being used to 
discuss the "India Track" of the U.S. plan. 
  Also not merely some "principles" or modalities for a 
multilateral conference to eliminate strategic weapons 
capabilities in South Asia. The presence of Ms Meera Shankar, 
commercial attache in Washington and Mr K. Santhanam, Chief 
Adviser Technology in the DRDO [Defense Research Development 
Organization] dealing with Indo-U.S. technology transfer issues 
suggests that the talks will also take up India's taking 
"interim" steps to halt the production of fissile material for 
nuclear weapons, maintaining its cap on its Agni development, as 
well as desisting from deploying the Prithvi missile system in 
exchange for some commercial and technology transfer incentives. 
  The government's decision to use a retired diplomat, Mr N. 
Krishnan to hold the fourth round of the Indo-U.S. dialogue on 
capping India's self-defence capability in "secret," and that 
too in a third country--UK--appears to defy commonsense and 
logic. Depending on the point of view, it appears either 
redundant or ominous. Not surprisingly, it has raised a storm of 
protest in Parliament. The composition of the delegation appears 
to be an effort by the senior-most bureaucrat in the Prime 
Minister's office (PMO) to bypass the established official 
channel through the Ministry of External Affairs. But even the 
choice of the leader of the delegation appears questionable. 
  Mr Krishnan is a distinguished diplomat who has served the 
country in a number of important and challenging assignments. 
But he also has, according to many of his former colleagues, 
strong and not-so-secret views in favour of India signing the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty, something which the government is even 
now saying it is opposed to. 
  Ever since the Prime Minister, Mr Narasimha Rao's meeting 
with President Bush in New York in early 1992, India has been 
committed to a dialogue with the United States on the nuclear 
weapons issue. 
  The United States has made it clear that it would like to 
see 
the elimination of strategic weapons capability in South Asia, 
i.e., ending India's unexercised option to make nuclear weapons 
and its research and development programme for missiles. India 
has, however, till now insisted that this policy is unrealistic 
since it did not take into account India's wider security 
concerns, viz. China. 
  Since March 1992, three rounds of dialogue have been held 
till now with teams led by senior foreign ministry officials. So 
why the change for the fourth round? 
  No clear explanation is available. The public relations 
mills 
at the PMO claim that the MEA [expansion not given] was not 
executing the Prime Minister's policy efficiently. Some 
suspicions that there may be more than just alleged MEA 
incompetence emerged from the dismantling of the team set up by 
the former foreign secretary, Mr J.N. Dixit, in his ministry to 
focus on the dialogue. Some clues are now available from the 
composition of the delegation to London. 
  The presence of Mr Satish Chandra, India's permanent 
representative at Geneva is a fig leaf that cannot hide the lack 
of a substantive MEA representation in the talks considering 
that the first three rounds have been coordinated by them. 
  Mr Rakesh Sood, Director disarmament had to be included in 
the team since he is, at present, the only official familiar 
with various Indian negotiation stances at various bilateral and 
multilateral fora on disarmament issues. 
  The presence of two other persons as well as the leader has, 
as has been noted, provided an ample inkling to the nature of 
the dialogue. 
  But whether this is good for India or not, that it can do 
anything is another aspect. India has no institutional 
arrangements such as a national security council to decide on 
the issues. So policy has been made whimsically. 
  As it is there is now a growing sense of disquiet among 
senior civil servants as well as armed forces officers at the 
recent directions in India's security policies and the 
"extra-constitutional" role being played by some elements in the 
PMO in formulating them. Not unlike Europe, the nuclear and 
missile capabilities in South Asia have stabilised the regional 
situation notwithstanding the Kashmir rebellion. 
  Ironically, the "secret" talks are likely to increase 
Islamabad's sense of unease rather than the other way around 
since there is a belief there, conditioned by its perceptions of 
New Delhi, that the improved tenor [as printed] of Indo-U.S. 
relations is directed against Pakistan. There is some question 
as to whether the United States knows what it is doing and, 
perhaps more germane, whether India does.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Mysterious Meeting"] </F>
  [Text] The misgivings caused by the reports about the 
capping of the Agni programme, which were not entirely removed 
by the Prime Minister's denial in Parliament, are likely to be 
strengthened by the proposed "secret" Indo-U.S. parleys on 
security issues in London. Coming as they do in the wake of the 
Strobe Talbott visit one of whose main objectives was to 
persuade India and Pakistan to take a fresh look at their 
security perceptions, these developments are bound to raise 
questions and even fuel suspicions about a greater and more 
direct American involvement in the affairs of the subcontinent 
than has been the case in the recent past. This is all the more 
so because the United States is known to be unhappy about 
India's efforts to attain self-sufficiency in missile 
technology, as its embargo on the supply of Russian cryogenic 
rockets showed. Washington would also like India to be more 
receptive towards its plan for a nuclear-free South Asia. One of 
the purposes of the proposed multilateral conference on 
disarmament will be to discuss this very issue, notwithstanding 
India's long-held contention that non-nuclear pockets are 
meaningless when a selected group of countries are allowed to 
retain their deadly arsenal. It may well be that the London 
meeting will deal with some of these problems. But what is not a 
little disturbing is the unusual emphasis on secrecy placed by 
the Indian government on the conference. 
  Subsequent clarifications that this was the fourth meeting 
in 
a series and a prelude to the Washington summit between Mr 
Narasimha Rao and Mr Clinton are unlikely to be fully 
convincing. Moreover, the inclusion of a retired diplomat known 
for his preference for the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] will be 
considered significant. It is, of course, up to the government 
to choose its team, but what is nevertheless necessary is that 
there should be an element of transparency in the entire 
exercise. Even if it is granted that diplomatic exchanges cannot 
be conducted in a market place, the government must still inform 
Parliament about what is being discussed with a country which 
not long ago had irked many people in India with its needlessly 
provocative attitude towards a complex and sensitive issue like 
Kashmir. There is also a need to reiterate India's position on 
some of the contentious issues if only to make it abundantly 
clear that there will be no compromises on matters crucial to 
Indian security. Since our concerns relate not to Pakistan 
alone, the government will do well to pay heed to what the BJP 
[Bharatiya Janata Party] leaders said in Parliament about the 
"trap" into which India may walk at the five plus two plus two 
conference. The point the opposition members made about the 
holding of the latest meeting in a third country is also 
relevant, for it suggests that neither government wanted too 
close a monitoring of the discussions. However, such a 
calculation is a naive one in this age of instant 
communications. So New Delhi will be well advised to shed its 
attitude of secrecy and be more open about the talks.

  [Text] Bangalore 9 May -- Efforts are being made to 
increase the strike range of the country's most sophisticated 
weapon `Agni' [long range surface-to-surface missile]. At 
present its range is limited to 1,500 km. Agni's shape may also 
be changed. 
  Dr. A.N. Agarwal, director of the Agni program, gave this 
information while addressing a function organized by the Indian 
Institute of Technology, Madras. He revealed that there will be 
no change in the warhead which at present is capable of carrying 
one tonne of explosives. However, efforts are being made to 
increase the payload capacity during the third stage of the 
missile development, but it has no connection with the warhead 
load. 
  Dr. Agarwal said that the first successful flight of the 
missile proved that India has been able to acquire the 
technology of the 10-tonne G [as published] missile type. The 
later flights proved that the reentry payload can hit the 
smallest of targets. 
  What after Agni? Replying to the question, Dr. Agarwal said 
that we are further refining the latest system of flight data 
analyses. 
  Dr. Agarwal said that the Indian missile program has emerged 
from many pressures. This has given recognition to India in 
this field. He said that most of the modern missile techniques 
are controlled by very few countries. India has developed the 
technique from indigenous technology and available limited 
facilities at its own institutes and with the help of its own 
scientists. 
  He said that the country's young scientists have taken up 
the 
new challenges. Equipment banned under the Missile Technology 
Control regime are being developed. He assured that the country 
will make rapid progress in this field in future. 
  On the subject of missile technology development, Dr. 
Agarwal 
said this was a small program due to which the country can now 
sit and talk with the superpowers on an equal basis. He said 
the developed nations are stubborn in this connection and they 
do not even want to give an ordinary database technique to 
developing nations. 
  About research work being done in different fields, he said 
India will become strong technologically and economically in 
next 20 to 25 years.

  [Text] The government today categorically denied in the 
Rajya Sabha reports appearing in a section of the press about 
the Prime Minister's Office [PMO] stalling the Prithvi [missile] 
test. The minister of state for parliamentary affairs, Mrs. 
Margaret Alva, pointed out that these reports have been already 
refuted by the PMO. She said the prime minister has also 
clarified the matter in parliament. Mrs. Alva has said that the 
prime minister has already discussed with the opposition 
leaders, including the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] leader, Mr. 
Atal Behari Vajpayee, on his forthcoming visit to the United 
States. Earlier, the leader of the opposition in the house, 
Mr. Sikander Bakht, demanded a statement from the prime minister 
on the reports appearing in a daily alleging that the government 
has called off the 13th Prithvi test.

  [Text] The Defense Institute for Fire Research in New 
Delhi has developed a fire fighting system that can detect and 
put out fires in less than one-fourth of a second. The director 
of the institute, Major General B.S. Kataria, said the automatic 
fire and explosion suppression system, as it is called, has been 
fitted on the MBT [Main Battle Tank]-Arjun tank and is to be 
fitted also on the T-72 tanks. He said this fire fighting 
system has been integrated with another system to alert the tank 
crew in the event of a nuclear, biological, and chemical attack. 
The fire protection system can also be fitted in ships and 
armored personnel carriers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S. Threat To Use Force"] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. secretary of the Army has threatened that 
if certain countries do not abandon their nuclear programs, the 
United States will use force to terminate their programs. 
Addressing special centenary celebrations for the U.S. Army 
Command and Staff College, he said that some countries have 
acquired the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. The 
United States is trying to persuade them in a friendly manner, 
but it will not refrain from using force if these efforts fail. 
Ejazul Haq, a former Pakistani minister and member of the 
National Assembly who was present at the function, told JANG's 
special correspondent that although the secretary did not 
mention Pakistan in his speech, it was obvious that he was 
referring to us. This is because he addressed Ejazul Haq in 
particular before mentioning the threat to use force and excused 
himself to Haq when he did mention it. 
  The United States is keenly interested in nuclear 
nonproliferation. It is no secret that it is striving to 
realize this objective throughout the world. It is also 
evident, though, that the U.S. campaign against nuclear weapons 
is neither equitable nor impartial. It has no objection to 
certain countries' nuclear programs and is indirectly assisting 
and supporting the advancement and success of their programs. 
The most conspicuous example is Israel. 
  Informed sources are aware that Israel not only has the 
capability to produce nuclear weapons, it also has a huge 
stockpile of such weapons. Despite knowing this, the United 
States has never expressed any concern about Israel's nuclear 
capability or threatened Israel. On the contrary, Israel tops 
the list of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid. The two 
countries have pursued very close and longstanding technical 
cooperation. It would not be incorrect to say that the United 
States and Israel are two bodies sharing a single heart. It is 
also no secret why the United States has been ignoring the 
Israeli nuclear program. The United States considers Israel its 
closest ally in the Middle East, like a virtual state of the 
United States, and is deeply interested in accelerating its 
defense and nuclear capabilities. 
  Similarly, although the United States keeps protesting 
against the Indian nuclear program, it has never adopted a tough 
stand against the increase in India's nuclear capability, as it 
has with Pakistan or North Korea. In fact, there were occasions 
when the United States -- through France -- indirectly helped 
India continue its nuclear program. Given the circumstances, 
the U.S. threat to use force against Pakistan is very 
regrettable and deserves to be condemned. This attitude is all 
the more amazing in view of the fact that Pakistan has already 
made some very rational and just proposals for winding up its 
nuclear program. Pakistan has proposed that the Indian Ocean be 
made a nuclear-free zone. Pakistan has expressed its readiness 
to open its nuclear installations for international inspection 
on the condition that India does the same. 
  Pakistan has also expressed its willingness to sign the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty provided that India does as 
well. India has not made any positive response to these 
rational and practical proposals. The logical next step would 
have been for the United States and the Western powers to exert 
pressure on India to achieve the goal of nuclear 
nonproliferation. Even if we acknowledge that such pressure was 
exerted, we cannot deny it was done in a half-hearted manner. 
  During U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott's recent visit 
to Pakistan, Pakistan expressed its willingness to implement any 
just proposal on nuclear nonproliferation. The Indian response, 
on the other hand, was disappointing. Under the circumstances, 
the U.S. secretary's threat of using force against Pakistan is 
incomprehensible and extremely regrettable. We are fully 
confident that despite the U.S. secretary's threat, Pakistan 
will adhere to its principled stand and that the United States 
will not succeed in bullying this country. It is inappropriate 
for the United States to use such language. 
  Certain quarters of the Pakistani Government are overly 
optimistic that a way can be found to provide limited defense 
aid to Pakistan despite the Pressler Amendment. The latest 
pronouncement by the U.S. secretary of the Army should be enough 
of an eye opener. The Pakistani Government should seriously make 
every possible effort to meet its defense needs through 
non-American sources. Also, the government should obtain the 
text of the secretary's speech, examine its implications, and 
lodge a protest with the U.S. Government if warranted.

  [Text] Lahore -- Pakistan's atomic scientist Dr Abdul 
Qadeer Khan has said that Pakistan has rejected unilateral 
pressure on its nuclear programme. Through argumentation, it 
has got the pressure released to some extent and now some 
pressure has been diverted to India too which was not the case 
before. 
  Talking to THE NATION and NAWA-I-WAQT on Friday, he said by 
the grace of God "we are fully capable of defending the country 
and military-wise our country is in strong hands. In this 
connection, no one should have any misunderstanding, nor does 
anyone need to worry about that." 
  Commenting, he said the present government has realised the 
importance of defence and has provided the required funds. Both 
the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff are fully 
aware of the situation. That is why, no cut has been made in 
the defence budgetary allocations. He said if need be "we are 
ready to ask the nation for donations for country's defence." 
  Emphasising unity, he said it strengthens the defence. But 
the nation is not united to the extent it should be. There are 
two methods of getting the defence strengthened: first, to 
increase the military capability and, second, by increasing 
friends at diplomatic and political levels. "Sometimes you 
achieve a goal diplomatically which is difficult militarily or 
otherwise." However, he said, one cannot deny the importance of 
military might. "This is because you have more friends when you 
are powerful and the country which is weak economically and 
militarily cannot make many friends." 
  He said the present political situation demands that "we get 
united". National unity is very important he repeated. No 
country can endeavour to establish peace single-handedly as this 
is the responsibility of all the countries of the region. 
Whichever proposals Pakistan has given for peace have been 
appreciated by all the countries, Iran, China and even the U.S. 
has declared it a positive approach. But India has not liked 
these suggestions, he added. "If India does not like our 
proposals, it should give its own." India should bring its 
proposals at the negotiating table, he said, adding that "we 
want permanent peace in the region as much as does someone else." 
  He said the impression that "we the atomic scientists are 
against peace is wrong." Any general or atomic scientist loves 
peace as much as others do. 
  Coming to the Kashmir issue, he said Pakistan wants peaceful 
solution to the issue. Pakistan has given some proposals for 
establishment of peace in the region and now it is the duty of 
India to respond positively. 
  Answering a question on Kalabagh Dam, he said the 
apprehensions and fears which some people have must be addressed 
Changes in the designs of the project and other such matters 
[word indistinct] introduced with the consent of all the 
concerned, but this matter should not be politicised. Those 
having objections to the plan should make their objections clear 
and those who are responsible to remove these should do that. 
  He said instead of politicians the debate on this project 
should be given to the experts. Besides, no hurdles should be 
created in this plan. He said it is generally believed that 
this dam should not be built, for it would result in some loss. 
Whereas the other opinion is that this plan is very much in the 
nation's interest and, accordingly, it should be started at the 
earliest. 
  He said when a big project is started, some people do get 
affected. The construction of Tarbela and Mangla Dams also 
affected many but it also benefited the entire nation. The 
government paid the compensation to the affectees. 
  He said the power crisis can be overcome by setting up 
nuclear power stations. He revealed that fresh round of talks 
between Pakistan and France on atomic power plant is about to 
commence. France promised to give Pakistan that plant. Later 
on, it did not fulfil its promise due to certain reasons, "I 
think we have the right to get that plant and I hope 
negotiations would start soon which would prove useful." 
  He said there is no denying the fact that there was much 
pressure in the past as regards its peaceful nuclear programme. 
But the stance of Pakistan has forced those pressurising 
elements to see the reality, Pakistan has always adopted the 
stance that it should not be discriminated against as far as the 
atomic programme is concerned. Rather both Pakistan and India 
should be treated alike. 
  Further, Pakistan's proposal to declare South Asia 
nuclear-free region was appreciated by all with the sole 
exception of India. Pakistan has clearly stated that it favours 
nuclear proliferation. [sentence as published] But this is 
something Pakistan cannot do alone. If this aim is to be 
achieved. India too would have to be convinced. 
  He said Pakistan rejected any unity lateral pressure on it 
because of which the supply of F-16s has been suspended although 
Pakistan has paid for the aircraft. Even then Pakistan did not 
compromise on its national defence. "Had we compromised, the 
aircraft would not have been withheld and supply of other 
military aid too would have started again. "We think the 
present government has got the pressure released through its 
logics and now some pressure has been diverted to India." 
  He said getting any country's atomic programme frozen and 
linking it with foreign aid can in no way be declared in line 
with the UN Charter or international demands. Every country has 
the right to utilise all its resources to ensure its defence. 
However, if a formula is chalked out to ensure international 
peace, it should be applied to all the countries without any 
discrimination. 
  India increased its defence budget. It is a big country. 
What danger does it have? It has no threat from any other 
country. It has increased its defence budget only to establish 
its regional supremacy. But the old ideas to establish 
supremacy have died out as even small states can make their 
defence strong against big countries. 
  He said Benazir Bhutto and COAS [Chief of Army Staff] Gen 
Abdul Waheed are fully aware of the situation. That is why, no 
cuts have been made in the budgetary allocations for defence. 
Had India reduced its defence budget. Pakistan too had an 
option. 
  The attitude of the government, its foreign policy, the 
steps 
it took as regards Kashmir and the decisions taken by the 
political and military leadership are correct. He, however, 
said the present steps being taken for the scientific and 
technological development are not enough. "We have to do much 
more in this connection." 
  Dr Qadeer observed the energy crisis has not surfaced 
overnight. There are many reasons behind them. As such, it 
cannot be overcome overnight. Particularly the economic and 
energy crises cannot be redressed overnight. 
  The common man thinks about what the previous governments 
have done in this regard. Had some concrete steps been taken at 
the very outset, the situation would have been different. Its a 
good sign that the present government had initiated some plans 
for energy. But energy crisis would take some time. 
  He said even the Ministers do not want to take the 
portfolios 
of Science and Technology. "This shows how much interest we 
take in this field. Fund collection is no problem." Like other 
benefit shows, one can be arranged to better the economic 
conditions of the country too, he concluded.

"Future of Russian Nuclear Potential"] 
  [Text] The Soviet leadership's political thinking, 
particularly as regards military-political strategy, used to be 
compared in the old days to studied chess gambits. The 
circumstances of the USSR's collapse and the rapid degradation 
of society call into question the correctness of this 
complimentary comparison -- at any rate as regards the skills of 
many of the "chess players" of the perestroyka period. The 
historians of the future, however, will as usual voice varying 
opinions about 20th century Russian history and about whether 
the last Soviet leadership had an inferiority complex or whether 
they were pioneering a new era, and so forth. What will be seen 
as history by the researchers of the future, for us increasingly 
boils down to the problem of survival. Consequently, as we 
encounter very urgent matters every day it does not seem out of 
place to attempt to sort out at least certain rules and the 
sense of the game in which Russia is a player in the nuclear 
arms sphere. 
  The current era of total change is, apart from anything 
else, 
also a time of radical change in geostrategic realities and ways 
of thinking. The speed and spontaneity of these changes are 
probably the reason why our so-called post-Soviet society is 
parting willingly (and even with unmitigated enthusiasm) from 
the state appurtenances that largely determined the USSR's 
status as a military "superpower." There is something 
irrational -- though easily explained in terms of the systemic 
crisis in society and its revolutionary nihilism -- in the fact 
that we are putting paid with equal measures of indifference 
("we don't need that any more!") to the, in many respects 
controversial but nonetheless technically sophisticated, "Buran" 
(and thus, in practice, to our entire "state-funded space 
effort"); to aircraft-carrying cruisers -- and next it will be 
the turn of the entire oceangoing fleet; and to ABM defense and 
air-defense installations and strategic ground force groupings 
west of Smolensk and south of Sochi. 
  There is, however, a sphere of social and professional 
interests where the consequences of the possible changes should 
be analyzed with particular care and where discussions should be 
conducted by specialists in a constructive spirit without any 
interference from emotions and not necessarily in conjunction 
with other information such as, say, the examination of the 
START II Treaty by the new parliament or the adoption of a 
long-term program for military organizational development. It 
will be a question of the prospects for developing our strategic 
nuclear forces, which can quite justifiably be called the 
scepter in the double-headed eagle's claw. 
  It is time to recognize that behind the numerous discussions 
about the expediency of retaining, removing, or adopting certain 
weapons systems and their quantitative and qualitative 
parameters lies a principled and so fundamental question that 
people prefer not to consider it -- will Russia be able under 
these conditions that are new to it to preserve its nuclear 
potential and in what form? It is no secret that a number of 
important components in the nuclear system that used to exist 
have been lost, and traditional problems such as, for instance, 
the no-first-use of nuclear weapons and the relationship between 
a retaliatory strike and a counterstrike are being reconsidered 
and reinterpreted. Thus, the question of the future of Russia's 
nuclear potential is becoming not so much theoretical as 
practical -- particularly now that the lack of funds and the 
absence of constant and focused attention from top organs of 
power to the problems of the strategic nuclear forces could lead 
to their irreversible degradation. In tandem with this, the 
protracted uncertainty about ratification of the Strategic 
Offensive Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) threatens to 
seriously delay the entire future disarmament process and 
introduces additional problems to the choice of the ideal 
solutions for modernizing the Russian Armed Forces' strategic 
nuclear component. 
  Statesmen who should already be taking responsible steps to 
choose long-term avenues for the organizational development of 
nuclear strategic forces are feeling an urgent need for a more 
accurate system of references in the emerging geopolitical 
situation, a need to understand what global military-political 
situation they will have to face in the future. And it is very 
important for them that some fragments of the picture of the 
future -- despite the turbulent processes of change in the world 
order -- are in a number of aspects acquiring new outlines. 
  A typical feature of the emergent era will be a change in 
the 
overall structure of influence in the world. Many specialists 
are noting that the bipolar structure with two opposed 
superpowers -- the United States and the USSR -- is being 
replaced by a more traditional multipolar structure which, by 
reducing the opportunities for the superpowers to determine the 
course of world development, will enhance the role of other 
countries (such as the countries of Europe and the Pacific 
region), diversifying the arsenal of their ways and means of 
influencing world politics. According to a number of forecasts, 
the weakening of U.S. economic positions in favor of West Europe 
and Japan will make the United States' bonds of alliance with 
its partners in Europe and Asia more short-term and unstable, 
and international relations more complex, unstable, and less 
predictable as a result. Hence, the overall political situation 
in the world may be less predictable, hard to control even at 
regional, not to mention global, level, and likely to result in 
the emergence of acute crises and the appearance of additional 
spurs to confrontation. The distant rumbles of thunder can 
already be heard. 
  In the context of a multipolar world with criteria of 
influence and stability that are somewhat different and by no 
means always advantageous for Russia, when additional room is 
created for multilateral political maneuver, allies can very 
quickly become enemies, and the principle of "every man for 
himself" (remembering G. Washington's behest) prevails 
increasingly clearly in politics -- under these circumstances it 
is hardly sensible to rush into all-out disarmament, giving up 
our national nuclear forces or even discussing handing them over 
to some kind of collective control. It would be an unforgivable 
mistake, giving in to complacent ideas about the end of the era 
of confrontation, to "tear the tails off" all Russia's strategic 
missiles, although this does not at all mean that we should not 
use the entire panoply of peaceful means of safeguarding 
Russia's national security or that we should end the disarmament 
negotiations. 
  The range of opinions on this issue, particularly now that 
politics has become part and parcel of our public awareness, is 
quite broad. Thus, there is a view (voiced in particular by 
ISKRAN [expansion unknown] staffers S.K. Oznobishchev and A.V. 
Surikov) that at a time of the transition to the building of 
strategic partnership relations between Russia and the United 
States, the use of the strategic stability criteria which were 
successfully used in the postwar decades is becoming senseless. 
Since this is the case, despite all the reservations befitting 
the current situation, nuclear weapons are allegedly becoming a 
kind of burden for Russia and should be gradually turned into 
the "last guarantee" of the security system "not only for Russia 
and the United States in isolation, but perhaps for a whole 
group of states united behind the principles of a collective 
security system within the UN framework." 
  Admittedly, it seems as though the United States is not yet 
ready to share with Russia its experience of these innovations, 
even though their general human and humanitarian thrust is 
evident. The nuclear powers' lack of enthusiasm on this subject 
is possibly explained by the fact that achieving an ideal 
combination of individual and collective means of defense is a 
complicated task with no single solution. But that is a 
separate discussion. The actual agenda is different, and one 
specific problem is that Russia should maintain effective 
national strategic nuclear forces. At the same time, it somehow 
seems as though our enemy now is not any specific country or 
group of countries, but uncertainty (incidentally, the 
transition to planning for uncertainty has already been 
reflected in some official U.S. documents on military-strategic 
issues). 
  If we set out the development of military thinking in the 
nuclear planning sphere extremely simply and without any serious 
distortions, it can be said that the development of nuclear 
weapons arsenals has made certain changes to the targeted role 
of military strategy, which has become more broadly interpreted 
and is seen as a military-political strategy. In reality this 
has meant a change of emphasis in nuclear planning from the 
possibility of directly winning a nuclear war to the sphere of 
implementing political goals by means of the threat of war. The 
concept of political deterrence has supplemented the concept of 
nuclear deterrence -- literally "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" [sderzhivaniye posredstvom yadernogo ustrasheniya]. 
It was based on the principle of the "balance of terror" -- the 
certainty that each party to a potential nuclear conflict would 
inevitably suffer unacceptable damage in any nuclear war 
scenario. The logic of deterrence presupposed the permanent 
building up of the two superpowers' nuclear potentials and an 
increase in the number of nuclear munitions and delivery systems 
to an irrational level (a kind of "foolish multitude") that 
guaranteed the impossibility of one side winning in any 
meaningful way. Implementation of this concept turned into an 
outright arms race. 
  At the end of the sixties the stupidity of this approach to 
the organizational development of strategic nuclear forces was 
so obvious that the parties to the confrontation came to the 
conclusion that it was expedient to seek (very cautiously and 
gradually) new approaches to maintaining strategic stability and 
to implementing the concept of combining nuclear deterrence with 
arms control (so far only control). 
  If the strategic nuclear forces of the two states (or 
coalitions of states) are capable of inflicting unacceptable 
damage on each other in retaliation (retaliatory strikes and 
counterstrikes), then both sides restrain each other from 
aggression, military equilibrium exists between the states, and, 
consequently, military-strategic stability in their relations is 
maintained. Thus, deterrence is achieved by the possibility that 
strategic nuclear forces will deliver a retaliatory strike of 
such force in response to an enemy first strike that the idea of 
carrying out a first strike ceases to be attractive. 
  The method of maintaining strategic balance on the basis of 
the use of nuclear deterrence proved its effectiveness from many 
standpoints over the decades. But, like any "precision" 
instrument, it is very fragile and subject to many factors in 
real life. Thus, of itself the conclusion that stability exists 
at any specific moment of time requires a very complex analysis 
of the military-political and military-technical reality, and 
consideration of a huge number of varied and, moreover, variable 
quantities in the most unexpected areas. We can also cite the 
sensitivity of this kind of stability to different symmetries 
and asymmetries in arms systems, and imbalances between rivals 
even within the framework of the "simple bipolar world." Any 
changes in military potentials, on the one hand, promote the 
emergence of excessive suspicion in interstate relations, while, 
paradoxically, on the other hand objectively requiring the 
maintenance of a certain level of mutual confidence. 
  In this context many necessary but unilateral steps to 
sensibly improve national armed forces could upset the strategic 
equilibrium and should therefore be most carefully weighed up 
from the standpoint of whether or not they will be seen by the 
opposite side as an attempt to change the balance in its favor. 
Caution or active enmity can be caused by the improvement of 
the technical potential of conventional (nonnuclear) weapons, 
particularly in terms of warhead accuracy and yield, the 
development [sozdaniye] of any ABM systems with ambiguous roles, 
and so forth. The problem of somebody acquiring a decisive 
military advantage through a technological breakthrough also 
remains very topical. This likelihood does exist, which could 
tempt people to play their "untrumpable" card for the purposes 
of strong-arm blackmail. 
  That is why Russia and the United States, like other states, 
need to improve their strategic nuclear forces in areas that 
strengthen strategic equilibrium. And corresponding joint 
information about weapons systems in service should be envisaged. 
  In order to define the main avenues for the organizational 
development of national nuclear deterrence forces it is very 
useful to comprehensively analyze and take account of new 
concepts which have recently been actively developed and 
actually implemented by Western specialists in the sphere of 
strategic planning. These concepts are based on the initial 
premise that the most realistic threat to the security of the 
United States and its NATO allies now comes not from Russia and 
the other CIS countries but from "authoritarian" regimes (read 
"unfriendly," as distinct, for instance, from "friendly 
dictators"), or regional interstate and interethnic conflicts 
using conventional weapons. It is within the framework of this 
doctrine that Western specialists have embarked on the 
elaboration of new approaches which will define the principles 
governing the use of nuclear arsenals for the next 10-20 years. 
In the United States in particular, in early 1993 L. Aspin, the 
then U.S. defense secretary, had already ordered an urgent 
review of the concept of the use of U.S. strategic nuclear 
forces. Although officially the adoption of the new concept is 
planned only for this year, the main problems that have arisen 
in the course of its elaboration have been covered in sufficient 
detail. In particular, the U.S. strategists will not only have 
to revise the list of targets, but also review once again 
whether the United States needs such a big nuclear potential, 
since maintaining it at its current level costs the United 
States $10 billion a year at a time when the threat of an 
all-out nuclear war has significantly diminished. The military 
are also having to "rethink the methods for deterring new and 
old enemies." 
  It is worth noting that, in L. Aspin's opinion (and there is 
hardly any doubt about his competence on geostrategic matters), 
the main threat to U.S. security is now posed not by an 
increasingly predictable ("transparent") global strategic foe -- 
as was the Soviet Union -- but by a whole team of "political 
monsters" in the shape of "nuclear smugglers and double-dealing 
governments that reject international norms." 
  For all the lack of ambiguity in the interpretations of the 
role played by nuclear weapons in the present-day world, the 
renewed U.S. concept of "containment by means of nuclear 
deterrence" nonetheless remains the most important nuclear 
planning idea for the United States, and the novel aspect of the 
utilization of strategic nuclear forces will most probably lie 
in the search for "some kind of devilishly inventive new 
principles." Nothing is as yet known about these, incidentally 
-- although L. Aspin admitted, discovering compelling reasons 
for it, that the approach of "monitoring the nuclear arsenal 
together with a threat of retribution" which had effectively 
influenced the Soviet Union, "may not frighten the new owners of 
nuclear weapons at all." In this event it cannot be ruled out, 
at least theoretically, that there will be an expanded range of 
missions for strategic nuclear weapons to carry out -- from 
peaceful containment through deterrence on the basis of the 
inflicting of unacceptable damage, to the limited combat use of 
nuclear weapons alongside conventional (nonnuclear) systems. 
The main aim of the limited combat use of nuclear weapons would 
be to prevent a military conflict from developing into all-out 
hostilities -- that is, in an unfavorable direction for the 
state under attack -- and to defuse the conflict. We cannot 
rule out new and original ways of parrying the threat from 
"nuclear smugglers and double-dealing governments." For 
instance, the potential threat of nuclear terrorism could be 
eliminated by implementing the idea of global information 
transparency in the nuclear sphere, whereby secret activity in 
manufacturing and moving not only nuclear devices, but in 
accumulating a "critical mass" of fissile materials would become 
impossible. Governments that prove intractable in this area 
could be (as has already happened) removed from the political 
scene for the required period of time by establishing control 
over the ruling elites in these countries or with the help (and 
there are plenty of examples of this too) of limited military 
and other sanctions -- which would easily be feasible within the 
framework of a policy of regionalism or simply under UN mandate. 
But the latter measures might not always be successful -- 
therefore the reality of using strong-arm methods, regrettable 
though it may be, should be retained. 
  We should be more interested in the question of whether 
Russia is ready to propose its own vision of the use of 
strategic nuclear forces. The undoubtedly honest position of 
the new Russian military doctrine -- now being extensively 
commented upon -- on the possible use of a nuclear first strike 
can be seen mainly as a reaction to traditional strategic 
challenges and as being largely brought about by the country's 
situation and, accordingly, by the state of its Armed Forces. 
To all appearances, even the modernization of Russia's 
strategic nuclear forces, which is suggested under the framework 
of the treaties on offensive arms reduction, does not make it 
possible to do anything but implement deterrence within the 
framework also of the "traditional" military-strategic situation 
with the criterion of inflicting unacceptable damage on any 
aggressor in retaliatory action. 
  When talking of the category of "unacceptable damage," we 
should take account of present-day views of this problem. We 
realize now that this category has, as it were, two dimensions, 
and can be framed within two systems of coordinates. It is 
usual to consider (and, incidentally, this understanding emerged 
relatively recently), that the criterion of unacceptable damage 
exists simultaneously as a certain quantitative level of losses 
and as a kind of psychological barrier. 
  The question of the norm of unacceptable damage is 
incredibly 
complex. Military specialists honestly admit the failure of the 
numerous attempts to define a more or less objective level for 
it. Staffs in both Russia and the United States are now using in 
their practical activity the mathematical value of a set amount 
of damage (required for deterrence) which nonetheless plays an 
important role in assessing the strategic balance when defining 
the limits of restrictions in the course of drawing up 
disarmament treaties and, most important of all, serves as a 
kind of guideline in shaping major state programs for the 
quantitative and qualitative development of strategic offensive 
arms. 
  We should not downplay the positive significance that the 
idea of a quantitative assessment of the force required to 
inflict "unacceptable damage" on an enemy has possessed for the 
development of the strategic situation, looked at 
retrospectively. It was this idea that made it possible to 
conclude more or less objectively that there was nuclear parity 
between the USSR and the United States -- which made it possible 
for one of the parties to dump its psychological baggage and 
provided an incentive for a disarmament process based on mutual 
recognition of the impossibility of either side's winning any 
substantial advantage in the context of balanced cuts in 
strategic offensive arms. At the same time, let us emphasize 
yet again that the criterion of "unacceptable damage" was to all 
intents and purposes never used as the basis for the adoption of 
the "final" decision to launch a nuclear strike within the 
context of the nuclear deterrence doctrine. Its mechanistic 
meaning (incidentally, if it could have been used as a 
guideline, then the choice of the time to launch a first strike 
could easily have been delegated to computers) cannot be related 
to the huge moral responsibility which a political leader would 
have to assume when deciding to start a nuclear war. We need 
only recall the Caribbean crisis, when the correlation of 
nuclear munitions was 17-1 in favor of the United States. (The 
Soviet Union had around 290 nuclear munitions, while the 
Americans had something in the order of 5,000). You can also 
imagine under what scenario the war in the Persian Gulf would 
have been played out if Iraq had had a few primitive nuclear 
munitions at the time. Most probably there would have been no 
war, and the task of liberating Kuwait would have been resolved 
by different means. 
  Few people give much thought to the fact that the category 
of 
terror and the category of "unacceptable damage" in its 
psychological dimension are historical categories -- times 
change, old moral principles and stereotypes are being tightened 
up and new ones are taking shape; attitudes toward the 
permissibility and probability of nuclear war are also being 
reconsidered by the political leaders of the major nuclear 
powers. Throughout postwar history common sense has never yet 
deseted them, which has made it possible at least to avert 
several global nuclear conflicts. There are no grounds for 
supposing that the current U.S. leaders have "frozen" their idea 
of what constitutes acceptable damage for their country as a 
result of an exchange of nuclear strikes with Russia at the 
level imagined by President Eisenhower. When in 1989 the U.S. 
plan for a nuclear attack on the USSR, drawn up in 1957, was 
declassified, environmental specialists were quick to produce a 
model of the consequences for the United States of launching 
such a nuclear strike against the USSR. It turned out that if 
all the planned 180 high-yield atomic and hydrogen bombs were 
exploded on Soviet territory, the USSR would be guaranteed to 
cease to exist as a state, but in two or three weeks the level 
of radioactive fallout on U.S. territory as a result of the 
natural spread of radioactive dust through atmospheric air 
currents would be comparable to 60 Chernobyls. Of course, the 
accuracy of these assessments (from the "greenhouse effect" to 
"nuclear winter") can be disputed, but one would like to hope 
that nobody would try to do a real experiment to check them out. 
  More and more experts today are inclined to think that 
nuclear weapons cannot be used in principle. 
  It is, nevertheless, not possible to wholly agree with this, 
since the unambiguous exclusion of the possibility of the use of 
nuclear weapons removes their deterrent effect. You could even 
use sophistry to prove the opposite. But in practice the basis 
of deterrence is the probability of the use of nuclear weapons. 
References to the irrationality of their use and their terrible 
consequences, which make it impossible to achieve the political 
aims of a war, are convincing but leave room for doubt. For 
instance, in August 1914, when World War I was already building 
up a head of steam in Europe, certain U.S. newspapers thought it 
appropriate to state something to the effect that the systems 
(primarily artillery systems) in the sides' arsenals were so 
destructive that it was difficult even to imagine the 
consequences of a war -- and therefore there could simply not be 
a war. Another example is that Indian tradition has it that the 
events described in the heroic epic "The Mahabharata" (compiled 
in its present form around the middle of the first millennium) 
relate to some wars and great social upheavals of the fourth 
millennium BC. The epic describes various types of what we 
would now call mass destruction weapons, whose use required a 
difficult psychological barrier to be overcome. R. Oppenheimer, 
one of the developers of the atomic bomb, directly associated 
the Mahabharata's "light brighter than a thousand suns" with a 
nuclear explosion. For us it is not so important which modern 
arms systems might correlate to the types of weapons described 
there. What is important was something else -- there was an 
entire science behind their use (star-gazing and their own 
system of combat using "divine weapons"). "No man should ever 
think of warring with them. Should they fall into the hands of 
the weak, they could consume this entire transient world. They 
should always be used as a defense against other weapons. They 
are wonderful, they cannot be parried, but they can repulse an 
attack in which any other weapon is used [divnoye, ono 
neotvratimo, no udar vsyakim drugim oruzhiyem ono otbivayet]." 
The psychological barrier was nonetheless overcome, and the 
weapons were used, despite the warning that some types of them 
would lead to an effect, seen in a modern reading, on the human 
genetic code. We can only hope that the current system of 
deterrence will prove more effective. 
  It should not, however, be thought that the existence of 
nuclear forces under present-day conditions is able to prevent 
the unleashing of any conventional wars and armed conflicts -- 
particularly on the periphery of the superpowers' spheres of 
influence. Since there are a now a multitude of precisely such 
conflicts, nuclear weapons are not omnipotent. Hence the need 
to develop conventional systems -- precision weapons. The 
development of precision weapons is also expedient for another 
reason -- states (albeit in the very distant future, or at least 
not in the foreseeable future) may give up nuclear weapons, and 
the full burden of the task of ensuring deterrence will be borne 
by conventional weapons systems. This will not happen in one 
sudden surge, there should be a long period when the task of 
deterrence is resolved through the combined use of nuclear and 
conventional systems. But the task of developing precision 
weapons is very complex, requires the diversion of considerable 
material and financial expenditure, and will last just as long 
-- since it depends on the development [razrabotka] not just of 
precision systems but on computerized reconnaissance, targeting, 
and guidance networks. Consequently, the basis for its 
elaboration should be developed right now. But, at the same 
time, it is necessary to recall that if a state does not have 
the requisite conventional weapons for deterrence, then it 
should not destroy its nuclear weapons even if all other states 
scrapped their nuclear weapons. Otherwise this would lead to a 
destabilization of the situation and to the possible unleashing 
of a war or military conflict. 
  Thus, we can conclude that the main role of the Russian 
strategic nuclear forces should be to continue to safeguard 
Russia's national security. And the makeup of these forces, the 
technical features of their systems, the organization of their 
combat and auxiliary subunits, and so forth should meet two 
criteria -- first, the ability to effectively deter any 
aggressor against launching a war; and, second, the ability to 
put a stop to aggression by ruling out the possibility of a 
military conflict escalating into large-scale hostilities, to 
suppress military conflict, and to ensure a quest for compromise 
in the course of peace talks. 
  From the preceding reflections it becomes clear that we 
currently have a fundamental opportunity for a fairly broad 
choice of ways to develop the Russian strategic nuclear forces. 
It is even permissible to speak of their possible radical 
restructuring with the complete renouncement of the use of old 
stereotypes and strategic concepts, as if going back to the very 
beginning, and, incidentally, the situation reagrding the 
reappraisal of values in the country as a whole accords with 
this. However, in the face of the systemic crisis which Russia 
and other CIS states have found themselves in, tough 
restrictions, mainly financial ones, have been imposed on the 
choice of real ways of developing strategic offensive arms. The 
majority of Russian military specialists agree that only two of 
them are realistically practicable: Either to "go it alone" and 
take unilateral steps to reduce the numerical strength of the 
strategic nuclear forces and change their structure, or else to 
conduct the modernization of the strategic nuclear forces within 
the framework of the process of the mutual reduction of 
strategic nuclear arms with our former main opponent, and then 
in coordination with other member states of the nuclear club. 
Circumstances have taken shape in such a way that Russia has 
taken the second path, which is justified in the present 
conditions. Although well-founded misgivings exist concerning 
the possibility of the American side, even within the framework 
of the restrictions of the START I and START II Treaties, to 
quickly increase its nuclear potential if the United States were 
to withdraw from these treaties, the rules of the game which 
have been adopted are nevertheless better than a situation 
whereby the Americans could do this without any of the current 
restrictions. 
  START II, as an important international document, has been 
the subject of a most careful study by a wide circle of Russian 
experts. A multitude of articles exists on practically every 
aspect of the problems of strategic stability, which this treaty 
raises and broaches. The fact that good work has been done on 
this question from the viewpoint of information and analysis 
obviates the need for us to further examine the quantitative and 
qualitative restrictions which the treaty places on the 
strategic nuclear potentials of Russia and the United States. 
It is appropriate to ask oneself just the main question here: 
Will the treaty preserve strategic stability and will the new 
level of the nuclear potential estyablished for Russia be 
sufficient as a deterrent? When analyzing these problems, two 
focal points in the discussions of various aspects of this 
treaty must be singled out. This concerns first of all a 
triadic (Strategic Missile Forces plus Navy and Air Force 
strategic nuclear forces) or a dyadic (Strategic Missile Forces 
plus either Navy or Air Force strategic nuclear forces, and so 
on) structure of the strategic nuclear forces, and the number of 
nuclear munitions which Russia is authorized to have. Second, 
the quantitative distribution of the number of munitions among 
the various components (naval, air, and land-based) of strategic 
offensive arms. The expediency of a triadic or dyadic structure 
of strategic nuclear forces for a particular state is determined 
by its geostrategic position, the capacity of its technical 
personnel and resources for servicing strategic nuclear weapons, 
the tactical-technical characteristics of the strategic nuclear 
forces it has, and the parameters of its means of active 
counteraction against a potential adversary. Thus, by assessing 
the aforesaid parameters of the United States' systems, we will 
obtain practically equal combat capabilities for the land-based 
and naval components of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces in 
terms of hitting targets. This testifies to the possibility of 
the United States transferring to a dyadic (naval and air 
components) structure of strategic nuclear forces and the 
elimination of land-based ICBM's. 
  Unlike the United States, an effective strategic nuclear 
forces structure for Russia which would guarantee the nuclear 
deterrence of any aggressor in any strategic situations, is a 
triad: Strategic Missile Forces plus Naval strategic nuclear 
forces plus Air Force strategic nuclear forces. Excluding the 
Strategic Missile Forces, the Naval strategic nuclear forces or 
the Air Force strategic nuclear forces from the triadic 
structure of Russia's strategic nuclear forces would lead, 
according to certain calculations, to an increase in the number 
of nuclear munitions required for deterrence within the 
strategic nuclear forces by a factor of 1.2-1.6, and in 
individual strategic situations, to the nonfulfill of the combat 
mission. This discrepancy in the rational structures whereby 
the Russian and the U.S. strategic nuclear forces are composed 
is attributable to the inferior survivability of the naval 
component of Russia's strategic nuclear forces (see V. 
Belousov's article) as compared with the analogous parameters of 
the U.S. strategic nuclear forces. This deficiency in the 
Russian naval strategic nuclear forces may be compensated for 
and is compensated for by a Strategic Missile Forces land-based 
stationary and also road-mobile force. The triadic structure of 
the Russian strategic nuclear forces provides a guaranteed 
counter to technological breakthroughs in the military sphere, 
for example in air defense, ABM defense, or antisubmarine 
defense. Such a strategic nuclear force structure creates a 
great deal of uncertainty for a possible aggressor as to the 
effectiveness of his preemptive strike, and is a factor which 
stabilizes the strategic equilibrium. Therefore it is 
impermissible to remove one of the components from the Russian 
strategic nuclear forces.

  [Text] Barnaul May 13 TASS -- Residents in the Altay 
territory were subjected to radiation from 58 explosions between 
1949 and 1990, including the first thermonuclear weapon test in 
August 1953, said speakers at the three-day session of the 
Scientific Council in Barnaul on the appraisal of Semipalatinsk 
explosions aftermaths on the Altay territory population. 
  Results of investigations confirm that the radioactive 
fallout of nuclear detonations at the Semipalatinsk proving 
ground covered nearly the entire Altay territory. People 
received doses on the verge of radiation injury in some areas. 
  Over a third of population living in fallout areas died in 
the first five-seven years after the 1949 explosion. A new wave 
of oncological diseases, hemopathies, diseases of hematogenetic 
organs and genetic mutations is now observed when the third 
generation of radiated people has become child-bearing. 
  These and other facts from the history of Soviet nuclear 
testing were revealed at the above-mentioned session which ended 
its work on Friday. It was attended by scientists from nearly 
60 research institutions. 
  Physicists, chemists, biologists, doctors and sociologists 
discussed the results of last year's research work and progress 
in implementing the "Polygon" comprehensive programme in the 
Altay territory, providing for urgent measures to overcome 
aftermaths of nuclear explosions, to improve the ecological 
situation and people's health as well as to give a boost to 
social and economic development of afflicted villages. 
  The session mapped out guidelines for further research. 
Valentin Koptyug, president of the Siberian branch of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed to the great importance for 
the international scientific community of massive medical 
checkup of irradiated people, which was carried in the Altay 
territory for the first time in the world. 
  According to scientists, this session of "the programme on 
distant radiation aftereffects of nuclear tests at the 
Semipalatinsk proving ground on the Altay territory population" 
(official name of the session) has also become an important 
stage in preparations for an international conference on the 
"radtest" (radiation test) programme to be held in the Altay 
territory next September.

  [Text] Izhevsk May 16 TASS -- "The state will fulfill its 
commitments to the defence industry," said First Vice-Premier 
Oleg Soskovets during his visit to the "Izhmash" plant today. 
"After the budget is endorsed, in the near future this might 
become a reality," he said. 
  According to Soskovets, the state intends to boost the 
development of more advanced technologies for the armed forces 
and advocate a liberal approach to the realisation of military 
exports. Soskovets pointed out that exporting weapons, the 
government will take into account political interests of the 
state, and the liberalisation of exports will be beneficial for 
manufacturers. 
  Soskovets pointed out that the government will offer defence 
enterprises an opportunity to independently work for exports. 
"However, the state does not intend to sell a number of military 
hardware constructed on the basis of absolutely new high tech, 
which affects the country's defence," Soskovets said.

nuclear tests. In connection with this it is envisaged that all 
Russian scientists will have left the nuclear test site in 
Semipalatinsk by the beginning of July. Incidentally, right now 
only 20 percent of the original number of servicing personnel 
remain at the site. This is insufficient to maintain the site 
properly and to ensure its security. [video shows dilapidated

captioned "Video material supplied by Moscow Office of TBS"] At 
the insistence of the Kazakhstani Air Force, helicopter flights 
over the nuclear facilities without a special permit are banned. 
The last authorized flight took place 13 February this year. 
  Despite the high level of radioactivity at the test site, 
the 
facilities are not being guarded. Furthermore, the local 
authorities are seriously considering setting up a livestock 
farm on the territory of the site. The military also fear that 
abandoned equipment and cables, which could constitute a 
radioactive hazard, may be removed by pilferers. An unexploded 
nuclear charge which remains in one of the galleries also 
presents a threat. It cannot be defused because there are no 
specialists, and it cannot be exploded. [161146] [video shows

  [Text] Kiev May 13 TASS -- The process of dismantling and 
pullout of nuclear warheads from Ukraine into Russia is under 
full control and goes ahead as scheduled. A total of 180 
warheads had been removed from Ukraine to the Russian Federation 
by now, said Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk in an interview 
with ITAR-TASS at an opening ceremony of the Kiev spring fair on 
Friday. 
  "It is no secret for anyone that combat nuclear missiles 
stationed on the Ukrainian territory were not under Ukraine's 
control since the `nuclear button' was in Moscow. Besides, 
Ukraine never sought to take possession of such dangerous 
weapons," the Ukrainian president said. He confirmed Ukraine's 
intention to implement in full a tripartite agreement signed by 
the Russian, Ukrainian and the U.S. presidents at the beginning 
of 1994. 
  "We signed the agreement, hoping that other nuclear 
countries 
would take adequate measures and begin disarmament," Kravchuk 
said. He pointed out that according to information at his 
disposal the United States intends to make large-scale cuts of 
their nuclear arsenals, fulfilling agreements reached during the 
Moscow meeting. 
  He went on to say that by the end of May all American 
missiles targeted at Ukraine would be re-coded. "The time comes 
when our countries will really switch over from words of 
friendship and cooperation to concrete deeds," he said.

  [Text] A ceremonial signing of a memorandum on mutual 
understanding between the governments of Ukraine and the United 
States of America about the transfer of the missile equipment 
and technologies took place in the White House. Ukraine's 
Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and U.S. Vice President Al 
Gore signed the document. 
  Proceeding from common interest in maintaining and 
consolidating international peace and security, says the 
document, the governments of both countries are ready to jointly 
counteract the proliferation of the missile equipment and 
technologies which could contribute to the elaboration of 
acquisition of the missile systems for delivering mass 
annihilation weapons. 
  The memorandum envisages a package of measures aimed at 
strict control over the proliferation of missile technologies, 
the carrying out of joint inspections and consultations in this 
field, exchange of relevant data in case missile equipment and 
technologies are transferred. 
  Meanwhile, the memorandum emphasizes that the regime of 
control over the missile technologies rules out the creation of 
obstacles in the way of creating Ukraine's national space 
program or its cooperation with other missile and space states 
in this sphere. 
  By signing this document the United States of America, as a 
matter of fact, recognized Ukraine's just interests in 
preserving and further promoting scientific, technological and 
production capacity of Ukraine in the missile and space field. 
This agreement also means that Ukraine is recognized as an 
equal participant in international cooperation and a subject of 
the world aerospace market. 
  The second important result of the work done by the 
Ukrainian 
delegation, led by Valeriy Shmarov, in the U.S. capital was the 
adoption of a joint statement in which the governments of both 
countries reaffirm their loyalty to building relations of 
partnership, mutual trust and respect, and further developing 
new relations in the cause of security and defense. 
  Recognizing Ukraine's positive contribution to the cause of 
nuclear disarmament, the specific steps toward deactivating 
missile installations in Ukraine and the implementation of the 
trilateral statement as a whole, the Government of the United 
States of America, in response, announced that after 30 May this 
year the U.S. strategic missiles will no longer be targeted at 
Ukraine. 
  This document also emphasizes that as from this date the 
U.S. 
missiles will not be targeted at the territories of other 
countries, which will testify to the lessening of nuclear threat 
in the world as a whole. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony in the White House, U.S. 
Vice President Al Gore underlined that by its actions in many 
fields over the year Ukraine has proved that it is a reliable 
and responsible partner. 
  The adoption and signing of these important 
Ukrainian-American documents is yet another concrete step toward 
fulfilling the program of a broad development of bilateral 
relations signed by the presidents of Ukraine and the USA Leonid 
Kravchuk and Bill Clinton. An agreement was achieved on further 
contacts between both sides. 
  On behalf of the president and the government of our state 
Valeriy Shmarov invited the U.S. Vice President to visit Ukraine 
at a time convenient to him. The invitation was accepted with 
gratitude.

<F P=106> [Jean-Paul Croize report: "Nuclear Explosions Inside </F>
Computers"] 
  [Text] When the military planning law for the period 
1995-2000 was presented, it was revealed that between now and 
the end of the century more than 10 billion French francs [Fr] 
are to be invested in developing a highly-sophisticated system 
for simulating nuclear explosions. This is a major scientific 
decision since it will enable experts at the French Arms 
Delegation (DGA) and the Atomic Energy Commission [AEC] -- who 
have been pondering the design of such a system since 1991 in 
the framework of the Palen program (for the preparation and 
limitation of nuclear testing) -- to devise new methods for 
performing heavy-duty studies and experiments. Notable 
developments include extremely powerful lasers and 
high-performance computers which would also have considerable 
benefits for the civil domain. 
  While it is hard to imagine, the means do exist for 
simulating or partially reconstructing the diabolical energy 
release that is characterized by the triggering of a 
thermonuclear bomb. Better still, while the most complex means 
of simulation are still confined to the realms of theory, 
certain others already exist in concrete form. In two decades 
these resources have reduced the annual number of real nuclear 
tests carried out on the Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean from 
a dozen to just five, before the total test ban moratorium was 
imposed in April 1992. 
  The equipment already used in a number of Defense Ministry 
research centers make it possible to reconstruct some of the 
main mechanical or electromagnetic effects of a nuclear 
explosion, such as the blast, the heat wave, and the high-energy 
radiation flux that is generated. One of the simplest 
simulation tools to design -- but still delicate to use and 
particularly impressive to see in action -- is the giant blast 
tunnel at Grammat in the Lot region of France. Some 110 mt long 
and 12 mt wide, this structure, camouflaged to blend into the 
countryside, makes it possible to subject different types of 
military equipment to a very violent and instantaneous 
pressurization caused by the release in less than one-hundredth 
of a second of 300,000 lt of air stored in giant compressors. 
This involves generating eight million times the normal 
atmospheric pressure, equivalent to the shock wave of a 
thermonuclear explosion, which, in the tunnel, sweeps jeeps 
aside like mere wisps of straw. 
  Another, less spectacular example but equipment that is 
doubtless even more complex to use, is the "radiation chamber" 
that has been built in the Vernon ballistics and aerodynamics 
research laboratory. This tool -- the only one of its kind in 
Europe -- makes it possible to subject all types of electronic 
components to the kind of intense electromagnetic flash 
generated by an atomic bomb. 
  However, scientists have yet to implement the most difficult 
type of nuclear simulation: reconstructing the processes that 
lie at the heart of the explosion and which, in a few hundredths 
of a second, cause matter to change into other, lighter, atomic 
elements, generating an enormous amount of energy in the 
process. To improve the effectiveness of existing weapons and 
to design new ones -- like the famous neutron bombs -- it is 
vital to be able to accurately predict the operational 
effectiveness of various kinds of architecture and to select one 
material in preference to another. As a result it is essential 
to have "keys" composed either of real tests or a series of 
physical simulations and calculations using codes detailed 
enough to accurately determine by "virtual" means the way in 
which this energy will be released and then dispersed. 
  If they are to pinpoint the actual transmutation of elements 
during an atomic explosion, scientists in the AEC's military 
applications department will have to develop the two tools that 
are essential for any nuclear simulation: power lasers and 
massively parallel computers. The credits awarded for this task 
for the five years covered by the military planning law far 
exceed those currently allocated: the decision to invest a sum 
of Fr10 billion practically multiplies tenfold the budget for 
the Palen program which this year stands at Fr300 million. 
  On the computing level this will be enough to provide 
considerable stimulus for the work being done in France in the 
field of so-called "massively parallel" computing: using 
machines whose architecture is such that they can perform 
simultaneous rather than successive calculations interactively 
-- i.e. in parallel. This technology is still in its infancy, 
but it appears to be the only way of processing the phenomenal 
amount of data (people are talking of several hundred billion 
instructions per second) that this type of simulation requires 
-- even harder to do, say the experts, than atmospheric modeling. 
  Mastering such computing power, the experts claim, could 
only 
benefit the resource-hungry calculations used in weather 
forecasting and computer-assisted aircraft design. 
  In the field of lasers, the Palen program would enable 
France 
to build tools performing better than Phebus, the most powerful 
device currently being used by the AEC in Limeil, near Paris. 
Capable of delivering power of almost 10 kilojoules for about a 
billionth of a second, this would already be enough to light 
veritable miniature suns heating minuscule samples of matter to 
over 10 million degrees. The matter would then be converted into 
plasma such as is found in the core of a thermonuclear weapon. 
A major line of research in future years will consist of 
designing a system for amplifying the flashes emitted by such 
types of equipment to exceed the performance of the American 
"Nova," currently the most powerful laser in the world that can 
put out around 50 kilojoules in flashes of light emitted in a 
single time period of around one nanosecond. 
  In the civil domain, tools such as this would make it easier 
to examine the technology needed to master continuous fusion, 
i.e. generated in reactors that can supply infinitely more 
energy than existing atomic power stations. However, if we are 
to believe many military experts, several more real nuclear 
tests are needed to perfectly calibrate their data with the 
processes that occur inside a real bomb.

  [Text] France will not resume its nuclear tests even after 
1995. This sentence uttered by Francois Mitterrand at the 
Elysee sounds like a promise, a determination and a political 
testament. The head of state this afternoon extended an 
invitation to all French figures concerned with defense affairs 
and nuclear issues. Addressing his guests, among whom were 
Defense Minister Francois Leotard and the chiefs-of-staff of the 
three armed services, the president, standing between the French 
and European flags, thus made the promise that nuclear tests 
would no longer be carried out in France: [begin recording] 
  Mitterrand: No other tests will take place before 
May 1995, that is before a year from now. I know that a good 
dialectician... [pauses] It is said that this is not very 
important because this decision is not dangerous if taken within 
a year; the decision will be taken as soon as Mitterrand is 
gone! Let me say this to you, ladies and gentlemen: Nobody will 
do it after me! Nobody will do it, unless of course, another 
nuclear power starts its tests. I have already said that we 
will not do it because France would not like to see the French 
people and the whole world come to harm by re-launching a 
nuclear arms race, thus holding the third world and all the poor 
countries up to ridicule. Nor would France like to be the 
country that puts nuclear war on the map again. [end recording].

Leotard has said he thinks that nuclear tests should continue. 
The defense minister restated this before the finance select

disagreement with Francois Mitterrand who yesterday afternoon 
reaffirmed his determination to maintain the moratorium on 
French nuclear testing.

  [Excerpts] The topic everyone is discussing this morning is 
the one which Francois Mitterrand has just relaunched concerning 
nuclear testing. At the Elysee [president's office] yesterday 
the head of state in fact expressed great firmness over the 
costs, reaffirming his opposition to any resumption of nuclear 
testing. The statement has been well received by the Left, but 
criticized by the Right. [passage omitted] 
  Without being totally opposed to the head of state, [Foreign 
Minister] Alain Juppe is less convinced: the refusal to resume 
testing threatens the entire nuclear deterrent system, the 
foreign minister believes: [begin recording] 
Juppe: We need a credible and adequate deterrent 
force. It exists today; will it exist in 10 years' time? We are 
not certain of that, because it has to be modernized, and in 
order to modernize it many experts, in fact most experts, 
consider that further nuclear testing will be necessary, before 
computer simulation makes it possible for us to do without it. 
The president of the republic has taken up a position. That is 
his right, no one contests his position as head of the armed 
forces up until the end of his mandate. But he cannot 
anticipate what his successor will do. It is for the future 
president of the republic in May 1995 to explain to the French 
people what his concept of the matter is. [end recording] 
  That was Alain Juppe, who was the guest of Annette Ardisson 
just now at 0820 on France-Inter.

  [Text] Paris, May 6 (AFP) -- The question of whether to 
continue with nuclear tests is a "major point of disagreement" 
between the conservative French government and socialist 
President Francois Mitterrand, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said 
on French radio Friday. 
  In a review of French defence strategy Thursday evening, 
Mitterrand told defence chiefs the current moratorium on testing 
nuclear warheads would remain as long as he was president. 
Mitterrand's mandate ends next May. 
  Throwing a defiant challenge to any successor, almost 
certain 
to be a right-winger, he said future presidents would not dare 
to resume testing for fear of offending the whole world by 
relaunching the nuclear arms race, and urged them to move to 
computer-simulated tests. 
  Juppe, responding on France-Inter radio, said the issue was 
"a major point of disagreement" with the government, which wants 
to keep its options open. 
  No one questioned Mitterrand's authority as head of the 
armed 
forces until the end of the mandate, but "he cannot anticipate 
what his successor will do," the minister commented. "It is for 
the future president (...) to explain his vision to the French 
people." 
  As for computer-generated tests, "most experts think further 
nuclear tests are needed" before this was possible," he added. 
  A conservative member of parliament's defence committee used 
stronger language, saying Friday that Mitterrand was making a 
"vain testament, a farewell to arms" rather than showing a 
"vision of the future." 
  The president "remains strangely faithful to an outmoded 
vision of the bipolar world of the Cold War, without taking 
account of the new unpredictable dangers which we should defend 
ourselves against," said Jacques Baumel, from the ruling 
coalition party Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR). 
  Juppe said he agreed with the broad thrust of the 
president's 
arguments. 
  This was that it was vital to French interests to maintain 
an 
independent nuclear deterrent and keep out of NATO's military 
command, to allocate more money to computer research and 
strengthen overall disarmament, he said. 
  "There is no question today of rejoining the military 
organisation" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, said 
Juppe, who said development of computer simulation "will allow 
us to move on from nuclear tests one day." 
  Mitterrand, speaking to military and civilian defence chiefs 
at his Elysee palace after the adoption of a bill setting out 
France's defence strategy for the next six years, had said 
French nuclear weapons would remain "under sole French control." 
  He said he stood by the late president Charles de Guaulle's 
1966 decision to pull out of NATO's military command. "I firmly 
maintain this decision. Nothing will make me change it," he 
said. 
  Mitterrand also gave the first-ever official details of his 
country's nuclear arsenal, saying France had some 500 nuclear 
warheads. 
  The deterrent relied mainly on five nuclear-powered 
submarines which each carried 16 missiles with six independently 
targeted warheads. The number in service at any one time was 64 
missiles, carrying a total of 384 warheads, each of 150 
kilotonnes yield, Mitterrand said.

<F P=106> [Article by Dominique Garraud: "Mitterrand: `After Me, No </F>
More Nuclear Tests'"] 
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, the head of state reaffirmed his 
primacy regarding defense matters by issuing a statement 
opposing any resumption of nuclear tests. In his opinion, the 
next president of the Republic will have to maintain the 
moratorium, for "France will not want to offend the world." 
  Francois Mitterrand has an acute sense of provocation. 
Yesterday, in an unprecedented move, the head of state gathered 
in the banqueting hall of the Elysee [presidential palace] 200 
people directly concerned with the nuclear deterrent, including 
army commanders, industrialists, scientists, members of 
Parliament, and ministers. With the exception of Jean-Pierre 
Chevenement, all his former defense ministers were there, as 
well as current Defense Minister Francois Leotard. However, 
there was no Edouard Balladur, who was elsewhere, officially for 
obscure reasons regarding the use of time. [passage omitted] 
  As the guardian of a De Gaullian dogma regarding deterrence, 
Francois Mitterrand reaffirmed the pillars thereof: "The key 
aim of deterrence is to avoid war by safeguarding the integrity 
of national territory and ensuring the defense of our vital 
interests," he professed. As for the notion of the "final 
warning" which emerged in the sixties, it is a "terminal 
warning" which must not be led astray and become some kind of 
"nuclear artillery." 
  Looking at Francois Leotard, the head of state proved 
menacing on the subject of the government's majority. "Mr. 
Defense Minister, you intend to tell the National Assembly that 
it should provide itself with the means of response or attack 
against the weak or crazy. Should we use nuclear weapons 
outside our territory or apart from our vital interests? Must 
we rally to the adherents of the surgical, or even decapitating, 
nuclear strike? And why not a nuclear gun? To me that would 
seem to be a major heresy. There is no way I will accept it. 
And if an amendment in this sense came to be adopted, it would 
lead to a major conflict which the French people would have to 
decide on." Clearly, he was threatening to dissolve the 
Assembly. 
  The paradox is that this risk would appear to be 
infinitesmal. While Edouard Balladur remains very discreet on 
these issues, Francois Leotard will mark his opposition to any 
measure that would result in nuclear weapons becoming an 
everyday feature. And in the Assembly, the committed proponents 
of decapitating nuclear strikes, led by RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] member Jacques Baumel, can be counted on the fingers 
of one hand. 
  By stating his views ceremoniously, Francois Mitterrand 
reiterated that nothing concerning the policy of nuclear 
deterrence can be done without him. In passing, he will 
certainly trigger several skirmishes within the government's 
majority against the excessive lenience supposedly shown by 
Edouard Balladur toward the president. 
  The provocative aspect of Francois Mitterrand's speech is 
not 
insignificant just before the parliamentary debate on defense 
issues. However, yesterday's exercise will go much further than 
the end of the upcoming parliamentary debate. "The movement 
calling for nuclear disarmament is healthy," said Francois 
Mitterrand, voicing his support for a renewal of the nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and a "universal, verifiable" 
treaty banning tests. And that will not necessarily be the 
vision of the next president of the Republic, especially if his 
name is Jacques Chirac.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nuclear Testing: Balladur Disagrees </F>
With Mitterrand"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday closed the 
48th session of the IHEDN [National Institute for High-Level 
Studies] at the French Military School with a speech in which he 
stated his views on defense. The text of his speech revealed 
that he does not share the views of the president of the 
Republic with regard to nuclear deterrent policy. 
  The prime minister did not rule out "the possible restart of 
nuclear testing, depending on the international situation and 
the behavior of the other nuclear powers," stressing that 
"France never agreed to link the suspension of its nuclear 
testing with the negotiation" of the Complete Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT). Mr. Balladur explained that this possible restart of 
testing and "our involvement in the negotiation" of the treaty 
"were not therefore incompatible." The prime minister reiterated 
that, on 13 October, he had told the National Assembly that the 
government "would not subscribe to any definitive ban on testing 
as long as it felt such testing was essential to the technical 
credibility of our deterrent force." 
<H5>  `Threshold' Countries </H5>
  With these words, Mr. Balladur set himself apart from the 
stance taken on nuclear testing by Mr. Mitterrand last Thursday. 
In a speech to 200 guests, including representatives of the 
military establishment and arms manufacturers, the head of state 
assured his audience that "for as long as he remained in office, 
there would be no further testing." He also said he was 
convinced that "after [he had gone], they would not [restart 
testing] because France will not want to offend the whole world 
by restarting the arms race." He added: "I have confidence in 
my successors; they will not be able to do otherwise," 
implicitly referring to the upcoming diplomatic deadlines of the 
revision of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995 and the 
conclusion of a test ban treaty expected shortly afterwards. 
  The prime minister also asked that the "threshold" countries 
(those on the verge of acquiring nuclear arms) should 
participate in the drawing up of the CTBT, something that is not 
currently envisaged. Edouard Balladur considered that the 
"forum for negotiation, which must be multilateral, should 
immediately involve the threshold countries." He continued: 
"It is very important for the disarmament conference to extend 
as far as possible so that all threshold countries are 
represented." With regard to the implementation of the treaty, 
Mr. Balladur warned that it could only take effect if the 
threshold countries also ratified it. 
  While the chairman of the committee charged with drawing up 
the text for this complete test ban after the winter session of 
the disarmament conference said at the end of March that this 
treaty could be ready by 1995, Mr. Balladur emphasized that 
"there was absolutely no fixed deadline for the conclusion" of 
the treaty which is to "settle numerous and complex" issues. 
The prime minister added that the government would refuse "in 
particular that the extension of the NPT at the May 1995 
conference were dependent on the conclusion of a CTBT." He 
warned: "The failure to extend the NPT could place question 
marks over our commitment to a test ban treaty." 
<H5>  Conscription To Remain </H5>
  In addition, Edouard Balladur considered that the mixed-army 
system was "certainly not designed to be inflexible," even if, 
"in the short- to medium-term, the Armed Forces cannot do 
without conscription." Mr. Balladur continued: "The government 
has made choices for the foreseeable future, some 15 years 
hence," and he considered it "high likely" that "the system will 
evolve in one direction or another after that time." Where the 
"modalities of this evolution" were concerned, the prime 
minister said that he thought it was "wiser to firstly implement 
the military programming law (...) before trying to imagine 
future changes." 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister stressed that he "did not 
believe" that a professional Army would "be sufficient to meet 
French defense obligations and ambitions." He said: "France 
has ambitions and responsibilities far beyond its national 
borders (...) which require a large [defense system]." He 
pointed out that a professional Army not only posed the question 
of structural coherence in view of missions, but also of human 
resources and cost. 
  With regard to staffing levels, Mr. Balladur estimated that 
some 48,000 men would have to be hired every year if 
conscription were to be abolished. He noted that the United 
Kingdom had "problems recruiting 28,000 men per year." With 
regard to cost, he explained that if forces were reduced by 20 
percent as a result of total professionalization, there would be 
"annual additional expenditure of 20 to 25 billion francs." He 
added: "Thus, unless the defense budget were increased together 
with levy on national wealth, abolishing conscription would lead 
to a drastic reduction in the size of the Armed Forces."

<F P=106> [By Vienna-based correspondent Cha Man-sun] </F>
  [Text] With the approaching deadline for submitting a 
report on the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security 
Council, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] again 
notified North Korea, as it did previously, that it will send an 
inspection team as soon as North Korea allows the sampling of 
spent fuel when nuclear fuel is replaced. 
  In a message sent to North Korea early this morning, the 
IAEA 
reminded North Korea that the deadline for submitting a report 
to the UN Security Council is approaching, and stated that even 
though the inspection on the replacement of fuel rods has been 
delayed considerably, it will send an inspection team around 
this weekend if North Korea accepts the IAEA proposal by this 
week. 
  The IAEA expects North Korea to show a positive response 
this 
week or early next week depending on the result of the recent 
contacts with the United States. However, in case North Korea 
shows a negative response, including the replacement of nuclear 
fuel on its own, the IAEA's position is that a report to the UN 
Security Council will be inevitable.

  [Text] Vienna, May 11 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) has asked North Korean experts to visit 
Vienna for talks on replacing fuel rods in a nuclear reactor, 
the agency announced Wednesday [11 May]. 
  In addition, agency inspectors would visit North Korea "in 
the next few days" if the replacement of the rods in the Yonbyon 
reactor was postponed, the IAEA said in a statement. 
  U.S. officials say the change of fuel rods could provide 
enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear weapons. 
  The IAEA has been insisting on not only witnessing the fuel 
change but also on sampling the used fuel to determine whether 
the Stalinist country has diverted fissile material for weapons. 
  IAEA director general Hans Blix proposed to North Korean 
Foreign Minister Kim Young-Nam in a telex message that North 
Korea send a team of experts to Vienna to discuss these measures 
and the timetable for replacement of the rods, the statement 
said. 
  "In the meantime, on the assumption that the core discharge 
is deferred, the IAEA proposes to send an inspection team in the 
next few days." 
  "This team is to carry out the activities which the IAEA was 
not able to implement during the inspection in March at the 
reprocessing plant." 
  Blix reaffirmed in the telex that it was very important to 
take samples from the fuel rods of a five-megawatt nuclear 
reactor at Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers (56 miles) north of 
Pyongyang, to measure their radioactivity levels. 
  But the IAEA chief suggested that the actual testing of the 
fuel rods could be carried out "in the second half of this 
year," a spokesman for South Korea's foreign ministry said in 
Seoul. 
  The Blix message was an answer to the North Korean foreign 
minister's proposal on Friday that Pyongyang could negotiate 
with the IAEA over nuclear inspections and the presence of 
monitors to witness the fuel replacement. 
  The Blix message was made public in Seoul following 
unconfirmed South Korean press reports that Washington had 
agreed to resume high-level talks with North Korea in return for 
the sampling of the fuel rods at a later date. 
  The IAEA also said its team could finish inspecting a 
radiochemical laboratory, from which IAEA inspectors were barred 
by North Koreans last March, and check surveillance equipments 
at various nuclear facilities. 
  In Vienna, IAEA spokesman David Kyd said the inspectors 
could 
leave for North Korea any time from Saturday if the response 
from Pyongyang was positive.

  [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) announced Tuesday [10 May] that it will 
send inspectors "in the next few days" to North Korea to 
complete monitoring activities begun in March. 
  Dispatch of the inspectors is conditioned on North Korea 
delaying the removal of fuel rods from its 5-megawatt reactor, 
according to a letter from IAEA Director-General Hans Blix 
addressed to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam. 
  The agency invited North Korea to send a delegation of 
experts to Vienna to discuss the inspection timetable. 
  Blix said he hopes the IAEA and the delegation can negotiate 
the necessary inspection process for the changing of the fuel 
rods. 
  The director-general emphasized in the letter that the rods 
must remain closed under IAEA seals after they are randomly 
selected, and various measurements of the rods should be 
conducted late this year, officials said. 
  The letter offers hope of a breakthrough in the nuclear 
impasse since the IAEA proposal, although it carries a 
condition, leaves aside for now the biggest stumbling block to 
an inspection agreement.

sometime on 17 May. He said that the inspection team will 
confirm whether North Korea has just started regular preparation 
measures to replace the fuel rods at the five megawatt-class 
atomic reactor or it has already reached "a serious stage" of 
carrying out the replacement work such as unloading the nuclear 
rods. He added that the inspection team is scheduled to stay in 
North Korea for eight days, but that their stay there may be 
extended.

  The three-member inspection team, led by IAEA inspection 
chief (Hainamen), left for Vienna via China on the evening of 15 
May, Korean standard time, and is due to arrive in Beijing at 
0840 on 16 May. 
  The inspection team, entrusted with the special mission to 
make on-the-spot confirmation of the nuclear fuel rods 
replacement, will make a stopover in Beijing and arrive in 
Pyongyang via Koryo Civilian Air on the afternoon of 17 May. 
  During its stay, the inspection team will confirm on the 
spot 
whether nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon 
have actually been replaced. The IAEA will call off its 
inspection and pull out its team earlier than scheduled if North 
Korea has removed the nuclear fuel rods seals and replaced the 
nuclear fuel rods. However, if North Korea has just begun 
preparations for the nuclear fuel rods replacement, the 
inspection team will carry out inspection activities until 24 
May. It will check seals and replace surveillance equipment at 
major nuclear facilities, and conduct additional inspections of 
the radiochemical laboratory.

  [Text] A clue to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue 
is hard to come by because North Korea rejects fuel rods 
inspections. It has been learned, however, that China is playing 
an active mediating role. 
  Zhang Tingyan, Chinese ambassador to the ROK, visited Vice 
Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong today and reportedly told him 
that the Chinese Government is actively engaged in persuading 
North Korea and requested that the Governments of the ROK and 
the United States deal with the North Korean claims with 
flexibility. 
  Ambassador Zhang Tingyan reportedly said that, according to 
what the Chinese Government has found out, North Korea has not 
replaced the fuel rods yet and asked that negotiations to 
resolve the nuclear issue continue. Ambassador Zhang Tingyan's 
visit to the Foreign Ministry was made at the request of the 
Chinese side so he would explain the contact between the North 
Korean and Chinese Governments. 
  Because it has been revealed that the Chinese Government is 
actively mediating between North Korea, the ROK, and the United 
States, negotiations over the nuclear issue, which have run into 
difficulties because of the North Korean refusal to replace and 
safekeep fuel rods, are likely to reach a compromise without 
dashing toward a catastrophe. 
  Meanwhile, the ROK and the United States are said to be 
planning to propose to North Korea that the matter of fuel rods 
inspection, which North Korea rejects, be solved at the third 
round of U.S.- North Korean talks without making issue of it any 
more at the present stage. 
  It has been reported that the ROK and the United States are 
planning to disclose their position to begin additional 
inspections and technological inspections on North Korea around 
the end of this week and to hold the third round of U.S.-North 
Korean talks immediately after that.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on Japan's decision to postpone the plutonium utility 
program. 
  The news analyst says: 
  Japan's measure does not mean abandoning the plutonium 
utility program but postponing the construction of a new 
plutonium production facility. 
  Japan's abrupt decision to postpone the program is a crafty 
ruse to convince the world public of its non-nuclear will, avoid 
international criticism and isolation and create a favorable 
climate for holding a permanent membership in the U.N. Security 
Council. 
  The decision came in the wake of Japan's calculation that 
the 
postponement of the construction of a new plutonium production 
facility will do no harm to its nuclear arms development. 
  Japan's efforts to convert itself into a military power and 
arm itself with nuclear weapons are based on revanchism. 
  The Japanese ruling quarters obsessed with the ambition to 
lord it over in the international arena as a military and 
political power regard nuclear armament as an inevitable means 
to carry into practice their ambition. 
  With no trick can the Japanese authorities conceal their 
ambition for nuclear armament. 
  Japan must give up nuclear armament, mindful that this will 
lead to its own destruction.

  [Text] Another working-level contact between North Korea 
and the United States for the settlement of the North Korean 
nuclear [issue] was held in New York early this morning, three 
days after the previous contact. 
  The contact was held after North Korea had announced it 
would 
allow International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. 
The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from 
New York: [begin recording] 
  Nam: The United States and North Korea had a chief 
and counselor-level working contact for over an hour early this 
morning to discuss allowing additional inspections [chuga 
sachal] and the third round of high-level talks. 
  As the contact was held only a few days after the previous 
contact on Tuesday and right after the IAEA's announcement of 
its decision to send an inspection team, a well-informed source 
said that this implies that a breakthrough will be provided soon 
through U.S.-North Korea negotiations. 
  The source said that there had been very positive contents 
in 
today's working-level contact noting that the United States 
reiterated its position on the inspection of fuel rods, which 
was also mentioned in the previous contact, and that North Korea 
responded to this. 
  During today's working-level contact, the United States 
urged 
that additional inspections should be properly conducted and 
stressed that the schedule of the third-round high-level talks 
should be discussed in the course of observing the development 
of inspections. North Korea reportedly demanded to hold the 
third- round talks as soon as possible since additional 
inspections and regular inspections [chonggi sachal] will be 
conducted. 
  The two sides reportedly decided to let the problem 
concerning inspections of fuel rods be technically solved 
between the IAEA and North Korea, and to hold another full-scale 
working-level contact on the third-round talks next week when 
inspections will be under way. [end recording]

  [Text] The North Korean mission to the United Nations said 
today that North Korea already started the work of replacing 
fuel rods at a 5-megawatt nuclear reactor without the presence 
of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. We have news 
by reporter Nam Son-hyon from New York. [begin recording] 
Nam: The North Korean mission to the United Nations 
said that it sent a telex to IAEA Director General Hans Blix on 
13 May in the name of Pak Yong-man, director of North Korean 
Atomic Energy General Department, officially notifying him that 
North Korea had started to replace fuel rods at the nuclear 
power plant [wonjaryok palchonsoe yonryobong kyochechakopi 
sichaktoeumul]. 
  According to the telex message sent by Pak Yong-nam, 
specially obtained by KBS, North Korea noted that from late 
April to early this month, it had notified the IAEA on four 
occasions that it could no longer delay the replacement of fuel 
rods. North Korea said that it regrets that it could no longer 
delay the replacement of fuel rods at the nuclear reactor 
because of technical and safety problems [kisuljogurona 
anjonsangmunjerona to isang kyochechakopul mirulsuopssu]. 
  Director Pak Yong-nam said in the telex message: In spite of 
the special status [tuksuhan chiwiaraesodo] with the IAEA, North 
Korea has provided sufficient conditions to guarantee the 
continuity of safeguards regarding the replacement of fuel rods, 
but the IAEA Secretariat did not respond to North Korea's good 
will [sonuijogin yogu], and instead put forward unreasonable 
conditions [pudanghan chogonul]. 
  North Korea said, however, that there are many opportunities 
for future negotiations regarding the issue because it just 
began the work, and stressed that if the IAEA shows its fair 
position, North Korea could allow the IAEA to choose and keep 
[sontaekkwa pogwan] fuel rods while they are being replaced. It 
also said that the future negotiations would be more productive 
when they are held at the place near the area where the work of 
replacing fuel rods is being started. 
  North Korea added in the telex message that it believes that 
it is fortunate that the IAEA has decided, though belatedly, to 
send the inspection team to Pyongyang and that it is ready to 
accept the inspection activities of an experimental nuclear 
power plant and a radiochemical laboratory, as mentioned 
earlier. [end recording]

  [Text] It has been learned that China recently sent an 
official warning message to North Korea urging it not to change 
nuclear fuel rods by itself without the presence of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and to allow 
additional inspections by the IAEA at the earliest possible date. 
  In particular, China sternly warned that changing nuclear 
fuel rods on North Korea's own would be a definite violation of 
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and would result not only in 
terrifying denunciation from the international community, but 
also in making sanctions against North Korea inevitable. 
  The above was revealed by a high-level diplomatic source in 
Beijing on 12 May who added: "The strong warning from China was 
an important motive behind North Korea's recent announcement to 
allow the additional inspections by the IAEA and to postpone the 
changing of nuclear fuel rods.

<F P=106> ["Nuclear Culprit Caught Red-handed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- 70 kg of unregistered 
plutonium in pure powder was discovered recently at a reactor of 
the Tokai nuclear fuel plant of Japan. 
  Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today brands this case as 
a 
product of conspiracy among Japan, the International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] which had carried out its inspection and 
the United States which had manipulated the IAEA. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The hiding of plutonium by Japan shows there is a grave 
problem in IAEA inspections and nuclear non-proliferation. 
  The hypocrisy of Japan, a double-dealer, has been stripped 
naked and its wild ambition to become a nuclear power exposed as 
a stark fact. 
  It has been proved that the Japanese Government's persistent 
pressure on the DPRK over the "nuclear issue" was a despicable 
drama to conceal its criminal nuclear arms development. 
  Facts clearly show Japan is a culprit who deliberately 
violated the Non-proliferation Treaty. 
  The plutonium concealment also causes grave doubt as to the 
impartiality of IAEA inspections. 
  The IAEA had said the nuclear facilities of Japan were under 
its strict inspections, but had never reported that there was a 
problem. 
  While closing its eye to Japan concealing a large amount of 
plutonium, the IAEA has faked up "suspicion of nuclear 
programme" of the DPRK and framed every conceivable intrigues to 
have "sanctions" taken at the United Nations organisation. This 
is an act contrary to the basic mission of the IAEA and the 
culmination of its application of a double standard. 
  This eloquently proves that the IAEA is rather used as a 
shameful political tool of the superpower than performing its 
duty and mission. 
  The United States is also involved in the problem. The U.S. 
Government, aware of Japan's concealment of plutonium, has kept 
silence and connived at Japan's nuclear development. 
  It is shameless of the United States to hurl mud at the 
peaceful nuclear activities of the DPRK that offer no problem 
and threaten it with the use of arms such as "preemptive strike" 
while keeping mum about Japan's concealment of plutonium, a big 
problem. 
  This shows the United States does not intend to prevent the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons but is using the nuclear issue 
for a sinister political purpose. 
  Japan must frankly open to the public the whole amount of 
plutonium it has stockpiled in secrecy and give up the nuclear 
armament programme. 
  The IAEA must observe the principle of impartiality in 
accordance with its mission. 
  The United States must refrain from using the nuclear issue 
for a sinister political purpose against the DPRK and from 
applying the double standard.

  [Text] Washington, May 13 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
already begun changing nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
reactor in Yongbyon without the supervision of International 
Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspectors. 
  In a telex message sent to IAEA headquarters in Vienna on 
Thursday, North Korea also said it was prepared to allow 
additional IAEA inspections of a key radiochemical laboratory. 
  Despite the latest development, the IAEA plans to send a 
team 
of inspectors on Sunday to check the radiochemical laboratory 
and service surveillance equipment in other facilities, IAEA 
spokesman David Kyd said in Vienna Friday. 
  The agency had insisted that its inspectors must be present 
when North Korea changes nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt 
reactor. The IAEA said it would send inspectors only when 
Pyongyang postponed the refueling. 
  Nevertheless, the U.N. nuclear watchdog has decided to 
dispatch inspectors in the apparent belief that North Korea has 
not yet removed the fuel rods from the reactor, informed sources 
here said. 
  The United States has also said it would suspend dialogue 
with North Korea if it changed the fuel rods without an IAEA 
presence. But the sources said Washington will now decide 
whether to hold a third round of high-level talks after learning 
the outcome of the IAEA inspections. 
  State Department deputy spokesman David Johnson said 
Washington was not in a position to comment on further talks 
with North Korea until it heard from the IAEA on the result of 
the upcoming inspections. The IAEA alone must determine whether 
the continuity of nuclear safeguards in North Korea has been 
maintained, Johnson said. Only then will the U.S. Government 
decide on the third round of negotiations. 
  What the United States is interested in right now is to 
choose the spent nuclear fuel rods at random and preserve them 
for later checks, said another State Department official, 
requesting anonymity. 
  Another diplomatic source here said "All is not clear at the 
moment" with regard to the changing of the nuclear fuel rods. 
However, it appears that North Korea has just begun preparations 
for refueling, rather than having taken fuel rods out of the 
reactor, he added. 
  The contents of Pyongyang's message to the IAEA will not 
influence the prospect for U.S.-North Korean talks, he said, 
adding that a firm evaluation of the overall situation will be 
made after the IAEA inspectors' visit. 
  Meanwhile, Pak Yong-nam, minister of the Atomic Energy 
Industry, said in the telex to the IAEA that North Korea was 
compelled to begin changing nuclear fuel rods because the IAEA 
had failed to send an inspection team, attaching unjustifiable 
conditions. 
  The message was addressed to IAEA Secretary-general Hans 
Blix. 
  Pyongyang nevertheless welcomed the IAEA's decision to send 
inspectors, though belatedly. North Korea will allow them to 
inspect its experimental nuclear power generating station and 
the radiochemical laboratory in order to maintain the continuity 
of nuclear safeguards, it said. 
  North Korea has also proposed resuming negotiations with the 
IAEA to resolve complicated problems with the refueling. 
  It would be more productive to hold the negotiations close 
to 
where the refueling is proceeding, it said, hinting that it 
wants to hold talks in Pyongyang. 
  Referring to the refueling, North Korea said work has just 
begun and that there would be many opportunities for the IAEA to 
collect the spent fuel rods at random and preserve them.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the recent discovery of 70 kilograms of pure 
plutonium enough for the manufacture of nine nuclear bombs at 
reactors of the fissionable material producing processes in the 
Tokaimura Atomic Industrial Centre, Japan. 
  The analyst says: 
  Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the 
production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the 
country were for "a peaceful purpose" and it would not lead to 
the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also 
boastfully claimed that it is "a model" in accepting inspections 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully 
revealed this time that all this was a lie. 
  The analyst continues: 
  Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled 
plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that 
it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a 
nuclear power under the cloak of "a peaceful purpose." 
  Broad public circles of the world have considered that 
Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to 
its design to become a nuclear power. 
  The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about 
"investigation" and "removal of misgivings." This is, however, a 
belated excuse. 
  Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing 
headlong toward nuclear armament. 
  Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and 
security in Asia and the rest of the world.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- Three inspectors from the 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Beijing on Monday [16 
May] on their way to monitor the refueling of a North Korean 
nuclear facility. 
  The team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency is 
scheduled to leave Beijing for Pyongyang on Tuesday and to begin 
inspection of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear plant at 
Yongbyon, near Pyongyang, on Wednesday. 
  Despite a North Korean announcement Saturday that it had 
removed seals and started replacing spent fuel rods at the 
reactor, the team will continue with a previous agreement and 
monitor the refueling process, team leader Olli Heinonen said. 
  An IAEA spokesman said Saturday in Vienna that if North 
Korea 
commits a serious violation of the nuclear safeguard agreement, 
such as removing seals from the fuel rod container, the team may 
suspend the scheduled inspections. 
  "We just want to check and see for ourselves and then we'll 
all be much wiser," Heinonen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in Beijing. 
  Heinonen, who has been to North Korea "many times," refused 
to comment on the nuclear situation there, nor would he comment 
on whether his team shares any concerns over North Korean safety 
precautions. 
  "We've been to many countries and we've seen many plants and 
many situations," he said. 
  The Yongbyon plant is at present supposedly undergoing its 
initial refueling, although U.S. intelligence reports say the 
plant may have been refueled in 1989. 
  The IAEA inspectors hope to verify whether refueling took 
place in 1989 and whether or not any of the spent fuel has been 
diverted to other uses, particularly military uses. 
  The IAEA team also hopes to inspect a laboratory that it was 
denied access to during an uncompleted inspection in March, 
Heinonen said. 
  Western countries suspect the lab is involved in a program 
to 
produce nuclear arms. 
  Heinonen said his team will collect as much data as possible 
and return "in about a week" to Vienna where the inspectors will 
formulate a report with other IAEA experts.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
announced that the IAEA inspection team, which entered North 
Korea yesterday [17 May], today arrived in Yongbyon, the site of 
inspection, and has begun inspection activities. 
  The inspection team will watch [kamsi] the work of replacing 
nuclear fuel rods in Yongbyon and conduct additional inspection 
of the radiochemical experimental power station. The United 
States and IAEA have high expectations for the inspection team's 
activities. 
  After arriving in Yongbyon today, the IAEA inspection team, 
composed of three inspectors, started the work of confirming 
whether fuel rods were replaced by examining surveillance 
cameras and seals installed in the nuclear reactor. 
  Even if North Korea has launched the work of replacing 
nuclear fuel rods, the IAEA will persuade North Korea through 
various negotiation channels to allow the inspection team to 
optionally select nuclear fuel rods from nuclear reactor at the 
initial stage of replacement and to store them in a separate 
special instrument. The reason for this is that if the 
inspection team takes a sample from storage house after the 
replacement of the fuel rods is completed, the team cannot 
examine the precise amount of nuclear material already converted. 
  The IAEA maintains that the sample-taking during the time of 
replacing the nuclear fuel rods is indispensable for deciding 
whether the North Korean report that damaged fuel rods were 
replaced only once since the operation began in 1986 is true or 
not and for finding out the exact quantity of fuel rods replaced. 
  Therefore, the IAEA inspection team will decide the extent 
of 
progress in the replacement of nuclear fuel rods and examine 
whether the precise sample-taking is feasible at the present 
stage or not. The inspection team is given a special mission to 
urgently report the result of its aforementioned activities. 
  Meanwhile, the Clinton administration has expectations for 
the result of the activities by the IAEA inspection team in 
North Korea. 
  During a regular briefing today, U.S. Defense Department 
spokesman (Box) expressed an optimistic view, stating that the 
inspection team will complete inspections of the seven declared 
nuclear facilities, which remained unsolved last March, and will 
go into the nuclear reactor in question in Yongbyon and replace 
film and batteries.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 (YONHAP) -- The 2nd economic committee 
of the Worker's (Nodong) Party, which is directly controlled by 
North Korean leader Kim Il-song and his son, Chong-il, is 
managing Pyongyang's nuclear development through enormous 
expenditures, a former North Korean worker at a uranium 
refinery, who defected to the South early this month, told a 
Japanese vernacular newspaper Friday. 
  "North Korea succeeded in extracting 12 kilograms of 
plutonium in 1988," 35-year-old Kim Tae-ho said in Seoul in an 
interview with the YOMIURI SHIMBUN. 
  On the surface, North Korea's nuclear program is seemingly 
under the control of the Atomic Energy Industry Ministry, but in 
fact it is managed by party Secretary Chon Pyong-ho, chief of 
the 2nd Economic Committee, Kim said. 
  The 2nd Economic Committee commands the logistics and atomic 
energy industries and the nuclear program is managed by its 
subordinate agency, called the 5th General Machinery Industry 
Bureau, he said. 
  All facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex are 
administered by the 5th Machinery Industry General Bureau and 
Economic Committee Chief Chon are operating them under direct 
instructions from Kim Il-song and his son. 
  Saying he had heard stories from several of his friends 
working as nuclear researchers, Kim told the YOMIURI that North 
Korea first succeeded in withdrawing plutonium from spent fuel 
in the 5-megawatt nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in the summer of 
1988. 
  "Kim Il-song and his son were so happy that they went down 
to 
the reactor and gave each of the researchers and engineers a 
color television receiver," he said. 
  The extracted plutonium was estimated to weigh 12 kilograms, 
sufficient to produce two nuclear bombs, Kim pointed out. "In 
light of North Korea's technology, they (North Koreans) have yet 
to produce nuclear bombs, but I think they are near completion, 
he said. 
  He said a military coup was attempted in a bid to overthrow 
the Kim Il-song regime early last year. It was led by Vice 
Marshal Kim Pong-yul and several generals who studied in the 
former Soviet Union. They were all captured after their coup 
plan was blocked by Army General Political Bureau Director Yi 
Pong-won, Kim said. 
  Before fleeing to South Korea, Kim worked at a uranium 
refinery in Pyongsan, North Hwanghae Province, which sends ore 
to a processing factory in Yongbyon. The ore is known to be 
processed into fuel rods for use at nuclear reactors.

<F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Urges Japanese Authorities </F>
To Declare Total Amount of its Plutonium" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK 
Foreign Ministry in a statement today regarding the discovery of 
70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making plant in 
Tokaimura, Japan, says this extra-large case is a breach of the 
publicly recognized international law which must be taken as a 
serious case and condemned. 
  "This vividly shows that Japan's much-touted `three 
non-nuclear principles' are a `screen' for stepping up nuclear 
armament in full scale while keeping a large amount of plutonium 
in hiding and that the noisy row Japan has raised over the 
fictitious `nuclear issue' of the DPRK, taking the van in the 
intrigues to stifle it, is a petty trick to conceal its own 
nuclear armament and divert the public attention elsewhere", the 
spokesman says. 
  He urges the Secretariat of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency to pay due attention to this problem in compliance with 
the principle of impartiality. 
  "The United States which has abused the `nuclear issue' of 
the DPRK for its sinister political purposes, talking about a 
`cooperation system' aimed at `stifling' the DPRK in league with 
Japan, a nuclear criminal, can never evade its responsibility 
for this case," he says, and goes on: 
  "The Japanese authorities must declare to the international 
community the exact total amount of plutonium they keep in 
hiding nationwide and immediately stop their nuclear armament. 
  "We consider the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula 
virtually meaningless since Japan's nuclear armament being 
promoted on the danger line has been verified in actuality. 
  "We call upon the governments of all countries in the world, 
international organizations and anti-nuke organizations to exert 
unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development 
from our planet and, in particular, to take a joint action 
against Japan's nuclear armament which is being accelerated 
recklessly with the ambition to become a military power, a 
nuclear power."

  [Text] Seoul, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong- ku on Tuesday regretted the remarks made recently by Kim 
Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, with 
respect to the North Korean nuclear question. 
  "I regret that chairman Kim made remarks of a kind not 
fitting to a government policy and our public sentiments, 
causing various problems," Yi said. 
  Kim is said to have stated during his stay in the United 
States that even if North Korea possesses several nuclear bombs, 
it doesn't pose any problem. 
  In a comment, Deputy Premier Yi who is also national 
unification minister said that if North Korea comes to have any 
nuclear arms, military and political balance between South and 
North Korea would be shattered outright, bringing about a 
serious problem to the national security of South Korea. 
  "Our government stand is that North Korea should not possess 
even a single nuclear weapon and that if they have any, it 
should be destroyed under all circumstances," Yi said. 
  The deputy prime minister also rejected as "improper" Kim 
Tae-chung's idea of inviting Kim Il-song to the United States 
and sending Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as 
a special envoy. 
  His proposition cannot be of any help to the government 
policy of resolving inter-Korean issues through talks between 
the direct parties involved, namely, South and North Korea, Yi 
said.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu called on North Korea Thursday to fulfill 
its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) 
and the inter-Korean denuclearization agreement. 
  An era of reconciliation and cooperation can begin only when 
North Korea embraces a policy of co-existence and cooperation, 
Han said in his keynote speech at the opening of an 
international seminar titled "Nuclear Policies in Northeast 
Asia." 
  The seminar opened at the Institute of Foreign Affairs and 
National Security (IFANS) under the joint sponsorship of the UN 
Institute for Disarmament Research (UNIDIR) in Seoul for a 
two-day run. 
  Over 60 experts from home and abroad are participating in 
the 
seminar including UNIDIR director Sverre Lodgaard, German 
Ambassador at large Josef Holik, Tokyo University Professor 
Takashi Inoguchi and a senior fellow at the China Institute of 
International Studies, Tan Han. 
  South Korea fully supports extension of the NPT beyond its 
scheduled expiration in 1995 and also favors strengthening the 
nuclear safeguards measures of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA), Han told the seminar. 
  The seminar is divided into four sections on the nuclear 
policies of Northeast Asia, the potential for nuclear 
proliferation, preventive action against such proliferation, and 
the nuclear policies of Russia, China, Japan, the United States 
and South and North Korea.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said the government's policy to build the fourth 
nuclear plant will not change despite overwhelming opposition to 
the plant by villagers who live near the proposed site. 
  Chiang said he was not surprised by the result of a public 
poll in Kungliao Sunday [22 May], and said he will ask the 
state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) to step up its dialogue 
and communication with people in Kungliao, a village some 35 km 
east of Taipei. 
  In a vote Sunday, some 5,669, or 96.1 percent of the voters, 
voted against the plan to construct the nuclear plant in 
Kungliao, while 176 voters supported the plan. 
  Taipower officials said that it attached great importance to 
the vote, and will study the reason for villagers' opposition 
before embarking on another round of communications with them. 
  They noted however that only 58 percent of the eligible 
voters turned out to vote. 
  Taipower also announced that it will subsidize electricity 
fees for Kungliao villagers as soon as the budget for the fourth 
nuclear power plant is approved by the legislature. 
  Taipower President Chang Shih-min will lead Taipower 
officials to visit Kungliao leaders Tuesday to solicit their 
support for the plan. 
  Chang said that the vote is not legally binding and that the 
plant should be constructed for the welfare of the nation. 
Plans to construct the plant should not be swayed by the vote 
alone, he said. 
  Chang reiterated that the fourth nuclear plant will boast 
the 
world's best security and environmental facilities. 
  Chao Kuo-tung, chief of Kungliao Village, said he was 
thrilled that most of the voters were against the plan, but said 
that the 11,000 residents in Kungliao do not have enough 
strength. 
  Chao asked Taipei County Magistrate You Ching to hold a 
public poll in Taipei County to solidify the opposition force. 
You said he supports the idea of a poll but will have to spend 
time studying the issues first. 
  Anti-nuclear activists said they are not content with this 
"triumph" and have planned other actions to prevent construction 
of the plant' Legislator Chou Po-lun said that if the ruling 
Kuomintang tries to force the budget for the nuclear plant 
through the legislature next month, he will mobilize Kungliao 
villagers to form a self-defense force to block the construction 
of the plant. 
  He said that anti-nuclear groups will begin a series of 
protests this [words indistinct] the Legislative Yuan Tuesday 
and National Assembly and the Presidential Office Thursday and 
stage a large demonstration against the nuclear plant next 
Sunday.

  [Text] Wearied by mounting anti-nuclear sentiment, the lack 
of a clear government policy and prohibitive investment costs, 
state energy planners are dropping their controversial plan to 
build Thailand's first nuclear power plant. 
  The move is apparent in the new power plant development 
project master plan being revised by the Electricity Generating 
Authority of Thailand (EGAT), from which the nuclear option has 
been deleted along with other problematic schemes. 
  According to Nopphadon Salitdisuk assistant chief of EGAT's 
generation system development planning division, the authority 
does not wish to proceed with the plan, which saw the first two 
of six 1,000-megawatt nuclear power units being commissioned in 
2006. 
  Mr Nopphadon said yesterday that EGAT will not seek to 
undertake the nuclear project at least in the period 1994-2011, 
making the possibility of such a project being implemented look 
remote. 
  Other "less socially sensitive" and conventional thermal 
power houses, using for instance imported natural gas and coal, 
will substitute for the suspended nuclear plant scheme, he said. 
  He cited the lack of public acceptance of nuclear power 
plants as the prime factor behind EGAT's decision to withdraw 
the plan. 
  But he said that the project may not be abandoned entirely, 
and EGAT will continue to study various aspects so that "when 
the time of public acceptance comes" the project can be 
relaunched. 
  Prathin Phatthanaphon, deputy governor of the Petroleum 
Authority of Thailand (PTT), yesterday confirmed EGAT's move. 
  He said that among other things, the question of safety is 
uppermost in the minds of the public, and the extremely high 
investment cost of the nuclear facilities make the project 
itself financially unviable. 
  The cost of building a nuclear power plant is some 
U.S.$2,000 
per kilowatt compared to $1,200 for one using imported coal and 
$650 for a combined cycle plant fuelled by natural gas. 
  Dr Phiyasawat Amranan, deputy secretary general of the 
National Energy Policy Office, said the Government does not need 
to come to a decision today on whether to proceed with the 
nuclear project because there is still insufficient information 
with which to make a decision. 
  "We have 12 years before the planned nuclear power plant is 
envisaged. We still have a few more years (to decide)," he said. 
  But Dr Phiyasawat, a key state energy planner, suggested to 
Business Post that nuclear energy is destined to have a lower 
priority in the overal] near-term energy plan. 
  There are energy alternatives which can be made available to 
meet the country's fast-growing electricity demand more easily 
than nuclear, he said. 
  "Why don't we first look into imported coal and LNG 
(liquefied natural gas)? More natural gas from the Gulf of 
Thailand will become available for power plant fuels," he said. 
"Furthermore, there is the potential for increasing power supply 
to Thailand from hydro- electric projects in Laos, and there is 
potential for tapping huge hydro-electric resources in Burma," 
he added. 
  State energy planners' latest stance on nuclear energy comes 
less than three months after Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said 
Thailand may have to take the nuclear option in order to arrest 
the country's fastgrowing electricity demand. 
  In his first public remarks on whether Thailand should build 
nuclear power plants, the Premier said the Government can 
neither overlook nor reject nuclear as a possible source of 
power generation. 
  Alternative energy sources for Thailand have their 
limitations, Mr Chuan said, while acknowledging public concern 
about the safety risks and the high cost of nuclear power. 
  Mr Chuan said public sentiment on the issue will be the most 
important factor deciding whether nuclear plants should be built 
here. 
  The World Bank has suggested that Thailand drop its nuclear 
power plant project, which it sees as more expensive than other 
options. 
  It advises Thailand to turn to natural gas, particularly 
imported LNG, and insists that nuclear power be considered only 
as a last option.

  [Text] A news conference held in Usti nad Orlici today was 
dedicated to the alleged production of virological and 
bacteriological weapons in Techonin, East Bohemian region. Our 
correspondent Zdena Cela filed this telephone dispatch: 
  Cela: The military Immunology and Bacteriology 
Research Institute in Techonin in Usti nad Orlici district has 
never produced, developed, or stored military bacteriological 
weapons. This is what Dr. Jiri Beran, dean of the Hradec 
Kralove-based Military Medical Academy who is in charge of 
scientific work, told the news conference today. Development of 
a combat biological agent is above all a matter for top 
scientists in the sphere of gene handling and genetic 
engineering, Beran went on to say. The point is that all the 
agents have been identified [zmapovat] and if one wants to 
develop a new agent, a new part of a genetic information 
[carrier] would have to be inserted [in the already identified 
agents]. No work has ever been done on this subject at the 
Military Medical Academy. 
  Dr. Beran explained the attacks waged by CESKY DENIK in 
March 
this year by saying that editors have little knowledge of the 
subject and are unwilling to look deeper into the problem. 
  The matter is being investigated by the Defense Ministry 
inspection team and by an interministerial commission.

  [Text] Doboj, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim forces were 
attacking Serb positions in the Teslic area, northern Bosnia, on 
Monday and Tuesday night, using all weapons available, including 
missiles charged with poison gases. 
  The brunt of the Muslim attack was launched on the southern 
part of the Teslic battlefront and on the Kozilo area, which 
came under a cannonade of artillery shells charged with poison 
gas, Bosnian Serb army sources said on Wednesday. 
  The Serbs were forced to respond fiercefully [as received] 
and neutralize the Muslim shelling in order to protect their 
positions and the people of Teslic and the adjacent villages. 
  Serb forces have prevented two Muslim terrorist actions in 
the south-eastern Teslic front. 
  The Serb army sources said that Muslim forces at about 5 
a.m. 
(local time) on Wednesday opened heavy anti-aircraft gunfire on 
Serb defence positions in Lukici, eight kilometres west of the 
Serb town of Brcko, in northern Bosnia. 
  From the northern Bosnian Croat enclave of Orasje, Bosnian 
Croat forces and Croatia's regular troops on Tuesday night 
opened strong infantry fire on Serb positions seven kilometres 
away from the area, leaving one Serb soldier lightly wounded.

  [Text] Although the National Commission for Atomic Energy 
(CNEA) admitted only yesterday that negotiations had been under 
way, the Canadian atomic energy company has affirmed that 
Argentina signed a "memorandum of understanding" for the 
installation of another nuclear reactor in the country. 
  Argentina's plans to acquire a new nuclear plant are 
expressed in a document signed with Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. 
(AECL), which will be in charge of conducting a feasibility 
study for installing a Candu-3 reactor, similar to the one 
installed at the Embalse nuclear plant in Cordoba. The new 
nuclear plant would cost about $600 million. 
  There are at least two curious things about this report. One 
is that AECL Chairman Bruce Howe himself admitted before the 
Canadian Congress that the economic viability of the kind of 
reactor Argentina is interested in buying is "doubtful". 
  The second is that in response to CLARIN, the CNEA press 
office admitted only yesterday that "negotiations have been 
under way, although nothing has been signed." This contradicts 
a report on the signing of the agreement, which published in the 
17 March issue of NUCLEONICS WEEK, the most prestigious 
publication on international nuclear industry matters. 
  Even more curious is the title of this article: "Despite the 
Unclear Economics of Candu-3, Argentina Will Try." The article 
states that "despite AECL's doubts about the economic viability 
of Candu-3, the company is trying to sell it abroad (...). It 
also announces the signing of a memorandum of understanding with 
CNEA to conduct a feasibility study to interconnect a 450 
megawatt reactor to the Argentine energy generator system. 
  According to biologist Raul Montenegro, chairman of the 
Foundation for the Defense of the Environment [Fundacion para la 
Defensa del Ambiente) (FUNAM), the idea of installing in 
Argentina a reactor that "the Canadians themselves believe is 
uneconomical shows that Argentina continues to be the test tube 
for developed countries." 
  Although CNEA has officially denied the signing of this 
agreement, an important CNEA researcher has confirmed the report 
to CLARIN. He asserted that "no reactor of this kind is yet 
operating in the entire world." This means that if this reactor 
is installed in Argentina, it will be the first ever, that same 
as happened with Atucha-1, which -- according to experts -- 
resulted in so many problems precisely because it was a 
prototype whose manufacture was later discontinued, and which 
had not been previously tested. 
  The report not only contradicts the international trend to 
reduce the use of nuclear energy in the production of 
electricity. It also seems to contradict the theory upheld by 
some government areas: In the last issue of ECONOMIC NEWS 
magazine -- issued by the Mediterranean Foundation, connected, 
naturally, to Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo -- Economist Juan 
Novara states that "contrary to what is publicized, nuclear 
energy is not clean, cheap, or price competitive." 
  The "fourth nuclear plant," is, however, not as 
contradictory 
within the framework of the program to privatize all nuclear 
plants. This idea is promoted by Cavallo himself, on the basis 
of the deficit in this area: Because about $900 million per 
year are invested in nuclear energy, and only $300 million 
obtained from energy sales, this deficit could be decreased by 
allowing private business to be in charge of selling electricity 
and the government in charge of its control. A country that 
offers four nuclear plants, instead of the two that are 
currently operating, would be more attractive. 
  Perhaps all these doubts (economic efficiency, 
privatization, 
which is still resisted within the CNEA, and naturally, the 
risks that nuclear energy entails) may have caused an apparently 
simple commercial transaction to become a state secret. 
  The memorandum signed between Argentina and Canada does not 
specify the work to be done, or where the future nuclear plant 
would be installed. This will be the fourth nuclear plant if 
Atucha-2 is ever completed. It can be ascertained, however, 
that this information is being studied, as according to what 
AECL reported in March, the agreement estimates that "the first 
results will be provided by mid-year." 
  Half of the year has already elapsed, and CNEA has not even 
reported the existence of this memorandum of understanding. 
  Raul Montenegro, former Cordoba Province energy under 
secretary, has informed CLARIN, however, that "logical economics 
on the output of this type of reactor state that it would be 
viable only if it were situated next to the Embalse Rio Tercero 
nuclear plant." 
  This is not an outlandish idea if we consider that the site 
next to the Embalse Rio Tercero nuclear plant was preselected 
about eight years ago, when the idea of installing a fourth 
nuclear plant was still prevalent. 
  CNEA experts consulted by CLARIN agreed with this theory. 
They said: "There are very few sites in the country where this 
reactor would be economically viable. Embalse Rio Tercero is 
one of them."

<F P=106> [Report by Claudia Moreira from Brasilia] </F>
  [Text] The federal Senate has approved the amendments to 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, which guarantees the non-use of nuclear 
weapons. This was reported by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
[Begin recording] 
  Amorim: The treaty represents our total 
integration in a system of guarantees proscribing the use of 
nuclear weapons. It is a treaty that includes all of Latin 
America and the Caribbean. All the meaningful countries ratified 
it, except for Cuba, which did not sign it. However, I believe 
that now with this ratification by Brazil, as well as by 
Argentina and Chile -- which were the countries that promoted 
the amendments -- Cuba will now sign it. 
  With this, Latin America and the Caribbean will be an area 
totally free of nuclear weapons. It must be pointed out that 
the treaty not only entails a commitment by Latin America but by 
the nuclear powers as well not to use or keep nuclear weapons in 
Latin America. [end recording] 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty also allows the control of nuclear 
installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] Brasilia, 19 May (EFE) -- Official sources announced 
here today that the governments of Brazil and Germany will 
continue the construction of the Angra-2 nuclear plant on the 
Rio de Janeiro coastline despite the protests of the Greenpeace 
environmental organization. 
  Mines and Energy Minister Alexis Stepanenko recommended to 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco that construction work -- 
which was halted several years ago -- be resumed at the Angra-2 
site. 
  Three-fourths of Angra-2's construction has been completed, 
and the German Government and banks have offered loans to 
finance the remaining one-fourth of the project. 
  Mines and Energy Ministry sources noted that it would be 
cheaper to complete the plant's construction than "to render the 
investments already made there useless." German Embassy sources 
noted that to backtrack at this point would cost as much as to 
finish the plant. 
  In light of the Brazilian commitment to make peaceful use of 
nuclear energy, reflected in a number of treaties recently 
ratified by Congress, the German Embassy has noted that the Bonn 
government is in favor of continuing the project. 
  Brazil signed an agreement on nuclear safeguards with 
Argentina. After approving some new amendments, it also has 
ratified the Tlatelolco Treaty -- which proscribes atomic 
weapons in Latin America, and has agreed to allow the inspection 
of its installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA).

  [Text] Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has said that 
the Middle Eastern countries have spent a trillion dollars on 
arms purchases. He said: We took the food out of our 
children's mouths to pay for arms and half this sum would have 
changed the Middle East. 
  It is not the Arab countries that started the arms race, but 
Israel. If we reviewed the military budgets of the Arab 
countries before the establishment of Israel, we would find that 
they were modest. We used to spend far more on health and 
education than on arms. 
  Israel purchased arms from Communist Czechoslovakia and 
Israeli committees roamed the world to buy arms. Egypt then 
moved and concluded arms contracts with communist countries. 
Thus was the feverish race triggered. 
  Israel not only began the arms race but also introduced 
political assassinations into the region with the assassination 
of British Minister of State Moyne and assassinations followed. 
  President Mubarak called for removing atomic bombs from the 
Middle Eastern countries and all these countries responded 
positively except Israel, which insisted on continuing to make 
atomic bombs. If Israel really wants peace, the first thing it 
must do is to join the Arab countries' consensus and get rid of 
its atomic bombs. 
  Israel is mistaken if it imagines that it can have a 
monopoly 
on the atomic bomb in the region. Certain regional countries 
have indeed reached the stage of making atomic bombs and, in a 
few years, most regional countries will reach this stage. These 
countries will lavish funds on catching up with Israel. 
Israel's interests lie in stopping this danger that threatens 
it and us. The Israeli foreign minister told the truth when he 
said: The world will not pay us the price of our folly.

<F P=106> [Article by "Analyzer"] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to the United 
States has become quite a controversial issue now. A feeling 
has emerged that the Clinton Administration is trying to 
blackmail us and force us into a situation that binds our hands. 
  The global situation today has made the United States a 
superpower. It is resorting to various types of tricks to make 
us sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] when in Asia, 
Pakistan and China possess nuclear weapons. 
  The United States has been keeping an eye on us after we 
successfully test-fired the five missiles -- Agni, Prithvi, 
Akash, Trishul, and Nag. At first, it supported Pakistan on the 
Kashmir issue and later calmed down after the resolution on 
Kashmir was defeated at the Geneva Human Rights Conference. 
  The United States could not prevent China from continuing to 
manufacture nuclear weapons. It has decided to provide F-16 
fighter planes to the Benazir Bhutto government. 
  With the help of these aircraft, Pakistan can easily target 
our numerous vital installations, including nuclear power 
plants, and destroy them. A long border exists between India 
and China. It is a historical fact that even when China-India 
friendship was flourishing, China invaded us in 1962 and 
committed aggression against our territory. Nevertheless, while 
Chinese strength is emerging, the United States wants us to halt 
even the tests of missiles like "Agni". 
  There is a feeling that India floundered during the recent 
talks between the representatives of India and the United States 
in London. However, the prime minister has, time and again, 
said that we will not succumb to any pressure on the NPT. 
  The events occurring after the visit of U.S. Deputy 
Secretary 
of State Talbott, however, conform to the prevailing view that 
the United States is stepping up its pressure on India. 
  Earlier, there was a report that Dr. Abdul Kalam, the great 
scientist hailing from Ramanathapuram, who is known as the 
"father of missiles" would be transferred from his post. 
Opposition leader Vajpayee raised the question whether this 
scientist, who brought laurels to the country by producing 
"Agni," was going to retire. The government immediately 
announced that that Dr. Abdul Kalam's tenure would continue. 
  The NPT is discriminatory. What is the justification for the 
countries who have already amassed a lot of lethal nuclear 
weapons, to ask a country, which has acquired only the technical 
know-how, to sign the NPT first? Our thinking so far has been 
that the NPT will not apply to India. 
  The situation changed a little since signing the GATT 
accord. 
An opinion has emerged that as stated by the United States, 
5+2+2 [the five recognized nuclear powers plus Germany and Japan 
plus India and Pakistan] countries can hold talks on the subject. 
  Our government has not made any categorical announcements on 
this in the parliament. Opposition leader Vajpayee says that 
the prime minister should assure that he will not discuss 
anything other than economic issues during his visit to the 
United States. 
  Leaders like Former Prime Minister Chandrashekhar and the 
ruling party's Professor Tiwari are apprehensive that the prime 
minister's visit can culminate in some dangerous consequences. 
  Political observers opine that Prime Minister Narasimha 
Rao's 
first meeting with President Clinton will create problems when 
Clinton's political maneuvers are totally against India. 
  Among international circles, it has clearly been felt that 
Clinton, who is very particular about providing the F-16 nuclear 
bomb carrier to Pakistan, is trying to arrest India's growth and 
crush it. 
  About 20 years ago a nuclear test was conducted at Pokhran 
in 
Rajasthan on 18 May 1974, for peaceful purposes only. That 
underground test made it clear to the world that we have the 
capability to manufacture nuclear bombs. 
  Subsequent prime ministers, however, including Indira 
Gandhi, 
did not show interest in conducting nuclear bomb tests. 
  Thereafter, India made several achievements in nuclear 
energy. Today, we are also in a position to manufacture nuclear 
weapons by taking a few steps. Chidambaram, the chief of the 
Department of Atomic Energy [name and title as published] has 
said: There is nothing that India cannot accomplish. 
  At first, the five countries -- United States, Soviet Union, 
China, the United Kingdom, and France -- have been recognized as 
nuclear powers. But, as per the accord on nuclear 
nonproliferation in 1967, it was decided that barring these five 
countries, no one should manufacture nuclear weapons. The 
accord reached in this connection is called the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty, known as the NPT. So far, 140 
countries have signed it. 
  Iraq also signed the treaty, but it manufactured nuclear 
bombs by producing plutonium. South Africa is another country 
which signed the treaty but covertly manufactured nuclear bombs. 
North Korea also did the same thing. 
  So far, several countries, including India, Pakistan, and 
Israel have not signed the treaty. The funny thing is that 
Israel has been put on the list of honorary countries possessing 
nuclear capability. 
  No one has ever tried to prevent the countries that 
legitimately manufacture nuclear weapons in the name of the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, or to eliminate the threat they 
pose. On the other hand, the United States is using this treaty 
as a tool to prevent several peaceful projects, including the 
launching of satellites. On this basis only, it put 
restrictions on Russia in supplying cryogenic engines even to 
India. Therefore, not only India, but France, Argentina, China, 
South Africa have not accepted the NPT. 
  After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia, 
Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Belarus possess nuclear weapons. 
  Hence, including Germany and Japan with the already existing 
five nuclear countries, there are seven countries manufacturing 
nuclear weapons. By adding India and Pakistan, it has been 
calculated that there are five+two+two nuclear countries. The 
United States wants all of them to end their nuclear tests. 
  As a first step, the United States wants the halting of 
tests 
for all missile programs, including "Agni". 
  If the Agni, Akash, and Trishul missiles are installed on 
our 
borders, they will help us face any attack from Pakistan or 
China. 
  Already, due to resource constraints, we are not able to 
provide the armed forces with the necessary sophisticated 
weapons. Under these circumstances, if important missiles like 
"Agni" are crippled, it will benefit certain countries such as 
Pakistan. 
  Therefore, the Rao government is constrained to convince the 
people that the country should go nuclear. Otherwise, as 
India's enemies could wage a war against it at any time, it has 
no recourse other than face a very delicate situation. Only 
after this realization, several reports about the pressure 
exerted by the United States began appearing. The Indian 
Government is also constrained to explain to the people and the 
parliament about its position every now and then.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Pressler's Proposal"] </F>
  [Text] The suggestion of Larry Pressler, U.S. Republican 
party senator and the author of the Pressler Law, that China's 
nuclear programs should be capped along with India's and 
Pakistan's seems to be an honest one. He is right in saying 
that India cannot give up its nuclear program because of China's 
continuing nuclear program. This suggestion makes it quite 
clear that Pressler's attitude is free from any prejudice. He 
goes into the details of an issue and arrives at an objective 
analysis. He had argued first before the U.S. administration 
that economic aid to Pakistan should be stopped because Pakistan 
was secretly manufacturing the nuclear bomb. He has again 
advanced the argument that F-16 fighter planes should not be 
supplied to Pakistan because there is a danger of a nuclear war 
between India and Pakistan. F-16 fighter planes could be used 
to drop nuclear bombs. Pressler has further said that Solarz is 
considered a friend of India and he is very knowledgeable as far 
as this area is concerned. The way the proposal to appoint him 
as the envoy to India has been taken back has been condemned by 
Pressler. Maybe Pressler has not been a close friend of India 
as Solarz has been, but his neutrality has certainly shown that 
he is a well wisher of India. 
  The proposal advanced by Pressler fully fits into the U.S.' 
South Asia policy; hence, the U.S. administration will 
definitely ponder over it. America wants South Asia to be a 
zone totally free of nuclear weapons. But is it possible for 
America to "arm-twist" China? We don't think that America can 
persuade China to cap its nuclear program. Like India, China 
can also ask why only South Asia should be converted into a 
nuclear weapons free zone? America has inter-continental 
missiles which can drop nuclear bombs at a given target. 
However, Larry Pressler's proposal goes in favor of India and 
India can't give up its nuclear program, not only because of 
Pakistan, but because of China also. Recently, the Chinese 
Ambassador to India said that India could not be forced to sign 
the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty] because India is a sovereign 
country. China is not as opposed to India's nuclear capacity as 
the U.S. is. Of course, the Chinese envoy's statement about 
India was in line with his country's own interests. Each country 
talks about its own interests. Therefore, India can do 
likewise, and its arguments will be carried to the U.S. 
administration by people like Pressler, which will strengthen 
the Indian stance in America. Of course, nothing may come out 
of it, but the fact remains that India's position is being 
properly understood.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 4 -- The man behind the success of 
Prithvi is 62-year-old Dr Avul Pakir Jainalaben Abdul Kalam who 
believes that India should acquire deadly missiles that will put 
the fear of God into its enemies. 
  Towards that goal he has been working relentlessly for the 
past 15 years. According to his friends, Dr Kalam's only dream 
is to make India a respected, if not feared, world power by the 
end of this century. 
  Dr Kalam, an aeronautical engineer and bachelor, has been 
the 
architect of India's integrated guided missile development 
programme and the most important achievement of the programme is 
that it is the first successful endeavour in the country to 
harness indigenous talent to design and develop state-of-the-art 
tactical and strategic missiles. 
  Of the five families of missiles that he committed himself 
to 
develop and deliver four surface-to-surface missile Prithvi, 
medium range ground-to-air Akash, short-range quick reaction SAM 
[surface-to-air missile] Trishul and the Anti-tank guided 
missile Nag are close to production stage. 
  His most ambitious project, Agni, the intermediate range 
ballistic missile, has already completed three tests. For him 
Agni is truly like a child. The bachelor Tamilian in his poem, 
"Ancestors' desire" tells about his parents, now dead, wanted 
him to marry and have the children and how he could not satisfy 
their desire. 
  But after Agni was successfully launched, Dr Kalam wrote: 
"My parents appeared in my subconscious mind 
  Smiles on their faces, tear filled eyes, blessing me with 
grace 
  For their grandson `Agni', the symbol of strength 
  And a continuity of their name." 
  In another poem "From Tipu's rockets to Agni," Dr Kalam said 
"I was walking on the historical shores (of Cauvery) in 
Srirangapatnam where two battles took place in the 18th century. 
India made the world's first war rocket. These rockets are in 
the British War Museum. Small tube with gun powder, tiny nozzle 
and warhead. The use of these rockets defeated the Britishers. 
History repeats." 
  Dr Kalam was born in the temple town of Rameshwaram six 
decades ago. Memories of doting family and a secure childhood 
explain the serenity on his face. Perhaps the only unpleasant 
event of his childhood he can remember was when he was separated 
from his brahmin friend by a new teacher who had his own ideas 
about social harmony. Dr Kalam who always sat on the front bench 
with his friend, was ordered to sit in the back row of the 
classroom. 
  "Even today, I am living with the image imprinted on my 
subconscious mind, of Ramaswamy crying in the class when I 
changed my seat to the rear row", writes Dr Kalam in his 
annotation to his book of poems "My journey". 
  Dr Kalam, the Agni man, says the benefits of defence 
research 
should also be used for humanitarian work, particularly in the 
field of medicine. He has founded a society for biomedical 
technology for this purpose. 
  After studies, Dr Kalam got his first job as an aeronautical 
engineer with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Kanpur. He 
then joined with Satellite Launch Vehicle Programme, and led the 
team that made Rohini and Menaka, those tiny rockets which 
aroused scepticism even derision. But the two rockets instilled 
pride -- and passion -- in Dr Kalam. No longer did Indian 
payloads need to ride on the French-built Centaur rockets. The 
success convinced him that with will and even without money, 
Indian science and technology could attain dizzy heights.

<F P=106> [Commentary by D.S. Raizada] </F>
  [Text] India's missile program is primarily intended for 
defense of country's freedom, especially in light of the 
countries having missiles that can carry both nuclear and 
nonnuclear warheads surrounding India. As a sovereign country, 
surely India, like any other country, has the right to defend 
its freedom and territorial integrity. India was forced to 
develop missiles when it saw that both Pakistan and China, as 
well as a number of West Asian countries, are having missiles 
and missile technology either indigenously developed or 
clandestinely or openly imported from the Western world. 
  During his recent visit to the United States, the Indian 
prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has in a very polite but 
firm way explained that those who advise others must practice a 
similar advice themselves. India had been in favor of 
elimination of all weapons of mass destruction and had been 
advocating at all international forums the need to keep the 
world free from nuclear and chemical weapons. But India cannot 
close its eyes to the latest weaponry available with its 
immediate neighbors that exposes all its cities to the target of 
the missile. 
  Of all the countries, America, [which] has been carrying 
relentless campaign against India's missile program, knows fully 
well that both Pakistan and China not only have technology, but 
also have deployed missiles around India. The talk of South 
Asia to be kept away from all missiles becomes fruitless without 
capping Chinese missile program and arsenal and without keeping 
Indian Ocean free of missiles deployed by the United States 
under one cover or the other. The U.S. ambassador designate to 
India, Mr. Frank Wisner, told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee last Tuesday [24 May] that United States hoped that 
India would consider very carefully before deploying short-range 
Prithvi missile. In a rather one go, he said the United States 
continues to argue in a reasoned manner with India about the 
consequences of missile deployment. 
  Supplying F-16's to Pakistan for carrying nuclear weapons on 
one side and dealing with China with a different tone while 
threatening India to scuttle its missile and space technology 
program does not speak the language of a friend. Whether 
America likes Prithvi or not, India need not bother. What India 
has to see is its own security perceptions. No arrangement for 
preventing the danger of nuclear weapons in South Asia without 
including China would even work as India's concern about Chinese 
nuclear weapons is not without justification, which Mr. Wisner 
has himself admitted. 
  The double standards of Clinton administration with regard 
to 
the deployment of ballistic missiles especially when China is 
busy in the modernization of its Armed Forces and Pakistan is 
deploying Hatf and M-11 missiles is not what is expected from 
the United States. One wonders why the U.S. did not object when 
Saudi Arabia deployed its short-range missiles during the Gulf 
War, nor did it get up in arms when Chinese M-11 missiles were 
sent to Pakistan. India also cannot afford to forget the threat 
wielded by America in 1971 when the U.S. had moved its Seventh 
Fleet carrying nuclear weapons in the Bay of Bengal. 
  Before leaving for the U.S. early this month, the prime 
minister assured the nation that neither the usual trials nor 
deployment of Prithvi missile would be derailed whatever U.S. 
may desire. The statement of the U.S. ambassador designate to 
India at the congressional confirmation hearing, [which] is 
virtually a sort of warning to India of the likely consequences 
should the Prithvi be deployed, appears not to have impressed 
policy makers in India. Because whatever may be the U.S. stand, 
India has its own security perceptions and would naturally be 
guided by its own stand rather than by that of the U.S. India 
situated in a missile-proliferated environment and its defense 
forces, both Army and Air Force, has been looking forward to 
match the arsenals of the neighbors so that it can defend itself 
in case of any exigency. Indeed, the Indian [word indistinct] 
statement just prior to prime minister's U.S. visit left nothing 
for imagination. For, the billions of dollars flowed from U.S. 
to India or not, India must have its prestige intact and not 
allow any country to interfere in its internal affairs. Prithvi 
must be tested and the work of Agni resumed. P.V. [Narasimha 
Rao] assured its people that India is sovereign in taking 
decisions and India will not compromise with its self-esteem and 
security concerns.

  [Text] The user trials of surface-to-surface medium range 
missile Prithvi [Earth] got underway today with the successful 
launching of the missile. According to Defense Ministry 
sources, the test launch fully met the requirements. Army 
authorities are conducting the trials in actual user 
configuration at the Chandipur interim test range near Balasore 
in Orissa. According to agencies, the first launch has been 
targeted to hit the Wheeler Islands located in the Bay of 
Bengal. The next phase of trial of the 150 to 250 kilometer 
range missile will be test-fired in actual battlefield 
conditions. The missile will be targeted against built-up 
targets to test its accuracy and the impact of conventional 
weapons. The trials are to last for over two months before the 
missile is declared fit for induction into the army. 
  The trials were postponed last month as the prime minister 
was visiting the United States. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0733 GMT on 4 Jun 94 in a 
similar report adds the following: "PTI said the Prithvi (Earth) 
missile was fired in clear weather from a mobile launcher at the 
Chandipur-on-Sea test range in the eastern coastal state of 
Orissa. 
  "The missile streaked diagonally into the sky at 11:40am 
(0610 GMT), targeted to hit Wheeler's Island in the Bay of 
Bengal about 75 kilometres (45 miles) from the test range, PTI 
said."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Journalist Venkatnarain] </F>
  [Text] India appears all set to induct and deploy the short 
range surface-to-surface missile, Prithvi, with the Army 
successfully conducting the second user trial of this 
indigenously developed world class weapon system yesterday. 
Prithvi was already tested a dozen times by the Defense 
Research and Development Organization over a five-year period 
between 1988 and 1993. Last Saturday, the Army began the 
crucial preinduction trial phase with its first user trial. 
Yesterday's launch was to the missile's maximum range of 250 
kms and all the mission requirements were achieved. The entire 
exercise of the user trials is likely to be completed by the end 
of next month. Prithvi will then be cleared for induction into 
the defense forces. There may be at least six more user trials 
in battlefield conditions. 
  The Army has opted for Prithvi with a shorter ranger of 150 
kms. These missiles have the capability of carrying the more 
lethal one ton warhead payload. However, the Indian Air Force 
is opting for the 250 km range version to safeguard its forward 
air bases as well as to bring enemy forward bases within 
Prithvi's range. This will carry half a ton warhead. 
  When Prithvi's first experimental launch was successful in 
1988, Western security analysts could hardly believe that India 
could develop the missile system entirely on its own. When 
Prithvi's induction and deployment seemed imminent in 1992, the 
United States imposed trade sanctions on India. They are still 
in force, but have not prevented our scientists from developing 
this liquid propelled new generation ballistic missile. 
Prithvi's liquid engine enables its flight to be controlled 
through real time commands on board computer. [sentence as 
heard] Its altitude and range thus become greatly flexible and 
it has six alternate preprogrammed trajectories. All these make 
it far superior to the Patriot and Scud missiles which performed 
dismally during the Gulf war. Prithvi's designers and main users 
see it as an accurate weapons system that can deliver very 
specific military objectives ranging from a tactical 
battlefield, heavy artillery support system to long range 
knocking off of enemy supplies by striking at bridges, roads, 
air fields, railroads, marshalling yards, and so on. 
  Prithvi's induction and deployment into the defense forces 
will certainly enhance India's overall security by acting as a 
deterrent. Once its sister missiles like the Trishul, the Akash, 
the Nag, and the Agni make their way into the defense forces, 
any enemy will have to think more than twice before launching a 
conventional military adventure against India.

  [Text] NEW DELHI, May 25 (AFP) -- Indian authorities have 
halted the construction of two nuclear power projects after a 
suspected design flaw caused the collapse of a reactor dome at 
the Kaiga plant in the southern state of Karnataka. 
  A. Gopalakrishnan, chief of the Atomic Energy Regulatory 
Board, said in a statement Tuesday that work on the four nuclear 
reactors being built in Kaiga and Rawatbhata in the northern 
desert state of Rajasthan had been stopped. 
  He said the move was related to the May 13 collapse of the 
concrete reactor dome in Kaiga which left 14 workers injured. 
Nearly 40 percent of the 130-tonne dome fell down. 
  A probe has been ordered into the incident, blamed on 
possible design and construction flaws. All four nuclear 
reactors on which work has stopped have the same design. 
  The dome's function is to prevent the escape of radiation in 
case of an accident. 
  Gopalakrishnan clarified that the Kaiga project was still 
under construction and no nuclear fuel or heavy water had been 
transferred to the plant. 
  "Hence there is no question of any radioactivity release or 
radiological impact due to the incident," he said. 
  But the temporary halt to construction would help 
authorities 
review the dome design and construction methods to correct any 
flaws, Gopalakrishnan said, adding similar dome failures had 
taken place in the United States. 
  Findings of the probe ordered into the incident will be made 
available in two months. 
  India's seven existing nuclear power plants were closed for 
inspection in July 1993 after a fire broke out at the Narora 
station in northern India.

  [Text] Doubts have been raised over the civil construction 
technology of nuclear reactors following the mishap in the 
Reactor Building (RB) 1 at the Kaiga nuclear power project 
recently. Considering that the National Power Corporation (NPC) 
has not experienced such problems, critics feel that the setback 
calls for a review. 
  The Project Director, Mr. Paramahams Tiwari, said an enquiry 
into the design and execution was underway. The Enquiry 
Committee includes Mr. C. M. Surendra. NPC Director 
(Engineering), Dr. Prem Krishna, Professsor, (Civil Engineering, 
Roorkee Universlty, Mr. D. Rajappa, Chairman and Managing 
Director, Ministry of Water Resources, and Mr. Kushawaha, Head, 
Reactor Structure Section. 
  Following the mishap on May 13, when about 130 tonnes of 
concrete from the under-surface of the inner dome fell from 40 
feet, some debris had to be cleared to prevent it from damaging 
the dust-sensitive equipment housed in RB 1. To document 
evidence for further enquiry, videographs and photographs were 
taken. he added. 
  While the civil construction work was curtailed, othcr 
electrical and mechanical jobs were being done in the building. 
  The total dome would now have to be recast, which could be 
done in three months. It would not delay the project scheduled 
for completion in June 1996, Mr. Tiwari explained. 
  The structure design, submitted by Stup Consultants, Bombay, 
was approved by the NPC and cleared by AERB. Subsequently, 
I&amp;T 
was awarded the civil construction contract which includes the 
RB 1. The 42-metre inner dome was designed to withstand a 
pressure of 25 pounds per square inch. 
  Designing a dome like the RB 1, which has to bear the weight 
of 600 cubic metres of concrete, involves pre-stressing. 
However, the degree to which pre-stressing can be done is 
circumscribed by parameters governing the elasticity of the 
material in use. It is pointed out that in this case, the 
localised failure might have occurred because of transcending 
the elastic limit. The structural engineers have speculated 
that the binding factor which causes the dome to hold like an 
integral whole may have also been contributory. 
  Interestingly, had not the print media chanced upon the 
event, the localised structural setback might not have become 
public. The roof of the fire-station on the project site also 
suffered minor deformations from suspected structural problems.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Experts in Iranian Nuclear </F>
Program Abducted"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Gunmen have 
abducted a Chinese engineer and two of his Iranian companions in 
southeast Iran. 
  A statement issued by the Interior Ministry in Tehran 
yesterday pointed out that the Chinese citizen, whose identity 
is not known yet, was working on the uranium mining project in 
Rudan. The policy of developing uranium resources is considered 
part of Iran's nuclear program, that is with technological 
support from China and North Korea. It is believed that the 
three abducted people handle very sensitive information 
concerning Iran's nuclear program. It is not clear whether the 
abduction operation is political in nature or was carried out by 
a gang of robbers active in that area. 
  The abduction of foreign nationals has over the past few 
months become a big problem for the government in many parts of 
Iran. In January, a 22-year-old Australian tourist disappeared 
while on his way to Shiraz, capital of the south. There has 
been no news of him since. In February and March, three North 
Korean technicians said to have been working on military 
projects near the Gulf were abducted. They still have not been 
released. 
  Last month, the body of a North Korean man was found near 
Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan. It was said that someone lured him 
and then killed him for unknown reasons. 
  The government has advised foreign nationals not to leave 
major cities individually. Excursions organized for European 
tourists have been canceled or their routes altered to avoid the 
danger of being attacked by armed gunmen on the road. 
  The Iranian Interior Ministry's report shows a big increase 
in all types of crimes, from small-scale riots through to 
organized and large-scale armed robbery and murder. This 
coincided with the smuggling of thousands of arms from Pakistan 
and Afghanistan to all areas in east and south Iran. Sometimes 
convoys of smuggled goods and drugs travel for hundreds of miles 
inside Iranian areas, protected by armed groups supported by 
personnel carries and tanks. 
  The number of foreign nationals working in Iran is estimated 
at about 18,000, compared with 1.2 million before the mullahs' 
revolution in 1979. But there are also 2.2 million Afghan 
refugees, 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds and Shiites, 
and at least 1.2 million illegal immigrants from Pakistan, 
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan.

  [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran will not take part in 
the Western-inspired arms race in the Persian Gulf. The 
commander of the Islamic Republic of Iran's Navy [Rear-Admiral 
Ali Shamkhani], who is currently in Bandar Abbas, announced the 
above today and added that Western news agencies' propaganda 
that Iran is competing with other countries in the region in the 
purchase of arms and military equipment is false. He said: The 
arms race Westerners have started in our region is more 
profitable to them than arms races in other parts of the world. 
In fact, this is plundering the wealth of the Muslim people of 
the region. 
  The navy commander also said: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
has to gain enough strength to protect 2,000 km of its marine 
border, but it believes it can strengthen its defensive 
capabilities by relying on its internal strengths and 
capabilities.

Ekeus said Sunday he had made headway in talks here with Iraqi 
officials on applying UN resolutions to destroy Iraq's weapons 
of mass destruction. 
  "We have made certain progress. But we have to preserve it 
to maintain the momentum," Ekeus told AFP after meeting Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf late Saturday, who was 
on a stopover en route for Cairo. 
  The head of the UN Special Commission for Iraqi disarmament 
(UNSCOM) is to present a report to the UN Security Council on 
Tuesday on setting up a long-term monitoring of Iraqi military 
capability due to start in July, a reliable source said. 
  Ekeus was due to resume talks late Sunday with an Iraqi 
delegation including General 'Amir Rashid head of the Iraqi 
military industries. 
  He expressed his "satisfaction" over the initial talks with 
Iraqi officials, saying they aimed at "clarifying certain issues 
in order to make progress." 
  "We are fairly satisfied, although we have not concluded our 
talks yet," he said noting that any eventual lifting of the 
Iraqi sanctions would be decided by the Security Council. 
  A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait in 
August 1990, before Iraqi President Saddam Husayn's army was 
driven out again by a U.S.-led coalition in February 1991. 
  But the embargo has remained in force backed by UN 
resolutions requiring Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass 
destruction and set up a long-term monitoring system. 
  Ekeus said the aim was to get the embargo lifted, adding 
that 
"we are trying to establish whether (Iraq) has respected the UN 
resolutions." 
  Iraq has argued on several occasions that it has complied 
fully with the resolutions. 
  He is in Amman for a meeting of the UN Economic and Social 
Commission for Western Asia, which opened Sunday.

    [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English 
at 1830 GMT on 19 May in its "3-D" program carries at 15-minute 
report entitled "Saddam's Secret Bomb," showing exclusive video 
footage of Iraq's bomb factories -- revealing the whole truth 
about Iraq's nuclear program, raising questions about the role 
of the British Government, and international monitoring agencies. 
  The program opens with shots of a Scud missile landing on an 
allied base during the Gulf war and a parade of Iraqi weaponry, 
followed by comments from David Kay, the UN investigator who 
uncovered Iraq'secret weapons program after the Gulf war. Kay 
says: "They were probably 36-months away from having deliverable 
type of weapons that would have fit either their own Scud 
missiles or extended range Scuds, or in their high performance 
aircraft in small numbers. If the war had not intervened -- as 
we sit here today in mid-1994, they would have at least have had 
crude nuclear devices, and probably their first deliverable 
packages would have coming on line." 
  Over extensive shots of Iraqi nuclear sites scattered 
throughout Iraq, and shots of various items of equipment Kay 
then says: "The major building where they were going to 
manufacture nuclear weapons, actually cast the uranium metal, 
cut it into shapes, put the high explosive around it, is one 
that could well have produced twenty nuclear weapons a year no 
problem. It was quite frankly better than most of the American 
facilities that do the same thing. A lot of the equipment was 
still there in crates, and it was really something that any lab 
in the West would be happy to have." 
  The report then shows exclusive video taken by the Iraqi's 
prior to the Gulf war, showing extensive shots of its 
(?Calutron) plant which used huge magnetic coils to extract the 
nuclear material, followed by comments from U.S Senate 
investigator Ken Timmerman who says: "We were on the verge of a 
nuclear catastrophe in Iraq and nobody was really aware of what 
was going on. One of the problems with nuclear proliferation is 
that you can never know with certainty exactly how far away a 
country such as Iraq is from the bomb. Our intelligence 
community does not know and they cannot know. The Iraqi's had a 
fantastic international procurement network. They were buying 
companies all over the world, but the very heart of it was in 
London, they would set up dummy companies to purchase on the 
open market high technology, machine-tools, nuclear materials, 
everything that they needed for their nuclear weapons program." 
  The report goes on to show footage of Iraqi factories at al- 
Tuwaitha, al-Atheer, and Badr, a list of British companies who 
unwittingly supplied equipment to Iraq, unaware it would be 
diverted to its secret bomb program, and a MI6 document warning 
of Iraq's nuclear capability. John Gordon, former head of the 
British Foreign Office Nuclear Department, then says: "I think 
Britain broke her obligations as a nuclear weapons state under 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, because under Article One we are 
enjoined and we agree in no way directly or indirectly to help 
other countries acquire nuclear weapons, and in selling 
machine-tool equipment which we knew might well be used for 
making centrifuges for the illicit nuclear weapon enrichment 
program, it seemed to me we were quite clearly in breach of this 
obligation." 
  Over footage of UN inspections of the Iraqi bomb sites, 
Kimmerman concludes by saying: "A nuclear India, a nuclear 
Pakistan, a potentially nuclear Iran, potentially nuclear Iraq, 
a nuclear North Korea, perhaps South Korea, perhaps Japan as 
well armed with nuclear weapons. What is going to keep them 
from using those weapons? There are no security arrangements 
that could prevent the next war from being nuclear. There are 
other countries that are seeking nuclear weapons and they are 
doing the same things that the Iraqi's did, the same type of 
procurement, and we in our greed are making the same mistakes."

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpt] The United States is urging Israel to ratify the 
international convention on the elimination of chemical weapons 
within a few months. Israel will respond to this U.S. request, 
which was recently received here, by the end of the month. The 
Defense and Foreign Ministries are preparing to hold 
consultations on the reply. 
  On 22 May, a discussion on the Chemical Weapons Convention 
[CWC] was held at Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' office. 
Israel signed the convention in January 1993. In its reply to 
the United States, it will presumably announce that since the 
ratification date is not until next year, Israel will not 
address the issue at the present time. To prevent the CWC from 
harming its security and to ensure a Middle East free of 
chemical weapons, however, Israel will demand that Arab 
countries also sign the convention. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has declared 
that Pakistan will not give up its peaceful nuclear program 
under any circumstances. She was talking to a group of newsmen 
in Islamabad this evening. She made it clear that they were 
pursuing a well-thoughtout policy in this connection and 
Pakistan could ill afford to dispense with its knowledge in this 
vital field. She pointed that Pakistan has been subjected to 
three wars in the past and it was dismembered also. She 
recalled that Pakistan had never violated the Nonproliferation 
Treaty and it was India which violated it by exploding a nuclear 
device.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
said on Thursday that Islamabad had given counter proposals in 
response to U.S. suggestion that Pakistan should allow 
non-intrusive inspection of its nuclear installations. 
  "The question of non-intrusive inspection is an American 
proposal and we have given counter-proposals based on a regional 
solution," Ms Bhutto said at a news conference on her return 
from Nepal. 
  She was asked to comment on a recent statement of Foreign 
Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali in which he had said that 
Pakistan was ready to allow non-intrusive inspection of its 
nuclear installations. 
  Denying that the foreign ministor had made any such offer, 
she said: "Pakistan will not accept any unilateral solution or 
proposal." 
  Questioned whether President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari would 
be discussing the nuclear issue with American officials during 
his current visit to the United States, the Prime Minister said 
though the President's visit was a private one, "we are using 
this occasion to have informal talks with U.S. officials and to 
explain Pakistan's position on the nuclear issue." 
  Ms Bhutto said she would also be visiting the United States 
by the end of this year. "I hope it will be a substantive 
visit." 
  The Prime Minister said the Pressler Amendment, which debars 
Pakistan from getting U.S. military and economic aid, was a 
discriminatory law, "and we want it should go." [sentence as 
received] 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan shared US concern over nuclear 
proliteration, "but we feel the Pressler Amendment is a veto in 
the hand of India." 
  She said Pakistan and the United States were cooperating in 
anti-narcotics campaign and defence of human rights, and added 
that the two could move in the nuclear non-proliferation field 
provided a regional approach on this issue was agreed upon. 
  Pakistan, she said, was anxious to improve its relations 
with 
the United States, but hastened to add that it did not want to 
do so just for having F-16 fighter aircraft. 
  "We don't want one-dimensional relationship. It should be a 
multi-dimensional one," she asserted. 
  Ms Bhutto said Pakistan had supported America during Soviet 
invasion of Afghanistan. "We have defended freedom in 
Afghanistan and we are cooperating with the United Nations in 
its peacekeeping preparations in Somalia and other parts of the 
world," she said, while calling for closer relationship between 
the two countries. 
  She said her government was building Pakistan as a modern 
Islamic state where rule of law would be supreme. She said a 
society would be built where women would have an equal role to 
play. A women's police station had already been set up and 
women's courts would also be established, she said. 
  Answering a question, Ms Bhutto said she wanted the 
opposition to cooperate with the government on three main issues 
-- Pakistan-U.S. relations, Pakistan-India ties and the nuclear 
issue. "On these three subjects we (the government and the 
opposition) should have a unified stand," she said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said that 
Pakistan is ready to consider any proposal, which is aimed at 
verifying without interference, that its nuclear program is not 
weapons-oriented. Talking to newsmen at the Foreign Office in 
Islamabad yesterday, he said that Pakistan has repeatedly made 
it clear that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and 
the United States has accepted the Pakistani position. He said 
that Pakistan will not relinquish its principled stand on the 
nuclear issue, but is ready to consider any proposal aimed at 
nonintrusive verification. 
  The foreign minister said that although Pakistan does have 
the capability to manufacture a nuclear weapon, a political 
decision has been taken that it will not be manufactured. He 
said the decision has nothing to do with the United States or 
anyone else. 
  Answering a question, the foreign minister said that 
Pakistan 
is not engaged in any secret diplomacy with the United States 
and it will not compromise on the nuclear issue. He regretted 
that India rejected every aspect of the U.S. proposal on making 
South Asia a nuclear-free zone.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 18 -- As President Farooq Ahmed 
Leghari embarked on a two-week "unofficial", but "working" visit 
to the United States, official circles here on Wednesday 
expressed cautious optimism on improvement of bilateral 
relations between Washington and Islamabad. 
  "The delivery of F-16s to Pakistan and the issue of 
non-intrusive inspection of our nuclear facilities by the United 
States, will possibly come under review during President Farooq 
Leghari's deliberations with the Clinton Administration," 
Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told newsmen. 
  In the light of India's refusal to the U.S. proposals on its 
nuclear non-proliferation Sardar Asif was asked to clarify 
Pakistan's position on its acceptance of nuclear "non-intrusive" 
inspection. He said: "If the U.S. proposals are acceptable to 
Pakistan and are totally in line with our nuclear policy, we 
will accept them." 
  Would Pakistan then he accepting them unilaterally, given 
the 
fact that India had already rejected all such American 
proposals? The Foreign Minister was unable to give a 
satisfactory reply. 
  Conceding that the "United States through its non-intrusive 
technical means was satisfied that Pakistan had not as yet 
produced nuclear weapons," the Foreign Minister listed recent 
positive developments which indicated a renewed U.S. 
understanding of Pakistan's stated position on its nuclear 
programme, which was now more "even-handed." 
  "The fact that the United States has not asked us to roll 
back our nuclear programme, but to cap it instead, and its 
viewing of the non-proliferation issue in the context of 
regional security," puts Pakistan on a "high moral ground", as 
opposed to India, who has bluntly refused the U.S. proposals on 
capping and verifiable physical or nonphysical inspection of its 
nuclear sites, he said. 
  The Foreign Minister was confident that Pakistan would not 
only get the 38 F-16s but also succeed in resolving the nuclear 
issue with the United States by the end of this year. "But, our 
view on receipt of F-16s and capping of our nuclear programme is 
very clear: the two have nothing to do with each other," Sardar 
Asif pointed out. 
  On the downside of U.S.-Pakistan relations, Sardar Asif, 
reacting sharply to the American State Department spokesman, 
Mike McCurry's statement on alleged official Pakistani support 
to the Kashmiri Mujahideen and that Pakistan could be put on the 
terrorist list any time, said: "We are extremely surprised that 
a senior official should make such an allegation against 
Pakistan. It leads us to believe that these kinds of statements 
are made perhaps to please Mr Narasimha Rao." 
  Sardar Asif said the Western world was bending backwards to 
please the Indian Prime Minister. "Selling cokes appears more 
important than solving the human rights problems," he remarked 
in reply to a question about the West disregarding India's human 
rights violations in lieu of economic trade-offs. 
  Sardar Asif, who leaves for Afghanistan on May 24 carrying 
peace proposals for the Afghan leaders, told newsmen that apart 
from re-opening the Pakistan mission in Kabul in the building 
the British government has partly handed over, he will discuss 
the possibility of opening another mission in Herat with General 
Ismail Khan. 
  The foreign minister will float the idea for an Afghanistan 
peace making fund, because when normality is restored, 
Afghanistan will need a lot of money for reconstruction.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Linking Kashmir and the Nuclear Issue"] </F>
  [Text] President Farooq Leghari, currently on a visit to 
the United States, has in an interview with Cable News Network 
(CNN) urged the U.S. to play a key role in resolving the Kashmir 
issue. He has, at the same time, sought to establish a linkage 
between Kashmir and the nuclear issue, which remains high on the 
U.S. agenda. However, the problem is that current U.S. policy 
favours dealing with the two issues separately. This was fairly 
evident from the observations of the U.S. deputy secretary of 
state after his recent visit to the subcontinent. Kashmir, as 
far as the U.S. is concerned, is to be dealt with by India and 
Pakistan, bilaterally, under the terms of the Simla Agreement. 
This, of course, suits India which has successfully managed to 
avoid meaningful bilateral negotiations with Pakistan on the 
Kashmir issue for over two decades. At the same time, India has 
consistently turned down proposals for involving any third party 
in the matter and asserted, at times with a touch of the 
indignant, that the two neighbours were perfectly capable of 
resolving their own problems. However, it is clear that Pakistan 
now sees a third party role as unavoidable if India is to be 
pushed into addressing the Kashmir issue seriously and put an 
end to its efforts to resolve it through sheer brute force. 
Such a role would be far from unprecedented in the context of 
settling matters between the two countries. As President 
Leghari pointed out at another forum, the Indus Basin Treaty and 
the Runn of Kutch award were agreements reached on difficult 
issues only after third party intercession. 
  As for the nuclear issue, not only is the U.S. unwilling to 
link it with Kashmir, it also seems to be giving way to India's 
contention that the nuclear programmes of India and Pakistan 
cannot be treated on a par and should be dealt with separately 
by the United States. In effect, this means that the U.S. should 
continue to pressurise Pakistan through various means, such as 
the Pressler Amendment, while India continues developing its 
nuclear potential as well as missile technology. It may well be 
in this context that President Leghari has struck a tough note 
on the issue of inspection, of any kind, of nuclear sites. 
While a recent statement of the foreign minister made it seem 
as if Pakistan was willing to consider on merits a U.S. proposal 
for non-intrusive inspection, the president has now pointedly 
emphasised the aspect of linkage by asserting that Pakistan will 
accept inspection or verification regimes only in the context of 
a regional solution involving India. The U.S. may have logical 
grounds for believing that certain major issues pertaining to 
the subcontinent are more amenable to a solution, when dealt 
with separately, but if such a mode is seen to work to the 
advantage of only one party the other is bound to see linkage, 
at least in some areas, as unavoidable.

  [Text] A Foreign Office spokesman said that there has been 
no change in Pakistan's principled policy on the nuclear issue. 
Clarifying a statement by Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad 
Ali, the spokesman said that the press has attributed an 
incorrect statement to him. The foreign minister said that the 
United States proposed that if Pakistan agreed on a verifiable 
restriction [bandish] on its nuclear program, then there will be 
a one time exemption from the Pressler Amendment. 
  The foreign minister categorically reaffirmed the Pakistani 
stand that Pakistan was ready to consider all proposals on 
declaring South Asia a nuclear-free zone provided these 
proposals were just and nondiscriminatory. The spokesman said 
that the nuclear issue is an extremely sensitive one and a 
national consensus on it is very essential. He expressed the 
hope that the press will keep national interests in view and 
refrain from out of context presentations of statements on this 
most important issue.

  [Text] Islamabad, May 26 -- Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
on Thursday barred her cabinet members from issuing any 
statement on the country's nuclear programme. 
  "I will direct the ministers not to speak on the nuclear 
issue or answer any question in this regard," Ms. Bhutto said 
at a Press conference. 
  She said the nuclear issue was a specialised subject and 
some 
nonspecialists were spreading confusion by making statements or 
replying to questions asked by reporters. 
  Complaining that some newspapers twisted statements in this 
regard, Ms Bhutto said that from now onward, no one except 
herself would speak directly on the issue. "Even the foreign 
minister will give a written statement on the subject so that no 
one can twist it," she said and added that if any cabinet member 
had to reply to any question on the issue he should seek its 
answer from the foreign minister. 
  "Statements are printed to create confusion and that's why 
we 
say enough is enough," she added. 
  Ms Bhutto said that first a statement on rolling back 
Pakistan's nuclear programme was published and, though the 
government denied it, it was made an issue. "They want to trap 
us by (printing) such statements" 
  The Prime Minister regretted that every Tom, Dick and Harry 
had become an expert on this specialised subject. "They use 
terms like freezing, capping and rolling back, so loosely that 
Pakistan's interest is hurt."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Program and the Prime Minister's </F>
Credibility"] 
  [Text] In an interview with the GULF NEWS, former Army 
Chief General Aslam Beg claimed that during the tenure of her 
previous government, Ms. Benazir Bhutto withheld research on the 
nuclear missile program. He added that despite that order, work 
on the manufacture of long-range nuclear missiles continued for 
one year until August 1991. Efforts were also made to acquire 
M-11 missiles from China. But they were not successful at that 
time. Gen. Beg also explained that since the United States is 
trying to deprive Pakistan of a means to carry a nuclear warhead 
by suspending the supply of F-16's, the armed forces of Pakistan 
should give priority to the manufacture of missiles to carry 
warheads. According to Gen. Beg, research had been continuing 
until the end of his term despite Ms. Benazir Bhutto, in her 
capacity as the prime minister, banning it. 
  Gen. Beg's revelation requires the prime minister to take 
the 
nation into confidence and to explain why she issued orders 
against the production of missiles, which are so indispensable 
for the defense of the country and the nation. Earlier, Ms. 
Bhutto herself revealed that during her previous tenure of 
office she helped Rajiv Gandhi crush the Sikh freedom movement. 
Reports have also appeared now about Ms. Bhutto capping 
Pakistan's nuclear program during her previous term of office. 
These reports will definitely create doubts and apprehensions 
among the people about the credibility of Ms. Bhutto as a 
national leader and prime minister of Pakistan. Therefore, it is 
imperative upon Ms. Bhutto to make necessary clarifications on 
the television and try to remove doubts and misgivings. 
  The Pakistani nation is much more sensitive than India on 
defense matters and there is a national consensus that we must 
be equipped with a nuclear deterrent to protect ourselves from 
Indian aggression. The nation rejected the recent U.S. pressure 
and it is not ready to allow an inspection of its nuclear 
installations in exchange for F-16's. The government should not 
make any mistake in realizing the sentiments of the nation and 
the needs of the country. 
  The reports published the other day about the meeting of the 
troika -- the president, the prime minister, and the army chief 
-- in connection with the upcoming visit of President Farooq 
Leghari to the United States are not at all a matter of 
satisfaction for the nation. These reports said that the 
government formulated a policy of rejecting a unilateral roll 
back of the nuclear program. The fact is that Pakistan cannot 
roll back its nuclear program even bilaterally, let alone 
unilaterally. First of all, India will not agree to it. The 
second is that Pakistan is several times weaker than India even 
in terms of conventional forces and weapons. Therefore, progress 
in the nuclear field should be our only aim in order to ensure 
the security of our nation and the protection of our country's 
independence.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "President Leghari's Visit and Pakistan-U.S. </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari said that 
the nation is unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and no 
government can make any decision ignoring this consensus. He 
said that Pakistan will not tolerate any unilateral pressure or 
discriminatory treatment over its nuclear program. The 
president was addressing a gathering of Pakistani 
representatives of professional institutions of North America 
and Canada in Rochester, New York. The president said that 
Pakistan-U.S. relations are not confined to a single dimension; 
they are multidimensional. He said that his talks with U.S. 
authorities will cover all aspects. 
  Pakistan has been spelling out its position on the nuclear 
program for years, especially since the U.S. Government stopped 
economic and military aid four years ago on the pretext of the 
Pressler Amendment and refused to deliver the F-16 planes which 
were purchased by Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan tried to 
convince the United States about the peaceful nature of its 
nuclear program and clarified its stand at various levels that 
not only is Pakistan's nuclear program peaceful, but the nation 
is unanimous about it also. Moreover, Pakistan is ready to 
implement any proposal on declaring the South Asian region a 
nuclear-free zone which is also acceptable to India. 
  Despite these clarifications, Pakistan has so far failed to 
persuade the U.S. Administration to stop enforcing the Pressler 
Amendment. Of course, the success it has achieved is that the 
United States is not pressuring Pakistan now to roll back its 
nuclear program unilaterally. This is an important and positive 
change in the U.S. attitude. However, the United States should 
also admit that the Pressler Amendment cannot bring an end to 
the arms race and halt attempts to manufacture nuclear weapons 
in South Asia. Neither did implementing the law against Pakistan 
prove helpful nor did it conform to the requirements of justice. 
Similarly, the United States should also realize that the 
people and various sections and circles in parliament are 
unanimous about Pakistan's nuclear program and it is therefore 
impossible to terminate the program by exerting pressure on the 
government. 
  During his current visit, President Farooq Ahmad Leghari is 
scheduled to hold extensive talks with U.S. authorities on a 
number of issues other than Pakistan's nuclear program. It is 
expected that our position will become clearer to the U.S. 
Government as a result of these talks. We also hope that the 
U.S. president will review the situation as a result of the 
Pakistani president's talks and not only supply the F-16 planes, 
but also stop making unjust and inequitable demands concerning 
the nuclear program issue. 
  Our position is that our nuclear program is peaceful and is 
presently in a frozen state. The United States is free to 
verify if it wants, using technical means provided it does not 
affect Pakistan's proclaimed nuclear program. It is hoped that 
President Leghari's visit will enable Pakistan and the United 
States to come closer to each other, boost the process of 
understanding, and help remove the prevailing misunderstanding. 
We also hope that the opposition will not become a victim of 
unjustified misunderstanding, nor will it create an impression 
which is contrary to reality. 
  As President Leghari has stated in recent interviews with 
"JANG" and "THE NEWS," all centers of power in Pakistan are 
sending the same hints and identical signals to the outside 
world and it is clear that Pakistan's stand is being devised by 
all centers of power jointly. Therefore, no one should have a 
misunderstanding or apprehension that any particular individual 
or circle can adopt or declare a unilateral stand on the nuclear 
issue. The whole nation should remain satisfied that any 
decision will be made with the consensus of all centers of power 
and nothing will be accepted which is not in the national 
interests.

<F P=106> [Report by Falih al-Saghir and Sa'ud al-Rayyis from Aden] </F>
  [Excerpt] Officials in Aden have welcomed international 
moves to halt the fighting in Yemen. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, 
named by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid as his deputy, said 
in a telephone interview with AL-YAWM that, for now, 
international intervention is the only way to stop the war. 
  Al-Jifri predicted imminent international recognition of 
south Yemen's secession. He said delay in recognition was 
natural in view of the rapid succession of developments in Yemen. 
  'Ali Salim al-Bid stood ready to meet with President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih anywhere, on condition that the meeting 
coincided with a cease-fire and a pullback by northern forces to 
the pre-unity lines. Victims of the offensive on Shabwah 
Governorate showed symptoms indicating the use of chemical 
weapons, al-Jifri said. 
  The southern official said he thought it unlikely that 
northern forces would enter Aden, citing strong defenses, rather 
than political considerations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- Kazakhstan wants to invite 
U.S. experts to dismantle Russian-made nuclear missiles which it 
had inherited from the former Soviet Union and the decision 
causes concern among the Russian military. 
  "The access of experts of third countries to Russian missile 
complexes for their dismantling contradicts the Russian-Kazakh 
agreement on strategic nuclear forces and the treaty on military 
cooperation", Aleksandr Volkov, first deputy commander-in-chief 
of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces, told TASS on Tuesday. 
  Russian experts are currently removing nuclear warheads from 
the missiles, extracting them from silos and preparing for 
transportation, according to Volkov who added that Russia had 
pledged to transfer to its territory all nuclear components for 
elimination by May 1, 1995. He stressed that financial aspects 
of dismantling and elimination have been fixed in a separate 
Russian- Kazakh agreement. 
  In the meantime, three U.S. companies want to eliminate the 
SS-18 missiles in Kazakhstan and are planning to request the 
U.S. Congress to appropriate 75 million dollars for that, 
according to Kazakh mass media which reported that the main bulk 
of the missiles is to be destroyed, while ten of them are to be 
used as spacecraft carriers. The Kazakh-U.S. cooperation idea in 
the sphere has emerged after the visit of President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev to the United States. 
  The invitation to U.S. experts to dismantle Russian missiles 
affects not only the Russian interests, but also of missile 
constructors in other CIS countries. According to Aleksandr 
Piskunov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on 
defence, the Kazakh decision ignores the right to intellectual 
property and thus contradicts international norms.

  [Text] The Americans have offered Russia assistance in 
building a burial site for radioactive waste. However, they 
have also stated that nuclear waste from the United States 
should be accepted at the burial site as a condition for doing 
so. Germany has also come forward with a similar proposal. 
Viktor Kutsenko, a representative of the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection and Natural Resources, said this in an 
interview for the RIA agency. He stressed that Russia would not 
agree to the country being turned into a dumping ground for 
nuclear waste.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 25 TASS -- Russia cannot agree with a 
recent U.S. proposal on an international control system which 
will be necessary if an international agreement on stopping 
nuclear arms tests is concluded, ITAR-TASS learnt on Wednesday 
from reliable Russian sources participating now in the U.N. 
disarmament conference in the Japanese city of Hiroshima. 
  The multilateral talks to conclude an international 
agreement 
on stopping nuclear tests which started in Geneva last January, 
centre on a system of control. 
  According to the above sources, the American side recently 
offered its own model of control which presupposes the 
simultaneous application of six verification systems and the 
establishment of appropriate global structures. 
  Russian experts believe that it will take at least ten years 
to implement the U.S.-brokered model. Besides, it presupposes 
huge financial outlays, which is objected not only by Russia but 
also by other nuclear powers. 
  In contrast to Washington, Moscow believes that the 
application of two systems -- seismic and atmospheric control -- 
is quite sufficient. According to these sources, this viewpoint 
is backed by many participants in the nuclear tests talks in 
Geneva, including Japan. 
  The U.S. proposal, the official reply to which Moscow plans 
to give in the next few days, puts in jeopardy, as the sources 
stressed, the chance of the timely signing of the Nuclear Non- 
Proliferation Treaty which expires next year. 
  This is explained by the fact that most treaty participants, 
members of the Non-Aligned Movement in the main, insist that the 
nuclear powers should conclude an agreement on stopping nuclear 
tests. They agree to prolong the treaty for unlimited duration 
only under this condition.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 24 TASS -- Completely stopping nuclear 
tests, production of fissionable materials for military 
purposes, and enhancing in every possible way an international 
dialogue on strategical stability have now become top priority 
tasks for nuclear powers, Chief of the Analysis and Prognosis 
Department in the Russian Foreign Ministry Ednan Agayev said at 
the U.N. disarmament conference which opened in the Japanese 
city of Hiroshima today. 
  Agayev noted that now the nuclear restraining philosophy 
does 
not serve as a factor greatly influencing interrelations between 
Russia and the United States, and expressed the opinion that 
largest nuclear powers are now gradually reconsidering their 
concepts of nuclear restraint. In particular, it is testified 
by the fact that they are adhering to the moratorium on nuclear 
tests, which was until now considered to be an indispensible 
part of the nuclear strategy, he added. "It would be naive to 
think that international negotiations on banning nuclear tests 
within the conference on disarmament framework, which are 
underway in Geneva, will move ahead easily and speedily," the 
high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official noted. "But the 
rejection of nuclear tests by all states will, undoubtedly, help 
successfully holding them," he said. 
  Agayev said limiting and stopping production of fissionable 
materials for military purposes is one of the most important 
efforts made in this direction by nuclear powers. "The 
fulfillment of this task could become a reality, if nuclear 
powers would look at their nuclear arsenals as an attribute of 
history and actively seek for their reduction," he said. 
  Touching upon the problem of international security under 
conditions of a gradual reduction in nuclear weapons, the 
Russian official emphasised the importance of the dialogue on 
strategical stability which Russia is continuing currently not 
only with the United States and other nuclear powers, but also 
with such countries as Germany and Japan. Consultations on 
security with the participation of military and intelligence 
departments' representatives might help strengthen mutual trust 
and expedite cuts in nuclear arsenals, he added. 
  "The dialogue on strategical stability helps elicit ideas 
which might form the basis of a new concept of security that is 
called on to replace nuclear restraint," the Russian diplomat 
noted.

  [Text] The Chechen president has again spoken of the 
Russian threat. Dzhokhar Dudayev has stated that the Russian 
special services are drawing up a plan to organize an 
underground nuclear explosion on the republic's territory. 
Speaking on Groznyy television, Dudayev claimed that the 
special services may well implement this plan since their 
previously prepared attempt to physically remove the Chechen 
president ended in failure. During his appearance on television 
Dudayev expressed the opinion that if this plan for a localized 
nuclear explosion in Chechnya is carried out then the Russian 
special services will blame the republic's leadership for it, 
basing their statements on previously disseminated 
disinformation that Chechnya supposedly has components for 
nuclear weapons. The Russian foreign intelligence service has 
already categorically denied Dudayev's claims. 
  Incidentally, President Dudayev issued a decree today 
introducing a curfew throughout the territory of the republic 
from 2200 local time.

  [Text] Moscow June 1 TASS -- The Russian foreign 
intelligence service denied Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
allegations on Wednesday that Russian secret services are 
planning to stage a local nuclear explosion in the Chechen 
Republic. 
  "Such statements are absurd," foreign intelligence 
spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis said. 
  Dudayev said on Chechen television that following the failed 
attempt on his life, Russian secret services may stage a local 
nuclear blast. He also said that should this happen, they will 
then accuse the Chechen Republic, saying that it possesses a 
nuclear component.

  [Text] Russia strictly follows the strategy of mutually 
beneficial cooperation on the world raw uranium and uranium 
technologies market, and is willing to take part in setting a 
price quota, which would take into consideration the interests 
of other countries, said Viktor Mikhaylov, Russian minister for 
nuclear energy, speaking at the opening in St. Petersburg of the 
21st international conference "The World Market for Nuclear 
Fuel." 
  ITAR-TASS reports that the forum, held in Russia for the 
first time, is attended by experts from 20 countries. For two 
days they will debate the reconstruction of the nuclear industry 
on the global level, bearing in mind the development of nuclear 
stations in both Europe and South-East Asia, as well as Russia's 
emergence on the world market of uranium fuel.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 20 TASS -- Chairman of the Russian 
Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko decided to personally look 
into the state of affairs in the Russian Armed Forces on the eve 
of the upper chamber's examination of the military budget. On 
Friday he left for the Ivanovo region, where a missile army is 
stationed. 
  Shumeyko was accompanied on his trip by commander-in-chief 
of 
the strategic missile troops Colonel-General Igor Sergeyev. The 
missile army is partly armed with the newest "Topol" missile 
system, destined to become the core of Russia's future strategic 
missile forces. 
  Igor Sergeyev told ITAR-TASS that today's talks between the 
missile troops command and Vladimir Shumeyko would center around 
the problems faced by those troops. These problems, he said, 
"are rooted in the share of the budget which is to be allotted 
the strategic missile troops". 
  Shumeyko will be shown the troops' battle capabilities and 
the main components of the training which those who are 
entrusted with the country's nuclear weapons must undergo. The 
Federation Council chairman intends to meet with some of the 
army's officers as well. 
  Sergeyev said he was grateful to Shumeyko for deciding to 
first visit the strategic missile units before making a decision 
on the military budget. "That is explainable, since the Russian 
military doctrine lays the most responsibility for the state's 
safety and stategic stability on our forces. The strategic 
missile troops are the main component of Russia's strategic 
nuclear forces", the general said. 
  He further noted that the many problems encountered by the 
troops are being resolved without compromising their battle 
capabilities and reliability. The strategic missile troops had 
to shoulder most of the responsibility under the START-1 and 
START-2 international disarmament treaties. 
  At present, the commander-in-chief explained, about 60 per 
cent of the rocket carriers and warheads of the strategic 
nuclear forces are concentrated in the missile troops. These 
types of weapons are due to be reduced to one-sixth their former 
size. Sergeyev also pointed out that, even without any 
international treaties, Russia would have to eliminate the 
weapons which used to be produced in the other ex-Soviet 
Republics. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev declared at a recent 
press conference that the country's strategic nuclear forces 
were the main guarantee of Russia's security in the modern 
world. At present as well as in the future, the top priority in 
the development of the armed forces will be given to strategic 
nuclear weapons, which are the main deterrent factor against any 
outbreak of hostilities, he said. 
  The divisions and regiments of the strategic missile troops, 
which are at the centre of the nuclear forces, are now being 
technically reequipped. In the last two years, seven more 
missile regiments have been made battle-capable, all equipped 
with new stationary and mobile missile systems. 
  At the same time, strategic missile units are being 
withdrawn 
from the other ex-Soviet Republics. By the end of 1994, another 
four missile regiments are due to be relocated to Russian 
territory.

the two months' arrears in wages or the fire-fighters decline 
responsibility for protecting the nuclear reactors of the

unscheduled shutdown of the reactors could entail unpredictable 
consequences. The "Obninskgorgaz," to which the nuclear research 
center is also in debt, has threatened to stop gas supplies.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kuvardin report; from the "Pacific Ocean" program] </F>
  [Text] Our listeners are sure to know that a joint 
Russian-Japanese commission on problems of storage and 
utilization of liquid radioactive waste -- ZHRO [zhidkiye 
radioaktivnyye otkhody] for short -- worked in April in Tokyo, 
Vladivostok, and Bolshoy Kamen. Two variants for the utilization 
of liquid radioactive waste are being developed, and the final 
variant will be chosen in mid-May. Japan undertakes its 
financing. 
  I met this week with Stanislav Nikolayevich Pechugin, chief 
engineer of the Murmansk repair and technological enterprise of 
the nuclear fleet, who was on a business trip in our city. This 
is the talk that we had: [begin recording] 
  Pechugin: A convention forbidding the dumping of 
ZHRO into seas and oceans began to be implemented in 1986-87. 
According to this convention, the ice breaking nuclear fleet 
must stop its activity completely, or somehow find a solution 
for purifying liquid radioactive waste. There are technical 
service vessels in the fleet, among them tankers, where the ZHRO 
is accumulated. But it cannot be accumulated indefinitely, and 
the Murmansk Maritime Steamship Company decided -- our 
enterprise was a part of the steamship company at that time -- 
to deal with this problem itself. In other words, the problem 
was being solved at the state level. Money for planning and 
building a special water purification system at our enterprise 
was allocated. However, we were still at the planning stage at 
the time, and the end of construction was still far away. Our 
enterprise and the Murmansk Steamship Company invited three 
Moscow scientific research institutes to solve the problem. The 
problem cannot be called a new one because nuclear power 
stations have been working for a long time, and they were 
solving the problem of purifying their ZHRO. However, they have 
their own specific problems. There was still no solution to the 
question of processing the ZHRO of transportation nuclear 
reactors. Our enterprise has created an experimental industrial 
facility for purifying liquid radioactive waste. At present, 
this is a facility of small capacity of about 1,500 cubic meters 
a year. It needs further development. We have been purifying 
liquid nuclear waste produced at ice breakers and at our 
facility since 1988, and today neither the steamship company nor 
our facility has any liquid waste, and that being produced is 
immediately purified. Therefore, the accumulated waste in the 
tankers of the nuclear technological fleet has all been 
processed. Today, we need certain means to complete our 
facility. However, all our efforts were directed at purifying 
radionuclides, and problems of pure chemistry and the tail 
process, that is, of solidifying of the still residue [kubovyy 
ostatok] were not solved. Today, it is possible to complete it, 
but lack of funds prevents us from doing so. 
  A conference initiated by heads of the Murmansk and 
Arkhangelsk Oblast administrations was held in February in 
Arkhangelsk. All specialists of transportation nuclear 
facilities were invited, and Nuclear Energy Minister Mikhaylov 
was present. Among other things, solutions for the ZHRO problem 
was discussed. A decision has been adopted that after the 
appropriate expertise and presentation of substantiations, the 
problem of northern basin ZHRO would be solved at our facility. 
In other words, we will become the main organization for 
purifying ZHRO of both the civil nuclear fleet and the Navy, and 
also of defense [word indistinct] enterprises. 
  Kuvardin: Stanislav Nikolayevich, do Zvezda plant 
specialists know of your enterprise? 
  Pechugin: I will not speak for them, but the 
general designer of the [word indistinct] knows it very well, 
since they designed some of our facilities. 
  Kuvardin: Given time, they could adopt some of 
your experience. 
  Pechugin: Yes, probably. I talked to the Zvezda 
plant KIP [monitoring and testing center] on the telephone 
before leaving for Vladivostok, and they asked me to accept 
their specialists to study our facility. We did not refuse, but 
these things are still not done free of charge today. I think 
that we will reach an agreement.

  [Text] St. Petersburg May 27 TASS -- Special titanic 
[Moscow Radio Rossii Network in Russian at 0900 GMT on 27 May 
1994 describes the "titanic" plugs as "titanium"] plugs from St. 
Petersburg will be used to prevent the leak of plutonium from 
the nuclear torpedo warheads aboard the sunken Russian submarine 
"Komsomolets." They should seal the openings in the fore part 
of the submarine, which is resting at the depth of 1700 meters. 
  The devices have rubber compacters which should, according 
to 
those who worked on the project, reduce the circulation of water 
currents in the shattered hull of the boat. That, in turn, will 
put a brake on the destruction of the torpedo shells. As a 
result, the likelihood that products of corrosion will wash away 
the plutonium and pollute the underwater ecological system with 
radioactive toxic waste will be decreased. 
  The first titanic "plugs" have already been taken on board 
the research ship "Academic Mstislav Keldysh." The ship is 
supposed to quit the St. Petersburg harbor in about a month and 
set course for the burial site of the atomic submarine. 
  ITAR-TASS was told by Igor Spasskiy, head of the Central 
Naval Technology Design Bureau, that the devices will be 
installed in the "Komsomolets" with the help of the "Mir" 
underwater manned apparatuses, which are equipped with external 
manipulators. 
  The scientists also plan to carry out detailed radiation 
monitoring. The hydrological station which has been near the 
submarine for the past year will be hoisted on board the 
research ship. There the scientists will analyze the station's 
information about hydrodynamic processes and the speed and 
direction of ocean currents in an effort to get a good picture 
of the real condition of the sunken submarine.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- Members of 
Ukraine's working delegation to Washington attended a briefing 
at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on 17 May. Ukraine's Deputy Prime 
Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who led the delegation, believes the 
signing of the memorandum on mutual understanding between the 
governments of Ukraine and the United States on the transfer of 
missile equipment and technology has become an important step in 
Ukraine's accession to the world distribution of labor in the 
implementation of space programs, since no country owns a 
complete production cycle in this area. The document also 
illustrates the fact that "Ukraine has joined the group of 
civilized countries, instead of falling to the level of Iraq or 
North Korea." 
  In the course of negotiations, the Ukrainian side managed to 
persuade the United States to lift the clause in the agreement 
on space cooperation between the United States and Russia that 
concerns the countries of the former Soviet Union as one which 
infringes upon the rights of the third party. 
  Giving a generally favorable assessment of the trip's 
results, Valeriy Kazakov, deputy minister of machine-building, 
military- industrial complex, and conversion, said that despite 
U.S. assurances of a fine state of relations between the United 
States and Ukraine, economic cooperation and work in the sphere 
of conversion is proceeding slowly. A great deal of attention 
during the visit was paid to the intensification of conversion 
programs. For example, it was possible to agree to a list of 35 
enterprises subject to immediate restructuring. The U.S. side 
has allocated 20 million dollars to this end. 
  Asked by UNIAN to comment on the breakthrough in the U.S. 
attitude to Ukraine, Deputy Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk said 
it reflected international reality and our country's consistent 
policy stance. Tarasyuk emphasized that this change began after 
the signing of the trilateral statement by Ukraine, Russia, and 
the United States.

  [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The People's Movement 
of Ukraine [RUKh] circulated an appeal to the Council for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe and the UN Security Council 
  "Events that have recently taken place in the Crimean 
autonomous republic, which is an inalienable and constituent 
part of the Ukrainian state, are testimony of the real 
possibility of the region turning into a zone of permanent 
threat to peace and stability in Europe", the document says. 
The authors of the appeal note that "flagrant violations of 
Ukraine's constitution based on including on the agenda for a 
session of the Supreme Council of Crimea issues on the creation 
of Crimea's own armed forces, the introduction of dual 
citizenship, completely ignoring the interests of the indigenous 
Crimean Tatar and the Ukrainian population, and the redeployment 
of military formations from the territory of Russia to the 
Crimean peninsula, are acts aimed at violating civic peace on 
the territory of Crimea thus creating the grounds for the 
emergence of an armed conflict." 
  In RUKh's view, the situation arose as a result of direct 
and 
permanent interference by state officials of the Russian 
Federation in the affairs of a neighboring state. The Black Sea 
Fleet is being used by Russia as an instrument of forced 
pressure. 
  Vyacheslav Chornovil, who signed the appeal, stressed that 
under these conditions the "process of the further withdrawal of 
nuclear warheads from Ukraine in accordance with the trilateral 
agreement should be suspended". 
  RUKh appeals to the Council for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe and the UN Security Council since, in RUKh's view, "only 
the intervention of institutions that are called on to maintain 
security in Europe can defend peace in the region and prevent 
the creation of a new zone of international tension."

Complex"] 
  [Text] Realizing our responsibility before Ukraine in 
providing the national economy with electricity and 
realistically assessing the conditions that are necessary for 
the atomic plants to cope with the load during the fall and 
winter periods of 1994-95, leaders of the atomic power 
engineering complex state the following: 
  1. The fulfillment of the state plan for producing 
electricity in 1994 is impossible for the following reasons: 
  -- there are no funds for purchasing nuclear fuel or spare 
parts; 
  -- the Power Engineering Ministry's debt to atomic plants 
constitutes 1.7 trillion karbovantsi; 
  -- the rate for the electricity produced by atomic plants 
does not even make it possible to satisfy minimal needs [of 
power engineers]. 
  2. The failure to finance operational outlays will result in 
the need to stop a number of power units (five out of 12). 
  3. The following is necessary to ensure the provision with 
nuclear fuel, proper repairs, and timely commissioning of power 
units: 
  -- to increase the share of convertible currency capital 
allocated on the terms of tender; 
  -- to issue state credits to the Ministry of Power 
Engineering to enable it to pay debts to atomic plants; 
  -- to raise the rates for the electricity produced by atomic 
electric power plants [AES]. 
  4. The above questions require immediate consideration and 
resolution.

Energy; 
  V. Bronnykov, General Director of the Production Association

Service: "Radiation for Consumption Off the Premises"] 
  [Text] As already reported, a capsule containing 
cesium-137, which is a part of the control and measurement 
equipment in the furnace for quicklime slaking, had been stolen 
from the Nikolayev Alumina Plant. In accordance with tentative 
data, several persons, who are yet to be identified in the 
course of investigation, stole a steel capsule from the 
equipment, fixed it in a screw-vise in the workshop and tried to 
pulverize it in the hope that it contained a precious metal. 
The hermetic seal of the capsule was broken. The offenders 
threw its fragments into the fire-prevention reservoir filled 
with water. As a result of the actions, the reservoir and the 
adjacent premises of the plant were contaminated. 
  After the disappearance of the capsule became known, the 
territory of the plant was thoroughly examined. Places of 
radioactive contamination were pinpointed. Their total area 
amounts to 25 square meters. The territory around the reservoir 
was covered with concrete. There is no danger of spread of the 
radioactive contamination. 
  Eleven persons were exposed to various doses of radiation. 
Three workers were hospitalized in the Kharkiv Radiological 
Institute. None of those affected was diagnosed as suffering 
from "radiation disease." A criminal case was initiated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jacques Baumel Puts His Foot Down"] </F>
  [Text] In line with his credo, the Gaullist Jacques Baumel 
has decided to put his foot down. The RPR [Rally for the 
Republic] deputy chairman of the parliamentary defense committee 
on Saturday tabled an amendment to the bill for the military 
programming law for the period 1995-2000, stressing the need to 
resume nuclear testing. 
  During a televised interview on 10 May, Francois Mitterrand 
nonetheless said with regard to the resumption of nuclear 
testing: "Where such a serious issue is concerned, if Parliament 
or the government were to significantly disagree with me, I 
would ask the people to decide." The head of state did not 
specify whether this call to the people would come in the form 
of a referendum or if he would dissolve the National Assembly. 
  Jacques Baumel's amendment mentions the need for a 
"resumption of nuclear testing" to acquire the means of 
simulating tests. Before coming up for general debate, the 
amendment is to be examined this morning by the defense 
committee. The deputy explained: "I am trying to clear up the 
skillfully maintained confusion according to which a simulation 
device" such as the PALEN (Preparation of a Limitation of 
Nuclear Testing) system can be acquired "without testing." He 
recognized that no experiments could be carried out before the 
end of Francois Mitterrand's term of office. Jacques Baumel 
stressed that this delay "does not, however, mean that tests 
should not be planned for a later stage in order to preserve the 
future," and he reiterated that the planning law covered six 
years.

  [Excerpts] Senate Speaker Rene Monory (UDF-CDS [Union for 
French Democracy-Social Democratic Center]) thinks that the idea 
of a referendum on employment launched by Philippe Seguin (RPR 
[Rally for the Republic]), his National Assembly counterpart, is 
"too simple." Mr. Monory, who was the guest on the Radio-J 
"Forum" program on Sunday, 15 May, said: "Employment deserves 
more than passing comments. It requires a series of measures. 
We must stop indulging in demagoguery and controversy.... I 
think that the majority and opposition should not taunt each 
other with each other's failures." The Senate speaker hopes 
that the presidential election will provide the opportunity "for 
a great debate" on this employment question. "Otherwise, we 
will be heading for decline," he said. [passage omitted] 
  Questioned on the disagreement between the prime minister 
and 
the president of the Republic on the question of the moratorium 
on nuclear tests, Mr. Monory expressed the view that this 
controversy is "rather pointless" because "our decision," he 
said, "is determined more than ever by the attitude of our big 
partners." Taking up the argument used by Francois Mitterrand 
during his 10 May television speech, he added: "It is true that 
if the others do not resume the tests, we will not resume them, 
and if the others do resume them, we will resume them." 
  On the question of the European elections, the Senate 
speaker, who had supported Dominique Baudis as candidate to head 
the UDF-RPR [Rally for the Republic] list, thinks that "35 
percent" would be "a good score."

  [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- France reserves the right to 
resume nuclear testing, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said on 
Tuesday, opening a debate in parliament on the country's 
military programme from 1995 until 2000. 
  Balladur said France was "not committed by any international 
constraint" on nuclear testing," alluding to a dispute between 
his right-wing government and socialist President Francois 
Mitterrand, who opposes a resumption of tests. 
  "I can assure you that this freedom of choice (to resume 
testing) will be preserved," Balladur said. 
  France has observed a moratorium on nuclear testing since 
April 1992, along with the United States, Russia and Britain. 
China carried out a nuclear test on October 5 last year. 
  Mitterrand, who under the constitution has sole power to 
decide on testing, said recently his successor would in any case 
be unable to order a resumption because his hands would be tied 
by the 1995 renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to 
be followed by a nuclear test ban treaty. 
  Mitterrand will step down in May 1995 and his successor is 
expected to be a conservative. 
  Balladur told parliament that the military planning bill, 
which calls for an increase in spending of 0.5 percent, urged "a 
major unprecedented effort" to simulate and miniaturise the 
nuclear weapons of the future which would guarantee "the 
credibility of our nuclear arsenal." 
  The Gaullist component of the ruling right-wing coalition, 
the Rally for the Republic (RPR), has campaigned for a 
resumption of testing, but RPR parliamentary leader Bernard Pons 
said Tuesday his government would vote for the bill. 
  Nuclear test campaigner Jacques Baumel, vice-chairman of the 
National Assembly's defence committee, would agree to withdraw 
an amendment calling for a resumption of tests in 1995 to 
acquire simulation capacity, Pons said. 
  He said an overwhelming majority of RPR MPs favoured a 
resumption of testing to develop a system of simulation, but 
that it would be up to the next president to decide. 
  Defence Minister Francois Leotard told parliament Tuesday 
that in 2000, France would have the second biggest defense 
budget in the West, after the United States, and "the biggest 
force on the European continent." 
  He said there would be nearly 580,000 soldiers and civilians 
serving in the armed forces.

  [Text] Paris, May 17 (AFP) -- French Defense Minister 
Francois Leotard said Tuesday that the scientific community 
believed additional nuclear tests were essential in order to 
develop the capacity to simulate tests in the laboratory. 
  Leotard, speaking on French radio, said that "the scientific 
community tells us that we need a few more tests," and added 
that he had not met a single scientist who believes otherwise. 
  "France must acquire as quickly as possible -- perhaps in 
seven, eight or 10 years -- the capacity to simulate tests that 
would allow us to test the effects of a nuclear explosion," 
Leotard said. "That is essential for our country if we are to 
remain a major power." 
  He said those opposed to nuclear testing are generally 
"politicians," an apparent reference to President Francois 
Mitterrand who is against France resuming nuclear [sentence as 
received]. 
  Mitterrand, who has exclusive powers to order tests, wants 
to 
stand by a moratorium observed by all the United Nations 
Security Council members except China.

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg at the beginning of May is weapon-grade 
material. As DPA learned from a well-informed source on Friday 
[27 May], the material, which was not recognized by the 
authorities for weeks, is 56 grams of plutonium-239 in powder 
form. According to the information, the highly poisonous 
material was found during the search of an apartment in Tengen 
near Konstanz in the course of investigations involving money 
forging. [passage omitted] 
  So far, no information has been provided about the origin of 
the material. On Thursday the Environment Ministry announced 
that the material probably came from Eastern Europe. The Land 
Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) in Stuttgart, which is 
responsible for the investigations, has announced that it will 
issue a statement on Friday. The Konstanz Public Prosecutor's 
Office has not commented so far. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Stuttgart (DPA) -- The plutonium seized during 
the search of an apartment in Baden-Wuerttemberg in May is 
suitable for the construction of a nuclear bomb. [passage

  The Land Office of Criminal Investigations (LKA) and the 
Konstanz Public Prosecutor's Office have meanwhile announced 
that the highly dangerous material was found during the search 
of an apartment on 10 May in the course of investigating a case 
of counterfeiting money. The plutonium was stored in a 
cylindrical lead container that weighs 4.5 kg, is 11 cm tall, 
and was closed with a steel band. 
  According to the investigating authorities, the owner of the 
apartment that was searched, a 52-year-old German businessman is 
in detention pending trial on suspicion of dealing in 
counterfeit money. During questioning, he claimed that the 
powder is a substance for refining metal. The LKA in Stuttgart 
has stated that the investigations of the counterfeiting affair 
are conducted by the Bavarian LKA. The Baden-Wuerttemberg 
authorities had only provided legal aid. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Defense Ministry in Bonn wants to ease the 
strict German arms control restrictions. A Defense Ministry 
strategy document envisages the founding of a European agency to 
make future decisions on all arms exports. 
  Correspondent C. Meincke: The detour via Europe is 
intended to open up new sales markets for German arms products. 
The confidential Defense Ministry strategy document for the 
planned European arms agency says that the project would only 
make sense if national restrictions were lifted. However, this 
would also involve an amendment to the Maastricht Treaty, which 
lays down that production of and trade in war materials are 
governed by national laws. Thus, in future the agency alone 
should make decisions on arms deals. This would mean for 
example that the loose French restrictions could also be applied 
to Germany. 
  Since the military strategists are aware of the reluctance 
of 
the British to enter into such close cooperation, they want to 
find a small club of determined partners, which will include 
above all France. The Defense Ministry predicts that trade 
being carried out through the arms agency would cost many jobs. 
This price would however have to be paid, since in free 
competition, the highly efficient German arms industry as a 
whole would probably emerge as a net profit-maker.

<F P=106> [`mes' report: "SPD: Expansion of Arms Exports"] </F>
  [Text] Bonn -- Government resolutions that could lead to a 
relaxation of the rules governing arms exports will have a 
bearing on parliament. On Thursday, the SPD [Social Democratic 
Party of Germany] spoke of a "major departure" from current 
practice concerning the granting of export permits, and demanded 
that the relevant Bundestag committees be informed. The reason 
is a decision by the Federal Security Council reached some time 
ago, whereby individual permission will no longer be required 
for deliveries of weapons parts to the 25 countries of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD]. 
  The Economics Ministry confirmed this resolution last week, 
and said that the Association of German Industry [BDI] would now 
be informed about it. BDI spokesman Volker Franzen welcomed the 
decision, saying that German enterprises would no longer be at a 
disadvantage vis-a-vis other European firms. On the other hand, 
Hermann Bachmaier, the SPD Bundestag faction's expert on arms 
exports controls, criticized the whole procedure, saying that 
the government's principles governing arms exports, laid down in 
1982 and never officially abolished, would thus be circumvented 
to a major extent. 
  According to the government's resolution, supplies of 
weapons 
parts to partner enterprises in the OECD will be permissible 
provided that the German share in the final product does not 
exceed 20 percent. This relaxation does not apply to nuclear, 
biological, and chemical weapons, nor to carrier systems. In 
addition, the partner firms are to reach agreement with each 
other on "which countries can and cannot receive supplies." The 
to-date practice of individual permits will continue to apply to 
exports of weapons to Third World countries. 
  The Economics Ministry claimed that the new rules lie 
"within 
the framework of the export-political principles" of 1982, 
adopted by the government of Helmut Schmidt. Without 
specifically mentioning the OECD, the Ministry said that the 
exports of armaments outside NATO remains restricted and, in 
particular, "may not lead to the expansion of export-capable 
armaments production capacity." Employment considerations should 
also play no special significance in exports of war weapons, it 
was said. 
  According to SPD deputy Buchmaier, the new resolutions will 
lead to a "massive expansion" of arms exports by German firms to 
areas beyond NATO. That would also make German weapons firms 
"indirectly" involved in weapons deliveries to the world's 
crisis spots. Buchmaier also referred to the Defense Ministry's 
"planning games" on the subject of establishing a European 
"Agency for Arms Exports." Plans like this would cause a further 
departure from the relatively strong German control criteria 
governing arms exports. 
  Apparently, German industry has been eagerly expecting the 
new regulations. In a statement replying to the government 
resolution, German Aerospnace said that European defense 
industries, beset by falling personnel levels, shrinking 
markets, and exploding costs, will be forced to adopt new forms 
of cooperation. "What is needed now is real Euro-firms that are 
capable of transcending all levels of depreciation and political 
borders, and can operate on the basis of their own 
entrepreneurial responsibility," said German Aerospace.

<F P=106> [Article signed BZ/BA/PO: "Following the Arrest of Romano </F>
Dolce. Swiss Authorities Deceived. Canton of Zurich Wants To 
Take Action."] 
  [Text] Como/Zurich, 23 May (ATS) -- The Deputy Public 
Prosecutor of Como (Italy), Romano Dolce, arrested last Friday, 
has probably duped the Swiss authorities for years. To hide his 
own fraudulent activities, he sent them wrong or incomplete 
information. The canton of Zurich wants to clear up the affair. 
  Marcel Bertschi, the Zurich public prosecutor, told ATS 
[Swiss Press Agency] on Monday that his office intends taking 
action, confirming a report in the Swiss-German weekly newspaper 
SONNTAGSZEITUNG. However, a spokesman for the Federal Justice 
and Police Department said that Italy has yet to ask Switzerland 
for international judicial cooperation. 
<H5>  Swiss Involvement </H5>
  Romano Dolce, aged 59, was arrested in Como by the town's 
police. He was well-known in Switzerland. He was in fact in 
charge of the investigation into the illegal trafficking of 
uranium, plutonium, and red mercury between Switzerland and 
Italy and between the countries of eastern Europe and Italy. 
  Together with five other people, including his secretary, an 
officer in the "Guardia di Finanza" (the financial police), Mr. 
Dolce stands accused of having participated in the illegal 
trafficking of arms, explosives, and radioactive material. 
According to the Como police, the network has branches in 
Switzerland and eastern Europe. 
<H5>  Swiss Authorities Duped </H5>
  Following his arrest, the Italian authorities explained to 
the press how Romano Dolce had duped his Swiss colleagues to 
cover his own tracks. 
  In 1991, for example, the magistrate had submitted false 
documents to the Swiss Justice Department concerning supposed 
trading in uranium, which led to the arrest of a Swiss 
businessman who was found carrying a sample of uranium. In 
fact, this maneuver had concealed a larger operation, diverting 
the attention of the Swiss authorities away from deals in which 
Romano Dolce was involved. 
  Also in 1991, according to SONNTAGSZEITUNG, the magistrate 
had similarly tipped off the Zurich police about a deal 
involving 30 kg of uranium. In 1992, in Como, he arrested a 
Swiss man carrying a sample of plutonium. The same year, a 
Swiss-Italian uranium traffic was uncovered, again on a tip-off 
from Romano Dolce. The material in question in fact turned out 
to be totally inoffensive. 
  For the time being, Romano Dolce remains under arrest. He 
has been put at the disposal of Brescia [Italy] magistrates 
since the Como prosecutor's office is not empowered to examine 
its own magistrate. The five people who stand accused with Mr. 
Dolce include the Italian Aldo Anghessa (aged 50), currently 
held in the La Stampa prison in Lugano.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (YONHAP) -- Inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] left Beijing for 
Pyongyang aboard a (North) Korean airways plane Tuesday [17 May] 
afternoon. 
  The three IAEA experts will conduct additional inspections 
of 
nuclear laboratories at Yongbyon, 100 km north of Pyongyang, and 
check whether nuclear fuel rods have been replaced at the 
North's 5-megawatt reactor. 
  The inspections, coming after a two-month pause, are 
important because they will determine whether the dispute over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program is referred to the United Nations 
Security Council for sanctions, or the United States and North 
Korea hold a third round of high-level talks. 
  Before departing for Pyongyang, the head of the IAEA 
inspectors stated that he can say nothing before the actual 
inspections, which will begin as soon as possible. 
  Western sources here said the IAEA experts may differ with 
North Korean officials on the scope of the inspections, but such 
disagreement will never be so serious as to block the holding of 
a third round of high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang. 
  North Korea is likely to employ the two undeclared nuclear 
facilities as a final card to be used in negotiations with the 
United States and the IAEA. Whether the North accepts 
inspections of the two undeclared sites will be the final issue 
to be resolved at the negotiations, the sources said. 
  Meanwhile, the three-man IAEA team will end the first stage 
of inspections by this weekend and report the results to agency 
headquarters in Vienna. This means a decision on the third 
round of high-level dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang 
will come next week at the latest.

  [Text] Yun Ho-chin, North Korean working-level 
representative on the nuclear issue, revealed on 17 May that 
North Korea has already replaced quite a few of its burnt 
nuclear fuel rods at the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon and 
that the replacement job will continue for the next two months. 
  When asked if the replacement is in the preparatory stages, 
Yun Ho-chin, councilor of the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, 
stated that the replacement work has progressed to the point 
that quite a few of its nuclear fuel rods have been replaced 
after being unsealed. 
  The North Korean councilor stressed that North Korea had 
emphasized the inevitability of the replacement to the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and had requested that 
IAEA inspectors observe the replacement of nuclear fuel rods on 
several occasions.

<F P=106> [Report by Mun Il-hyon from Beijing] </F>
  [Text] China warned on 17 May that "North Korea would 
likely take extreme action [kuktanjok haengdong] if Western 
countries intend to isolate North Korea." 
  A Japanese Social Party delegate said that in a meeting with 
a delegation led by Kubo Wataru, secretary general of Japanese 
Social Party, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said on 
17 May that "it is possible for North Korea to take a very 
extreme method [kuktanjok pangbop]," and that "the Western 
countries should fully consider such a situation." 
  Regarding the replacement of fuel rods at a five-megawatt 
reactor, which has aroused strong protest from Western 
countries, including the United States, Vice Foreign Minister 
Tang said: "North Korea seems to show a hard-line attitude, but, 
actually, there is room for the settlement of the nuclear 
issue." Accordingly, he has strongly hinted that North Korea has 
not yet carried out the work of replacing fuel rods at its 
nuclear reactor. 
  The Japanese Social Party official said that Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang said China is now actively making efforts for the 
success of North Korean-U.S. talks. 
  This is the first time China has openly expressed that it 
has 
played a behind the scenes role in resolving the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  Also, the Japanese Social Party official said Vice Foreign 
Minister Tang expressed that while President Kim Il-song was in 
China he said to Chinese leaders on many occasions that North 
Korea has no intention of developing nuclear weapons, nor does 
it have the funds or technology necessary, or the need to 
produce them. 
  Regarding this, a Chinese high-level source said that 
"considering the special relationship between China and North 
Korea, breaking the promise made between the leaders of the two 
countries would not be easy," and that "the Chinese leadership 
believes that President Kim Il-song will keep his promise." He 
has also clearly expressed that China adheres to a negative 
position on North Korea's nuclear development.

  [Text] Washington, May 17 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
informed the United States that it will allow the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to check the fuel rods taken out of 
its 5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon later, an official at 
the North Korean mission to the United Nations said on Tuesday 
[17 May]. 
  He said that although North Korea began to replace the fuel 
rods of the 5mw reactor in Yongbyon, it will seal the spent fuel 
and keep it under the IAEA's strict surveillance. 
  "We will then allow accurate measurement of the spent fuel 
when we and the United States comprehensively settle the nuclear 
problem in a package deal," he said. 
  The official reiterated the statement by a North Korean 
Foreign Ministry spokesman that Pyongyang had to begin replacing 
the fuel rods for reasons of technical safety. He also noted 
that the statement emphasized that the nuclear problem can still 
be solved through dialogue. 
  Thomas McLarty, chief of staff for U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, told a TV news program last weekend that Washington 
needs more information about North Korea's refueling and is 
waiting for reports from the IAEA team, which began its 
inspections on Tuesday. 
  The United States, however, may not have any alternative but 
to study ways at the U.N. Security Council to impose sanctions 
on North Korea if the IAEA inspection fails to come up with 
satisfactory results, diplomatic sources said.

  ["Reuter/YONHAP report from Vienna"] 
  [Text] On 17 May, one official at the North Korean Embassy 
in 
Vienna said that news reports that North Korea has already begun 
replacing fuel rods of the 5 megawatt nuclear reactor in 
Yongbyon are not true. 
  He said that news reports that used nuclear fuel rods have 
already been removed for installment of new ones are contrary to 
the truth. 
  But, he hinted that preparatory work to replace nuclear fuel 
rods at the Yongbyon nuclear reactor may have begun by now. 
  He added: "We do not know whether nuclear fuel rods are 
being 
replaced. But, it, if any, may be preparatory work. It takes 
two months to replace nuclear fuel rods." 
  In the meantime, the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] said that a team to inspect North Korea's nuclear 
facilities went to Yongbyon via Pyongyang on 18 May. 
  The inspection team will conduct inspections of the nuclear 
reprocessing facilities--whose inspections were held in check by 
the North Korean side last March--and will examine the 
surveillance camera installed at the nearby nuclear reactor. 
The IAEA side pointed out that such an examination alone can 
find out whether fuel rods at the nuclear reactor have been 
replaced or not.

  [Excerpts] Vienna, May 18 (AFP) -- UN nuclear inspectors 
who traveled to North Korea to determine if spent reactor fuel 
was diverted for bomb-making have begun their work, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday [18 May]. 
  A spokesman for the UN agency said the three inspectors had 
got down to their week-long assignment but he refused to provide 
details. 
  North Korea said over the weekend that it had already begun 
replacing spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 90 
kilometers (54 miles) north of Pyongyang. 
  The inspectors are pressing to check the rods to see if 
fissile material has been diverted to make a nuclear weapon. 
  North Korea denies having a nuclear weapons program. 
[passage 
omitted] 
  The IAEA says the operation could take a few months.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 (YONHAP) -- Russian Ambassador to 
South Korea Georgiy Kunadze said Wednesday that North Korea, as 
a member of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), should 
fulfill all of its obligations under the treaty. 
  He told a symposium in Tokyo titled "Peace and Stability in 
East Asia" that, even though North Korea has been insisting that 
it be given a special position ever since it announced its 
intention to withdraw from the NPT, there are no other positions 
in the international convention than that of either a member or 
a non-member. 
  His remarks were seen as tantamount to urging Pyongyang to 
accept full-fledged inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  "As a main member of the NPT, Russia will make the maximum 
effort in trying to see to it that nuclear weapons do not appear 
in Northeast Asia," he said. 
  But Kunadze struck a cautious note on the issue of sanctions 
against North Korea, saying that isolating the communist state 
might produce unwanted results. 
  Meanwhile, former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama 
pointed out that international countermeasures against North 
Korea, assuming that it persists in rejecting nuclear 
inspections, depend on the stances of Russia and China. 
  Japan's diplomatic ability, he added, will be tested as a 
result because Tokyo may have to control remittances from 
pro-Pyongyang Koreans in Japan to North Korea. 
  Professor Izmi Hazime addressed factors which could trigger 
a 
crisis should the nuclear standoff continue to drag on. 
  He said the major factors are whether North Korea could 
endure extreme economic difficulties and whether the United 
States could tolerate the situation. He captured attention by 
saying that the world needs to prepare to use military power 
under the worst-case scenario. 
  An Pyong-chun, a professor at South Korea's Yonsei 
University, said that in order to settle the nuclear problem 
North Korea should remain in the NPT, accept special inspections 
and agree to mutual checks with South Korea. 
  "Although not desirable," he added, "we can think of 
economic 
sanctions by the U.N. Security Council on North Korea. If the 
sanctions are imposed, Japan's exertion of its economic 
influence including suspension of remittances to North Korea is 
essential."

  [Text] Hans Meyer, spokesman of the International Atomic

begun inspecting Yongbyon nuclear facilities and that there has 
been no particular disturbance to speak of by North Korean 
authorities. 
  In a telephone interview with CHUNGANG ILBO on the early 
morning of 19 May, Spokesman Meyer said: "The three-member 
inspection team is communicating normally with the IAEA 
headquarters in Vienna, Austria." 
  He said the inspection team, which arrived in Pyongyang on 
17 
May and moved on to Yongbyon by automobile, is regularly 
reporting to the IAEA headquarters every afternoon about its 
inspection activities. 
  Asked about whether North Korea had begun the replacement of 
fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor in question, he said: 
"The IAEA's official position is that, until inspections are 
completed, we would not know which is the truth as Pyongyang 
asserted that it began the replacement of fuel rods while North 
Korean officials in Vienna are denying this." 
  He said no comment could be given on the scope and schedule 
of inspections "according to IAEA regulations."

<F P=106> [From Tokyo MAINICHI SHIMBUN 19 May Morning Edition: by </F>
correspondent Shiwahiko Machida] 
  [Text] Vienna, 18 May -- Commenting on the issue of 
replacing fuel rods at an experimental atomic reactor in 
Yongbyun, North Korea on 18 May, an official at the North Korean 
Embassy in Vienna said: "Inspectors from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will be able to take samples of 
spent fuel when the fuel rods are replaced if U.S.-North Korea 
talks are resumed." 
  It is the first time that a North Korean official has 
definitely hinted at the possibility of IAEA inspectors taking 
samples of spent fuel at the experimental atomic reactor. 
  The North Korean official told a MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter 
about the possibility on 18 May. So far, North Korea has 
refused to allow IAEA inspectors to take the samples of spent 
fuel to determine if North Korea has diverted uranium for 
military purposes. North Korea appears to have begun to soften 
its stand on the issue now that the United States has taken up 
the issue seriously. 
  Asked to comment on reports that "a substantially large 
number of fuel rods" have been replaced at the experimental 
atomic reactor, the North Korean diplomat said: "I do not know 
how many fuel rods have been replaced."

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] is 
mapping out a countermeasure after receiving a report from the 
inspection team in North Korea, which began its inspection 
activities on 18 May, confirming that North Korea has already 
begun replacing nuclear fuel rods. 
  Correspondent Cha Man-sun has this report from Vienna: 
  [Begin recording] Three inspectors conducted inspection 
activities in Yongbyon, North Korea, for the second day. Since 
yesterday, the inspection team has examined the counter and 
seals and whether the surveillance equipment installed at the 
5-mw atomic reactor has been replaced. As a result, they have 
confirmed that the replacement of nuclear fuel rods has already 
begun. 
  The inspection team, in particular, has focussed on 
examining, with the guidance of North Korean officials 
concerned, whether it is possible to take samples from the used 
nuclear fuels from the reactor in the course of the nuclear fuel 
rods being replaced. As a result, they judged that the 
replacement of nuclear fuel rods is now at an initial stage. It 
is learned that they have reported this to headquarters. 
  Well-informed sources disclose that the inspection team has 
given its initial report saying that the replaced, used nuclear 
fuels are stored in such a way as to make it difficult to find 
out from which side of the reactor they have been taken out. 
  The well-informed sources say that the persons in high-level 
policy-making authority at the IAEA are receiving, and are 
making a detailed analysis of, daily reports from the inspection 
team in North Korea on its inspection activities and the status 
of the replacement of nuclear fuel rods. They are discussing, 
the sources say, whether to seek solutions through future 
negotiations with the North. 
  These sources predict that in view of the smooth progress of 
the consecutive two-day inspection activities, a scheduled, 
additional inspection of the radiochemical laboratory will also 
go smoothly. [end recording]

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- North Korean President Kim 
Il-song says his country has been under U.S. sanctions since the 
end of the Korean War and wonders what further measures could be 
imposed on Pyongyang, the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper reported 
Thursday [19 May]. 
  Kim further told a Korean-American journalist last month 
that 
China has no means to exercise influence over Pyongyang in any 
attempt to resolve concerns that North Korea may be developing 
an atomic bomb, according to the ASAHI report. 
  For more than a year, the United States has suggested 
imposing economic sanctions on Pyongyang if North Korea does not 
permit full inspections of its nuclear facilities to ensure that 
no radioactive material is diverted to a weapons program. 
  In an April 21 interview with U.S. ASIA NEWS reporter Moon 
Myong- cha, Kim again denied that North Korea is attempting to 
build a bomb and virtually dared the U.S. to impose sanctions on 
his economically beleaguered state. 
  Since the truce (ending the 19550-1953 Korean War), we have 
been under what are actually comprehensive economic sanctions by 
the economic sphere of the U.S. side, Kim said. 
  What further sanctions beyond those we have been subjected 
to 
can be imposed? I feel like saying once, go ahead and try, Kim 
reportedly said, accusing the U.S. of trying to drive North 
Korea into a corner over the nuclear issue. 
  Kim rejected the idea that China, North Korea's lone major 
ally, can play any role in resolving the nuclear stalemate, 
saying, we are not a vassal state of China. 
  The 82-year-old North Korean leader denied that his country 
was trying to build a bomb and insisted that they have no place 
to test an atomic bomb nor a target to use it against. 
  Despite Kim's insistence on the issue, Pyongyang has 
repeatedly refused to fully comply with demands by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which monitors 
nuclear programs for the United Nations. 
  "If we show the IAEA everything they want to see, they will 
say they have doubts about other places that they want to see, 
and more places, and this attitude will continue." said Kim. 
  North Korea has rejected inspections of some facilities by 
saying they were military installations off limits to outside 
inspectors, but Kim said in the interview with Moon that 
inspections of the military sites must be carried out with 
checks of all military bases in North and South Korea. 
  Asked about North Korea's threat to turn Seoul into a "sea 
of 
flames," Kim said that Pyongyang's delegate to an inter-Korean 
meeting in March had told him the words had been uttered because 
the South Korean delegate "had gotten on his nerves." 
  Regarding the suspended talks for establishing diplomatic 
relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang, Kim said, "the door is 
always open no matter who the prime minister is."

  [Text] Washington, May 19 (YONHAP) -- International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors are continuing their activities 
at the North Korean nuclear complex in Yongbyon and nuclear fuel 
rods removed from the 5-megawatt reactor are being kept in the 
area, it was reported Thursday. 
  Press reports that North Korea was not attempting to 
separate 
the spent nuclear fuel rods and preserve them for later 
inspection have not been confirmed, sources said. 
  The information received from Yongbyon thus far is that the 
inspection team has not encountered any problems, they added. 
  The inspectors would surely have raised this issue had North 
Korea moved the fuel rods elsewhere or handled them in any other 
way, they said. 
  "It appears that the spent fuel rods removed from the 
reactor 
are being kept in the area for later preservation and checks," 
one source said. 
  Since they are only part of the roughly 8,000 rods, it is 
difficult to say what can be done about the situation, they 
said, indicating that follow-up measures by the United States 
and South Korea depend largely on the North's attitude. 
  Even though Pyongyang has removed some fuel rods from the 
reactor, the issue will not be referred to the UN Security 
Council if it cooperates with the IAEA inspectors, they added.

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) Friday [20 May] rejected a North Korean 
proposal to keep fuel rods from a controversial nuclear reactor 
in a "safe place under seal" ahead of resumed talks on the 
issue, an IAEA spokesman said. 
  "That won't work. We will no longer be able to verify with 
certainty if any of the nuclear material has been diverted," 
from the Yongbyon experimental reactor, he said. 
  The North Korean ambassador to China, Chu Chang-Jun, told a 
Beijing press conference Friday North Korea would keep "the fuel 
rods in a safe place, under seal in order that the inspectors 
can verify that nuclear material has not been diverted to 
non-peaceful ends. 
  "When the next round of discussions takes place between 
North 
Korea and the United States and a technical solution is found, 
then the agency will be able to take its samples," the 
ambassador said. 
  The IAEA said late Thursday that North Korea has begun 
extracting fuel rods from its five-megawatt Yongbyon reactor in 
a "serious violation" of IAEA inspection terms and said it would 
inform the UN Security Council. 
  The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could 
wreck the IAEA's attempts to see if fuel had already been 
diverted, the IAEA said. 
  The agency called on North Korea to allow immediate 
inspections and to delay the extraction of fuel rods until 
arrangements were in place. 
  "No North Korea response to our demands has reached us," the 
IAEA said. 
  The three agency inspectors in North Korea are attempting to 
check whether any of the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods in the reactor 
have been diverted and used to nuclear weapons. 
  The IAEA said it would still be possible to carry out 
inspections and offered to send its top officials to discuss how 
it could be done.

<F P=106> [Report by Beijing-based correspondent Yi Tong-sik] </F>
  [Text] Chu Chang-chun, North Korean ambassador to China, in 
a news conference today, said that North Korea showed the 
nuclear fuel rods being replaced at the nuclear reactor in 
Yongbyon to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection team. 
  In a news conference for foreign reporters held at the North 
Korean Embassy in Beijing this afternoon, Ambassador Chu 
stressed that although North Korea showed the IAEA inspectors 
the nuclear fuel rods, North Korea does not have the obligation 
to permit any inspection, thus hinting that an actual nuclear 
inspection was not made. 
  Ambassador Chu also said that if a package solution is 
agreed 
upon on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at the third 
round of talks between North Korea and the United States, the 
IAEA could supervise [kamsi] the replacement of the fuel rods at 
any time, thus making it clear that North Korea will link the 
nuclear inspection with its third round of talks with the United 
States.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (AFP)--North Korea was obliged to 
begin extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor for safety 
reasons and because of Washington's refusal to resume talks on 
the nuclear issue, the North Korean ambassador to China said 
Friday. 
  The United States had failed to honour pledges to provide 
North Korea with a light water reactor and to hold a third round 
of talks with Pyongyang following their last meeting in Geneva 
in July, Ambassador Chu Chang-Jun said. As a result 
"replacement of the fuel rods could not be delayed any longer 
because of safety considerations," Chu told a press conference. 
  Chu stressed that Pyongyang had, on four occasions, informed 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in advance of its 
intention to replace the rods. It was therefore unfair for the 
agency to criticise North Korea for going ahead, he said. 
  The IAEA said Thursday that its inspectors currently in 
North 
Korea had confirmed that replacement had begun in "serious 
violation" of IAEA inspection terms, and said it would report 
the action to the UN Security Council. 
  The agency called on North Korea to stop immediately any 
further withdrawal of the rods, saying that as of Thursday it 
would still be possible to implement required safety measures so 
as to verify whether any fuel has been diverted. However, Chu 
indicated that such verification would be dependent on a 
resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang. 
  "We will keep the fuel rods in a safe place and seal them 
for 
the inspectors so they can verify that nuclear materials have 
not been diverted for non-peaceful purposes," he said. 
  "When the next round of talks between North Korea and the 
United States is held and a technical solution is realised, then 
the agency can take measurements at any time." 
  Washington suspects the reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles) 
north of Pyongyang, is a nuclear bomb factory, and wants the 
IAEA to check whether North Korea has been diverting 
weapons-grade plutonium to manufacture a device. 
  In a further indication that Pyongyang had no intention of 
immediately halting the replacement procedure, Chu said the 
process "is under way and will last about two months."

  [Text] Vienna, May 20 (AFP) -- North Korea has begun 
extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor in a "serious 
violation" of International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
inspection terms that will be reported to the UN Security 
Council, the IAEA said late Thursday. 
  The removal of the rods, if not halted immediately, could 
wreck the IAEA's attempts to see if fuel had already been taken 
from the reactor, the IAEA said in a strong statement. 
  Washington wants the IAEA to check whether North Korea has 
been hiving off weapons-grade plutonium to make a nuclear bomb. 
  But the IAEA said: "As of today, it still seems possible to 
implement the required safety measures." 
  But it warned: "Should (North Korea) continue the discharge 
operation without these measures, it would result in irreparable 
loss of the Agency's ability to verify whether all nuclear 
material subject to safeguards in (North Korea) is in fact under 
safeguards and that no such material has been diverted." 
  The IAEA said it had sent a telex to North Korea on Thursday 
to complain that the discharge of fuel rods "constitutes a 
serious violation of the safeguards agreement" for monitoring 
nuclear facilities. 
  The statement said IAEA inspectors on site had "confirmed 
that core discharge has indeed started." 
  "The Agency has concluded that further discharge of fuel 
rods 
would jeopardise the possibility of the Agency applying 
safeguards measures necessry to verify whether any fuel has been 
diverted in the past." 
  The statement said the IAEA would report the violation to 
the 
United Nations Security Council. 
  "The Agency has asked (North Korea) to make arrangements 
promptly for the requisite safeguards measures and has urged 
that until these are in place, further discharge be deferred." 
  It said it wanted to send an IAEA team to the site 
immediately to discuss implementing the checks. 
  In Washington, President Bill Clinton said this week: "I 
think it would be an error for North Korea to continue to thwart 
these inspections after they have agreed to comply with them." 
  U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, said Wednesday that 
the United States faced "a very substantial near-term crisis" 
with North Korea. 
  The fuel rods in the reactor contains enough plutonium for 
four or five nuclear bombs, the Pentagon said. 
  North Korea has denied that it has a nuclear weapons program 
but has balked at international inspections. 
  The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North 
Korea withdrew enough plutonium in the late 1980s to make at 
least one nuclear device and that there is a more than 50 
percent chance it actually did so. 
  North Korea's continued refusal to abide by the IAEA's non- 
proliferation rules has led to international threats of UN 
sanctions, which in turn prompted war threats from Pyongyang. 
  North Korean President Kim Il-Sung, in his latest warning, 
said that North Korea would not bow to international pressure 
over its nuclear ambitions, saying that "pressure can never be a 
solution to the problem," according to the Korean Central News 
Agency (KCNA). 
  "If the United States continues to clamour to put pressure 
on 
our republic, we will be compelled to take due measures of 
self-defence to safeguard the dignity of our nation and the 
sovereignty of our country," added the leader of the Stalinist 
state.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 21 May commentary: "No One Can Challenge Our </F>
Work To Replace the Fuel Rods"] 
  [Text] Recently, the United States and its following forces 
are once again strengthening the antirepublic oppressive 
commotion by finding fault with the issue of replacing the fuel 
rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant 
[sihom wonjaryok paljonso]. 
  They are trying to drive the situation to an extreme 
circumstance [kuktanui sanghwang] by saying that the nuclear 
issue has entered a grave stage, that the replacement of our 
fuel rods is a grave violation of the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT] and the safeguards accord, that our issue must be 
brought to the UN Security Council and sanctions implemented, 
and so on because we started to replace the fuel rods. This is 
a violent distortion of the facts, and tells us that the United 
States and its following forces are persistently maneuvering to 
crush [apsal] our Republic. 
  The issue of replacing the fuel rods at our five-megawatt 
experimental nuclear power plant, is a natural consequence 
resulting from the rupture of the DPRK-U.S. talks by the United 
States. 
  In reality, up until now the United States had used the 
DPRK-U.S. talks as a lever to realize its selfish goal by 
strengthening its pressure on us. The United States created a 
nuclear crisis and increased pressure on us inside and outside 
the talks. Also, under the cloak of modernizing the U.S. forces 
stationed in South Korea, it shoved in numerous military 
equipment into South Korea, including the Patriot missiles and 
Apache helicopters, for offensive use and obtained enormous 
economic interests, and strengthened its military presence in 
South Korea, which is a strategic point of Asia. On the other 
hand, we are receiving a grave military threat from the United 
States. 
  The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks was disrupted. The 
DPRK-U.S. agreement on changing the graphite-moderated reactor 
system to light-water moderated reactor system have a long way 
to go due to the betrayal act of the United States. Under this 
circumstance, we could no longer indefinitely freeze the 
operation of the graphite-moderated reactor system even by 
suffering an enormous economic loss. Therefore, it was 
inevitable for us to move toward the road of normalizing our 
peaceful nuclear activities. 
  No one can pick a quarrel with the issue of replacing the 
fuel rods at our five-megawatt experimental nuclear power plant, 
even from the technology safety point of view. 
  The fuel rods in the five-megawatt experimental nuclear 
power 
plant were (?placed) in 1986. Since, we have delayed the 
replacement of the fuel rods until now to provide a favorable 
environment for the DPRK-U.S. talks. Today, a considerable 
number of fuel rods have been damaged. In particular, due to 
the damage of the ventilator, a situation was created in which 
we had to stop the operation of the experimental atomic reactor 
[sihom wonjaro]. 
  As a result, a serious safety issue was put forth in the 
operation of the experimental atomic reactor, and thus it became 
inevitable to take out the fuel rods immediately. 
  Out of such urgency, we sent as many as five telex messages 
to the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] regarding the 
replacement of fuel rods. In the telex messages, we called on 
the IAEA to take necessary measures regarding this--such as 
being present at the scene to seal and dismantle [haechae] 
them--while informing in advance our plan on replacing the fuel 
rods. 
  In addition, we explicitly clarified that in the event the 
IAEA Secretariat did not take appropriate measures at the right 
time, we would be compelled to recognize this as an action that 
the IAEA has empowered us with the authority to break the seals 
at appropriate (?spots) [kuromyonso kigusogigugi haedanghan 
taechaegul chaettae chwihaji annungyongu haedang (?kaesoaeso) 
ponginul ttel kwonhanul uriege puyohangosuro injonghalsubakke 
optanungosul myongbaekhihayotta]. What is more, we agreed to 
all the IAEA's demands on the witnessing activities, except 
selective measurement of fuel rods because it is against our 
unique stance, and immediately issued visas upon request. 
However, the IAEA Secretariat unreasonably came out with 
demands tantamount to irregular inspections [pijonggi sacharae 
manmongnun yogurul murihagae tulgonawatsumyo] by babbling about 
selective preservation of fuel rods and, thus, rejected the 
witnessing, openly ignoring our unique status following the 
temporary suspension of the effectuation of the withdrawal from 
the NPT. 
  Under such circumstance, we, as means of last concession, 
sent an emergency letter to the U.S. side writing that if our 
unique stance was settled [haesodoemyon] now by bringing the 
package deal between the DPRK and the United States to a 
success, we could allow all regular and irregular 
[chonggimitpijonggi] inspections -- including selective 
preservation of some fuel -- even during the course of replacing 
the fuel rods. Nonetheless, the United States also rejected 
this proposal and did not respond to the talks with the DPRK. 
  Under such conditions, we could no longer delay the changing 
of fuel rods due to technical safety reasons [kisul anjongsang 
iyuro]. In view of this, the beginning of our work on replacing 
fuel rods without the presence of the IAEA Secretariat's 
inspectors was an unavoidable step entirely stemmed from the 
IAEA's unreasonable acts. Such being the case, there is no 
grounds for the United States and the IAEA Secretariat to say so 
and so about our replacement of fuel rods. 
  Before picking on us, the IAEA Secretariat should reflect on 
its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the normal 
nuclear activities of a member nation. It is an unbreakable 
mission of the IAEA to go to the spot for confirmation and to 
take necessary measures when an abnormal situation crops up in a 
member nation. 
  Although we requested the agency to immediately take 
appropriate measures, including a quick removal of the seals 
under unavoidable circumstances, the IAEA Secretariat avoided to 
be present in the replacement of the fuel rods for the reason 
that we refused to meet their unilateral demand of being allowed 
to choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is 
now raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the 
agency's Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that we 
unsealed the facilities and violated the NPT. This is obviously 
a mean, conscienceless act unbecoming to an international 
organization. 
  The U.S. action is also the same. If the United States had 
responded to the DPRK-U.S. talks and brought a package deal to a 
success as demanded by us, such complicated problems existing 
now would have not even been raised from the beginning. 
  Nevertheless, the United States avoided the third round of 
the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring problems put forth by us and 
continuously persisting in unreasonable preconditions. 
Therefore, for the United States to make an issue of the 
replacement of our fuel rods now is the same as a thief turning 
on the master with a club. 
  In particular, some officials in the United States are 
currently stirring up the public opinion as if we were replacing 
the fuel rods to extract plutonium to produce four to five 
nuclear bombs. This is truly preposterous. 
  Unavoidably, we started the replacement of the fuel rods 
without the presence of the IAEA, but we are working our best to 
verify that the nuclear materials are not being diverted for 
other non-peaceful purposes in the process of replacing the fuel 
rods because of the consistent will to prove the innocence of 
the peaceful nuclear activities. 
  The IAEA can never be allowed to choose and keep the fuel 
rods before our special status is brought to an end. However, 
this does not mean that the continuity of the safeguards would 
be broken. The work of replacing our fuel rods is now going on 
under the strict observation of the inspection cameras installed 
by the IAEA and as soon as the fuel rods are taken out, they are 
kept under the restriction and surveillance of the IAEA. 
  We are carrying out the work on replacing fuel rods in such 
a 
manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of measuring all 
the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is resolved in a 
package deal and the partiality of the agency removed [urinun 
appro haengmunjeui ilgwaltagyoli silhyondoego kiguui 
pulgongjongsongi haesodoenun sichomegaso kyochedoen 
modunyollyobongduladaehan chukchong kanungsongul chungbunuhui 
pojonhanun panghyangeso nosimyollyojagobul chinhaenghagoitta]. 
This matter can be solved through negotiations between the DPRK 
and the IAEA. 
  Nonetheless, some forces inside the United States are trying 
to forcibly [okchiro] link our fuel rod replacement work with 
nuclear development. This can only be seen as a childish plot 
[yuchihan sulchaek] designed to find a justification to impose 
sanctions on us by deliberately aggravating the situation. At 
present, the attempt to justify its unreasonable argument with 
any wild guess or assumption can never get through. The nuclear 
issue should also seek a fair solution on the basis of the 
reality, squarely seeing the reality. 
  The United States and the IAEA Secretariat must no longer 
make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving the 
issue.

<F P=106> ["Nobody Is Allowed To Slander DPRK's Replacement of Fuel </F>
Rods " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
carries a commentary denouncing the United States and the forces 
following it for rendering the situation extremely strained, 
threatening "sanctions" as regards the replacement of fuel rods 
at the five megawatt experimental nuclear power station of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The author of the commentary says: The refueling is an 
inevitable consequence of the breakup of the DPRK-U.S. talks by 
the United States and nobody can decry it in view of technical 
safety. 
  Our starting of the replacement of fuel rods in the absence 
of inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] 
is entirely an inevitable result of the unreasonable acts of the 
United States and the IAEA Secretariat. 
  Declaring that the United States and the Secretariat of the 
agency have no justification to decry our refueling, the analyst 
further says: 
  The Secretariat of the agency, before slandering us, must 
reflect on its acts in avoiding its obligation to guarantee the 
normal nuclear activities of the member nation. It is an 
unavoidable duty of the agency to come to the spot, verify 
things and take necessary measures when an abnormal situation is 
created in the nuclear activities of a member nation. 
  Though we requested the agency to immediately take 
appropriate measures including a quick removal of the seal under 
unavoidable circumstances, the Secretariat of the agency avoided 
presence in the replacement of fuel rods for the reason that we 
refused to meet their unilateral demand for being allowed to 
choose and keep some of the replaced fuel rods. And it is now 
raising quite a row, informing the member nations of the Board 
of Governors of the agency and the United Nations Security 
Council that we unsealed the facilities and violated the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. This is obviously a mean, 
conscienceless act unbecoming to an international organization. 
  The U.S. act is none the better. If the United States had 
responded to the talks with the DPRK and brought a package deal 
to a success as demanded by the DPRK, such complicated problems 
would have not been raised. But the United States avoided the 
third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, ignoring our proposals and 
persisting in unreasonable preconditions. And now it is making 
a case of our replacement of fuel rods. This reminds us of a 
thief turning on the master with a club. 
  Some quarters of the United States are now spreading the 
rumor that we are replacing fuel rods to extract plutonium 
enough for the manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs. It is 
ridiculous, indeed. 
  Though we have started the replacement of fuel rods without 
the presence of the agency under unavoidable circumstances, this 
work is now going on under the strict observation of the 
inspection cameras installed by the agency and as soon as fuel 
rods are taken out, they are kept under the containment and 
surveillance devices of the agency. We are replacing fuel rods 
in such a manner as to fully preserve the possibilities of 
measuring all the replaced fuel rods when the nuclear issue is 
resolved in a package deal and the partiality of the agency 
removed. This matter can be solved through negotiations between 
the DPRK and the IAEA. 
  Nevertheless, some forces of the United States are now 
linking the refueling in a far-fetched way with "nuclear arms 
development." This is a despicable trick to find a pretext for 
"sanctions" against the DPRK by intentionally rendering the 
situation strained. 
  An attempt to justify one's unreasonable logic with 
speculation and supposition does not work now. The nuclear 
issue, too, requires a fair solution based on a proper judgement 
of the reality. 
  The United States and the Secretariat of the agency must no 
longer make mistakes in the solution to the nuclear issue on the 
Korean peninsula but take a proper position for honestly solving 
the issue.

  [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister Yi 
Hong-ku said on Monday the exchange of fuel rods at a 
five-megawatt atomic reactor at Yongbyon, North Korea is 
believed to have been 10 to 15 percent complete so far. Yi's 
remarks mean that of the total 8,100 fuel rods at the reactor, 
about 1,000 have been replaced. 
  Speaking at a National Assembly Foreign Affairs and 
Unification Committee meeting, Yi said the initial report from 
an IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspection team 
indicated that there is no significant problem with respect to 
the storage and future gauging of selected fuel bars from the 
reactor. "The IAEA will have full-fledged negotiations with 
North Korea over this matter beginning Tuesday," Yi said. 
  Earlier in the day at a breakfast meeting hosted by the 
Korean Newspaper Editors Association, Yi said his recent remarks 
that "the South-North denuclearization declaration will be made 
void and null if North Korea were found to have even a half 
nuclear weapon" was the expression of his view directed 
indirectly toward the United States. 
  Yi made the remarks when asked by Democratic Party Rep. 
Namkung Chin what was his view of a recent statement of U.S. 
Secretary of Defense William Perry, in which Perry spoke as if 
his country would connive at one or two nuclear weapons in the 
possession of North Korea.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] team 
for negotiations with North Korea that arrived in Pyongyang this 
afternoon will work for the replacement of nuclear fuel rods, 
along with the three inspectors who have checked the replacement 
of nuclear fuel rods in North Korea for the past week. 
  IAEA spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA negotiating 
team 
arrived in Pyongyang this afternoon and will begin full-pledged 
negotiations with North Korean officials tomorrow. 
  In particular, it is expected that, in the forthcoming 
negotiations with North Korea, the IAEA will demand [chokku] a 
random choice [imui sontaek] of replaced nuclear fuel rods and 
separate preservation [pyolto pogwan] of them in special 
containers, and North Korea will repeatedly insist on its 
previous position that it will allow this after the nuclear 
issue is resolved in a package deal through negotiations with 
the United States.

  [Text] New York, May 24 KYODO -- Japan and South Korea on 
Tuesday [24 May] agreed with U.S. plans to go ahead with a third 
round of high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva in early 
June. 
  The United States is seeking to encourage North Korea to be 
more transparent with its nuclear activities, including allowing 
full inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci discussed 
the North Korean nuclear question with South Korea's special 
envoy for nuclear issues Kim Sam-hun on Monday and the two met 
Tuesday with Yukio Takeuchi, deputy director general of the 
Japanese Foreign Ministry's Asian Affairs Bureau. 
  Washington has approved of North Korea's readiness to go 
along with IAEA inspections of its nuclear facilities and 
decided to resume high-level talks with Pyongyang, suspended 
last July, in an effort to reach a political resolution to the 
stalemate. 
  In Washington, U.S. Government sources said an announcement 
on the scheduling of the talks will be made in the near future. 
  Tuesday's meeting in New York reportedly went smoothly as 
the 
three parties agreed on their position in dealing with North 
Korea in the future, the sources said. 
  The sources stressed that the high-level talks could be 
forfeited and the issue referred to the U.N. Security Council if 
North Korea continues with the refueling of its experimental 
nuclear reactor in the Yongbyon complex north of Pyongyang 
without an agreement with the IAEA on inspecting the spent fuel 
rods.

  [Text] Vienna, May 25 (AFP) -- Inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have completed their 
inspection of a controversial experimental laboratory in North 
Korea and took samples from spent fuel rods, IAEA officials said 
in Vienna Wednesday. 
  The samples should allow the IAEA to determine how long the 
fuel rods were in the reactor and thereby calculate whether 
plutonium could have been diverted, possibly for use in making 
nuclear bombs.

  [Text] Beijing, May 26 (YONHAP) -- A high-level Chinese 
Foreign Ministry official visited Pyongyang last week and 
advised North Korea to compromise and negotiate a peaceful 
solution to the nuclear problem, a South Korean Embassy source 
here said Wednesday. 
  "A high-level official in charge of Asian Affairs at the 
Chinese Foreign Ministry came back after visiting North Korea 
last week," the source said, suggesting that Beijing is involved 
in last-minute efforts to persuade Pyongyang. 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan told visiting 
South Korean Lawmaker Mun Chong-su, secretary-general of the 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), Wednesday that his 
country is urging North Korea to settle the nuclear row through 
dialogue and that Pyongyang responded positively. 
  Tang said this information had been delivered to South Korea 
and the United States, according to DLP Spokesman Son Hak-kyu. 
  The Chinese Government welcomes South Korea's flexibility in 
trying to resolve the nuclear dispute, such as withdrawing its 
demand for an inter-Korean envoy exchange, Tang was quoted as 
saying. 
  On the delayed conclusion of a South Korean-Chinese aviation 
agreement, Tang said the two countries had agreed on overall 
principles and commercial airline companies must now determine 
the business terms of the pact. 
  He said he hopes to see the agreement signed soon. 
  The vice foreign minister said the two countries will sign 
an 
agreement on forming a South Korea-China Industrial Committee 
sometime this month. South Korean Ambassador to Beijing Hwang 
Pyong-tae will sign the accord along with Wang Zhongyu, minister 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission. 
  The committee, agreed when South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam visited Beijing in March, is expected to convene its 
first meeting in Seoul.

  [Text] Berlin, May 25 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency [IAEA] denied reports Wednesday that IAEA 
inspectors had taken samples from North Korea's controversial 
five-megawatt reactor at Yongbyon. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said the inspectors had completed 
checking a key radiochemical laboratory, but failed to take 
samples from spent fuel rods at the five-megawatt reactor. 
  He said the UN experts had finished additional inspections 
of 
the laboratory last weekend, completing the task of collecting 
samples from the lab that was begun in March. 
  Meanwhile, an IAEA negotiating team began talks with North 
Korean officials to discuss technical issues related to 
witnessing the fuel rod replacement. 
  The negotiations are to resume Thursday, but it is uncertain 
when and how they will end, Meyer added. 
  The two-man negotiating team headed by Demitri Perricos, 
IAEA 
safeguards department director, that arrived in Pyongyang 
Tuesday met with the North Koreans Wednesday, meyer said. 
  Of the three inspectors who came to North Korea last 
weekend, 
two were taking part in the negotiations while the third left 
the country for Vienna to report the inspection results to the 
IAEA.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>
  [Text] Hiroshima May 26 TASS -- "Even the most thorough 
international inspection of North Korean atomic facilities, 
carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), 
will [not] be able to decide for sure whether North Korea is 
developing nuclear weapons or not," a Russian armaments expert, 
who wanted to remain anonymous, told ITAR-TASS. The expert is 
now attending the U.N. disarmament conference in Hiroshima. 
  He explained his point of view by the specifics of the 
nuclear technology used by North Korea. Even if IAEA inspectors 
get access to the nuclear wastes and to the rods of the reactors 
supposedly used for the development of atomic weapons, even if 
they get a chance to analyse these materials, they will not be 
able to decide for sure whether Pyongyang is developing a 
nuclear bomb or not," the expert stated. In his opinion, this 
explains North Korea's stand on the inspection of its nuclear 
facilities. "If North Korea allows the IAEA to carry out a 
thorough inspection," he said, "this will only increase 
suspicions that Pyongyang is hiding something from the 
international community, because IAEA experts will not be able 
to arrive at any definite conclusion." 
  The Russian expert believes that suspicions about North 
Korea's efforts to develop nuclear weapons could be fully 
dispelled or, on the contrary, confirmed only if a 
representative international team of experts would carry out a 
lasting and broad examination of North Korean nuclear 
facilities, tantamount to permanent control over them, which 
should continue for several months. "The several days, during 
which a IAEA inspection will last, cannot resolve the problem of 
North Korea's nuclear programme," he noted. 
  Stressing that this was merely his personal opinion, the 
expert said that he doubted very much the existence of nuclear 
weapons in North Korea today. "This is why it is necessary to 
continue the efforts to solve this problem through a dialogue 
with Pyongyang, and not by means of punitive sanctions against 
the Korean People's Democratic Republic," he stated.

  [Text] Vienna, May 26 (AFP) -- Talks between nuclear 
inspectors and North Korea on the monitoring of fuel rods and 
regular inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear reactor resumed here 
Thursday, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agnecy 
(IAEA) said. 
  He said the talks, which began Wednesday, were expected to 
continue through Friday. 
  The North Korean Government has so far refused to allow IAEA 
inspectors to monitor the refueling of its five-megawatt reactor 
at Yongbyon, the country's only nuclear power plant located 90 
kilometres (55 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang. 
  IAEA inspectors on Wednesday completed maintenance work on 
surveillance equipment installed at the plant and were allowed 
to take samples from a nuclear reprocessing plant, also at 
Yongbyon. 
  The samples should allow the agency to determine whether 
plutonium could have been manufactured or diverted, possibly for 
use in making nuclear bombs. 
  The inspectors, however, arrived after North Korea had begun 
refueling its Yongbyong reactor and some of the 8,000 fuel rods 
had already been removed. 
  The IAEA charged that by starting the refueling before the 
arrival of the inspectors, North Korea was in violation of IAEA 
inspection terms and that the agency would inform the UN 
Security Council for possible punitive sanctions. 
  The agency added, however, that it was still possible to 
take 
samples from the spent fuel rods to determine whether plutonium 
was diverted for military purposes.

<F P=106> [By Yi Tong-min] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean nuclear 
dispute became a life-or-death situation Saturday with Seoul 
officials conceding the virtual failure of 
Pyongyang-International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) negotiations. 
  IAEA Director-general Hans Blix reported to the U.N. 
Security 
Council that North Korea could finish unloading nuclear fuel 
rods within days and thus destroy the chances of measuring what 
went on at the five-megawatt reactor during the past eight years 
of operation. 
  The IAEA, the United States and South Korea have made clear 
that if such measurement was not guaranteed, they would seek 
countermeasures through the U.N. Security Council. The Security 
Council already held informal consultation Friday evening and 
will meet again early next week to discuss the situation based 
on Blix's report. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu chaired a hastily called 
meeting of vice and assistant ministers and his nuclear 
negotiating team to discuss the latest report from Vienna. 
Officials said the IAEA is likely to issue a final statement 
sometime in the morning from Vienna. If the agency judges that 
the chances of future measurement are ruined, it is certain to 
request action by the Security Council. 
  The officials were clinging to the little hope that 
remained, 
saying two of the five IAEA inspectors currently in Pyongyang 
will stay behind and monitor the progress in the discharge of 
fuel rods from North Korea's five-megawatt reactor. 
  These inspectors could restart negotiations with North Korea 
on halting the unloading process so that the IAEA can select and 
store the critical rods for future measurement. Measurement is 
considered a must in determining how much plutonium North Korea 
has stockpiled. "But it's definitely closer to a failure," said 
one ministry official on condition of anonymity. "As to whether 
the remaining inspectors can succeed in negotiations, we can't 
be sure." 
  North Korea began discharging the 800 bundles of fuel rods, 
each bundle containing 10 rods, from May 12. according to Blix, 
Pyongyang has done 50 percent of the unloading and will be able 
to complete the job within days. 
  Washington, in working-level contacts with Pyongyang over 
the 
past few days, has insisted that North Korea at least stop the 
discharge. This would ensure that there was still a chance of 
taking the necessary measurements. But North Korea has refused 
to halt the work, demanding instead that the United States sit 
down for the next round of high-level negotiations to discuss 
how measurement can be guaranteed, apparently a tactic to 
continue using the five- megawatt reactor as a bargaining chip. 
  "North Korea never said it would not allow measurement. But 
it's becoming obvious that Pyongyang is doing its best to keep 
its past nuclear activities a secret, away from any analysis or 
probe," said one analyst at the Foreign Ministry. 
  In truth, full access to the fuel rods and their measurement 
would disclose the majority of North Korea's nuclear development 
program, and giving it away would dramatically weaken 
Pyongyang's nuclear card. 
  Foreign Minister Han had repeated that guaranteeing 
measurement is "the line" that decides whether diplomatic 
efforts continue or end. North Korea is close to crossing that 
line and officials say that by next week, new circumstances may 
arise that demand a confrontation with Pyongyang.

  [Text] Brasilia, 4 Jun -- Russia is to sell Brazil air 
defense missiles and launchers. Agreement on this was reached 
here during talks which ended on Friday between the leadership 
of the Ministry of the Army of this major Latin American country 
and representatives of the Rosvooruzheniye [Russian armaments] 
association. 
  In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent, Col 
(?Cupertino), a spokesman of the Army Ministry, stated Russia 
will sell Brazil 112 Igla missiles used against helicopters and 
other low-flying targets and 56 missile launchers. To purchase 
this combat equipment Brazil's military chiefs have used part of 
the 100 million dollars allocated by the government for the 
modernization of the army. An ITAR-TASS correspondent received 
confirmation from a spokesman of the Russian Embassy in Brasilia 
that the deal had been concluded. 
  Col. Cupertino stressed the deal was concluded as a result 
of 
the talks that were held in Moscow last September by Zenildo de 
Lucena, minister of the army, and the inter-governmental 
protocol of intent on trade and economic cooperation that was 
signed last December during the visit to Russia by Jose Andrade 
Vieira, then minister of industry, commerce and tourism. The 
protocol envisages, among other things, increasing the volume of 
Russian-Brazilian trade to four billion dollars in the next four 
years. The ministry spokesman said it was possible that other 
agreements in the military sphere would be reached in future and 
Brazil was interested in pursuing this. In connection with 
this, Gen. Gilberto Serra, head of the center for social 
relations of the Ministry of the Army, in an interview for the 
GLOBO newspaper said "Brazil is interested in buying from Russia 
as large a volume of armaments as possible at the least cost." 
At the present time Brazil is studying the possibility of 
organizing production of Igla type missiles in the country, he 
stressed.

missing from a Japanese factory processing nuclear fuel. 
  Some 70 kilograms (154 pounds) of plutonium, enough to make 
nine nuclear bombs, had in fact accumulated as "hold-up" in dust 
form on exposed surfaces of processing areas, the IAEA said in a 
statement. 
  "The IAEA has been well aware of the presence of this 
material throughout, which has been fully declared as hold-up by 
the operator and is measured by the IAEA on a monthly basis, 
using a specially-designed system," the statement said. 
  In other respects, the Tokai-mura plant northeast of Tokyo 
was a highly-automated facility with the most advanced nuclear 
material accountancy system in existence, providing information 
to the IAEA on the movement and quantities of such material on a 
near real-time basis, the nuclear watchdog said. 
  The plant operators had decided to leave the deposited 
hold-up where it was since the plant opened in October 1988 to 
minimise radiation exposure to personnel, the IAEA said. 
  However with a view to improving the quality of the 
measurements the IAEA had urged the necessity of collecting the 
hold-up material and a schedule for this was currently being 
worked out with the Japanese authorities, the statement added. 
  The Washington-based Nuclear Control Institute, a 
non-governmental organisation, said on May 9 that the plant 
should be closed until the problem is solved. 
  NCI president Paul Leventhal said there was no proof that 
Japan was diverting plutonium for a weapons program. But he 
asked the IAEA to closely monitor the Japanese facility. 
  A plant spokesman rebutted the demand for the shutdown on 
May 
11, saying, "There is nothing unclear about what are strictly 
residuals in the production process. We have made efforts to 
reduce them and we will." 
  Leventhal said the NCI had sent a letter to U.S. Secretary 
of 
State Warren Christopher urging him to take the matter up with 
Japan as most of the plutonium being used at the plant came from 
the United States. 
  According to press reports, the IAEA was concerned because 
the instrument monitoring the amount of plutonium in the 
production process had a margin of error between 10 and 15 
percent. 
  It means that for every 70 kilograms of plutonium counted, 
some eight kilograms, enough for a nuclear bomb, could have 
escaped detection.

<F P=106> [Article signed LVE/GGD: "EU-Ukraine Partnership Agreement: </F>
Probable Signing at Corfu Summit"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 16 May (BELGA) -- The European Union (EU) 
and Ukraine should be signing a partnership agreement in June, 
probably at the European summit on the Greek island of Corfu, 
and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk could be invited to 
attend this twice yearly meeting of European heads of state and 
government for this purpose, Belgian Foreign Minister Willy 
Claes indicated on Monday. 
  The agreement, as signed by the two parties in Brussels in 
March, has been held over pending ratification by the Ukrainian 
Parliament of the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty]. 
  At a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the Belgian foreign 
minister recommended that the EU should adopt an uncompromising 
position, believing that this would help strengthen Mr. 
Kravchuk's authority. But most of his colleagues favored an 
immediate signing, thereby forcing Ukraine to sign the NPT 
before ratification of the partnership agreement by the European 
Parliament and the national assemblies of the Twelve. 
  The ministers also confirmed their commitment to EU 
financial 
aid for Ukraine, notably by funding the purchase by the Kiev 
authorities of seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides in order to 
relaunch a farming sector which has fallen into decay due to 
lack of funds. 
  The ministers also discussed at length the question of civil 
nuclear power. They were unanimous in calling for the shutdown 
of reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, seriously 
damaged following an accident in April 1986. 
  (On Monday afternoon, the Kiev authorities requested 
financial aid in order to allow them to permanently shut down 
Chernobyl and ensure energy supplies for Ukraine.) 
  In return, the Twelve expressed a willingness to contribute 
to financial aid granted in the framework of the G7 (a grouping 
of the world's seven most industrialized nations) in order to 
complete the construction of two new nuclear power stations. 
Mr. Claes stated that these new reactors are already between 90 
and 70 percent finished. 
  The Belgian minister did, however, express some reservations 
regarding the future of the civil nuclear program in Ukraine. 
"I do not believe it is wise to envisage the continued 
production of nuclear energy in Ukraine. There are other 
alternative solutions, such as the sale of electricity at very 
low prices while waiting for traditional power stations to be 
built," he told the assembled press.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Shanghai Becomes China's Major </F>
Nuclear Power Equipment Manufacturing Base"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 17 May (LIEN HO PAO)--The Shanghai power 
plant manufacturing industry, which provided the nuclear power 
equipment for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant and the Daya Bay 
Nuclear Power Plant, recently signed a technical agreement to 
build two 600,000-kilowatt nuclear power plants for the Phase-2 
Qinshan project. It has also signed contracts to export a 
300,000-kilowatt nuclear power plant to Pakistan. Shanghai is 
becoming China's major nuclear power equipment manufacturing 
base. 
  In developing its nuclear power industry, Shanghai has 
invested nearly 200 million yuan and has built a number of 
fairly large nuclear power infrastructure projects. It has 
built factory buildings with a total floor space of 93,000 
square meters, including seven 100-400-tonne-class factory 
buildings. Since 1988, Shanghai has allocated over 3 million 
yuan in financial credits for tackling scientific and 
technological projects in nuclear power development. By the end 
of last year, it had defined 88 projects, of which 62 had passed 
appraisal tests. Meanwhile, the relevant ministries, 
commissions, and offices of the State Council have assigned to 
Shanghai 11 problems for the development of a 600,000-kilowatt 
nuclear power plant -- a key project to be tackled in the 
state's Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995). They have also 
allocated over 12 million yuan to improve Shanghai's ability to 
manufacture nuclear power equipment. 
  Shanghai has earmarked another 200 million-odd yuan in the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan for gradually developing Shanghai's 
production capability so that it can turn out between one and 
one and a half sets of nuclear power plant equipment annually 
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).

  [Text] Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] has 
developed an armored vehicle that it believes is as good as any 
tank being used by NATO or East Bloc forces. The total cost of 
development, 126 million rands. Marinus Wijnbeek reports that 
the tank demonstrates the technological capabilities of the 
South African arms industry. [begin recording] 
  Wijnbeek: The tank technology demonstrator, as it 
is called, bears little relation to the existing Olifant tanks 
used by the armed forces. An important feature of the tank is 
its suitability for the unique and harsh African conditions. A 
number of South African firsts are incorporated in its design. 
This is the first tank that has an adapted commercial engine and 
cooling systems which ensure crew comfort under the hot African 
sun. The gun sight is stabilized for all-round functioning and 
has a thermal night sight. Only the latest American Abrahms has 
a comparable sight. The tank commander has state of the art 
passive night vision. The gun on the demonstrator has a 105 mm 
caliber, but this will soon be upgraded to a South African 
developed 120 mm, and later a 140 mm barrel. The 
maneuverability of the tank and its cross country and road 
speeds are 35 and 71 km/h which aren't at all bad for a 58.3 ton 
armored vehicle. It also has extensive crew safety systems in 
case it is hit by an enemy. This includes top protection. 
  Andre Buys Armscor spokesman: This tank technology 
demonstrator will be used as a test-bed to evaluate new 
technology and to retain our armor system capability. It will 
also be used to market our upgrading capability. There is an 
attractive global market for the modernization of older 
generation armored vehicles. 
  Wijnbeek: Impressive though it is, Armscor's 
latest fighting vehicle will probably not go into production. 
Although the tank's technology may find its way around the 
world, this demonstrator is likely to remain just that. [end

  [Text] Johannesburg May 30 SAPA -- A draft document 
approved by the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as the 
basis for a national policy for the defence industry was 
released in Johannesburg on Monday. The draft policy was 
produced by the TEC's sub-council on defence and approved by the 
TEC in April as the basis for the government's defence industry 
policy. 
  The document says that because the defence industry is one 
of 
the country's major assets "it would not be in the national 
interest to totally discard it". However, the new defence 
industry policy should be seen within broader political and 
moral considerations as part of the general industrial policy 
for manufacturing in South Africa. The draft document calls for 
retention of some of the defence industry's capabilities for 
military and security application, but also proposes 
diversification and conversion to meet civilian market needs. A 
diversification council has been recommended to encourage this. 
  According to the proposals, no new industry establishment, 
through state funding, should be undertaken where capabilities 
already exist in the public or private sector. 
  Central to the new defence policy is the retention of 
research and development spending at the current level of 
R[rand]420 million a year. Unless the expenditure is maintained 
the industry will lose its technological edge and much of its 
design and development capabilities, the working document 
states. A joint management system has been recommended for 
technology development and to co-ordinate long-term planning of 
all military research and development. The draft proposals say 
the state should encourage industry to invest in defence 
research and development. 
  Turning to an arms trade policy, the proposal includes the 
development by the Defence Ministry and the approval by a 
parliamentary defence sub-committee of guidelines regarding 
customers of conventional armaments. A list of recipient 
countries should be approved by a cabinet committee. Armaments 
should be sold only to recognised governments and not to 
guerrilla or other movements, the document proposes. 
  It also says South Africa should refrain from trading in 
weapons of mass destruction, while the present system of arms 
trade control should be rationalised. The Defence Ministry 
should control all arms exports and imports and related 
technology transfers on behalf of the government. Wherever 
possible, South Africa should reveal the type of products it 
sells and who its clients are by contributing to the United 
Nations conventional arms registers --provided trading partners 
approve of such disclosures. 
  According to the proposals, South Africa should no longer 
strive for complete self-sufficiency in arms, as this is neither 
affordable nor necessary. In certain areas the policy should be 
to purchase overseas, in others to procure on a competitive 
basis, while in strategic areas limited self-sufficiency should 
be maintained. 
  Turning to the acquisition of defence systems, equipment and 
services, the working group recommended the Defence Ministry 
should be responsible for planning and budgeting for the SA 
[South African] National Defence Force. Certain regulatory and 
policy-making functions currently performed by Armscor should 
also be handled by the ministry. 
  The draft also proposes greater transparency and 
accountability to parliament, the public and to the 
auditor-general. 
  Speaking at a news briefing in a Johannesburg hotel, Dr 
Andre 
Buys, the convenor of the TEC working group that produced the 
proposals, stressed the document was merely a draft. It was 
being submitted to an open, public debate where it should be 
considered in terms of South Africa's security, socio-economic 
and industrial policy requirements. This was a move away from 
past policy-making behind closed doors, he said. "We are 
inviting criticism and debate in the spirit of democracy," Dr 
Buys said.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 16 May (EFE) -- After approving a 
number of recent amendments, the Brazilian Senate today ratified 
the Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry stated that with the 
ratification of the treaty and its amendments Brazil has 
completed a revision of its international nuclear policy, thus 
demonstrating its commitment to the nonproliferation of nuclear 
weapons. 
  The Tlatelolco Treaty, which was signed in Mexico City on 14 
February 1967, was designed to make Latin America the first 
region in the world to be free of nuclear weapons and to stop 
the arms race in the region. 
  The Brazilian Foreign Ministry added that the treaty's 
ratification "clearly demonstrates the high significance the 
country attaches to the treaty, which provides that all 
signatories are equals and have the same rights and obligations 
and requires safeguards from militarily armed countries."

<F P=106> ["Newsletter From China: "Atomic and Hydrogen Bomb </F>
Experiment Base in Qinghai To Be Demilitarized and Used as the 
Site for a Development Zone"] 
  [Text] China's first nuclear weapons research and 
development base is located along side the Qinghai Lake in 
Haiyan County of Qinghai Province. As China's first atomic bomb 
and first hydrogen bomb were successfully developed there, 
people call it the "two-bomb base." 
  On entering the "two-bomb base," what one sees first is a 
monument. The inscription, "China's First Nuclear Weapons 
Research and Development Base," was written by General Zhang 
Aiping. 
  The "two-bomb base" was built in 1958, and its formal name 
was the State-Owned 221 Plant. In those days, a number of 
nuclear specialists, under the direction of by Marshal Nie 
Rongzhen, gathered here to research and develop atomic and 
hydrogen bombs. During the six years between 1958, when the 
construction of the base started, and 1964, China succeeded in 
conducting an experiment with its first atomic bomb. Two years 
later, China succeeded in developing its first hydrogen bomb 
there. Over the past years, China has produced many atomic and 
hydrogen bombs at the base. 
  In those years, the "two-bomb base" was very mysterious. For 
the sake of keeping secrets, the "two-bomb base" was called the 
Qinghai Provincial Mining Zone by outsiders. The base was an 
independent "small society," and all activities of its personnel 
were carried out within the base. Even the dead had to be 
cremated inside the base, and their remains were not allowed to 
be removed. In 1987, the State Council gave its approval to 
closing down the base, and the personnel was pulled out one 
after another. 
  At present, the former site of the "two-bomb base" has 
become 
the seat of the Haibei Zang Nationality Autonomous Prefecture 
Government of Qinghai Province. Because of the enormous scale 
of the "two-bomb base," the transfer work has not been 
officially completed. Next month, the Beihai Autonomous 
Prefecture will officially sign a transfer contract with the 
China National Nuclear Industry Corporation. 
  In those years, the people of the Beihai Autonomous 
Prefecture, those of Haiyan County in particular, paid a 
tremendous price for the construction of the "two-bomb base." 
They vacated more than 1,100 sq. km (equivalent to the total 
area of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories) of their 
best pasture land for the base. The prefecture still has no 
large industrial enterprises. 
  The fixed assets of the base at the time of its closure were 
over 100 million renminbi, after depreciation on the basis of 
their price in 1958. 
  A specialist maintains that a base of the same size could 
not 
be built for less than several billion yuan today. The amount 
of this "legacy" is quite enormous. It includes 560,000 sq. m 
of buildings inside plant premises, 330,000 sq. m of production 
buildings, more than 40 km of special railway lines which 
converge with the Qinghai- Tibet Railway Line, nearly 80 km of 
standard highways, 1,000 six- digit computer-controlled 
telephones, and one thermal power plant with an annual 
generating capacity of 110 million kwh. These facilities can be 
used with slight alterations. They have suddenly turned Haibei 
Autonomous Prefecture into an area with the most convenient 
transportation facilities, the most complete production and 
daily life facilities, and the best environment for investment 
among other prefectures and counties of Qinghai. 
  The Haibei Autonomous Prefecture Government has designated 
the former site of the "two-bomb base" as a "small zone for 
nationality economy development" and has formulated a series of 
preferential policies for investment. At present, the 
feasibility study on the Haibei Autonomous Metal Sodium Plant, 
the Electrolyte Aluminum Plant, the Soda Ash Plant, and the 
Caustic Soda Plant has been approved and put on record, and the 
construction of these projects will soon start on the former 
site of the "two-bomb base." Besides, the Haibei Autonomous 
Prefecture has also planned to build a series of other projects, 
including a power plant, an aluminum plant, a magnesium plant, 
and a carbonization plant. Most of these projects are 
Sino-foreign joint ventures, and the letters of intent for some 
of them have already been signed.

  [Text] Shanghai (CEIS) -- Shanghai, China's leading 
industrial and financial center, has become a new production 
base of nuclear power equipment, according to industry sources. 
The city's power equipment manufacturing industry has provided 
equipment for the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power stations, 
the country's only two nuclear power stations. Recently, the 
industry signed technical agreements to assist the second-phase 
construction of Qinshan and part of the contract for exporting a 
300,000-kw nuclear power plant to Pakistan. So far, the city 
has invested nearly 200 million yuan in its nuclear power 
equipment manufacturing industry, for construction of capital 
projects covering 93,000 square meters. Since 1988, Shanghai 
has also earmarked more than 13 million yuan from its treasury 
to support crucial nuclear power research projects. Sixty-two 
of the research projects have passed appraisals. Meanwhile, 
the central government has commissioned Shanghai to tackle 11 
key research projects related to the construction of a 
600,000-kw nuclear power station, and has allocated more than 12 
million yuan to upgrade Shanghai's nuclear power equipment 
production capacity. During the 1996-2000 period, Shanghai 
will be able to build one to 1.5 sets of nuclear power equipment 
a year.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kang Yong-chin from Bangkok on the </F>
news conference by ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu in the VIP 
room at the Bangkok airport on 17 May] 
  [Text] 
  Reporter: Is there any change in the situation of 
the North Korean nuclear problem? 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu: Although there 
were some hardline remarks, including those of U.S. 
congressional leaders and Defense Secretary Perry, there is no 
noticeable change in the situation. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection 
team, which entered North Korea on 17 May, will pay the greatest 
attention to examining the degree of progress in the replacing 
of fuel rods in the five-megawatt atomic reactor, which North 
Korea announced has already begun. 
  In the event that the inspection team decides that the 
replacement of fuel rods has progressed, exceeding the dangerous 
level designated by the IAEA, it will suspend inspections and 
leave North Korea. 
  It is the right of IAEA to decide this, and both the ROK and 
the United States will respect its decision. 
  It is not an appropriate act for North Korea to have 
independently conducted the replacement of fuel rods without 
IAEA presence. However, if North Korea selected fuel rod 
samples of its own accord and is keeping them, and if there is a 
way for measuring them afterwards, a third round of U.S.-North 
Korea talks may be held. 
  The additional inspection of the radiochemical experimental 
power station in Yongbyon demanded by the UN Security Council 
should also be conducted. 
  It seems difficult that the third round of U.S.-North Korea 
talks will be held late this month. The talks could be possibly 
held early next month. 
  Reporter: There are reports that the United 
States will push for hardline measures against North Korea, 
including sanctions through the UN Security Council, prompted by 
remarks by U.S. congressional leaders. What is your opinion? 
  Minister Han: I understand that they did not mean 
immediate sanctions. Their intention is that sanctions should 
be imposed when the IAEA inspection team's report indicates the 
crossing of the dangerous level. 
  Secretary Perry's remarks that North Korea came to possess 
used nuclear fuel that would enable it to produce four to five 
nuclear weapons means that this would be true when the 
replacement of fuel rods, which is ongoing presently, is totally 
completed. 
  Reporter: Yun Ho-chin, councilor in the North 
Korean mission in Vienna, said that the replacement of fuel rods 
already began a month ago, and that North Korea is now taking 
out fuel rods. 
  Minister Han: The beginning of the replacement 
means that the replacement started from the moment of the 
suspension of operation. Therefore, whether fuel rods were 
actually taken out, and how many rods were taken out will be 
decided only after the IAEA inspection team submits the report. 
  Reporter: More than half of all questions raised 
during the regular briefing by the U.S. State Department in the 
morning of 16 May were related to the North Korean nuclear 
problem. Therefore, it seems that this issue is now in an 
extremely important point. What is your opinion? 
  Minister Han: That is quite natural. The United 
States repeatedly warned in the past that if it decides that 
North Korea has advanced the replacement of fuel rods to a 
considerable extent, it will suspend efforts for solution 
through dialogue. Thus, the situation in which North Korea-U.S. 
dialogue was suspended, means the beginning of discussions of 
sanctions through the UN Security Council. 
  Reporter: In the event that the UN Security 
Council begins discussion for sanctions, what is the future 
prospect of the situation? 
  Minister Han: The replacement of fuel rods is 
quite different from what was an issue in the past. The 
additional inspection should be conducted because North Korea 
"failed to do what it should do," and the replacement of fuel 
rods presents a serious problem because North Korea "is doing 
what it should not do." In the event that North Korea goes 
beyond the line, which it should not cross, the atmosphere in 
the United Nations will change. As a result, I believe, China 
will not show a negative attitude toward sanctions against North 
Korea. 
  Reporter: What is the standard to decide the 
level which North Korea should not go beyond in replacing fuel 
rods? 
  Minister Han: The minimum work in the activities 
that the IAEA should perform is to carry to accomplishment the 
three principles of selecting, storing, and measuring the 
samples of fuel rods. 
  This work is intended to find out past nuclear activities. 
However, the situation, in which one cannot decide what work 
North Korea carried out with the nuclear rods it took out, is 
indeed even more serious. 
  Reporter: Is there any possibility of holding a 
working-level contact between North Korea and the United States 
in order to convey concerns of the international community to 
North Korea even before IAEA forwards the report on the result 
of its inspections? 
  Minister Han: If the inspection team leaves North 
Korea, for instance, tomorrow, a working-level contact will not 
likely be held. 
  It is not likely that a contact will be held before the 
inspection team forwards the report on its inspection results.

  [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- Science and Technology 
Minister Kim Si-chung doubts whether North Korea's Science and 
Technology are so developed as to be used for making nuclear 
bombs and other weapons. In an interview with a science journal, 
Kim said, "If we are to extract plutonium, care should be taken 
to treat (spent nuclear fuel) in such a safe way that allows no 
difference in mass after having it reprocessed." 
  "Reprocessing is possible, but we would require enormous 
time 
and technology in the process of manufacturing nuclear weapons," 
he said in the May edition of "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY." 
  Saying that he was simply talking of his personal opinion, 
Kim noted that there is no evidence that North Korea has 
conducted underground nuclear experiments. "If the North had 
done it, we would have detected it by seismograph," he said. 
  "It is presumed North Korea began extracting plutonium from 
1985, but I doubt whether they have the technology to 
manufacture (nuclear) weapons," Kim said.

    [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 17 May carry 
editorials commenting on the remarks of former opposition leader 
Kim Tae-chung, who is now chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace 
Foundation, APPF, that North Korea's possession of two or three 
atomic bombs would not be much of a problem compared with the 
20,000 nuclear warheads the United States has. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Mr. Kim Tae-chung's View on the North Korean 
Nuclear Issue." Referring to his remarks, the editorial says 
"it is not important how many nuclear bombs North Korea 
possesses but whether it actually has nuclear weapons." The 
editorial then says that it is "hard to understand" the APPF's 
excuse that Kim made the remarks in order to stress the futility 
of North Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons because the 
number of nuclear warheads is not the focus of the nuclear issue. 
  Noting the ongoing international efforts to deter North 
Korea's nuclear development, the editorial holds that his 
remarks are "tantamount to throwing a wet blanket over such 
efforts," and calls on Kim to "clarify his view on the North 
Korean nuclear issue before or after he returns home from the 
United States." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "We Should Not Allow North Korea To Have a 
Nuclear Bomb, Not Even One Nuclear Bomb." Noting that his 
remarks regarding North Korea's nuclear issue has "caused 
ripples at home and abroad," the editorial maintains "regardless 
of the true intent behind his remarks, there is a high 
possibility that the remarks will confuse the government's North 
Korean policy." 
  Stressing the importance of deterring North Korea's nuclear 
development for the nation's interests, the editorial says, "In 
view of this, it is hard to read the true intent of Kim's remark 
that `the ROK and U.S. Governments have complicated the matter 
by not yielding a single point to North Korea.'" The editorial 
concludes that "While we are well aware of where Chairman Kim's 
true heart and aspiration for the improvement of the North-South 
relations lie, as one of the most respected personalities in ROK 
politics, he should refrain from making ambiguous remarks and 
should work towards a unified national view." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Does He Mean That the North's Nuclear Bomb 
Is Tolerable?" Referring to Kim Tae-chung's "shocking" remarks 
on the North's nuclear development the editorial says: "It is 
deplorable that he made such irresponsible remarks at a time 
when the entire nation is working hard to stop North Korea's 
nuclear development." 
  The editorial says Kim's remarks at the Washington's 
National 
Press Club proposing the invitation of Kim Il-song to the United 
States and the appointment of Former President Jimmy Carter as a 
special envoy to Pyongyang should have been "more discreet" 
  The editorial concludes that "he should restrain himself 
from 
making remarks creating uneasiness and confusion among the 
people who call for the transparency of North's nuclear issue 
and want to improve the relations between the North and South."

  [Text] Taegu, May 26 (YONHAP) -- Deputy Prime Minister [and 
chairman of the National Unification Board, NUB] Yi Hong-ku 
stressed on Thursday that the North Korean nuclear question has 
to be resolved not by third parties but by responsible 
authorities of the two Koreas. 
  In a speech at the "Square for Unification Dialogue" held at 
the Hillside Hotel here, Yi said, "to this end, there needs 
government efforts to tackle those productive areas that can be 
agreed on and implemented under the principle of resolution 
between the direct parties involved." 
  He said that since the nuclear issue is an all-important 
question over which the nation's survival is at stake, the 
government's basic stand is that it cannot allow inter-Korean 
exchanges or economic cooperation unless there is a substantial 
progress in nuclear negotiations. 
  "North Korea cannot possess nuclear arms because if they do, 
it would shatter power balance between South and North Korea and 
would possibly lead to giving Japan an excuse to go nuclear 
itself to the prejudice of peace order in Northeast Asia," 
Deputy Premier Yi said. 
  Also saying that the country now needs the kind of education 
to prepare for unification, Yi said the people should now 
prepare to share post-unification burdens.

<F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Group's Criminal Act of Throwing People Into </F>
`Nuclear Hell'"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] 
in a protest message to the traitor Kim Yong-sam May 23 accused 
the traitor of his treason in doing harm to the fellow 
countrymen and working overtime to develop nuclear weapons and 
provoke a nuclear war for destroying the nation in league with 
outside forces, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  Referring to the treacheries committed by Kim Yong-sam 
against the fellow countrymen, hand in glove with foreign 
forces, the message said the present regime had tried hard to 
strengthen an "international cooperation system" designed to 
stifle the North, where fellow countrymen live, and made the 
Korean peninsula a theatre of scramble of nuclear powers by 
taking the unfounded "nuclear issue" of the North even to the 
United Nations, regarding the "system of cooperation with the 
U.S. and Japan" as the main axis. 
  Criticizing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's perfidious acts of 
reversing the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation 
and racing headlong along the road of nuclear armament, the 
message said the present "civilian" regime is not only 
extracting a large amount of nuclear materials from the Wolsong 
heavy water reactor and Taedok multi-purpose research reactor, 
plutonium-yielding reactors built by the preceding military 
regimes, but also promoting even the development of a fast 
breeder reactor, openly crying for "nuclear sovereignty" to 
justify its development of nuclear weapons. 
  Kim Yong-sam's criminal acts to stifle the fellow countrymen 
and throw the people into a "nuclear hell" cannot be tolerated 
any longer, the message said, and added: In case one of the 
nine atomic reactors operating in South Korea and nuclear waste 
accumulated there should explode in actuality, they would emit 
radioactivity that may cause a hideous pollution more than 
10,000 times as great as the total pollution at the time of 
A-bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

  [Text] Seoul, May 26 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government on Thursday reaffirmed the importance of abiding by 
the inter-Korean declaration of the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  The government also resolved to continue to cooperate 
closely 
with the United States and the rest of the world community in 
the effort to rectify North Korea's violation of the 
denuclearization declaration. 
  At a unification and national security policy coordination 
meeting presided over by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku, the 
government decided to continue to maintain the existing policy 
of linking inter-Korean economic cooperation to the resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear question. 
  A Unification Board official said that the meeting, however, 
decided to make flexible conditions for such linkage depending 
on the attitude of North Korea. 
  He said attendees shared the view that it is not proper to 
discuss the issue of reconsidering the denuclearization 
declaration at the present stage. 
  Regarding North Korea's demand for the replacement of the 
existing military armistice agreement, the meeting reaffirmed 
the government policy that such a replacement should be 
discussed between the two Koreas once confience-building is 
fostered in the areas of politics and military between the two 
sides. 
  "Attending officials affirmed that the linkage of economic 
cooperation to the nuclear issue cannot be withdrawn," said Kim 
Hyong-ki, spokesman for the National Unification Board. 
  The attendees also expressed concern about a situation in 
which North Korea may refuse to provide nuclear transparency, 
challenging South Korea's efforts to abide by the 
denuclearization declaration, Kim added.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Japan is strongly seeking 
North Korea's acceptance of full international inspections of 
its nuclear sites suspected of being used to produce nuclear 
weapons, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said Thursday 
[19 May]. 
  "We think North Korea has yet to allay concerns that it is 
diverting its nuclear materials for military use," the top 
government spokesman told a news conference. 
  "We therefore want North Korea to accept in earnest full 
nuclear inspections demanded by the IAEA (International Atomic 
Energy Agency)," he said. 
  The IAEA, the Vienna-based international nuclear watchdog, 
has started monitoring the changing of fuel rods at a 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers 
north of the North Korean capital. 
  But it is suspected that Pyongyang has already started the 
process of removing spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor 
despite warnings that international monitors need to be present.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 KYODO -- Japanese political 
leader Masayoshi Takemura met U.S. Defense Secretary William 
Perry and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili 
at the Pentagon on Monday [23 May]. 
  An aide to Takemura, leader of new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger], later told reporters that Perry showed strong 
interest on the current state of Japanese politics and asked 
Takemura for his views on its impact on Japan's foreign policy. 
  New party Sakigake is a splinter group of the largest 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Takemura served as 
chief cabinet secretary of the previous government of former 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Takemura, whose party quit the ruling coalition last month, 
assured Perry that Japan will stick by its close relationship 
with the United States under the present government of Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata or any future "post-Hata" government. 
  Takemura also told Perry that "there is no doubt" that Japan 
will play its part in implementing any sanctions the United 
Nations may impose on North Korea in connection with its 
suspected nuclear arms development. 
  Takemura is currently on a private visit to the U.S. 
  He is expected to meet other senior U.S. Government 
officials 
before leaving for San Francisco to give an address, the aide 
said.

  [Text] Fukui, May 20 KYODO -- Japan's prototype fast 
breeder reactor "Monju" is now fully loaded with fuel and ready 
for going "critical" throughout the entire core, the 
governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. 
said Friday [20 May]. 
  The last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the 
core 
the same day, and the reactor is now set for full chain 
reactions of nuclear fission. 
  Monju, located in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, is expected to 
reach critical state early Sunday. 
  The controversial fast breeder reactor reached criticality 
for the first time on April 5, with 168 fuel assemblies 
installed. 
  The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide 
and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel 
60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. 
  Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in 
the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction 
without outside stimulus. 
  Since the reactor reached criticality, the governmental 
agency has been gradually installing the remaining fuel 
assemblies, while experimenting with the critical conditions by 
inserting and removing some of the 19 neutron-absorbing control 
rods. 
  The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further 
tests in this chain reaction stage before turbines are connected 
in April next year for generating electricity. Full operation 
is scheduled to start in December 1995.

  [Text] Fukui, May 22 KYODO -- Japan's new plutonium-fueled 
fast breeder reactor "Monju" on the Sea of Japan coast went 
"critical" through its entire core at 12:43 a.m. Sunday [22 
May], the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corp. said. 
  Criticality is the point at which the neutrons produced in 
the fission process are sufficient to sustain a chain reaction 
without outside stimulus. 
  The loading of Monju with fuel was completed Friday, when 
the 
last of the 198 fuel assemblies was installed in the core. 
  Since then, the government agency has been gradually 
removing 
the neutron-absorbing control rods allowing the reactor to reach 
full criticality. 
  The fast breeder reactor in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, 
reached criticality for the first time April 5, with 168 fuel 
assemblies installed. 
  The reactor, which is fueled by a mixture of plutonium oxide 
and uranium oxide, is believed to have the potential to use fuel 
60 times more efficiently than conventional uranium reactors. 
  The 280,000-kilowatt prototype reactor will undergo further 
tests in this chain reaction stage before its output will 
gradually be increased in February next year. 
  The 600 billion yen plant is scheduled to go on line 
generating electricity from April 1995 and become a commercially 
operating supplier by December the same year.

  [Text] Sendai, May 18 KYODO -- The Miyagi Prefectural 
Government has decided to disclose information concerning the 
delivery of nuclear material shipments to and from a power plant 
in the prefecture, prefectural government sources said Wednesday 
[18 May]. 
  The central government in Tokyo, however, is opposing the 
prefecture's plan. 
  "This decision...is regrettable," said Kenichi Maruyama, an 
official of the Nuclear Safety Bureau of the Science and 
Technology Agency. 
  He said management of information relating to transport of 
nuclear fuel falls within an international framework and the 
Miyagi Government's unilateral decision "deviates from this." 
  The central government in April 1993 advised power plant 
localities to avoid divulging such information as a precaution 
against sensitive materials falling into the wrong hands. 
  The Miyagi Government has decided to reveal information 
regarding the shipping of spent nuclear fuel from the Onagawa 
plant run by Tohoku Electric Power Co., the first such public 
disclosure in Japan. 
  While the information will not include the time of 
transport, 
name of ship or route taken, it will detail such things as fuel 
quantity, container type, country of destination and whereabouts 
of a reprocessing plant. 
  The decision was made in response to the urging of a local 
antinuclear group. 
  Maruyama said the agency intends to summon Miyagi Government 
officials to discuss the situation. 
  He said the prefecture will be advised to tighten its 
control 
of information, taking into consideration the negative overseas 
reaction that public disclosure of such information would likely 
generate, as well as how it would adversely affect other 
prefectures.

  [Text] Quoting a Japanese military source, YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
reported today that North Korea is making moves to test-fire a 
missile. 
  According to this military source, a U.S. information 
satellite caught these moves by North Korea, and the U.S. 
Government informed the Japanese Government of this. 
  The military source said it is highly possible that North 
Korea will soon carry out the second missile test fire which 
follows its first test fire of the Nodong No. 1 missile toward 
the East Sea in May of last year. 
  Regarding these moves by North Korea at a time when it is 
the 
focus of the international community because of its nuclear 
issue, the Japanese military source analyzed that North Korea is 
trying to test-fire a missile while weather over the East Sea is 
calm.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 28 (YONHAP) -- U.S. reconnaissance 
satellites detected preparations by North Korea to test-launch a 
new missile about two weeks ago, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN reported in 
its Saturday editions. 
  Quoting military sources here who were informed of the 
North's movements by the United States Government, YOMIURI said, 
"there is a possibility North Korea would soon test-fire a 
second missile following the launch of the Nodong-I missile in 
the East Sea in may last year." 
  According to the YOMIURI report, many trucks, launchers and 
other vehicles have been sent to the detected launch site and 
vessels were swarming around ports along the east coast, 
apparently to determine the landing point of the missiles to be 
launched. 
  Asked why the North would try to test a new missile when the 
international community's attention is already focused on its 
suspected nuclear weapons program, the sources said, "the action 
seems to be timed with the warm seasonal weather conditions in 
the East Sea and we do not believe North Korea has any 
particular political intention of influencing nuclear 
negotiations." 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN carried a similar story, quoting Foreign 
Ministry officials as saying that "we obtained information that 
North Korea is preparing to test-launch a missile in the East 
Sea." 
  The officials said the information had been supplied by the 
United States, adding, "the missile to be launched by the North 
this time appears to be a revised version of the Nodong-I 
missile," according to the TOKYO SHIMBUN. 
  "Washington and Pyongyang are likely to hold a third round 
of 
high-level talks soon, regardless of the attempt by the North to 
test-launch a missile," according to the officials, who hinted 
they had the impression that Washington considers the North's 
missile launch as a separate issue from the talks. 
  The North's Nodong-I that was test-launched in May last year 
has a range of 1,000 km.

  [Text] Mr. Kim Tae-ho, a worker at a North Korean uranium 
processing plant, who defected to the ROK on 7 May, revealed 
that the Workers Party's second economic committee under the 
direct control of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il, had been 
carrying out nuclear development with massive capital 
investment, and that North Korea had extracted 12 kg of 
plutonium in 1988. Mr. Kim gave an interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
today in Seoul. 
  He also said: While the Atomic Energy Ministry [wonjaryok 
kongoppu] appears to be in charge of North Korea's nuclear 
development, in reality, Secretary Chon Pyong-ho of the Workers 
Party's second economic committee, is in charge of nuclear 
development at the instruction of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. 
  Mr. Kim Tae-ho also said that many researcher friends had 
told him that North Korea extracted 12 kg of plutonium for the 
first time in the summer of 1988 by using the spent fuel at the 
5-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and that the amount is 
enough to produce two nuclear bombs. 
  Mr. Kim also said that there was a coup attempt in the 
military last year, and that all involved, were arrested.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 19 May (ACAN-EFE) -- Official 
sources reported today that Guatemalan state security forces 
defused nine explosive devices that guerrillas had planted in 
several places throughout the capital city as well as in the 
countryside. 
  Police found two fragmentation grenades and guerrilla 
propaganda in the community of Molino de las Flores, south of 
Guatemala City. The guerrilla propaganda demands that the 
government and the Armed Forces honor the global agreements on 
respect for human rights. 
  Six other explosives were uncovered in the southern sector 
of 
the city, including three RPG-7 rocket launchers. 
  In addition, a Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) 
propaganda bomb was defused in Chichicastenango, in the 
northwestern part of Quiche Department. 
  According to the National Police, approximately 50 explosive 
devices have been defused so far in 1994.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 19 
May. 
  Ranchers who for years have been paying "war taxes" to the 
guerrillas have turned down a proposal by Defense Minister Mario 
Enriquez to arm their workers to defend themselves against the 
rebels. Arturo Guirola Batres, president of the Coordinating 
Committee for Agricultural, Financial, Commercial, and 
Industrial Associations, said the farmers appreciate the 
proposal but feel they must reject it because it would mean 
creating an army in addition to the regular one. (Guatemala 
PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 13 May 94 p 2) 
  The Guatemalan Army has confirmed that Israel Hernandez y 
Hernandez, president of the Voluntary Civil Defense Committee, 
was kidnapped by a guerrilla group in San Luis Municipality, 
Peten Department, according to the Information and Press 
Department of the Army, DIDE. Hernandez y Hernandez's son was 
also kidnapped. (Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 15 May 
94 p 7) 
  Three soldiers were killed over the weekend after stepping 
on 
mines placed by the guerrillas in a private farm in the 
northwestern department of Solola, the Army reported on 16 May. 
(Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1507 GMT 16 May 94) 
  At least seven high-powered grenades were defused in 
different areas of the Guatemalan capital by the National 
Police, official sources have reported. Three of the grenades 
were found next to URNG propaganda. The other four grenades 
were found and defused in Zones 7 and 11 in Guatemala City.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Cortes and Luis Jimenez] </F>
  [Excerpt] Cortes: The explosion took place 
exactly 800 meters from the Plaza Paitilla Inn on Via Italia. 
This happened at approximately 0820 [1320 GMT] this morning. 
Information gathered by RPC Radio from PTJ [Judicial Technical 
Police] agents reveals that the person wounded is Colombian Adan 
Schwartz. He was seriously injured. His car was parked outside 
the Tamaco Building. 
  Jimenez, interrupting: The Tamanaco Building. 
  Cortes: Excuse me -- the Tamanaco Building, where 
he lives. This is where Colombian citizen Adan Schwartz lives. 
He was injured and taken to Paitilla Hospital. 
  On 13 May, Mr. Schwartz witnessed a kidnapping attempt in 
this same building. It seems the kidnappers were constantly 
following him. Last night, they managed to place a bomb in the 
rear of his car, a Cherokee four-wheel drive vehicle. It is a 
blue vehicle with brown molding on the sides and the license 
plate 521054. 
  It is worth noting that he was being tailed because he had 
witnessed a kidnapping. The kidnappers felt he gave some 
information to the PTJ linking them to a kidnapping attempt in 
the Tamanaco Building in the Punta Paitilla area. [sentence as 
heard] 
  This is the part of the information we have been able to 
gather in the area of Punta Paitilla. The National Police are 
still cordoning off the area. Another vehicle was also damaged 
as a result of the explosion. By the way, a black Cherokee 
four-wheel drive vehicle was behind the vehicle that exploded. 
Some shrapnel also hit nearby homes. 
  This is what is happening. The National Police are still 
investigating the incident and promise to provide details later. 
  We should also note that the driver of the black Cherokee 
who 
was driving behind the car that exploded this morning was 
unhurt, although the vehicle was badly damaged. The driver is a 
Jewish citizen. We tried to talk to him -- this man who 
witnessed everything -- but he refused to comment. 
  Jimenez: In terms of the injured, we first learned 
one person was injured in the explosion. Later, we were 
informed someone else was injured. 
  Cortes: This is what we have. We talked to some 
witnesses, and one told us that he was walking nearby when he 
heard the blast. When he turned around, he saw someone exiting 
the vehicle. It seems this person was seriously wounded. This 
is what the witness said. [passage omitted]

Barranca, and Arequipa, revealed all this information and 
radically cut the resources MRTA received from Peruvian business 
people through either blackmail or abductions. 
  In the meantime, MRTA terrorists continue receiving money 
from drug traffickers in Upper Huallaga whom they protect when 
transporting drugs from one place to another or shipping drugs 
abroad. 
  According to our sources, Comrade Polo's confessions, and an 
assessment of the documents and archives the Divicote-2 agents 
confiscated from MRTA strongholds revealed that the money was 
distributed as follows: 
  Part of it was deposited in current bank accounts in Paris, 
France, where Hugo Avellaneda Valdez, Comrade Eloy, lives. 
Avellaneda Valdez, who is MRTA international coordinator, is in 
charge of distributing the money together with other MRTA 
leaders living abroad and with leaders of the MIR [Movement of 
the Revolutionary Left] international wing. 
  Deposits are made by computer via "modems," which were 
seized 
at one MRTA stronghold raided by counterterrorist agents. 
  As we reported some days ago, the MIR international wing is 
financed by contributions by American and European terrorist 
groups, to whom they send weapons and highly trained subversive 
elements in military tactics. 
  Another part of the money is withheld by the terrorist 
leaders in Lima to pay foreign -- Chilean -- terrorists for the 
crimes committed together with MRTA and for the logistics 
apparatus that was run by terrorist Ramos Edison Loayza Alferez 
(arrested). 
  This group used the money to buy or rent houses used as 
strongholds; to purchase vehicles, weapons -- brought from 
abroad, computers, faxes, and communications equipment; and to 
set up clandestine workshops to make military or police uniforms.

  [Text] The terrorists who attacked an Army helicopter in 
Quebrada Pena Blanca (Chanchamayo) on 12 May may be members of 
an MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] column that 
protects some five "firms" of drug traffickers operating on the 
outskirts of the jungle in that region. 
  This was asserted by Interior Ministry intelligence sources, 
according to which the terrorists allegedly come from San Luis 
de Shuaro. 
  The terrorists belong to one of the MRTA columns that have 
lost their slight ideological tint, and are surviving as a 
mercenary group protecting a Mexican "firm" that is allegedly 
trying to grow poppy plants in the surroundings of Sanchirio, 
Alto Batinaki, Santa Herminia, and on the banks of the 
Paucartambo River near Villa Rica. 
  This, however, is not the only organization of foreign drug 
traffickers: Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers operate in 
the region in cahoots with Peruvian traffickers. 
  Intelligence experts maintain that this MRTA column, and 
those located on the outskirts of the Satipo (Junin) and 
Oxapampa (Pasco) jungle, enjoy the compulsory help of peasant 
and indigenous communities, whose leaders and heads of family 
are forced, under threats of death, to cultivate coca leaf, 
marijuana, and poppies. 
  They are also forced to produce washed cocaine paste, which 
provides the MRTA with a significant income. 
  According to information obtained from peasants in Villa 
Rica, 500 kg of washed cocaine paste are shipped to Colombia 
each week. This represents an income per shipment for the 
terrorists of approximately $225,000, taking into account that 
the drugs are sold at $1,800 per kilo and the terrorists collect 
25 percent of the total amount. 
  As for the "political military" organization of that 
terrorist group, the analysts believe that the MRTA Central 
Regional Committee has lost its geographical domain. In other 
words, it no longer has the same control it used to exercise in 
Pasco and Junin, and only survives due to its link with drug 
traffickers. 
  Another source of income is allegedly the protection fees 
the 
MRTA members charge merchants, businessmen, and passengers 
traveling through San Francisco, Esperanza, Miraflores, and 
Villa Rica in Oxapampa (Pasco).

  [Text] Lima, 25 May (EFE) -- In a communique issued today 
in Lima, the Huallaga Military Command reports that a total of 
30 Shining Path (SL) members were arrested by Army patrols in 
the Huallaga jungle area. 
  The communique adds that the "narcoterrorist criminals," as 
they are described in the official report, were arrested during 
military operations in the Huallaga region, encompassing San 
Martin and Huanuco Departments. The communique, however, does 
not specify the dates the arrests were made. 
  The communique also reports that on 24 May, an Army patrol 
seized guns, explosives, ammunition, medicine, and propaganda 
material from a terrorist group in Leoncio Prado Province's Arab 
district, in Huanuco Department. 
  Peruvian security forces have been conducting an 
antiterrorist military operation in Leoncio Prado since 5 April 
against SL columns, which have been disrupted. 
  According to previous official communiques, military patrols 
killed 15 SL members and arrested another 11 in Leoncio Prado 
and Pachitea between 20 and 23 May. 
  Moreover, special prosecutor for terrorist crimes Daniel 
Espichan reported today that so far a total of 4,138 terrorists 
have resorted to the repentance law. Those terrorists who use 
this law or cooperate with security forces have their sentences 
reduced. 
  Espichan added that this figure does not include those who 
surrendered in the Huallaga region, whose number was not 
specified. 
  In a statement to the press, Espichan added that 4,800 
people 
are imprisoned in several national jails on charges of 
perpetrating terrorist crimes.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Peruvian authorities 
arrested a member of an ultraleftist guerrilla group who 
allegedly planned and commanded the 1991 murders of three 
Japanese aid workers, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Friday 
[20 May]. 
  Terusuke Terada told a press conference that Peruvian 
authorities on Wednesday arrested Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, a 
member of the Shining Path, for allegedly planning and then 
overseeing the murders of the three engineers from the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on July 12, 1991. 
  The latest development brought the total number of arrests 
made in connection with the case to 10, he said. 
  The three JICA engineers were killed during a raid by the 
Shining Path on an agricultural cooperative in central Peru. 
  Seventeen members of the Maoist guerrilla group were said to 
have been involved in the murders, he said.

  [Text] Srinagar, May 22 -- Deeply concerned about the 
sagging morale of most of the militant groups operating in Jammu 
and Kashmir [J-K], because of their failure to hit at the 
assigned targets and to unleash violence, Pakistan's Inter 
Services Intelligence [ISI] has reportedly despatched a fresh 
group of 400 armed mercenaries into the Valley during the past 
few weeks. 
  They have come with very clear directions to take leadership 
of the militant outfits and to plan large scale subversive 
operations. The latest infiltration, it is learnt, has taken 
place through Kupwara and Uri sectors. 
  According to sources, the increasing disillusionment of the 
people with the militants has upset the senior command officers 
of the ISI. There have been instances during the recent months 
when the people have openly defied militants' orders and refused 
to support their cause. Today's Id celebration was yet another 
pointer to the fact that the people no longer approved the cult 
of violence being indulged in by Pakistan-supported militant 
groups. 
  It is learnt that the new group of mercenaries, including 
Pakistan trained Afghan guerillas, militant from POK 
[Pakistan-occupied Kashmir], Sudan and other West Asian 
Countries, have entered India through unmanned routes along the 
LoC [Line of Control]. They have also smuggled in sophisticated 
arms including, AK56 and AK-76 assault rifles, rockets and 
rocket launchers. 
  It is learnt that ISI, which has been openly aiding and 
abetting militancy in J-K, has conveyed its disgust and 
annoyance to some of the leading militant groups here for their 
failure to organise subversive operations and to hit at soft 
targets. Instead of accomplishing the task given by ISI, the 
militant groups have of late been killing their own people as 
most of the outfits lacked motivation and fought among 
themselves. 
  It is for this reason that Pakistan has decided to enlist 
the 
support of trained Afghan Mojahedin to infiltrate into the 
Valley and to take over the operational command of the militant 
groups. According to sources, the reason ISI decided to send 
Afghan Mojahedin was that they are trained in handling highly 
sophisticated weapons, and secondly, were motivated to 
accomplish the assigned field responsibilities. 
  Sources indicate that in view of ISI's increasing 
desperation, the security agencies had anticipated that as soon 
as the ISl's field intelligence units succeeded in identifying a 
safe unmanned route along the international border, they would 
make a determined bid to `push in' about 2000 to 2500 trained 
Mojahedin. 
  Other apprehension is that the militants, who had set up 
their bases in the Peerpanjal range would advance with the 
clearing of snow. This shift in the bases would pose a serious 
threat to the national highway and the troops and vehicular 
movement on it. 
  This happened last year also when the militants attacked the 
army convoys and the security forces from the hilltops and 
inflicted casualties. Though the security forces effectively 
replied to these attacks yet the militants' vantage position 
aided them in attacking and then fleeing back to their hideouts 
in the range. 
  The militants are planning to fortify the existing bases and 
to create new ones on the frontline of the Peerpanjal range. The 
target is the national highway for it serves as a vital link 
between the Valley and the rest of the country. It is important 
for the security forces also as most of their supplies arrive 
via this route. The movement of the troops also depends on this 
road which is surrounded by high mountains on both sides. 
  That the militants are increasingly targeting the highway 
was 
evident from the fact when they even attacked the Border Roads 
Organisation men.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Lebanese Government and the </F>
Iranian Hostages in Israeli Captivity"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the country's newspapers reported that 
sources close to the Lebanese Government have stated that the 
four Iranian hostages who were taken captive in Beirut in 1982 
have been handed over to officials of the Zionist regime. [see 
item LD0905163994 in previous Terrorism Report] The unofficial 
nature of this report prevents the officials of the Foreign 
Ministry to question officially the Lebanese Government on this 
issue. 
  Following the arrest of Samir Ja'ja', SALAM carried a 
commentary discussing the responsibility of the Lebanese 
Government at a time when it has gained relative control over 
the affairs of its country. The commentary underlined the need 
to clarify the fate of the Iranian hostages. The Iranian 
ambassador in Beirut also met with Lebanese officials to discuss 
the issue. Public opinion and the concerned families of the 
Iranian hostages are anticipating an answer from a government 
which has undertaken the affairs of Lebanon. 
  Basically speaking, with increased control by the Lebanese 
Government over various areas and especially over Beirut, it is 
only natural for the [Israelis] to have considered it dangerous 
-- security-wise -- to look after the Iranian diplomats who were 
taken hostage. It is possible though, that the Iranian hostages 
were taken from the very start to occupied Palestine and 
directly questioned by the Zionists. The Israelis were 
confident that with the border conflicts and their presence in 
South Lebanon, they too would have hostages. Thus, they 
considered the exchange of the valuable Iranian hostages for 
other hostages as one of the solutions. 
  At any rate, it is now the duty of the Lebanese Government 
to 
clearly state that the Iranian hostages are being held captive 
by the Zionists. Following this step by the Lebanese 
Government, ways for freeing the Iranian hostages from the 
clutches of the Zionists will be found.

operating deep in Lebanon's al-Biqa' region captured and brought 
to Israel Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of a radical terrorist 
organization which took navigator Ron Arad captive in 1986. Al- 
Dirani heads an organization called the Believer's Resistance. 
An IDF spokesman reported that all our forces returned safely 
to base. 
  A REUTERS reporter in al-Biqa' reported that an IDF force 
flew by helicopter to al-Dirani's village of Qasr al-Nabah), 
which is located 10 kilometers from Zahlah. The commando force

  [Text] A military source made the following statement this 
morning: 
  At 0200 today, an Israeli enemy commando force, using two 
helicopters, kidnapped resistance official al-Haj Mustafa 
al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba village. The Israeli 
force used the road separating Kasrawan and al-Biqa' to carry 
out its action. 
  It should be recalled that Israeli helicopters were 
monitored 
flying at high altitude last night. The Lebanese army and 
Syrian forces were placed on alert. Patrols pursued the Israeli 
commando force in Qasr Naba and al-Furzul. Ground defenses 
opened fired at the helicopters as they were retreating toward 
the sea. 
  This operation is part of the enemy's piracy and continued 
violations of international laws and norms.

<F P=106> [By Selim Yassine] </F>
  [Text] Qasr Naba, Lebanon, May 21 (AFP)--Israeli commandos 
met with no resistance as they kidnapped a Moslem fundamentalist 
guerrilla chief in a slick pre-dawn raid on his home on 
Saturday, his brother said. 
  "There were around 25 men all dressed in Israeli military 
uniform," said Subhi al-Dirani, the brother of Mustafa al-Dirani 
who was snatched by the helicopter-borne commandos from his home 
in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon. 
  "They did not meet with any resistance when they grabbed 
Mustafa in front of his family," and no one was hurt, he said. 
  Mustafa al-Dirani, 46, is held responsible by Israel for the 
capture of airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south 
Lebanon in 1986. The abduction is seen as a bargaining chip in 
the release of the pilot. 
  "No one in the village heard the helicopters which brought 
the commandos." 
  "The soldiers stormed the house out of nowhere and 
immediately went into the bedroom where my brother and his wife 
were sleeping," Subhi al-Dirani said. 
  "They handcuffed me with cuffs made in England and pointed 
their guns at my father, my sister-in-law and her three 
children, grabbed my brother and fled on foot. The whole thing 
lasted 10 minutes," the 26-year-old added. 
  He said the commandos spoke in Hebrew with each other "but 
they spoke to us in Arabic." 
  Lebanese army troops threw a security cordon around the Niha 
hills, which overlook Qasr Naba, five kilometers (three miles) 
away where the two helicopters used by the commandos had landed. 
  Witnesses said the commandos drove by jeep from the hill to 
al-Dirani's house, which is located on the edge of the village, 
and drove back to the waiting choppers. 
  Some villagers said they had seen an exchange of light 
signals before the operation, suggesting that the commandos had 
accomplices inside the village who gave them the all clear.

<F P=106> [News conference by Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin with </F>
domestic correspondents at the Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Rabin: [passage omitted] Last night, 
the IDF carried out an operation -- an operation which the IDF, 
the State of Israel, and lovers of freedom and the fight against 
terror can be proud of. The operation was unanimously approved 
by all the members of the inner cabinet in a meeting on 19 May. 
Its purpose was to bring here the man who today heads a 
terrorist organization operating against us in the security zone 
-- the Believers Resistance -- and who held Ron Arad for at 
least two years and who, I hope, will definitely be able to give 
us information about the period during which he held him and 
perhaps about his condition later on. 
  The operation was conducted on the basis of our 
responsibility for the MIA's and the POW's. This time, the 
reasons I had for submitting my recommendation to the inner 
cabinet were not the same as those I had at the time when I 
recommended to the inner cabinet to bring Shaykh 'Ubayd to 
Israel. At that time, I had hoped that Shaykh 'Ubayd would 
serve as a bargaining chip in the negotiations. I no longer have 
any illusions that anybody can be used as a bargaining chip in 
the negotiations -- certainly not Mustafa al- Dirani. Our goal 
was to further exhaust the chances of obtaining information 
about what happened in the past and the current fate of Ron 
Arad. This operation was also part of our fight against 
Lebanese terrorism directed at the security zone. [passage 
omitted] 
  Israel Television Channel 1's political correspondent 
Gadi Sukenik: Mr. Rabin, with all due respect to those who 
executed the operation, of course, could not such an operation 
have been carried out during the seven years that Ron Arad has 
been in captivity and to this day in order to extract 
information from people such as al-Dirani? To this day, is 
there any certainty that Ron Arad is alive? 
  Rabin: [passage omitted] This operation could have 
been carried out a few months ago, but it was put off because of 
intelligence considerations and chances of obtaining 
information. It was designed to be carried out in a specific 
area -- in that area where the operation took place. Therefore, 
the timing chosen was the first possible time after another 
channel and hope of obtaining information through other means 
were blocked. 
  Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Dov Gilhar: 
Mr. Rabin, what is the next stage? Assuming that Mustafa 
al-Dirani confirms that he handed Ron Arad over to the Iranians, 
is it now a question of international pressure on Tehran? What 
are the next moves? 
  Rabin: At the moment, I do not want to say what 
we will find out in the course of his interrogation. 
Furthermore, I should say that the unit, which carried out the 
operation admirably -- I would like to congratulate the chief of 
staff, the General Staff, the chief of intelligence, the Air 
Force commander, and particularly the soldiers who carried out 
the mission and the pilots who flew them -- also brought with it 
a considerable amount of written material which will certainly 
throw light on some points. When I presented my recommendation 
to the inner cabinet two days ago and asked it to approve the 
operation, I said that we must exhaust any lead and any way that 
will offer us more information. I cannot assure you that we 
will get conclusive information about the whereabouts and 
condition of Ron Arad today. I can assure you that such 
operations will also be carried out in the future, if they are 
necessary and if possible, because we bear responsibility for 
all the MIA's and POW's whose fate has not yet been conclusively 
determined by Israel and the IDF. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [News conference by Lt. Gen. Ehud Baraq, chief of staff, and </F>
Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, chief of the Intelligence Branch, with 
domestic correspondents at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv -- 
live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A considerable number of 
weapons were found in the building [unspecified], including a 
loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside, which he had no time 
to use, just as others had no such opportunity as a result of 
the element of surprise. Numerous documents of all kinds -- not 
just written ones -- were found. [passage omitted] 
  The objectives of the operation were fully attained. 
Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation 
will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard 
to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must 
be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sagi: Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the 
Believers Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization. 
He headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of 
his duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF 
soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and 
until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the 
Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now 
merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body, 
however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA 
[South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His 
involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at 
least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable 
information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been 
largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the 
effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa 
al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even 
conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to 
the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad. [passage 
omitted] 
  Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon 
Ben-David: Mr. Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a 
few minutes ago that al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to 
provide us with a bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release. 
Before we set out on this operation, did we have any 
information to the effect that this abduction will bring Ron 
Arad's return to Israel somewhat closer? 
  Baraq: In my opinion, the main thing to be 
obtained is a better understanding on our part -- as a result of 
what will emerge from the investigation and of a thorough 
analysis of the papers and other documents we seized there -- as 
to what exactly happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end 
of a thread leading to somebody who held him in his hands and 
apparently handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a 
better understanding may surface later as to how to act in the 
future in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel. 
  Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel: 
Mr. Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method 
of operation in the village last night? 
  Baraq: I think it would not be right to detail 
the methods of operation on television. I cannot swear to you 
that this will be the last time we will have to use these 
operational tools, which are very important and sensitive and 
contribute a great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell 
you that this is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the 
better we manage to conceal and cloud the details of the 
operation, the better it will be. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Alon Pinkas] </F>
  [Excerpt] The questioning of abducted "Believers 
Resistance" leader Mustafa al-Dirani is progressing as expected, 
senior army sources said yesterday, and he is cooperating with 
his interrogators and has already provided useful information on 
various issues. 
  At the same time, IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and South 
Lebanon Army units were put on a heightened alert following 
Hizballah threats and corroborating intelligence indicators that 
the Shi'ite organizations plan to avenge the Saturday kidnapping 
of al-Dirani. 
  In the aftermath of the al-Dirani abduction, OC Northern 
Command Maj. Gen. Yitzhaq Mordekhay said that warnings and some 
indications of a possible reprisal necessitated taking all 
precautionary measures. Similar precautions in towns and 
kibbutzim in the north will be made, pending developments in the 
next few days. 
  Israeli diplomats and Israeli offices and installations 
abroad were also put on alert for fear of possible retaliation 
from Hizballah or proxy organizations. 
  Meanwhile, al-Dirani's interrogation continued in an 
undisclosed location in Israel. 
  The chief of Intelligence Branch, Maj. Gen. Uri Sagi, told 
yesterday's cabinet meeting that al-Dirani's intelligence value 
exceeds the issue of missing navigator Ron Arad. [passage 
omitted] 
  Army sources said that al-Dirani himself, and documents 
found 
in his house in Qasr Naba, may shed light on Hizballah 
activities, as well as financial networking and relations with 
Iranian and Syrian agents. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Beirut, 23 May (MENA)--A political official in 
Hizballah has warned that the Lebanese Islamic resistance will 
respond violently to the abduction of Shaykh Mustafa al-Dirani 
by Israeli commandos two days ago. The official predicted a 
rise in effective attacks by the Islamic resistance in the near 
future. Israel may be able to abduct hostages, he said, but it 
cannot twist the arm of the resistance or dissuade it from 
pursuing its strategic task of confronting occupation and 
repelling aggression against the Lebanese people and land. 
[passage omitted] 
  Reiterating Hizballah's position on the Israeli navigator, 
al-Musawi said that Hizballah has no information about the 
navigator's fate. He pointed out that Mustafa al-Dirani, 
although a resistance figure, has no organizational link with 
Hizballah. 
  'Ammar al-Musawi expressed doubt that al-Dirani has any 
information about the Israeli navigator. He expressed his 
belief that Israel, in carrying out the abduction, may have 
benefited from some loopholes in the internal security 
situation. Al-Musawi said that the Lebanese authorities have an 
urgent duty to protect the resistance in every part of Lebanon, 
north or south. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Hizballah Secretary General 
Hasan Nasrallah stressed the need for the "flaccid leadership to 
stop putting restrictions and limitations on the scope of the 
work of the resistance, which is a sacred weapon. The scope of 
the resistance must expand with the expansion of the scope of 
the aggression." He explained that this does not mean there 
should be self-security [for Hizballah] or that this will result 
in chaos but that there should be cooperation and measures that 
would enable the people to stand on the side of the state. 
While Nasrallah did not rule out the possibility of an internal 
breach [of security by a double agent], he said the fate of 
Israeli navigator Ron Arad is a riddle "we cannot solve." 
  Nasrallah made these remarks at a news conference held at 
the 
Hizballah Information Mobilization office in Harat Hurayk [in 
Beirut's Southern Suburb] yesterday to discuss the kidnapping of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, one of the leaders of the "Believers' 
Resistance." The news conference was held amid stringent 
security measures. 
  Nasrallah opened his news conference by noting that the 
targeting of one of the symbols of the resistance is an 
unleashing of the Zionist terrorism that is backed by U.S. 
equipment and technology and "encouraged by the international 
collusion manifested in its ugliest form in the way it dealt 
with the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and the various Zionist enemy 
attacks on Lebanon and the region." [passage omitted] 
  He warned that the confrontation is no longer restricted to 
a 
limited geographic area and that all the Lebanese territories 
are now vulnerable to Zionist violations and aggression. He 
said the resistance weapon is sacred wherever it may be and that 
the scope of resistance can stretch with the expansion of the 
area of aggression. "Therefore, the relaxed leaders must 
refrain from laying down restrictions, drawing limits, and 
specifying the area of resistance activity, because all this is 
a luxury and theoretical talk that has nothing to do with the 
reality of the challenge and suffering," he said, emphasizing 
that enhancing and protecting the resistance in the face of the 
Israeli profanity is one of the main prerequisites for 
establishing real national peace in this country. 
  Cautioning that the Gaza Agreement still gives the Zionist 
enemy an extra footing, Nasrallah called for serious action to 
thwart it and prepare for a new, massive revival against the 
Israeli schemes. He maintained that the kidnapping method was a 
new message with major implications. "It was targeted against 
the resistance, the homeland, the nation, domestic social peace, 
and the security of Lebanon and the region. Most probably the 
goal is far beyond what the enemy has announced regarding the 
search for information on the seized navigator. It even seeks 
political objectives within the Zionist entity," Nasrallah said. 
He stressed that the process of planning, reacting to, and 
dealing with that incident must be as big as the implications, 
the risks, and the objectives the enemy has attached to it. 
  Nasrallah concluded by saying: As long as the enemy has 
opted to expand the scope of confrontation, it must bear the 
responsibility for that decision, because the resistance 
fighters' and mujahidin response will come from where they 
expect and where they do not. Anyway, he said, the battle will 
be long. Victory will be ours and shame and destruction will be 
the share of the Zionist occupiers. 
  Nasrallah then answered correspondents' questions. He 
remarked that "local infiltration is possible" but that the 
issue "is sheer speculation." He explained that party elements 
have visited the target area and gathered information from the 
people. "The picture is taking final shape as far as we are 
concerned, if it has not already materialized." 
  He pointed out that the area was experiencing storming 
operations. "We were careful to avoid problems, because our 
policy is to facilitate the work of the authorities concerned. 
This atmosphere was used to achieve a better performance in 
that operation," he said. He revealed that gaps existed, 
denying the party's responsibility for them. "The Israeli 
operation could have been costly," he remarked, stressing the 
need for cooperation with the Lebanese Army and the Syrian 
forces to block these gaps. 
  Answering a question, Nasrallah said: We demand neither 
self- imposed nor relaxed security. What we want to say is that 
there should be cooperation and measures that enable the people 
to stand by the Lebanese state against any Israeli aggression. 
The resistance can live with social peace. It is even a 
prerequisite of that peace. 
  Nasrallah does not expect Israel to achieve what it wants 
from al-Dirani's kidnapping, because "Ron Arad's" issue has 
become like a riddle. "We dealt with the issue very seriously 
because it is part of a process that can help release all POW's 
and detainees in Israeli jails. Hajj Mustafa cooperated 
seriously with us. He knows the declared and circulated 
information on the issue to an extent, after which neither we 
nor him know anything of the issue. That is why I can swear 
that the Israelis will reach a dead end with him (Abu-'Ali 
al-Dirani)." 
  The Hizballah secretary general affirmed that the party has 
not ruled out a swap. "But we do not know the party holding 
Arad; we do not even know whether he is being held by a 
particular party. Besides, Israel rejects any solution involving 
a swap unless the Israeli navigator is involved in it," he said. 
He believes that "Arad's" issue might be a mere excuse to 
target the resistance and its leaders. He expressed surprise 
that the world is interested in this issue although it ignores 
hundreds of Lebanese and thousands of Palestinians who are being 
held in the occupation's prisons.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Abu-Isbir from Ba'labakk] </F>
  [Excerpts] New information has emerged regarding the 
Israeli act of piracy represented by the abduction of al-Hajj 
Mustafa al- Dirani, one of the leaders of the Believers 
Resistance, from his home in Qasr Naba. The Israelis jammed the 
telecommunications networks in the area during the operation. 
An agent guided the two helicopters to their landing place on 
the al-Furzul-Niha hills at night. The Israeli soldiers doped 
Mustafa al-Dirani's family members so that they couldn't move or 
resist. Needle marks were found on their hands, legs, and necks. 
  Traces of blood were found a few meters from al-Dirani's 
house. It is believed an Israeli soldier was wounded during an 
exchange of fire. Israel has admitted that one Israeli officer 
was hurt during the operation. The Israelis opened fire from 
weapons equipped with silencers. The Israeli military jeeps 
stopped at a place called Wadi Shararah outside Qasr Naba. 
  The first to open fire on the Israeli force was 
'Abd-al-Karim 
al-Dirani (brother of captive Mustafa), who used a hunting rifle 
to fire on the Israeli soldiers. The Israelis used infrared 
night vision equipment. 
  The telephone line at al-Dirani's house was out of order for 
three days. The Israelis appear to have known about this 
because they did not cut the line. 
  Marks left by an axe were seen on a wooden door and there 
were three bullet marks on the outside wall of the second floor 
of the house. It seems the Israelis fired on the house to cover 
their withdrawal. 
  The israelis left behind a door-opening device, cassettes, 
al-Dirani's worry beads, and bandages, which, it seems, they 
dropped in the confusion after fire was opened on them. 
  Al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani returned to his house in Qasr Naba 
on the evening of Friday [20 May] to spend the 'Id al-Adha 
holiday with his family, relatives, and friends. This proves 
that his house was under surveillance by agents. Thus the 
circle of suspicion might narrow, possibly leading to the 
identification of the participants in the operation. [passage 
omitted covered in previously filed material] 
  Former Hizballah Secretary General Subhi al-Tufayli held a 
news conference at which he accused the Lebanese authorities of 
having prior knowledge of the operation and contributing to the 
handover of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani to Israel. He said: The 
state is held responsible because it is responsible for the 
people's security and because it storms houses, arrests people, 
and sets up gallows. 
  He declared that the state, which cannot protect its 
citizens 
from the Zionist enemy, who came by helicopters and stayed five 
hours on the ground, has no right to knock on doors and storm 
citizens' homes. It has no right to say it is responsible for 
the country's security. 
  He called on citizens to use weapons against anyone who 
knocks on their door and storms their home, regardless of his 
alleged identity or uniform, because we are facing a situation 
in which we cannot differentiate between the Zionist enemy and 
others. Every citizen must defend himself. 
  Al-Tufayil said the Israeli operation was within the 
framework of the negotiations and part of the security 
normalization process between Lebanon and the Zionist entity. 
  He said the issue of Israeli pilot Ron Arad is a riddle 
[uhjiyyah]. He pointed out: According to my confirmed 
information, Iran has no connection with this issue. And 
Hizballah--of which I was secretary general--has no connection 
with this issue. I have heard that the other parties that might 
be holding the pilot have denied any connection with or 
knowledge of the issue. If the denial is correct, as is the 
case with Hizballah and Iran, the chances are that the Israeli 
pilot has died or was killed. Based on this premise, the issue 
is now a riddle. 
  Zakariya Hamzah, also known as Abu-Yahya, one of the leaders 
of the Believers Resistance, said: We have an account to settle 
with Israel. As Abu-'Ali al-Dirani was taken, he will return. 
Our concern now is to search for the threads that led the 
Israelis to brother Mustafa al-Dirani. We will cooperate to 
confront the ferocious Israeli enemy. After the assassination 
of 'Abbas al- Musawi, the quality operations against Israel 
increased. After the abduction of Abu-'Ali, we will confront 
Israel with quality operations. This is our style. We have an 
account outstanding with the Jews, outstanding since the time of 
Khaybar. The biggest account we will settle will be with the 
agents of the enemy. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Mas'ud Khales commentary: "An Eye for an Eye"] </F>
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The recent "kidnapping" is not 
the first such act by the Zionist regime; it will possibly not 
be the last. In view of the time at which this incident took 
place, there are some important points that should be stated and 
some lessons to be learned. [passage omitted] 
  The most optimistic assessment of the silence by the West 
and 
international forums on Israel's "state terrorism" is that this 
silence stems from their confusion over the actions by the 
Zionists ruling occupied Palestine; and if their silence does 
not mean confirmation, they should prove this by their deeds. 
It seems a new opportunity has emerged for all the governments 
that are accused of terrorism to question the U.S. policy of 
double standards on terrorism. Although propounding this topic 
in international organizations will be confronted with America's 
veto as usual, it will be an effort by the accused to put forth 
a new interpretation of terrorism and its limits. [passage 
omitted] 
  With this act, the Zionist regime showed that it has not 
given up its efforts to advance its aggressive objectives under 
any condition and that world public opinion and reaction is 
worth nothing to it. If this is so, then those whose territory 
is occupied by the enemy will be entitled to reserve the right 
to set limitations aside to defend themselves and to oust the 
enemy and to choose the time and the venue for their 
confrontation with the enemy. According to Hizballah, no part 
of Lebanon is safe for the Muslims. Under such circumstances, 
rendering every area insecure for the Zionists and their mentors 
within the framework of the policy of retaliation is a just act 
that should not be protested. Any protest should be aimed at a 
usurping government that supports terrorism and attaches no 
value to public opinion.

  [Text] Palestinian organizations opposed to the bargain 
agreement between the PLO and the Zionist entity have refused to 
hand over their weapons to 'Arafat's supporters in Gaza and 
Jericho. 
  Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] 
spokesman in Damascus, said that the Palestinian police must 
first of all disarm the Zionist occupation forces. 
  He added: Any person who tries to deprive us of our right to 
confront the enemy will be killed. 
  Meanwhile a spokesman for George Habash's Popular Front for 
the Liberation of Palestine announced that the front's forces 
will not lay down their arms as long as one Zionist soldier or 
settler remains in the Gaza Strip or the West Bank. 
  A spokesman for Nayif Hawatimah's Democratic Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine also opposed disarming the Palestinian 
organizations. He said any Zionist settler or soldier seen in 
Gaza or Jericho will be killed.

  [Text] One of the leaders of Fatah in the Gaza Strip, 
Furayh Abu-Middayn, said that there are no plans at this stage 
to disarm armed groups such as the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam. 
Speaking to reporter Mark Weiss this morning, Abu-Middayn said 
the main problem is that money and equipment promised to the 
Palestinian police force has still not arrived. 
  [Begin recording] Abu-Middayn: Well, we are 
controlling very good, I am sure, but you know, communications 
and investors, all these facilities which the donors promised to 
send us -- particularly the Americans -- we did not receive it 
until now. This is a problem for security because we have no 
equipment, no sophisticated equipment for communications. We 
need cars, we need everything. There are a lot of promises, but 
nobody sends anything. This is the real problem for the 
Palestinians, but we are ready, our soldiers are there, our 
policemen are there, and everything is running like a watch. 
  Weiss: When do you think the Palestinian police 
will be able to stop attacks against Israeli soldiers? 
  Abu-Middayn: Look, as security will be within one 
week, it will be 100 percent perfect, but as you know, the real 
challenge for the Palestinians is they have not got any money 
even for next week. [sentence as heard] This is the real 
problem. 
  Weiss: When do you expect the Palestinian police 
to move to disarm groups such as 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam? 
  Abu-Middayn: You should ask Mr. 'Arafat or the 
military commanders. I have no answer for this question. 
  Weiss: So far, there are no plans to move against 
these groups? 
  Abu-Middayn: No, until now we have no plans.

  [Text] The Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip 
have detained an Islamic Jihad activist. According to Islamic 
leaders in Gaza the detainee, Hanni al-'Abd, is a journalist 
working in a local communications center which is connected with 
Islamic Jihad. Islamic Jihad people in Gaza say that Palestinian 
policemen searched for al-'Abd several days ago. Since he was 
not at home, he came voluntarily to the police headquarters in 
Gaza, where he was detained. Palestinian security elements in 
Gaza confirm that the man was detained. They refused to say 
why, but noted that he is the only person currently jailed in 
the Gaza prison.

the Palestinian security forces in the Gaza Strip yesterday. 
  Of the 70 -- who constitute the total number of Fatah's 
terrorists and fugitives -- some 30 will be incorporated into 
the Palestinian police force; approximately 20 will join the 
security service under Muhammad Dahlan's command, while the rest 
will join the military force, or will renounce this privilege 
and become civilians. 
  A senior Israeli source said the Israeli security forces 
were 
unaware of this agreement.

  [Text] The Palestinians have announced that they do not 
intend to induct into the police force Fatah Hawks and wanted 
men who are not sanctioned by Israel. Our army affairs 
correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that Brig. Gen. Yom-Tov 
Sami', the liaison with the Palestinians, sought to check 
reports that Uri Magidish's assassins had been inducted into the 
Palestinian police. He was told that Fatah Hawks had been 
concentrated in a classification camp, and that those who are 
found to be qualified to be policemen would be inducted only 
after Israel approves it. 
  Meanwhile, it has been learned that the policeman who banned 
Brig. Gen. Doron Almog from traveling freely on roads in the 
Gaza Strip has been brought to trial and sent to jail. IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] sources this morning expressed 
satisfaction about the way Palestinian police roadblocks 
checking Palestinians at the border crossings with Israel have 
been working.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 May--A fugitive terrorist was killed in 
the al-Badari district in Asyut Governorate today while running 
away from police who were trying to arrest him. 
  A responsible security source in the Interior Ministry said 
today that while the Criminal Investigation Police in the Asyut 
security directorate were setting up ambushes in the 'Arab 
Mutayr in the al-Badari district of the Asyut Governorate early 
this morning, fugitive terrorist 'Ali 'Abd-al-Rahman Salamah 
opened fire at the police and attempted to escape. The police 
fired back and killed him. 
  The source said that the police found an automatic rifle, 
three magazines with 32 rounds, and a forged identity card in 
the name of Ibrahim Isma'il Muhammad al-Timsah with a photograph 
of the terrorist in his possession. 
  The source said that the criminal investigation authorities 
are continuing their work in this area to arrest merchants and 
smugglers of weapons. The criminology laboratory went to the 
site of the incident, and the prosecution has been informed to 
begin the investigation.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ala' al-Bahhar] </F>
  [Text] The security service departments will launch 
wide-scale campaigns over the next two weeks in an attempt to 
arrest many members of the militant extremist groups. The 
security departments estimate the number of group members at 
5,000. 
  A ranking security official has told AL-SHA'B that in the 
next stage the security service will step up armed confrontation 
in Asyut. He said a timetable had been drawn up by the interior 
ministry to liquidate the leaders of the extremist groups inside 
and outside the prisons. He added that the armed confrontation 
operations will last for a while. He admitted that the security 
service has failed to properly monitor the militant elements 
within the extremist groups. 
  The official said that the interior ministry had covered up 
this failure by announcing that 98 leading extremists were 
captured even though most of them were detained arbitrarily. 
Some of the detainees now in custody of the state security 
intelligence will appear on television and in the papers and be 
repentant as former members of extremist groups. 
  The security official added that the announcement on the 
latest organization was prompted by the political leadership to 
confront the activities of the lawyers association, which is 
calling for an investigation into the killing of lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani. The interior ministry has said that 
Madani was a link between the Islamic Group's leaders inside and 
outside the prisons.

  [Text] The Islamic Group has dismissed recent charges by 
the Egyptian Human Rights Organization saying it had killed 
eight Christians in Asyut over the past four months. 
  The Islamic Group issued a statement saying that killing 
Copts is not its objective, adding that security authorities 
have always tried to raise accusations against it to conceal the 
facts and their incompetence at identifying the real criminals. 
The security authorities' objective is to distort the image of 
the Islamic Group in Egypt and abroad, it added. 
  The Islamic Group said that it is concerned with the issue 
of 
the Copts and that the Copts' rights, which were approved by 
Islam, will be respected at present and in future.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 21 May (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has affirmed that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani 
held an important position within the extremist groups. He said 
that some terrorists have confessed to the higher state security 
prosecution that the lawyer was the direct contact link to 
Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the amir of the organization. The latter 
died on 25 April 1994 in a clash with the police. 
  In statements to the Cairo-based AL-AKHBAR newspaper today, 
al-Alfi said that 'Abd-al-Harith was moving funds between the 
leaders of the organization inside the prison and those outside 
it. He was also responsible for funding the activities of the 
organization by distributing the support funds from abroad. 
  In his statements, the interior minister said the dead 
terrorist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani never entered the state 
investigations' building. Right after he was arrested, upon 
orders from the prosecution, he was taken to the hospital where 
he died from a severe asthmatic attack. The interior minister 
affirmed that the prosecution had autopsied the body and the 
coroner's report has been presented to the public prosecutor. 
[see previous Terrorism Report for items on Madani's arrest, 
death] 
  Al-Alfi noted that the events at the Lawyer's Union, which 
were orchestrated by some lawyers who belong to the disbanded 
Muslim Brotherhood group, are seen as another ring in the chain 
of confrontation between terrorism and security. He pointed out 
that these lawyers tried to cause tension among the Egyptian 
people. [passage omitted praising police]

<F P=106> [By Ramesh Vinayak, Amarnath K. Menon in Hyderabad, and Uday </F>
Mahurkar in Ahmedabad] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In mid '88 -- the post 
Operation Black Thunder period -- terrorist success, even 
against the famed National Security Guard [NSG], had become 
directly proportional to demoralisation within the state police. 
Gill decided to make commandos out of his own policemen, a 
tactic based on the simple reasoning that a properly motivated 
and trained commando force having roots in Punjab would fight 
terrorists better. 
  Drawn from the Punjab Armed Police, six companies of the 
police personnel underwent six months of training by army and 
Border Security Force [BSF] instructors, and were then deployed 
in Tarn Taran in 1989 on an experimental basis. Heartened by 
their progress against the militants, four more commando 
battalions were raised, a final moment of truth being "Operation 
Night Dominance" in late 1992 when the commandos finally pushed 
the terrorists to the wall. 
  All doubts about the efficacy of this brainchild were erased 
by the figures: till January 31 last year, the commandos were 
involved in 117 encounters in which 222 terrorists were killed, 
including 56 hardcore ones, and 283 weapons seized. Only 14 
commandos were killed in the anti-terrorist drive since 1989 as 
against more than 1,300 police casualties during this period. 
Today, Punjab has a 10,482-strong commando contingent, the 
biggest in the country, and as IG [Inspector General] 
(Commandos) P. Lal says: "They are the finest fighting machine." 
  The repercussions of this success story were immediate. The 
Assam Government, for example, requisitioned two battalions from 
the Punjab Police to deal with ULFA [United Liberation Front of 
Assam] insurgents, and even sent down a batch of 90 Assam Police 
officers for commando training in Punjab. 
  Training depends on each state's requirement, whether it be 
urban terrorism in Bombay or guerrilla warfare in the jungles of 
Andhra Pradesh. Commando tactics, parajumping, defensive 
driving, rock climbing, sniper training and field survival 
techniques, once absent from the policeman's dictionary are now 
an intrinsic part of his vocabulary. Physical and written tests 
are de rigueur, and equally common are psychologists in the 
state selection panels. Every sort of terrorist situation is 
simulated and Andhra Pradesh's Special Security Force (SSF) 
commandos are forced to understand and undergo the same rigours 
of a militant by spending a week in the jungle without food or 
water. Not surprisingly the drop out rate is steep. In Punjab 
about 25 per cent while at the Special Security Group of Tamil 
Nadu (SSG), of the 6,000 officers and constables initially 
selected, not more than 200 will eventually make the grade. 
  With training comes weaponry. Standard weapons now include 
automatic assault rifles and 9 mm pistols. Tamil Nadu has 
imported 50 MP-5 rifles -- a close-quarter battle rifle -- and 
70 fibre glass Glock pistols at a cost of Rs 50 lakh. The SSG 
is the only elite force equipped with imported Motorola 
communication systems. The Punjab commandos have 51 mm mortar 
and will soon have 450 imported sniper rifles. 
  Yet, despite every effort, shortcomings in some states 
remain. Incentives are often not enough and facilities and 
equipment not always available and affordable. Although some 
units, like the Special Operations Squad (SOS) in Maharashtra 
get 50 per cent more pay than their counterparts, a special 
clothing allowance and injury compensation, it is not always the 
case. The West Bengal commando draws the same salary as any 
other policeman there, forcing a top police official to remark: 
"In the absence of special incentives, motivation to become 
commandos is lacking among our police ranks." In Delhi 
sub-inspectors get Rs [rupees] 100 extra and a special diet 
allowance of Rs 4 a day. 
  Funds are a source of worry too. West Bengal's commando unit 
is floundering because of lack of resources. In Haryana the 
situation has necessitated some improvisation. The commandos 
there are using a railway bridge on a canal as a water obstacle 
course. And in Madhya Pradesh, a police officer admits that "if 
we get the guns we don't get the ammunition." There is also the 
question over their role, for there are states where the 
commando has become a glorified bodyguard, in danger of becoming 
a footman for every VIP with a security paranoia. 
  Yet, commando operations in some states are advancing 
rapidly. Haryana has set up a 40-acre commando complex near 
Karnal which cost Rs 3 crore while the SSG has an exclusive 100 
acre shooting range for reflex shooting training. 
  Punjab, which has constantly set the pace, is as usual ahead 
of others. The police will shortly set up a computerised combat 
shooting range at a cost of Rs 1 crore, a facility which only 
the NSG has. Also being acquired are an Infantry Weapons Effect 
Simulator System whereby an actual combat situation can be 
simulated, and a Small Arms Training System to sharpen shooting 
ability, both of which will cost Rs 23 lakh. Also in the 
pipeline is a Rs 80 lakh water obstacle course and the purchase 
of 270 sighting telescopes. 
  A creditable spinoff in raising crack outfits has been that 
it has ushered in a commando culture within police forces. The 
basic purpose is to upgrade the policing without involving elite 
commandos in normal law and order problems. In Punjab, about 
4,500 policemen have been given commando training and they are 
called district commandos. The SSG has trained more than 8,000 
inspectors and sub- inspectors in batches so far and the Gujarat 
commandos have trained more than 400 policemen from districts. 
The SSF has raised a smaller commando unit -- City Guards -- to 
check terrorist activities in Hyderabad. 
  The message is clear. India's police force, a target for 
taunts, will no longer turn their untrained backs on crises any 
more. In a nation where so many areas are torn by internal and 
external strife, the police commando has emerged to play a 
significant role. Says Haryana DGP, Kalyan Rudra: "The 
emerging complex security scenario requires the police forces to 
acquire deterrent teeth." They have, and they are ready to bite.

<F P=106> [Article by Tilak K. Gupta: "Major Naxal Groups Forge Unity"] </F>
  [Text] Patna, March 21--In a significant development, the 
Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), and the CPI M-L [Communist Party 
of India-Marxist-Leninist (Party Unity), two of the most 
militant Naxalite organisations in Bihar, have joined hands with 
the powerful CPI M-L (People's War) group of Andhra Pradesh to 
float the All India People's Resistance Forum (AIPRF). The 
Maharashtra state unit of the CPI M-L (People's War) has also 
become a constituent of the AIPRF. 
  While all these Naxalite groups function underground and 
operate in a clandestine manner, they have over the years built 
open and legal mass organisations for the peasant, workers, 
student and youth as well as women fronts under various names. 
The AIPRF, is scheduled to be the apex co-ordinating body of 
more than 50 such frontal organisations active in different 
states. 
  The CPI M-L (People's War), for instance, has built a 
variety 
of mass organisations in parts of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, 
Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Karnataka. The MCC, on the other 
hand, has a number of mass organisations in Bihar, West Bengal 
and claims to have some influence also in Assam, Tripura and 
Uttar Pradesh. The CPI M-L (Party Unity), reportedly, has a 
substantial presence in the coastal parts of Andhra Pradesh, 
West Bengal, Punjab and Delhi, apart from its bases in the 
South-Central Bihar. 
  The Rayatu Koolie Sangha, the frontal organisations of 
agricultural labourers and peasants in Andhra Pradesh built by 
the People's War group, inform AIPRF sources, enjoys membership 
in lakhs. In Bihar, the now-banned Majdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti 
(MKSS), agree most observers, has a substantial following. The 
MCC, on the other hand, has floated a semi-legal mass 
organisation, "Krantikari Kisan Committee," in the rural parts 
of Bihar. 
  The AIPRF, according to inside sources, has been built to 
pave the way for a concerted initiative to co-ordinate the local 
struggles of its constituent bodies and give it an all-India 
character. This apex body of the major Naxalite organisations, 
is scheduled to hold a conference at Calcutta on March 21, to 
give final shape to its manifesto. On the following day, the 
AIPRF plans to hold a massive rally at Calcutta to give a 
glimpse of the strength of the militant peasant struggles being 
waged under their leadership in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and the 
forest areas of Dandakaranya. 
  The draft manifesto of the AIPRF, presently, in circulation 
among its constituents, states that its main objective is to 
"build and develop powerful anti-feudal and anti-imperialist 
struggles towards the goal of a new democratic India." But most 
probably, this new platform would be utilised by the underground 
Naxalite groups to articulate its views on major political 
issues before a larger national audience. 
  Moreover, as the draft manifesto indicates, the AIPRF seems 
to be desirous of forging a common front with diverse on-going 
movements to defend the rights of tribals, Dalits, women and for 
the protection of environment waged by various non-Maoist 
formations. Interestingly, the movement against the Sardar 
Sarovar Dam, more commonly known as "Narmada bachao andolan," 
has been singled out for special mention in this connection. 
  The growing opposition to the recently-concluded GATT 
[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] treaty among various 
sections of the Indian population also seems to have encouraged 
these Naxalite organisations to search for a larger arena for 
united struggle. No wonder, the draft manifesto of AIPRF, puts 
stress on building united struggle with all those forces opposed 
to the Dunkel draft. The draft, however, at the same time, terms 
the opposition of Janata Dal, CPI [Communist Party of India] and 
CPM [Communist Party of India-Marxist] to the Dunkel draft, as 
only "nominal," and thus perhaps, excludes them from the purview 
of joint action. 
  Asked to differentiate itself from the IPF [Indian People's 
Front (leftist group)], and affiliate of the CPI M-L [Communist 
Party of India-Marxist-Leninist] (Liberation), the AIPRF sources 
point out that whereas IPF is an electoral outfit, the new 
organisation will have no truck with parliamentary politics. It 
may be noted that the CPI M-L (People's War), MCC and CPI M-L 
(Party Unity), in fact, boycott elections.

  [Text] Jammu, April 17--Pakistani agencies have issued 
fresh directions to some militant outfits and their agents 
operating in Jammu and Kashmir to kill India's political 
leaders, according to top official sources, reports PTI. 
  The sources said, that recently intercepted radio messages 
from across the border revealed that major contacts within the 
state have been told to attack political leaders wherever 
possible. 
  This, the sources said, was being done to thwart the 
initiation of political process and subsequent elections in 
Jammu and Kashmir. 
  The major targets, according to these messages, were the top 
leaders of the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference and of the 
pradesh Congress committee. 
  However, leaders from the Janata Dal and CPM [Communist 
Party 
of India] were also placed high on the target lists. 
  One message intercepted during the recent Jammu tour of the 
Union minister of state for internal security, Mr Rajesh Pilot, 
had asked its contacts to do "anything" to eliminate the 
visiting dignatary. 
  In view of these threats, most of the political 
personalities 
in the state, including those in the Jammu region, have been 
provided with a tight security cover in the form of armed guards 
at their residences. More than 2,000 police personnel were 
deployed for security cover duty in the state. 
  There were about 550 to 600 politicians and other political 
activists who had migrated from Kashmir to Jammu and Delhi after 
several political leaders and former legislators were killed in 
the Valley. 
  The militants recently gunned down Mr Wali Mohammed Itto, 
the 
former speaker of the J and K assembly and Mr Ghulam Qadir Mir, 
a former independent MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and 
close lieutenant of Sheikh Abdullah. 
  While Mr. Itto was killed outside a mosque after offering 
prayers in Khati-ka-Talab area of Jammu on March 18, Mr. Mir was 
shot dead in his house at Muran village of Pulwama district in 
Kashmir valley on April 9.

there was a sharp increase in attempted attacks with live 
ammunition against IDF [Israel Defense Forces] installations set 
up in the Qatif Bloc and against IDF patrols. The sources

  [Text] The commander of the Central Command decided to 
extend the administrative detention of Kakh activists No'am 
Federman and Ben-Tziyon Gubstein by another three months, our 
correspondent Aviv Bushinsky has learned. The two were 
scheduled to be released in two days, but the Hasharon prison 
authorities received an order to remand them in custody. Our 
correspondent has learned that both the detainees and the police 
were surprised by the news, and the detainees intend to appeal 
it. 
  The High Court of Justice rejected the appeal of Gil'on Ben- 
Sa'id, a Qiryat Arba' settler and a major in the reserves, whose 
weapon was confiscated after the massacre in Hebron. Our 
correspondent Mira Amsalem reports that the judges ruled that 
the commander of the Central Command's decision to confiscate 
his weapon was appropriate and was based on reliable information 
whereby Ben-Sa'id had previously been involved in violent 
activities. Our correspondent points out that a restraining 
order has been in effect against Ben-Sa'id banning him from the 
boundaries of Hebron.

  [Text] The security forces have completed an operation in 
Hebron aimed at apprehending armed Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] fugitives. Two terrorists were detained, and the body 
of another terrorist was discovered under the debris of a house 
which was demolished. The security forces are searching for the 
body of another terrorist. An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] force 
is searching the area in a bid to locate more fugitives. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports that during the operation shots 
were fired at an IDF force from a nearby cave; the soldiers 
returned the fire. The entire area is closed-off to traffic. 
The operation was launched in a bid to apprehend fugitives who 
are suspected of murdering the settlers near Bet Hagay last 
week. [see item TA1705072694 in previous Terrorism Report]

the Liberation of Palestine [munazzamat jaysh al-thawrah 
al-islamiyah li tahrir filastin] has claimed responsibility for 
the operation it carried out against the Zionist occupation 
forces in the Rshaf area in the occupied zone of southern 
Lebanon on Saturday [14 May]. In a statement, the organization 
said its Gaza Fedayeen group penetrated the Zionist enemy's 
front in Rshaf, killing and wounding a number of Zionist 
soldiers. 
  Following this heroic operation, the Zionist enemy forces 
shelled the liberated areas adjacent to the occupied zone in 
southern Lebanon with mortar and artillery.

<F P=106> [Interview with Libyan leader Col. Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Tripoli; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH: What is 
preoccupying you most these days? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: At the national level, we are 
preoccupied with the current confrontation between a small 
country and a small people, that is, the Libyan people, and 
three major states, all of which are nuclear and Christian 
states. Libya is a Muslim state and they are imperialist states 
which have the right of veto (in the Security Council). And 
they have atomic bombs. Of course, we cannot ignore the fact 
that we are very busy with the confrontation with three 
oppressive, arrogant, insolent, and tyrannical states. [passage 
omitted] 
  At the international level, we are preoccupied with that 
international arrogance and that insolence. Because the world 
has turned into a jungle. But we are certain that the small 
animals in the jungle will fight with their claws and teeth -- 
which means that the jungle will drown in blood because of what 
imperialism is doing. [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH: What about Algeria? Is it not 
preoccupying you? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, regrettably, France is 
currently taking revenge against Algeria. France and the United 
States are behind all that is happening in Algeria. France is 
backed primarily by the United States and the Israelis. The 
Mossad, French intelligence, and the CIA are involved in the 
murder, financing, training, and armament operations, so that 
Algeria would pay the price for its independence and rebellion 
against France. That is what is happening in Algeria. 
  AL-HAYAH: How can you help Algeria? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, that is a worry.... If the 
aggression was foreign, the matter would have been clear. But 
as long as the Algerians are fighting one another inside the 
country, no one can do anything except offering advice and kind 
words. They [not further identified] are also trying to get 
Egypt to pay the price for its war against the Israelis, the 
'Abd-al-Nasir era, the nationalization of the Suez Canal, and 
its leadership of the Arab nation. Egypt is paying the price 
for that, because the Americans, the West, and the Israelis 
consider Egypt the archenemy. The Israelis want to destroy 
Egypt. There is a truce between Egypt and Israel, not peace. 
They want to exploit this truce to destroy Egypt so that it 
will be under Israel's heel. 
  AL-HAYAH: With regard to the Libyan issue and the 
blockade imposed on it, how do you view the possibility of 
finding a solution or a way out, and do you believe that is 
possible? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: If the issue is to do with 
Lockerbie, there are solutions proposed which are very feasible 
and which will save face for all the parties. But if the 
Western states have another objective, then the attempts are 
improper and we would be facing a state of colonialism and 
insolence. And thus we should prepare ourselves for a 
confrontation and a war which the enemy should lose or not win. 
If the issue is to do with Lockerbie, it can be resolved easily 
in accordance with the formulas being proposed. All 
international organizations and the world as a whole support 
Libya. The three states are isolated, exposed, and lack even a 
fig leaf to cover their nakedness before the world with regard 
to the Lockerbie issue and the Libyan position. If their 
objective is colonialist, then in this case we are facing a new 
colonialist attempt and we will fight. 
  AL-HAYAH: With regard to the proposed solutions, 
is there anything new and practical? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: Of course, there is a proposal from 
the Arab League and from international jurists, namely that a 
Scottish court be sent to another country -- The Hague, for 
example. And that the two suspects be handed over to the Arab 
League and then to this court under agreed UN guarantees. This 
is the latest solution we have heard. It is not a Libyan 
solution or a Libyan proposal. It is a proposal made by 
international jurists, espoused by the Arab League, and 
supported by the world as a whole. 
  AL-HAYAH: What is the fate of all the weapons in 
your possession? Can you look after and service them? You 
purchased large quantities of weapons.... 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: It has become clear that we were 
not wrong when we purchased and stockpiled the weapons. Time 
has shown that Libya is a target for aggression. One day 
al-Sadat was against us, Bourguiba was against us, al-Numayri 
was against us, and Hissein Habre was against us. France and 
the United States fought alongside them in Chad and Egypt. And 
Niger's Kountche was against us, and U.S. fleets threatened us 
from the sea. And we were attacked in 1986 by the two biggest 
states in the world, that is the United States and Britain. Our 
children were killed while asleep in their homes. It has become 
clear that we were right when we purchased the weapons and that 
we were targeted by an oppressive and direct aggression, and 
that we were entitled to have weapons to defend ourselves. The 
biggest danger threatening us now is the Israelis' possession of 
atomic bombs and nuclear missiles with a 4,000-mile range aimed 
against Libya, North Africa, Sudan, and the other Arab states. 
It is a very serious matter. Israel has atomic weapons, and 
the United States and the West are refusing to talk to the 
Israelis about them or to deprive them of this weapon. While 
the United States continues to pursue Libya, Korea, Iran, and 
Pakistan. As for the Israelis, they are exempt from the 
pursuit, punishment, and questioning. They are above 
international law. They are above Chapter VII of the UN Charter. 
If the Security Council decides a punishment for Israel, the 
United States uses its right of veto. Actually we are faced 
with a very serious situation: An adversary state is exempt 
from punishment and from Chapter VII of the UN Charter, is above 
international law, and is entitled to own any weapon of mass 
destruction, and no one questions it about anything. They 
pursued us because of a pharmaceutical plant until they 
ascertained it was a pharmaceutical plant. Why do they not 
pursue the Israelis, who admit their possession of atomic bombs 
and who have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty? 
  AL-HAYAH: You have helped numerous allies since 
the revolution erupted. Who is now with you, who has turned 
against you, and who has been able to help you during the 
blockade period? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: By God, all those we helped support 
us, each according to his ability. We helped numerous forces in 
the world. We helped people who are now presidents of republics 
and heads of state. The West used to say that these are 
terrorist camps. These terrorist camps have turned into heads 
of state and regular armies, like Museveni and Sam Nujoma in 
Namibia, or the presidents of Congo, Angola, and Mozambique... 
all of them had their camps in Libya. They [the West] used to 
call them terrorists. [passage omitted] 
  AL-HAYAH: A final question regarding those 
describing themselves as oppositionists abroad: What would you 
say to them? 
  Al-Qadhdhafi: I say that with the establishment 
of people's power, there is no room for opposition. Oppose 
whom? The Libyan people? So you are opposing your people and 
homeland. In that case, the person becomes a stray dog. That 
person is a stray dog when he opposes his people and his 
homeland. [passage omitted] There is no possibility of 
opposition at all. If there are Libyans abroad, they are 
miserable. Most of them are businessmen. A large number of 
them returned, carrying catalogs and business contacts from 
which we have benefited. They enter and leave the country after 
they realized that matters are different. They laughed at the 
conditions they had been in. Even people who used to attack us 
over the radio came and laughed at their previous conditions, 
admitting they had been miserable and their statements were 
unreasonable. They told us: Forgive us, and indeed we did when 
they entered the country... Anyone who wants to return can 
return, and anyone who repents is forgiven. God accepts 
repentance, so shouldn't human beings do the same? Anyone who 
repents enters the country safely. As for anyone who does not 
repent, his only option is to become an agent for foreign 
intelligence, and this is what has happened. One escaped after 
stealing the people's money and another escaped to avoid 
military service and national service.... These cases do not 
represent opposition. Opposition takes place when there is 
colonialism in the country, when there is dictatorship or 
exploitation.... This is opposition. But when the people have 
the power, foreigners expelled, and the homeland and the people 
are free, what do you call those who escaped? Miserable. They 
are informers for U.S. intelligence. They say things against 
their own people and their own homeland, like hit Libya, boycott 
Libyan oil, or attack Libya. What does this incitement mean? It 
means that intelligence services tell them: say this. So they 
say it. They do not even merit a question being put about them.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Maximise U.S. Terrorism Report"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Those who have faulted President D.B. Wijetunga 
for his references to the terrorist problem that Sri Lanka faces 
in the north will be well advised to study the U.S. State 
Department's latest annual terrorism report which has in clear 
unambiguous language described the Liberation Tigers of Tamil 
Eelam (LTTE) to be what they are -- a terrorist organisation 
which stops at nothing. 
  While it is gratifying that countries like the United States 
of America are exposing the Tigers in official publications, 
identifying their front organisations and presenting 
authoritative information on the LTTE's far-flung networks, we 
cannot escape the reality that the LTTE is still able to 
continue maintaining offices in many western countries and pour 
their propaganda into receptive ears. 
  The question we must ask ourselves is whether our diplomatic 
and security apparatus is strong enough to seize opportunities 
such as the publication of the State Department's terrorism 
report and ensure that the Tigers are driven out of some of 
their lairs in Europe and North America. It is essential that 
Colombo lobbies the various concerned governments to ensure that 
the LTTE finds themselves less comfortable in some of the cities 
where they have entrenched themselves. 
  Much of what appears in the U.S. report is not new. It has 
been fairly well known that the Tigers use both overt and 
illegal methods for their weapons procuring and fund raising; 
that they are into drug trafficking in Europe; that they have 
also set up a finely orchestrated propaganda machine to suggest 
that the Tamils in Sri Lanka are a besieged people. The fact is 
that those Tamils who are besieged are those living in areas 
under LTTE control. That is why tens of thousands of people 
living in the Jaffna peninsula want to get out of there if they 
possibly can. 
  While many governments are well aware that the Tigers extort 
contributions from Tamils working in their countries, very 
little has been done to stop such activity. The LTTE, no doubt, 
is able to ensure that there are no complaints. It will be a 
brave man or woman who would dare blow the whistle on the Tigers 
anywhere. But with some effort Colombo will be able to persuade 
the concerned governments to at least ensure that asylum 
applications of people known to be engaging in illegal 
activities are not sympathetically considered. 
  This is why it is essential that our foreign missions are 
properly staffed with trained and effective diplomats. [passage 
omitted] It is essential that all our missions work hard at 
making life as uncomfortable as possible for Tigers abroad by 
turning the heat on wherever possible. They must, among other 
things, develop contacts with the security agencies of the host 
countries and keep tabs on arms buying and other activities of 
the LTTE. 
  We do not know how much our missions abroad are assisting 
the 
security effort at home. We hope that a useful input from 
Colombo was available to the authors of the U.S. terrorism 
report and that this publication will be used to maximum 
advantage in all countries in which Colombo maintains diplomatic 
representation. 
  The war against the LTTE cannot be fought only on the battle 
field. It has to be fought on many fronts and with different 
kinds of ammunition. Washington's latest report has provided 
several opportunities which must be seized. It is significant 
that the American government has branded the Tigers to be behind 
many killings, including those of Rajiv Gandhi, Ranasinghe 
Premadasa and Lalith Athulathmudali that the LTTE has denied. 
This must be noted by our own people in the context of various 
uninformed allegations that we hear in Sri Lanka itself.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Four unidentified terrorists 
seized some 30 hostages in a bus near the city of Mineralnye 
Vody in northern Caucasus on Thursday. 
  According to the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations, 
they are armed with three submachine guns and a grenade. The 
terrorists demand drugs, a helicopter without a crew, 10 million 
U.S. dollars, four submachine guns, four flack jackets, a 
grenade launcher and a night sight. 
  The "Ikarus" coach was en route from Vladikavkaz in North 
Ossetia to Stavropol in southern Russia.

  [Text] Any unexpected actions or movements by the 
terrorists who seized the bus carrying passengers could also 
affect Stavropol Kray's neighbour, Krasnodar Kray, as was the 
case very recently during similar events in Rostov. The 
Krasnodar Kray militia has therefore been placed on full combat 
readiness, an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the kray 
interior affairs directorate. 
  A telephone conference was held with chiefs from town and 
rayon militia departments, which also is heightening the 
readiness of personnel in case there were unexpected 
developments in the operational situation. 
  Preparations were made for a helicopter carrying special 
purpose subunits to fly to Mineralnyye Vodiy, but its departure 
was postponed after special purpose troops from Moscow arrived 
there.

  [Text] Mineralnyye Vody (Stavropol Kray), 27 May -- As a 
result of negotiations held during the night, $4 million were 
handed over to the terrorists who had seized the bus with over 
30 passengers near Mineralnyye Vody yesterday at about noon. 
Having received the money, the terrorists released four more 
hostages but they are still insisting that the sum of $10 
million be delivered to them. 
  The four terrorists spent last night in the bus with tightly 
closed doors on the territory of the Mineralnyye Vody airport. 
They are holding 14 people hostage. 
  It is thought that early in the morning the terrorists took 
turns taking naps while keepng a close eye on the hostages and 
making sure that no one could approach the bus.

  [Excerpt] Mineralniye Vody, May 27 (ITAR-TASS) -- The four 
gunmen, who hijacked a bus with 26 people in the North Caucasus 
on Thursday, flew off in a helicopter provided by Russian 
authorities on Friday after a night of negotiations, carrying 
away with them three women, two men and the bus driver to an 
unknown destination. A crew of three is piloting the helicopter. 
  "It looks as if it could be Makhachkala," an Interior 
Ministry official said. The helicopter is being accompanied by 
seven military helicopters which keep at a distance from the 
hijackers. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Radio Moldova has reported that yesterday there was 
a powerful explosion in a building in the center of Tiraspol. 
Citing a communique released by the press center of the 
ministry of security [of the Dniester republic] which had been 
broadcast by Radio Tiraspol, Radio Moldova announced that the 
targets of the terrorist attack were the prosecutor of the 
self-proclaimed Dniester republic, Boris Luchik, his wife, and 
two of his bodyguards. 
  According to unofficial information, one of the bodyguards 
died, while the health of Luchik's wife is critical. 
  After first describing the explosion as a terrorist act 
intended to destabilize the political situation in the Dniester 
region, the communique released today by the ministry of 
security asserts that Luchik had received repeated anonymous 
telephone threats. According to the same sources, the 
prosecutor of the self-proclaimed Dniester republic has 
initiated criminal proceedings against Col. Bergman [General 
Mikhail Bergman, chief of staff of the Dniester separatist 
forces] and now the latter seems to be trying to settle accounts 
with Luchik.

  [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- Immediately after 
the explosion of a bomb in Boris Luchik's apartment he and one 
of his bodyguards were hospitalized at the Centre of Burns from 
Odessa. In the attempt Luchik received burns covering 60 
percent of his body, his bodyguard 75 percent. Boris Luchik's 
wife, Valentina died just after the explosion. Tiraspol 
officials gave the opinion on the local radio that the attempt 
on the prosecutor's life was advantageous for Col. Bergman, 
commander of the military division, who was earlier under 
investigation. The commander of the 14th Army declared that the 
attempt was probably organized by Vadim Shevtsov (Antyufeyev), 
as the Dniester prosecutor had authorized the arrest of 
Limanskiy, ex-deputy chairman of the Slobozia District Soviet.

secretary of the editorial board of the Tajik newspaper 
"DZHUMKHURIAT," was shot dead early on Thursday near his home, 
ITAR-TASS learnt from competent sources. 
  A criminal case has been opened over the fact of the 
assassination. The motives of the crime are yet to be 
investigated. However, criminal or political mafia, against 
which the reporter came out in his publications, are not ruled 
out. 
  A wave of assassinations has swept the republic recently. 
Olim Abulov, an employee of the National Broadcasting Company, 
was riddled dead from a machine gun on May 17. Vladimir Nirma, 
head of the joint U.S.-Tajik enterprise "Interfer," was also 
shot dead from a machine gun on May 18.

  [Text] Stuttgart/Karlsruhe (DPA) -- Already at the 
beginning of May, what are probably 60 grams of plutonium 239 
were seized by police during the search of an apartment in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. For several weeks the authorities in 
southwest Germany obviously did not have any idea of how 
dangerous this find was. Only on Thursday [27 May] did 
investigations by the Land Office for Environmental Protection 
in Karlsruhe show that the material, which is in a small 
cylindrical container, is probably this kind of plutonium, the 
Environment Ministry in Stuttgart announced. 
  According to the Ministry, the amount seized is "highly 
dangerous" and is the so-far largest amount found in 
Baden-Wuerttemberg. However, the amount is not sufficient for 
producing a a nuclear bomb. The material probably comes from an 
Eastern European country. The Stuttgart land Office of Criminal 
Investigations has taken over investigations. 
  Information about the occasion, the place, and the exact 
date 
of the search was not given for "tactical reasons." In 
addition, the Ministry announced that "following initial 
suspicion, the local fire brigade did not register any 
radioactive radiation outside the container."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "No All-Clear Sounding"] </F>
  [Text] The good news first: In 1993, the number of arson 
and bomb attacks fell by 41 percent compared to the previous 
year. Nevertheless, the figures that have been now released by 
the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations [BKA] are anything 
but comforting. In a confidential study, the Wiesbaden-based 
BKA talks of a reduction "on a high level." 
  With 540 politically motivated attacks, 1993 was once again 
closer to the figures for 1991 (537 attacks) following the 
horrific year 1992 (901 attacks). A return to the reasonable 
levels of 1990, which saw "only" 128 violent attacks of this 
kind cannot be expected for the time being, say the 
criminologists. 
  The most serious crimes were committed by right-wing and 
left-wing extremists: On 29 May 1993, four young neo-Nazis set 
fire to the home of a large Turkish family in Solingen, causing 
two deaths and serious injuries to eight of the occupants. Two 
months before that, early in the morning of 27 March, the new 
Hesse prison in Wieterstadt, which cost 130 million German marks 
to build, was blown up by members of the RAF [Red Army Faction]. 
  According to BKA findings, extremist right-wing motives 
(both 
acts aimed directly at left-wing groupings and various acts 
involving hostility toward foreigners) were behind 300 of the 
540 attacks. This means that attacks carried out by right-wing 
extremists reman the main problem. 
  The extremist left carried out 150 arson and bomb attacks. 
Their targets were political opponents, the police, the state, 
and the bourgeoisie. 
  The left-wing arsonists stronghold is Berlin. In the capital 
city alone, "anti-fascists" and "anti-capitalists" carried out 
69 attacks as part of campaigns, such as that directed against 
"Olympia 2000." The BKA has identified a further large group of 
arsonists and bombers among radical foreigners. 
  Of the 90 attacks carried out in 1993 by radical foreigners, 
the majority can be attributed to Kurds linked to the PKK 
[Workers Party of Kurdistan]. The potential for "politically 
motivated crimes committed by foreigners" remained the same as 
in 1992. 
  There was a significant decline in the number of criminal 
acts motivated by animosity toward foreigners. In new laender 
above all, the number of attacks fell by 75 percent. 
  The greatest praise was earned by the Thuringians, who were 
the most peaceful, followed by Saarland and Bavaria.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "10 Tons of T-4 Explosive Missing, </F>
Mafia Links Sought"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Chieti, May 19 -- About 10 tons of T-4 
explosive, the same used in three car bombings attributed to 
Cosa Nostra, have disappeared from the deposit of an explosives 
manufacturer in Casalbordino, near this central Italian town, 
police announced Thursday [19 May]. 
  Two former executives of the plant have been arrested on 
charges of unlawful possession of explosives, police added. 
  The T-4 explosives, used to make mines, were deposited at 
the 
plant by the Brescia-based manufacturer, Valsella, in 1985. 
  The National Anti-Mafia Directorate is investigating to 
determine possible connections with the three car bombings, 
which include the May 1992 assassination of judge Giovanni 
Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards in Palermo, Sicily. The 
same explosive was used in the May 14 and July 27 1993 bombings 
in Rome and Milan, respectively. Ten people were injured in the 
Rome explosion, five were killed and 12 injured in Milan.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Mexican Government Secretary Jorge </F>
Carpizo by Jacobo Zabludovsky; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Zabludovsky: A few 
moments ago this program reported that the Spanish justice 
minister, Juan Alberto Belloch, suspects that there are ETA 
[Basque Fatherland and Liberty] people in Mexico. A deputy of 
the opposition Spanish Popular Party, who says he has clues 
regarding the presence of ETA members in Mexico, also has this 
suspicion. Would you tell us about that? 
  Carpizo: Of course, several Spanish media have 
reported this for several months, and some Mexican media have 
echoed the story. Undoubtedly there are people in our country 
who come from Spain, who come from that part of the Basque 
region, but we do not have any evidence that there are any 
guerrillas. If we had proof -- this is being investigated and 
we will continue to investigate it -- Mexico would act according 
to the law. 
  Zabludovsky: Thank you very much Dr. Carpizo. 
  Carpizo: Thank you very much for giving me this 
opportunity to be with you again.

  [Text] Seven terrorists were killed in clashes with 
security forces in Batman's Beseri and Siirt's Kurtalan and 
Baykan Districts and on Gabar Mountain near Sirnak. Four 
terrorists, one of them a foreigner, surrendered to the security 
forces in a bid to benefit from the repentance law. 
  Sixteen members of the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] organization, who were trained in Greece in 
explosives and sabotage actions and who were planning to 
undertake actions in tourist centers in the Aegean region, were 
captured in Izmir along with their weapons. The terrorists 
arrived in Turkey from Greece aboard boats. The three boats 
they used, one of them a speedboat, were confiscated. 
  The separatist organization's foreign courier and its 
regional leader are among those caught as a result of a series 
of operations conducted by the Izmir Security Directorate 
antiterror units. In their interrogation, the terrorists 
confessed that they were trained in explosives and sabotage at a 
PKK camp in Greece. It was said that they were caught at a time 
when they were awaiting orders to begin actions in order to 
undermine Turkish tourism. Noting that they provided personnel 
for the terrorist organization's cadres in the mountains, the 
terrorists explained that they conducted work in Izmir's 
Yamanlar Mountain for a camp to be used temporarily for entering 
and leaving the country. Searches conducted of the terrorists' 
houses and of their persons yielded one Kalashnikov automatic 
rifle, two pistols, magazines and ammunition for these weapons, 
two sticks of dynamite, and large quantities of documents and 
action plans. The 16 terrorists were referred to the Izmir 
State Security Court.

<F P=106> [Report by Ugur Sefkat: "Alliance Between the PKK and </F>
Armenians"] 
  [Text] Ankara--Concrete documents have been compiled on the 
"cooperation between the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] and the 
Armenians." The Turkish Government has known of the cooperation 
between the PKK and the Armenians for many years. But the issue 
was consistently denied by circles supporting that organization. 
  It has been established that PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan 
received funds and arms from Armenia through Armenian priests in 
Lebanon. Ocalan's links with the Armenian priests have been 
documented with photographs. The intelligence units have tried 
to document the cooperation between the PKK and the Armenians 
for years. They had an opportunity to do so in Bar Ilyas in the 
al-Biqa' valley on Tuesday 3 May. The intelligence units 
established that the priests of the Gregorian Church in Lebanon 
frequently call on Ocalan, who occasionally travels from Syria 
to the small town in the al-Biqa' valley. They took action and 
documented the most recent meeting between him and the Armenian 
priests by taking their photographs. Ocalan, considering that he 
is no longer comfortable in Syria or Lebanon, conferred with his 
guests on the possibility of moving to Armenia. The extremist 
Dachnak Party in Armenia has occasionally provided the PKK with 
funds and arms through the Armenian priests in Lebanon. 
  Most Armenians are affiliated with the Gregorian Church, 
which has close links with the Orthodox faith. Its patriarch 
lives in Echmiadzin, which is near Yerevan. The Armenians in 
Lebanon have very strong links with Echmiadzin. The church in 
Echmiadzin has significant influence with the Armenian 
Government. 
  Armenians reportedly make up a third of the PKK's 
4,000-member mountain cadre and the Armenians in Syria play an 
effective role in the organization. The commanders of the PKK's 
mountain cadres are Armenian. Officials have said that this has 
been confirmed by the many uncircumcised militants the security 
forces have discovered among the PKK members killed or captured 
in operations. 
<H5>  Orders To Kill Sakik </H5>
  The recent blows the security forces have dealt the PKK have 
created confusion among the leading members of the organization. 
PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan has instructed his militants to kill 
Muslum Durgun, alias Doctor Baran, and Semdin Sakik, alias 
Parmaksiz Zeki. Both were among the most important members of 
the PKK. Sakik was the provincial commander of what the PKK 
calls Amed Province. He has been living in a camp in Danbak, 
north of Maku in Iran, since 5 April. Ocalan ordered his 
militants to kill Sakik because he criticized his decisions. 
Regarding Sakik's case, Ocalan reportedly instructed Cemil 
Bayik, commander of the PKK Kurdish People's Liberation Army, as 
follows: "Sakik has adopted a defeatist approach. He will pay 
for it with his head. Put him before a firing squad." 
  It was Sakik who ordered a group of PKK militants to kill 33 
unarmed soldiers in Bingol Province in 1993. But his remarks to 
a group of leading PKK members in the camp in Danbak on 8 May 
prompted Ocalan to order his militants to kill him. Sakik 
reportedly said: "Insensitive parasites who have a lust for 
luxury are as dangerous as the enemy. The cause cannot be 
maintained with leaders who fail to establish the enemy's 
tactics in the war and who are unable to give accurate and 
effective instructions. A wounded man cannot see the outcome of 
an action. It is a virtue to decide to withdraw."

  [Text] The route suffered by the PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party] at the hands of the security forces in recent days has 
been admitted by the leader of the organization Abdullah Ocalan. 
Ocalan severely warned the members of the organization, saying 
that there has been an incredible number of losses. 
  [Correspondent Fatih Yilmaz] According to available 
information, in his message to PKK field commanders the previous 
day Ocalan said that those responsible for the losses will be 
punished. Ocalan demanded that those not fighting voluntarily be 
dismissed from the organization and called on the PKK to carry 
out low-risk operations such as laying mines, sabotage, and road 
blocks. 
  The PKK conducted mine-laying and roadblock operations 
yesterday. 
  In his message, PKK leader Ocalan said that the losses 
suffered by the organization in Pulumur and Dogubeyazit are 
unacceptably high, and made the following assessment: The field 
commanders are misleading me, the information they provide does 
not conform with reality. 
  The PKK suffered huge losses during operations carried out 
by 
the security forces in the last few months. 
  In the meantime, the mop-up operation launched by the 
security forces on Cudi Mountain is continuing. It is reported 
that major losses has been inflicted on the PKK.

  [Excerpt] Unal Erkan, state of emergency region governor, 
has announced that 607 terrorists were neutralized in operations 
conducted by security forces during the month of May. Speaking 
to citizens in Bingol, Erkan remarked that the terrorist 
organization is on the verge of collapse as a result of 
successful work and that the terrorists are left with the 
options of dying or surrendering. 
  [Begin Erkan recording] Also last month, 500 terrorists were 
killed. Can an organization survive if it loses 500-600 
terrorists in one month? This is not possible in the face of 
our state and our nation. We will conclude this matter. There 
are also other schemes involved. We will be careful. [end 
recording] 
  Stressing that the organization is also serving the 
interests 
of foreign forces, Erkan noted that the pictures taken of the 
terrorist organization's leader with Armenian priests appeared 
in some press organs. [passage omitted]

  [Text] It has been announced that Turkey welcomes the 
German decision to extradite certain terrorists who violate the 
laws and engage in terrorist activities and that it is ready to 
receive those who will be extradited. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement on the issue notes that Turkey 
has, on various occasions in the past, announced that the death 
sentence has not been implemented in the country for the last 10 
years and that every legal and operative measure has been taken 
to prevent torture. Stressing that Turkish-German talks are 
continuing on the preparation of a memorandum of understanding 
concerning those to be extradited, the statement expresses the 
hope that a solution will be reached on the issue soon. The 
statement continues: We are sorry [words indistinct] efforts 
by certain German states to prevent the extradition of these 
persons. No one should doubt that Turkey, just like Germany, is 
a state of law and everyone should refrain from behavior that 
might encourage acts of terror. The existing friendship and 
mutual trust between Turkey and Germany is the strongest 
guarantee to the solution of such problems.

  [Text] Istanbul, May 19 (AFP) -- A small bomb exploded in a 
Roman Catholic church on the western bank of the Bosphorus 
Thursday, church officials said. 
  The blast in the Santa Maria Draperis church in the Beyoglu 
district caused slight damage and no injuries, the officials 
added. 
  In calls to Turkish newspapers, anonymous callers claimed 
the 
blast on behalf of the Islamic Front of Fighters of the Great 
Orient, an armed underground Islamic group believed to have 
staged several attacks against churches and banks.

<F P=106> [Article signed WDN: "Kurdish Leader Kani Yilmaz Denies </F>
Triumphant Reports From Ankara"] 
  [Text] Kani Yilmaz is the representative in Europe of the 
National Front for the Liberation of Kurdistan (ERNK), which is 
closely linked with the guerrilla movement PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan]. Yesterday [18 May], at a press conference in 
Brussels, he denied the triumphant reports released on a 
virtually daily basis by the Turkish Government. Not a day goes 
by without the official Turkish press agency ANATOLIA reporting 
the deaths of dozens of PKK guerrillas. The day before 
yesterday [17 May], General Dogan Guces, the commander of the 
Turkish Army, told the Turkish newspaper HURRIYET that "the PKK 
was eradicated." 
  "We have recently suffered some severe blows," Yilmaz 
admitted, "but on the other hand, the PKK guerrillas have never 
had such a flood of young Kurds streaming to join their ranks 
and fight the Turkish state." 
  "However," Yilmaz went on immediately, "the Turkish 
Government of Prime Minister Ciller is peddling false victories. 
As time goes on, the Turkish Army is daring less and less to 
engage in direct confrontation with the guerrillas, and is 
consequently switching to wholesale psychological warfare, in 
which the Turkish press is playing a key role in spreading 
triumphant reports that are manufactured out of thin air. Not 
we, but Turkish Prime Minister Ciller will surrender before the 
summer is out," Yilmaz predicted. In a detestable war like the 
one currently raging in Turkish Kurdistan, where no prying is 
tolerated, and where many journalists have lost their lives, it 
remains difficult to verify the correctness of any reports. 
However, yesterday [18 May] it was Yilmaz's turn to be 
absolutely sure: "In the last four months, the Kurdish 
guerrillas have suffered 882 losses; 152 PKK fighters have been 
wounded, and eight taken prisoner." Yet Yilmaz contrasts these 
figures with the losses suffered by the Turks: "2,155 soldiers 
and 33 officers have died during the same period, as have 15 
leading watchmen (members of the Turkish militia in Kurdistan); 
moreover, 482 village watchmen were taken without a struggle. A 
total of 884 village watchmen has gone over to the guerrillas." 
  Yilmaz requested that special attention be paid to the 
scorched earth policy currently being implemented by the Turkish 
Army in Kurdistan. "In recent weeks, 30,000 Kurds have fled to 
northern Iraq as a result," Yilmaz said. "And there, they land 
right in the middle of the fight raging between Iraqi Kurdish 
parties under the guerrilla leaders Barzani and Talabani, which 
have already been shelling each other for weeks," he went on. 
According to Yilmaz, "Barzani and Saddam Husayn have joined 
forces to suppress the Kurdish people. Turkey has been given 
the role of clearing Iraq's name of all guilt. Ankara and 
Baghdad are working together closely again in their common fight 
against the Kurdish people," Yilmaz said. 
  Yesterday [18 May], the Kurdish leader reiterated in no 
uncertain terms that the Kurdish guerrillas will continue their 
attacks on the Turkish economy and hence also on tourism in 
Turkey. "We advise foreigners not to come to Turkey. Tourism is 
something one does in the pursuit of pleasure, but surely there 
can be no pleasure in visiting a country where one people is 
killing off another."

<F P=106> [By Chris Parkin and Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] The implications of the most serious Ulster loyalist 
cross-border terrorist attack in 20 years will be assessed by 
British and Irish government ministers tomorrow. 
  Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and deputy 
Dublin premier Dick Spring are to meet near the Irish Republic's 
border with Ulster in Co Cavan at the formal opening of a 
restored canal. 
  The pair had already agreed on a two-hour exchange of views 
on the progress of their two governments' current push for a 
Northern Ireland settlement in the light of Britain's reply last 
week to questions posed by Sinn Fein -- the IRA's political wing 
-- about the five-month-old Downing Street peace declaration. 
  But the gun and bomb attack on a Dublin pub as Sinn Fein 
staged a fund-raising event on the premises has sharpened the 
agenda for the discussions. The loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force 
[UVF] tonight claimed responsibility for the attack which left 
one man dead and a second wounded. 
  In a statement released in Belfast today, the outlawed 
terror 
group boasted that it had "struck at the very heart of the 
republican movement in its own back yard." 
  Mr Spring tonight said he was disturbed about what happened, 
and confirmed the bombing would be high on the agenda when he 
saw Sir Patrick. 
  One doorman was shot dead and another seriously wounded when 
they blocked the entry of the gang of bombers. 
  The intruders fled after the shooting, leaving their holdall 
bomb. Its failure to ignite prevented certain carnage, police 
said. 
  Both Mr Spring and Prime Minister Albert Reynolds -- who is 
due to have talks on peace of his own in London later this week 
with John Major -- had already signalled their growing concern 
about loyalist attacks in Belfast and other parts of Northern 
Ireland. 
  The spread of the violence across the border -- and deep 
into 
the centre of Dublin -- has rung security alarm bells in both 
the Irish capital and Belfast. The fear was that the incident 
at the Widow Scallan's bar could herald the opening of a new 
campaign in the Irish Republic. Until now the assumption had 
been that loyalist paramilitaries lacked the expertise and the 
neccessary network of escape routes to strike so far south. 
  Yet the signs were that not only had their raid been 
executed, even though the 18lb commercial mix bomb failed to go 
off, but the three-man gang had either got back safely into 
Ulster, or gone to ground at a "safe-house". The belief among 
Dublin police tonight was that the gang had carefully laid plans 
to escape from the Republic before road checkpoints were in 
operation at around midnight on Saturday night. 
  The UVF assault was the most menacing by Ulster loyalists 
south of the border since 1974, when bombs in Dublin and the 
frontier town of Monaghan claimed 33 lives. 
  Suspicions have persisted among relatives of the dead that 
loyalists were aided then by Northern Ireland-based security 
personnel. No arrests were ever made in connection with those 
bombings. 
  Since that time, most loyalist activity in the south has 
been 
restricted to firebombings and incidents around the border. 
Eight years ago, audacious gunmen fired on the Dublin 
headquarters of Sinn Fein, and earlier this year, incendiary 
devices were mailed to the same address.

  [Text] In Belfast the Ulster Unionist leader James 
Molyneaux said he regretted what had happened [attack on Dublin 
pub on Saturday], but it was the inevitable result of the fears 
loyalists had over the Downing Street declaration. He spoke to 
Brendan Wright of our northern staff [in Belfast]: 
  [Begin recording] Molyneaux: I regret that [words 
indistinct] of the warning, the caution which I gave to the 
prime minister when he met the other three party leaders along 
with me way back three years ago, when I said that as long as 
there is ambiguity and uncertainty over the constitutional 
future of Northern Ireland there will be attempts to achieve a 
balance of terror. Very regrettably, that is what is now coming 
about. 
  Wright: Are you saying that you always thought 
there was a certain inevitability about loyalist paramilitary 
attacks in the south? 
  Molyneaux: Well, in the south and in Northern 
Ireland, too, I mean, the weight of their attacks, let's face 
it, has been in Northern Ireland, not in the south. They've 
only had one attack in Dublin in the recent years, but look how 
many you've had in Northern Ireland within the last month. So 
it's a far, far bigger problem in Northern Ireland. 
  Wright: Now, of course, you don't speak for the 
loyalist paramilitaries, but do you have any view as to why the 
UDF [Ulster Defense Force] should have carried out this attack? 
  Molyneaux: Well, I don't know, but it's been that 
pattern, what I say, a balance of terror. It's part of the 
pattern of the attacks in Northern Ireland. It can't be 
separated from that. It's all of a piece. 
  Wright: And what do you think will be the effect 
of the attack in Dublin? 
  Molyneaux: Well, I think that probably they are 
bound to be worried, as we all are worried in Belfast, by what 
has been going on up here in this end of the island, for all of 
these recent weeks particularly. I think that probably in the 
minds of people in Whitehall, the draughtsmen of various 
documents and so forth, they don't really understand the feeling 
of exclusion, alienation if you like, of people in Northern 
Ireland and they look at various documents which have been 
drafted by -- and I'm being racist here -- by Englishmen who 
don't have a feel for the situation, and when they're read over 
here in the Shankill Road they look like a sellout and then 
certain people tell them it's a sellout and that doesn't help, 
either. 
  Wright: And do you think part of the reasoning 
behind carrying out this attack might well be to try and force 
the Dublin government to change their attitude towards Sinn Fein 
and the IRA? I mean, some people in the loyalist quarters 
consider the Dublin goverment to be nothing more than messenger 
boys for Sinn Fein. 
  Molyneaux: Well, it's -- yes, it's not just what I 
think about it, but they actually have said that that is the 
position. I mean, those who have carried out the attacks have 
said that actually in their statements when they claimed 
responsibility, if you like -- I think that's the term they tend 
to use -- but they have said that that's the object of it, and 
who are we to dispute that? 
  Wright: At the weekend, on Friday, you called on 
loyalist paramilitaries to cease their violence. It's only been 
a matter of a few days, but do you think your message will get 
through to them? 
  Molyneaux: Well, I think the fact that -- and 
despite what has happened and all the regrettable things have 
happened including the bombing in Dublin -- I think despite all 
of that it is very encouraging that even as recently as this 
morning they are saying now that -- and letting it be known -- 
that their combined leadership, whatever structure it may be, 
are going to this week to be considering more carefully the 
statement I made and what lies behind that statement, namely, 
the routes which were slightly obscure in the declaration which 
have been more clearly signposted in the clarification document, 
and it's now easier to point out to people and easier to make 
them understand that that route always was there, that it's now 
much more clearly identified. [end recording]

  [Text] Algiers (DPA) -- The seizing of an arms delivery in 
Morocco, which was destined to Algerian fundamentalists, has 
given rise to speculations in Algeria about the international 
ties of the armed Islamic fundamentalists. On Wednesday [25 
May] the Moroccan judiciary announced that the six Moroccans and 
two Algerians, who were arrested on 17 May carried large amounts 
of weapons and military equipment, including 13 submachine guns, 
ammunition, and 12 infrared night-vision devices. According to 
the head of the group, 34-year-old Moroccan Ighir Hassan, the 
weapons were bought in Germany and brought to Morocco via Spain. 
  Thus, for the second time this month, Germany is accused of 
being the country of origin of weapons used by the armed groups 
in Algeria in the battle against the ruling regime. On 6 May, 
on the German-French border, French police arrested an Algerian 
who had just entered the country from Germany carrying 5,000 
rounds of ammunition, 13 kg of explosives, three automatic 
weapons, and other military equipment in his car. In both cases 
the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), which is banned in Algeria, 
was reportedly the customer. 
  According to Algerian information, several prominent members 
of the FIS have asked for political asylum in Germany, including 
the sons of FIS founder Abassi Madani, who is in prison in 
Algeria, as well as Rabah Kebir, the fundamentalist party's boss 
abroad. The latter is accused by Algeria of having been 
essentially involved in the bomb attack on the airport in 
Algeria on 26 August 1992, during which nine people were killed. 
The special court in Algiers has, therefore, sentenced him to 
death in absentia. In September 1993, the Munich Regional Court 
repealed an extradition warrant for Kebir, because the documents 
presented by Algiers did not provide sufficient justification of 
the suspicion.

  [Text] It looks as though someone planned an attempt on the 
life of Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, when he visited St. 
Petersburg between 16 and 19 May. On 16 May, security guards 
discovered a plastic bag containing a time bomb between the 
doors of a shop of the British firm Littlewoods in Tukhachevskiy 
Avenue. The alarm hand connected with the firing device and 
four kilograms of TNT pointed at eight o'clock. Had the 
explosive device gone off, the shop would have been blown to 
pieces. The Prince of Wales did visit Littlewoods, but at 
another time.

  [Text] It has been learned that the military columns under 
the command of the Western Military Command and members of the 
Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and 
local residents are blocking the routes, crushing, and enjoying 
the victory over the members of the RSO [Rohingya Solidarity 
Organization] or Kalarzo terrorist organization, who cannot 
stand to see the all-round development programs being carried 
out for the country to become a peaceful, modern, and developed 
state. The members of the RSO, who are based on the other side 
of the country [near Bangladesh], entered into the Maungdaw area 
in Rakhine State in the last week of April to engage in 
destructive bombing activities to cause instability in the 
region. 
  Members of the RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group organized the 
youths who absconded from Myanmar to Bangladesh in 1991 by 
persuading and rewarding them. The group also provided the 
basic military training course to the youths. 
  The RSO or Kalarzo terrorists entered Maungdaw Township from 
the sea by schooners in the last week of April 1994. At 
midnight on 28 April 1994, nine out of 12 time bombs planted in 
12 different places in Maungdaw Township by these Kalarzo 
terrorists exploded at different times. One fire engine and 
some buildings were damaged, while four civilians were seriously 
wounded in the explosions. The remaining three unexploded time 
bombs were confiscated by the authorities. On the same night, a 
RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group comprising about 80 members 
entered Maungdaw, (Taunggyan), Minlut, Kyaukpandu regions in 
Mayu Taunggyaw, while another group comprising about 40 members 
entered northern part of Maungdaw, Bandoola, Aungthabye, 
(Minkanaung) regions in Mayu Taungdan. 
  The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the southern part of 
Maungdaw burned down the houses in Kyaukpandu Village at 0200 on 
1 May. Ten civilian houses were destroyed in the fire. The 
same group attacked the new ideal Zeyawaddy Village with small 
arms and burned down the houses at 0300 on 2 May. Two houses 
belonged to the village workers and 14 civilian houses were 
destroyed, while one civilian was killed and a 17-year-old girl 
was injured in the incident. 
  The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the northern part of 
Maungdaw burned down 13 houses in Shwetaung Village at 1030 on 
10 May. On 15 May, two civilians from Aungthabye Village were 
also injured when they stepped on a mine planted by these 
terrorists. 
  The military columns under the command of the Western 
Military Command, members of the Border Supervisory Units and 
local People's Police Force, and local residents -- a combined 
force of 26,000 people -- blocked the routes and attacked and 
crushed these terrorists. 
  Up to 19 May, there were 13 encounters with the terrorists. 
During the encounters, 52 terrorists were killed. The 
authorities also arrested eight people involved in planting the 
bombs in Maungdaw. The authorities also confiscated 16 assorted 
guns, 10 40-mm shells, 1,418 assorted mines, 522 hand grenades, 
3,611 rounds of assorted ammunition, five communication 
equipment, two schooners belonged to the Kalarzo terrorists, 
cash 400,400 kyats, and 153 takas. 
  It has been learned that these hand grenades, mines, and 
explosives are provided by the foreign terrorist organizations. 
During the clashes, four of our soldiers laid down their lives 
for the country while three were injured. 
  It has been learned that the military columns, members of 
the 
Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and 
local residents are searching and attacking the remaining RSO or 
Kalarzo terrorists.

<F P=106> [Statement by unidentified spokesman of the party of </F>
Democratic Kampuchea issued on 20 May; place not given -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] I. A grenade was reportedly thrown into the 
Malaysian embassy in Phnom Penh on the night of 18 May 1994. 
The report said the grenade attack is related to the issue of 
foreign military aid to the two-headed government. 
  II. The two-headed government has accused the Khmer Rouge 
[KR] of throwing the grenade. 
  III. The spokesman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK] vehemently and utterly rejects the above-mentioned 
abominable and despicable accusation by the two-headed 
government, which is the out-and-out puppet and tool of the 
communist Vietnamese and the alliance of the mischievous 
superpowers with the U.S., France, and Australia as the 
ringleaders. 
  IV. The public opinion inside and outside the country, the 
Cambodian people, and people in the region have all known, 
heard, and seen clearly that the two-headed elements -- puppets 
of the communist Vietnamese and the United States -- are the 
traitors who have sold out the nation and unhesitatingly killed 
the Cambodian people. These two-headed elements are the cause 
of terror in society and of insecurity throughout Phnom Penh, 
including theft, robbery, murder, vice, the path of ruin and 
immorality, corruption, prostitution, AIDS, and so forth. 
  All these have emanated from systematic preparations, plans, 
and activities of the communist Vietnamese, communist Vietnamese 
puppets, and remnants of the evil allies. 
  V. The Cambodian people want national reconciliation and 
peace. The two-headed elements only act in contrast to what the 
people want. King Norodom Sihanouk has warned if the war dies, 
peace will survive. The answer from the two-headed elements is 
war, war, and war! After suffering serious and bitter defeats 
at Anlung Veng and Pailin with all strategic forces and all 
kinds of weapons smashed and arms, tanks, and artillery left 
behind on the battlefield, they have loudly called on their 
partners to provide arms aid to the two- headed government for 
carrying on the war to further kill the Cambodian nation and 
people. 
  The Cambodian people have gone through many tests and 
trials. 
They will definitely not allow the traitors, foreign lackeys, 
arch corrupt elements, and evil allies to suck their blood and 
rule the roost at will. The current of people's desire for 
national reconciliation and peace is enormous and mighty. By 
going against this current, all of you will definitely perish 
like salt dissolved by water and candle burned away by fire. 
  [Dated] 20 May 1994 
  [Signed] The PDK spokesman

was a member of a southern separatist group preparing to carry 
out an act of sabotage in the South.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 25 
May. 
  On 11 May, 40 members of the Jaime Bateman Cayon column, a 
dissident group of the 19 April Movement, occupied for three and 
one-half hours a stretch of the Pan-American Highway between 
Ibague and Armenia, 10 km from La Linea. The guerrillas blew up 
the toll booth for the sixth time, stole 1.6 million pesos, and 
burned two vehicles in an action that left four people wounded. 
On 12 May, one guerrilla was killed and six arrested in 
Antioquia, Santander Department. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 13 May 94 p 8A) 
  On 14 May, Army of National Liberation (ELN) members 
belonging to the Camilo Torres Front killed Oswaldo Arturo 
Pajaro Garcia, president of the Municipal Council of Aguachica, 
Cesar Department, and kidnapped Alderman Elibardo Galvis 
Barrera. In another incident, guerrillas suspected of belonging 
to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia burned a Colombian 
Air Force plane which had made an emergency landing in Caqueta 
Department. The plane was attacked while the crew members were 
seeking assistance. Meanwhile, 40 ELN guerrillas kidnapped 
Sucre Mayor Juan Carlos Cure Ramirez, releasing him three hours 
later after having forced him to give them a financial report. 
(Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 18 May 94 p 8A) 
  On 20 May, Colombian police rescued industrialist Joaquin 
Prada San Miguel, who was kidnapped 10 days earlier by ELN 
guerrillas in Santander Department. Five rebels were killed and 
several weapons were confiscasted during the operation. (Mexico

  [Excerpts] Early this morning terrorist groups opposed to 
the peace agreement scheduled to be officially signed today at 
approximately 1100 in the Granizal section of Medellin set fire 
to approximately 10 buses, causing damages amounting to 115 
million pesos. The peace agreement is between the government 
and 600 militia members of Medellin's northeastern and 
northwestern communities. [passage omitted] 
  With the support of the Army and the police, urban bus 
services are gradually being restored to Medellin and the 
surrounding communities. Currently the Granizal area is 
cordoned off and heavily militarized. After 1000 this morning 
in Granizales, during an event led by Government Minister Fabio 
Villegas Ramirez, the peace agreement will be signed by three of 
Medellin's five popular militias. This translates into the 
demobilization and disarmament of approximately 650 men from the 
three armed groups. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1318 GMT on 26 May reports that 
three taxis, as well as 10 buses, were burned and that no 
injuries or fatalities were reported. The report says that bus 
service in Medellin has been drastically reduced because of fear 
among bus drivers and owners that their vehicles might be 
targeted, adding that authorities believe that the escalation of 
guerrilla activities is related to the 29 May elections.]

  [Text] Chisinau, BASAPRESS, 20/5/1994 -- A group of 
terrorists from Vilnius came to Dniester, at the invitation of 
Vadim Shevtsov (Antiufeev), chairman of the Dniester Security 
Committee, stated Col. Mikhail Bergman of the 14th Army to Asket 
TV in Tiraspol and retranslated by the "Teleradio-Moldova" state 
company. According to Bergman, "through Dniestrian security's 
help and support, criminals who conceal their real name are 
coming into the region." Thus, a certain Gudyma who came 
recently from Moscow at the security minister's invitation had a 
passport indicating two years' Dniester citizenship. Bergman 
also pointed out that Tiraspol officials illegally issued 900 
permits for weapons to ministers and company managers. Among 
those who receive the permits were Galina Andreyeva, an OSTK 
[expression unknown] leader, Anatoli Bolshakov, Vladimir 
Vorobiov, managers of large industrial enterprises, Aleksey 
Tokarev, manager of an Austrian joint firm and currently an 
Austrian citizen, etc. Col. Bergman mentioned that over 24 
carbines were stolen from 14th Army weapon storage during the 
Dniester conflict. Ten of these carbines were bought by the 
prosecutor general, Boris Luchik, Tiraspol leader Igor Smirnov, 
Vadim Shevtsov (Antiufeev) and Belusov, respectively chairman 
and deputy chairman of the Security Committee, Aleksandr 
Karaman, Dniester vice president and other Tiraspol officials. 
The guns were simply given to them as gifts for which they 
would later receive special permits, added Bergman. According to 
him, Aleksandr Karaman possesses six guns. Bergman said that 
Smirnov opened in Austria an account for $5 million and during a 
recent visit in this country he withdrew $1.5 million. He also 
said that Smirnov is building a villa on the "Uzbekistan" 
sanatorium's property in Yalta, Crimea, using construction 
materials from Dniester.

patrol car passed by, coming from the stadium. Preliminary 
information received by AM/PM newscast indicates six agents were 
riding in the patrol car destroyed by the explosion. One 
officer and three policemen died, and two were critically 
injured. The patrol car was part of a police caravan in charge 
of the security for a soccer match in Colombia. This street was 
the only route the caravan could take to reach their command 
post. The policemen spent the whole game facing the crowd to 
guarantee the players' safety.

  Witnesses claim they had seen various vehicles parked 50

left when the police caravan approached. The explosion failed 
to damage other patrol cars but it caused damage to all 
surrounding buildings.

  [Text] Although authorities have not ruled out that the 
Guerrilla Coordinating Board could have exploded a car bomb [on 
22 May] that killed six men in uniform and injured nine other 
people, the strongest theory is that this was a strike by the 
terrorist wing of the Medellin Cartel. 
  An official report states that after it was announced that 
Germany's Eintracht soccer team would play at the Atanasio 
Girardot Stadium intelligence organizations traced several 
telephone threats against this team, because the government of 
that country refused to grant asylum to the family of the late 
capo Pablo Escobar Gaviria

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 26 May (NOTIMEX) -- The political 
crisis facing the Dominican Republic was reflected today in the 
explosion of five homemade bombs in various streets of Esperanza 
municipality without causing any casualties, the police reported. 
  The bombs were hurled by hooded individuals and one of them 
exploded near the headquarters of the Dominican Revolutionary 
Party (PRD) headed by Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential 
candidate in the 16 May elections who has made accusations of 
fraud. A police report said that there were no casualties but 
there were several arrests of individuals presumably responsible 
for the attacks. The police and Army initiated a surveillance 
operation along the streets to prevent another attack. 
  The political crisis erupted when the elections closed with 
the PRD making accusations of a "scandalous fraud" planned by 
the followers of President Joaquin Balaguer at the Central 
Electoral Board (JCE) computer center. 
  Tourism representatives reported that numerous trips, 
especially from Europe, were suspended because of the news 
generated by the crisis facing the country. "The Dominican 
Republic political situation is a threat to the tourism industry 
which generates substantial revenues for the country," an 
important tourism businessman pointed out. The Dominican 
Republic is visited by 1.4 million tourists who generate more 
than $130 million, the equivalent of 70 percent of its 
exportable goods.

  [Text] Quito, 25 May (EFE) -- A large area of Quito was 
left without drinking water when two charges of dynamite 
exploded in the city's main water processing plant early 
yesterday. Today, the police continue defusing explosives in 
the installation, Patricio Ribadeneira, manager of the 
Municipal Drinking Water Enterprise (EMAP), stated. 
  The explosives destroyed the energy tower that allows the 
plant to function. No group has claimed responsibility for the 
attack, which "regrettably means the suspension of drinking 
water service in a large area of the city for several days," the 
manager noted. "The police are also helping workers of EMAP and 
the electricity enterprise handle the problem, because some 
charges have not exploded and constitute an imminent danger," 
Ribadeneira added.

<F P=106> [Report by Alfredo Villareal; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A criminal attack took place in San Salvador this 
morning. It is still not clear if the attack was criminal in 
nature or political. Again, FMLN [Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front] leader Nidia Diaz's [nom de guerre for Maria 
Concepcion Valladares de Sosa] bodyguard received the brunt of 
the attack and this time he was injured in an arm. The 
bodyguard suffered a similar attack three months ago. According 
to the now FMLN Deputy Nidia Diaz, the attack was aimed at her 
on both occasions. She, thus, stated that former guerrilla 
commanders do not have any security to participate in politics. 
  Diaz's bodyguard suffered the second attack in less than 
three months today. According to the reports, Elmer Cruz 
Pineda, a PNC [National Civilian Police] member assigned to 
Nidia Diaz' security, drove the vehicle that was hit by 20 
rounds of 9-mm pistol and M-16 rifle fire. Furthermore, the 
attackers threw a grenade that seriously injured the bodyguard's 
right arm. 
  [Begin recording] Cruz: There was an attack on 
Mrs. Nidia Diaz at about 0600 this morning. It is estimated 
that it was carried out by Army soldiers who do not agree with 
the peace accords. I believe there is no two ways about this. 
It can't be anybody else but them. 
  Reporter: What did you do when you were attacked? 
  Cruz: I fought off the attack and defended myself. 
I was alone at the time and I tried to defend myself. [end 
recording] 
  The attack was made on the same vehicle that was attacked 
last time; it took place in front of the political leader's 
house, located on Los Lirios Avenue in the University 
neighborhood, at approximately 0630. The attackers were fought 
off by just one man. They crashed their vehicle after the 
attack, leaving it approximately two blocks from Deputy Diaz' 
house. 
  [Begin Diaz recording] We no longer use bullets in politics. 
We are civilians and work within the institutional framework of 
the government. This event is very serious because we 
supposedly have guarantees and believe we can have confidence. 
I would like to go about without any bodyguards and move about 
just as any other person. All of a sudden this happens and you 
realize that you have to have a bodyguard. I feel it is much 
more dangerous because we have placed our trust is the system 
and have presented ourselves, with all our characteristics, our 
people, our relatives, under the protection of the government's 
institutions. [end recording] 
  Nidia Diaz, who now has a large group of bodyguards 24 hours 
a day, reported the charges to the joint group. 
  [Begin unidentified bodyguard recording] We have to be on 
our 
guard at all times when we are with her. We have to make sure 
we are not being followed. [end recording] 
  Definitely, the violence in our country does not stop and 
the 
people responsible for countering it have not found the means to 
do so.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Salvadoran Gen. Mauricio Ernesto </F>
Vargas, former deputy chief of staff of the Armed Forces and 
member of the Dialogue Commission, by unidentified reporter on 
19 May; from the "KL Radio News" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Reporter: Good morning General, we 
would like to hear your opinion on the attack on the security 
guards of FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
Deputy Nidia Diaz [nom de guerre of Maria Concepcion Valladares 
de Sosa]. 
  Vargas: [passage omitted] The fact that this is 
the second attack on this same person, specifically this same 
security guard, is strange. I believe this should be thoroughly 
investigated and that the weight of the law should fall upon 
those who are responsible, so that the exemplary punishment can 
dissuade others from acting the same way within Salvadoran 
society. 
  Reporter: Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the 
political connotations that this attack could have. As member 
of the Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the 
Chapultepec Agreements how do you view these actions against a 
party like the FMLN which recently entered the country's 
political life? 
  Vargas: As I said.... [pauses] although I did not 
say it directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the 
attack was against the same person, the same security guard who 
was attacked the first time. As you said, this incident 
warrants a thorough investigation, as it could have other 
connotations. Attacks that could occur at a given time which 
could be directly or indirectly related to political groups 
should be rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against 
ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic 
Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all 
political parties. [passage omitted] 
  This case should be given more attention because there could 
be factors that are not political, which if not properly 
investigated can have repercussions in the political field, 
which of course would be totally undesirable. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Speaking to reporters about the arrest of an Iranian 
suspect in the abortive bomb attempt against the Israeli Embassy 
in March, Interior Minister General Chawalit Yongchaiyut said 
police authorities have gathered strong evidence to incriminate 
the suspect after more than two months of investigation and he 
praised the police authorities for the success. 
  Meanwhile, Police General Prathin Santipraphop disclosed 
that 
police arrested Hossein Shahriari, 26, at Inthra Hotel in Hat 
Yai District late last night after receiving a report from the 
immigration checkpoint in Sadao District on his re-entry into 
Thailand through the checkpoint that the same evening. He 
firmly believed that authorities have sufficient evidence to 
prosecute the suspect. [see item BK2705032994 in 3 June

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Porter, chief reporter: "MI6 Targeting </F>
Iran as Main Threat to West"] 
  [Excerpt] Britain's public warning to Iran to sever its 
links with the IRA stems from a policy decision that MI6 should 
target the Iranians as the most potent threat to Western 
security. 
  The decision was taken when the collapse of the Soviet Union 
freed resources tied up since the Cold War began. Although 
Russia still takes up a large chunk of MI6 resources, the 
intelligence spotlight has increasingly shone on Iran. 
  The high quality of evidence behind the British warning 
indicates intense intelligence activity over a long period. 
Names, dates, places of meetings, details of financial and arms 
proposals -- including ground-to-air missiles -- were all 
collated before the British Government decided to act. 
  Relations between the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOI) 
and Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA have been under intense 
intelligence scrutiny, as have the Iranian front men heading the 
operation. 
  Plans to arm and finance the IRA have been personally 
supervised by Amir Eravani -- known in the West as Amir Hussein 
Taghavi -- who is MOI chief for Western Europe and America. 
  The co-ordinator of links with the IRA is said to be an 
Iranian diplomat based in The Hague. Other agents enjoy 
diplomatic cover in European capitals including Bonn and Paris. 
  Although there is no evidence of arms having been sent to 
the 
IRA, it is likely that some financial aid has been given. The 
MOI is believed to provide similar aid to other groups such as 
the Basque ETA and Japan's Red Army Faction. 
  Britain's warning has worsened relations with Iran which 
have 
been at a low level since the late Ayatollah Khomeini called for 
the death of Salman Rushdie in 1989. He claimed Rushdie's novel, 
The Satanic Verses, blasphemed Islam. 
  The Tehran Times, the influential Tehran 
English-language daily, yesterday accused London of sheltering 
"anti-Iranian terrorists." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by James Adams: "Revealed: How Iran's Terror </F>
Network Embraced the IRA"] 
  [Text] The IRA leaders flew secretly to Tehran, taking 
steps to ensure they were not being tailed on the journey from 
their homes in Ireland. The meeting they were attending last 
November was one of the group's most important for a long time: 
a gathering of the world's terror organisations at the behest of 
their Iranian paymasters. 
  As the IRA bosses walked into the Feirouzi palace, they 
joined leading figures from some of the most secretive and 
feared groups in the world: the Japanese Red Army, the Basque 
terrorist group, Eta, Hezbollah, the Abu Nidal organisation and 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General 
Command. 
  The terrorists were met by Muhsin Reza'i, commander of the 
Iranian Revolutionary Guard. There was only one item on the 
agenda: a plan by Iran to fund and arm a new "terrorist 
international" in exchange for the launching of attacks against 
western targets. 
  The aim was to cause unprecedented devastation in western 
European capitals with co-ordinated bombings and assassinations. 
According to senior intelligence officials, Iran hoped to fuel 
revolution in Europe and make it pay a heavy price for 
supporting American policies in the Middle East. 
  The meeting, the biggest terrorist gathering since the early 
1970s, was closely monitored by western intelligence. 
Immediately afterwards, agencies across Europe and the United 
States began a counter-terrorist drive to track the Iranian 
diplomats, known terrorists and their contacts in Europe. The 
biggest undercover operation since the Gulf war, it involved 
satellite surveillance, intercepting telephone calls and 
widespread bugging. 
  British security services were especially concerned that the 
Iranians pledged to supply the IRA with sophisticated weapons as 
well as millions of pounds. The republicans had been searching 
for a supply of modern detonators and ground-to-air missiles to 
complement their stockpile of small arms, ammunition and 
explosives. 
  The IRA presence in Tehran came as no surprise to British 
intelligence, which had watched links developing between Tehran 
and Irish republicans for more than a decade. 
  The contacts began in 1981 when an Iranian diplomat went to 
Belfast to attend the funeral of Bobby Sands, the first hunger 
striker. He was soon followed by Hojatoleslam Hadi Ghaffari, an 
Iranian cleric nicknamed the "machine-gun mullah" after killing 
up to 60 pro-Shah officials. 
  Although Ghaffari antagonised Sinn Fein by refusing to pay 
for drinks at a lunch he hosted, the republicans found the 
cleric sympathetic. In 1980, he told a rally in Tehran that "we 
are ready to blow up British factories and ships. Now is the 
time for the death of Thatcher." 
  Over the next six years the two sides developed their 
friendship. A Sinn Fein delegation attended the Conference of 
World Movements in Tehran in June 1982, while Iran sent a 
delegation to Sinn Fein's annual Dublin conference for three 
years running. The relationship, however, was largely political 
as the IRA was receiving arms and weapons from Libya. 
  Then in December 1987, Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the 
IRA's political wing, flew to Tehran as the guest of the Iranian 
government. Exactly what was discussed is not known, but soon 
afterwards the first clandestine contacts between the terrorists 
and Tehran began. 
  Over the next six years, both MI6 and MI5 tracked IRA 
terrorists to secret meetings in Paris, Bonn and The Hague. Each 
took place with accredited Iranian diplomats, most of whom were 
attached to the Ministry of Information (MOI) in Tehran, a cover 
for Iranian intelligence. 
  Apart from Ghaffari, three key Iranians have been identified 
by British intelligence. They are Ali Reza Hakkikian, chief MOI 
representative in Bonn until 1993; Vahid Attarian, his 
replacement in Bonn believed to co-ordinate operations of 
Iranian spies across Europe; and Amir Eravani, responsible for 
liaison between the MOI and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  To begin with, British intelligence was content to monitor 
the relationship. It wanted to track the IRA officers 
responsible for negotiating arms and cash abroad and to unravel 
the intelligence network run by the Iranians. 
  The tone of the operation changed when Jurgen Merx and 
Tunza-Anet, his wife, were arrested in Athens last year for 
smuggling huge quantities of heroin to Britain. The drugs were 
thought to have been supplied by Iranian intelligence, perhaps 
to generate funds for the IRA. At the same time, there was 
intelligence that cash from Iran might already have reached 
Belfast and that a big arms shipment was being planned. 
  Then came the terrorist summit last November. It was no 
longer simply a British effort to control the IRA, but an 
international attempt to foil a threat to the security of 
several western European countries. 
  The French government launched raids against Muslim 
extremists and members of the Kurdish Workers' party. Germany, 
Spain, Sweden and Italy have also moved against groups suspected 
of having contacts with the Iranians. 
  For Britain, the problem was more difficult. Although many 
IRA terrorists are well known to the security forces and those 
directly involved with the Iranians had been tracked, there was 
not enough evidence to bring anyone to trial. Instead, it was 
decided to confront the Iranians directly in the hope that 
publicity would force the IRA to break off contacts. 
  So, on Thursday, Douglas Hogg, the Foreign Office minister, 
summoned Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, for a 
confrontation about his government's contacts with the IRA. The 
Iranian denied the links, claiming there was "no shred of 
evidence to support these astonishing claims." 
  Security sources said this weekend it was too early to 
determine if the move has worked. The Iranian government has a 
long history of defiance and few doubt that the IRA will try to 
continue to tap the deep pockets and well-stocked armouries of 
Tehran.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Savill, in Belfast: "IRA `Wanted Iran </F>
Missiles'"] 
  [Text] Iran called in Britain's senior envoy to 
formally deny any plot to arm and fund the IRA. Mr Jeffrey 
James, charge d'affaires in Tehran, was told the allegations 
were unfounded but British officials say they have information 
linking top Iranian intelligence figures with the IRA. 
  The IRA may have been attempting to procure a large shipment 
of weapons from Iran in preparation for taking the terrorist 
campaign into the next century, security sources said yesterday. 
  Despite the Anglo/Irish peace initiative, the sources 
believe 
a hardline faction within the IRA remains intent on replenishing 
and updating its arms. 
  High on its list of priorities are sophisticated 
surface-to-air missiles capable of being used against military 
helicopters in Northern Ireland, the sources believe. Twenty 
SAM-7 ground-to-air missiles were found among a cargo of 
Libyan-supplied arms on board the IRA gun-running vessel, the 
Eksund, which was captured off France in 1987. 
  As a result of the Eksund discovery, military helicopters in 
Northern Ireland were equipped with protective devices and 
pilots were forced to switch flying patterns. 
  Recent evidence in the American courts suggest the IRA has 
tried to obtain the more advanced Stinger ground-to air missiles 
which security sources acknowledge would pose a serious threat. 
  Helicopters are used to carry VIPs during visits to Ulster 
and the Army depends on them to operate in the so-called "bandit 
country" along the border. 
  A security source said the IRA would probably like to 
acquire 
more anti-aircraft type weapons and the reason they had not been 
successful in using them so far was a lack of training.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- The Japanese Government is 
exaggerating the threat from North Korea over its refusal to 
allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities, the 
Japanese Red Army claims in statements reaching Japan on 
Wednesday [1 Jun]. 
  The statements, sent to the Red Army's contacts in Japan, 
mark the May 30, 1972, Red Army machine-gun and grenade attack 
on passengers at Lod Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel. 
  That attack was carried out as a mark of solidarity with the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
  This year's statement claims the United States is creating 
tensions by using the threat from North Korea to promote its own 
plans to achieve nuclear exclusivity. 
  "The Japanese Government also accepts this and, in line with 
the United Nations, is agitating over whether or not to 
introduce sanctions," the statement says. 
  The statement also says Japan should reflect on its 
aggression during World War II and observe the spirit of peace 
enunciated in Article 9 of its constitution. 
  It says the Red Army opposes Japan's bid for a permanent 
seat 
on the UN Security Council.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Police Monday [30 May] 
arrested a member of a right-wing organization after he fired a 
gunshot at the ceiling of a hotel lobby in an abortive attempt 
to attack former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa, who escaped unhurt, was on his way home from a 
party marking the establishment of the Tokyo chapter of the 
Japan New Party [JNP] which he heads, held at the Keio Plaza 
Hotel. 
  Police identified the suspect as Masakatsu Nozoe, 52. His 
shot missed the target as plainclothes men slapped the gunman on 
his hands holding a revolver aimed at Hosokawa, witnesses said. 
  But police later quoted Nozoe as saying he first aimed at 
Hosokawa but then fired at the ceiling. 
  The alleged assailant later told police that he had become 
upset with Hosokawa's apologies for Japan's wartime 
responsibilities and over his economic policies. 
  According to police, Nozoe approached the former prime 
minister in the third floor lobby of the hotel and fired the gun 
in the direction of Hosokawa. 
  Police officers immediately subdued the assailant, while 
plainclothes officers rushed the former premier out of the hotel 
and into a waiting car. 
  A shaken Hosokawa reportedly expressed concern for his wife 
as he was escorted out of the hotel, saying, "Kayoko is still 
here. Please (take care of her)." 
  Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding 
his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile 
coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
  He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at 
his Karuizawa retreat and at Tokyo hotels. 
  According to party sources, Hosokawa has been threatened by 
rightist organizations since assuming office last August over 
his apologies for Japanese atrocities during World War II. The 
JNP has reportedly taken precautions to protect Hosokawa since 
then.

  [Excerpts] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A gunman threatened 
former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on Monday [30 May] with 
a shot at the ceiling of a Tokyo hotel in what he called a show 
of protest against Hosokawa's past remarks on World War II and 
economic policies, police said. [passage omitted] 
  The last known rightist attack on a politician came in March 
1992 when a shot was fired at Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced 
kingmaker of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Hosokawa, who has been burdened with questions surrounding 
his financial dealings, resigned last month as head of a fragile 
coalition government which replaced four decades of rule by the 
LDP. 
  He has since maintained a low profile, reportedly staying at

  [Text] Santiago, 1 Jun (EFE) -- The Manuel Rodriguez 
Patriotic Movement (MPMR), which abandoned the armed struggle in 
1990, has asked the government of President Eduardo Frei for a 
draft law to allow 300 of its militants to be exempt from 
judicial proceedings. 
  MPMR leaders announced they will create an Orientation 
Office 
to gather information on "the situation of the militants living 
clandestinely." 
  The announcement was made through a document released today 
entitled "For the Normalization of the Life of Militants Who 
Fought Against the Dictatorship" which is signed by leaders 
Leandro Torchio, Cesar Quiroz, and Marcos Riquelme. 
  The document says that 34 of a total of 50 MPMR militants 
who 
escaped from jail under the Pinochet regime are living 
clandestinely and that another 270 are wanted by the law. 
  "There are about 300 militants who did not go through 
Pinochet's jails and who are being persecuted" said the leaders 
of the MPMR -- which is a splinter group of the Manuel Rodriguez 
Patriotic Front (FPMR) -- who in 1990 decided to join the 
democratic life. 
  The FPMR, which was created in 1984, decided to continue the 
armed struggle during the democratic government of Patricio 
Aylwin (1990-1994) who was accused of continuing the military 
policy. 
  The MPMR leaders believe it is necessary to legislate on the 
situation of those who struggled against the military regime and 
to establish the provisional release of those who have appeared 
in court to resolve their situation. 
  They also recalled that the militants fought against a 
regime 
that was condemned for 17 years by the United Nations for 
serious human right violations. They added that these people 
only committed the crime of "not yielding in their struggle for 
democracy." 
  The MPMR confirmed that Sergio Buschmann, actor and fugitive 
from justice who escaped from a Chilean jail in 1987, will 
return to Chile on 15 June accompanied by a U.S. lawyer. 
  Buschmann was arrested by the military regime for running a 
covert operation to introduce an arms shipment in Chile in 1976. 
  Buschmann lives in Nicaragua and has decided to return to 
Chile to face a trial which he hopes will create awareness over 
the situation of the so-called former members of the resistance 
against the dictatorship.

<F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] Today, ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrillas 
blew up a stretch of the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline near the 
municipality of Pelaya in southern Cesar Department. 
  More than 8,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into Gamboa 
ravine that flows into the Zapatosa marsh. This rich 
agricultural and cattle region is now facing an environmental 
emergency as result of actions carried out by organized criminal 
groups. Over the past two weeks, several guerrilla attacks have 
taken place in this same area and have polluted rivers and 
streams throughout the region. 
  This afternoon, ECOPETROL [Colombian Petroleum Enterprise] 
technicians began implementing emergency measures to prevent the 
oil spill from spreading, reaching the marsh, and causing 
irreparable environmental damage. 
  In another attack, ELN guerrillas arrived at Villa del 
Rosario, Norte de Santander, some time after 0200 and proceeded 
to detonate explosive devices at the police department and the 
mayor's office. Several buildings near the police station, 
including the local comptroller's office, were also damaged by 
the blasts. 
  Following the attack, the ELN column proceeded to ambush a 
police patrol in Villa del Rosario, Cucuta. Three police 
officers were killed and four others seriously wounded in the 
attack.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 1 
June. 
  A few hours after the Cano Limon-Covenas Pipeline had 
resumed 
operations following 20 days of semiparalysis by the fire that 
destroyed five plants, guerrillas dynamited the line yesterday, 
knocking it out of service. The rebel attack, which caused the 
spilling of more than 5,000 barrels of crude, occurred at km 437 
in the Municipality of El Tarra, in northern Santander 
Department. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 May 94 
p9a) 
  The murder of Aguedo Calle, a member of the Communist 
Party's 
regional electoral commission, Chigorodo, in the Uraba banana 
region, disclosed on Thursday evening the existence of a new 
group that takes justice into its own hands. Although the new, 
self- styled, paramilitary group the "People's Children" (Hijos 
del Pueblo) has not claimed responsibility for the crime, 
authorities believe it was one of its actions. Alleged 
spokespersons for that group have sent a communique to the 
Chigorodo Municipal Prosecuting Office claiming responsibility 
for the murder of Gabriel Ortega, the Patriotic Union candidate 
for mayor, who was shot in Chigorodo last week. (Santa Fe de 
Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 28 May 94 p 9a) 
  A guerrilla terrorist plan to destroy political and 
government offices, as well as the Justice Palace in Cucuta, was 
discovered in northern Santander Department yesterday. In 
addition, an action to disrupt the elections in Cali was 
discovered by the 3d Army Brigade. Meanwhile, the killing of two 
soldiers and wounding of six were the results of a clash between 
troops of the 12th Army Brigade and FARC (Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia) rebels in Guacamayas, San Vicente del Caguan 
(Caqueta). (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 29 May 94 p 
24A) 
  Three members of the Civil Registry Office in Cucuta who 
were 
kidnapped last Sunday by Army of National Liberation rebels were 
released last night. The three officials are safe and sound.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 30 
May. 
  Medellin police authorities have issued a communique 
explaining the bomb attack on 22 May at Atanasio Girardot 
Stadium in Medellin was not directed against the members of the 
German soccer team which played that day. General Luis Ernesto 
Gilibert Vargas, Medellin police commander, has said the 
terrorist attack was exclusively directed against the members of 
a police patrol who were going home after concluding their 
patrol duties at the stadium. Two policemen were killed, and 
two were wounded in the attack. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 25 May 94 p 8B) 
  Six guerrillas and an Army officer were killed and two

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 May (EFE) -- At least six 
people, including one policeman, one soldier, and a civilian, 
were killed today in three different guerrilla actions in 
Colombia, the day before the presidential elections. 
  At the same time the authorities decided to suspend 
elections 
in 12 small communities in the Simiti Municipality, Bolivar 
Department, in the northern Colombia, due to guerrilla threats. 
  A Defense Ministry source said that the most serious 
incident 
took place in a rural area known as Caguan, in southern 
Colombia, when a group of insurgents attacked and murdered a 
policeman, a soldier, and a woman. In this clash one of the 
rebels was killed. He belonged to the communist Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). 
  Near Baraya, in Huila Department, also in southern Colombia, 
a rebel was killed and two more were captured at a military 
checkpoint, when they tried to attack the troops. 
  The same source reported that in the Uraba area, in 
Colombia's northeast, the Army foiled an attack against a police 
garrison in Carepa, where one guerrilla was killed. 
  Electoral authorities decided to suspend elections in 12 
small communities in the Simiti Municipality. 
  Simiti Mayor Elias Escalante said that the decision to 
suspend the elections was made because the presence of 
guerrillas did not allow National Civil Registry (an 
organization in charge of the elections) delegates to go to 
these small communities. Simiti is located about 900 km north 
of Santa Fe de Bogota 
  Colombians will elect on Sunday President Cesar Gaviria's 
successor among 18 candidates, even though runoff elections on 
19 June will probably need to be held because it is unlikely any 
of the candidates will reach an absolute majority according to 
previous polls.

  [Text] The presidential elections are just getting started 
in Segovia, delayed by the mysterious disappearance of Damian 
Orlando Alvarez Cerna, municipal registrar. This occurred 
between last night and early today at that northeastern 
Antioquia mining site. Department and Segovia authorities, who 
fear that the official has been kidnapped, have reported that he 
was last seen early Saturday night. Today his apartment was 
found empty. 
  The authorities added that, around that same time, members 
of 
the outlawed National Army of Liberation [ELNN] raided the 
police post in the Fraguas community where they stole documents 
assigned to the two voting tables. Given these events, the 
department's Registry Office appointed two of its officials in 
Medellin, who were immediately transferred by a National Police 
helicopter. The two registrars, one of them [name indistinct], 
were granted special powers, while being supplied with 
additional documentation to replace what was stolen in Fraguas. 
Department Registrar Hector Arango Morales told Caracol that, 
despite the difficulties, the elections will be closed at 1600. 
To speed up the process the designated officials were given 
instructions to increase the 27 tables originally provided for 
in the urban areas and, if necessary, those of the rural areas. 
  Ruben Dario Jaramillo, Antioquia's ombudsman, joined the 
protests against what had occurred in Segovia, while urging 
those who have knowledge of Mr. Vasquez [name as heard] Cerna's 
whereabouts to respect the official's life and release him.
