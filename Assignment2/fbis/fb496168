  [Text] Quito, 28 May (EFE) -- The Maoist group "Inti 
Puka" ("Red Sun" in Quechua) that is similar to the Peruvian 
terrorist Shining Path movement claimed responsibility on 
Saturday, 28 May, for the [25 May] attack on an energy tower 
that left the water processing plant that supplies half the city 
of Quito without electricity. [see item PA2505201194 in previous 
Terrorism Report] 
  In anonymous telephone calls to local radio stations, 
persons 
who claimed to belong to the "Red Sun" said the attack is to 
protest the privatization plan implemented by the government of 
conservative Sixto Duran-Ballen. 
  The attack, with three dynamite charges, downed an energy 
tower in the outskirts of this city, leaving the Papallacta 
water processing plant without electricity. This plant provides 
water to almost half of Quito's 1.5 million inhabitants. 
  On several occasions civilian and military authorities have 
announced the dismantling of the "Red Sun," which has claimed 
responsibility for tens of bomb attacks in past years. Until 
now there have been no victims. 
  "We want to stress that we exist and that we will continue 
operating clandestinely against the government," one of the 
alleged terrorists who called the radio stations affirmed.

  [Excerpt] Jose Maria Monterrey, director of the National 
Civilian Police (PNC), has confirmed he has received death 
threats and that 15 days ago he was the target of an attempt on 
his life. 
  "These actions come from sectors that have yet to understand 
the role of the new society and the democracy being experienced 
in the country," Monterrey told LA PRENSA GRAFICA. Monterrey 
said that for the past 20 days he has been receiving threatening 
phone calls and communiques both at his office and home. He 
added that investigations are being conducted to find out who is 
responsible. 
  The PNC director said that some of the threats have already 
been carried out, indicating that 15 days ago he was the target 
of an attack from which he emerged unharmed. As a result of 
this, he has been forced to take security measures. "I have 
never in my life had to use bodyguards; I have never even been 
armed. Unfortunately, I will have to take some precautions so 
as not to ignore these threats," he added. 
  Monterrey said the PCN has acted firmly against kidnappers, 
drug traffickers, car theft gangs, and individuals who have been 
illegally using weapons, so some of these sectors might be 
responsible for the threats. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 1 
June. 
  A bomb exploded yesterday at 1800 near Channel 7's 
installations, hurling pamphlets of the Rebel Armed Forces with 
slogans against the Army and calling for the creation of the 
Truth Commission, an issue that is yet to be discussed at the 
negotiations table. The explosion caused no property damage but 
frightened people who were nearby. (Guatemala City SIGLO 
VEINTIUNO in Spanish 28 May 94 p 12) 
  National Police agents captured two guerrilla suspects; one 
near Maya neighborhood in Zone 18 and the other near the Guarda 
market in Zone 11. In the first case, the National Police's 
Public Relations office noted, the suspect was captured when 
several policemen were attacked by three individuals riding a 
blue Mitsubishi vehicle near the bus station in Maya 
neighborhood. The second suspect attracted the attention of the 
police because of his suspicious attitude. He was carrying a 
briefcase that contained three grenades. (Guatemala City 
SIGLOVEINTIUNO in Spanish 31 May 94 p 8)

  [Text] Guatemala City, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Unidentified 
individuals tonight detonated two bombs in different places in 
Guatemala City, according to the volunteer fire department. 
  The fire department chief, Emilio Najera, told NOTIMEX that 
one of the bombs exploded in front of the home of the brother of 
Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, bishop of Zacapa and the 
former mediator in negotiations between the government and the 
guerrillas. The second bomb went off at Climat, a store located 
in the exclusive Zone 9 of this capital. 
  Firemen did not specify the type of explosives used in the 
attacks, both of which caused considerable damage but no 
casualties. The attacks were carried out on the Day of 
Constitutionality, just 24 hours before the peace talks between 
the government and the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity 
(URNG) are due to resume in Mexico.

  [Text] Army spokeswoman Edith Vargas de Marroquin has 
blamed the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) for 
last night's bomb attacks against a shopping mall and the 
residence of Fernando Quezada Toruno. 
  The Army spokeswoman has said the guerrillas are the only 
ones capable of placing such bombs, which endanger the lives of 
the people, as what happened the night of 31 May when they 
exploded in the urban sector. 
  The explosions caused damage to Climat, a boutique located 
at 
No. 13-70 7th Avenue, Zone 9, and the residence of lawyer 
Fernando Quezada Toruno, the brother of Monsignor Rodolfo 
Quezada Toruno, president of the Civil Sectors Assembly. 
  The URNG could be responsible for the two bombs at the two 
locations, Government Minister Danilo Parrinello Blanco said 
yesterday. 
  We knew of a terrorist escalation, but we cannot ascertain 
the guerrillas are responsible for the bomb explosions, 
although, by logic, we can surmise they did it, the minister 
said. 
  There is no other reason to think this was an action by 
another group, but the investigations underway will confirm it, 
Parrinello Blanco concluded.

  [Text] A source of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) told 
EL PANAMA AMERICA yesterday that due to lack of evidence the 
Assistant Prosecutor's Office issued a precautionary measure 
[medida cautelar] in favor of the two Colombians arrested 
Thursday on suspicion of having participated in the attack on 
Jewish businessman Aaron Schwartz. [see previous Terrorism 
Report for full coverage of incident] 
  According to the source, after the situation of the 
Colombians was studied, they were freed because there was not 
enough evidence against them. Nevertheless, the two Colombians, 
whose names we omit because of the principle of presumption of 
innocence, are prohibited from leaving the country. These 
individuals told the Assistant Prosecutor's Office they were in 
Panama to buy automobiles. 
  On Thursday, the vehicle Schwartz was driving exploded and 
burned on Via Italia in the Paitilla neighborhood as a result of 
the explosion of a grenade connected to the front wheels of the 
vehicle. Schwartz suffered minor injuries to his arms and feet. 
  The Colombians were linked to the attack after an anonymous 
call reported their alleged participation in the incident. 
According to the source, the investigations have taken a new 
turn after data was gathered on the professionalism needed to 
place the grenade and the high cost of this type of work.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
media monitored through 26 May. 
  On 18 May, Army personnel killed Augusto Enrique Gutierrez, 
a 
Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, MRTA, member as he tried to 
escape. He and four other "suspicious persons" were arrested in 
the Centro Gavilan zone, Perene District, Chanchamayo Province, 
Junin Department. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 20 May 94 p A13) 
  Col. Eduardo Mendoza Rodriguez, chief of the Cajamarca 
Police 
Subregional Directorate, reported that on 19 May 15 repentant 
"terrorists" showed up at the Cajamarca Police headquarters. 
They operated in Cajabamba, Cajamarca, and San Marcos 
Provinces. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 21 May 94 p A12) 
  An Army infantry battalion has captured 23 Shining Path, SL, 
members of the so-called "Red Sea" column, including top 
leaders, who were trying to avoid capture in Upper Huallaga. 
The troops also arrested MRTA leader Hermenegildo Murillo 
Alejos, aka Comrade Alejos, who perpetrated many attacks in the 
Upper Huallaga and the Maranon Valley. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 22 May 94 p 54) 
  On 23 May SL "terrorists" kidnapped and tortured an Army 
soldier during a clash with a military patrol in the Pasto 
Grande village, Monzon District, Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco 
Department. His remains were found 12 hours later. The 30 SL 
"terrorists" who were captured on 5 April are being held at Los 
Laureles Army Unit. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 25 May 94 p A13) 
  Counterterrorism Directorate personnel arrested two SL 
"terrorists" identified as Diodoro Romero Quispe, 39, aka 
Gringo, and Marcelina Coro Silva, 37, aka Marcia. Their 
daughter confirmed that SL special command members met at their 
house to arrange for planting car bomb outside the Lima 
Prefecture and the U.S. Embassy. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 25 
May 94 p A14) 
  The SL "Red Sea" battalion ambushed a military patrol in 
Puerto Maria, 3 km from Cachicoto, Huamalies Province, Huanuco 
Department. A civilian guide was killed and two soldiers were 
seriously wounded. The Huallaga countersubversive front 
commander reported that the "subversive" battalion was 
reorganized and currently comprises 60 members. They are trying 
to recover the so-called Bolson Cuchara, the last SL stronghold 
in this part of the central jungle. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in 
Spanish 26 May 94 p 31) 
  The police arrested Clemencia Ramos, aka Comrade Maria, a 
member of the South-Medium SL regional committee, and two other 
alleged SL "subversives" in a downtown street of Huamanga, 
Ayacucho Department. She came to this city to reorganize local 
operations and carry out a wave of attacks on 18-19 June. (Lima 
EXPRESO in Spanish 26 May 94 p A11) 
  The Departmental Antiterrorism Division has arrested seven 
"terrorists" during operations in many shantytowns of El Callao. 
They perpetrated dynamite attacks against government 
institutions in Junin and Ayacucho Departments and in the 
central mountain range. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 26 May 94 p 
A11)

  [Text] The current Shining Path [SL] leadership is headed 
by several regional leaders, among them Oscar Ramirez Durand, 
aka "Feliciano," who has great influence but not absolute power, 
according to Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate]. 
  This information was granted by Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka 
"Albino," who was arrested a few days ago in Huacho together 
with other SL members whose identities have still not been 
revealed. "Albino," according to the Dincote spokesman, also 
disclosed that he had belonged to that elite SL group. 
  Tenorio Barbaran asserted that "Feliciano" is not the only 
leader of this unruly faction, but it has still not been 
determined who the other leaders of the group's so-called 
"collegiate presidency" are. 
  This SL faction is against the peace agreement upheld by 
Abimael Guzman Reinoso. 
  "Albino" also admitted having been a leader of the so-called 
North Zone Committee (Barranca-Huacho) and the intellectual 
author of attacks perpetrated by the SL in the zone between the 
years 1990- 93. 
  After being named a member of the SL Central Committee, he 
was invited to the capital to plan the attacks they would 
perpetrate. At that time he appeared in a video, together with 
Guzman, dancing Zorba the Greek. 
  Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, in his capacity as SL chief in the 
northern zone, shared the leadership with Daniel Angel Ramirez 
Martel, aka "Oscar," who was arrested last year together with 
another nine terrorists of the zone. 
  Between the years 1990 and 1993 they perpetrated some 30 
selective murders against mayors of different towns, policemen, 
civilians, an Air Force general, and three Japanese engineers. 
Among their victims are Air Force General Julian Olivera Angeles 
and the engineer Javier Puigross Planas.

    [Editorial Report] Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 
1994, pages 16 and 17, carries a 1700-word article dated 17 May 
by Eladio Arcaya who evaluates the armed strike ordered by the 
Shining Path, SL, to commemorate the 14th anniversary of its 
first "terrorist" action. 
  For the first time in 14 years, the people of the Upper 
Huallaga region did not obey the armed strike ordered by the SL. 
They went about their business as usual in the midst of an 
impressive deployment of combined police and Army security 
forces along the Marginal highway from Tingo Maria to Aucayacu. 
Officials ordered a curfew in Pucayacu from 2100 to 0600 after 
four people were murdered on 15 May by a SL unit that looted the 
town, taking food and medicine. The SL unit came from Upper 
Pucayacu where it has a camp. A military patrol with help from 
the population cleaned "subversive" slogans from the walls in 
Madre Mia. 
  The peasants no longer fear the armed strike and went to 
work 
the land. Others opened their businesses, took their children 
to school, and carried out their normal activities like any 
other day. 
  Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish on 18 May 1994, page 17, 
carries 
an unattributed 800-word article on the "total failure" of the 
SL armed strike ordered in Lima. The people paid no attention 
to the call and went to work as usual. Despite some cuts in the 
public transportation system because bus owners wanted to 
protect their units early in the morning, most Lima residents 
managed to get to work. Police and Army units patrolled roads 
and highways. Some "subversives" managed only to throw a few 
fire crackers. Security forces captured five "subversives" and 
confiscated weapons and explosives. In the San Juan de 
Lurigancho district, the Army provided buses to take passangers 
to the university campus. Early on the morning of 17 May a bomb 
exploded at the Interbanc branch in the San Martin de Porres 
district. On the same day at 1400, policemen of the Pachacutec 
Police Post arrested three alleged "terrorists" who reportedly 
murdered a woman who was selling fruit in the market of San Juan 
de Miraflores. The police found two 9 mm Browning pistols in 
their posession.

  [Text] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- Otilia Polay, mother of Victor 
Polay Campos, head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement 
(MRTA), today asserted that her son is subject to a prison 
regime that is "inhuman, and destructive to his physical and 
mental health." 
  Polay was sentenced to life imprisonment, which he is 
serving 
in a prison at the naval base of the port of Callao, where 
Shining Path [SL] leader Abimael Guzman is serving a similar 
sentence. 
  Otilia Polay voiced concern over her son's health, and said 
she was worried about the "physical deterioration and 
psychological strain" under which she found him during a visit 
she paid on 24 May. 
  Mrs. Polay added that this was the first time in 14 months 
she had been allowed to visit her son, whom she believed was 
"being illegally maintained in complete isolation, as according 
to the law he can be maintained in isolation for a maximum of 
one year." 
  Otilia Polay said her son told her he is completely isolated 
in a cell measuring two meters square with a skylight 15 
centimeters square, and that at night the very poor artificial 
light does not even allow him read the Bible, "the only book he 
is allowed to read." 
  She added that her son told her that for months he was 
allowed out into the daylight for only five minutes a day, and 
that now he is allowed 15 minutes a day "when according to the 
law he should be allowed 30 minutes." 
  The mother of the terrorist leader stated: "He is completely 
isolated and not allowed to speak to anybody." She said she 
believes that "the only purpose of all this is to destroy him 
physically and mentally with a system that violates minimum 
human rights." 
  Polay told his mother that Abimael Guzman and other SL 
leaders who are in the same prison "receive numerous visits, and

  Otilia Polay today held a news conference at the Democratic 
Constituent Congress (CCD), where she appeared to request an 
audience with the members of the Human Rights Commission to 
explain her son's situation and lodge a formal protest, she said.

  [Excerpts] Lima, 27 May (EFE) -- The video showing Shining 
Path leader Abimael Guzman, which police seized in 1991, still 
is delivering mortal blows to the movement: It has helped 
capture the current Shining Path "No. 2" leader, Felipe Tenorio. 
  In February 1991, police found a videocassette in a Lima 
house supposedly used as Guzman's hideout. In the video, Guzman 
could be seen imitating the dance shown in the film "Zorba, the 
Greek." 
  The video also showed the main Shining Path leaders close to 
Guzman. Among them was Felipe Tenorio Barbaran, aka "Augusto," 
who also was dancing with his chief, "President Gonzalo" as he 
is addressed by his followers. 
  On 26 May, Peruvian police publicly presented Tenorio to the 
country dressed in the striped uniform worn by arrested 
terrorists. Tenorio probably will be sentenced to life 
imprisonment. 
  According to police, "Augusto" was the "No. 2" man in the 
new 
Central Committee of the Peruvian Communist Party, which is the 
real name of the Maoist terrorist group. "Augusto" is second 
only to Oscar Ramirez Durand, aka "Feliciano," who is the 
current Shining Path leader. 
  "Feliciano" has been trying to reorganize the terrorist 
group 
since Abimael Guzman's arrest in Lima on 12 September 1992. 
Guzman was later sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  "Feliciano" has bluntly rejected Guzman's proposal to the 
Peruvian Government calling for a peace accord as well as his 
orders to suspend attacks and murders. [passage omitted] 
  As in Guzman's case, "Augusto" was arrested at a house in 
Los 
Olivos District, Lima, without having the chance to shoot a 
single shot. He had been one of terrorists most wanted by the 
National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote). [passage 
omitted]

reports on insurgent activities in Peru compiled from Peruvian 
press published through 18 May. 
  The Huallaga political military command issued an official 
communique stating that nine Shining Path, SL, "terrorists" who 
operated in Huanuco and San Martin Departments were arrested on 
6-10 May. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 13 May 94 p A10) 
  On 12 May, four repentant SL "subversives" were presented to 
the press. They were members of the main SL column. They carried 
out many attacks in Huacho, Huaura, Barranca, Huaral, Cajatambo, 
and Oyon. (Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 13 May 94 p A16) 
  On 13 May, an unknown number of SL "terrorists" attacked the 
Tocache airport, south of San Martin Department. Air Force 
officer Juan Nestor Asto Alfaro died in the attack. (Lima 
EXPRESO in Spanish 14 May 94 p A12) 
  Special Forces Division personnel on 13 May arrested 34 
alleged "terrorists" during a dragnet in the Felix Raucana 
shantytown in Lima. According to intelligence agents, Oscar 
Alberto Ramirez Durand, aka Feliciano, ordered the terrorist 
cells to resume activities in Felix Raucana, where the forces 
found "subversive" propaganda and documents. (Lima EXPRESO in 
Spanish 14 May 94 p A11) 
  On 13 May, heavily armed SL "terrorists" invaded the 
terminal 
of El Rapido Inc. company, where they overpowered 20 people. 
They hurled fire bombs at four buses but no one was injured. 
(Lima EL COMERCIO in Spanish 14 May 94 p A13)

  A column of 50 SL "terrorists" from the dismantled "Red Sea" 
battalion headed by Jose Picon Hilario, aka "El Manco," invaded 
the township of Pucayacu, where they killed two employees of the 
National Compensation and Social Development Fund. Repentant SL 
"terrorists" said El Manco has enough weapons and ammunition to 
continue attacking townships and military patrols. They noted

  [Text] Lima, 26 May (EFE) -- On 25 May the Peruvian Army 
concluded the antiterrorist offensive that began in April in the 
jungle zone of Leoncio Prado Province, Huanuco Department. [see 
item PY2605033494 in previous Terrorism Report] The Army 
qualified the operation as successful, despite accusations of 
having indiscriminately bombed the civilian population. 
  The military operation called Aries was aimed against the 
Shining Path [SL] members who operated in the area with two 
battalions known as Red Sea and Local Force which, according to 
military officers, were reduced by 40 percent in Huanuco. 
  The National Human Rights Coordinating Board claimed in 
April 
that during the military offensive civilians had been bombed and 
innocent people murdered, and that in one area about 50 people 
had been killed as a consequence of the excesses committed by 
the military. 
  Committees from several humanitarian organizations, and even 
from Congress, visited the Leoncio Prado region to verify the 
accusations, after which they said they had not found proof of 
bombings or massacres, although they did obtain some reports of 
human rights violations committed by the military. 
  The military chief of the zone, General Alfredo Rodriguez, 
reported at the end of the operation that the two terrorist 
battalions had been disbanded, and that the SL columns still 
remaining in the jungle zone north of Lima are out of contact, 
without provisions, and partially disarmed. 
  The general added that the Red Sea battalion was reduced to 
40 men, and that the Local Force members were disbanded. He 
added that Red Sea chief Jose Picon, aka Manco, and another 20 
SL members abandoned his group and hid in Monzon area. 
  Rodriguez said that the SL groups are trying to replenish 
their ranks with young men they kidnap from the different jungle 
towns and whom they force to join the SL ranks under threat of 
death. 
  The military chief considered the Aries operation to be 
successful, as "it has left the subversives with few weapons" 
and "a great deal of ammunition" was confiscated from them. 
  According to the military officer the terrorists are trying 
to reorganize themselves, for which reason the Peruvian military 
forces cordoned off the area to prevent them from doing so. 
  Gen. Rodriguez nonetheless pointed out that the ending of 
the 
Aries operation does not mean that the military have stopped 
exerting pressure in the area, because they must prevent the SL 
bases from reorganizing. 
  On 25 May the military high command presented to the media, 
at the Tingo Maria military base in Leoncio Prado Province, 23 
SL members captured during the operation, during which a total 
of 30 men were arrested. The military also showed to the media 
the weapons, explosives, medicines, communications equipment, 
documents, and propaganda material confiscated from the 
terrorists. 
  Gen. Rodriguez showed a copy book in which an SL member 
known 
as Comrade Angel had written an order to his comrades to 
"facilitate the access of the Red Cross to all the combat areas." 
  Gen. Rodriguez said he suspected that members of the Red 
Cross were informing the SL of Army movements, something which 
has not been proven.

    [Editorial Report] Lima EL PERUANO in Spanish on 18 May, 
pages A6-A7, carries an approximately 1,300 word unattributed 
report on the results of the "Aries" antiterrorist operation 
that began on 5 April in Huanuco, Leoncio Prado Province, which 
had become a narcoterrorist center. 
  The Huallaga Front command and the Armed Forces Joint 
command 
stepped up actions to destroy the most radical and bloodthirsty 
Shining Path, SL groups, namely the Peoples Guerrilla Army which 
basically comprises the "Mar Rojo" -- which has 300 members 
divided into three or more companies -- and the "Fuerza Local" 
battalions. 
  At the start of the operation there were 250 "terrorists" 
hiding in Huallaga, armed with North Korean AKM machine guns and 
RPG grenade launchers supplied by drug traffickers. Some 
repentant SL members said the "terrorists" had occupied some 
villages and formed "defense committees" using peasants as 
guides and shields. 
  Troops were dropped by helicopter a few kilometers from the 
SL groups so as to take them by surprise. The theater of 
operations includes the rural areas of Jose Crespo y Castillo 
and Rupa Rupa in Leoncio Prado. Pamphlets persuading named 
"terrorists" to surrender were distributed in nearby villages. 
Although this initiative did not persuade any SL leaders to 
surrender it encouraged civilians who for years have been forced 
to cooperate with the "terrorists" to hand themselves in. 
  Operations in the Huallaga Front this year have so far 
encouraged 500 "terrorists" to benefit from the repentance law, 
while another 2,500 are currently in the process of doing so. 
  The controversy stirred up by the Aries operation due to 
alleged human rights violations hindered the operation for six 
days, thus allowing the "terrorists" to regroup and escape the 
security forces cordon. One of the main leaders to flee was 
Jose Picon Hilario, aka El Manco who recently murdered two 
government officials in Pucayacu. 
  The Army has recovered many zones that were under SL 
dominance. For example the town of Bella, which was under SL 
dominance for the past 10 years, was recovered by security 
forces in September 1992. Since January, following the last SL 
attack that resulted in the death of 25 of its 300 inhabitants, 
Bella has not experienced any acts of violence. The same goes 
for Aucayacu, Naranjillo, Madre Mia, Uchiza, and Cueva de las 
Lechuzas, etc. 
  The SL has lost the corridor through Chiquian, the capital 
of 
Bolognesi Province, that was used by the "terrorists" to go from 
Huanuco to Pativilca. 
  Some 80 percent of the "terrorists" have been "eradicated" 
from Huallaga and the days are numbered for the remaining 20 
percent in the Cuchara, Primavera, and Yanajanca regions, and a 
new region that includes the Quillaymarca River bank and Santa 
Marta in Maranon Province.

<F P=106> [DESCO Special Report No 35: "Political Violence in Peru </F>
Today," issued by Peru's Center for Development Studies and 
Promotion (DESCO)] 
  [Text] During March 1994 political violence increased 
slightly, compared to the months of January and February. There 
were 43 attacks on persons, or 10 percent more than in January 
(when there were 34) and February (when there were 32). 
Fortunately, there was a considerable decrease in the number of 
persons killed. The attacks in March caused 17 deaths. Twelve 
involved presumed subversives, four were civilians, and one was 
a member of the armed forces. 
  Lima continued to be the area where the largest number of 
subversive actions took place. A total of 27 (63 percent) of the 
attacks took place here. In March two periods of time were 
preferred for subversive activity: the middle and the end of the 
month. Shining Path [SL] carried out two waves of attacks, 
including a series which took place during two weeks in the 
middle of March as part of a "subversive celebration" to 
commemorate two anniversaries: the attack on the CRAS [Social 
Rehabilitation Center--after prison training center] in Ayacucho 
and the establishment of Socorro Popular [People's Assistance 
Organization, the SL equivalent of the Red Cross]. The wave of 
attacks which took place during the last few days of March 
involved a series of actions in anticipation of the anniversary 
of the coup d'etat of 5 April. 
  Most of the attacks in Lima involved acts of sabotage 
against 
branch banks, supermarkets, and high voltage electricity pylons. 
However, the most serious action involved the detonation of a 
tricycle bomb in the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist. 
  In second place in terms of acts of political violence was a 
three-way tie between the subversives' Principal, Norte, and 
Centro [Principal, North, and Center] regions. Four attacks (9 
percent of the total) took place in each region. 
  In the Principal region there were three raids on towns in 
the Province of Acobamba and an act of terror in the Province of 
Huancasancos in which the governor of the province was wounded. 
  In the Norte region subversives attacked the local 
headquarters of a company which repairs highways, murdered a 
local official, and incited a mob to lynch a group of farmers. 
Finally, two members of the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement] were captured when they attempted to break into a 
house. 
  In the Centro region there were two clashes, one of them 
initiated by the Army and the other by indigenous people of the 
Ashaninka tribe. At the same time subversives sabotaged electric 
lines in the Valle del Mantaro area. 
  In third and last place a tie was also recorded between the 
Regional Committees of La Selva and Sur, with two attacks each 
(5 percent of the total). 
  In La Selva region there was a clash and a deliberately 
targeted murder, whereas in the Sur region there was also a 
clash in Orurillo, Province of Puno. The subversives detonated 
explosives against a special project. 
  Regarding persons killed, the leading area was the Centro 
region, with 13 persons killed (72 percent of the total). These 
figures include subversive deaths in clashes with the security 
forces and with a group of indigenous people of the Ashaninka 
tribe. 
  In second place as far as persons killed are concerned were 
the Lima and La Selva regions, with two each (11 percent of the 
total). The two civilians killed in Lima died in the attack on 
the home of Patricio Ricketts, a journalist, while in La Selva 
region a sergeant in the Army died in a clash with subversives 
and a farmer was murdered for not paying taxes levied by the SL. 
  Finally, in last place in terms of persons killed was the 
Norte region, with one person dead (six percent of the total). 
This was the murder of the mayor of Huaylillas, in the Province 
of Pataz. 
<H5>  Persons Killed by SL Region in March 1994 </H5>
  Centro: 71 percent 
  Lima: 12 percent 
  La Selva: 12 percent 
  Norte: 6 percent 
<H5>  Persons Killed and Attacks by SL Region in March 1994 </H5>
  Lima: 2 civilians killed for total of 2; 26 attacks.

<F P=106> [Article by Juan de la Fuente Mejia, economist and expert on </F>
violence in the Huallaga Valley: "It Is Still Night in Huallaga"] 
  [Text] This article is part of a study that the Council of 
Projects for Latin American Refugees (CPRL) conducted between 
October and December of last year on forced relocations in the 
Upper Huallaga and Huanuco. It has observed from the Upper 
Huallaga that Shining Path (SL), far from being annihilated, is 
relocating to the provinces of Huanuco and Ucayali and to the 
Central Jungle. Since January, there have been several news 
reports of another relocation into the provinces of San Martin 
in the Mayo River Basin. Attacks on towns, executions of mayors 
and teachers, bloody ambushes, the shutdown of Huanuco 
university, and a great many disappearances tell us that the 
post-Shining Path era is a long way off there. 
  Several small children are playing war at six in the evening 
on a street in now deserted Uchiza. Most want to be the "firma" 
(the cocaine mafia); others want to be "cumpas" (Shining Path) 
or "colochos" (Colombians). The littlest one complains that he 
does not want to be the "moroco" or army but he has to if he 
wants to play. 
  It seems that Abimael Guzman is playing a very weak hand in 
the Upper Huallaga and in the Department of Huanuco, but at the 
same time there are few signs that Shining Path is vanishing. At 
worst, a respite would diminish uncertainties. This would 
presumably be the last great Shining Path battlefront, where the 
ultimate outcome of this 14-year-old war would be played out. 
  The regional committee in the Upper Huallaga was never just 
another committee. Its establishment was a victory for the 
so-called "black line," spearheaded by Osman Morote, that 
opposed Abimael Guzman. Guzman did not want SL to move into an 
area that he regarded as a "rotten territory" which could easily 
contaminate his cadres and would be taken over only after SL 
controlled much of the country. At the Central Committee plenum 
that debated the issue, Guzman reportedly said that "the Indians 
will never understand Gonzalo's thoughts." The internal 
opposition retorted that this is what the "five golden rules" 
were for and that the party should not throw away the 
opportunities offered by the jungle. 
  This is why its existence was always a challenge to 
"Chairman 
Gonzalo's" authority and one of the reasons, aside from the 
historical ones, why it did not become the Main Regional 
Committee. 
  The valley had its advantages. It was the area with the 
fastest growth, the territory in which SL conducted its 
principal experiments. The first "armed work stoppages" were 
decreed there, later to be conducted nationwide. The forms of 
organization for the "liberated zones" spread throughout its 
vast expanses between 1987 and 1990. SL did not even dream of 
trying these forms, which were developed according to theory and 
corrected in practice (such as the town delegates and the open 
grass-roots committees), in Lima and other cities. 
  It was General Arciniega who altered the course of the war 
in 
the Huallaga Valley. He radically changed the strategy followed 
until then, which regarded SL, drug traffickers, and the 
peasants who grew coca leaves as a single military target, and 
he vied with SL for peasant grassroots support; he stopped 
cracking down on coca growing and tried to restore the people's 
trust in the military through assistance efforts. 
  These were not the only changes. When Arciniega assumed 
command of the Huallaga Front in 1989 after SL's bloody takeover 
of Uchiza, he shifted the center of operations from the north 
(Tarapoto, Juanjui, and the Mayo River) to the south, to the 
provinces of Mariscal Caceres (San Martin) and Leoncio Prado 
(Huanuco) in the Upper Huallaga. 
  His successors, Generals Chacon, Brito, and Hanke, moved the 
hub of operations back to its former location and made the 
crackdown on the MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] a 
priority. The upshot was a stronger SL that expanded into the 
province of Padre Abad (Ucayali), which borders the Huallaga. 
  In 1993, when it was certain that the MRTA had been broken 
up, the Huallaga Front moved its center of operations southward 
for the second time, whereupon it became obvious that SL was 
feeling the blows and starting to withdraw in several directions. 
  Its first move was towards the interior. Resigned to the 
fact 
that the blows to its "territorial networks" would be crushing, 
SL chose to shift its "mobile networks," that is to say, the 
units of the People's Guerrilla Army (EGP), into the jungle. 
  The other two moves have not represented much of an exodus, 
being more a combination of withdrawal and deployment. On the 
one hand, it has moved into the other provinces in the 
Department of Huanuco and, from there, via corridors, to La 
Libertad and Ancash; on the other, it has moved into the central 
jungle through Puerto Inca, Puerto Bermudez, and Codo del Pozuzo. 
  There were several reasons for this initial movement. First, 
the coca market crash has made the civilian population and the 
growers less dependent on SL. The chain reaction from this 
crisis pushed many of the social and economic players who had 
previously sought SL's help out of the area and left it with a 
smaller civilian population to vie for. Local observers note 
that paradoxically it would seem to be coca, rather than the 
army, that is getting the best of Shining Path. 
  The countryside is becoming depopulated through emigration. 
Most of the families that were lured by the coca boom to the 
valley from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin, and Ucayali in the 1970's and 
1980's are going home. 
  Second, the aforementioned southward shift of the center of 
military operations is putting pressure on SL and forcing it to 
relocate further away from towns. 
  Third, the Armed Forces are following a somewhat different 
strategy vis-a-vis the civilian population: less of a presence 
in cities and medium-sized towns (Tingo Maria, Aucayacu, 
Tocache, and Uchiza) and a stronger role in rural areas and 
smaller towns, including civic action programs. 
  The role that the patrols played in defeating SL in the 
central highlands is not the same as in the Upper Huallaga. They 
are not very widespread there, and the army is having serious 
trouble organizing them. In the central highlands the patrols 
were formed using the structure of the peasant communities, 
which had to defend territory, internal democracy, and crops, 
among other things. 
  There are very few communities in the Huallaga, but another 
factor is even more significant: migration has made the area 
cosmopolitan, and owing to this development, combined with the 
weak sense of order and democracy and the coca market crash, the 
locals are uninterested in defending what they really do not 
possess or have ceased to possess. 
<H5>  Yankee Go Home </H5>
  The old red graffiti can still be seen along the road from 
Tingo Maria to Tocache. They are from 1989-90: "Long live the 
MLM," "Yankee Go Home," "Long Live Chairman Gonzalo," "Finish 
Off the Great Leap With a Gold Seal." None refers to "defending 
the life of Chairman Gonzalo" or some other current issue. 
Shining Path is not doing graffiti anymore today, nor is it 
operating checkpoints along roads, nor does it control the 
small, remote coca-growing towns. Its favorite tactics are 
ambushes, executions, and a few raids into small towns. During 
the first 10 months of 1993 its ambushes alone took the lives of 
24 army personnel. 
  It would be a mistake to conclude that SL does not retain 
some of its military reserves. The "main force," which the army 
itself estimated at 3,000 men, plus the "local forces" and the 
"base forces," totaled more than 6,000 men in 1989. Estimates 
are that these forces have declined by 80 percent over the last 
two years as a result of arrests, battles, desertions, and 
surrenders of reformed SL members. This means that SL would 
currently be able to mobilize 1,200 men, still a potent force. 
<H5>  Huanuco: Leave or Die </H5>
  There are no graffiti, either new or old, in Huanuco, except 
for a few at the university. The SL's do not seem to do that 
kind of thing there. But a great many people have been killed. 
Four university professors, two students, and the woman 
president of the mothers clubs have been slain in less than one 
year. A student and a leader of the SUTEP [Trade Union of 
Education Workers] were severely wounded. SL does allow itself 
certain luxuries there, such as its ambush of a patrol car in 
the downtown section of the city last September. 
  Since the SL regional committee in the Upper Huallaga 
decided 
in early 1992 to no longer consider Huanuco a transit point and 
temporary haven, the search for new "support bases" in the once 
placid city has turned violent. 
  Gonzalo's "red line" was in the majority until September of 
last year; its goal was to clear out the political scene until 
only it and the State remained as adversaries. This faction was 
presumably responsible for the attacks of recent years and 
executed about one well-known public figure a month. The capture 
of an SL commando group in the city of Huanuco last August was 
reportedly a severe blow to the Gonzalo faction, leaving it in 
the minority. 
  The other faction seeks to focus on government 
representatives. Its main goal is to pursue the tactics of the 
war of national liberation, which characterizes the faction of 
Osman Morote or the "former opposition" in the area. 
  Hermilio Valdizan University is reportedly the center of SL 
activity. Its objective seems to be to recruit and train cadres, 
using the university as a springboard for subsequent development 
in the slums. Whoever opposes this approach has two options: 
leave or die. Ten professors have left in response to threats, 
among them the former president of the region, Andres Avelino 
Caceres, and the dean of the Department of Administrative 
Sciences, Julio Tarazona Padilla, as well as the former 
president of the teachers union, Ruben Sachun, and the former 
president of the Women's Network, Denessy Palacios, among others. 
  Recent raids into the towns of Tantamayo and Monzon in 
September suggest that SL has again occupied the northern 
corridor of the Huanuco highlands, which it used from 1983 to 
1988, its years of expansion. Supporting this deduction is the 
fact that the column which attacked Monzon (40 to 50 men in poor 
shape, with neither food nor clothing, with few supplies, many 
of them suffering from leishmaniasis) is the same one that 
raided Tantamayo. 
  This corridor extends into the Department of Ancash and 
presumably enables SL to help out its organizations in Huaraz 
and northern Peru, to remove its wounded, and to obtain 
supplies. In addition, it is probably using the corridor that 
runs from Uchiza through Tayobamba and Huacrachuco to La 
Libertad. 
<H5>  Ayacucho, Again and Again </H5>
  Manuel Milla Pinzas, a former dean of the Bar Association 
and 
university professor, was killed by an SL commando group at the 
gate to the university campus at five in the afternoon last 4 
October. One-hundred meters away is the Cayhuayna police 
checkpoint, where there were more than 20 agents and one van. 
The commando group fled on foot towards Paucarbamba and vanished 
from sight 10 minutes later. Rosa del Aguila, the president of 
the Federation of Mothers Clubs, was slain two months before 
near Calicanto Bridge. She called for help and fought with her 
assailants, who left on foot, watched by two policemen standing 
guard at the gate to the headquarters of the Technical 
Police...less than 100 meters from the scene of the crime. 
Ayacucho 1980? Lima 1992? No. Huanuco in recent months. 
  Several mistakes in the strategy to combat subversion could 
have negative repercussions in the short term. In fact, they 
already have. Residents of the city are obviously jumpy, and the 
exodus of people could be followed by a withdrawal of the 
investments that have been trickling in for the past two years. 
  The military commands have allowed SL to start retreating 
into the provinces in the Huanuco highlands and into the city 
itself and to use the Huamalies and Huacrachuco corridors 
without much difficulty. 
  The Achilles' heel of the battle against subversion is the 
civilian population. In light of the difficulties it has had in 
organizing the patrols, the military command is resorting to 
territorial control, assistance, then neglect, and so on. But it 
does not stop at exclusion; it also cracks down. It would seem 
that beyond the sweeps, the mass control of the disadvantaged 
population, and whatever arrests it may make, the army has 
little to fall back on. 
  Over the past two years Huanuco has been the department with 
the most arrests and missing persons. The Human Rights 
Commission of the Constitutional Congress reported recently that 
in 1992 there were 144 disappearances, 132 of which are blamed 
on the army. 
  In 1993 there were 89 complaints filed, 32 in relation to 
army actions. From January to August of last year alone, the 
Ombudsman's Unit of the Attorney General's Office documented 38 
missing person reports, most of them implicating troops from 
"Los Laureles" barracks in Tingo Maria. The problems are 
mounting because neither Tingo Maria nor Huanuco has a human 
rights commission. 
  Other key words for the Upper Huallaga and Huanuco that 
neither the government nor the military seem to understand are 
"development" and "social support." In a region in which the 
State has been clueless for the past 15 years and in which the 
absence of democracy is as obvious as the lack of jobs, markets, 
investment, education, and health care, the mildest 
antigovernment rhetoric will clearly work. 
  The strategy to combat subversion should take into account 
that the clearer the decline in the SL threat becomes, the more 
the State will again be the main target of discontent. A long 
list of problems persists in the Huanuco jungle and highlands: 
towns without electric power, communities in which 80 percent of 
the children suffer from leishmaniasis, villages without 
schools, harvests that cannot be taken to market because there 
are no roads, crops attacked by pests and blights, producers who 
cannot get loans, growers who want aid to replace their coca 
crops, people without jobs, displaced persons without homes, 
work, or hope. The National Compensation and Social Development 
Fund is not enough. What is needed is public and private 
investment, credit, an expansion of the agricultural frontier, 
and the promotion of output and jobs. 
  Expanded assistance is oh so far away from the Huallaga and 
Huanuco! 
<H5>  [Box, p 41] </H5>
<H5>  The Guerrillas Wear Blue Jeans </H5>
  The members of Shining Path in the Upper Huallaga are more 
cosmopolitan and frivolous and less ideological. Unlike the 
militant Maoists from Ayacucho, the SL people in the Huallaga 
have little political and ideological motivation. 
  We should bear in mind that the area does not have a 
tradition of political confrontation (which Ayacucho does), nor 
is there a deeply rooted political culture, nor are there elites 
or parties that are even halfway organized. So, during SL's peak 
years you could see militiamen and activists wearing blue jeans, 
hush puppies, and University of Oklahoma sweatshirts, something 
that would have been unlikely in other areas, even the hot ones. 
  SL has gained little from its 10 years in the valley. Unlike 
in the highlands and the Andes, it built its relations with the 
people in the Huallaga Valley on the defense of coca growing, 
not on the assertion of any ideology. 
  This link is becoming weaker and weaker, because there are 
fewer coca crops and less drug trafficking, which will likely 
wind up being insignificant. The reason for its success will 
eventually turn out to be the reason for its failure. In the 
long run, the coca growers and gangland kingpins will wind up 
using Gonzalo's men. Perhaps this is why Abimael Guzman, who is 
not much of a populist, opposed the opening of this front, 
inasmuch as a future alliance with Huallaga society did not 
depend on his forces. 
  But what is easily conquered is easily lost as well. None of 
the mass organization arrangements that SL developed is working 
today: neither the grass-roots committees nor the militias nor 
the groups they created. In a place where it was very easy to 
move from being a small-time trafficker to a militiaman or from 
being a coca grower (or else a producer of cocaine paste) to a 
delegate, it is also very simple to return to one's former 
activity, or to emigrate. 
  These factors are also affecting SL. Most of its members no 
longer want to be involved in the war. They are fleeing, 
preferring not to become reformed terrorists. Some come to Lima, 
others to Pucallpa and from there to Brazil, to Manaus or 
Cruzeiro, where SL's, MRTA members, grass-roots leaders, and 
peasants accused of terrorism have gathered to live. The more 
than 100 members who turned themselves in in January were 
probably not commanders or activists; they were likely residents 
of the former support bases, militiamen, or collaborators with 
the organizations they created. 
  SL is presumably trying to follow the coca route or move 
alongside it. This is the reason for the attack on the 
Ashaninkas, which was probably an attempt to clean out the area. 
Everyone knows that coca is moving east and south, from Puerto 
Inca to the central jungle. The Codo del Pozuzo, which was once 
a ranching paradise, is part of the new scene of the coca-SL-war 
symbiosis. In the jungle SL is fated to wander around after the 
coca growers and drug traffickers from valley to valley, no 
longer as a political and military force that aspires to take 
over the country but as part of an apparatus that protects the 
former from the State. 
<H5>  [Box, p 32] </H5>
<H5>  The Long Tocache March </H5>
  Driven by the need for territorial domination, Shining Path 
structured the life of the drug traffickers and each of their 
"firms." It did so as only it knows how. One fine day it issued 
a decree, the most noteworthy points in which were: 
  a. Cocaine is for overseas consumption, and domestic use is 
punished. The watchword was: "The spider does not consume its 
own poison." 
  b. Defend the right to plant coca shrubs and to work and 
prevent the eradication projects from destroying the crops. The 
watchword: "Yankee Go Home." 
  c. The "firms" could not have more than four foreigners. The 
purpose of this was to stem the invasion of Colombians and stave 
off their violent activities. They stated that Colombian men 
married to Peruvian women would be given preference in remaining 
here. 
  d. The "traqueteros" (the people who drove through towns and 
along roads on motorcycles buying the packages of cocaine paste) 
had to be Peruvian. 
  e. All sales and "flights" (shipments of cocaine paste to 
Colombia) had to be carried out in the presence of the SL 
delegate. The slogan: "The Party has a thousand eyes and a 
thousand ears." 
  Many people's disbelief was dispelled when, two weeks after 
SL issued its "edict," it dragged four Colombians out of the 
"Porkis" discotheque in Uchiza and slit their throats. 
  SL's first advance guards arrived in the valley seeking jobs 
as coca harvesting laborers, the lowest rung on the coca ladder. 
During the first stage, from 1983 to late 1984, Shining Path 
focused on emphasizing its message to the people (the tactic of 
developing bases). In July 1984 an emergency was declared in the 
zone, and the military crackdown forced SL to retreat. The 
military campaign, which did not distinguish between targets, 
helped to bolster its ties with the civilian population. SL did 
not waste the opportunity and took charge of administering 
justice and daily life in the mid-sized towns that were 
flourishing because of coca and coca-dollars. It dealt with 
marital conflicts and land disputes and enforced penalties for 
minor offenses. Theirs was not a public takeover but rather a 
surreptitious presence in civil society, a silent alliance in 
which at that time SL was the major beneficiary. 
  The second stage, from 1987 to 1991, was marked by SL's 
intensive and extensive deployment. During it SL scored its 
biggest successes. It dealt head-on blows to the State and 
easily took over towns, causing the police to flee from many 
spots, never to return; it set up checkpoints on roads and 
charged tolls to enter certain towns. 
  SL was able to move in rapidly because its advance guards 
were not the first to shatter law and order in the Upper 
Huallaga. When they arrived, people in the Peruvian jungle did 
not ask who was armed but instead who was not. 
  The local "mafias" had been armed since the mid-1970's, 
first 
to defend themselves against gangs of assailants and later to 
enforce the law of silence by assassinating mayors, governors, 
and newsmen. When Gonzalo's hosts arrived, many of the towns 
scattered about the valley had no authorities, and the locals 
lived in fear of abuses by the "mafias." 
  The jungle needed its own brand of law and order, and SL was 
the right policeman for the job. "Coca" and "cocaine," not 
"eradication," enjoyed the broadest consensus in the zone. In 
keeping with the classic literary theme, SL sold its soul 
(ideology) for life (territory). The key word in this alliance 
was not "socialism," "equality," or "revolution," but rather 
"protection." It was the only SL front in which ideology did not 
come first and foremost. 
  SL gained nothing other than the physical territory that it 
controlled and the social oversight that it exercised. It could 
never command the economy, and the only time that it tried to, 
in 1988 when it decreed a strike in Uchiza and outlawed the coca 
harvest and the sale of cocaine paste, it met with defeat when 
the coca market shifted to the Lower Huallaga and the peasants 
rioted.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Four Items on Velayati's Agenda </F>
During His Visit to Baghdad"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Tehran 
announced yesterday that Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati has accepted an invitation to visit Iraq early next 
month. 
  Velayati, who will be the first Iranian minister to visit 
Iraq since 1978, is expected to discuss "an important and deep 
change in bilateral relations," according to sources in Tehran. 
  The agenda will include four issues: 
  To achieve a phased settlement to the dispute over the Shatt 
al-'Arab waterway on the basis of the 1975 Algiers agreement. 
To coordinate to prevent the establishment of a 
semi-independent Kurdish state in north Iraq. Iran reached a 
separate agreement with Turkey on this issue, while Syria 
announced its commitment to Iraq's territorial integrity. To 
agree on a joint policy against Washington, and the two sides 
will work to set up a broader grouping that could include 
Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, and Libya; it could also include Qatar. 
To embark on a joint economic action to ease the effects of the 
UN sanctions imposed on Iraq, without violating the Security 
Council resolutions. Iran is already allowing the delivery to 
Iraq of huge quantities of food supplies, medicine, and 
"durable" commodities through operations across the border. 
  But there are several sources of tension in relations 
between 
Tehran and Baghdad; most importantly, either side is financing 
and supporting the exiled groups opposed to the other. The 
arrest recently of two people in Tehran on the pretext that they 
are Iraqi intelligence officers is an indication that the two 
sides are continuing the hostile operations which were 
originally designed during the eight-year war between the two 
countries. 
  Iraq is sheltering and financing several Iranian opposition 
groups, including the Mojahedin-e Khalq, the Kurdish Democratic 
Party [of Iran], and several Baluch groups. While Iran is 
supporting Shiite Iraqi organizations fighting the Baghdad 
regime.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ron Ben-Yishay: "The IDF Is Taking an </F>
Aggressive Approach"] 
  [Text] Yesterday's attack by Israel Air Force [IAF] jets 
against a Hizballah training base in Lebanon's al-Biqa' was the 
strongest blow dealt to the organization in the past eight years. 
  Even before they had time to recover from the abduction of 
Mustafa al-Dirani, the leaders of the Hizballah lost dozens of 
their youngest fighters in the heart of their "security zone" in 
al-Biqa', under the nose of the Syrians and their antiaircraft 
missiles. 
  The two latest actions reflect a new, far more aggressive, 
approach recently adopted by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] 
against hostile elements in Lebanon with the government's 
approval. In light of the deadlock in the negotiations with 
Syria, Israel has no reason to show the restraint and passivity 
which have characterized the IDF's activity in Lebanon until now. 
  In the absence of a better response, Hizballah resorted to 
the familiar: launching katyusha rockets at towns in the 
Galilee. Judging from experience, this is not the last word. 
One can safely assume not only additional katyusha volleys over 
the next few days but also a concentrated effort by Hizballah to 
attack IDF and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts and patrols in 
the security zone. There may be also be attempts to kidnap SLA 
and IDF soldiers. The situation may deteriorate in a way 
similar to the exacerbation which preceded Operation 
Accountability [July 1993]. 
  The difference is that this time, the IDF is taking the 
initiative while the Hizballah is only reacting, to a large 
extent out of helplessness. Another difference is the 
increasing effectiveness of the IDF offensives. 
  The IAF attacked dozens of times in Lebanon in recent years; 
however, in only rare cases has it managed to inflict a real 
blow on the terrorist organizations. Most of the benefit of 
these air raids lay in their deterrent effect and in their 
disruption of preparations for terrorist operations. Now, the 
fighting capabilities of the fundamentalist organization are 
increasingly being undermined. 
  Judging from recent operations, the IDF has acquired some 
intelligence information which enables it to strike at the root 
of the problem; or in other words, Hizballah's fighting corps. 
One can also discern an improvement in the IAF's capability to 
carry out surprise attacks against distant targets, despite the 
threats along the way (Syrian antiaircraft fire). This 
improvement in the IDF's "long arm" enables it to refrain from 
striking at the civilian populace which supports Hizballah, as 
was the case in the past. 
  Yesterday's IDF operation did not violate the understandings 
reached in the wake of Operation Accountability in July 1993. 
The target attacked, 'Ayn Zarzarah, was not a village but a 
major Hizballah training base several kilometers from the Syrian 
border. In any case, it does not matter whether or not Israel 
violated the understandings. Hizballah cannot allow itself not 
to retaliate against the recent attacks. The question is which 
form this reaction will take, and how powerful will it be. It 
will also serve as a test for the new Israeli strategy. If the 
reaction is tolerable, and does not lead to a serious 
exacerbation, then the Israeli gamble has paid off and the 
recent operations have achieved their goal. But if we again 
find ourselves in a situation where Israel has to ask the 
Americans to mediate for a cease fire, with the help of Syria, 
then both the gamble and the new strategy have failed.

  [Text] Beirut, June 3 (AFP)--Tens of thousands of angry 
mourners took part in funeral ceremonies in Beirut and around 
Lebanon on Friday for up to 45 Hizballah guerrillas killed in a 
devastating Israeli air raid. 
  Hizballah Secretary General Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah told an 
estimated 20,000 people in Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern 
suburbs: "The (anti-Israeli) Islamic Resistance has been born 
anew." [passage omitted] 
  Shaykh Nabil Qa'uq, a Hizballah official, said Hizballah was 
determined to "strike Israel anywhere and at any time." [passage 
omitted] 
  The Iranian-backed group said 26 guerrillas were killed in 
the raid and 40 others wounded. But Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz put the death toll at 45 while hospital officials 
in the al- Biqa' said 85 were wounded.

  [Text] Beirut, June 2 (AFP) -- The Iranian-backed Hizballah 
vowed to fight the Jewish state "on all fronts" after Israeli 
warplanes killed at least 45 guerrillas in a devastating raid on 
Thursday. 
  "From now on the battle with Israel is open on all fronts," 
Hizballah spiritual leader, Shaykh Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, 
said in a statement. 
  "It's the biggest challenge ever. Moslems, the mujahidin and 
the oppressed have decided there is no place for Israel among 
us. The forces of world oppression will no longer have a say in 
our region," Fadlallah said. 
  "Israel and the forces of world oppression can win several 
rounds but satans big or small trying to devour us will not 
frighten us," he added. 
  Fadlallah described the United States as a "wolf which 
devours man, peace and life." 
  "We know that every shell and every Israeli warplane is in 
fact an American shell and an American warplane," he said.

  [Text] On the basis of a circular issued by President 'Ali 
Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, anyone trying to smuggle foreign 
currency out of the country will be identified and handed over 
to the judicial authority for punishment. 
  During a news conference today, Intelligence Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Fallahian said: Since implementation of the new policy on 
foreign currency, eight gangs involved in the illegal purchase, 
accumulation, and smuggling of hard currency abroad have been 
arrested and handed over to the judicial officials. 
  Referring to Iraqi provocations to create terror inside 
Iran, 
he said: During the past four months, the Iraqi Ba'thist 
regime, in pursuit of its particular objectives, has exported 
some sabotage networks [gangs] and has resorted to planting 
bombs in Iran, in particular. However, thanks to efforts of the 
intelligence forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, two 
high-ranking Iraqi intelligence officers have been arrested 
inside our country. He added: These two intelligence officers, 
named Ra'd Mustafa Fattah and Arkan 'Abd al-Amir 'Ali, have 
confessed to their mission, including the import of explosives 
to Iran. 
  The intelligence minister pointed out: Four Iranians who 
have been cooperating with the Iraqi intelligence officers have 
been arrested and have confessed that they were involved in 
intelligence work. 
  Stressing that the Iraqi regime intends to depict our 
country 
as insecure by detonating bombs in Iran, Mr. Fallahian went on: 
During the past four months, 22 bombs have been imported into 
the country by Iraqi elements. In addition to the arrest of the 
above people, 14 bombs have been discovered. 
  About the latest investigations on the discovery of a 
microphone in our country's London Embassy, the intelligence 
minister said: The dimensions of this espionage affair is not 
limited to the discovery of a microphone alone, and we have not 
divulged all of the issues yet. A country's embassy is regarded 
as its territory in accordance with international regulations, 
and they have violated our sovereignty while the British press 
unanimously presents the issue as a normal occurrence. 
  Another issue mentioned by the intelligence minister was the 
return of the Iranians living abroad. He said: Iranians living 
abroad can take advantage of the facilities we have provided for 
them. 
  About the plot to assassinate the President on 1 February 
1994, marking the anniversary of Khomeyni's return to Iran, 
Intelligence Minister Fallahian said: Investigations on this 
matter are still continuing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F>
the Hamas Movement, by Samih al-Ma'ayitah in Damascus -- date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] Al-Ma'ayitah: The topical issue is 
how Hamas will deal with the self-rule authority. The Movement 
has to choose between confrontation, understanding, or a truce. 
What option have the Movement's bodies adopted? 
  Ghawshah: This issue is complex and wide-ranging. 
I will try to discuss the basic topics dealing with it. First, 
let us say that the stage of theorization about what stand Hamas 
will adopt if the Palestinian authority is imposed and the 
Palestinian police enters the self-rule areas is over. All the 
Palestinian forces, those who supported or opposed the peace 
process which started in Madrid and ended with the Cairo 
agreement are now treading on a minefield. They all should think 
before taking any step to avoid an explosion that would destroy 
everything. Hamas has taken measures to counter this stage. 
The Hamas Movement has resorted to all that is in its power to 
confront the march of capitulation which began in Madrid, and 
succeeded in obstructing and delaying this march. There is a 
mighty force behind this process, represented by the United 
States, the Zionist forces, and the regimes loyal to them, and 
these forces succeded in imposing the Cairo and Oslo agreement 
on the Palestinian people. The hands of the clock cannot be set 
back, but we can make proposals that would prevent the explosion 
and at least limit the losses. We in the Hamas Movement 
approach the Palestinian authority and the police force with 
caution. We will judge them on the basis of their deeds and 
not their words, especially sweet talk which is rife at the 
present time. We believe that avoiding confrontation is a 
national and religious duty by which all should abide. 
  The Hamas Movement has translated this into a political 
stand 
and decision not to confront the Palestinian authority and 
police force. We will deal with them in a civilized and peaceful 
manner by highlighting the mistakes, secrets, and loopholes in 
the Cairo and Oslo agreements and mobilizing the masses and 
forces in and outside the territories to reject this agreement 
and foil it with civilized methods. This is the stand of the 
Palestinian opposition, represented in the Alliance of 
Palestinian Forces. The Palestinian police force is part of the 
Palestinian people. Most of its members are from the Palestine 
Liberation Army [PLA] and had fought the Zionists in many 
places, particularly in Lebanon during the Zionist invasion of 
that country. We are fully convinced and we know that this 
police force has decided not to confront the Palestinian people 
with bullets. But the overwhelming circumstances to which I 
referred at the beginning of the interview have forced the PLA 
to become a police force that carries out joint patrols with the 
Jews, and whose members eat with the Jews and live with them and 
normalize their relations with them. We are fully convinced that 
the members of this police force will not open fire on the 
children of the stones or the strugglers whose role has been 
instrumental in achieving the partial withdrawal from the Gaza 
Strip, and whose role will also be instrumental in achieving any 
future withdrawal from the West Bank. This has taken place 
thanks to the blood they had shed and their sacrifices and not 
as a result of the intelligence and ability of the negotiators. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Major General Nasr Yusuf has made a 
statement on the issue of arms collection. As for yourself, you 
have said that this issue is taboo and a red line. Do you 
believe that Maj. Gen. Yusuf's statement was meant to be 
implemented? Or do you think it was made merely for media 
purposes? 
  Ghawshah: [passage omitted on Yusuf's background] 
The arms issue is indeed sensitive and important. It 
constitutes a red line. There are various weapons at stake. 
The most important of these are the weapons used by the 
mujahidin affiliated with the al-Qassam Battalions and other 
Palestinian forces. These weapons were only used in resistance 
to occupation troops and settlers. Everybody is well aware that 
weapons are dear to the mujahidin. The mujahidin's weapons are 
sacred. They should remain in the hands of the mujahidin. The 
mujahidin's right to bear arms is enshrined in all temporal 
charters and heavenly faiths. Additionally, the collection of 
arms from the Palestinian people is unacceptable. [passage 
omitted] 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: What about the Hamas Movement's 
military activities since the start of efforts to implement the 
autonomy agreement? 
  Ghawshah: The Hamas Movement has explained that it 
will uphold its principled Islamic jihad stand. Our jihad will 
continue as long as the occupation of our territories is 
maintained. [passage omitted] The selection of Zionist targets 
for attacks is made at the operations room of the al-Qassam 
Battalions in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian 
territories occupied in 1948. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Has Hamas thought of launching an 
opposition political party? Has it considered the idea of 
cooperating with some forces and figures to launch such a party 
so that it may deal politically with the self-rule authority? 
  Ghawshah: [passage omitted] As regards the Hamas 
Movement, this issue is under consideration, particularly since 
it was dictated by the developments of the current phase. 
However, the launching of parties has its pros and cons; and 
the cons might outweigh the pros. The launching of parties that 
implicitly approve the Palestinian-Israeli agreement might be 
facilitated. [passage omitted on Palestinian politics] 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: It is now three years since the 
opposition was launched under the name of the 10 factions, and, 
more recently, the Alliance of Palestinian Factions [APF] was 
formed. Don't you think that this is as far as these factions 
will go -- a ceiling that is not measuring up to the challenges? 
  Ghawshah: You may recall that in late 1993, 
following the signing of the Oslo accord, Hamas pressed for a 
provisional Palestinian leadership to take over. Regrettably, 
however, a number of the Palestinian factions had their sights 
set too low. We were so anxious for the 10 factions' formula to 
get off the ground that we went along with a formula based on 
political tasks rather than a political agenda, governed by a 
majority consensus rather than unanimity. We knew that this was 
not exactly the right formula, and hoped that it will be 
developed. Hamas, however, found itself a loner in the field, 
particularly regarding the intifadah and militarily. When they 
demanded that a combined nationalist-Islamic command be 
instituted inside the homeland, we demanded confidence- building 
initiatives on their part. For example, having refused to 
consider an alliance with Islamic forces in the elections for 
the Dentists Association in Gaza so that we may beat the 
capitulationist candidates, the democratic forces should not go 
on to call for a unified command. How can can there be a 
unified command if these other factions are not active in terms 
of jihad and the intifadah. This and other obstacles have stood 
in the way of refining the APF's formula. [passage omitted] 
  The APF formula needs reformulation in light of new factors. 
It may be better to establish a wide opposition front during 
the next stage--a front which has a definite concept and in 
which every one in the occupied territories takes part with all 
his might--and to activate the Palestinian diaspora. The 
Palestinian people in the diaspora, however, are the big losers. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas' decision to continue the 
intifadah still valid or is it under study and reconsideration? 
  Ghawshah: There is no doubt that the new era, as 
well as epitomizing the self-rule on the ground, will affect the 
intifadah, which is aimed at ending the occupation. As a 
result, the intifadah activity will drop in areas from which the 
Zionist forces withdraw. However, the intifadah's activities are 
numerous. Some activities are expected to reduce in the 
self-rule area after the end of the occupation, and some other 
activities will lead to friction with the self-rule authority 
and its supporters. The Hamas Movement will study and assess 
these matters, as well as intifadah activities, to secure the 
desired results and eliminate negative factors. Hamas may call 
for the reduction of some intifadah activities that have no 
impact on the overall conflict with the Zionists, especially 
within the self-rule area. But jihad and resistance will 
continue against the occupation everywhere. 
  Al-Ma'ayitah: Is Hamas satisfied by the 
interaction of Islamic peoples and movements with the intifadah 
and Hamas' role? 
  Ghawshah: [passage omitted] The Islamic movements 
in the cordon states have a basic role to play in supporting 
jihad activity undertaken by Hamas inside Palestine. These 
movements's political, popular, and militant performance has not 
reached the level required in the Islamic and political arenas.

  [Text] Shots were fired last night on the Jewish 
settlement of Kfar Darom in the center of the Gaza Strip. The 
gunfire came from a group of cars with Palestinian license 
plates which were traveling on the main road toward Khan Yunus. 
Kfar Darom residents returned the fire. No one was hurt on 
either side. The joint Israeli-Palestinian patrol arrived on 
the scene to investigate the incident. 
  In the territories last night, a Molotov cocktail was thrown 
at an Israeli bus near the settlement of Shavey Shomron. The 
bomb exploded on the road, no one was hurt. 
  The Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist 
organization has announced it intends to form a political party 
in the territories, but at the same time the Hamas spokesman, 
speaking in Amman, denied that a representative of the 
organization, Sa'id Balal, has agreed to become a member of the 
Palestinian National Authority. If Balal has chosen to take 
part in the authority, said the spokesman, it was on his own 
initiative, not as a representative of Hamas. 
  The Palestinian police chief in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, has called 
on Hamas members to stop their killing attacks and hand over 
their weapons. In a leaflet distributed in Gaza, the police 
also asked Hamas to turn in the people responsible for killing 
two Palestinians suspected of cooperating with Israel. 
  In other developments, about half the Fatah Hawks police 
recruits have quit, claiming there were informers among the 
conscripts. And last night some 260 Palestinian policemen 
entered Gaza from Egypt.

  [Text] Gaza--Maj. Gen. Nasr Yusuf, commander of the 
Palestine National Security Forces in the Gaza Strip, has stated 
that the Palestinian National Authority will arrest any person 
who collaborated with Israel or who will do so in the future 
outside the framework of the authority, provided that there is 
sufficient evidence. 
  Asked about Israel's stance on the arrest of agents who 
collaborated with it, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said in an exclusive 
interview that "this is an internal Palestinian affair. No one 
can compel us to pardon or to arrest anyone." He added that 
what we are doing on this matter is similar to what any other 
national authority in the world would do. 
  On the stance of the National Security Forces in the event a 
joint patrol comes under fire by Palestinian opponents, he said 
his forces have security duties that they will implement 
regardless of the circumstances because our people support any 
measure that provides them with security and stability. 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf disclosed that the authority is holding 
constant contacts with the Hamas leadership, noting that there 
have been good results so far and that he is optimistic that an 
agreement will be reached. 
  He said that he does not oppose peaceful demonstrations but 
that in the next stage such things will require a permit. 
  On the other hand, Maj. Gen. Yusuf said the main problem 
facing his forces is the shortage of funds, which the donor 
nations have promised to give to the Palestinian National 
Authority to pay the salaries of the security forces. He said: 
"They have given nothing, other than the vehicles provided by 
the United States." 
  Maj. Gen. Yusuf said a 300-man police force is expected to 
arrive in the Gaza Strip today to join the current force 
estimated at 2,600 men. He added that 120 men from the Fatah 
Hawks have been merged with the national security forces in view 
of their security expertise and knowledge of the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>
  [Text] The prime minister's bureau yesterday denied that 
members of the Fatah Hawks had been recruited by the Palestinian 
police. The announcement came in reaction to a complaint 
submitted by the "View Toward Peace" [Mabat Leshalom] 
organization. 
  The bureau's announcement came in the wake of an 
investigation conducted by Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head 
of the Israeli team at the joint security committee. 
  The communique stated that the Palestinians had said that 
the 
candidacies of all applicants to join the Palestinian police 
were brought before the committee. 
  The Palestinians also asserted that the Fatah Hawks had not 
been recruited but had only been concentrated in one location 
pending a decision on their future. [see previous Terrorism

  [Text] Commenting on statements by Robert Pelletreau, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian 
affairs, on a rift within the Hamas Movement, Hamas official 
Muhammad Nazzal said: I defy Pelletreau to name one Hamas 
leader inside or outside the occupied territories who is working 
to divide the movement, or who has deviated from its consensus 
of rejecting participation in the Palestinian authority or in 
the self-rule farce. 
  Nazzal said that the U.S. official's statements are sheer 
fabrications and part of the false reports claiming that the 
'Arafat leadership has succeeded in gaining the support of 
several Hamas leaders in the occupied territories for the 
Palestinian authority, thus deviating from the movement's 
constants of rejecting the capitulatory march and abiding by 
armed struggle and protracted Jihad until all the Palestinian 
national soil is liberated. 
  Pelletreau has claimed that a rift recently developed within 
Hamas in the occupied territories over participation in the 
Palestinian National Authority.

<F P=106> [Article by Oded Granot: "Born This Week: A Palestinian </F>
Shin Bet"] 
  [Text] Last Monday [16 May], shortly before he took off to 
Cairo, en route to Gaza, many friends came to Muhammad Dahlan's 
home in Tunis to bid him farewell. They clapped him on the 
shoulder, kissed him on both cheeks, and congratulated him 
warmly as a worthy man who is about to be given an important job 
in the homeland. 
  Between hugs, Dahlan apologized to his guests saying he must 
make several urgent phone calls, and then rushed to meet 
"President 'Arafat" for final instructions before getting on his 
way. 
  Dahlan is 33; no longer a child. Before he was deported from 
Israel in 1986, he was the head of the al-Shabibah, the Fatah 
youth movement in Gaza and the scare of the Strip. Now, that he 
is returning there as the head of the local security apparatus, 
he is excited like a child, nearly bursting into tears, just as 
he was several months ago when he heard the bad news of the 
elimination of six of his comrades, the Fatah Hawks from 
Jabalyah. 
  "Tomorrow morning, Tuesday," he told me on the phone from 
Tunis, "you will find me at the Rafah border crossing. A new 
era begins." 
  On the same Monday, several streets away from Dahlan's home, 
Jibril al-Rujub packed his bags, preparing to fly to Jordan, on 
his way to Jericho. Jibril is a tough man who spent nearly 17 
years of his life in Israeli prisons before being deported in 
1988. 
  Since then, from Tunis, he has never stopped activating 
terror groups in the occupied territories where he was in charge 
of the western sector. He wears a mustache, is well built, and 
has a low voice that goes soft suddenly when he talks about his 
imminent encounter which his wife and children, and the field 
activists. This time, he is not going there as a terrorist, but 
as the man in charge over security in the West Bank. 
  "On Tuesday," al-Rujub promised over the phone, "I will be 
at 
the Allenby Bridge, kissing the soil of the homeland. My six 
years in exile were a thousand times more difficult than the 17 
I spent in the Israeli prisons. The goal for which I had fought 
is almost attained. This is the happiest moment of my life." 
  Last Tuesday, the two former deportees and senior Fatah 
members crossed through the Allenby Bridge and the Rafah 
crossing into the territories, and at once became the heads of 
the Palestinian Shin Bet in the territories. At once, they 
changed their status from one of men wanted by the Israeli 
security services to one of heads of "a friendly intelligence 
service." 
  The Israeli negotiators, headed by Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, were worried over security and ways to foil acts of 
terror against Israel from within the territories Israel will 
evacuate. The new reality dictated a need to immediately locate 
Palestinian power brokers who could assume overall 
responsibility for domestic security [in the territories], which 
the Shin Bet and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will be unable 
to do from now on. 
  In one of the early meetings, Palestinian delegate Hassan 
'Asfur marked Muhammad Dahlan as a strong man "with a great 
future." Dahlan "was around" the Palestinian delegation during 
the Taba talks but, due to Israel's objections, he was left out 
of the delegation, staying on as an adviser. Two months after 
the Washington signing, Amnon Shahaq was introduced to Jibril 
al-Rujub, 'Arafat's assistant on West Bank affairs. "We did not 
choose them," a Jerusalem source said, "'Arafat did and sent 
them to us. All we can do now is see whether we can work 
together." 
  In their external features, there is no semblance between 
Dahlan and al-Rujub. Dahlan is thin, muscular, and fidgety and 
his eyes do not stop moving. Al-Rujub is heavy set, mustached, 
and tall. There is almost 10 years difference between them and 
the Gazan considers the Hebronite his teacher. 
  But beyond the external differences, they have a lot in 
common: both are central Fatah activists and both are very close 
to 'Arafat. Both were deported from the territories and both 
have a history of terrorist attacks, which made them local 
heroes and gave them a stronghold on the ground. Both never 
desisted from using violence in order to achieve their aims, 
including removing of political rivals. 
  Dahlan was born and raised in the Khan Yunus refugee camp. 
Some of his brothers were killed during Israel's occupation of 
the Gaza Strip. He position in Gaza is based on the 
al-Shabibah, the Fatah youth movement he set up. He was 
expelled from the Gaza Strip at the start of the intifadah, but 
continued to build up power in Tunis as 'Arafat's personal aide. 
He issued the orders to the Fatah Hawks to act against the 
Israeli occupation and to get rid of his enemies. Several months 
ago, his name was linked to the killing of two of the leaders of 
the rival camp in the strip. He did not admit to it. 
  Whatever the case, he had a good teacher in terrorist 
methods. For two years in Tunis, he learned from Abu-Jihad 
[Khalil al- Wazir], the person who headed the attacks on the 
western sector, until he was killed. 
  Jibril al-Rujub is the more important of the two. He comes 
from the village of Dura, south of the Hebron hills. In 1970, 
he was detained for operational activity within the Fatah 
framework, which included at least 10 attacks, and was sentenced 
to life in prison. In jail he quickly became a leader of the 
prisoners and of the committees which implemented the death 
"sentences" of suspected collaborators with Israel. It was also 
there that he wrote his book "Cell 704 -- The Experience of 
Prisoners at Nafha." 
  He was freed in the Jibril deal of 1985, again detained, and 
in 1988 was deported to Lebanon, and from there made his way to 
Tunis. His wife, Hiba, and his two children, remained here. In 
Tunis, he became Fatah commander of the West Bank, and was 
provided with bodyguards. It was there that he conscripted in 
1991 Refa'el Avraham of Rishon Leziyyon to assassinate Shamir 
and Sharon. "I was a terrorist, I am not ashamed of it," he 
says. 
  Despite the initial hesitations, Israeli elements slowly 
became convinced that the two are capable of controlling the 
area, influencing events, and setting up an efficient security 
apparatus. "The psychological block with Dahlan was easier to 
overcome than with al-Rujub," a security source in Israel admits. 
  The meetings with al-Rujub and Dahlan became more frequent 
the closer the date for the Gaza-Jericho agreement became. Most 
of the meetings were held in Europe. Once in Rome and once in 
Geneva. Several meetings were held in Cairo and Tunis. They 
dealt with finding solutions for the problems cropping up in the 
negotiations, such as the release of security prisoners, the 
return of deportees, etc. 
  In most of the meetings, except for Tunis, Israel was 
represented by three people: Amnon Shahaq, the Shin Bet chief, 
and Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser. 
These meetings helped Israel to get to know the two and the 
relations became informal, almost friendly. Press reports said 
the Shin Bet head visited Cairo on the eve of the signing 
ceremony on the pullout in order to meet al-Rujub and Dahlan and 
was received by them with hugs and kisses. 
  Al-Rujub was often seen on the 10th floor of the 
Intercontinental Hotel where the Israel delegation stayed in 
Cairo. He often moved between that floor and the Palestinians' 
floor. On one of those strolls, he encountered Shahaq talking 
with one of the members of the Israeli delegation and was 
curious. "What are you discussing?" he asked. There was 
silence. "It is not nice to have secrets," he edged them on in 
fluent Hebrew and smiled. For those who heard him and nearly 
keeled over because of his Hebrew, he had a ready-made immediate 
response: "I studied at your academy, at an Israeli jail." 
  Within the coordination efforts prior to their entry into 
the 
field, al-Rujub and Dahlan made sure they worked out with the 
Israelis the admission of people close to them. Most are former 
deportees and people suspected of hostile activities, who now 
make up the infrastructure of the security system to be set up 
on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
  Whoever thinks the two will have an easy time does not know 
what he is talking about. Their most urgent mission is to make 
their clout felt and their decisions implemented inside Fatah 
circles in the territories not keen about the new appointments. 
In Gaza, the Fatah Hawks have been unruly for months, and now 
is the time to see how Dahlan will bring them back into the fold. 
  Jibril al-Rujub is facing Fatah opposition groups inside the 
territories and outside them. He will need a great deal of 
energy, and may be a lot of gunpowder, to make sure all know he 
is boss. Later, the division of power with the Palestinian 
police, and especially, the issue of who has the last word on 
the ground, will crop up. 
  The most important test for Israel is naturally how the 
Palestinian Shin Bet deals with Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] and the other organizations in the territories which 
oppose the agreement. To the outside, al-Rujub and Dahlan can 
claim that there is no problem and that Hamas will not try to 
enter into a conflict with the autonomy's new security 
apparatus, but they know full well that they will straight away 
have to look for terrorists trying to infiltrate into the queue 
of laborers leaving for work in Israel. 
  Israel has been given an ambiguous promise that the moment 
the Palestinian Shin Bet apparatus starts operating in the 
territories, all those who oppose the agreement will be 
disarmed. "We will wait and see," Israeli sources said. Proper 
handling of Hamas and the detention of people suspected of 
trying to act against Israel will force al-Rujub and Dahlan to 
face a double test: on the one hand, with the Israeli Shin Bet, 
and on the other, the local population. They will have to tread 
very gently between the land mines. 
  Israel knows where mutual interests will cease and the real 
rivalry will start: The Israeli Shin Bet will not give way on 
its right to independently gather preventive intelligence. 
Al-Rujub and Dahlan know that. "I have no doubt that they will 
try to uncover our agents and collaborators in order to prove 
that they are running the show," an Israeli source said. 
  We should not envy any agent who is caught. Al-Rujub and 
Dahlan declare that from now on they will act only under the 
law, but nobody knows how long it will take them to get rid of 
their old habits: boiling plastic poured into the ear and 
interrogation under torture, methods the Shin Bet has never 
practiced. Will Israel be able to intervene and will it want to 
do so? 
  Al-Rujub and Dahlan entered the territories on Tuesday and 
set up the Palestinian Shin Bet, Lots of bodyguards came with 
them. An hysterical reception was prepared for them in Gaza and 
Jericho. Some people fired in the air out of joy, some out of 
fear.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, May 29 (AFP) -- The Moslem 
fundamentalist group Hamas said Sunday it would temporarily stop 
killing people suspected of collaborating with Israel, but the 
Palestinian police said the pledge did not go far enough. 
  Hamas said it had decided "to halt, for the time being, the 
pursuit of agents and their execution, in order to allow the 
Palestinian police to carry out their duties in this area." 
  But it warned that "the role of agents is turning more and 
more dangerous for the mujahedeen (Islamic fighters), who 
consider themselves in a constant struggle against the (Israeli) 
occupation forces." 
  A Palestinian police official, declining to be named, told 
AFP that the pledge was not enough. 
  "They have not handed over the culprits of Friday's 
executions and we are going to launch a search for them . . . 
not because it is Hamas but because they have broken the law and 
killed people living under our authority," he said. 
  The police earlier ordered Hamas to hand over militants who 
killed two Palestinians found hanging from electric pylons, in 
the first such murders since self-rule was launched this month. 
  "We have officially asked Hamas leaders to hand them over so 
we can try them. It is as much in their interest as it is in 
ours that they do it," said police chief Nasir Yusuf. 
  He said it was unacceptable that Hamas act as "prosecutor, 
lawyer, judge and hangman." 
  Control for security on the autonomous Gaza Strip and the 
self-rule enclave of Jericho has passed to the Palestinian 
police under the terms of the Israel-PLO autonomy deal, an 
agreement which Hamas opposes.

  [Text] Damascus, May 30 (AFP) -- The Moslem fundamentalist 
group Hamas on Monday refused to hand over militants who killed 
two suspected collaborators in Gaza to the Palestinian police. 
  It charged that the two men had been "planning to 
assassinate 
Hamas and Fatah leaders to stir up trouble and provoke fighting" 
between the fundamentalists and the PLO's main group. 
  "We refuse to hand over our militants and hope that the 
Palestinian police can carry out its role of pursuing 
collaborators. If so, it will save Hamas having to do it," the 
group said in a statement released in Damascus. 
  It warned police chief Nasr Yusuf to handle "this delicate 
situation" with care "so as not to provoke reactions which would 
not be in the interests of our people and their unity." 
  On the autonomous Gaza Strip, Yusuf issued a stern warning 
to 
Islamic fundamentalists after Hamas executed the two suspects on 
Friday and demanded that the killers be handed over. 
  Hamas announced Sunday it would stop killing collaborators, 
but only temporarily to see if the police could do its job. 
  Almost 1,000 Palestinians have been murdered by fellow 
Palestinians since the intifadah erupted in December 1987, but 
Israel maintains that fewer than 40 percent were collaborators.

<F P=106> [Article signed MTH/YLS: "Security Stepped Up in Foreign </F>
Embassies in Algiers"] 
  [Excerpt] Algiers, 3 Jun (BELGA) -- In light of the 
increased frequency of attacks by armed Islamic fundamentalists, 
foreign diplomats based in Algiers have "barricaded" themselves 
in, fearing that they may be targets of hostile actions. 
  In this regard, the staff at the Belgian Embassy has been 
reduced to a minimum. Two gendarmes have acted as bodyguards 
for the ambassador and have protected the premises for six 
months now. An armored car is eagerly awaited and should arrive 
in the next few weeks. 
  To reduce the risk of shots from the outside, the embassy 
wall has been raised almost a meter and fenced off. All 
entrances are being closely guarded. 
  In the visa section, people are kept under strict 
surveillance by a guard until one of the two counters becomes 
free. For several months, no more than five people have been 
permitted in the room at any one time. The other applicants 
have to wait outside and come in one by one to submit their 
applications. 
  Suspicious movements have been observed in recent days 
around 
a number of embassies, and rumors are circulating that the 
terrorists intend to attack foreign representatives. [passage

  [Text] Asyut, Egypt, June 1 (AFP)--A suspected Muslim 
militant shot and seriously wounded a policeman in southern 
Egypt late Wednesday, a source close to the security services 
said. 
  Salim Muhammad, a railway policeman, was in charge of 
security on the Cairo to Aswan train when he was shot as it left 
the station in Abu Mawas, in the al-Minya Province in Upper 
Egypt, 270 kilometres (167 miles) south of Cairo. 
  Security services launched a manhunt, after his attacker 
fled 
the scene, the source added. 
  Asyut is a stronghold for militants who have waged a 
two-year 
campaign to topple the secular government of President Husni 
Mubarak, which has left more than 400 dead, including policemen. 
  But until recently al-Minya had not witnessed many clashes 
between security forces and militants.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA)--Interior Minister Hasan 
al-Alfi has emphasized that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith 
Madani was a link between terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, who was 
killed in a confrontation with the police last month, and the 
sources abroad who finance terrorism. He noted that 
investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was 
involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and 
distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi, 
who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several 
previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He 
noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and 
that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public 
Prosecution Office. 
  Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer 
Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used 
against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned 
to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health 
condition led to his death and thus we lost much information 
that we were supposed to obtain from him. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cairo, 28 May (MENA)--Citizen Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
Ahmad was killed and his father injured when a strange object 
exploded while they were buying scrap metal from Sabri Sayyid 
Abu-Zayd, a scrap metal dealer in the eastern part of al-Qanatir 
al-Khayriyah. 
  A responsible security source from the Interior Ministry 
stated that the incident took place in the town of Kafr 
al-Dawwar at 1430 when the two citizens were inspecting various 
pieces of metal. They found a strange metal object which looks 
like the armature of a car with a wire attached to it. Upon 
pulling the wire, the metal piece exploded. 
  The salesman gathered the three similar-looking pieces and 
threw them into the water canal. Security men retrieved and 
detonated them. 
  The security source said it is clear that these metal 
objects 
are explosives marked with "45 military offensive." The metal 
pieces have been seized. 
  A report has been prepared on the incident and the northern 
military region of Alexandria has been notified so an explosives 
expert can come down to take the necessary measures regarding 
the seized bombs.

  [Text] The JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front] 
president, Mr. Yasin Malik, had a narrow escape in a murderous 
attack on his life by the militants of rival group Hizbul 
Mojahedin in Srinagar today. Mr. Malik told a press conference 
that the militants of Hizbul Mojahedin tried to kidnap him from 
SMHS Hospital in Srinagar, but his supporters foiled the 
attempt. The Hizbul Mojahedin then fired several rounds toward 
Malik, but he escaped unhurt as the people surrounded him. 
  The attack on Mr. Malik comes in the wake of the killing of 
three top functionaries of JKLF by Hizbul Mojahedin since last 
night. Mr. Malik held a demonstration against these killings 
and over 10,000 people participated in the procession, which 
raised slogans against Pakistan and Hizbul Mojahedin militants.

  [Text] Jammu, April 25--Pakistan's inter-services 
intelligence (ISI) has launched a fresh operation to step up 
militant violence in Kashmir and to scuttle any move of the 
Centre to restore the democratic process in Jammu and Kashmir, 
official sources here said, reports PTI. 
  Under the operation "expense support," the ISI has begun 
pumping into Jammu and Kashmir huge amounts of money, including 
foreign currency to sustain militancy, besides motivating people 
to re-activate propaganda on alleged atrocities by security 
forces. 
  This money would als be used for "damage control" efforts in 
the areas, where militant support has been waning in Kashmir due 
to pressure of the security forces and wrong actions of 
militants. 
  The sources said more than Rs 80 crores had reached pro-Pak 
militant outfits in Kashmir between December last year and end 
of January this year in the aftermath of Hazratbal crisis. 
  However, the security forces had seized some consignments of 
cash and gold from the Jammu borders during past few months, the 
sources said, adding the seizure including foreign currency was 
approximately estimated to be around Rs 4 crores. 
  Most of these consignments have reached the state through 
"couriers." In some cases money was sent in the name of relief 
through some trusts like America-based "Kashmir-American 
council" and the Gulf-based "Jamat-i-Sihadis." Funds were sent 
through banks to frontline pro-Pak Hizbul Mujahideen which 
stands for merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan, the 
sources said. 
  The pro-independent outfit, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation 
Front (JKLF), which started militant movement in Kashmir early, 
was being deprived this financial support as Pakistan was 
opposed to its moves for "independence of Kashmir." 
  The sources said one of the arrested Hizbul Mujahideen 
militants, Ashfaq Ahmed Lone, had told his interrogators that he 
had got Rs 16 lakhs from the ISI for his outfit early this year. 
  Another captured militant, Shahab-Uddin of the Hizbul 
Mujahideen, had admitted that he had brought $10,000 for Master 
Ahsan Dar, a former commander-in-chief of the Hizbul Mujahideen. 
  The money for Master Ahsan Dar was sent by Mohammad Yusuf, a 
patron of Hizbul Mujahideen in Rawalpindi, the sources said. 
  The consignments under this operation also included 
anti-India propaganda material for distribution among the local 
population in Kashmir and other areas of Jammu region. 
  The ISI, the sources said, was forced to launch this 
operation in the wake of increasing alienation of the people 
from Pak-sponsored militants, who were indulging now in criminal 
acts. 
  Pakistan has also been making efforts to scare away the 
political leaders from initiating political process in Jammu and 
Kashmir, the sources added. 
  The ISI has formed a "Jehad council," a strategic 
cartel of all the pro-Pakistan militant groups, adds UNI. 
  Talking to a group of visiting newsmen, Brig Gen Staff 
(operations) Arjun Ray said that headquarters of the council was 
located in Muzafarrabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). It 
was acting as the spokesman of all the militant groups in the 
valley to the Pakistan government. 
  Brig Ray said the council had been designated to look after 
the raising and distribution of funds to the various militant 
outfits on behalf of the ISI and would also project the militant 
outfits' requirements of arms and ammunition.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Dear listeners: One of the duties of the peshmerga 
force is to punish traitors and criminals. Throughout its 
period of activity, the peshmerga force has carried out many 
such operations, and especially recently we have heard many 
reports on the punishment and the revolutionary execution of 
traitors broadcast on the Voice of Iranian Kordestan [VOIK]. 
  Naturally the punishment of the traitors and of those who 
serve the regime and commit crimes against the people and the 
peshmerga force is an aspect of armed struggle. Of course the 
peshmerga force both kills and is killed through its armed 
struggle against a powerful and armed enemy because armed 
struggle is a matter of life or death and anyone who is armed 
will be killed if he does not kill the enemy himself. 
  Moreover as in most countries of the world, punishment for 
traitors and for those who harm the interests of their nation 
and of their homeland, and who work against the interests of 
their people and their land is execution, unless we are talking 
about countries where capital punishment has been banned and 
replaced by life imprisonment. Of course this is meaningless 
under the current conditions in Kordestan during a violent and 
bloody armed struggle. 
  Thus, there is no doubt that traitors and criminals should 
be 
punished as persistently and as harshly as possible. As stated 
above this is basically one of the duties of the peshmerga force 
in its struggle. However there are some important points which 
should be considered when carrying out this duty; and although 
we are sure that the party committees and the party's 
revolutionary peshmerga force always has these points and many 
others in mind, we deem it necessary to re-emphasize them. 
  The most important point to underline is that when punishing 
people, the objective is not revenge. Killing and executing 
constitute only one method of punishment and should be used as a 
last resort. This means that when punishing culprits, execution 
should only be carried out if all other methods have proven to 
be ineffective or when the treachery is so great that the only 
punishment is execution. 
  We have repeatedly said that during an armed struggle, 
resorting to execution may be the simplest thing to do. 
However, the simplest thing is not always the best thing. If 
we want to comment more precisely on the way that traitors 
should be executed, we believe that we should start from the 
beginning to reach the last phase which is execution. 
  First and foremost, when speaking about the punishment of a 
traitor it should first be proven that person has actually 
committed treason. Treason is a serious accusation, and as 
previously pointed out, even warrants punishment by execution. 
Therefore, such an accusation should not be made lightly 
against someone, and someone should not be branded a traitor 
merely on the basis of allegations by a couple of people or on 
the basis of reports by some. In order to determine the extent 
of the crime committed by someone, precise and detailed 
investigations should be carried out and incontestable documents 
should exist. During the investigations, the (?type) of treason 
should be clarified since treason has varying degrees. This 
means that each type of treason does not warrant punishment by 
execution and that in many cases the type or degree of treason 
may call for less severe punishment. 
  Treason committed by someone who reports on the location of 
the peshmerga force but whose act does not harm the peshmerga in 
any way is different from treason that is committed by someone 
who leads one or several peshmerga to martyrdom, or from treason 
committed by someone who has participated in the war against the 
peshmerga and whose hands are stained with the blood of the 
peshmerga. Such degrees of treason should be punished 
accordingly. 
  Another point is, as stated above, that execution is the 
last 
resort. This is why death sentences should be issued only when 
all other ways to punish, or ways to make a misled person repent 
have been exhausted. For example, informing and showing the 
right way to someone who has been caught in the web of treason 
is undoubtedly the first, and most necessary, step to be taken. 
A misled person can be shown the right path through the party 
mechanisms and by the peshmerga force directly or indirectly 
through encouragement of friends, relatives, acquaintances, and 
neighbors. When all these methods prove ineffective, he should 
then be warned and threatened. 
  In addition to all this, the decision on executing a traitor 
is a collective decision which should be adopted through 
consultations and not individually. In other words, when all 
said points are observed, when all the phases referred to above 
have been completed, and when things reach a point where someone 
has to be executed, a decision on this should be discussed at 
the party committee and all its aspects be analyzed and 
examined. It is only then that orders to carry out the 
execution should be given to the peshmerga force. 
  It should be said that the party committees in the various 
parts of Kordestan have the authority and competence to execute 
traitors and criminals. However, it should be noted that only 
the committee or, at least, three high-ranking officials of the 
party have this authority and competence and none of the party 
members have this authority and competence on their own. In 
addition, in cases when a decision on such an important issue 
should be made, it is better to ask for the opinion of many 
others too. And, if possible, the views of a number of the 
villagers and especially of some members of the rural council of 
the area where the traitor lives should be sought because, as 
the adage goes, it is better to be safe than sorry. It is only 
in this way that those who issue death sentences can have a 
clear conscience. 
  When the death sentence for a traitor is issued its 
execution 
is assigned to the peshmerga force. If the traitor is not being 
held by the peshmerga and the sentence has been issued in 
absentia, the peshmerga force should attempt to arrest him. 
However, the peshmerga should try, as best as possible, to hand 
over the traitor to the party committee so that he will have the 
right to defend himself or have another hearing. Of course this 
is not a simple task and involves many problems because the 
culprit is in the area which is under the enemy's control and he 
may exploit this situation and refuse to surrender to the 
peshmerga force and to attempt his self-defense or to cry out to 
the enemy for help. In all these cases, there is the 
possibility that the lives of the peshmerga are threatened. 
This is why we do not consider this duty compulsory, hence our 
noting that this is something which the peshmerga should try to 
do as best as possible. 
  The last point which should be noted as far as the execution 
of a traitor is concerned is that after the punishment of the 
traitor, the people should be clearly informed on the reasons 
for this execution and the record of the traitor. As far as the 
punishments that have been carried out by the party committees, 
we see that this point has been very well observed since reports 
on these executions have been sent to the VOIK. This is a 
source of happiness. 
  All the efforts and struggles by any individual or 
revolutionary organization are for the people. This is why the 
reasons for the behavior of these individuals and organizations 
and their political and social stances should be clear for the 
people during the struggle so that the people will be able to 
understand them and to voluntarily support them. Moreover, the 
major objective behind punishments is to teach a lesson to 
others; and the execution of a traitor can be a lesson only when 
those who are doing more or less what the traitor did can see 
what acts the party considers to be treason and punishable by 
execution and, in a nutshell, see and understand the 
consequences of their acts. 
  As stated at the beginning of this talk, we believe that the 
responsible political people inside the party and among the 
ranks of the revolutionary peshmerga will observe these and many 
other important points. Reports on some revolutionary 
executions that have been received by the VOIK until now prove 
this point; and this is a source of pride for us. Thus, we hope 
that our few words will make our combatant brothers more alert 
and more persistent in carrying out their duties. Do not forget 
that the peshmerga force is fighting for human rights and the 
members are sacrificing their lives in the process. Thus, they 
should not unwillingly commit acts that will trample on the 
human rights of an individual or of a group of people.

  [Text] Two Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] fugitives 
were killed this afternoon in the village of al-Ram, north of 
Jerusalem, during an operation by the Shin Bet and the Israel 
Police special antiterror unit. 
  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that one of the two men 
killed was Yusuf Naji, the murderer of the late Shin Bet agent 
No'am Kohen. As may be recalled, Naji was a former collaborator 
with the authorities and Kohen was his handler. 
  In the course of a meeting, Naji and his accomplices shot 
No'am Kohen and his two bodyguards. No'am Kohen died as a 
result of the shooting and the Shin Bet has been conducting a 
manhunt after Naji ever since.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 3 (AFP) -- A Hizballah 
guerrilla was killed and a Fijian peacekeeper wounded in a 
pre-dawn clash Friday in south Lebanon, the spokesman of the UN 
Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] said. 
  The fighting broke out when Hizballah guerrillas refused to 
have their vehicles searched for weapons at a Fijian checkpoint 
in the Tyre region near Israel's self-declared "security zone" 
in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel told reporters. 
  Shooting broke out during which a Hizballah guerrilla was 
killed and a Fijian soldier wounded, he added. 
  Sporadic gunfire also targeted three other Fijian positions 
in the Tyre region but there were no casualties, the spokesman 
said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] A Hizballah information source has said that the 
incident that occurred with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon 
[UNIFIL] Fijian contingent in the al-Qulaylah area this morning 
came about because that contingent fired at a resistance group 
without warning. The incident left two resistance men injured, 
one of them seriously, and he died soon afterwards. 
  The source said that it was surprising that the UNIFIL force 
in the area was placed on alert afterwards and set up 
checkpoints and ambushes in a provocative way. They also fired 
at a Hizballah envoy who was going to the UNIFIL checkpoint in 
al-Tayyibah to discuss outstanding incidents. He was hit in the 
foot and received shrapnel wounds in his face. 
  Active contacts are under way to address the incident and 
its 
repercussions.

  [Excerpt] As far as Israel and Washington are concerned, 
the importance of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, who was kidnapped 
by Israel from his home in Qasr Naba, is that he was the 
official in charge of Central Security in the Amal Movement 
before he left it in 1988 and joined the "Faithful Resistance" 
[al-muqawamah al-mu'minah]. 
  More specifically, he is important because the elements 
under 
his command were the ones who arrested Israeli pilot Ron Arad in 
1986 after his military aircraft was shot down during an air 
raid near Sidon. The pilot remained in al-Dirani's custody for 
a period of time. 
  According to informed sources, Washington had prior 
knowledge 
of the kidnapping operation and encouraged it, provided that it 
was a "clean operation." Washington is interested in al-Hajj 
al-Dirani for one reason: he is accused while he was an Amal 
official of smuggling in his own car U.S. intelligence officer 
William Higgins after he was kidnapped on 17 February 1988 and 
handing him over to the party that announced his execution in 
1989 a few days after Israel carried out a commando operation in 
Jibshit in which it kidnapped Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd. (At 
that time AL-SHIRA' published information indicating that 
Higgins was dead before Hizballah announced that it had executed 
him.) [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has stated 
that at this stage we must not preoccupy ourselves with talking 
about the state's responsibility regarding the Israeli Army's 
kidnapping of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, but we must think 
quietly about how to respond. 
  In his Friday sermon, which he delivered at Imam al-Rida 
Mosque in B'ir al-'Abd [southern suburb of Beirut], Fadlallah 
said: Our brother al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani was kidnapped on 
the night of 'Id al-Adha. When we study this issue, we find it 
is a victory for Israel over all the various forces on the 
ground. There were political, security, and military gaps. We 
have discovered something about this country as far as the 
mentality of the government. This government does not respect 
its people. This government is not prepared to forgo its 
comfort and look after the citizen's interests. [passage omitted] 
  We must think quietly how to respond. You know that the 
resistance's arm is long. The enemy foreign minister said that 
Israel's arm is long. When Israel assassinated Sayyid 'Abbas 
al- Musawi, the strugglers taught him that their arm reached 
Israel in Argentina. The battle is as big as the world and as 
long as the length of time. We will work with all 
responsibility as Muslim strugglers all over the world. 
  Fadlallah said that Israel did not only kidnap al-Dirani, it 
also kidnapped every Lebanese citizen. It kidnapped the state, 
the government, and the people.

  [Text] Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli, former secretary general of 
the Hizballah terrorist organization, has again claimed that 
Israeli pilot Ron Arad was killed by his captors or died in 
captivity. In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR 
today, al-Tufayli said he does not believe that anyone stands to 
gain anything by detaining Arad. He added that the Syrians have 
denied that they are holding Arad; in fact, they are searching 
for him.

<F P=106> [Part one of an "exclusive" two-part interview with Shaykh </F>
Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, Chairman of the Higher Islamic 
Shiite Council, in Lebanon by unidentified ETTELA'AT 
correspondent; place, date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [ETTELA'AT] Can you clarify 
the effects of the imposed peace in the Middle East and the 
negligent attitude of some governments toward confronting the 
effects of this imposed war in the Middle East? 
  [Shams al-Din] [passage omitted] In view of the fact that 
the 
designs of the Zionist movement have been implemented in 
Palestine, we can say that from this angle we have sustained 
defeat. [passage omitted] However, defeat does not mean that we 
have lost all our means of defense. I stress that the ummah has 
not used all its offensive resources but has merely suspended 
the use of its means for defense. [passage omitted] 
  Our condition at present is such that the Arab plan has 
failed and the Islamic plan has failed. The only place where 
the Islamic program continues is the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
which is also under an embargo that is being tightened in the 
political, economic, and security fields. I fear that the 
Zionists will drive a wedge thus paving the way for the 
infiltration of the enemy's designs of our ranks. [passage 
omitted] 
  Western politicians say that this situation is a reality and 
has evolved this way. We tell them that evil is also a reality 
in this world, but should we bow down to it? We should resist 
it instead. [passage omitted on World War I] 
  The fact is that the ummah's struggle against Zionism is not 
a struggle of one generation at one particular time. The 
Zionist plot belongs to a nation which has placed itself in the 
thick of international interests; right from the outset, the 
ummah should fight against it, and it should be considered a 
struggle spanning many generations. 
  A long-term strategy should be formulated; part of this 
strategy is to ignore governments, because this struggle does 
not end with the death of a king or a president. It the battle 
of all the ummah, whether it spans one generation or three 
generations. We should also accept the fact that we will have 
many losses on this path. This is because the plot that we have 
to fight against is not confined to Palestine, but is a 
worldwide plot. 
  This is one of the strategic errors--that is, the Arabs 
thought they could combat Zionist plots in the short term. It 
is for this reason that we state that the ummah should reassert 
itself to combat the Zionist plot, as the ummah is not limited 
to a single generation.

<F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn from Beirut] </F>
  [Text] A few months before the convening of the 
organizational conference to elect the secretary general, the 
Shura Council, and the Political Bureau, Hizballah began to 
witness a violent struggle over its leadership and future. 
While Hasan Nasrallah is preparing lists of names of new 
officials to lead a corrective movement under his command, and 
also preparing to send the names to Tehran to get its blessings, 
Subhi al-Tufayli, backed by the radical Iranian wing, is 
exerting efforts to carry out a coup. What is Nasrallah's plan 
for the "new Hizballah" and how is al-Tufayli working to prevent 
the current secretary general from renewing his term and from 
joining the peace process at the expense of the resistance? 
  "The battle will be crucial and decisive. We should begin to 
prepare for it from now." With this, a senior Hizballah 
official commented on the questions posed by some Hizballah 
leaders on the reasons of opening the file of the 
"organizational conference" more than seven months before the 
date of convening the conference, something which prtends the 
dangers of a real "bone-breaking" battle from which the party 
itself, in its current shape, might not emerge safe. 
  Observers believe that a crucial battle has begun to rage 
behind the scenes in Hizballah, heralding a true war, that will 
be witnessed by the organizational conference scheduled to be 
held early next year, on the identity and personality of the new 
secretary general and the members of the Shura Council and the 
Political Bureau. 
  The current secretary general, Mr. Hasan Nasrallah, has 
already begun his battle and is preparing to wage it with all 
his strength. However, signs indicate that Nasrallah's future 
battle will not be easy and will witness a very fierce conflict 
that has been surfacing for sometime, namely, an inter-Lebanese 
conflict and another inter-Iranian conflict that plays a 
decisive role in determining the future of Hizballah. 
  Several months before the date of convening that "historic 
conference," the Lebanese part of Hizballah seems to be captive 
to three leaderships: 
  A current led by Hasan Nasrallah; 
  A current led by former Secretary General Shaykh Subhi al- 
Tufayli, who counts on the support of Political Bureau member 
Shaykh Khadr Tulays; 
  A current led by Deputy Shaykh Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid. 
  So far, Nasrallah's current seems to be the strongest. It is 
enjoying the Iranian regime's support, particularly the 
"pigeons" current in Tehran, led by President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani. He is also the brother of Hajj Mahmud and 
the Shura Council speaker. In return, al-Tufayli enjoys the 
support of the radical current in Iran, which is led by former 
Interior Minister Ayatollah Mohtashemi who also counts on the 
support of Mehdi Karrubi and Ahmed Khomeyni. The final decision 
will be made by leader 'Ali Khamene'i if he decides to settle 
the situation in favor of the extremists. 
  Shaykh Ibrahim al-Sayyid, who is leading a "liberal" 
current, 
seems to be the weakest, especially since this is a strange 
approach to Hizballah. Despite this, Mr. Nasrallah was shocked 
and surprised when someone told him that Deputy Ibrahim Amin 
al-Sayyid wants to nominate himself for the secretary general 
post, especially since the star of al-Sayyid began to overshadow 
that of Nasrallah. This is why Nasrallah's reaction was very 
swift. He began to launch a campaign against al-Sayyid and to 
accuse him of opening channels with the Lebanese Government and 
of cooperating with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, and later, 
al-Sayyid pretended to be attacking and criticizing al-Hariri's 
government, according to Nasrallah's accusations. 
  Information emphasizes that Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli began 
his 
preparations early for this confrontation. For several months, 
al-Tufayli has been holding meetings with the Hizballah members 
and officials in charge of areas who have the right to vote at 
the conference, and, thus, the right to elect a secretary 
general. These meetings were meant to draw support and "expose 
the schemes" Hasan Nasrallah is trying to peddle in Hizballah's 
cellars. 
  In his private meetings, al-Tufayli asserted to those close 
to him that Nasrallah has returned to the game of trickery and 
promises in an attempt to deflate the party's internal 
opposition. In this regard, it was noted that he once again 
tried to appease deputy al- Hajj Muhammad Yaghi and Shaykh 
Muhammad Yazbik, members of the party's Shura Council, and other 
Political Bureau members. 
  Shaykh al-Tufayli recently began to set up special 
institutions such as media and security offices, and appointed 
advisers and assistants. He also held meetings with Arab 
fundamentalist personalities, including groups belonging to the 
"Egyptian Jihad" organization in the Harat Hurayk neighborhood 
of Beirut with the aim of expanding his alliances by appeasing 
the Arab fundamentalist groups in Lebanon, particularly in the 
al-Biqa' area. 
  However, those close to the current secretary general assert 
that he will remain in his post and will run for a new term in 
the coming conference. These people indicate that Nasrallah is 
now focusing his efforts on consolidating his position, working 
out basic points, and preparing the next program in order to 
successfully join the conference, particularly on the level of 
the party's new political rhetoric and defining its positions on 
urgent regional and international issues such as the 
"Gaza-Jericho" agreement and what is taking place in Yemen. 
  In the prior preparations for his new, yet old, position, 
Nasrallah even formed both a new party Shura commission and a 
Political Bureau body. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the 
first draft of Hizballah's next Shura Council contains known 
names, including deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Hunaysh, deputy al-Hajj 
Muhammad Yaghi, al-Hajj Khalil Harb, Fu'ad Shakar, Shaykh 
Muhammad Yazbik, Shaykh Nabil Qaduq, and Hashim Safiyy-al-Din in 
addition to a group of Hizballah officials. 
  The draft of the Political Bureau's body was prepared to be 
a 
qualitative stride which Nasrallah would make. It has been 
learned that he would try to appoint al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Halim 'Atwi 
as official in charge of the Political Bureau, while keeping 
'Ammar al-Musawi as deputy head, with Abu-Sa'id al-Khansa', 
Nawwaf al-Musawi, Shaykh Tawfiq al-Miqdad, Shaykh Zuhayr Kinj, 
deputy Khadr Tulays (if he agrees), al-Hajj Mustafa Qamar, 
Shaykh Husayn Kurani, Shaykh Hatim Abu-Diyah, and others, as 
members. 
  Nasrallah began to put the final touches on the two drafts 
before sending two copies of them to the Iranian leadership for 
the final opinion, remarks, and blessing. Nasrallah believes 
that, in the next phase, priority should be given to 
consolidating the party's status and internal structure, 
especially in view of the current regional and international 
arrangements, so that the party will be able to confront these 
conditions--particularly the disarming of the resistance--that 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has set in his 
shuttle tours. 
  In fact, Hizballah is now gravely concerned on various 
levels 
over passing safely through the phase of [Middle East] peace. 
There is a consensus that the party would pay a price for any 
breakthrough in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, and that the 
party is convinced that destroying its military machine, as a 
minimum, is the most prominent U.S.-Israeli condition. 
Nasrallah is also well aware that there will be no role for 
resistance, and, thus, his military role after the achievement 
of peace. This will definitely weaken the party, diminish its 
luster, and perhaps terminate it if it does not begin to 
reconsider its calculations and adapt to the developments. 
  In this regard, knowledgeable sources say that Nasrallah has 
for a while been assessing the situation, and that he is 
currently focusing his effort on moving the party into a new 
phase which would enable it to remain on political map in 
Lebanon within a democratic framework. Nasrallah is planning to 
take advantage of the expected developments to enable Hizballah 
to remain strong in the Lebanese political arena, being in 
possession of huge financial resources supplied by its 
investments and the institutions and companies that it has 
established. 
  Evidently, the power struggle within Hizballah today 
revolves 
around these expected developments and ways of dealing with the 
next phase. In this regard, it has been noted that Nasrallah's 
opponents are taking advantage of Nasrallah's move toward a 
"corrective movement" to launch a fierce campaign against him. 
Thus, they take every chance to charge the present secretary 
general of leading the party to the peace settlement, and that 
all his efforts and moves are part of an attempt to enter the 
"stage of Israeli peace even at the expense of the resistance." 
They indicate that Nasrallah's course is in agreement with the 
line of Iranian President Rafsajani, who has been attempting to 
establish--and may have already established--secret relations 
and contacts with the Americans and their allies in the region. 
Those opponents go so far as to accuse the secretary general of 
working to change the party's bylaws and amend certain posts to 
modify the Hizballah bylaws following the fashion of leftist 
Western parties. 
  Nasrallah's opponents say that his cards and intentions were 
exposed during the previous organizational congress through the 
game of deception he played against a number of the Shura 
Council following his false promises. 
  The question is: Will Hizballah escape the dangers of an 
internal split, or will it become like the other parties divided 
into several wings? Those who have access to what is taking 
place inside the party have noticed that Shaykh Subhi 
al-Tufayli's moves and trends are supported on the regional 
level and that he has become strong in this phase. He has money 
and men and he was able to exploit the resentment created 
against the Lebanese regime during the airport bridge incident. 
He also exploited the issue of Hizballah's handing over of a 
number of those wanted by the Lebanese state for carrying arms 
during the al-Quds Day demonstration on the last Friday of 
Ramadan. 
  Hasan Nasrallah or Subhi al-Tufayli? 
  The battle has not been decided yet because the future of 
Hizballah will be decided in Tehran, the source of financial 
support and the higher political tutelage. And whether the 
decision will be in favor of Nasrallah's corrective movement or 
al-Tufayli's coup is linked with deciding the matter between the 
moderate current and the radical extremist current in Iran, with 
deciding the new Iranian policy on the Middle East, and with the 
final stand vis-a-vis the peace process. New surprises will 
appear before next year. Until then, the battle will continue 
within the Lebanese Hizballah Party. It seems so through the 
meetings and preparations carried out by every party. It also 
appears that the situation will escalate in the coming months.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi and al-Amin </F>
Fuhaymah, by AL-BALAGH Editor; place and date not given; 
translated and summarized by Mufti Muhammad Hasam-Allah Sharifi; 
] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] These two persons 
['Abd-al-Basit al-Miqrahi and al-Amin Fuhaymah] are under heavy 
security now, and people are not allowed to see them. If someone 
wants to meet them, he is investigated at several levels. 
  Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of the Libyan newspaper 
AL-BALAGH, 
is the first person who had a lengthy talk with them and got 
information from them about the crash so that a way could be 
found to relieve Libya of the problems it is facing because of 
these two persons. The goal was to satisfy the United States so 
it would lift the restrictions it has imposed on Libya. However, 
these two persons did not cooperate with him during this 
interview and kept talking to him about other things. Later, 
al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit sent a message to Mr. Ibrahim, the 
editor, unexpectedly and told him that they were both very 
perturbed and wanted to meet with him immediately. They said 
that they wanted to meet with him to resolve this issue with his 
help. The editor told him to wait for a few days as there might 
be a better solution. Mr. al-Amin's mother died during those 
days and she could not bear to be separated from her son. 
Finally, Mr. Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl, editor of AL-BALAGH, went to 
meet 'Abd-al-Basit in his home in Tripoli. He was waiting for 
him at the door of his house and smiled when he saw him. He told 
the editor that he was used to sufferings, but he did not know 
why he was accused of this crime. He said that he had faith in 
God and that He will protect him and watch over him. The whole 
story is clear to God like a bright day. 
  'Abd-al-Basit is about 41 years old and al-Amin is the same 
age. 'Abd-al-Basit said that God had arranged for people to be 
kind to each other in this world. Some people spend their lives 
in happiness and in the end they leave all their desires and 
plans and enter the valley of death. Some leave this world early 
and some spend a lot of time here; however, all their wishes are 
not fulfilled. One's life is never long enough for one's desires 
and plans to be fulfilled. Ibrahim taped the whole interview. 
  During tea, 'Abd-al-Basit's younger son 'Abd-al-[name 
incomplete as published] came into the room and said that his 
daddy and uncle al-Amin were falsely accused of these crimes. 
They have forced these two to spend their lives like nomads. 
They cannot live peacefully and quietly. Both of them suggested 
during this interview that they would present their case in the 
Libyan Supreme Court so that "we can explain our side to the 
world and the people can decide what is wrong and what is right. 
Who is following the right path and who is wrong?" 
  Whenever these two talk, the first thing they say is that 
the 
real criminal is being ignored and they are being made 
scapegoats. They are very depressed and look very sad. 
  Their wives say that Tripoli with its breadth and length has 
become very cramped for them. "Ever since our husbands were 
accused of this crime, we have been carrying this heavy burden 
in our minds. We are in a strange situation. We can be 
considered neither dead nor alive. We feel great vexation. 
Whenever we meet each other, we ask why we are living? In which 
world are we living? What is the use of leading a life full of 
fear? At times, there are articles about us in newspapers, 
magazines, and journals. Some encourage us and some deflate our 
fortitude." 
  'Abd-al-Basit has been a student of science in prestigious 
American universities and also has higher education in 
geography. When he returned home after finishing his education, 
he was appointed chief administrator of the education 
department. Mr. al-Amin worked for Libyan Airlines. He receives 
a stipend from Libyan Airlines now. 
  They were asked in this detailed interview why did they 
refuse to go to the United States or Great Britain if they claim 
to be innocent and consider themselves wrongly accused? They 
answered that truth has its place. "We are being accused 
falsely; there is not truth in it. We are innocent. However, how 
can we trust them to be our well-wishers and make a just 
decision and not spite us. The United States and Britain have 
already declared that they do not need any court to make a 
decision about us. All they want is al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit. 
They will not be satisfied with anything less. They do not want 
to get advice from lawyers and follow up on the facts as these 
surface. They have already given their verdict on their 
televisions. How can we expect justice from them?" 
  At the end of this interview, Ibrahim al-Ghuwayl emphasized 
to them that the accusation being levied against them about 
destroying the Pan Am airplane by the United States and Britain 
appears to be true, because these two countries do not trust 
their own legal systems and do not want another impartial nation 
to investigate this case and give a decision. Meanwhile these 
two declare themselves to be innocent and refuse to accept any 
blame. In such a situation no one can be a criminal just because 
someone calls them so. 
  Some people say that these two are living like kings and 
enjoying themselves. I have visited them and observed them 
closely. In my opinion, no other person is so sacred and in 
danger in Tripoli as are these two. Al-Amin's home is on one 
corner of Tripoli where he lives like a bird in a cage. He 
cannot go anywhere openly and spends his time within a limited 
sphere. The situation of 'Abd-al-Basit is not any different. 
  They both said that this accusation has influenced their 
family lives greatly. "We are totally cut off from society, and 
our wives and children are also suffering because of this crime. 
We are suffering mentally because of it. Perhaps this will not 
end even after we are dead. We are suffering from the crime of 
innocence. We pray to God all the time to bring the real 
criminal in front of the world so that the facts--the identities 
of those people who have accused them and the facts about those 
who have been accused--are revealed." 
  Both of them emphasized that they will not bow down to the 
unfair demands of the United States and continue to call the 
U.S. accusation wrong. "How the United States always has double 
standards about everything is clear from this example. It 
attacked an Iranian airplane and downed it. It admitted to this 
action; however, no punishment was given to it, and it is not 
even willing to be punished for being involved in this crime. A 
similar situation has occurred in many countries, but no action 
was taken against other countries. What reason can there be for 
this attitude, other than that the people who live in Libya are 
Muslims and the Unites States is a strong enemy of Muslims and 
Islam." 
  Al-Amin Fuhaymah described a personal sorrow and said, "What 
has bothered me the most all this time is that my beloved mother 
died during this period. Her eyes were open even at the time of 
her death waiting for me. Alas, I could not see my mother 
because of the barriers created by the U.S. efforts. I am 
spending my life like a nomad. I am here today and will be 
hiding in another place tomorrow. Some time here and some time 
there. I spend the day here and night in another place. I could 
not even fulfill her last desire. I will be greatly repentant 
all my life about it. This shock is very difficult for me to 
bear." 
  Both al-Amin and 'Abd-al-Basit expressed great happiness at 
meeting with the editor. This was the first time that an Arabic 
language journalist had paid attention to them and considered 
them worth interviewing. "We are glad that we could share our 
inner thoughts with you and explain our side of the Lockerbie 
accident in details. This is a great honor for us and it makes 
us happy. We have a lot of experience with journalists, and we 
have learned a lot during our meeting with journalists. We also 
know how to answer journalists' questions. Meeting with 
journalists is an interesting experience, and now they seem to 
be members of our own family. Our hearts beat for each other and 
they understand us even when we do not say anything. Anyhow, in 
order to get the facts about the airplane crash and to put this 
thing aside, we want to join our voice with the voice of other 
people, and declare forcefully to the whole world that the 
United States should give up its stubborn attitude. It should 
allow a third and neutral nation to investigate this affair. 
That country should listen to both sides and make a decision. 
The United States is not willing to do that. It shows that it is 
not sure of its stand and knows about its weakness. However, 
since the United States is the world's greatest power now, it 
wants to make its mistake to change into truth. That is why it 
is pressuring Libya and accusing two of its citizens. It wants 
Libya to extradite these two citizens and send them to the 
United States so that they can be hanged. The Americans should 
pay attention to their government's style of operation and how 
it is destroying their nation's prestige. We do not want to 
accuse anyone. We do not even want to say anything in our 
defense at this time. All we want to say is that we should be 
treated fairly." 
  "Five years have passed since the airplane crash. We have 
spent this whole time like being impaled on a stake. We do not 
have the words to describe the pain and agony we have gone 
through. Our time of being tested has not passed yet, and we do 
now know how this suffering will continue. Many airplane 
accidents took place before this one, and many more accidents 
will take place in the future also. However, it never happened 
before that someone was accused without any investigation. The 
whole world knows the U.S. method of operation. The action that 
the United States took in its arrogance as a powerful nation 
after the Pan Am crash was just to pressure Libya. It used some 
tricks and imposed economic sanctions against it so that Libya 
would kneel down in front of it in submission. However, bravo to 
Libya! It is standing firm and is not willing to bow down to the 
United States. You tell us with your hand on your heart if this 
is the standard of U.S. justice and fairness? What will the 
United States do if another nation treats it like this?" 
  "Our position in this whole situation is like another side. 
We know what we did, what we did not do, and what wrong 
allegations are against us. We are not willing to allow the 
United States, Britain, and Scotland to make any decision they 
want and impose it on us. We are willing to accept the decision 
made by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and Tunisia."

  [Text] A responsible source has categorically denied that 
any Arab party is participating in the military operations waged 
by the forces of legitimacy against rebellious secessionists. 
The source described the reports disseminated by the 
secessionist gang that Iraqis are participating in the fighting 
as false, fabricated, and misleading allegations. This gang has 
repeated such fabrications and lies to mislead public opinion 
and gain some Arab and international parties' sympathy, said the 
source. 
  The responsible source added: It is not new to see this gang 
repeating such false allegations on the presence of Iraqis or 
others. Yesterday, the television, which is controlled by this 
gang, showed Sudanese nurse Salah Muhammad Fadlallah and claimed 
that he is a pilot fighting at the side of the forces of unity 
and legitimacy. This allegation was exposed when the gang 
presented the documents of this person who was kidnapped by the 
members of this gang from his work site in one of the medical 
centers in the Lahij Governorate. This person, who has been 
working as a nurse in Yemen for the past five years, was shown 
on the television as a pilot.

  [Text] Moscow, 28 May -- An attempt was made on the life of 
Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev on 27 May. An ITAR-TASS 
correspondent learned this from Chechnya's press and information 
ministry today. 
  The attempt occurred at 1900 hours along the road to Groznyy 
when the motorcade in which the president was travelling passed 
a Lada car parked on the side of the road. The blast from the 
powerful car bomb killed Interior Minister Magomet Eldiyev, his 
deputy Saidali Batayev, and the driver of their car, who were 
accompanying the president. The car in which the Chechen 
president was riding was thrown 10 meters by the explosion, but 
the president was not hurt. 
  ITAR-TASS learned from Shirlai Pashayev, Chechnya's deputy 
minister for information and the press, that components of a 
remote control triggering device were found at the scene of the 
attempt. According to Pashayev, similar devices have not been 
used before on the territory of the Chechen Republic. An 
investigation is under way. 
  A decision was adopted at an emergency sitting of the 
Chechen 
cabinet of ministers today to declare Sunday, 29 May, a day of 
mourning.

  [Excerpt] Groznyy, 28 May -- Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev described yesterday's terrorist act in the republic as 
carefully organized sabotage directed against independent 
Chechnya. He said on local television today that forces opposed 
to the slight thaw in Russo-Chechen relations were behind this 
act. 
  Some details about the terrorist act emerged today. There 
was a powerful explosion at about 2000 local time on 27 May on 
the road between the Chechen settlements of Zakan-Lirk and 
Alkha-Kala just as the president's motorcade was driving past a 
Zhiguli model nine parked at the edge of the road. [passage

  [Excerpt] The Chechen leaders accused Moscow of elevating 
terrorism to the level of state policy, but stated that "under 
no circumstance will they resort to return measures." On 
Monday, the Chechen Foreign Ministry circulated a statement 
which lays the blame for such a policy on the Russian 
authorities. 
  The attempt on the life of President Dudayev on May 27 was 
merely the latest terrorist act carried out by the Russian 
special services over the three years since the Chechen state 
came into existence, says the statement. [passage omitted] 
  "Under the cover of democratic rhetoric, the Russian 
leadership is undermining the sovereignty of Chechnya," says 
this document. "All this is taking place amid reports about 
forthcoming talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
although the Chechen leaders have not received any official 
proposals," says the statement. 
  The Chechen authorities believe that the actual plans of the 
Russian leaders boil down to "backstage contacts between 
Russia's high-ranking officials and dubious figures, who have 
compromised themselves by anti-democratic actions in the Chechen 
Republic," says the document.

  [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that 
Turkey continues to carry out a slanderous campaign against 
Greece and to bring unfounded charges by invoking events which 
are obviously contrary to the reality. The spokesman made the 
above statement when he was asked about the government's comment 
regarding the confession of the Kurdish fighter who was tortured 
by Turkish authorities to say that he had been trained at a camp 
for terrorists in Greece. Once again Venizelos underlined that 
our country will not contribute to the effort to cultivate false 
tension. We call on Turkey, the spokesman said, to stop 
implicating Greece in its internal problems. The Greek state 
authority, Venizelos stressed, controls the whole of its 
territory which is open and accessible to everyone, especially 
to journalists. Finally, the government spokesman expressed the 
government's regret for the confirmation of brutal violation of 
human rights, such as in the case of detained persons subjected 
to torture to sign forged confessions.

  [Text] Muslim youth from various ethnic groups in Serbia's 
Sandzak province are being brought secretly to Turkey and 
trained at Urla and Foca. The first group arrived in 1993 for 
commando training by Turkish officers. It has been ascertained 
that 754 young men have gone through this training since the 
beginning of 1994. At present 500 young men are being trained 
at Urla. After completing their training, they returned to 
Sandzak and were told "to bomb various government buildings and 
assassinate political figures." 
  The parents of the young men are told that "they are going 
to 
attend higher educational institutes in Turkey." But the 
parents do not know what their sons are doing in Turkey or which 
school they are attending. The only liaison for them in Turkey 
is the Sandzak Intelligence Center in Ankara. It is said that 
this center is being run by the General Secretariat of the 
[Turkish] National Security Council [NSC]. 
<H5>  Murat Bayrak's Planes </H5>
  The young men picked up from the various regions of Sandzak 
are assembled at the Macedonian capital Skopje [Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Here, they are given "pocket 
money" of 300 to 500 DM [Deutsche Mark] on behalf of the 
President of Sandzak Suleyman Uglanin [name and title as 
published], and then they are flown to Izmir on planes from 
Sandzak Airlines, which belongs to Murat Bayrak's son Mustafa 
Bayrak. It is also said that Murat Bayrak is contributing 
financially to this project. It is stressed that Bayrak, who is 
from Sandzak, has contacts with Suleyman Uglanin. 
  AYDINLIK made inquiries with Murat Bayrak in Bonn and 
Mustafa 
Bayrak in Istanbul on this matter. There were no replies from 
either Bayrak when our paper went to press. 
<H5>  A Deputy's Confessions </H5>
  This came into the open with the publication of confessions 
by Harun Hacic [name as published], a deputy at the former 
Sandzak Autonomous Parliament, in the October 1993 issue of 
ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA magazine, which is published in Serbian in 
Belgrade and sold in European cities. Hacic was caught 
red-handed during the operation carried out by the Yugoslav 
police at the beginning of 1993 to detain the young people 
trained as commandos in Turkey and organizers of the project. A 
considerable amount of arms and military hardware that were 
buried in his garden were seized. Following an exhaustive 
interrogation of Hacic, the Sandzak police detained 80 people. 
The interrogation of the detainees has been continuing over the 
past year. ZAMAN and MILLI GAZETE [both published in Turkey] 
have been campaigning for the last two weeks for the detained. 
<H5>  U.S.-Saudi-Ozal Operation </H5>
  The first official contact on training the Muslim youths in 
Turkey was made during Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's 
visit to then President Turgut Ozal in Ankara at the end of 1992. 
  Uglanin is the head of the Sandzak branch of Democratic 
Action Party (SDA) of Alija Izetbegovic, the president of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina. SDA is supported by Saudi Arabia and the 
United States. 
  The project of training the Sandzak Muslims in Turkey is 
part 
of a plan to create "a Muslim state in parts of Serbia and 
Montenegro." This also complies with the views of Izetbegovic's 
party, which is active in Sandzak. It was the United States 
that put forward the plan to establish a Muslim state in Europe. 
Saudi Arabia is openly supporting it. Besides, Turkey's secret 
diplomacy on Balkans is being financed by Saudi Arabia. 
  Deputy Hacic, whose confessions have already been published, 
is Sandzak President Suleyman Uglanin's right-hand man. In his 
statement he said that "it was Uglanin who first told me about 
the groups to be dispatched to Turkey." He said Uglanin 
explained the aim behind the action as thus: "At first, to 
secure a special status for Sandzak, and then to form an 
independent Muslim Sandzak step-by-step." 
  Sandzak is a multiethnic and multidenominational autonomous 
region between Macedonia and Kosovo. The spreading of war to 
heavily Muslim populated Sandzak or Kosovo would create a 
regional crisis engulfing Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and 
Macedonia. The United States is banking more and more on using 
Turkey in its plans with Muslims in the Balkans. The statement 
of Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, said that "we have 
the largest army in the region, and have gained experience in 
guerrilla warfare," meaning that the Balkan and Caucasian wars 
are not regular but guerrilla warfares. 
<H5>  Kahramanyol Is the Leading Man </H5>
  Mustafa Kahramanyol heads the activity providing Sandzak 
youth with commando training in Turkey. Kahramanyol, who is 
from Sandzak, is an expert on the Balkans Desk of the NSC 
General Secretariat and is also an adviser in the prime 
minister's office. After a long pause, Kahramanyol replied to 
AYDINLIK's questions by saying: "I am a government official, I 
cannot comment on this issue." 
  Hacic's confession published in ILUSTROVANA POLITIKA 
includes 
names of the organization's members: Sokol Ahmetovic [name as 
published], the responsible official in the city of Yeni Pazar 
[Novi Pazar], who organizes the contact with the young men. 
Cemal Kolasinatz [name as published] is one of the former 
Yugoslav army officers. Kolasinatz arranges the travel of the 
groups to and from Turkey. 
  [The article is accompanied by a picture that shows a group 
of people squatting in a field handling pistols. The caption 
says: "The special warfare official Lieutenant Colonel Korkut 
Eken, who was expelled from the organization after the incident 
involving MIT, National Intelligence Organization, heads the 
Urla camp where the Special Army is being trained. Foca camp 
specializes in commando training. The special warfare officials 
are organizing the training in both camps."]

  [Excerpts] Cooperation between the antiterrorist services 
and U.S. teams that are participating in the efforts to 
dismantle the 17 November terrorist organization will be 
changing. 
  The amendment of the cooperation status with the Americans 
is 
one of the three parts included in the reorganization of the 
Antiterrorist Service (IAEV) [expansion unknown]. 
  According to a police source, Greek authorities were not 
satisfied with the cooperation with the Americans because they 
were only taking information without providing any. Thus, the 
Greek officers often felt like investigative employees for the 
Americans, who continued their investigations after every 
terrorist action without providing any information. 
  Of course, the cooperation with the Americans will not be 
suspended, but there will be an effort to become equal. The 
Greek authorities need U.S. assistance, in means and 
information, which until now had not been sufficient. 
  The issue of equal cooperation was raised by Minister of 
Public Order Stilianos Papathemelis during his visit to the 
United States two months ago. He received assurances that the 
cooperation would be improved. 
  The other two parts of the reorganization provide for the 
establishment of a group of 15 to 20 scientists with various 
specialties, who will be advising the director of the 
antiterrorist staff, and for more flexible operations of the 
existing four departments of the service. 
  The scientific staff, in English called a think-tank 
(reservoir of thought) will be manned by experts who specialize 
in analyzing leaflets, economists, sociologists, electronic 
translators, and analysts of information from foreign and local 
publications, and so forth. [passage omitted] 
  The third and last part of the reorganization aims at 
disengaging those serving in inactive departments of the 
antiterrorist unit and greater coherence and flexibility among 
the four departments of the antiterrorist service. The service 
is expected to operate in its new form by the summer, while any 
pertinent decisions [not specified] are expected to be announced 
officially in the next few days.

<F P=106> [Article by Kostas Kiriakopoulos: "These Are Not Just Easter </F>
Firecrackers"] 
  [Text] When these days the neighborhood calmness is broken 
by the noise of explosions, our mind goes to the colorful Easter 
firecrackers. 
  Yet, in the first four months of 1994 we heard other 
"terrorist" explosions since 17 November, the "Revolutionary 
Peoples Struggle" [ELA] and their other kinsmen moved several 
times through the dark streets of Athens leaving their explosive 
identification mark. 
  Since the beginning of the year, 17 November made its 
appearance three times, according to the evidence, and ELA five 
times. It may be noted that the organizations have not assumed 
responsibility for those attacks by issuing proclamations, but 
the ELA made telephone calls. This was a usual terrorist 
activity, not a drastic increase as originally thought, since 
during the same four-month period in 1993, 17 November struck 
seven times and ELA struck four. Almost the same applies in the 
case of ELA for the same four-month period in 1992--ELA acted 
five times while 17 November remained completely inactive. 17 
November apparently suspended its activities in the first months 
of 1992 following the encounter with the police on Louizis 
Rankour Street. But by the end of 1992 it had acted four times, 
starting with the murder of Thanos Axarlian during the rocket 
attack against Yiannis Palaeokrassas. 
<H5>  Was It a Failure? </H5>
  The officers of the antiterrorist units, assessing the 
"quality and quantity" of the various "strikes," observe that 
although the number of actions is approximately the same as 
those during the previous two years, there is indeed an increase 
after many months of "quietness." The bloody game of Greek 
terrorism does not stop. Let us not forget that 17 November 
started its season this year with the cold-blooded murder of 
Mikh. Vranopouloas. Later, it attacked two insurance companies, 
the American "Alico" which has been in the Greek marketplace and 
the Dutch "Nationale Nederlande" for 30 years. It was at that 
time that the failed rocket attack on the British carrier "Ark 
Royal" became known. It was noted that if the two rockets were 
launched from the Piraeus small lot and had hit the ship, the 
diplomatic and political consequences for our country would be 
hard to foretell. It would have been the organization's most 
spectacular strike. 
  The policemen, however, have certain reservations and wonder 
whether the action did indeed fail. The two rockets were placed 
some 200 meters from the target, a distance which is an 
impediment to effectiveness, as shown by other strikes. Some 
imply that after the "easy and secure" strikes against the 
insurance companies, the organization sought to impress not only 
the Greek public opinion. 
<H5>  The Targets Are "European" </H5>
  With the exception of "Alico," all the targets of 17 
November 
and ELA had a purely European character. This is certainly 
related to the UN activities in the Balkans and the troubled 
area of Bosnia. If one should accept the theories which hold 
that the terrorist actions affect or are related to certain 
governmental actions at the diplomatic, political, social, and 
business level here and abroad, he will see the summit 
conference of the EU leaders, which will take place in 
approximately two months in Corfu. He will see the effort to 
attract foreign investors to Greece; the opening of the tourist 
period; the prime minister's visit to the United States; the 
treatment of Kurds in European countries such as Germany. 
  It is assumed that the bomb attacks on the German [Company] 
"Miele" (by 17 November) in the building also housing the UN 
High Commissioner and on the Greek office on refugees which 
works with the UN (by ELA) are directly related to the Kurdish 
issue and its repercussions in Europe. These assessments come 
mostly from the political leadership of the Ministry of Public 
Order, not the "operational" echelons of the Greek police. As 
for the selection of the targets, the Attiki Security 
antiterrorist unit admitted indirectly that "it was almost taken 
by surprise." During the period with the largest number of 
terrorist actions, the major political issue was the reaction of 
the "productive classes" to the government-sponsored tax bill. 
Naturally, the police had taken extraordinary measures to guard 
the tax collection offices and state financial agencies, having 
in mind last year's avalanche of bombs and rockets against tax 
collection offices, as well as against tax collection officials' 
cars, especially directors. The discovery of the two rockets 
aimed at the British carrier gave an opportunity to assess 17 
November's armory. Police officials believe that this 
organization has used up almost half of its rockets during 17 
attacks with 2.36-inch and 3.5-inch antitank missiles stolen in 
December 1992 from the storage area of the Sykourio military 
camp in Larisa. The National Defense Ministry had reported at 
that time that the terrorists had stolen 60 to 65 rockets. They 
have now "used up" more than 30. 
<H5>  The Others </H5>
  In a recent TV interview, Public Order Minister St. 
Papathemelis said that ELA is simply the tail of 17 November. 
This is nothing new since, for years now, the prevailing theory 
in the headquarters of the antiterrorist service is that of 
"communicating vessels" regarding the two major organizations. 
However, after a given action by ELA, we see other anarchist 
groups attacking party offices, state-owned cars, police 
officers, banks, and security services. These groups, known also 
as the stooges of the terrorists, apply the tactic of assuming 
responsibility for a given action by telephone. During recent 
years, 16 such groups have been active mainly in Athens but also 
in Salonica. Among those groups, we have the "Anarchist Group 15 
May," "Rabid Anarchists," "Anarchists Beyond Detection," and 
others that gain their "revolutionary mantle" after a specific 
terrorist attack. Be that as it may, their bombs are not Easter 
firecrackers either.

  [Text] Five copies of a leaflet signed by a group calling 
itself "The Armed Group for the Proletarian Revolution -- The 
New Walter Alasia Column" have been found in the city of Genoa. 
The leaflets contained threats against President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Gianfranco Fini 
[secretary of the National Alliance], Achille Occhetto 
[secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left], and Bruno 
Trentin [general secretary of the CGIL confederated trades 
union]. 
  According to police sources, the leaflets call for the 
resumption of the fight against capitalism and the traditional 
parties, and even against other extreme left-wing groups, which 
are defined as being "incapable of leading the class struggle." 
  The investigators are examining the reliability of the 
leaflet and the group's symbol, which is unknown.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Red Brigade Leaflets Against </F>
Scalfaro and Berlusconi in Genoa"] 
  [Text] Genoa -- Five leaflets signed by a self-styled 
"Armed Group for the Proletarian Revolution -- New Walter Alasia 
Column" were found yesterday morning in Genoa, in the 
Sampierdarena section, a stone's throw from the place where the 
Red Brigades murdered two Carabinieri, Tosa and Battaglin. 
  The leaflets contained heavy threats against President Oscar 
Luigi Scalfaro, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, National 
Alliance [AN] leader Gianfranco Fini, and League leader Umberto 
Bossi. Death threats were also addressed to CGIL [Italian 
General Confederation of Labor] Secretary General Bruno Trentin, 
and PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] Secretary Achille 
Occhetto. The document, which was most probably written with an 
electronic typewriter and then photocopied, is currently being 
examined by the DIGOS [Division for General Investigations and 
Special Operations]. Is it some sort of provocation? Possibly, 
but the police is not discarding the very real possibility of a 
new terrorist flare-up. 
  The leaflets' presence in Via Rolando, in Sampierdarena, was 
reported to the police by passers-by who noticed two of the five 
leaflets affixed -- at eye level -- on the front of a house. 
The other three leaflets were glued to a paper-collecting 
container. An eye-catching five-point star was displayed on the 
upper left-hand side of the leaflets. The five-point star is 
BR's [Red Brigades] "historical" symbol on which, however, the 
outline of a submachine gun was superimposed. Around this, in a 
radiating pattern, was the "signature" of the self-styled "armed 
group." 
  According to the leaflet, it is "the oppressive and 
exploitative state structure" which justifies the resumption of 
armed struggle. This includes executing Trentin and Occhetto, 
who are accused of "collaborationism with the 
counterrevolutionaries and the bosses' clique," as well as of 
"sabotaging proletarian actions." 
  The "New Walter Alasia Column" pronounces the same sentence 
on Bossi and Berlusconi, who are targeted "because they are 
enemies of the working class and of its armed organization," and 
on Fini and Scalfaro, in that they are considered adherents of 
party organizations which openly support neofascist ideology.

  [Text] Madrid, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Four shots fired by a man and 
woman ended the life Army Brigadier General Juan Jose Hernandez 
Rovira, the victim of a terrorist attack carried out today in 
Madrid. 
  The attack took place at 0845 (0645 GMT) as the general was 
leaving his home, located in a Salamanca neighborhood in the 
center of Madrid. A resident of a building near the site of the 
attack told EFE the general, the father of six children, lost 
his wife last year. Municipal police sources told EFE that 
after the shooting the general, who was still alive, was taken 
to a hospital but died on arrival. 
  The ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] terrorist group 
carried out the most recent attack in Madrid, on 23 May. In 
that incident, an engineer lieutenant was killed by a car bomb 
explosion. On Sunday in the northern Basque country, three 
persons were wounded when bombs concealed in two purses 
exploded. The Vizcaya Civil Government attributed that attack 
to ETA.

morning's attack are "salaried" members of Commando Madrid. The 
kind of attack suggests that Arizkuren Ruiz, Aguirre Lete, and 
Soledad Iparraguirre Guenechea may have been involved. 
  These same Basque Fatherland and Liberty [ETA] members are 
allegedly responsible for the death of General Dionisio Herrero 
last October. Two of them may have committed nine other attacks. 
  Defense Minister Garcia Vargas has asked the public at large 
as well as the media for help in finishing off with terrorism. 
"We fear the worst, that ETA has a stable infrastructure in 
Madrid," he added.

  [Text] ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] is demanding 
between 10 and 15 million pesetas from businessmen and 
professionals in Guipuzcoa as payment of the revolutionary tax. 
This is what is reported today in LA VANGUARDIA. The newspaper 
says that the terrorist group is threatening Basque businessmen 
with reprisals should this latest attempt at extortion be 
reported to the police. The criminal organization says that it 
has complete personal data on these businessmen that will be 
used against them should they refuse to make payments.

  [Text] The photograph that the newspaper SABAH published 
last Tuesday under the headline "Dirty Alliance!" exposed this 
paper's ties with the "intelligence units" and how it is being 
used by these circles. [Text of SABAH article appears as item 
NC2605092094 in previous Terrorism Report] 
  It has been ascertained that the photograph of PKK [Kurdish 
Workers Party] leader Abdullah Ocalan and M. Yohanna, the Syriac 
Metropolitan of Aleppo, Syria, was part of the archives that 
were seized during the 10 December 1993 police raid on the paper 
OZGUR GUNDEM, whose publication was banned last month by the 
Supreme Court. 
  SABAH resorted to an unbelievable lie to "prove" 
PKK-Armenian 
cooperation. It began its front page report on 24 May issue 
with the following statement: "`PKK-Armenian cooperation,' 
which Turkish Governments have known about for years and which 
was being denied particularly by pro-PKK circles, has finally 
been confirmed with specific documents." Claiming that after 
prolonged work by the Turkish intelligence units, PKK-Armenian 
cooperation was proven by photographs, SABAH asserted that the 
priests of the Armenian Gregorian [Apostolic] Church met with 
Ocalan in al-Biqa', and that the extremist nationalistic 
Armenian Tashnak [Armenian Revolutionary Federation] Party has 
been providing arms and financial assistance to the PKK through 
the church. It also claimed that Ocalan wants to find shelter 
in Armenia and that Armenians play an important role inside the 
PKK. 
  It has now been determined that the Ugur Sefkat's report 
accompanying the photograph, which the paper described as a 
'document,' is a complete lie. 
  The priest standing near PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is 
described as an "Armenian priest." But in actual fact, the man 
on the photograph is M. Yohanna, the Syriac Metropolitan in 
Syria. 
  The second lie concerns the date. The date of the meeting, 
which took place between Ocalan and Yohanna on 10 March 1993 and 
which was then distributed to subscribers by KURD-HA and which 
was published in the monthly magazine OZGUR HALK in Turkey in 
July 1993, has been 'changed' to 3 May 1994. 
  What SABAH called a 'secret' meeting was fully published in 
a 
monthly paper that anyone can buy and read in Turkey. 
  According to SABAH's "news," following a tip off about the 
meeting of the Armenian priests with Ocalan, the Turkish 
intelligence officials went into action and photographed the 3 
May 1994 meeting. However, no explanation was given as to why 
Ocalan was wearing a winter overcoat in May, as shown in the 
photograph. 
<H5>  The Photograph Comes From OZGUR GUNDEM's Archives </H5>
  This photograph, under which some concocted information has 
been sprinkled and which was supposedly taken by the Turkish 
intelligence officials, was "seized" during the police raid on 
OZGUR GUNDEM on 10 December 1993. 
  The report, which was published in the magazine OZGUR HALK 
and which, together with the photograph, was transmitted to 
OZGUR GUNDEM on the same day by KURD-HA, said that M. Yohanna, 
the Syriac metropolitan of Aleppo in Syria, paid a 
familiarization visit to PKK leader Ocalan on 10 March 1993 in 
Barr Ilyas in Lebanon. M. Yohanna and Ocalan discussed the 
problems of the Syriacs in South Kurdistan [Iraqi Kurdistan] and 
in the Mardin region and conversed on the common history of 
Assyrians and Kurds. 
  In the meantime, the press secretary of the Armenian 
Patriarchate in Istanbul told a television station that the 
attire of the priest on the photograph is not that worn by the 
Armenian priests and that no such meeting took place. 
  [SABAH's photograph appears to be an altered version of the 
photograph of Ocalan and M. Yohanna published on page 16 of the 
15 May 1993 issue of BERXWEDAN as part of a report on a meeting 
between these two persons. The SABAH photograph seems to have 
airbrushed some background details and eliminated a third person 
standing beside Ocalan and Yohanna. Nicosia Bureau processed the 
BERXWEDAN item in May, 1993.]

  [Text] A total of 1,168 terrorists have been killed in 
operations conducted in the state of emergency region in the 
last two months. A total 172 terrorists have surrendered during 
the same period. 
  The regional governors' meeting, in which public order and 
security issues of the provinces within the state of emergency 
region were discussed, was held in Siirt. Turkish Radio and 
Television correspondent Cahit Beyazsac reports that State of 
Emergency Governor Unal Erkan, addressing the meeting, said that 
866 collaborators were captured in operations conducted in the 
region. 
  [Begin Erkan recording] The separatist terror organization 
was dealt a heavy blow during the last two months. Most of its 
weapons, ammunition, foodstuffs, clothing, medicine, and other 
supplies were confiscated. The terror organization undertook 
many armed assaults killing 241 of our citizens, 204 men, 16 
women, and 21 children. [end recording] 
  Erkan called on the terrorists on the mountains to benefit 
from the current repentance bill and surrender without any 
further delay. He stressed that there is no other way out. He 
recalled that the terror organization, which is in a difficult 
position, is forcing some of the regional people to emigrate to 
northern Iraq through promises of jobs and money. He added that 
the terror organization is trying to portray Turkey as a state 
in which human rights are violated in the eyes of the United 
Nations and the European countries. Erkan said that of the 
unsolved cases, 301 have so far been solved. He added that 
another 61 unsolved cases, including 34 murders and 17 assaults 
undertaken by the illegal organization known to the public as 
Hezbollah have also been solved.

<F P=106> [Tolga Sardan report: "Iran Supports Turkey's Military </F>
Operations"] 
  [Text] Ankara--It has been ascertained that four Iranian 
battalions have been supporting Turkish military operations 
against the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] militants on the Agri 
and Tendurek Mountains for some time now. 
  A MILLIYET correspondent has been informed that the security 
forces know that several PKK militants crossed into Iran after 
being pressed down by the military forces' operations carried 
out in the Agri and Tendurek Mountains over the past four 
months. Acting on that information, the Internal Affairs 
Ministry officials asked their Iranian counterparts to establish 
a "control line" [kontrol hatti] in the region. Earlier, the 
Iranian Administration promised to support Turkey's struggle 
against the PKK. This promise was made during the joint 
security committee meetings between the two countries. 
Considering Turkey's request, Iran transferred four battalions 
to an area in the vicinity of the Agri and Tendurek Mountains to 
maintain security along the border between the two countries 10 
days ago. 
  The officials disclosed that the measures taken by the 
Iranian military forces along the border have prevented the PKK 
groups, which have sustained severe blows in the mountainous 
region, from crossing into Iran. A high-ranking official said 
Iran's support was very important for the "mop up" operations. 
He asserted: "Iran's transfer of troops to the operations zone 
was a second gesture by that country. That is an indication 
that the relations between the two countries on security matters 
are improving." 
  It should be recalled that Iran arrested a group of PKK 
militants and handed them over to Turkey some time ago.

<F P=106> [Wilhelm Dietl/Frank Siering report: "Right in the Face"] </F>
  [Text] Adil Arslan, 33, from Krefeld refused to come. Then 
his visitor took out a 7.65-mm pistol and fired six times, 
several times right in his face. Arslan collapsed with severe 
injuries. 
  Arslan is a Kurd. The perpetrator is also a Kurd. The 
attack was ordered by the banned Workers Party of Kurdistan 
(PKK). The brutal attempted assassination reveals the new 
violent methods of the PKK. Arslan was supposed to die because 
he wanted to drop out. Insiders report that the 33-year-old man 
"lost his faith in the cause of Kurdistan." 
  Arslan is not an unknown person. He belonged among the best- 
known PKK functionaries in Germany. Together with 24 of his 
comrades, he was charged with membership in a terrorist 
association and criminal acts connected with it. In 1992 the 
Celle Higher Regional Court sentenced him to four years and two 
months in prison for severe deprivation of liberty and dangerous 
bodily injury. Arslan was released on probation. 
  Intelligence officers interpret Arslan's attempted 
assassination as a clear sign from Kurdish leader Abdallah 
Ocalan. Even after the PKK ban, he controls his adherents in 
Germany from Damascus, Syria. They are not to be intimidated 
despite the ban. And increasingly frequent attacks support his 
demands. 
  Flashback: In April the PKK started militant actions against 
travel agencies arranging holidays in Turkey. It threatened 
personal attacks on German visitors to Turkey. In Bensheim in 
Hesse the windowpanes of a travel agency were broken. 
Afterward, consulates and superhighways were occupied. The 
dramatic climax occurred when two women set themselves on fire 
on the occasion of the Kurdish spring festival in Munich. 
  In addition to this new wave of violence, a confidential 
analysis of the Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) 
proceeds from "increasing participation of German left-wing 
extremists" in the PKK actions. In order to give a "signal 
against the daily peaceful financing of the Turkish regime," 
autonomous persons glued the locks of several travel agencies in 
Hannover with super glue. According to a BKA member, 
threatening letters and letters with confessions from so-called 
leftist autonomous persons have lately arrived in the police 
headquarters in Wiesbaden more and more often. 
  The investigators of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Office of 
Criminal Investigation scored a success in the latest 
investigations against the PKK. Five presumed PKK members were 
arrested. The public prosecutor is conducting investigations 
against the suspects, among other things, because of attempted 
killing, extortion, kidnapping, armed blackmail, bodily injury, 
and support of or membership in a banned association. 
  The arrested men are said to be part of a gang that 
collected 
"protection money" on behalf of the PKK. The police 
investigation group for state security/terrorism conducted 
investigations in the PKK surroundings for months. The result: 
In the greater Stuttgart area, the PKK men presented themselves 
to innkeepers and called on the victims "to donate money," in 
order to finance "the Kurds' struggle for freedom" against the 
Turkish state. According to the police, the required sums 
amounted to up to 50,000 German marks in the case of monthly 
payments. 
  If the innkeepers refused to pay, a raiding squad turned up. 
Armed with iron bars, timbers, baseball bats, and pistols, the 
PKK activists would lie in wait for their victims in their 
apartments or near their cars -- and strike brutally. 
  This action against the PKK -- during the subsequent search 
of apartments the investigators found "receipts of donations," 
firearms, and knives -- shows that the PKK is still active in 
Germany despite the ban -- so active that their own people are 
also killed if they want to drop out. Adil Arslan can tell you 
a thing or two about that. He is still suffering from the 
severe gunshot wounds inflicted on him by his "friend and 
comrade."

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has declared that, as 
planned, the government is step by step approaching the 
conclusion the nation is yearning for in the struggle against 
terrorism. Ciller addressed her party's assembly group meeting 
today. 
  In her statement, Ciller reported that the organization's 
balance has been totally upset as a result of the blows dealt to 
the bandits both inside and outside the country in a planned, 
systematic, and determined manner. The initiative has been 
placed in the hands of the state forces at every point, Ciller 
announced, stressing that the separatists, who suffered a 
significant loss of personnel, are in a state of moral collapse. 
Under these circumstances, Ciller explained, there has been a 
300 percent increase in the number of terrorists fleeing the 
organization or surrendering to the security forces of their own 
free will. She remarked that the PKK [Workers Party of 
Kurdistan] has totally lost the people's support and is 
therefore trying to recruit militants by the use of force and 
violence. 
  Pointing out that the terrorists are trying not to engage in 
large-scale clashes with the security forces that will result in 
heavy losses, the prime minister said that it was learned that 
heavy pressure is being applied and horrible executions are 
taking place within the organization in a bid to prevent 
desertions. Ciller revealed that the terrorist organization's 
logistics support and warehouses of provisions have largely been 
destroyed. 
  Ciller announced that the developments in northern Iraq, 
which are very important for Turkey's national security, are 
also being followed carefully. All necessary steps and measures 
are being taken to prevent events from taking a turn that may 
threaten Turkey's interests, Ciller stated. Noting that there 
is full agreement and cooperation with Iran concerning the 
antiterror struggle, the prime minister disclosed that there are 
signs that certain neighboring countries are still supporting 
terrorism. 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I want to clearly say the following 
to them: You reap what you sow. I especially recommend that 
they learn this Turkish proverb. Furthermore, I remind them 
that such behavior does not comply with the concept of a serious 
and honorable state. [end recording] 
  In the 270 terrorist incidents that occurred over the past 
two weeks, Ciller explained, 314 terrorists were killed and 122 
terrorists were caught, while only 50 members of the security 
forces were martyred. She underlined that it is evident that 
the past 10- month period yielded more effective results than 
the past 10 years. 
  Ciller explained that the bandits urged innocent 
Kurdish-origin citizens to immigrate to north Iraq by the use of 
force and various lies and they now wish to use this as a means 
of propaganda against Turkey at the United Nations and in world 
public opinion. In this way, Ciller noted, the bandits are 
trying to bring foreign political pressure to stop the 
operations in the region and to secure safe havens for 
themselves. 
  The prime minister announced that the PKK, which is 
beginning 
to crumble inside the country, has adopted the strategy pursued 
by ASALA [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in 
the past, of dragging the struggle into the international arena 
and onto a human rights level. Ciller recalled, however, that 
all the citizens in Turkey are equal and this is guaranteed by 
the Constitution and the laws. Pointing out that the citizens, 
who were forced at gunpoint to immigrate to northern Iraq, are 
now hungry and destitute, Ciller continued: 
  [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on these citizens not 
be instrumental in the plots of the terrorist organization, not 
to succumb to it, and to immediately return to their motherland 
and homes. I hope that everyone will notice and understand that 
the terrorists' real goals are not related to the interests of 
the regional population and that the organization itself is a 
tool in the hands of known foreign centers. A large sector of 
youths -- mostly mere children -- who have been instigated into 
undertaking terrorist acts against their state and who have been 
driven to the mountains by a handful of traitors -- who are 
leading a safe and luxurious life abroad -- are not actually 
aware of who and what goal they are serving. 
  I would like to remind them once again that they have only 
two options and no other ways out. I say to them: Come and 
surrender to the compassionate hands of the state. We will 
treat you with the compassion of a state and a mother. You 
either opt for this alternative, or we will end up with youths 
who will die in security force operations with the stamp of 
traitor on their foreheads. I genuinely feel the compassion and 
sorrow of a mother. I am again calling on all our youths. I am 
again appealing on all the mothers and fathers: Let us embrace 
our children. Let us together prevent them from pursuing a 
dead-end road. [end recording]

  [Text] There was a new provocation yesterday by fanatic 
Islamists against the Ecumenical Patriarchate at Fanari, 
Istanbul, on the eve of the conquest of Constantinople. An 
Islamic organization placed three powerful time-bomb devices, 
which fortunately were discovered in time and dismantled. The 
Greek Government reacted strongly through its spokesman. 
  Commenting on the placement of the three bombs at the 
Ecumenical Patriarchate and Ankara's claims about the so-called 
training of PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in Greece, 
Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said that the 
Greek Government is following the continuing Turkish tension and 
provocations with self-restraint. Especially on the latter 
issue, Venizelos stressed that Turkey's claims are close to 
being ridiculous, and called on the Turkish Government to stop 
exporting, has he put it, its political problems and respect the 
rules of Western civilization and international law. 
  New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert, who is touring 
Pieria, said that he does not consider the planting of bombs at 
the Ecumenical Patriarchate a serious issue, but described the 
statement by the Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman that Greece 
is training PKK members as suspicious. 
  Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras today said that 
the Turkish Government has an obligation to take all necessary 
measures for the protection of the Orthodox Ecumenical 
Patriarchate at Fanari. The knowledge that the Orthodoxy's 
unity is symbolized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate leads to 
extremist statements, along with the Kurdish issue which is 
dividing Turkey, Samaras stressed.

<F P=106> [Report Profiling Female Sinn Fein Leader in Belfast, Una </F>
Gillespie, Including an Interview With Her, by David McKittrick; 
date not given] 
  [Text] For four years Una Gillespie worked as a full-time 
counsellor and education worker at a rape crisis centre, helping 
women combat domestic violence. She is a former student 
activist, a socialist, a feminist, a campaigner for women's 
rights. 
  She looks and sounds like a left-wing member of the British 
Labour Party, but she is one of Sinn Fein's leaders in Belfast. 
She finds no incongruity in working against sexual violence 
while belonging to a party associated with the IRA. 
  "I don't see it as a contradiction. To me, what they're both 
about is removing the root causes and the attitudes that lead to 
violence. 
  "We're in the middle of a conflict we didn't create -- I was 
seven when the British Army came on the streets. But when 
you've tried every peaceful means and you're just being met with 
violence from the state, I understand why people react with 
violence," she said. 
  Her answer illustrates the great gap that exists between the 
republican perspective and that of most of the rest of the 
world. Non-republicans regard the IRA as an aggressive terrorist 
organisation, but republicans genuinely believe the world is 
attacking them. Their sense of victimhood is profound. 
  Ms Gillespie said: "I would love to live in a peaceful 
society where you didn't have to lock the security gate going up 
the stairs at night, didn't have to have bullet-proof glass on 
your windows, didn't have to worry going out in the mornings if 
somebody is going to shoot you dead." 
  Now 32, she was for two years president of the students' 
union at a teacher-training college in Belfast, then women's 
rights officer for a year. She holds a degree in Anglo-Irish 
literature. 
  "I wasn't that interested in republicanism at primary 
school," she recalled. "It was during the 1981 hunger strike 
that I realised it was easy to talk about South Africa or 
Palestine or Nicaragua or whatever, without looking at what was 
actually happening to people here on our own streets." 
  "That's when I made the connection between the international 
struggles and what was going on here." 
  What morals did she draw from the hunger strike, which led 
to 
the emergence of Sinn Fein as a political force? 
  "It was a lesson in how people can find their own power. I 
find working-class people in England, outside of some of the 
mining communities, are very demoralised. They don't have a 
sense of their own power any more, whereas people here still do 
have -- they organise themselves to fight back for whatever 
rights are left to them." 
  Her involvement in campaigns against the strip-searching of 
female prisoners and against plastic bullets led on to working 
for Sinn Fein. She was recently elected as a Belfast city 
councillor after serving two years on the party executive. She 
has never been jailed or arrested, but says her house has twice 
been raided by paratroops. 
  Sinn Fein reserves six of its 24 executive places for women, 
but few of its councillors are female. Ms Gillespie, who is 
single and has no children, says at election time practically 
all the canvassers are women, but few stand for election. This 
is partly for family reasons and partly because of the danger. 
In the past five years, loyalist groups have killed about 20 
people with Sinn Fein associations; several recent victims have 
been women. 
  "For a long time women in Sinn Fein walked round thinking we 
weren't really targets, that men were a sort of buffer zone 
between us and the loyalists," Ms Gillespie said, "but now women 
are being killed, and that deters a lot of women from standing." 
  Offices she and other Sinn Fein councillors used at Belfast 
City Hall were last week blown up by Protestants. 
  A few years ago the party fleetingly took up a pro-abortion 
position, but this was hurriedly abandoned when it became 
evident that it was a guaranteed vote-loser in Ireland. Ms 
Gillespie is plainly not happy with this. 
  "I'll always argue for a woman's right to choose, but the 
fact is that I'm a member of a party which has a different 
policy. All I can do is work to change that." 
  She said things were changing. "If there are any delegations 
going anywhere now, they'd be very conscious that women have to 
be involved... The party has evolved, but there are still 
attitudes what have to be challenged, there is still a long way 
to go." 
  "Women in Sinn Fein have to fight two sorts of battles -- 
you're fighting the Brits and you're fighting the men in your 
own organisation." 
  Sinn Fein may or may not be about to enter the political 
processes proper: that looks to be some way off. But either 
way, its sizeable pool of activists, many of them women, will 
ensure that it remains a formidable force.

<F P=106> [Michael Cassell article: "Endgame in a Deadly Zone"] </F>
  [Text] For nine years, nearly 2m pounds has been kept 
frozen in the bank account of a well-known local businessman in 
the Irish county town of Navan, once a fortified outpost of 
British sovereignty. 
  The money was allegedly on its way from a Swiss bank to the 
paymasters of the Provisional Irish Republican Army. But it was 
intercepted by the Garda. 
  The 2m pounds was intended to help fund the IRA's armed 
struggle in Northern Ireland, condemned as the "six-county 
prison house" by Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. 
  "The account holder claims it is all legitimate," says a 
high-ranking Garda officer. "But it stays exactly where it is 
until the killing stops." 
  Exactly what happens to the Navan cash when one of the 
world's most intractable conflicts finally ends is low on the 
list of current republican concerns. 
  The recent shadow boxing with the UK government has involved 
matters of much greater moment, such as agreement on the meaning 
of Irish national self-determination and the fate of hundreds of 
convicted IRA prisoners kicking their heels in jail. 
  Ann Anthony, a protestant mother of two from Lurgan in the 
north, could be forgiven for wanting the prisoners to stay where 
they are. This month, with the death toll from 2.5 decades of 
street warfare rising beyond 3,000, the IRA blew up her husband. 
Charge: working as a cleaner at a police station. Penalty: 
death. 
  The cycle of hatred has also cut deep into the flesh of an 
innocent Catholic community caught in the sectarian crossfire. 
Eamon Fox and Gary Convie died together five days after Fred 
Anthony as they tucked into lunchtime sandwiches; 76-year-old 
Roseanne Mallon ended her life alone, at midnight, in a 
bullet-riddled armchair. 
  And yet, in spite of the latest, random murders and the 
cries 
of "no surrender," the 25th anniversary of the deployment of 
British troops in Ulster approaches with hope, not despair, in 
the ascendant. 
  As republicans pick at the Downing Street declaration, a 
document intended to be all things to all parties, a widespread 
belief persists that the end-game is under way. 
  Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster 
Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force, expects 
heightened savagery in the short-term but hopes to see an end to 
most terrorist violence within three years. Jim Molyneaux, 
leader of the Ulster Unionists, reckons the worst could be over 
in a year. Adams himself, who has sounded at his most 
optimistic this week, claims the struggle has entered a new and 
final phase. 
  But the choice between peace and another 25 years of human 
tragedy is testing to the limits the cohesion of hardline 
republicans intent on a 32-county socialist state. In the words 
of a convicted IRA bomber: "Not long ago, the mere idea that 
men married to armed struggle should talk to the Brits would 
have meant a beating. Now even the big boys are into it." 
  Out of sight small groups, united under the "ballot box and 
armalite" creed of Sinn Fein and the IRA -- Adams concedes they 
"draw water from the same well" -- are debating the unthinkable. 
  Could violence, which alone has given the cutting edge to 
the 
Irish question, soon be over? Might it be possible to 
decommission the IRA, the world's most technically advanced 
terrorist organisation? 
  The pressures on the republican movement for a political 
deal 
have intensified since last December's declaration, which united 
London and Dublin in leaving open all options for Ulster's 
future but rejected coercion of one part of the Irish community 
by another. Despite unprecedented publicity for the republican 
case and the platform given to the tactically astute Adams to 
sell his peace agenda, the unbending London-Dublin stance has 
won overwhelming backing. 
  Electoral support in the north for Sinn Fein, which won 
78,291 votes in the 1992 general election (10 per cent of the 
vote) has halved, though the British government stresses it 
recognises the party's modest mandate. In the republic, polls 
suggest the party is backed by barely 1 per cent of voters. 
  Political isolation, however, holds no demons for the 
battle- 
hardened men at the heart of the IRA -- the dominant partner in 
its intimate relationship with Sinn Fein -- who number about 400 
-- with perhaps another 50 key players in the south. It is 
these men, who numbered about 1,000 20 years ago, presided over 
by an Army Executive and a seven-man Army Council, who guard the 
soul of the IRA. 
  They look to Belfast, still the political centre of the 
organisation, for guidance. A northern command structure split 
into 11 operational areas (southern command embraces the entire 
republic) plans attacks mounted by active service units. 
  There are thought to be at least two units currently on the 
British mainland. In Ulster, active service units are supported 
by similar numbers of part-time volunteers blooded in minor 
sorties. Behind the volunteers, within the Catholic strongholds, 
are the supporters who offer safe haven in an estimated 2,000 
homes: "There is always someone to run them a bath to wipe out 
the evidence," says an senior intelligence source. 
  In Ulster border towns such as the largely republican 
Crossmaglen, the British army survives under siege, and lamp 
posts carry mock, triangular signs warning: "Danger: Sniper at 
work." 
  Not all support for the IRA in Ulster is freely given. 
Intimidation of Catholics by Catholics is widespread. On a 
night of terror in April, IRA "punishment" attacks in Belfast 
left one man dead and 16 with gunshot wounds to the legs. 
  Growing sections of the IRA leadership now share a 
conviction 
that the prospect of a glorious victory is as remote as the 
threat of complete defeat. And most grass-roots republicans no 
longer have any stomach for slaughter, as a series of Sinn Fein 
public meetings staged to debate the Downing Street declaration 
made clear. 
  At the same time, the IRA confronts a combined north-south 
assault on its manpower, weaponry and financial resources. In 
the republic, which is spending 200m irish pounds a year to 
bring the IRA to heel, the Garda claims recent arms finds have 
dealt a hammerblow to IRA quartermasters moving arms and 
explosives up to the 282-mile border. 
  With Libya no longer supplying the arms which sustained the 
IRA in the 1980s, fresh sources are proving hard to find. The 
recent exposure by British intelligence of attempts to forge new 
supply links with Iran is a further set-back though, for the 
time being, weaponry is not a problem for the IRA, which has 
stored enough to sustain the fight for another 10 years. The 
IRA arsenal includes more than 600 AK47 rifles, 30 machine guns, 
nine SAM7 missiles, a dozen hand-held, surface-to-surface 
missile launchers, eight flame throwers, hundreds of Webley 
pistols and tons of imported Semtex, Irish security sources say. 
  The organisation's engineering and electronics experts can 
add to the arsenal with home-made devices. Though icing sugar 
and fertiliser are still sometimes mixed to provide a deadly 
cocktail, a bomb factory discovered in Kilcock, near Dublin, 
recently yielded sophisticated equipment. 
  Waging a high-tech war -- the IRA now has electronic devices 
to break into police and army frequencies is expensive. The 
annual cost is estimated by the security forces at up to 7m 
pounds, and the rising number of bank raids in the south 
suggests the books are not balancing. 
  Most IRA income comes from organised in the province and in 
the republic -- a network of racketeering and fraud, which 
ranges from video and audio tape piracy to tax abuse. In the 
eyes of those who fight the IRA, this makes it more of a Mafia 
than an army of liberation and means its activities are unlikely 
to be extinguished by a political settlement. 
  The RUC's C13 anti-racketeering unit, which has overseen 
prosecutions involving nearly 50m pounds destined for IRA 
coffers since 1982, has now been bolstered by a finance unit of 
30 tax inspectors, lawyers and accountants. This unit played a 
large role in the recent joint operation, codenamed "Madronna," 
between police on the British mainland and on both sides of the 
Irish border to nail the sources of IRA financing. Meanwhile, 
in the US, funds for the IRA have been dwindling since the early 
1980s. 
  The combination of political and financial pressures on the 
IRA and Sinn Fein to enter the peace process is not lost on 
elements in their leaderships. But they are acutely aware of 
the dangers of moving too far too fast. "If Adams screws it up, 
he could end up with a bullet in his head," says a senior member 
of the RUC. 
  A majority within the IRA army council is now said to favour 
searching for a political accord, but one which will not oblige 
republicans to endorse the Downing Street agreement. A second 
ceasefire this year has not been ruled out. 
  But, remarked a source claiming to be close to one council 
member: "They know it would be of no use just to sign up 
tomorrow. They first have to bring with them the constituency of 
armed, physical-force tradition people. That will take time, 
carries great dangers and will also need the Brits to play the 
game." A former IRA volunteer indicates the scale of the 
challenge within the organisation: "Sure, we are tired, they 
are tired, everyone's tired. But we'll see them out of the six 
counties or in hell before we give up." 
  There are some in the high command opposed to going further 
down the political road, which historically has always ended in 
traumatic disintegration for republicans. 
  To the hard men of south Armagh, east Tyrone and Fermanagh, 
the only option is to continue to wage a war so sacred as to 
justify the killing of schoolchildren in Warrington, nurses in 
Enniskillen and six-month old infants in Germany. 
  Talk of a split, however, provokes impatience among Sinn 
Fein 
heavyweights such as Martin McGuinness -- publicly branded a 
senior IRA figure by Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland 
secretary. "Do you really think," says McGuinness, "we have 
come this far without ensuring full agreement on our position 
each step of the way. There is no split, there will be no 
split." 
  An RUC intelligence officer agrees: "The name of the game is 
to get people on side and gradually isolate the others." 
  The highest levels of the IRA appear confident that before 
the year-end, the organisation will again be in contact either 
directly or indirectly with the British government. Moreover, 
they believe that, ultimately, they will be able to bring their 
argument to the heart of Whitehall not in a stolen, mortar-laden 
van but in a briefcase. 
  This week London and Dublin offered republicans more time to 
choose between peace and continuing armed struggle. The "Brits" 
say they are more than ready to talk. But there is, first, the 
one precondition: an end to all violence; just 12 weeks of 
peace will do. 
  Like Gerry Adams, who recently quoted Irish poet Patrick 
Galvin to express his wish, London and Dublin, too, "dream of a 
green land without death, a new silence descending, a silence of 
peace."

<F P=106> [Article by Nick Watt and Christopher Elliott: "Queen's </F>
Schedule Obtained by IRA "] 
  [Text] Irish special branch detectives hunting IRA 
terrorists have found in a raid on a Dublin house documents 
setting out the Queen's engagements and personal details of 
senior British Army officers. 
  A six-month schedule of the Queen's engagements was listed 
as 
well as details of the officers' addresses, telephone numbers 
and car registrations, according to reports in a Dublin 
newspaper. 
  Police on both sides of the Irish Sea were playing down the 
significance of the documents last night, as some information is 
understood to be old. However, Special Branch officers at 
Scotland Yard were liaising with their Irish counterparts last 
night. 
  Irish police confirmed yesterday that sensitive documents 
were found during a raid last week on a house used by the IRA in 
Dublin. 
  A spokesman for the Garda said: "We can confirm that we 
found 
certain materials in a raid on a house on the north side of the 
city. Owing to security matters we can't discuss any further." 
  Attempts to make the Queen a priority target would mark a 
departure in IRA policy. Any attack on the sovereign would 
inevitably bring a backlash in Great Britain and Ireland and a 
profoundly adverse reaction abroad, especially in America. 
  However, as reported in The Times yesterday, the 
most recent list to cause serious concern to the police and MI5, 
found two weeks before the mortar attack on Heathrow, included a 
number of fresh targets. It appears that a a number of sites 
associated with the royal family may have been detailed. 
  Hundreds of MPs, judges, senior civil servants and other 
Establishment figures have been put on a high level of alert. 
  Intelligence suggests that the IRA is looking for another 
spectacular terrorist incident in the wake of their Easter 
ceasefire and their rejection of the Downing Street declaration.

"Spy Camera System for Town Hit by IRA Bomb"] 
  [Text] In two weeks the first of 19 security cameras in a 
&pound;305,000 surveillance system will be installed in 
Warrington 
town centre, site of the IRA terrorist bombing that killed two 
children just over a year ago. 
  More than 20 similar town centre surveillance systems have 
already been installed around the country. 
  Shoppers in Airdrie, Bedford, Canterbury, Coventry, Dover, 
Gloucester, King's Lynn, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and 
Northampton are familiar with them. Soon those in Ipswich, 
Glasgow and the London borough of Merton will be too. 
  Inhabitants of Newbury, Berks, will have to wait a little 
longer. Businesses there are proving slow to agree to share 
the cost of the proposed 13-camera scheme with the district 
council. 
  The installation cost is estimated at &pound;200,000 and 
annual 
running costs at &pound;100,000. The council has agreed to pay 
half 
but of 200 town centre businesses approached, only 60 have 
agreed to provide funds. 
  Expansion of the surveillance systems in Glasgow and 
Northampton are also faced with reluctant support from the 
business community. The City Watch Association, which is 
pioneering the 32-camera Glasgow project, raised only 
&pound;250,000, half of what it hoped for. 
  Northampton borough council has spent about &pound;500,000 
on 
one of the largest surveillance schemes in the country, but has 
raised only &pound;20,000 from businesses. It has 105 cameras in 
use -- in the town centre, car parks, bus stations, the train 
station and community centre. 
  The Home Office is meeting half of the total cost for 
Warrington. Elsewhere, local authorities have to find the funds 
themselves. A 20-camera system costs in the region of 
&pound;300,000. 
  But the technology is improving and prices are coming down 
-- 
one of the reasons behind the phenomenal expansion in town 
centre surveillance schemes over the last 12 months.

    Editor's Note: The FBIS Terrorism Desk welcomes 
suscribers' comments and suggestions at (703) 733-5512. 
  Highlights and major incidents in this edition of 
the FBIS Terrorism Report include: 
<H5>  Ecuador/U.S. </H5>
  Two U.S. citizens, both employees of a U.S. oil company, 
were kidnapped or 4 or 5 June in the Amazon region. Police later 
arrested several suspects. 
<H5>  Ecuador </H5>
  The leftist Red Sun group surrendered its weapons to the 
government on 2 June. 
<H5>  Egypt </H5>
  The Interior Ministry cracked down on the Muslim 
Brotherhood organization at the beginning of the month, 
arresting 11 members on charges of attempting to overthrow the 
government. The Brotherhood's deputy supreme guide assured a 
government newspaper that the organization "will not be involved 
in any escalation." 
<H5>  Egypt/Lebanon </H5>
  According to Beirut's AL-SHIRA' magazine, Egypt is trying 
to gather information about meetings between Egypt's al-Jihad 
and former Hizballah Secretary General Subhi al-Tufayli. 
<H5>  India/UK </H5>
  Three members of the Muslim militant group Harkat-ul-Ansar 
kidnapped two British hikers in Kashmir, demanding that 
Harkat-al-Ansar leaders be released from prison. Other Kashmiri 
militant groups condemned the kidnapping. 
<H5>  Iran/Lebanon </H5>
  Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati met with Hizballah's 
secretary general in Damascus on 4 June. 
<H5>  Italy/U.S. </H5>
  A passerby found a hand grenade in Rome's Villa Borghese 
park several days after President Clinton visited the site. 
Italian police rule out any connection between the grenade and 
Clinton's visit because the area had been checked several times 
during the president's stay. 
  Italian police arrested three foreigners in Caserta (near 
the NATO base) who were holding stolen U.S. passports. The 
arrestees also had notes and addresses in Arabic, counterfeit 
documents, and surveillance maps of the area. 
<H5>  Lebanon/International </H5>
  Expatriate Arabic magazine AL-WATAN AL-`ARABI cites "a 
report by a major Western intelligence organization in Beirut" 
that a "Hizballah commando group has arrived in Germany" to 
kidnap Israeli diplomats in retaliation for Israel's abduction 
of Mustafa al-Dirani. Germany's DER SPEIGEL publishes a similar 
report. 
<H5>  Peru </H5>
  Counterterrorism forces have uncovered a new Shining Path 
element called "Lima-Regional Committee" under the Shining 
Path's Red Path faction. The government blames this element for 
the August 1993 attack on the U.S. Embassy and other actions. 
<H5>  Philippines </H5>
  During a large-scale military offensive against Abu Sayyaf 
Group camps in southern Philippines, the group detonated a bomb 
in Zamboanga City, wounding over 30 people. Several days later, 
"Muslim gunmen" believed to be affiliated with Abu Sayyaf Group

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] There is increasing evidence that the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] could be operating in Mexico. New 
Spanish Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's priority is to 
eliminate ETA terrorism. As for the ETA's presence in Mexico, 
the minister said it does exist and that its members could be 
active. 
  [Begin recording] Belloch: We have suspicions. We 
and the Mexican authorities have nothing more than suspicions. 
We suspect that some of them could be active ETA militants. 
  Unidentified reporter: What do you mean when you 
say active ETA militants? 
  Belloch: They are persons who have connections 
with the criminal organization and are potentially capable of 
providing economic support and could even cooperate with other 
terrorist groups, both in Mexico and Latin America. They could 
be planning to use Mexico as a springboard. The importance of 
Mexico in this regard is evident and they could be tempted to 
use Mexico as they did France. They may want to create an 
operations base with alliances with other forms of terrorism, 
adversely affecting both Mexico and other countries of Central 
America and Latin America. [end recording] 
  He added that he wants to visit Mexico to meet with his 
Mexican counterpart and exchange viewpoints. 
  [Begin Belloch recording] There is great interest in 
visiting 
your country. I would like to have a relationship similar to 
the one we currently have with France in the analysis of this 
topic. I believe it is appropriate to take preventive actions 
instead of waiting for them to consolidate a stable base in 
Mexico, which Spain and Mexico both are evidently not interested 
in. [end recording] 
  Belloch said it is not possible for the ETA to carry out 
attacks in Mexico today, but if the problem is not dealt with 
now, it could do so in the future. 
  The truth is that since last week, when Spanish Justice 
Minister Juan Alberto Belloch traveled to Paris to meet with his 
French counterpart, Charles Pasqua [name as heard], the efforts 
to fight terrorism have been greatly intensified even though 
they had reached a high level in the past few years, especially 
since 1984. In the last few days heavy blows have been dealt to 
the ETA with new arrests.

  [Excerpts] An Iranian bombing suspect denies any 
involvement in a foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli Embassy 
in Bangkok on March 11, saying he was in Phatthaya on that day, 
Metropolitan Police Bureau Commissioner Chaisit Kanchanakit said 
yesterday. 
  Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, however, allegedly implicated two 
other Iranians arrested with him in the southern tourist town of 
Hat Yai on Friday as taking part in falsifying passports, Pol 
Lt-Gen Chaisit said. 
  Shahriarifar and another Iranian suspect, Mohammadi 
Lotfollah, who is still at large, were sought under arrest 
warrants issued by the police last week on charges of conspiring 
to commit premeditated murder, robbery resulting in the death of 
others, and making and possessing explosives. [background 
passage omitted] [see item BK0306124894 in previous Terrorism 
Report] 
  Nine witnesses yesterday identified Hossein, detained at the 
Metropolitan Police Private School in Bang Khen, as the truck 
driver, according to Pol Lt Gen Chaisit. 
  Shahriarifar and his two Iranian friends, Babak Taheri and 
Basr Kazemi, were caught early Friday morning at the Inthra 
Hotel in Hat Yai. 
  A source at an immigration office in Songkhla's Sadao 
district said Shahriarifar held a valid passport issued by Iran 
under the name Pajiri Mahmed and entered Thailand through the 
immigration checkpoint on Thursday. 
  Since Shahriarifar's photo in the passport allegedly looked 
similar to a sketch produced by Lumphini police station and 
distributed to immigration offices across the country, an 
immigration officer advised Hat Yai police to keep a close watch 
on the man who checked-in at the hotel later on Thursday. 
  The source said Shahriarifar had entered and left Thailand 
through the immigration checkpoints in Sadao and Su-ngai Kolok 
districts more than 10 times under different names. 
  The immigration officers, however, earlier could not 
identify 
him because they did not have his photograph. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar, believed to have left 
the country after his failure to allegedly bomb the embassy, 
came back because he had fallen in love with a Thai woman in Hat 
Yai. 
  The suspect also might have thought that the Thai police had 
called off their investigation. 
  Pol Lt-Gen Chaisit said Shahriarifar did not implicate the 
other suspect as being involved in the embassy bombing plot. 
  He said the police found the gang had its command centre in 
Malaysia where one of its leading members had been caught by 
Malaysian police on charges of falsifying documents. 
  The Metropolitan Police Bureau is looking for additional 
witnesses and evidence against Shahriarifar in Bangkok and 
southern provinces. 
  Investigations will be completed in seven days and the 
suspect will then be charged in the Criminal Court, Pol Lt-Gen 
Chaisit said. 
  Metropolitan Police Bureau deputy commissioner Sophon 
Waratchanon dismissed concern that Shahriarifar might try to 
kill himself, saying the suspect did not seem under stress. 
  Neither the Iranian nor the Israeli embassies have contacted 
the police since the arrest of Shahriarifar, he said. 
  Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut said in Cha-am 
yesterday that the car-bomb attempt was connected with some 
"Thai people in Bangkok." 
  "I thought there would be a lot more to come. Something 
strange would happen," Gen. Chawalit said. He did not elaborate. 
  He said the Interior Ministry had told the Iranian Embassy 
that the Thai police were proceeding with the case.

  [Text] Police yesterday arrested another Iranian in 
connection with the abortive truck-bomb conspiracy discovered in 
Bangkok in March. 
  The new suspect was arrested upon arriving Hat Yai Airport. 
Police refused to identify the suspect and would not allow the 
press to cover the arrest. 
  Meanwhile Bangkok police chief Pol Lt Gen Chaisit 
Kanchanakit 
said the other Iranian, who was charged on Friday in connection 
with the conspiracy had sneaked back into Thailand because he 
was involved with a Thai woman. 
  But informed sources said police had not ruled the 
possibility that Hossein Shahriarifar, 26, returned to Thailand 
for a second sabotage attempt. 
  Chaisit said the suspect was "too complacent and thought 
that 
Thai authorities had given up their attempts to catch him". 
  Far was arrested on Friday night at the Inthra Hotel in 
Songkhla's Hat Yai district. 
  The sources also said they believed those involved in the 
plot still had a supply of C-4 plastic explosive hidden some 
where in Thailand and believed to be in the possession of a Thai 
woman. 
  Police have summoned more than 40 witnesses for questioning. 
They have finished interviews with 10 of them, according to the 
sources, who said investigators had been ordered to wrap up 
their inquiries in seven days. 
  The sources added that police had reliable evidence 
indicating that the plot was directed at the Israeli Embassy. 
The evidence includes a bag that is the same as those 
distributed at a Palestinian training camp. 
  Two other Iranians taken into custody during the same raid 
in 
Hat Yai are being held for questioning. 
  Shahriarifar is scheduled to appear in South Bangkok 
District 
Court on June 9.

  [Text] An Iranian arrested as a prime suspect in connection 
with the foiled terrorist truck-bomb plot in March was yesterday 
picked out from a police line-up by six of the seven witnesses 
present, police said. 
  Meanwhile, Police Director General Police General Prathin 
Santipraphop has issued an order dated June 3 for police to 
intensively monitor people suspected to have links with 
international terrorist groups and to tighten security for 
embassies, certain schools, and other key establishments 
following the arrest. 
  Six witnesses were brought one at a time for the 
identification at Lumpini police station and all of them 
independently singled out Hossein Shahriarifar from among seven 
Middle Eastern men presented by police, said South Bangkok 
Metropolitan Police Deputy Commander Police Colonel Dutsadi 
Chaiyanam. 
  The seventh witness, the owner of the company from which the 
truck used to carry the explosives was rented, did not 
participate, saying he had not dealt directly with the man who 
rented the vehicle, but let his employees handle the matter. 
[passage omitted] 
  The taxi motorcyclist who was engaged in the road accident 
that fortunately averted the planned sabotage yesterday 
identified Shahriarfar as the driver of the truck which hit his 
motorcycle, said Dutsadi.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon the Thai ambassador in Tehran 
was summoned to the foreign ministry and handed a note of 
protest by the deputy foreign minister and head of the 
department for southern and eastern affairs. The Central News 
Unit reports this note protested the arrest of several Iranians 
on the trumped-up charges of their attempting to blow up the 
Zionist regime's embassy in Bangkok and also to related 
interviews by Thai officials. 
  In this note of protest, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
demanded an immediate response from the Thai Government and has 
asked for documented proof of the charges brought against the 
Iranian nationals. It has also asked the Thai Government to 
arrange a meeting between officials of the Islamic Republic's 
consulate in Bangkok and the accused.

diplomats stationed in Bangkok granted access to visit the 
suspects, said Mr. Surin. 
  "There was no accusing, no anger or protest," he said. The 
Thai Foreign Ministry has conveyed Iran's message to the 
Interior Ministry, said the deputy minister.

  [Editorial Report] Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on 8 June 
carries an editorial on the arrest by Thai police of three 
Iranian suspects in the foiled attempt to car-bomb the Israeli 
Embassy in March. 
  MATICHON's 800-word, page 2 editorial is entitled: "The 
Arrest of C-4 Bomb Suspects." It urges the police to prove that 
the three arrested suspects are real terrorists and not just 
scapegoats. "Since the suspects are foreigners listed as members 
of international terrorist groups, the government should, in 
order to give more weight to the arrest, seek cooperation from 
the Malaysian Government for more information on the suspects as 
it was found that they once lived in Malaysia. Cooperation from 
Malaysia would enhance Thailand's credibility in doing justice 
to the arrested terrorists," MATICHON says. It also wants the 
government to contact Iran on the issue. "Iran is another 
country which should be able to supply Thailand with information 
about the suspects who hold Iranian passports," says the 
editorial. It adds: "Anyway, we cannot expect much from Iran 
since it is natural that Iran would rather be cautious and try 
to demonstrate that it has nothing to do with activities by 
international terrorist groups." 
  The paper stresses it cannot accept the fact that terrorists 
have chosen to carry out their operations in Thailand. "The 
Thai Government must make it clear to the parties fighting in 
this century-old war of genocide that they cannot carry out 
sabotage in this country thus exposing the Thai people to 
danger. If they want to fight with each other to the last of 
their men, let them do that somewhere else, not in Thailand," 
the paper says. It adds that the Thai Government must also make 
that policy known to those countries which support international 
terrorism, and have them relay the message to terrorists not to 
come to Thailand.

  [Excerpts] The Police Department will make arrangements for 
Iranian diplomats to visit three Iranians arrested in Hat Yai 
last week in connection with an attempt to car bomb the Israeli 
Embassy in Bangkok in March. 
  The Police Department will also ensure that the three 
suspects, now being detained at a police private training school 
in Bang Khen, are in good condition. [passage omitted] 
  According to Pol Gen Phong-ammat, the U.S. Embassy in 
Bangkok 
has asked the Police Department for information about the 
suspects. 
  Somchai Nilaphaichit, a representative of the Muslim Lawyer 
Group, quoted the suspects as saying that they had no 
involvement with the plot to attack the Israeli Embassy and that 
they came to Thailand to do business. 
  Mr Somchai and Charan Malulin, a researcher at Chulalongkon 
University, yesterday visited the three Iranians during which he 
briefed them on Thai laws and the punishment they face if 
convicted. 
  Mr Somchai said [suspect] Babak [Taheri] had allegedly told 
him he was innocent and that the police had no evidence against 
him. 
  He quoted Babak as saying that he would not have come back 
to 
Thailand if he really was involved in the foiled car-bomb plot. 
  [Suspect] Hossein [Shahriarifar], meanwhile, also denied 
involvement, reportedly telling Mr Somchai that he entered 
Thailand to extend his visa since he had a business concerning 
the trade of radio and television sets here. 
  Hossein also denied reports that he had relations with a 
Thai 
woman, Mr Somchai said. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The Iranian Embassy here yesterday called on 
Thai authorities to be more vigilant against what it called 
"Zionist circles" that are trying to damage the prestige of 
Iran, as the court remanded for 12 more days three Iranians 
arrested last week in connection with the truck bomb plot in 
March. 
  The embassy, in a brief statement, said Iran "strongly 
rejects and condemns any act of terrorism against the life of 
innocent people and considers it un-Islamic and inhuman." 
[passage omitted] 
  The three suspects were escorted to the Criminal Court, 
tightly guarded by heavily-armed police commandos, yesterday to 
be remanded for 12 more days as requested by investigators. 
  They were transferred to the Khlong Prem Central Prison for 
detention after the court approved a police request for the 
remand. 
  Investigators said they needed some more time to complete 
the 
questioning of 10 more witnesses and collect evidence to 
substantiate charges against the three in court. 
  They also asked the court to deny any bail request for the 
suspects, fearing they could flee. 
  Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen Sophon 
Warachanon said yesterday he expected the suspects to be charged 
in court in 10 days.

<F P=106> [Report by Rafiq al-Zayn in Nicosia] </F>
  [Text] The question is no longer if Hizballah will 
retaliate for the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, but how it 
will retaliate. Information received by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI a few 
days after the Israeli operation indicates that a quick decision 
was made at the highest levels between Beirut and Tehran, 
following which a commando group was sent to Europe to carry out 
a revenge operation that will grab media headlines and remind 
Israel and the world that Hizballah's arm is long and able to 
retaliate in kind against international terrorism. 
  Three days after the kidnapping of Mustafa al-Dirani, who 
was 
a prominent leader of the Believers Resistance, a report by a 
major Western intelligence organization in Beirut noted that 
Hizballah's threats are very serious this time, and its analysis 
of these threats fit in with the movements on the ground, which 
emphasize that preparations are under way for a powerful strike 
in retaliation against this Israeli operation. 
  The report referred to the activation of a military plan 
that 
had been previously worked out to carry out an operation or a 
series of operations against Israel. 
  The information stresses that the Hizballah leadership 
decided to strike outside Lebanon. This decision was made 
following protracted deliberations and after requesting an 
Iranian green light, which was conveyed by a party's security 
official dispatched to Tehran on Saturday morning, hours after 
the kidnapping. 
  According to the information, the Hizballah 
leadership--which 
emphasized that it is expanding the area of confrontations in 
Lebanon and that it will no longer adhere to restrictions on 
resistance actions--ruled out the idea of carrying out the 
violent retaliation for which it is preparing from the south for 
several reasons: First, to avoid being accused of playing 
Israel's game, which seeks to confuse the internal situation in 
Lebanon and endanger peace through this operation. 
  Second, the party's leadership fears that the retaliatory 
operations would ignite a confrontation between the party and 
the Lebanese authorities, especially since the party has fears 
of such confrontation to implement a plan to liquidate it. 
  The third reason is a regional one that has dangerous 
dimensions. The party's leadership knows that igniting the 
situation in south Lebanon continues to be a redline, especially 
concerning the dangerous results it may have on the peace 
process and the current negotiations. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI's 
information emphasizes that a decision has been made by Bi'r 
al-'Abd, in Beirut's southern suburb [Hizballah headquarters], 
and Tehran to resort to an old-new style of powerful revenge 
outside the country. This will protect Hizballah itself in 
Lebanon, delay confrontation with the government, and offer a 
goodwill gesture, and at the same time will issue a threat of 
strong retaliation that will gain more international media 
attention than a suicide operation in south Lebanon or by firing 
Katyusha missiles at Israel. 
  The information adds that a plan has been worked out to 
carry 
out exciting and major operations against Israeli targets in a 
West European country. It has been emphasized that the 
retaliation should not be an assassination or booby-trapped car, 
but it should be similar to what Israel did, that is to kidnap 
ranking Israeli diplomats from embassies--an ambassador, consul, 
or more--and detain them in a building or a crowded center in a 
manner that incites media clamor and angers and forces 
negotiations with the Israelis through the media. 
  Through this hostage-taking operation, Hizballah seeks quick 
negotiations with the Israeli Government in which it will not 
only demand the release of Mustafa al-Dirani, but all Lebanese 
intellectuals in Israeli prisons, who currently number 350, 
including Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, who was abducted by 
Israel from his house in the south in 1989. 
  Special security sources say that 'Imad Mughniyah, Hizballah 
security officer who currently lives in Tehran and carries an 
Iranian passport, played an important role in preparing for the 
operation and training of the commando group that will carry out 
the operation. Earlier, Mughniyah held intensive contacts and 
meetings in Tehran in the presence of Intelligence Minister 'Ali 
Fallahian, Revolutionary Guard Chief Mohsen Reza'i, and the 
supervisor of the "al-Quds Battalion," which is specialized in 
overseas operations. It is known that 'Imad Mughniyah is one of 
al-Dirani's closest friends. They, together with Husayn 
al-Musawi, were responsible for taking Western hostages in 
Lebanon in the eighties. 
  According to the available information, a four-man Hizballah 
commando group has arrived in Germany to carry out the operation 
as soon as possible. Germany has been selected because of the 
existence of the headquarters of the Iranian terrorist network 
in this country, where Iranian terrorist groups move freely 
thanks to the close relations of cooperation between Bonn and 
Tehran. Taking advantage of these relations, Hizballah formed 
and organized its networks in this country and a number of 
neighboring countries. Hizballah maintains an important 
logistics base in Germany in cooperation with Revolutionary 
Guard elements. It seems that Tehran has given the green light 
for the implementation of the operation in Germany despite its 
relations with it. Besides avenging al-Dirani, Iran wants to 
pressure the Bonn government to keep it from going too far in 
the current trial of perpetrators of the Mykonos restaurant [in 
Berlin] crime, in which four Iranian Party of Kurdistan members 
were killed. Tehran attaches great importance to this trial 
since the suspects are Revolutionary Guard and Lebanese 
Hizballah members. Convicting them would threaten to officially 
prove for the first time that Iran has a role in international 
terror. 
  It has been learned that Tehran has offered all means of 
support to the Hizballah group to carry out the operation. 
However, it has set the condition that the operation should 
take place in the name of Hizballah only, and that not a single 
Iranian thread should appear in it. Actually, the Hizballah 
cells in Germany and Europe have for days been preparing and 
planning for the operation in order to carry it out 
successfully. They are also considering the possibility of 
carrying out similar operations in any other country, should a 
chance become available. Therefore, the Hizballah networks in 
Europe held contacts with fundamentalist Islamic groups in other 
countries to help them secure logistical support. They also 
asked radical Palestinian groups that are known to have a 
presence in more than one capital to contribute to taking 
revenge on Israel. According to the latest information, when 
these lines were written last weekend, the Hizballah networks 
had not received clear answers from its "Islamic fundamentalist" 
partners, who, despite their enthusiastic response to the idea, 
asked for some time to consult with their leaders and to do 
their own calculations, especially since they for a while have 
been under strict security surveillance in their own locations, 
restricting their movements. 
  However, Western security authorities well acquainted with 
the alliances of radical fundamentalist movements and 
international terrorist organizations of various orientations 
and nationalities do not rule out the involvement of a radical 
Palestinian group in the Hizballah revenge plan, since this plan 
is in line with this group's calculations and the international 
terrorist plan it has been preparing for months, after it 
redeployed its cells in Europe, specifically in Germany. 
  Will the alert and precautionary measures taken by the Mosad 
in Israeli embassies and the intensive exchange of information 
between most major Western intelligence services be successful? 
Or will Hizballah manage to avenge itself and prove to the 
world that its arm is long, just like Israel's?

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Terrorists Are Planning Revenge"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Combatants of the Islamic resistance movement 
Hizballah (party of Allah), in cooperation with top terrorists, 
are preparing attacks against Israeli targets abroad. In this 
context, they are also planning to operate on German soil. 
According to Arab intelligence services, a close collaborator 
of the legendary terrorist Carlos has left his hideout in Iran 
and arrived in Beirut to prepare some operations. In the 
Lebanese capital, the Carlos aide discussed with the chief 
coordinator for operations abroad of the Iranian Hizballah the 
setting up of terrorist cells that will also be active in the 
Federal Republic. The members of such cells will above all be 
recruited from the Islamistic movement in Tunisia. The ill-famed 
terrorist organization of Abu Nidal has channeled four 
combatants with forged travel documents from Beirut via Cyprus 
to Germany. The planned terrorist operations are intended as 
revenge for the kidnapping of Islamic activist Mustafa 
al-Dirani. [passage omitted on al-Dirani kidnapping]

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elias Maluleke] </F>
  [Excerpts] Neo-Nazi mercenaries from German -- some of them 
possibly posing as tourists -- are being brought into South 
Africa in large numbers to wage terrorism against the new 
government. Up to 2,500 hired killers could already be in the 
country. 
  A special investigation by City Press has found a terrifying 
web of conspiracy between the highly trained mercenaries and 
groups of rightwingers bent on toppling the ANC-led Government 
of National Unity. Police said they knew many German neo-Nazis 
were infiltrating the country -- and warned that they should 
expect no mercy from the law. 
  It has been found that the Nazis -- who enjoy close links 
with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] -- and other secret 
organisations -- have been armed with weapons of Russian origin 
and provided with military uniforms used by the SADF [South 
African Defense Force]. The mercenaries have also been linked 
to Third Force activities, the manufacturing of deadly weapons 
and gun running. 
  Security forces believe some of the Nazis enter the country 
illegally and are issued with false identification documents. 
South African and German authorities are, however, cooperating 
in trying to weed out the Nazi assassins. 
  Although the Department of Home Affairs and National 
Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who 
entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for 
February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It 
is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country 
in February. 
  During an interview, which was attended by a foreign 
television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain 
anonymous -- showed City Press a large quantity of rifle bullets 
he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted] 
  City Press also found that when Germans enter the country 
they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are 
given money and documents before they are dispatched to their 
underground cells. 
  The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for 
doing duty in South Africa. 
  A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the 
Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came 
from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia. 
  "There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the 
country with valid documents, even though they are not coming 
with good intentions. However, we are working closely with 
South African authorities to identify them," he said. 
  Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said 
police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to 
counter them had been launched. "They are planning to use South 
Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are 
watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored." Kotze 
said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as 
they were regarded as extremely dangerous.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elias Maluleke] </F>
  [Text] City Press can today reveal how a rightwing plot 
using German neo-Nazi mercenaries to assassinate President 
Nelson Mandela at his inauguration ceremony at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria was thwarted. A shoot-out between three 
heavily armed German nationals and police near Pretoria in March 
led to the dismantling of the plot to bring thousands of 
neo-Nazi mercenaries into South Africa to kill Mandela and turn 
the country into a bloodbath. 
  An estimated 2,500 of these mercenaries, who are paid 1,000 
German marks (about 2,200) a week, are still in South Africa. 
  The assassination was to have been carried out with mortar 
bombs fired from a hilltop near the Union Buildings and from the 
south side of the building from a hill near the University of 
South Africa while Mandela addressed the nation. Local 
rightwingers and the German neo-Nazis also planned to set off a 
powerful 500kg car bomb in the Pretoria city centre and another 
at Jan Smuts Airport on that day. 
  City Press was this week able to piece together the aborted 
plot -- which has been kept under wraps by the authorities. 
Police spokesman Captain Dave Harrington, however, confirmed 
that police knew of the planned assassination but said it could 
not be substantiated at the time. Harrington said police also 
had information that rightwingers "with bombs" had been spotted 
hiding in bushes on the hilltop near the Union Buildings on the 
day of the President's inauguration -- but a police search 
failed to find them. 
  The plot might very well have succeeded but for two things: 
  -- The revelation of heavily armed German nationals in South 
Africa after a shootout between two young police constables east 
of Pretoria and three men in a car led to the wounding of both 
constables, Juan van Schalkwyk and Danie Pretorius, and the 
death of one of the mercenaries. 
  -- Women aligned to rightwingers involved in the plot 
informed a SADF [South African Defense Force] Commando Unit, 
which passed the information on to Military Intelligence and the 
police. 
  The informants are also believed to have supplied the names 
of rightwingers who were allegedly involved in the bomb blasts 
that rocked the Reef shortly before the elections. It was this 
information that led to the joint police and military forces 
swoop on the bomb suspects, City Press was informed. 
  The three Germans involved in the shootout last March had 
been keeping a low profile in Tierpoort when the two young 
constables followed them. The three were travelling in a white 
Opel Record car -- later found to be registered in a dead man's 
name. They led the constables into a trap and opened fire on 
them with AK-47s. The policemen's lives were saved by 
bullet-proof vests but both were wounded, one seriously. 
  The body of the one of the Germans, Thomas Franz Kunst (32), 
was later found in the bush with nightsight binoculars, an AK-47 
with a silencer and 200 AK-47 rounds strapped to his body. Two 
hours later a second German, Stephan Rays (26), was arrested in 
the bush. Later a third suspect, Horst Klenz (57), was 
arrested. Klenz, also known as Heinrich Siems and Kluger, is 
wanted in Namibia in connection with the murders in 1989 of a 
policeman and a security guard -- who were killed in a bomb 
blast during the assisted escape of rightwingers Leonard 
Veenendal and Darryl Stopforth from a Namibian prison. 
  City Press learned that after the information was received 
from "women," police and military forces blockaded part of 
Donkerhoek in Pretoria East last month, arrested several members 
of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and other rightwing 
groups in connection with the bomb blasts and recovered an arms 
cache. 
  The police also raided a "safe house" used by German 
neo-Nazis where they found a large quantity of arms and 
explosives and documents relating to terror attacks. 
  Some of the would-be assassins are believed to have used the 
Donkerhoek premises of Radio Pretoria for meetings. The radio 
station interviewed two of the neo-Nazis and described them as 
"patriotic" foreigners who were risking their lives for the 
"volk" [Afrikaners].

said he hijacked the plane because he was dissatisfied with his 
low pay of only a few dozen yuan a month, and he received a 
compensation of only 8,000 yuan after his elder sister was 
killed by an unlicensed driver. 
  According to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, the plane, 
which was hijacked at 1920, gave the signal at 1924 that it had 
been hijacked. While our military and radar placed the plane 
under close surveillance, two F5-E fighter jets took off from 
the Chiayi Airport to intercept it. The fighters intercepted 
the plane at 1939 and guided it to a safe landing at the Chiang 
Kai-shek Airport at 1956. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Minister Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the Executive 
Yuan panel in charge of affairs about hijacking, indicated that 
the case will be handled according to the principle that the 
hijacker and the plane will be handled separately. He said the 
plane, after being routinely checked, will be allowed to fly to 
its original destination, but the hijacker will be turned over 
to judicial authorities for handling. He reiterated that while 
the government is firmly against any plane hijacking and will 
strictly punish any hijackers, relevant Chinese communist 
authorities should strengthen their security checks to forestall 
any hijacking attempts. He added that the hijacker will be 
repatriated after the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] has 
consultated the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan 
Straits [ARATS] and reached a common understanding with the 
latter. He said the hijacker will never be be allowed to stay 
in Taiwan. 
  As usual, the SEF has immediately notified ARATS on the 
procedures that will be taken for the repatriation of the 
hijacker. [passage omitted on previous hijacking incidents]

  [Excerpt] Zamboanga, Philippines, June 8 (AFP) -- Moslem 
gunmen massacred 15 hostages, including a Catholic priest, in a 
southern island Wednesday apparently to avenge an army assault 
against Islamic fundamentalists, the military said. 
  Maj. Gen. Orlando Soriano, chief of southern military 
forces, 
said the victims included Father Cirilo Nacorda, his driver, and 
13 male schoolteachers, who were part of a group kidnapped 
earlier Wednesday in Basilan island. 
  Their bullet-riddled bodies were fetched by a military truck 
from where they were slain and brought to funeral parlors in 
Basilan's capital Isabela, 850 kilometres (531 miles) south of 
Manila as night fell. 
  "This is a very inhuman act. They killed them like pigs," 
Soriano told AFP, saying the victims were hogtied before they 
were lined up and gunned down. 
  He said he had asked Basilan provincial governor Gerry 
Salapuddin "to do something about this" and help "get the 
perpetrators in a few days." 
  In Manila, President Fidel Ramos issued an order to military 
commanders to "launch an all-out offensive" against the killers. 
  But he also emphasized that the safe recovery of the 
remaining teachers still being held, was to "be considered 
paramount," a palace statement said. 
  The palace also said that "the civilian population should be 
safeguarded." 
  Soriano last week ordered an offensive against the Abu 
Sayyaf, an Islamic fundamentalist group blamed for a spate of 
anti-Christian bombings and ransom kidnappings, and originally 
based in Basilan. 
  At least 30 Abu Sayyaf men were killed in the assault on 
their stronghold in Jolo island southeast of Basilan. Their main 
camp fell to the military Monday in one of the military's 
biggest offensives this year. 
  Soriano said said the kidnapping and execution of the 
captives could be in retaliation for the Jolo attack since the 
abductors are believed to be allies of the Abu Sayyaf group. 
  It could also have been aimed to divert the army's attention 
from the Jolo offensive, he added. 
  Soriano said the Moslem gunmen flagged down a convoy of 
vehicles en route to Maluso town near Isabela early Wednesday 
and seized 59 persons. Thirty-seven were released and one 
escaped, leaving 21 in their hands. 
  The gunmen separated 15 male hostages, tied their hands, 
lined them up and opened fire. The fate of the six female 
hostages was not yet known. 
  Nacorda is parish priest of Matarling town in Basilan and a 
member of the Claretian religious order. 
  His predecessor, Spanish priest Father Bernardo Blanco, 
kidnapped for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf last year but escaped. 
  Soriano said two battalions of marines have been deployed to 
cordon off the massacre site, but said there will be no 
full-scale operation immediately because this might endanger the 
lives of the remaining hostages. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Another bombing incident took place in Mindanao,

(Kimball) Plaza in General Santos City. The explosion took 
place at around 1145 GMT. Those killed were identified as 
Catalina de la Pena, Adamalanta and Adelaida Natividad. 
Provincial Commander Romeo Pagalilawan said that there were

  [Text] A loud explosion rocked a guarded area in downtown 
Zamboanga City late last night wounding at least 20 people. A 
report quoted by the Philippines News Agency said the explosion 
occurred in front of the Lehan Ice Cream House at about 1335, 
the place -- a large area of Zamboanga City -- under total 
darkness. 
  Police said most of the victims of explosion have been 
rushed 
to the nearby Zamboanga City Medical Center for treatment of 
shrapnel wounds. Chief Superintendent Roberto Lastimoso, 
Philippine National Police Regional Command 9 commander, said 
the explosion could have been a spillover of the ongoing 
military operations against the Abu Sayyaf group in Patikul, 
Sulu. 
  Meantime, a morning daily in Manila quoted the Zamboanga 
police as saying that the car where the bomb was apparently 
hidden was a total wreck. 
  Land mines planted by Muslim guerrillas, by the Abu Sayyaf, 
had slowed down a government assault on the bandits' stronghold 
in Patikul, Sulu. The military said that none of the marines 
advancing towards the main rebel camp in Patikul have been hit 
by the land mines. 
  Maj. Gen. Orlando Soriano, Southern Command chief, said the 
rebels are determined to put out their last stand on Mount 
Patikul. He said that the rebels have ignored appeals by Muslim 
civilian officials to give up. 
  The fighting has so far claimed the lives of 35 rebels and 
seven government troops. General Soriano said the military will 
continue to pursue the Moro bandits, adding that the rebels have 
run out of ammunition. 
  The Abu Sayyaf group is being held responsible for the 
series 
of killings and kidnappings-for-ransom in Mindanao. The group 
has also opposed peace talks and a cease-fire between the 
government and the Moro National Liberation Front, which has 
kept a hands-off policy on the military offensive. 
  The military assault began early Friday morning with about 
3,000 troops backed by tanks, navy gunboats, and helicopter 
gunships launching land, sea, air raids to flush an estimated 
140 guerrillas from their mountain hideout. 
  There are still no word on Abu Sayyaf Chieftain Abdul Rajik 
Janjalani, against whom an order of capture -- dead or alive -- 
has been issued.

  [Text] The government has launched a massive man-hunt 
operation against the Abu Sayyaf group in connection with the 
bombing incident in Zamboanga City, which wounded 32 people. 
The Philippine National Police [PNP] ordered the manhunt 
following the severe explosion, which took place at around 8:30 
P.M. [Philippine time) along Urdaneta and Tomas Claudio Streets 
in Zamboanga City. PNP Director for Operation (Sagerico) 
Kagawan said that this was probably a tactic of the Abu Sayyaf 
group to divert the attention of the military and police from 
their continued operations in Sulu. 
  [Begin Kagawan recording] As of now, about 10 local leaders, 
both civilian and military, are negotiating with the Abu Sayyaf 
for them to come out and maybe surrender. And of course they 
will be accorded due process. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, military and police authorities have announced 
that they are ready to stop any operations against the Abu 
Sayyaf group. This was announced by Kagawan in spite of the 
ongoing operation staged by the combined forces of the police 
and the military. Based on the latest report, the military and 
police have already started besieging the island of Patikul, 
where 40 rebels have already been killed -- including one of the 
leaders of Abu Sayyaf, who was alleged to be responsible for the 
kidnappings in Mindanao -- while government troops suffered six 
casualties. Kagawan said that the rebels still have the 
opportunity to surrender and enjoy their rights of due process. 
  [Begin Kagawan recording] It is very logical; it's part of 
their strategy. They usually do such things to ease the 
pressure there in Patikul. They have to create a diversion, 
giving an impression that they also have a sizable force in 
Zamboanga so that maybe some of the forces that are utilized 
there in Patikul will have to be withdrawn and run after the 
perpetrators there in Zamboanga. It's like you dissipate the 
forces so that maybe the pressure on you will decrease. [end 
recording]

  [Text] The Abu Sayyaf extremist group has claimed 
responsibility for the Sunday bombing at the commercial center 
in Zamboanga City in southern Philippines. Xeroxed letters 
reportedly from a certain Abu Jihad were delivered by an 
unidentified youth yesterday afternoon. 
  Thirty-six people were wounded in the bomb blast. The 
explosive was believed planted inside or beneath a car parked 
beside Shopper Central. The car was a total wreck. The 
explosion was so powerful, it was heard by residents within a 
five kilometer radius.

  [Text] Six bystanders were injured when a bomb exploded in 
the middle of a city fair in Muang district early yesterday. 
  Two of the victims required hospital treatment for serious 
injuries. 
  The police said they suspected that a bomb was thrown into a 
crowd watching a MANORA traditional southern soap opera around 
1.40 a.m. 
  The blast left a hole about three inches deep and 13 inches 
in diameter in front of the stage. 
  About 300 people were watching the soap opera when the bomb 
went off. 
  The blast sent spectators fleeing, the police said. 
  One of those injured allegedly told the police he overheard 
a 
group of teenagers whispering that a bomb would explode and that 
they should leave quickly. 
  Governor Banyat Chanthasena, who visited the injured in 
hospital, told reporters that the blast was intended to disrupt 
the city's festival. 
  He said he had earlier told the police to step up security 
checks on Saturday night, the last day of the event. 
  But thorough checks were not possible because more than 
20,000 people attended. 
  By late last night, no separatist group had claimed 
responsibility for the blast. 
  Col. Phongsak Ekbarinasing, deputy commander of Task Force 
43, said he believed the incident was not perpetrated by 
separatists but by some trouble-makers.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian guerrilla activities monitored through 8 
June. 
  An attack perpetrated on the morning of 2 June by 30 members 
of the Army of National Liberation (ELN) against the police 
station and the mayor's office in Villa del Rosario, 10 km 
southeast of Cucuta, left three police officers dead and four 
others wounded. Property damage resulting from the attack has 
been estimated at more than 80 million pesos. Meanwhile, three 
trucks that were deployed to defend Villa del Rosario were 
ambushed by another group of guerrillas on the Cucuta-San 
Antonio road. Police also defused two bombs outside the mayor's 
office. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 13A) 
  Four guerrillas, members of the ELN's Camilo Torres Front, 
have been killed in clashes with the San Mateo Battalion in La 
Gloria and Pelaya, Cesar Department. Meanwhile, lawyer Roger 
Efrain Lorduy was released by rebels who had kidnapped him. One 
FAL rifle, two R-15 rifles, a fragmentation grenade, and other 
weapons were seized. Meanwhile, on 2 June, a 
Cincelejo-Barranquilla bus was torched by 15 members of the 37th 
Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 
Ovejas, Sucre Department. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in 
Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 10A) 
  The 4th Brigade has reported that four military agents 
killed 
in a FARC ambush in Altos de la Cienega, Antioquia Department, 
will be buried today in Medellin. General Mario Hugo Galan said 
the attack took place as the military agents were implementing 
the Democracy Plan to guarantee the 19 June elections. One 
soldier was wounded during the ambush. (Santa Fe de Bogota

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Jun (AFP) -- A dynamite bomb 
of moderate force killed two people when it exploded. The two 
people were carrying the bomb this Sunday in downtown Arauca, 
capital of the eastern department bearing the same name, located 
near the border with Venezuela, 350 km east of Santa Fe de 
Bogota, the police have informed. 
  The victims, Elizabeth Medina and William Montilla, were 
riding a motorcycle in downtown Arauca when the bomb went off. 
  The Arauca police are investigating the incident and said 
the 
guerrillas are to blame for the bloody incident, considering the 
upcoming 19 June presidential elections, in which the successor 
of President Cesar Gaviria for the 1994-1998 period will be 
chosen.

  [Text] Quito, 9 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Joint police and Army 
operations to locate two U.S. oil technicians who were abducted 
in Ecuador's Amazon region has yielded no results yet, it was 
reported here. Intense land and air searches were conducted 
over a broad area of eastern Sucumbios Province, along the 
border with Colombia. 
  U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero confirmed on Tuesday the 
disappearance of his countrymen Elliot Neil Norton and Karl 
Nolan. The U.S. citizens, employees of the Intradil Green 
drilling company, had been missing since last weekend when they 
were seen in the oil town of Shushufind. 
  Press reports in Quito indicated that as a result of the 
investigations conducted in Sucumbios in the past few hours the 
police had arrested several suspects, apparently Colombians and 
Ecuadoreans. 
  According to sources close to the police, the oil 
technicians 
were presumably taken by their captors to the Colombian side of 
the border, which would further hamper the rescue. Commander 
Ruben Barahona told newsmen that different organized crime 
groups operate in this conflict-ridden area of Ecuador's Amazon 
region. Barahona added that in that area drug traffickers, 
among their other activities, are responsible for the transfer 
of precursor chemicals that are used in Colombia to process the 
drug. "Criminal and drug activities have made the place very 
dangerous," the official indicated. 
  Despite intense operations by the Armed Forces and the 
police, whose collaboration was requested by the diplomatic 
mission, authorities conceded today that they do not have any 
concrete leads to find the missing persons. 
  At least five U.S. citizens, including two technicians of 
U.S. oil companies in Sucumbios, were kidnapped in past years. 
In most cases, the kidnapees were rescued, but no specifics 
exist on the conditions or the ransom agreed upon for their 
release. 
  Administration Secretary General Carlos Larreategui denied 
that the recent wave of kidnappings registered in various 
locations of the country is related to a subversive group. 
Larreategui blamed the kidnappings on common crime and stressed 
that the only armed group known in Ecuador, referring to the 
"Red Sun," announced its demobilization and turned its weapons 
in to military authorities. 
  However, presumed "Red Sun" militants who broke away from 
those who negotiated the peace have told the media from hiding 
that they will continue their activities and the armed struggle.

  [Text] Quito, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ecuadoran "Red Sun" 
armed movement announced today that it reached a "peace 
agreement" with the Ecuadoran Government, which will permit it 
to surrender its weapons and quit subversive activities. 
  Ramiro Celi Garces, foremost leader of the subversive group, 
admitted at the National Defense Ministry the movement's 
"military defeat" and announced it will join the peaceful 
democratic struggle. He recognized the mistake of acting with 
weapons when violence is not favorable "at this historic moment" 
and he denied the group had engaged in terrorism or kidnappings. 
  Celi Garces said the struggle of the "Red Sun" was directed 
at ending the injustices of "a totally atomized society" and the 
misfortunes of people subject to an unconscientious government. 
  Our organization "has deemed it necessary to stop using 
weapons as an alternative" and "to proclaim our will to secure a 
peace agreement," he stated. 
  The proposal by the Red Sun and Inti Puka [red sun in 
Quechua] is based on commitments that establish eliminating the 
organization, quitting clandestine activities, surrendering 
weapons to the Army, and rejoining the country's democratic 
activities. 
  In exchange the group asks the government "as a 
demonstration 
of its will to achieve peace to redefine its social and economic 
policies in order to improve the living conditions of the 
people." 
  Inti Puka also requests the government to release of one of 
its leaders and the to end all police and military control of 
the demobilized militants of the "Red Sun Communist Party," as 
Celi Garces calls it. 
  Defense Minister Jose Gallardo expressed his satisfaction 
with the decision of the group, which has been linked to the 
Peruvian Shining Path because of its actions and slogans, 
although no connection has ever been proven. 
  Gallardo said the Red Sun's decision to adopt the path of 
peace represents a victory for peace-loving Ecuadorans. 
  The group had been active in Ecuador for three years and had 
been blamed for several dynamite attacks against public offices 
which only caused material damages, including damage to an 
electricity tower of the Papallactal potable water plant last 
May. 
  Leaders Celi Garces and Patricio Alban Sanchez, representing 
the demobilized members whose number is not known, surrendered 
their weapons to Gallardo at the Defense Ministry. 
Sophisticated weapons were exhibited at a sumptuous ceremony. 
  The ceremony was attended by the military high command, 
members of the cabinet, representatives of human rights, and 
relatives of those laying down their weapons. 
  Political analysts noted that the surrender of weapons has 
been the result of intense investigations and Armed Forces 
surveillance of the movement's activities. 
  A 19-year-old student, who was captured in August 1993 for 
being a member of the Red Sun, denied that the group has any 
connection with any Ecuadoran political party, as local media 
have reported. 
  The last subversive group recognized in Ecuador was the 
so-called "Alfaro Lives, Dammit" which in 1990 dissolved itself 
upon signing a peace accord with the Social Democratic 
government of Rodrigo Borja (1988-92).

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It was reported this afternoon that a clandestine 
group -- the self-proclaimed Domingo Monterrosa Command -- has 
issued a death threat against Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos 
Mauricio Molina. Molina, however, denied that he himself 
received the death threat, but he did not rule out the 
possibility that such a threat had indeed been made. According 
to news agencies reports, Molina was given 48 hours to leave the 
country, or he will be executed. 
  [Begin Molina recording] I cannot rule out the possibility 
that the threat, which was uttered by people who oppose peace 
and the country's stability, might be serious. [end recording] 
  Molina added that despite the threat, he is willing to 
remain 
in his post, because he has made a pledge to the people and 
intends to fulfill it. He also said he will open an 
investigation to identify the individuals behind the threats -- 
individuals he said should be considered enemies of peace. 
  [Begin Molina recording] The threats against several Jesuits 
do not contribute to the peace process whatsoever. Instead, 
each voice that calls for violence undermines the present trend 
toward peace. [end recording] 
  A communique signed by the Domingo Monterrosa Command and 
reported by various news agencies also contains death against 
the attorney general, the president of the Judiciary Council, 
Jesuit priests, and Luis Gomez Zarate for his criticism of the 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

  [Text] Deputy Carmen Calderon de Escalon (the president's 
sister) has received a death threat. Gloria Salguero Gross, the 
president of the National Legislative Assembly, reported this 
yesterday. 
  The official said that the deputy, who lives in Santa Ana, 
received the threat on Wednesday in an anonymous telephone call, 
taken at the headquarters of the Nationalist Republican Alliance 
(ARENA) in that western city. They said they "were going to 
kill her along the Santa Ana-San Salvador highway." Miss 
Salguero credited the threats to "sick minds." Deputy Calderon 
de Escalon, sister of President Armando Calderon Sol, is 
currently the secretary on the Assembly Board of Directors and 
an ARENA leader. She also chairs the Assembly Treasury 
Committee and a Special Budget Commission. 
  A commission, which was appointed by the Assembly Board of 
Directors, is studying security for the legislative building and 
its deputies. There are 84 deputies in all and to provide 
security for all of them would require a special budget 
appropriation. 
  Salguero Gross, during the first press conference she has 
given as assembly president, also reported that President 
Calderon Sol will appear at today's plenary session to formally 
present his first request for permission to leave the country. 
Unofficial sources said the president will travel to Costa Rica 
and Puerto Rico. The assembly president indicated that he will 
be given a special one- year permit to travel anywhere in Latin 
America. 
  Meanwhile, the official announced that members of the media 
will be required to carry a special "card" to gain access to the 
assembly installations. In her opinion, this is organization. 
For others it is limiting the freedom of press. 
  In addressing the "self-investigation" the deputies are 
supposed to complete on themselves on the excessive cost of the 
remodeling and repair work done at the legislative buildings, 
Salguero Gross reported that an external audit will determine 
whether there was mismanagement or not. Deputies of the new 
Technical Committee (charged with overseeing the construction 
work at the building) agreed to request an independent audit to 
determine if the construction of wooden dividers really costs 
4.2 million colones. A member of this committee reported 
yesterday that prior to this, the committee will investigate the 
name and background of the contractors involved in the project, 
including the air conditioning supplier. 
  [San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish on 9 June carries a 
375- word report on page 24, with reactions by the UN Observers 
for El Salvador, ONUSAL. ONUSAL Chief Enrique Ter Horst said 
that "the threats should not be taken more seriously than what 
they really are." He explains that "they are anonymous so 
anyone can make them." "We have no way of knowing," Ter Horst 
continued, "whether the threats were made by death squads or by 
some impulsive individual wanting to have some fun creating 
instability." Diego Garcia Sayan, chief of the ONUSAL Human 
Rights Division, said that the special ONUSAL investigation 
group will look into the incidents.]

Corado Figueroa by reporter Balmore Parada on 9 June; place not

Parada introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado 
Figueroa today condemned death threats that have been made 
against Salvadoran officials and well-known personalities. Gen. 
Corado offered the Army's cooperation in this regard, although 
this institution is not responsible for public security. The 
self-styled Domingo Monterrosa Command this week issued an 
anonymous message making death threats against several 
officials, including Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio 
Molina Fonseca. Nationalist Republican Alliance Deputy Carmen 
Calderon de Escalon also received a death threat on the phone. 
Corado said that these actions will have to be neutralized so 
that these threats do not materialize. 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] Parada Is the 
Army willing to help investigate [words indistinct]? 
  Corado: Yes. We have always said that, although 
public security is not our main responsibility, we are always in 
touch with the Public Security Ministry and, previously, with 
the National Police and National Civilian Police to use our 
resources to begin joint action with them designed to counter 
these threats. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (AFP) -- Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
center-left presidential candidate, has received an anonymous 
death threat in Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, where he is on a 
campaign tour, the official NOTIMEX news agency reported on 
Saturday. 
  The anonymous threat against Cardenas stated: "We are ready 
to eradicate social blights. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is one of 
them. Remember what happened to Colosio. Say good-bye to your 
candidate, this week he dies." 
  Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), was assassinated on 23 March and 
although the perpetrator was arrested, the motive has yet to be 
clarified. 
  The source indicated that the anonymous threat, which was 
received by the Oaxaca state committee of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD, center-left), was sent by an 
organization called Lady of Guadalupe Archdiocesan Sanctuary. 
  In an event in the community of Macuiltianguis, Oaxaca, 
Cardenas scoffed at the threat, indicating that "their bark is 
worse than their bite." He added, "when someone wants to do 
something, he does not announce it. There is nothing to worry 
about."

the National Government must increase the number of Border 
Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to 
conduct their work. 
  The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the

Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should 
disappear and that members of the National Police should be 
properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively.

  [Excerpt] The recent arrest of several Shining Path [SL] 
leaders has alerted the antiterrorist forces to a new and 
powerful organization within the unruly Red Path [Sendero Rojo] 
faction of the SL organization which has for some time planned 
and directed subversive actions in Lima. 
  The new SL organ, called Lima-Regional Committee [Comite 
Lima- Regional] has become the strongest political-military SL 
sector in Lima. The Lima-Regional Committee is the result of 
the merging of the Peoples' Aid [Socorro Popular] and the 
Metropolitan Committee, both of which are SL groups that 
operated in Lima. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has 
announced that the new group is responsible for numerous cases 
of murder and terrorist actions in Lima these past few months. 
  Among them are the recent attacks against City Hall, the Air 
Force headquarters, and the U.S. Embassy as well as the murder 
of neighborhood leaders and members of the Peruvian National 
Police. 
  Dincote believes the new committee is one of the most 
powerful the SL has throughout the country, although it is 
unaware of its real operating capacity. 
  The police know the group is headed by a collegiate 
leadership. SL members arrested by Dincote have said the Lima 
Regional leadership comprises: Jenny Rodriguez Neyra, aka Rita; 
Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, aka Luis; Maritza Infante Yupanqui, 
aka Milagros; Abdon Cruzat Cardenas; and two other unidentified 
terrorists. 
  The first information about the group was disclosed by a SL 
member arrested by Dincote in May 1993. Until then the police 
were unaware of the Lima-Regional Committee's existence. 
  A SL member identified as Guillermo Pflucker Ruiz, whose 
alias is Raul according to his police records, said the Peoples' 
Aid and the Lima Metropolitan Committee united their weakened 
force following the arrest of Abimael Guzman and several other 
SL leaders. 
  It seems the harsh blows sustained by the SL's military and 
political structure forced the merger because the two sectors 
had been seriously affected by the police action. 
  By late 1992, the Peoples' Aid and the Lima Metropolitan 
Committee had lost their main leaders and their operation 
capacity had been seriously affected. 
  With the merge the SL has maintained, although at a 
significantly lower level, its capacity and presence in Lima 
through its criminal actions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Lima, 8 Jun (EFE) -- A police source confirmed today 
that the Peruvian Police thwarted a large-scale terrorist attack 
through the arrest of a woman believed to be the main Shining 
Path [SL] military chief in Lima. 
  Police sources reported that terrorists planned to detonate 
a 
car bomb containing 600 kg of explosives in Lima on 17 May on 
the 14th anniversary of the launching of the SL "people's war." 
  The attack was aborted when extremist Ayma Rosa Cabanillas 
Contreras, 22 years old, was arrested. She confessed that she 
was chosen to conduct the subversive operation and to provide 
the necessary materials to those entrusted with perpetrating the 
attack. 
  Cabanillas Contreras has four police records for involvement 
in terrorist attacks. The police source said she was arrested 
on 10 May "after an exhaustive intelligence operation that 
started about four months ago." 
  Cabanillas has been placed at the disposal of the military 
courts on charges of "treason against the fatherland," the legal 
term in Peru for aggravated terrorist crimes. If found guilty, 
she could be sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Cabanillas is the second SL leader to be arrested by the 
Peruvian Police in the past two months. The police already 
arrested Felipe Tenorio, believed to be the SL "Number Two." 
  The SL organization split in 1993 after its top-ranking 
leader, Abimael Guzman -- who was arrested in 1992 -- recognized 
the political and military defeat of the SL and submitted a 
peace proposal to the government.

  [Excerpt] National Police from the 9th Subregion have 
arrested Comrade Maria, who was in charge of organizing the 
Shining Path local committee in Ayacucho. Police said Comrade 
Maria and two others terrorists will be presented to the media 
in the next few days. 
  Police said these captures allowed the deactivation of 
future 
actions against local officials. This is why police distributed 
special instructions for personal security and invited officials 
to carry out target practice with short- and long-range weapons.

  [Text] Lima, 6 Jun (EFE) -- The Lima daily EXPRESO reported 
on 6 June that the police have thwarted an attempt by the Maoist 
Shining Path [SL] gang to kill former Peruvian President 
Fernando Belaunde Terry (1980-1985). 
  EXPRESO reported that a man known as "Comrade Jonas" was 
arrested some 100 meters from the podium from which Belaunde 
Terry was addressing a rally at the main square in Huaraz, 
capital of Ancash Department in the northern Andean region. The 
arrested man was carrying a long-range weapon fitted with a 
silencer. 
  "Comrade Jonas" allegedly confessed that his mission was to 
"eliminate" the leaders of Popular Action, the party that 
Belaunde Terry founded and leads. 
  The police reported that three other SL members were 
arrested 
in Yungay, also in Ancash Department. 
  According to EXPRESO "Comrade Jonas" was involved in the 
murder of two Polish priests in May 1993 in Pariacoto, Ancash 
Department.

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] A new Shining Path [SL] slogan is starting to appear 
on poor neighborhoods' walls: "An imprisoned Maoist is a dead 
Maoist." 
  This is the war cry of subversives who are against the "new 
and great definition" imparted from prison by Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso: "To struggle for the achievement of a Peace Accord." 
  This is a clash between the "Leftist Annihilation Line 
(LLI)" 
headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, who is supported by the "cadres" 
(highly trained militants) who are not in prison, and the 
"Right-Wing Opportunist Line" (LOD), headed by Guzman, who is 
supported by the majority of SL members in prison. 
  LOD members were the first to propose an end to the armed 
struggle in view of the severe blows sustained by the party 
leadership and of the need to end the bloodbath. 
  Guzman has decided to hold a second SL congress so the "new 
and great decision" will be adopted by all combatants to thus 
recover party authority and avoid internal party divisions. 
  Ramirez Durand, however, has not remained idle. 
  In February, LLI members were able to get the SL Central 
Committee to hold a meeting in Ayacucho. They were not only 
able to restructure the main party leadership organization with 
acting members elected during the first congress in 1988 but 
also ousted Guzman and all of his close advisers from the 
organization by adopting the following agreements: 
  A) Neither the war nor the party can be led from prison 
because combatants behind bars are inoperative and disconnected 
from reality. This is the reason for adopting the slogan: "An 
imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist." 
  B) Those who favor a peace agreement are violating basic 
Marxists-Leninist-Maoist principles, particularly the "Gonzalo 
Thought" principles, and, therefore, isolating themselves and, 
by their own initiative, deserting the party. 
  They also reasserted an agreement already approved during 
two 
other previous high-ranking meetings (Central Committee "working 
sessions" of a "resolutory nature" in December 1992 and August 
1993) that obviously were not attended by Guzman: to continue 
"the people's war." 
  Public attention is again centered on those SL members out 
of 
prison headed by Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," because of 
recent terrorist actions (car bombs, an "armed stoppage," an 
attack on a section of the oil pipeline, and armed propaganda). 
  Since the disclosure of Guzman's letters to President 
Alberto 
Fujimori and details on the peace agreement negotiations, the 
government has only disclosed details on the movements of 
Guzman's faction and its leaders but has concealed the reactions 
of Maoists out of prison regarding the conduct of their 
"leadership and authority." 
  It is now known that LLI members, also known by their LOD 
enemies as "traitors" and "military goons," did not resign 
themselves to accepting Guzman's capitulation. They allege that 
the videos are a sham, the letters false, and the agreement a 
hoax with the ultimate objective of assassinating "President 
Gonzalo" and destroying the armed struggle. With this excuse, 
they proceeded to restructure the entire party apparatus. They 
have filled vacant posts left by their leaders and dead or 
imprisoned "cadres" and resumed the implementation of plans 
approved by Guzman at the Third Central Committee Plenum meeting 
in August 1992, just a few weeks before his arrest. 
  That is why the government strategy of strengthening the 
leadership of Guzman and the arrested Central Committee members 
and presenting them as the real SL representatives (recent 
intelligence reports recommend breaking the isolation of Guzman 
and his aides, allowing them to visit other inmates or vice 
versa to allow them to intensify their propaganda campaign to 
promote a split in the SL organization) will have to be 
reconsidered given that the organization has begun to be 
represented by the LLI. 
  To begin with, the government must resume the talks, which 
have been paralyzed for the past seven months according to LOD 
leaflets. Guzman needs new arguments to attract a new public -- 
the "glorious combat trenches" and the inoperative militants 
currently have very little or no influence on the course of the 
war -- because the same speech for imprisoned SL members and 
those who are operational outside has not yielded results. 
  Statements like "a golden page was turned with the people's 
war; we are now beginning a stage of bloodless war that means 
politics without bloodshed; a bloody war is politics with 
bloodshed," can affect a SL member burdened by the humiliating 
prospect of being able to enjoy sunlight for only 30 minutes a 
day for the rest of his life. Such statements do not have the 
same effect on a "military commander" who, for example, conducts 
a column and has seen his subordinates fall precisely in the 
name of the "people's war" that, according to Guzman's new 
position, does not mean "giving up or abandoning the revolution 
but to continue fighting our new conditions." They also will 
have no effect on an Upper Huallaga column that lives from the 
"protection money" it charges drug traffickers. 
  The deadlock of the talks between the government 
representatives and the imprisoned SL spokesmen can be explained 
by the conditions demanded by the SL, which have annoyed 
President Fujimori, who said the only result he expects from the 
agreement is "unconditional surrender." 
  LA REPUBLICA had access to the documents the SL members 
circulate inside the prisons, which contain 15 points divided 
into four sections as an "introduction" and 11 other points 
listed as "basic proposals." 
  These "guidelines for basic documents," that is, the 
Maoists' 
expectations of the benefits they expect to obtain after laying 
down their weapons, do not correspond at all to an 
"unconditional surrender." 
  By granting the following concessions: "To cease the 
people's war that began on 17 May 1980 in its four wartime 
expressions of guerrilla actions (selective annihilation, 
sabotage, political agitation, and armed propaganda and 
guerrilla warfare), to self dissolve the People's Guerrilla 
Army, to destroy their weapons and combat means, and also to 
dissolve the Popular and Grass-Roots Committees that support the 
RPND [Republica Popular de Nueva Democracia -- New Democracy 
People's Republic]," Guzman intends to obtain: 
  A) the end of anti-subversive operations by security forces. 
  B) the release of all the men and women accused or sentenced 
for terrorist actions and the improvement of the prison 
conditions as long as the release process lasts. 
  C) Ending all trials for terrorist crimes; the opening of 
new court proceedings; and the nullification of all subpoenas 
and arrest warrants submitted against combatants, collaborators, 
and sympathizers both in Peru and abroad. 
  D) Ending the government campaign "conducted in the country 
and abroad against the people's war, the party, and its members 
and sympathizers." 
  E) Reinstating the legal status of SL members, including 
those living abroad. 
  F) Returning the SL "museum" seized from Abimael Guzman in 
1990, including the video in which he is seen dancing a Greek 
dance and the books from his personal library. 
  G) Allowing an "honorable" burial for Augusta La Torre 
Carrasco, "Comrade Norah," whose body currently is buried in a 
secret tomb. 
  H) Promulgating a general amnesty law "that will reconcile 
the nation, without victors or vanquished, without reprisals or 
shame." 
  Pardoning all SL members, releasing them from jail, and 
letting them go free is not exactly what the government had in 
mind with Guzman's surrender, particularly because he does not 
believe this agreement is tantamount to a defeat or a surrender 
but "a period between an end of a stage in the International 
Proletariat Revolution and the future Great Wave itself. This 
justifies the general political withdrawal. We have started to 
manage the general military withdrawal as a result of the 
general political withdrawal, which is complex and difficult but 
necessary to develop other forms of struggle under new 
conditions." 
  Guzman and his followers simply believe that the people's 
war 
will continue but under different forms of struggle. These new 
forms of struggle will establish the conditions for the advent 
of that "future Great Wave." 
  At the other extreme there are Ramirez Durand and his 
people, 
who reasserted their leadership at the February Central 
Committee meeting, during which they achieved several agreements 
to guarantee the armed struggle's continuation. Some of them 
are: "To struggle to impose Maoism as the new, third, and 
superior stage of Marxism; to tenaciously combat imperialism, 
revisionism, and international reactionary movements; to 
reassert the principle of revolutionary violence as the 
universal law achieved during the people's war; to work among 
the masses in and for the people's war; to struggle to vindicate 
power; to incorporate the masses in the people's war; (and to 
organize) the arming of the masses." 
  The 14 years of armed struggle, therefore, are taking by 
surprise an organization whose combatants out of prison have 
started the reorganization of their party leadership and 
continues to implement a guerrilla campaign interrupted in view 
of the arrests that were made and that has isolated their 
"prisoners of war" (including Guzman and its Central Committee). 
They are considered nonoperational cadres unable to lead the 
party and the war. In view of this, the SL radical group has 
been able to describe the peace agreement as a desperate 
proposal made by combatants who find themselves pressured by the 
prospects of life imprisonment or, in the best of cases, who 
will be in jail for at least many decades. 
  Everything indicates that the government will continue to 
strengthen Guzman's authority and undermine Ramirez Durand's and 
his real power over the combatants out of prison. Under these 
circumstances, "Feliciano" will increase the levels of violence 
to obtain more attention and recover the war initiative. From 
now on, should antiterrorist forces ask whether or not they 
support the peace agreement when they arrest SL members? If 
they say they support it, should they let them go free? This is 
one of the several contradictions of the new course of the war. 
Before, a jailed Maoist was a key figure in the armed struggle, 
a fortunate member of a "luminous combat trench." Nowadays, to 
be jailed is tantamount to being buried alive. A jailed Maoist 
is the same as a dead Maoist. The dead have little or no 
influence on the war's course.

  [Text] Damascus, 4 Jun (SANA)--Iranian Foreign Minister 
Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati and his delegation today left Damascus 
following a two-day visit to Syria. 
  He was seen off at Damascus International Airport by Foreign 
Minister Faruq al-Shar', senior Foreign Ministry staff, the 
Iranian ambassador in Damascus, and the embassy staff. 
  Dr. Velayati made a statement to a SANA correspondent in 
which he said: My visit to Damascus was very positive and 
cordial. I had the honor to meet President Hafiz al-Asad and 
convey to him a message from Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. Discussion during the meeting 
also revolved around bilateral ties, the situation in the 
region, the recent Nonaligned Movement meeting in Cairo, and the 
developments that occurred within the Nonaligned Movement and 
its very positive attitude toward the Lebanese and Bosnian 
issues. 
  Dr. Velayati noted that the discussion also revolved around 
the savage Israeli aggression against Lebanon and the Lebanese 
citizens. He said: We stressed Syria's and Iran's support for 
Lebanon -- government and people -- and for its steadfastness in 
the face of these aggressions.

<F P=106> [Article by Alex Fishman] </F>
  [Text] Mustafa al-Dirani's interrogators are unlikely to 
spend the next few weeks sorting papers. Their main problem 
will probably be to sort through the fantasies and the lies the 
man has been so ably fabricating and to try to find a genuine 
clue. Extracting the truth from an interrogatee is an almost 
scientific project nowadays, but with professionals like 
al-Dirani, polygraph wires often go up in smoke. 
  When senior security sources defined al-Dirani this week as 
"a hard nut to crack" or as "a mature, stable personality, a man 
with experience in interrogation and who cannot be manipulated," 
they did not intend to imply that the man was groaning under the 
pressure of interrogation but keeping his silence nevertheless. 
Al-Dirani, who saw his life pass before his eyes more than once 
in his 46 years, is not exactly what one would call a model of 
health. He has used a cane since his serious injury in the 
early 1980's, which, by the way, guaranteed that he would be 
unable to flee his captors by adeptly climbing up the balcony or 
disappearing through another getaway in the Qasr Naba house in 
which he was sleeping. 
  It can be assumed that with his medical record, he has no 
intention of getting to the stage of facing moderate physical 
pressure. His type generally adopts the "negative cooperation" 
technique -- namely, to swamp his interrogators with answers 
that will force them to work very hard to verify them. 
  Al-Dirani's known biography indicates that in the late 
1980's, he was interrogated at a Syrian interrogation facility 
for several months. In those days, when Amal, from which he had 
been ousted, and Hizballah were waging a savage war, the Syrians 
were interested in neutralizing him. His Israeli interrogators 
are hardly likely to be able to surprise a man who served his 
apprenticeship -- at some level or another -- in a Syrian 
interrogation facility. 
  The first intimation of al-Dirani's fertile cooperation with 
his interrogators was given by the Intelligence Branch chief a 
few hours after al-Dirani was brought to Israel. Speaking at a 
news conference, Major General Uri Sagi said that Israel had 
verified some preliminary information about the navigator's 
whereabouts throughout the period he was held by the head of the 
Believers Resistance organization, Mustafa al-Dirani. 
  The most efficient interrogation usually takes place during 
the first hours, when the subject is still in shock. It can be 
safely presumed that al-Dirani -- still groggy with sleep, 
finding himself in a strange, hostile, menacing environment 
merely hours after the 'Id al-Adha meal consumed in cozy family 
surroundings -- talked. The interrogators' problem was to 
maintain this momentum until the abducted man found his bearings 
and organized his thoughts. Apparently, al-Dirani recovered 
rapidly. 
  The interrogators, who are engaged in a war of minds with 
their subject, "suffer" from excessive information about the 
man. After he got hold of Ron Arad, in the two years in which 
he held him, and after that, al-Dirani was a prime intelligence 
target, and each detail about his actions was meticulously filed 
away. For years, information about POW's and MIA's, along with 
warnings concerning war plans, has been a permanent feature in 
the alert chapter of the daily circular which the Intelligence 
Corps distributes among its men. Therefore, al-Dirani's 
interrogation could be a rerun of the "This Is Your Life" 
program. 
  Israel was able to study al-Dirani's colorful life story -- 
the story of a moderate Amal member who mutated into a radical 
Islamic terrorist -- almost firsthand when his nephew from Sidon 
miraculously popped up inside the Green Line in 1988. Since 
that time, by the way, junior has been able to develop very 
nicely in Israel, according to foreign reports. 
  The technique of bringing in relatives to exert pressure on 
an interrogatee is controversial. In Ahmad Jibril's case, the 
abduction of a relative mellowed him and enabled the recovery of 
Nahal Brigade soldiers who had been kidnapped during the Lebanon 
war. In the case of al-Dirani, however, his clan was 
unimpressed by their nephew's sudden disappearance. 
  On 15 December 1988, in the framework of the effort to 
uncover information on the POW's and MIA's -- mainly Ron Arad 
and servicemen Fink and Alsheikh -- the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] brought in four al-Dirani organization activists, 
including Jawad Kasafi, from the village of Tibnin. According 
to material amassed at Tel Aviv University's Unit for the 
Research of Political Violence, the kidnapping was designed to 
put pressure on the organization and to use the kidnapped men as 
bargaining chips in an exchange deal. At that time, Israel was 
not certain whether al- Dirani was still holding Arad. Only in 
1989 did Israel learn that al-Dirani had handed Arad over to 
people close to him, members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards 
in al-Biqa', either for temporary safekeeping or for a payment. 
Kasafi, a senior Believers Resistance activist, was included in 
an Israeli proposal for an exchange deal submitted on 31 July 
1989. Since the proposal was rejected, we can assume the man is 
still living at the Israeli taxpayer's expense. 
  Qasr Naba, a small, obscure Lebanese village, lies at the 
feet of a mountain ridge as tall as Mount Hermon. Nights are 
cold there, even in the summer. In addition to the hostile 
forces deployed in the area, the approach to the village entails 
quite formidable technical difficulties, such as flight in thin 
atmosphere, which requires expert pilots. When the Ministerial 
Committee on National Security Affairs approved the abduction 
operation on Thursday, the target was ripe. The graphic 
descriptions of the kidnapping published in the Lebanese press 
-- similar to descriptions of other operations attributed to 
Israel, such as the killing of Abu-Jihad [Khalil al-Wazir] -- 
were only close to the reality that developed on the ground. 
  According to foreign reports, since 1987 the complacent 
victim had been spending his time in Beirut, from where he ran 
his organization, which was scattered over four permanent 
locations. He used to spend 'Id al-Adha in the village of Qasr 
Naba, far away from Beirut. 
  His abduction was planned six months ago and was to be 
carried out four months ago, but was aborted. Thus the IDF 
troops -- the General Staff's elite commando unit, according to 
AFP, with a high concentration of officers, according to the 
chief of staff -- were well acquainted with the game plan. They 
merely had to await the government's go-ahead. 
  On Friday, at about 0900 in the morning, Rabin gave the 
final 
approval from his home. The troops stealthily made their way to 
the cottage on the outskirts of the village. According to the 
testimony of family members, the operation lasted only a few 
minutes. It can be assumed, therefore, that the attack forces 
were well acquainted with the plan of the house. Al-Dirani 
himself did not get a chance to reach out for the gun he always 
keeps at hand. Al-Dirani's brother, who must have been awakened 
by the racket made by the family members roused by the break-in 
and by the sound of the soldiers running about, fired a gun on 
the other side of the wall. 
  The secret of the operation's success lay in the surprise 
and 
the speed, which required precise, up-to-date information about 
every inch of the house. The information had been painstakingly 
collected bit by bit by various teams over a long period. To 
compile a "dossier" that could satisfy the Intelligence Branch 
chief and the operational unit commander and help them decide 
that the troops would be running a reasonable calculated risk, a 
lot of lackluster work was invested -- the kind of work that 
never makes the headlines. 
  When the soldiers and their catch passed the staircase 
separating the two parts of the cottage, gunfire coming 
apparently from the brother's entrance door was directed at 
them. One officer was injured in the thigh. The village woke 
up. It was the dead of night. A massive number of armed troops 
were a few kilometers away from the site. At about 0200, after 
midnight, officers in the operations room in central Israel 
could sigh in relief. The helicopters carrying the kidnapped 
man were in the air, heading out to sea. They came under 
undirected antiaircraft gunfire, and after a flight that took 
over an hour, the raiding troops landed in central Israel to 
bask in deserved glory. 
  Even before landing to a warm reception from their 
commanders, they abandoned al-Dirani to his interrogators, who 
had spent so many years studying and analyzing his personality, 
movements, acts, and intentions. Some of them must have felt 
they were finally being reunited with an old acquaintance. 
  The sense of relief among the defense establishment 
leadership last Saturday, when they learned that al-Dirani's 
kidnapping had been an unqualified success, was in a way 
reminiscent of Friday, 18 October 1986 -- the day after Ron Arad 
dropped from his aircraft into south Lebanon. A big sigh of 
relief was heard in Israel then, too, after Amal officially 
announced that it was holding the navigator. Nabih al-Birri, 
who headed Amal at that time, had been banished from his country 
and was a persecuted refugee, a Syrian protegee, a terrified man 
staying at the Damascus Sheraton with his Jordanian wife and 
small children, yearning for prestige and money. Contacts were 
held, there were negotiations, there was a mediator, three 
letters were received from Ron Arad. The emerging deal was much 
cheaper than the one with Jibril. 
  Who would have thought then that an obscure man by the name 
of Mustafa al-Dirani, a former Amal security chief in the Tyre 
and Sidon area, who had not been particularly respected even by 
his colleagues, would reshuffle the cards. 
  In 1985, when he established the Believers Resistance as 
Amal's military apparatus, al-Dirani was still his loyal and 
pragmatic self. In 1987, he started showing signs of 
ideological independence from the organization's traditional 
leaders. As a result of this attitude, he was ousted from his 
position of Amal security apparatus chief in February 1988. 
According to foreign reports, he was banished, along with his 
associates Zakariya Hamza, 'Aql Hamiya, 'Ali Muhammad 
al-Husayni, 'Ali al-Jabar, Muhammad Faqiyah, Abu-'Ali Khalil, 
Muhammad Mubarak, Ahmad Harb, and others. Together with their 
supporters, they blended into the fundamentalist terrorist gangs 
that surround Hizballah and draw power either from the 
Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon or directly from the Iranian 
authorities. 
  During the Amal-Hizballah fighting in Beirut in May 1988, 
al- 
Dirani was already on the side of Hizballah. Together with his 
men, he took over one of the Amal commands in the Hariq area in 
southern Beirut, where, according to indications, Ron Arad was 
being held. Of all the prisoners in that installation, al-Dirani 
took one: the captive navigator. Since then, absolutely no 
negotiations for his release have been conducted. Hizballah, 
with Iranian consent, held contacts regarding the two 
servicemen, Fink and Alsheikh. For them, Ron Arad is 
untradable. He is a nest egg for a rainy day. 
  There is no reason for the Iranians to change their attitude 
as a result of al-Dirani's abduction. After Israel forms a 
genuine picture of the situation based on al-Dirani's 
interrogation, his fate will probably be similar to that of some 
of the previously kidnapped men: a television appearance, in 
which he will tell the world about Iran's direct involvement in 
the Ron Arad affair. That, too, is something. The Iranians are 
already preparing for such a possibility. In recent days, they 
have been using the Hizballah leaders, their emissaries in 
Lebanon, to convey a message: We have seen nothing, heard 
nothing; we do not know; he may be dead. 
  The enlightened world has slightly eased its pressure on 
Iran. A televised document featuring a terrorist of al-Dirani's 
stature may shake off a few layers of hypocrisy -- mainly that 
of West Europeans -- concerning cooperation with Iran and force 
them to renew the pressure on Tehran in the matter of the 
Israeli navigator. If it works -- after Ron Arad's seven years 
in captivity -- it will be a considerable achievement.

  [Text] The secretary-general of the Hizballah Islamic 
revolutionary movement of Lebanon met the foreign minister of 
our country ['Ali Akbar Velayati] in Damascus this morning. 
According to a report by the Central News Unit correspondent, 
at that meeting, which took place at the Iranian embassy, the 
latest developments in Lebanon -- especially the recent 
onslaught of the Zionist regime against the southern parts of 
that country -- were assessed. 
  Sayyid Hasan Nasrullah, describing the various aspects of 
this invasion, stressed: These provocations of the enemy will 
never be able to shake the resolve of the region's Muslims to 
liberate Islamic lands. He said: The presence of the masses of 
the Lebanese people, groups, and personalities in the funeral 
procession for the martyrs of this violent onslaught is 
indicative of the firm resolve of Muslims to remain steadfast 
and continue the path of the martyrs. 
  Mr. Velayati for his part expressed the condolences of the 
leadership, government, and people of Iran and emphasized: The 
Zionist's motive behind this aggression is the expansion of 
their domination over Islamic and Arab countries.

  [Text] Gaza, from Mustafa al-Sawwaf, AL-NAHAR Documentation 
and Press Office -- Dr. Ibrahim al-Yazuri, one of the leaders of 
Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, has 
stressed the need for postponing talks on forming a political 
party until things settle down and we can see how democratic the 
self-rule authority will be. 
  He said that the notion of forming an Islamic political 
party 
is good for presenting concepts from an Islamic perspective 
under the National Authority. But, he added, there are 
drawbacks, such as the need to obtain a permit from the 
Authority to set up such a party. This Authority has not been 
elected or established by the masses. 
  Al-Yazuri continued by saying that he is inclined to form an 
opposition front that includes all factions opposed to the 
agreement because this front, unlike a party, would not need a 
permit from the Authority. According to al-Yazuri, the 
Authority established by the agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo 
has conceded many Palestinian rights and there is nothing 
positive about it other than the return of the Palestinian 
police and deportees. 
  Al-Yazuri denied recent statements made by Major General 
Nasr 
Yusuf [commander of the Palestinian police] that the latter has 
contacted or met with Dr. al-Yazuri to discuss last week's 
incidents of kidnapping and killing agents. He stressed that he 
has no knowledge of such meetings or contacts, adding that this 
claim is baseless.

  [Text] Damascus, Ramallah, from Rashid Hilal -- Dr. George 
Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], has stated that, despite its 
refusal to participate in the self-rule authority's security and 
executive establishments, the PFLP will remain among the masses 
and keep its establishments because it is part of the social 
fabric of Palestinian society and its social structure. He said 
that the PFLP will not take a negative stand toward the 
establishments that serve the citizens but will seek to improve 
them and develop their social and national acts and performance 
in a way that serves our policies and views while extending the 
necessary services to the citizens. 
  In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Dr. Habash said that 
the way the Palestinian forces who reject the agreement will 
confront the Palestinian self-rule authority will not go outside 
the pragmatic forms which are now known to everyone -- 
political, and media struggle. He added: These forms will 
remain valid and suitable even after the implementation of the 
agreement. Any change in these forms will remain within this 
framework and we will not deviate from it as a rule, unless the 
Palestinian authority resorts to violence against the masses and 
forces that reject the agreement. He stressed that he will not 
be the first to resort to violence. 
  Habash noted that the loopholes in the agreement and its 
inherent contradictions are not enough to bring it down, but 
action is needed to turn the slogan of foiling the agreement 
into a practical one. He said that the forces rejecting the 
agreement are determined to formalize their opposition through 
effective and influential popular, mass, and political actions. 
  Habash stressed that these forces will seriously work to 
complete the widely based national and Islamic front and rebuild 
the PLO on national, democratic, and struggle bases in 
accordance with the national program and charter so as to allow 
as much participation as possible by most sectors of our people 
inside and outside the territories.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Al-Shaqaqi: Arrest of `Jihad' </F>
Members Will Redouble Its Operations Against the Occupation"] 
  [Text] Damascus, AL-HAYAH -- Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, 
secretary general of the "Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine," 
has stated that he held "indirect contacts" with Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat and the PLO leadership for the release 
of Jihad member Hani 'Abid who had been detained by the 
Palestinian police. He emphasized that the participation of the 
other Palestinian forces in the autonomy elections was "a good 
reason for us not to participate in them." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, al-Shaqaqi said that the 
military operations carried out by the "Islamic Mujahidin 
Forces" (QSM) [al-quwa al-islamiyah al-mujahidah] attached to 
the Movement "demonstrated that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza 
was not real, that Israeli sovereignty is still there, and that 
the authority in the Palestinian administration is Israel." 
  He said that, in his view, "the Palestinian security forces 
abducted Hani 'Abid to use him as a political hostage to make us 
stop our jihad operations." He added that he told the PLO 
leadership and President 'Arafat "indirectly that the arrest of 
our brothers would escalate military action against the 
occupation to prove to them (the PLO leadership) that they 
cannot blackmail us by detaining one of our brothers in the 
Movement." He also said that as long as long as 'Abid remains 
in detention "we will escalate military action, and (his 
continued detention) will not be a reason to stop (military 
action) as they hope. We will redouble our operations against 
the occupation until they convince us that the occupation has 
come to an end and that there is no Israeli presence in Gaza." 
  Asked why they have not been killing Palestinian "agents" or 
"collaborators" as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has 
been doing, al-Shaqaqi said: "We are extremely careful 
regarding the question of collaborators. The cases where the 
Jihad Movement killed collaborators were clear and flagrantly 
self-confessed. We do not act on mere suspicion or personal 
interrogation." He ruled out the possibility of the Jihad 
Movement killing "collaborators because the Palestinian police 
force is there and that matter is ultimately left to it." 
  After he reaffirmed his "absolute refusal to participate in 
the autonomy elections," AL-HAYAH remarked that other parties 
have contacted 'Arafat and are willing to do so. He replied: 
"That is a very good reason for us not to participate. Some, 
even a small minority, should uphold what is right, say no to 
this game loud and clear, and be the people's conscience."

<F P=106> [Report by the Abrar Media office in Gaza] </F>
  [Text] In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Shami, a prominent figure close to the Islamic 
Jihad in Gaza, has said that the group has recently been engaged 
in a political dialogue to find some formula for action through 
a political front [wajihah siyasiyah] that would avoid clashes 
with the Palestinian self-rule authority. 
  The cadres of the movement have almost unanimously agreed to 
establish a formula for public political, social, and cultural 
action through which the Islamic Jihad can perform its Islamic 
duty to further the Palestinian cause, he said. 
  Shaykh al-Shami, who served as the official spokesman for 
the 
Islamic Jihad deportees in Marj al-Zuhur in Lebanon, said the 
public front will not be a substitute for, but a backer of, the 
Islamic Jihad. 
  Asked if this political front will also be active in the 
West 
Bank areas that are not under the authority of the Palestinian 
self- rule council, Shaykh al-Shami explained that the 
establishment of the front is linked to the circumstantial 
change: the launching of the Palestinian self-rule authority. 
The front will operate only in the Palestinian autonomous 
region, he said. 
  Shaykh al-Shami believes the front will be open to all 
Palestinians who embrace Islam, are committed to it, and who 
work for the Palestinian cause. 
  On the possibility of the leaders of this front 
participating 
in the upcoming elections for the self-rule council, Shaykh 
al-Shami said it is not necessary for every political party or 
political front to participate in all elections or in the 
executive power. 
  Our clear political position, he said, is not to participate 
in the institutions of the self-rule, which the Islamic Jihad 
has opposed from the very beginning. 
  Asked about the issue of Hani 'Abid, a journalist close to 
the Islamic Jihad who has been detained by the Palestinian 
authorities for more than 10 days, al-Shami said that after 
several meetings between Palestinian security leaders and 
figures close to the Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian security 
leadership promised to release 'Abid within a few days. 
However, this did not happen and the Islamic Jihad is waiting 
for them to keep their promises, he said.

  [Text] Gen. Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian 
police force, has ordered all the imams in Gaza Strip mosques to 
halt all political activity in the mosques and to stop issuing 
calls against the autonomy authorities over loudspeakers. Our 
correspondent Nisim Qeynan reports that Nasr Yusuf also ordered 
to shut down the mosques after the last daily prayer, which 
usually ends at 2100. He also warned the imams against 
nonreligious activity in the mosques. The Islamic movement in 
the Gaza Strip has expressed opposition to and anger over 
Yusuf's directives and over the fact that the Palestinian police 
is hampering its activity. 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1130 GMT on 6 June adds: 
"Nasr Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police in Gaza, has 
been removed from his position as the Palestinian national 
security commander [as heard], apparently against the background 
of the sharp verbal clashes between him and Hamas (Islamic 
Resistance Movement). He will be replaced by 'Abd-al-Razzaq 
al-Majayirah, who headed the Palestinian delegation for security 
talks with Israel. Recently there have been sharp clashes 
between Nasr Yusuf and extremist Muslims in Gaza against the 
background of Yusuf's demand to disarm Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
activists, and also in the wake of the incarceration of Hani 
al-'Abd, an Islamic Jihad activist. This is reported by our 
Arab Affairs correspondent Oren Kohen."]

  [Excerpts] Palestinian leaders in the territories are 
focusing efforts on East Jerusalem, mainly in a bid to lift the 
closure which has separated the city from the rest of the 
territories. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has 
distributed a leaflet in the territories calling for an 
exacerbation of the battle until Jerusalem is liberated. Our 
correspondent Moti Amir reports: 
  [Begin Amir recording] [passage omitted] Hamas has also 
exhorted its followers to put an emphasis on the struggle over 
Jerusalem. In a special leaflet distributed in the territories 
yesterday, 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam members were called upon to 
step up activities against Israel until what the leaflet 
described as the liberation of all of the homeland, including 
Jerusalem. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "An Islamic Party Takes Up Arms </F>
Against the Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- Some members of the Algerian 
Transitional National Council members are trying to collect 
signatures on a petition calling for the release of the Islamic 
Salvation Front [FIS] leaders and an end to the state of 
emergency. The deputies trying to promote the petition say that 
the aim is to "support dialogue and national reconciliation." 
AL-HAYAH has learned that the party most opposed to that 
petition is the Islamic "Jihad and Unity Front" which is 
represented in the National Council by Nouari Bousnan (aged 41) 
and Kerghali Saeed (40). Sources close to that front have told 
AL-HAYAH that its leader has formed an armed battalion for 
combating "terrorism" (the word used by the authorities to 
describe the Salvation Front) in the province of El Bouira (120 
km east of the capital), active in Rabta mountains and in 
Boufadil [as transliterated] in the hills of the Kadiria 
District. The same sources confirm that the security forces 
have reinforced that battalion with some soldiers and that the 
initial results of the combing operations "have been 
encouraging." According to Algerian observers, this is the 
first time an Islamic party has participated in military 
operations alongside the Algerian security forces.

  [Text] Algiers, June 8 (AFP)--Gunmen shot dead three people 
as they tried to prevent a car bomb attack against a hotel in an 
Algiers suburb, before the blast seriously wounded three others, 
the EL WATAN daily reported Wednesday. 
  The three men gunned down were all guests at the El Andalous 
hotel in the Eucalyptus district, a Moslem fundamentalist 
bastion of the capital, which was targetted on Monday night. 
  The bomb placed in the boot of the vehicle then exploded, 
badly injuring three people and causing major damage, the 
newspaper reported. 
  The blast was the third car bomb attack since Islamic 
extremists began a guerrilla war against the Algerian 
authorities early in 1992 and subsequently began targetting 
civilians as part of their campaign. 
  More than 3,000 people are estimated to have been killed in 
battles between armed gangs and security forces and in terrorist 
attacks, which began after the army in January 1992 cancelled a 
general election the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was 
poised to win.

worshipers at al-Sahabah Mosque in the town of Akhmim in the 
Governorate of Suhaj and a number of extremist elements 
recently.

took place at all, as the agency claimed. 
  A news agency had reported that six people, including two 
extremists, were injured in a confrontation between worshipers 
and elements which it described as terrorist in al-Sahabah

<F P=106> [Report by Najwa 'Abd-al-'Aziz] </F>
  [Text] Counselor 'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf-al-Din, Public 
Attorney at the Higher State Security Prosecution Office, 
yesterday decided to remand in custody members of a Muslim 
Brotherhood [MB] organization for 15 days pending 
investigations. He ordered the items seized with the members to 
be sent for examination by forensic and laboratory experts. 
  Security men have arrested 11 members of the organization in 
several governorates. They include doctors, education experts, 
furniture dealers, students, and civil servants. Investigations 
conducted by District Attorney Sharif 'Abd-al-Nabi and Hisham 
Badawi with the organization members have uncovered secret cells 
formed by the organization in four governorates. According to 
the investigations, the new organization is an extension of the 
"Salsabil" organization uncovered a few years ago. The 
prosecutors charged members of the new organization with forming 
a consultative council, planning the overthrow of the regime, 
and preparing antiregime organizational documents and leaflets. 
The members used computers to keep information, and computer 
discs have been seized. The defendants informed officials on the 
remaining members of the organization in the other governorates. 
The prosecutors charged them with joining a secret organization 
that seeks to overthrow the regime.

<F P=106> [Report by Wadi' Kirulus] </F>
  [Text] For years the government has turned a blind eye to 
the political and social activities of the Muslim Brotherhood, 
despite being outlawed since 1954. But during the past few 
weeks, there have been increasing signs of a strain in the 
Brotherhood's relationship with the government. 
  The first sign was an anti-government demonstration, in 
protest at the death in police custody of a lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani, staged by members of the 
Brotherhood-controlled Bar Association and which police 
dispersed immediately. Thirty-six lawyers were arrested. 
  A few days later, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a prominent 
Islamic scholar, was instructed by security authorities not to 
deliver a sermon during prayers marking 'Id al-Adha at the 
Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Muhandisin. Al-Ghazali was later 
received by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, in what was viewed 
as a conciliatory gesture. 
  Around the same time, 84-year-old Shaykh Hamid Abu-al-Nasr, 
the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, was summoned for 
questioning by prosecution authorities after leaflets bearing 
his name were seized during the 'Id prayers. The ailing Shaykh 
did not comply and the order was subsequently cancelled. 
  On Monday, Al-Alfi announced that "a group of Brotherhood 
members have been arrested for anti-state activity." The 
newspaper AL- SHA'B, mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labour 
Party, put their number at eight and said their arrest was "part 
of the escalating government campaign against the Brotherhood." 
The eight, who include Ibrahim Sharaf, the private secretary of 
the supreme guide, were remanded in custody for 15 days, the 
newspaper said. 
  Mustafa Mashhur, a deputy of the supreme guide, told 
AL-AHRAM 
WEEKLY he was surprised by the government's actions because "we 
are exercising all our activities, whether in the People's 
Assembly or in professional syndicates or teachers' cubs, within 
the framework of the constitution and under the umbrella of the 
law." He said the Brotherhood has not been involved in any act 
of violence since it resurfaced during the 1970s. "We even 
condemned such acts," he said. 
  The reason for the clampdown, Mashhur said, could be the 
anti- government slogans shouted by lawyers during their 
demonstration. But Mashhur denied that those lawyers were 
Brotherhood members. 
  Another reason, Mashhur said, could be the government's 
intention to deny the Brotherhood the right to establish a 
political party. "They think that if we have an Islamic party, 
the Copts will demand a party of their own and this will lead to 
civil strife. But this is not true." 
  Despite the latest arrests, the Brotherhood is carrying on 
with its normal activities and "will not be involved in any 
escalation, even if the government steps up its measures," 
Mashhur said. 
  'Isam al-'Aryan, secretary-general of the Doctors Union and 
a 
leading member of the Brotherhood, said he was not worried by 
the latest arrests because "this is a pattern to which previous 
governments resorted on previous occasions." The reason for the 
clampdown, he said, could be a government attempt to bar the 
Brotherhood from the national dialogue or from parliamentary 
elections scheduled for next year. 
  Muhammad Salim al-'Awwa, a lawyer described as a 
representative of the moderate Islamic trend, said he was 
surprised by recent events because the Brotherhood has 
distributed leaflets for years and they were never confiscated 
and the supreme guide was never summoned for questioning. He 
described the government's actions as a "political and religious 
mistake" because the Brotherhood is a "strong political and 
religious supporter of the constitutional system." 
  Political analyst Muhammad Sid-Ahmad believes the motive 
behind the government clampdown is to exclude the Brotherhood 
from the national dialogue. "There are two reasons for this. 
First, the government is not prepared to recognise it to 
prevent the emergence of an Islamic party, then a Christian 
party etc. The second reason is the government's wish to 
maintain the legitimacy of the dialogue" by excluding illegal 
organisations, he said. But Sid-Ahmad believes the Brotherhood 
will be indirectly represented at the dialogue via Ibrahim 
Shukri, leader of the Labour Party. 
  Another political analyst, Tagammu [National Progressive 
Unionist Grouping] secretary-general Rif'at al-Sa'id, who keeps 
a close watch on the Islamist movement, said the government has 
tolerated the Brotherhood for years because it considered it 
harmless but was waking up to its "danger." 
  "There is no moderation in the Islamist current. The 
Brotherhood is an extremist organisation that calls for the 
establishment of an Islamic state. The violent history of the 
Brotherhood speaks for itself," al-Sa'id added. 
  The Brotherhood instigated the lawyers' demonstration to 
cover up for "severe financial malpractices" by the Bar 
Association's Council, he continued. The demonstration as well 
as televised statements by repentant terrorist 'Adil 
'Abd-al-Baqi, implicating the Brotherhood in acts of terrorism, 
made the government wake up to the "danger" of the Brotherhood, 
he commented. 
  Asked if the Brotherhood was expected to retaliate for the 
government clampdown, Al-Sa'id replied negatively. "On the 
contrary, they will kneel down in order to be accepted."

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Kamal] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mustafa Mashhur, the strong 
man in the Muslim Brotherhood, denies any link between the group 
and violence. In an interview with ROSE AL-YUSUF, he said: Our 
method since we came out of prison has been not to participate 
in any incident. Our connection with any extremist group has 
not been proven, from Shaykh al-Dhahabi [murdered by the 
Repudiation and Renunciation group], the Military Technical 
School incidents, the assassination of [former president] 
al-Sadat, to the Asyut incidents. We in fact have issued 
several statements criticizing violence. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF: The repentant al-Shawqiyun Group 
leader has accused you of supporting terrorism with money. 
  Mashhur: I have no knowledge of that. Let them 
investigate. If it is proven that Ahmad 'Ubayd (the man named by 
'Adil 'Abd-al- Baqi in his confessions) or any one else has done 
so, let them bring them to account. But the Muslim Brotherhood 
has nothing to do with this. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF: Don't you have any connection with 
Ahmad 'Ubayd? 
  Mashhur: I mean that we have nothing to do with 
the money, and Ahmad 'Ubayd has not informed us that he gave 
money. 
  ROSE AL-YUSUF: Does the Muslim Brotherhood intend 
to escalate the situation and declare civil disobedience in the 
professional unions? 
  Mashhur: Our method is moderation, and not 
violence, capitulation, and weakness. We are carrying out a 
message. This is the right of every citizen. It is my right to 
say that Islam is the solution, just as others say socialism is 
the solution. Actually, we exist legally, but it is they [the 
government] who do not want to recognize us. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In a major breakthrough, the Delhi police has 
arrested a Hizbul Mujahideen militant and two of his associates 
who were in the process of establishing a country-wide terrorist 
network. 
  They were trying to carry out their mission with the help of 
fundamentalist organisations in various towns and cities, 
including Delhi. 
  Their objective was to target prominent Kashmiri political 
leaders and spread terror among the general population. 
  Police picked up Mushtaq Ahmed, 28 and his associate 
Khaliq-u- Zaman, 30 on Sunday from near a Mazhar in Adarsh Nagar 
in North West Delhi where the two had rendezvoused. 
  A Chinese pistol with 8 rounds and 4 stick grenades were 
recovered fIom their possession. Another associate, Shahid Anis 
Azmi, 18 was earlier arrested by a team of Delhi Police in 
Bombay from where he was operating for the past few months. 
  Their interrogation revealed that they were on a specific 
mission to establish a terrorist network in metropolitan towns 
by recruiting local Muslim youth who were later trained in arms 
and explosives in Kashmir. 
  An organisation called the Minorities United Front (MUF) had 
been floated by the Hizbul Mujahideen for this purpose in 
December 1992 in the aftermath of the demolition of the disputed 
structure at Ayodhya. 
  Additional police commissioner (CID) R S Gupta said on 
Monday 
that Mushtaq Ahmed, a resident of Anantnag, acting on orders of 
Hizbul Chief Salauddin, was coordinating the search for 
potential Muslim recruits. 
  The entire operation brought into open the hand of 
Pakistan's 
ISI, he added. 
  After having enrolled himself in the Unani Medical College 
in 
Gaya in mid-1993, Ahmed had been visiting various hotbeds of 
fundamentalism in Bihar and UP for identifying Muslim youth. 
  Ahmed contacted various madrasas in Etawah, Muzaffamagar, 
Gaya, Calcutta and Bombay. Cells were set up in these places and 
many youth were taken to Kashmir for training in arms and 
explosives. 
  The objective was to create a team of dedicated youth owing 
allegiance to Hizbul Mujahideen and willing to undertake various 
terrorist activities including the assassination of top 
political leaders connected with Kashmir. 
  According to Gupta, most of the recruits belonged to Muslim 
fundamentalist bodies such as the Students Islamic Movement of 
India (SIMI), Students Islamic Organisation (SIO) and Aljehad, 
organisation active in Western UP. 
  Both Khaliq-u-Zaman and Shahid Anis Azmi were active workers 
of SIMI. Khaliq-u-Zaman, who belongs to Hamirpur in UP, worked 
in the Delhi office of SIMI and joined the MUF around six months 
back. 
  After receiving arms training in Anantnag, he helped recruit 
two boys from Etawah who were also later sent to Kashmir for 
training. Shahid Anis Azmi, who originally hails from Azamgarh 
in UP, was associated with the SIMI office in Bombay and joined 
the MUF in 1993. He had since been helping Ahmed recruit Muslim 
youth. 
  A fourth associate, Assadullah, who is presently in the 
custody of the Calcutta police, also figures as a prominent 
member of the network. 
  Assadullah, who is to be brought to the Capital shortly by 
the Delhi Police, was working for the SIO and had been making 
frequent forays into Bangladesh to create hide-outs there for 
the terrorists to escape after carrying out their mission in the 
country. 
  Ahmed has revealed that at least eight youth had been 
recruited so far from various towns and cities to function as 
agents of the Hizbul Mujahideen. 
  Police officials, however, said the figure could be higher. 
Efforts were on to get more information of the activities of 
Ahmed and his associates from some key documents seized from him. 
  Telephone numbers from an electronic wrist watch which Ahmed 
was wearing at the time of his arrest are also being 
investigated. 
  Ahmed has also revealed that a weapons consignment in two 
trucks had been dispatched from Kashmir to various areas in the 
country. Police were making efforts to locate the destination of 
the consignment. 
  Police officials said that although the group had not 
carried 
out any strike, plans were at an advanced stage for terrorist 
strikes in Delhi and Calcutta and funds in this regard had 
already been distributed. 
  The arrested persons were booked under the Arms Act, 
Explosives Act and TADA and remanded to police custody on 
Monday. Further investigations are on.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 7 (AFP) -- Suspected Muslim rebels 
kidnapped two British hikers in the northern state of Kashmir 
Tuesday as the army patrolled a southern town after the murder 
of a Hindu leader, the Press Trust of India said. 
  Pushtu-language speaking rebels abducted 16-year-old Kim 
Housego and David Mackie, 36, at Aroo near the resort town of 
Pahalgam, the news agency quoted officials as saying in the 
Kashmir summer capital Srinagar. 
  No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the 
first of British nationals in Kashmir since 1989, when the 
Muslim separatist drive became violent. 
  A Foreign Office report from London said Housego's parents 
were also kidnapped but released later to transmit the demand of 
the rebels seeking the release of three comrades being held by 
Indian authorities. 
  Housego's father David, formerly a New Delhi-based 
correspondent of the Financial Times, reported the abduction to 
police, officials said. 
  Meanwhile, army soldiers patrolled the curfew-bound town of 
Bhaderwah in the southern district of Doda to prevent violence 
following the gunning down of Hindu leader Rocher Kumar of the 
Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party, BJP). 
  Kumar was shot dead by unidentified militants in his house 
early Tuesday. His killers fled but the murder sparked clashes 
and arson attacks in which at least 10 houses were torched, 
officials said. 
  A curfew was clamped in Bhaderwah and the nearby town of 
Kishtwar, both of which are described as "communally sensitive." 
  Officials said 11 more people died overnight Monday in 
gunbattles linked to the Muslim rebel campaign for secession 
from India. India and neighbouring Pakistan have fought two of 
their three wars over the disputed state.

  [Text] In the Kashmir valley, efforts are on to secure 
safe release of [words missing] militants near Pahalgam two days 
ago. Three other members of the trekking team have returned to 
Srinagar. A number of organizations have appealed to the 
militants to release the innocent trekkers. 
  Two Pakistan-trained militants were killed in Kupwara 
District in an encounter with the security force. Four 
militants were arrested and a large quantity of arms and 
ammunition was recovered. 
  [Hong Kong AFP in English at 1307 GMT on 9 Jun 94 in a 
report 
adds the following: "Kashmiri separatist groups Thursday 
demanded the immediate release of two British hikers kidnapped 
by Moslem militants while trekking in the Himalayas. 
  'The Indian authorities, meanwhile, rejected the demand by 
the Moslem rebels who snatched the two British nationals that 
three of their imprisoned leaders be freed in exchange for the 
hostages. 
  'David Mackie, 36, a video producer from London, and Kim 
Housego, 16, the son of the former Financial Times correspondent 
in New Delhi, were abducted in the Himalayan foothills southeast 
of here by three heavily-armed men claiming to be members of the 
militant outfit Harkat-ul-Ansar or Movement of Friends. 
  'In a note left for Kim Housego's father, David, the 
kidnappers demanded the release of three of the group's leaders 
from Indian jails and warned foreign tourists to stay out of 
Kashmir. 
  "Their release is not possible," a government official told 
AFP. 
  The latest kidnapping was forcefully condemned by the two 
most powerful Kashmiri Moslem militant groups, the Jammu and 
Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) which seeks independence for 
Kashmir and the pro-Pakistan Hizbul Mujahideen. 
  "Such moves help India at the international level," the JKLF 
said in an unconditional appeal for the release of the Britons. 
  The Hizbul Mujahideen, or Party of Moslem Warriors, called 
on 
the kidnappers to immediately release the Britons in the 
interests of the Kashmiri separatist movement. 
  "We have offered our help to identify these people," said 
Majid Jehangir, the second-ranking leader of the Hizbul 
Mujahideen, which helped rescue a Portuguese engineer who was 
kidnapped by a group opposed to a power project in the state two 
years ago. 
  Both the JKLF and the Hizbul Mujahideen raised the 
possibility that the kidnapping may be the handiwork of Indian 
agents seeking to discredit the secessionist movement. 
  In a statement released here Wednesday, the Harkat-ul-Ansar 
claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and said it was done 
to attract world attention to human rights abuses by Indian 
troops battling the insurgency. 
  The Jamiat-ul-Islami, the Hizb's political wing, denounced 
the abduction by the group and appealed for the release of the 
two "guests" without "delay or harm." 
  "It is unwise to commit such a human rights violation and 
then suggest that it would help focus world attention on gross 
rights abuses by Indian security forces," said Jamiat leader 
Ghulam Mohammed Bhat.']

<F P=106> [Interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar </F>
Velayati by al-Sayyid al-Mallah and Ahmad al-Suyufi in 
Cairo--date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [AL-SHA'B] The question citizens in both Cairo 
and Tehran must hear is what happened in your talks with 
Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa? [passage omitted] 
  Velayati: If you mean the establishment of 
official diplomatic ties, this was not discussed during the 
meeting, which lasted one whole hour. However, what was 
discussed during the meeting was everything that has to do with 
joint cooperation between the two countries in international 
forums. In addition, we discussed all the international issues 
of interest to the two countries, such as Palestine, the war in 
Yemen, and the future of the Nonaligned Movement and the Islamic 
Conference Organization. [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHA'B: Now we come to the most thorny issue, 
the long- standing accusation that the Islamic Republic of Iran 
is exporting terrorism to the Islamic World, and even around the 
world. What do you have to say about this accusation? 
  Velayati: This is not new; Iran is not the first 
country to be accused of such things. During the 'Abd-al-Nasir 
era, Egypt itself was subjected to such accusations. 
  This is an old weapon the West uses to put pressure on 
countries, especially those who refuse to submit to the control 
of the Western powers. None of those who have leveled this 
accusation can actually prove it. It is no more than dangling 
the sword of Damocles over the heads of those who go against 
Western and Zionist views. [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHA'B: You have good ties with Syria, so what 
would you do if Syria concluded a peace agreement with Israel? 
Would this affect your relations? 
  Velayati: We are against any agreement with Israel 
by any party. This does not mean that we are not aware of the 
kind of pressure to which Syria is being subjected by all sides. 
Suffice it to mention here the numerous campaigns directed 
against Lebanon, Syria's closest neighbor. If such agreements 
were signed, naturally it would affect our bilateral relations. 
We still consider Syria the only major country left to confront 
Israeli domination. [passage omitted] 
  AL-SHA'B: Undoubtedly, you have made 
contributions on the Bosnia issue. But the Islamic world 
expected you in particular to take a more effective and 
influential stand than you have taken so far. Why have you 
taken such a stand? 
  Velayati: I was in Sarajevo last month. I do not 
wish to tell you what we did there, but I will quote public 
statements by President Alija Izetbegovic to correspondents: 
All aspects of the Iranian role in Bosnia will go down in 
history. Had it not been for Iran, Bosnia would not be in the 
condition we see it in today. Iran has so far provided many 
forms of aid. It has also made a proposal to give military aid. 
  Velayati then added: A few days ago, THE WASHINGTON POST 
published an article in which it confirmed that Iranian planes 
had transported shipments of arms to Bosnia. Irrespective of 
the truth of this report, we do is not rule out this kind of 
undertaking in dealing with Bosnia, where we have seen forms of 
ugliness unknown to us before. 
  AL-SHA'B: Before we end this dialogue, we wish to 
learn about your stand on what you call the state of the "great 
Satan?" 
  Velayati: [passage missing] It is the same old 
stand. There is nothing new in it. We have no objections to 
establishing cordial relations with any party on condition that 
that party respects our causes and does not support our enemies.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Three Experts in Iranian Nuclear </F>
Program Abducted"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Gunmen have 
abducted a Chinese engineer and two of his Iranian companions in 
southeast Iran. 
  A statement issued by the Interior Ministry in Tehran 
yesterday pointed out that the Chinese citizen, whose identity 
is not known yet, was working on the uranium mining project in 
Rudan. The policy of developing uranium resources is considered 
part of Iran's nuclear program, that is with technological 
support from China and North Korea. It is believed that the 
three abducted people handle very sensitive information 
concerning Iran's nuclear program. It is not clear whether the 
abduction operation is political in nature or was carried out by 
a gang of robbers active in that area. 
  The abduction of foreign nationals has over the past few 
months become a big problem for the government in many parts of 
Iran. In January, a 22-year-old Australian tourist disappeared 
while on his way to Shiraz, capital of the south. There has 
been no news of him since. In February and March, three North 
Korean technicians said to have been working on military 
projects near the Gulf were abducted. They still have not been 
released. 
  Last month, the body of a North Korean man was found near 
Ahvaz, capital of Khuzestan. It was said that someone lured him 
and then killed him for unknown reasons. 
  The government has advised foreign nationals not to leave 
major cities individually. Excursions organized for European 
tourists have been canceled or their routes altered to avoid the 
danger of being attacked by armed gunmen on the road. 
  The Iranian Interior Ministry's report shows a big increase 
in all types of crimes, from small-scale riots through to 
organized and large-scale armed robbery and murder. This 
coincided with the smuggling of thousands of arms from Pakistan 
and Afghanistan to all areas in east and south Iran. Sometimes 
convoys of smuggled goods and drugs travel for hundreds of miles 
inside Iranian areas, protected by armed groups supported by 
personnel carries and tanks. 
  The number of foreign nationals working in Iran is estimated 
at about 18,000, compared with 1.2 million before the mullahs' 
revolution in 1979. But there are also 2.2 million Afghan 
refugees, 1.2 million Iraqi refugees, mostly Kurds and Shiites, 
and at least 1.2 million illegal immigrants from Pakistan, 
Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan.

<F P=106> [Report by Eli Bohadana] </F>
  [Excerpt] A few hours ago, terrorists opened fire at the 
hothouses of Kfar Darom in the Gaza Strip, but nobody was hurt. 
An IDF [Israel Defense Forces] unit arrived on the scene and 
opened fire at the terrorists, who fled in two Peugeot 404's. 
  Last night, the IDF set out in hot pursuit of a Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] terrorist squad into the area of 
the autonomy. The three terrorists who opened fire at an IDF 
patrol fled in the direction of Rafah. Our forces did not 
sustain any casualties. During the pursuit, hundreds of local 
inhabitants gathered and threw stones at the soldiers in a bid 
to prevent them from catching the perpetrators. According to 
Palestinian sources, five local Palestinians were injured by IDF 
gunfire during this pursuit. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Today it was revealed that a network of 15 Jewish 
and Israeli Arab weapons dealers who sold weapons and ammunition 
to fugitives from the territories has been uncovered. Our 
correspondent Yafa Glick reports that the Tel Aviv Magistrate's 
Court today remanded two Netanya shooting gallery owners, Avi 
Hajaj and Shim'on Farhan, and one of the workers, Yosi 
Yankelevich. The three are suspected of having sold weapons and 
ammunition to six Israeli Arabs from al-Tira and Qalansuwa, who 
in turn sold the weapons to fugitives from Nabulus, Bayt Lahiyah 
in the Gaza Strip, and Tulkarm.

  [Text] Major General Uri Sagi, head of the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] Intelligence Branch, said today that he believes 
that the basic goals of the PLO and Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] will not change, although they are undergoing a 
pragmatic adaptation to the political reality. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Gen. Sagi made the remarks 
at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
  Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said that he had obtained 
information from the defense establishment according to which 
the government intends to free 400 Hamas and Islamic Jihad 
activists, and inquired as to the impact this move would have on 
the security situation. Gen. Sagi said he cannot deny this 
information, adding that it is obvious that if those prisoners 
are released, some of them will engage in terror activity.

toured the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Northern Command and 
south Lebanon. [passage omitted] 
  Senior military sources said despite the fact that no 
katyushas have been fired by Hizballah since Friday they are 
continuing their activity in the security zone. 
  The sources say that the terrorists are trying to plant 
explosive charges, to attack outposts, and to kidnap soldiers. 
The terrorists are also trying to smuggle suicide squads into 
the security zone for attacks against IDF and SLA [South 
Lebanese Army] forces. 
  "We are convinced that Hizballah will try to carry out a 
spectacular attack in retaliation for the Air Force attack," 
said a senior Northern Command source.

  [Text] It will be impossible over the long term to 
guarantee the safety of the settlers in Gaza Strip settlements 
and over a thousand kilometers of roads in Judaea and Samaria, a 
senior army source said on Friday. 
  The senior General Staff source said that in the Gaza Strip 
over 15,000 soldiers are occupied with protecting 4,500 settlers. 
  "At no stage during the negotiations did the army recommend 
a 
course of action based on an inability to defend settlements, 
but in the longer term, it will be impossible to maintain 
full-proof [as published] security," said the source. 
  As for Judaea and Samaria, the source said the IDF [Israel 
Defense Forces] expects a rise in violence by Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement], and does not rule out riots in the major 
cities if the economic situation of the Palestinian population 
continues to deteriorate, or if the self-rule process fails to 
progress. 
  "The PLO will try to co-opt Hamas into the political 
institutions being established, but we do not rule out a 
scenario in which economic hardships and political uncertainty 
combine to strengthen Hamas in the street," said the source. 
  He added that while the territories are now relatively 
quiet, 
there are indications that Hamas plans violent activities. 
  "One new phenomenon in Judaea and Samaria is the use of more 
sophisticated roadside bombs, detonated by wireless remote 
control devices. It is difficult to detect these devices, which 
is why it is difficult to guarantee the safety of settlers and 
soldiers moving on the main roads," he said. 
  "There are over 20 platoons currently deployed in Judaea and 
Samaria, whose sole mission is to maintain road and settlement 
safety. These soldiers are not training as they ought to, and I 
do not think this can go on endlessly without compromising the 
quality of your military force," he added.

  [Text] The dispute between Hizballah Secretary General 
Hasan Nasrallah and Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has 
intensified after Nasrallah backed the publication of a book 
entitled "Observations on Sayyid Fadlallah's Method." The 
dispute has grown to include their entourages and loyalists. 
Asked about this issue, Fadlallah declared: "I do not trust 
any of Hizballah's leaders... without exception." 
  A dispute has likewise surfaced between Nasrallah and 
Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik , 
who is also director of Hizballah's religious school in 
Ba'labakk. Nasrallah has been giving cover to Shaykh Yazbik's 
rivals. One sign of the dispute was Nasrallah's insistence on 
employing Shaykh As'ad Balluq at the school. Shaykh Yazbik 
insisted on expelling Balluq. 
  Nasrallah realizes that he has lost all his religious 
credentials and his credibility inside Hizballah and is giving 
serious thought to his future after he leaves the secretary 
general's post. He has established and will be director of the 
Islamic Institute for Education, which supervises the Imam Mahdi 
schools in several Lebanese areas. It should be noted that the 
funds that Nasrallah is spending on this institution are 
actually part of Hizballah's budget. He urges Hizballah members 
to be economical and then diverts the party's funds to expand 
his institution. Nasrallah refuses to employ any one in the 
institution who is not blindly loyal and obedient to him. 
  Observers note that military operations carried out by the 
Islamic Resistance have recently been few and feeble. The 
reason is the secretary general's appropriation of funds for his 
own institution. He is also using Hizballah media to make 
publicity for the Imam Mahdi schools. 
  [A brief report on page 9 of the same issue of AL-SHIRA' 
reads: "Recent organizational changes in Hizballah indicate that 
former party secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli will 
regain his influence over Hizballah's decisionmaking process."] 
  [AL-SHIRA' also reports on page 10: "The Zionist enemy's 
criminal abduction of the Faithful Resistance official Mustafa 
al-Dirani from his house in Qasr Naba provided Hizballah 
Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah with an opportunity to make a 
grand entrance into al-Biqa' following recent negative attitudes 
and resentment against him by area residents and party members. 
Some of his few supporters in the area sought to invent 
occasions for him to attend to give the impression that he is 
still strong in al-Biqa'. The results were disappointing. 
During the al-Ghadir Day poetry festival in Marjat Ra's al-'Ayn 
in Ba'labakk, Nasrallah's loyalists did all they could to 
mobilize a large party turnout but the area's ulema boycotted 
the festival and only 18 out of 100 al-Biqa' scholars attended. 
Hizballah Consultative Council member Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik 
was also absent."]

    [Editorial Report] Beirut AL-'AHD in Arabic devotes most of 
its 27 May 1994 edition to reactions to the abduction of Mustafa 
al- Dirani, a leader of the Faithful Resistance, by a "Zionist" 
commando unit. 
  On page 5 the paper publishes an approximately 550-word 
report on a statement issued by the Bloc of Loyalty to the 
Resistance [Hizballah's parliamentary group] condemning the 
kidnapping of al- Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, "a symbol of the 
Faithful Resistance." The statement says: "This cowardly 
operation was a blatant defiance and an impudent provocation 
against the resisting Lebanon. It also clearly reveals the 
policy of indifference being pursued by the authority regarding 
the country's primary issues, foremost being the political and 
military confrontation of the Zionist designs of hegemony." 
  On the same page, the paper publishes an approximately 
250-word report on an address delivered by scholar Ibrahim Amin 
al-Sayyid, chairman of the Bloc of Loyalty to the Resistance, 
during a memorial service. Having accused the state of inaction 
on the abduction of al-Dirani, al-Sayyid says: "The Lebanese 
people are no longer living under the protection of a state 
because it is incapable of achieving security and safeguarding 
the people's dignity." 
  On page 6, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 3,000-word 
text 
of a statement issued by representatives of the Lebanese and 
Palestinian nationalist and Islamic parties and forces at the 
end of their meeting held at the invitation of the Faithful 
Resistance to discuss the Israeli "act of piracy" in kidnapping 
al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani, a leader of the Faithful Resistance; 
the date of the meeting was not given. Among those attending 
the meeting was Hizballah Political Bureau Chairman al-Hajj 
Husayn al-Khalil and representatives of "the Socialist Arab 
Ba'th Party, the Progressive Socialist Party, the Syrian Social 
Nationalist Party, the Socialist Labor Party, the Nasirite 
Popular Organization, the Union Party, the Islamic Amal 
Movement, the Congress Party, Fatah Movement--the Revolutionary 
Council, the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, the Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, the 
Islamic al-Da'wah Party in Iraq, the Islamic Group, the Islamic 
Resistance Movement--Hamas, the detainees follow-up committee, 
the Muslim Ulema Council, the Jabal 'Amil Ulema Committee, the 
secular conference, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation 
of Palestine." The conferees issued a statement, which says in 
part: "The participants demand that the Lebanese Government 
adopt a stance commensurate with the popular position expressed 
by the conferees to withdraw from the settlement negotiations, 
which continue to represent a cover for ceaseless Zionist crimes 
and attacks." The statement adds that "the conferees stress the 
need for the authority to adopt the option of resistance in the 
face of the enemy's plans and to support our resisting people in 
all fields and domains for the sake of liberating the land and 
safeguarding the holy places." 
  On page 7 AL-'AHD publishes approximately 1,000 words of 
statements by various Lebanese officials and deputies in 
reaction to the kidnapping operation. His Eminence Shaykh 
Zuhayr Kanj, member of the Muslim Ulema Council, "notes that the 
timing of the operation, just five days after Warren 
Christopher's visit to the region, indicates the State 
Department's involvement in the operation." He blames the local 
authority and the Lebanese Government for negligence toward "the 
act of piracy." Kanj calls on the prime minister to "resign 
immediately because he is no longer capable to run the country 
and because his policies have proved futile." 
  On page 9 the paper publishes an approximately 700-word 
interview with Deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Yaghi, member of the Bloc 
of Loyalty to the Resistance, place and date not given. He 
condemns the kidnapping of al-Hajj al-Dirani and says: "We must 
tell the Lebanese authorities that after the Zionist act of 
piracy that dereliction and negligence on the part of the 
government toward the basic issues, including the confrontation 
of the Zionist enemy's schemes and plots, are unacceptable 
policies for which the government must be held accountable." 
Yaghi adds: "It is useless to lodge a complaint with the 
Security Council as long as the U.S. Administration is the 
international power broker and also the unrepentent supporter of 
Zionist terrorism." He adds: "The only useful recourse is to 
support the resistance with every available means because 
resistance is the only appropriate reply to the continuing 
aggression and arrogance." 
  On the same page, AL-'AHD publishes an approximately 
2,000-word political and security analysis by Ibrahim 
Shams-al-Din of the kidnapping operation. The writer refutes 
the Israeli objectives and excuses behind the kidnapping 
operation, noting that the kidnapping will not give Israel any 
information about the whereabouts of Israeli navigator Ron Arad, 
simply because al-Dirani knows nothing about the Israeli pilot. 
The writer then discusses the "principles that should be upheld 
by the government to eliminate the loopholes that contributed 
toward the success of the terrorist operation." Shams-al-Din 
adds: "It is necessary that the government change the list of 
its priorities and give precedence to the issue of liberation. 
The government should close the gaps through which the Zionists 
penetrate the homeland's security and sovereignty." Shams- 
al-Din goes adds that "the Lebanese authority should take 
sufficient interest in the cause of the Lebanese detainees held 
in Israeli prisons. The government should investigate the 
recent kidnapping operation and unveil the identity of the 
collaborators, who, according to various stories, guided the 
enemy forces to the landing spot and to roads leading to the 
house of al-Dirani."

  [Text] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 8 (AFP)--Pro-Iranian 
Hizballah guerrillas kidnapped six Lebanese and a retired Syrian 
soldier Wednesday in Syrian-controlled eastern Lebanon, police 
said. 
  Lebanese and Syrian security services had contacted the 
group 
late Wednesday in a bid to secure their release, they said. The 
seven were not identified. 
  Witnesses said that three people were beaten and seized from 
their homes by Hizballah members, while the four others were 
taken in public places in Ba'labakk and its surroundings. 
  Security services said the seven could have been taken in a 
Hizballah sweep to investigate the kidnapping on May 21 of 
pro-Iranian guerrilla leader Mustafa al-Dirani who was seized 
from his home in a raid by Israeli commandos. 
  Israel hopes al-Dirani can supply vital information on 
missing Israeli airman Ron Arad shot down in south Lebanon in 
1986.

  [Excerpts] Ba'labakk, Lebanon, June 9 (AFP) -- Pro-Iranian 
Hizballah guerrillas released six Lebanese men and a retired 
Syrian soldier hours after kidnapping them in Syrian-controlled 
eastern Lebanon, Syrian military officials said Thursday. 
  They were freed overnight Wednesday after the Syrian 
military 
command in the al-Biqa' Valley threatened to arrest Hizballah 
militants in retaliation, the officials said. 
  The men were seized in the Ba'labakk region after three of 
them were seen taking photographs outside the home of 
Hizballah's former secretary general Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli. 
  Two of the men were identified as Lebanese expatriates who 
had returned to their home villages after long stays in the Gulf 
state of Qatar and the United States. [passage omitted] 
  Moslem fundamentalist leaders have charged that the 
commandos 
were assisted by local accomplices. 
  Hizballah has been on alert since June 2 when Israeli 
warplanes killed 32 guerrilla trainees on a base near Ba'labakk.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Allamah Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah by Rif'at </F>
Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut's Southern Suburb; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Ahmad: The Arab and Islamic situation 
is now experiencing changes and events, especially in light of 
developments in the Arab-Zionist conflict. What is your general 
assessment of this situation in light of these changes? 
  Fadlallah: [passage omitted] We notice that the 
jihad operations carried out by Islamist Palestinians have 
attracted much attention from U.S. officials to the extent that 
they deal with 'Arafat based on his rejection of these 
operations. They want 'Arafat's rejection to be expressed in 
harsh words and strong denunciation, not just regret, when the 
United States is satisfied with just expressing regret for all 
massacres of Muslims committed by the Jews. [passage omitted] 
  Monitoring the future, we have to see economic matters in 
their strategic perspective; whereas security-wise, we have to 
view the future in light of the confrontation with the Islamic 
inclination or the difficult conflicts involving native or 
national movements that reality generates. 
  We also have to monitor the new plan America might work out 
by encircling the Islamic Republic of Iran through a Middle East 
steered by the American strategy that is open to other 
strategies in the region. 
  Ahmad: Are we content with the role of bystander 
or do you have a specific vision of this confrontation? 
  Fadlallah: We talk about monitoring because we are 
trying to analyze reality and future prospects. But in the 
meantime, we are not neutral regarding that reality. As 
Islamists, we seek to revive the Islamic inclination by all 
means possible. We have our own rational and diligent study 
that measures reality against objectives to distort that 
American-Israeli plan. As Islamists, we proceed on the basis of 
integration with pan-Arabists, that is if they are determined to 
free the Arab political, security, and economic aspects from the 
American fist and if they have not already sunk in the dreams 
America is trying to make them live by using words like 
moderation and so on. 
  I believe that we have to relate with nationalists, 
pan-Arabists, and even with the Marxists who adopt a creed 
different from ours. [passage omitted] 
  Ahmad: A final word by Your Eminence to your 
readers in Egypt. 
  Fadlallah: As I speak about the great Islamic 
homeland in Egypt, I tell all our kinsfolk, brothers, and fellow 
citizens that they should preserve Egypt as a strength for 
Arabs, Muslims, and Africa and as a source of strength for 
anyone who seeks freedom and justice. 
  We believe that the Egyptian nation is one of the best and 
most honest, open and loving nations. We do not count on the 
regime--any regime--to stand against this intelligence game but 
believe that, with its Islamic awareness, Christian openness, 
and originality, the Egyptian nation will foil this intelligence 
game. 
  We want to say to the Egyptians--the regime and people--that 
the regime will not benefit from this kind of bloodshed, neither 
now nor in the future because the international ploy does not 
want this nation to be stable. God has urged us to argue our 
cases in an amicable way, to promote the cause of God with 
wisdom and friendly advice, to act with goodness to turn our 
enemies into friends, to be patient over our differences and 
problems to know how to reconcile our differences and solve our 
problems. 
  We are sad, very sad, about what is happening in Egypt and 
do 
not believe that the Islamists mean harm to Egypt or to its 
people. Perhaps some people differ with them over certain 
methods and concepts but we can only say that they are loyal to 
the Egyptian people and the Islamic cause. We remind the 
Egyptians of what Imam 'Ali said about the renegades and we do 
not want to talk about the Islamists as renegades or talk about 
the regime this way. We are not in the habit of characterizing 
people but we seek the idea: "Do not fight the renegades for 
their mistakes because anyone who seeks right and errs is not 
like one who seeks and does what is wrong." 
  If you claim that the Islamists are wrong--indeed, some of 
them use the wrong methods for rightful ends--try to initiate a 
broad and the best kind of dialogue to caution them about what 
is wrong if there is anything and in this case their Islamic 
origins will lead them to retreat from the wrong if they are 
convinced. Those who believe that the state's engagement in 
dialogue means a loss of prestige for the state are mistaken, 
because the state's prestige is commensurate with the protection 
it offers to its people and its persuading them to integrate 
with it. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Jad al-Akhawi dispatch from Jba', southern Lebanon] </F>
  [Excerpts] Here in the town of Jba' in Iqlim al-Tuffah the 
inhabitants are cautious. From time to time they hear the 
sounds of bombs or of Israeli reconnaissance planes, which 
usually precede air raids. This is when they rush to shelters 
and safe rooms. [passage omitted] 
  It has been learned that Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq 
al-Hariri and Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah have 
held a telephone conversation in which the need for containing 
the situation and depriving Israel of any pretexts to perpetrate 
new acts of aggression was stressed. It was also learned that 
similar contacts were held between Syrian officials and the 
Hizballah leadership. 
  But, according to fundamentalist sources, the resistance 
will 
continue its operations and a response to the raid near 
Ba'labakk last week must be expected. The sources said the 
visit to Lebanon by Iranian envoy Kazem Khonsari and his 
meetings with Lebanese officials and with resistance leaders 
came as support for the resistance, not to ask it to calm the 
situation and refrain from reacting, as the Lebanese papers 
reported today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah </F>
by Dr. Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad in Beirut--date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Ahmad: Hizballah's name has been 
associated with martyrdom. How would you describe Hizballah's 
experiment in the past decade through its resistance operations 
in the south and its association with the notion of martyrdom? 
  Nasrallah: From the start, Hizballah was 
established as a jihad movement, and it operated on this basis. 
[passage omitted on difficult circumstances during Hizballah's 
inception] We believe that this jihad movement, which is still 
continuing, could develop further and could be generalized, and 
this is what we are looking forward to. We want to see this 
resistance in all the cordon states around the Zionist enemy. 
  Ahmad: With the liberation of all the Lebanese 
soil, will the suicidal performance of the Islamic movement in 
the south be affected or will it continue in various forms until 
Palestine and Jerusalem are liberated? 
  Nasrallah: In fact this question has been the 
focus of interest in many circles. One thing is clear in all 
cases. When the Israeli enemy withdraws from the Lebanese 
territories, the resistance will stop at that level. As for the 
rest of the question and the types of action, this is premature; 
the matter will be subject to developments and the situations 
that might arise. As far as principles are concerned, we 
believe that Palestine is an occupied land, that Israel is a 
usurper entity, and that the Palestinians are primarily 
responsible for liberating this land. They are entitled to 
support from all Arab and Muslim nations until all the land is 
liberated. As for how and through which methods, this will be 
determined in time. [passage omitted on condemnation of regional 
peace talks with Israel and domestic situation in Lebanon] 
  Ahmad: This takes us to the parliamentary 
experience and your assessment of it. Some Islamic movements in 
other countries reject the idea of the parliamentary experience 
for several reasons, including reasons that have to do with 
jurisprudence. What is your assessment of this experience in 
terms of jurisprudence, as well as actually and politically in 
Lebanon, particularly after Hizballah's entry into the 
parliament and its becoming the biggest partisan power in the 
parliament? 
  Nasrallah: [passage omitted on unique conditions 
in each Islamic country] We now come to the parliamentary 
experience. When we entered the parliamentary battle, we had a 
set of objectives and goals. We wanted to have a voice in the 
parliament to call for resistance. Our priorities in Lebanon 
are different from other Islamic movements elsewhere. Some 
Islamic movements give priority to overthrowing the regime and 
establishing an Islamic state. Accordingly, they move in that 
direction. We believe that our top and dominant priority is to 
fight Israel, expel the Israeli occupier, and arouse the nation 
to establish a major popular, Islamic resistance that restores 
Jerusalem and rids the nation of that cancerous growth. Hence, 
we are primarily concerned with enhancing efforts in the 
direction of that priority at all the political and legal 
levels. This requires being within an institution that is 
capable of providing some kind of support to the resistance 
movement. Therefore, we endeavored to support the resistance 
after entering the parliament. In that context, we developed 
other objectives, like defending the victims of injustice from 
within the parliament and providing better conditions for our 
people through submitting bills and discussing government plans 
and budget. [passage omitted on Lebanese people's respect for 
Hizballah]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Libya/Italy: Libyan Proposal for </F>
Lockerbie Trial"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 8 -- Libya wants a trial at the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague for two of its 
citizens accused of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, Libya's 
ambassador to Rome 'Abd-al-Rahman Shalqam told Lower House 
foreign affairs committee chief Mirko Tremaglia on Wednesday [8 
June]. 
  Libyan authorities will suggest that an all-Scottish jury be 
created for the trial of the two, wanted in Scotland and the 
United States on charges of having planned the bombing. 
  Two hundred and seventy people died when a Pan Am jet 
exploded in flight over the Scottish town of Lockerbie on 
December 21 1988. 
  According to Tremaglia, the Libyan government will send the 
Italian authorities "a written statement on their decision, 
which is aimed at finding a definitive resolution for the issue." 
  The Libyan ambassador argued that such a step would meet 
demands of successive United Nations resolutions on the 
question, Tremaglia said.

<F P=106> [Interview with 'Umar al-Muntasir, secretary of the Libyan </F>
General People's Committee for External Liaison and 
International Cooperation (foreign minister), by Sawsan 
Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given] 
  [Excerpts] Abu-Husayn: Do you believe there are 
on the horizon encouraging signs of a peaceful solution to the 
Lockerbie crisis? 
  Al-Muntasir: The Lockerbie crisis will be 
resolved peacefully. There is no alternative. It is difficult 
to set a date for that now. But we are seeking to achieve it as 
soon as possible. What remains now is to agree on the 
foundations for a solution with the Western parties within the 
framework of some points proposed by the Arab League. I spoke 
with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid on 
the sidelines of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] conference and 
agreed that the seven-member committee should convene after the 
African summit scheduled to be held in Tunis within days. We 
will discuss the two resolutions adopted by the NAM and the 
African conference and ways of implementing them, especially as 
NAM ministers welcomed Libya's acceptance of Security Council 
Resolution 731 and stressed the need for the parties concerned 
to secure a just settlement that safeguards all interests in 
accordance with international law and the principles of the UN 
Charter. Furthermore, the international community and its 
organizations are showing solidarity with us vis-a-vis the 
negative results caused by the embargo imposed on the country. 
This is why there is an inclination to urge the Security 
Council to take account of the Arab League's new proposal. 
  Abu-Husayn: On what basis are the Western parties 
responding to a peaceful solution with Libya? 
  Al-Muntasir: There is a Western inclination to 
ignore a peaceful solution with Libya, especially as its 
moderate policy no longer threatens world security and peace. 
It is always trying to find a just way out that meets 
commitment to international laws. Best proof of this is Libya's 
full withdrawal from the Aozou strip [Chad], even though this is 
not in Libya's interests. That is, we lost the legal case but 
preferred to fully respect the court's decision, while we see 
the major states advocating international legitimacy and yet 
they refuse to comply with it in numerous cases. [passage 
omitted] 
  Abu-Husayn: What about the Security Council? 
Will it take account of this commitment by Libya and thus allow 
the gradual lifting of the embargo imposed on your country, 
especially as it allowed UN observers to use planes to travel to 
the Aozou strip? 
  Al-Muntasir: That step is regarded as a good 
precedent in the United Nations, and we hope it will be a good 
gesture and a good start for further steps toward lifting the 
embargo on Libya. I personally am optimistic in this connection.

  [Text] Visual and audio media have addressed an appeal to 
Aden District people warning that the gang of crime and treason 
has distributed booby-trapped pens, toys, and watches to blow 
them up. The appeal called on them not to pick up any of these 
items wherever they may be found. The following is the text of 
the appeal: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The one 
who betrays his country cannot appreciate others because he 
lacks all feelings of citizenship in both heart and mind. 
Likewise, the one who plots to fragment his country will not 
hesitate to send all the sons of the country to the crematorium 
of death and annihilation. Every criminal who commits such 
crimes will not hesitate to perpetrate the ugliest of crimes 
toward others, be they men, women, youths, elderly, or children. 
Thus, the mania of crime and grudge led traitor agent 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid, the initiator of war and killer of children and 
women, to cherish the idea of killing children with trickery and 
cheap games in a bid to distort the citizens' feelings toward 
the future of the homeland. As for their present, unity has 
triumphed to the point of no return. The immortal existence of 
unity has been baptized for ever by the sacrifices of the brave 
heroes of the Armed and Security Forces. Otherwise, what is the 
meaning of criminal al-Bid's distribution of booby-trapped pens, 
toys, and watches in Aden streets and suburbs so that children 
can pick them up and get blown up under the claim that the one 
who distributed them and dropped them from planes are the forces 
of unity and legitimacy? They will then portray those 
victimized children to the world public as victims of the 
missiles which they falsely claim the forces of unity and 
protection of legitimacy are using to shell the city suburbs. 
It is easy to tell such lies and make such fabrications before 
us and the world. They are cheap lies about an ugly crime of 
killing children in such a vile and cowardly manner. 
  While revealing this bitter fact about the latest innovation 
of the criminal secessionists, we appeal to fathers and mothers 
and all citizens in the suburbs of the city of Aden--in 
(Kiraytar), al-Mu'alla, al-Tawwahi, (Hawr Makthar), al-Shaykh 
'Uthman, al-Qallu'ah, al-Burayqah, al-Mansurah, al-Sha'b city, 
and other suburbs--to prevent children from picking up any pens, 
watches, toys, or housewares from the streets in front of their 
houses so that their lives will be saved and no distortions be 
sustained. 
  As for the criminal secessionist butchers, they will sooner 
or later receive their punishment. Our people will never be 
deceived by all their criminal methods and vile, treacherous 
actions. Tomorrow is close at hand for all to see.

<F P=106> [Anatoliy Stasovskiy report under the "Events and </F>
Commentaries" rubric: "Fifth Victim: Is the Opposition in 
Tajikistan Switching to Terror?"] 
  [Text] Alarming and tragic reports continue to come in from 
Tajikistan. Another two servicemen died on the evening of 1 
June. Private Vladislav Maksakov, who was in charge of a border 
detail, was blown up by a mine laid by gunmen in the 9th Border 
Troop Subunit's section. And in Dushanbe, Lieutenant Colonel 
Yuriy Shkipkin, deputy chief of a Tajik Defense Ministry troop 
service, was killed not far from his home. 
  The investigative commissions of the Russian Border Troops 
and the Tajik law-enforcement agencies hardly have time to get 
to the bottom of one tragedy before another occurs. You cannot 
help noticing that attacks on the military have started to occur 
most frequently in the rear services and as a result of 
terrorist and sabotage acts. According to statements by the 
Tajik law-enforcement agencies, the murders of both Lt. Col. 
Vladimir Borisenkov of the Russian Border Troops (31 May) and 
Lt. Col. Yuriy Shkipkin from the republic's Defense Ministry are 
criminal offenses. And yet it may be supposed with a high 
degree of probability that gunmen are implicated here. The 
opposition has chosen new tactics for waging the struggle. 
Since the failure of several operations actually on the border 
and substantial losses of mojahedin they have switched to 
sabotage and terror. It is perfectly possible that the current 
stepping up of terrorist activity has been prompted by the 
successful Russian Border Troop operation carried out in the 
section covered by the 8th Border Troop Subunit of the Pyandzh 
border detachment (31 May-1 June) to "squeeze" gunmen out of the 
Naychi peninsula: Several dozen mojahedin were forced to take 
to their heels to save themselves after successful joint actions 
by border troops and servicemen of the Russian 201st Division. 
  Five members of the border troops have fallen victim to 
terrorism already this year. Aware that they are losing support 
even among sympathetic strata of the population, the gunmen are 
acting with special savagery, deviousness, and baseness. But by 
no means all manage to get away scot-free. According to the 
latest ITAR-TASS report, thanks to operational actions carried 
out by investigations and law-enforcement agencies, an 
inhabitant of Tajikistan was arrested 1 June on suspicion of 
murdering Lt. Col. Borisenkov.

<F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Several hours ago, a terrorist act was perpetrated 
in Moscow. Our correspondent D. Matyushin has just returned 
from the location. 
  Matyushin: There was a powerful explosion this 
afternoon at about 0500 hours, near Paveletskiy railway station, 
alongside the famous Logovaz company. Eyewitnesses stated that 
as Logovaz General Director Boris Berezovskiy was driving his 
car out of the gates, a nearby car stuffed with explosives blew 
up. The driver was killed and the director general's bodyguard 
was badly wounded. Boris Berezovskiy himself received burns to 
his face. He was in a state of shock and was taken to the 
hospital. A driver who was passing by at the time of the 
explosion was also hurt. The exploded empty car had Lithuanian 
license plates and a remote control device had been placed in 
it. According to Yuriy Kolpakov, head of the department of city 
procuracy, it was a planned attempt on the life of the director 
of Logovaz. 
  In Moscow alone in the past six months there have been 10 
such assassination attempts. [Video shows badly damaged car,

<F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Zheludkov: "Weekend Explosions in </F>
Central Moscow"] 
  [Text] Explosions are becoming increasingly common in the 
capital, which will not please Moscow Criminal Investigation 
Department No. 6, which investigates these crimes. The two 
latest "firework displays" took place in central Moscow, not far 
from IZVESTIYA. 
  Both explosions occurred at night, which, according to the 
experts, rules out the possibility of an attempted killing. 
More than likely, specialists from the Main Internal Affairs 
Administration say, they were warnings or attempts to 
intimidate. At the Main Internal Affairs Administration press 
center information was extremely thin on the ground, as ever: 
The first explosion took place in the early hours of Saturday 
in the branch of the "Stolichnyy" bank that is being constructed 
at 22/2 Chekhov Street: An explosive device of an unknown type 
went off at 0245 hours. Three windows were shattered, but there 
no casualties. 
  At 0125 hours on the next night, not far away, near 30/2 
Tverskaya Street, a Mercedes 230 car exploded. The bomb, of an 
unknown type, probably homemade, exploded under the rear right 
wheel of the Mercedes and the car was turned over by the blast 
onto the car next to it. The privately registered 6-series 
Zhiguli was burned out as a result. All that is known about the 
owner of the Mercedes is that he is 30, he does not work 
anywhere, and he lives on Bolotnikovskaya Street in Moscow. 
  According to the established practice, there will be a long 
search for the bombers, with special crime investigation centers 
being set up at the Moscow militia's 108th and 64th stations. 
For the time being Muscovites living in the center can only 
pray at night or go to their dachas for the weekend.

<F P=106> [Peter Scherer report: "Turks Control Heroin Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Wiesbaden -- Members of extremist organizations 
banned in Germany are suspected of not only being involved in 
the political underground in Germany, but also in international 
heroin deals, Klaus Juergen Timm, chief of the Criminal Office 
of the land of Hesse, told DIE WELT. Members of the Turkish 
right-wing extremist organization Green Wolves and of the 
militant Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] have been identified in 
this connection. 
  Turkish nationals are unquestioned market leaders in heroin 
dealings. The dealers who are linked mainly to Turkish-Kurdish 
drug organizations have also expanded their domination. 
According to the Criminal Office of Hesse, in 1993 Turks 
already formed 32.3 percent of all those suspected of being 
involved in the organized drug trade and drug smuggling. 
  Timm is convinced that "conspiratorial PKK command and 
communications structures" continue to exist even though they 
have been outlawed. Internationally coordinated activities are 
still possible. "The PKK must be considered an organization 
that is not only responsible for massive violent activity on 
German soil, but also deals harshly with its own people who 
break the rules, and does not shy from assassination," says 
Timm. "There is also evidence that the PKK is collecting money 
from Kurds living in Germany, and in large quantities. Whoever 
fails to donate willingly is compelled to donate, even with the 
use of force." 
  In addition, the PKK is being investigated for blackmail. 
Timm: "The problem is that we do not have witnesses who could 
confirm the criminal nature of the money-gathering activity. 
This is because the PKK places witnesses under pressure and is 
not afraid to use violence. One cannot normally investigate 
illegal financial dealings on the basis of acquired receipts 
alone."

  [Excerpts] Wiesbaden/Bonn -- Nearly one year after the 
unsuccessful antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, Interior 
Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) has 
initiated the announced restructuring of the Federal Office of 
Criminal Investigation [BKA]. [passage omitted] 
  BKA department head Manfred Klink will be responsible for 
the 
Terrorism and Protection of the State Main Department, which 
will be based in Meckenheim near Bonn in the future. 
  Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection 
among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy 
that is to be introduced between the BKA president, the vice 
president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with 
all modern findings concerning control and organization, the 
chairman of the GdP group in the BKA, Arno Falk, stressed. The 
appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong 
consequence from Bad Kleinen." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Greece's most subdued pre-election period in living 
memory took a bloody twist on Friday night, when a man 
concealing a knife in a bouquet of flowers stabbed three Greek 
Communist Party [KKE) candidates for next Sunday's 
Europarliament elections. 
  Right at the end of a party rally in the centre of 
Thessaloniki, the attacker had approached the speakers' stand 
and suddenly pulled out the 12-inch (30 cm) knife. 
  Eurodeputy Vasilios Efraimidhis, Greek General Confederation 
of Labor (YSEE) secretary Ioannis Theonas and KKE Central 
Committee member Mikhail Spiridhakis were rushed to the nearby 
AHEPA [American-Hellenic Educational and Progressive 
Association] hospital, with deep stab wounds in their hips and 
thighs. 
  The assailant was later identified as Manolis Theodhorakis, 
54, a Greek emigrant worker who had recently returned from 
Germany, and his suspected accomplice, ironsmith Evangelos 
Radhos, 26. Immediately after the attack, outraged supporters 
beat Theodhorakis who is now in critical condition in hospital. 
  All parties condemned the attack and demanded a full 
investigation, the apparent motive for the brutal attack still 
unknown.

<F P=106> [Interview with Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring by </F>
Veronique Meutey; place and date not given: "Northern Ireland: 
Voting for Peace" -- first two paragraphs are LE FIGARO 
introduction] 
  [Text] The European election which takes place today in 
both Northern Ireland and Britain will be dominated by the 
conflict that has been racking the province for 25 years. 
Candidates fielded by three major parties are expected to be 
reelected: Ian Paisley for the Democratic Ulster Party (DUP), 
Jim Nicholson for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP, moderate), and 
John Hume, a Catholic, for the Social Democratic Labor Party 
(SDLP, moderately nationalist). 
  "European stakes transcend our traditional fault lines. If 
we can cooperate with other European countries in view of a 
common interest, then we can work together at home," John Hume 
pleaded, to no avail. Once again, political and religious 
differences will prevail. And both the SDLP, which has been 
defending the Anglo-Irish document, and the UUP, which still 
favors it, fear the disenchantment of moderate voters with the 
slowness of the peace process. In this context, Irish Foreign 
Minister Dick Spring explains Dublin's views on the European 
election's immediate stakes as well as the conditions for a 
potential referendum on Irish reunification. [passage omitted] 
  Meutey: How can the conflict in Northern Ireland 
be ended? 
  Spring: Right now, the best way would be for the 
Loyalists and Republicans to seize the chance offered them by 
the Downing Street declaration and subsequent texts. If they 
acknowledge these texts, they agree to support negotiation 
efforts between London and Dublin. 
  Meutey: Do you favor reunification? 
  Spring: All we want today is to put an end to the 
killing in Ulster. For the time being, reunification is not on 
the agenda. We must show respect for the Loyalists, who want to 
retain their links with Britain. The identity of the 500,000 
individuals who want to retain their connections with the Irish 
Republic must be respected as well. 
  Meutey: When would reunification actually happen, 
then? 
  Spring: When a majority of Ulster's population 
has expressed a wish to see it happen... 
  Meutey: If Sinn Fein agrees to stop the violence, 
when would the referendum take place in Northern Ireland? 
  Spring: Even if violence were to stop tomorrow 
morning, at least 12 months of talks would be needed. So the 
referendum could be held in both Northern and Southern Ireland 
within a year. 
  Meutey: Will voters in Northern Ireland be asked 
the same question as in your country? 
  Spring: Ideally, yes. But we must take into 
account differences between the two countries. There will 
likely have to be two different questions. 
  Meutey: Will the referendums be held on the same 
day? 
  Spring: Same day, same time...

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Grenade Found in Rome Park"] </F>
  [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 6 -- A SRCM-type [Rome Company for 
Mechanical Products] hand grenade was spotted in Rome's Villa 
Borghese park Monday afternoon [6 June] by a passerby who 
alerted police. Explosives experts were called in and detonated 
the grenade without mishap. 
  The condition of the grenade and the fact that it was 
partially covered with dirt led police to believe that it had 
been placed at the site -- alongside the viale del Museo, one of 
the many roads that wend through the vast park -- some days ago, 
in turn, leading to an initial theory that, perhaps, it was 
linked to the recent Rome sojourn of United States President 
Bill Clinton. 
  Investigators later ruled this out, however, as Clinton 
entered Villa Borghese from an entrance near the zoo which is 
more than 500 meters from where the SRCM was found, a type of 
grenade which can cause damage only if launched from close 
quarters, explosive experts said. 
  Laboratory tests will establish the explosive power of the 
grenade and how long it was on the ground. 
  Investigators said it was highly unlikely that it was there 
during Clinton's visit as security was extremely tight and 
careful checks were made of Villa Borghese each time the 
American president went there to jog. (Clinton left Rome on 
Saturday morning [4 June]). 
  SRCM (Societa' Romana Costruzioni Meccaniche) grenades 
cannot 
be modified, explosive experts noted. It was this same kind of 
grenade that killed a policeman during a right-wing 
demonstration in Milan in April of 1973. The grenade had struck 
officer Antonio Marino full in the chest. 
  Similar grenades were found in April and May, both in Rome 
and in Milan. However, the grenade in Milan was found to be a 
wooden model of the type used in military training. It came to 
light just before the sentence was handed down in the lengthy 
Cusani kickbacks trial in Milan. In Rome, the explosive was 
found near the Villa Glori police station in the somewhat posh 
Parioli quarter.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Terrorist Police Investigate </F>
Three Foreigners"] 
  [Text] (ANSA) Caserta, Italy, June 5 -- Local and national 
special branch anti-terrorist police are working with 
international investigators in an attempt to determine the real 
identities of three foreign nationals detained here, in this 
city in the Naples hinterland, and the reason for their arrival 
in Italy. 
  It was learned at the weekend the three were arrested in a 
small villa on the coast north of Naples in November or December 
last year and found in possession of counterfeit documents, ten 
passports which had been stolen in the United States and address 
books packed with the names and telephone numbers of people 
resident throughout the Middle East. 
  The suspects were named as Echen Oyechei, 22, from Nigeria, 
Barle Binda Brown, 32, who claims to come from the United 
States, and Yvette Perbach, 21, from former East Germany. 
Policemen from Castel Volturno, on the southern Tyrrhenian 
north of Naples, took the trio into custody in a villa rented in 
the names of foreign nationals, including that of Echen Oyechei. 
Many of the residents of the area are members of the military 
attached to the nearby NATO base and their families. 
  Also turned up during a search of the small villa, it was 
learned at the weekend, were notes written in coded Arabic, 
credit cards and other documents in the name of Italian 
journalist and writer Roberto Gervasi and newspaper clippings of 
reports of bombings, terrorist acts and protest demonstrations 
which had occurred in the Israeli- occupied Arab territories, 
especially Gaza. 
  Also found were maps of the centers of cities and towns on 
the southern Tyrrhenian around Naples and photographs of Castel 
Volturno law enforcement personnel and notes on their movements 
in patrolling the area. 
  Oyechei declared himself a political prisoner at the time of 
his arrest and, later, claimed that he was working for Israeli 
intelligence on a search for a Palestinian terrorist, said the 
U.S. FBI was looking for him and threatened suicide if he were 
turned over to U.S. authorities. 
  The woman who identified herself as Barle Binda Brown 
reportedly was found to speak English with a Ukrainian accent 
when she was questioned in what she claimed was her native 
language. Shortly before her arrest, she and the other woman 
taken into custody arrived in Italy together on a flight from 
Istanbul. 
  As investigations into the three were pursued, the Caserta 
police chief, Luciano Rosini, ordered tighter surveillance and 
checks of the area ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized 
nations summit in Naples, on the calendar for early next month.

arrests] 
  [Text] Four people were arrested this morning in the Basque 
province of Guipuzcoa for their suspected links to ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty]. In France, a further 10 people were 
arrested; they are linked to ETA's network of people taking in 
terrorists. 
  A further 13 people had already been arrested. Four of them 
are suspected of belonging to ETA's (Kiruli) Commandos, and they 
are accused of murdering a Civil Guard in September, 1993 in 
Andoain, and of killing an employee of a Telefonica subsidiary 
they had mistaken for a policeman. 
  According to Jose Maria Gurruchaga Zapirain, the civil 
governor of Guipuzcoa, four ETA commandos used the arsenal found 
yesterday in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil. 
  He then went on to describe the operation as a big blow for 
ETA, because some of those arrested had been long-standing ETA 
members.

  [Text] In the last few hours the Civil Guard has arrested 
13 people in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa for their 
suspected links with ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]. This 
police operation also led to the discovery of a large arsenal of 
arms and explosives. Jesus Mari Esteban reports from San 
Sebastian: 
  Esteban: Good morning. This past weekend, in 
Guipuzcoa, members of the 513 Civil Guard Command arrested 13 
people suspected of links with the ETA terrorist band. 
According to a note just released by the office of the civil 
governor of Guipuzcoa, as a result of these arrests a large arms 
and explosives arsenal has been found, apparently belonging to 
ETA's San Sebastian commando unit. The arms store was discovered 
in the Guipuzcoa town of Usurbil, concealed in the home of a 
collaborator of the ETA unit. The arsenal comprises 40 
kilograms of explosives, several rifles, pistols, shotguns, 
grenades and other materiel. The first arrests were made during 
Saturday night, in Usurbil and Orio; seven more people were 
arrested in the early hours of this morning in Usurbil, Lasarte 
and Oyarzun.

  [Text] Ankara--A series of mystery murders in the past week 
have prompted allegations that some State forces in Turkey are 
linked to a systematic campaign to intimidate pro-Kurdish 
businessmen and politicians. On Saturday a group of fishermen 
discovered the bodies of pro-Kurdish businessman Savas Buldan 
and two of his colleagues, Haci Koray and Adnan Yildirim near 
the Melen river in the Yigilca township of Bolu province. The 
three had been shot in the back of the head. Police sources 
said the three had also been tortured and were without 
identification papers when found. Relatives identified the 
bodies which were brought to Istanbul on Sunday. 
  Buldan was a wealthy Istanbul businessman who is in the 
hotel 
and restaurant business. He comes from the township of 
Yuksekova in the southeastern province of Hakkari. His 
colleagues Koray was also from Yuksekova while Yildirim came 
from the township of Lice in Diyarbakir province. Buldan's 
brother Necdet Buldan is the former mayor of Yuksekova and 
belongs to the pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP). The killings 
follow the killing of Muhsin Melik and his driver in the 
southeastern provincial center of Urfa by four or five 
unidentified persons. Melik is the founder of the People's 
Democrat Party (HADEP), a new pro-Kurdish party set up to 
eventually replace DEP. Melik was the former provincial chairman 
of DEP. 
  Before his death Melik reportedly told his brother that he 
had been shot by plainclothes policemen just outside his office. 
Melik allegedly shot and wounded one of his assailants. The 
governor of Urfa said two persons were in custody related to the 
murder. 
  Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into 
custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. 
The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police 
identification cards and then took them away in unmarked cars, 
according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who witnessed the 
incident. 
  The death of Buldan was the latest in a chain of murders 
committed against persons who allegedly have links with Kurdish 
separatist militants. The first case concerned pro-Kurdish 
underground figure Behcet Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu 
who were found murdered near the Sapanca section of the 
Istanbul-Ankara highway. Canturk was also from the Lice 
township. 
  Later the body of Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci was 
found near Ankara's Golbasi district in February. He had been 
killed by seven bullets. 
  In March another prominent figure from Lice, contractor 
Fevzi 
Arslan, and his brother Sahin were kidnapped at gun point in 
their Aksaray office in Istanbul and their bodies were later 
found on the Istanbul-Ankara highway. 
  Buldan was previously taken into custody in 1992 when police 
raided his house in Istanbul and discovered he was hosting DEP 
Diyarbakir Deputy Leyla Zana, her husband Megdi Zana and seven 
other people who were allegedly linked to the outlawed Kurdistan 
Workers' Party (PKK). There were claims that Buldan had 
provided PKK with guns and financial aid. He was later 
released. Conservative Turkish papers claimed Buldan may have 
been killed by the mafia because of drug trafficking. 
  Pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Ulke, however, pointed the finger at 
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and said the prime minister had 
warned on November 4, 1993 that the government has information 
about businessmen and other personalities who give extortion 
money to the PKK and had threatened to "make them pay." The 
paper claimed Ciller was now making the businessmen "pay." 
Ozgur Ulke quoted former National Intelligence Organization 
(MIT) member Professor Mahir Kaynak as saying "the murders were 
planned by those who had provided the list of pro-Kurdish 
businessmen to the prime minister." Kaynak also said the 
murders were being planned and carried out by those in the State 
cadres who do not want a political solution to the Kurdish 
problem. The Turkish Daily News learnt that at first police had 
confirmed Bulan and his friends had been taken into custody but 
later denied this. The Bulan family members reportedly had some 
sources inside the police and they alleged that they were told 
"do not follow up your complaints." 
  Buldan's brother contacted Deputy Prime Minister Murat 
Karayalcin who allegedly told him "this matter is way above my 
head." Meanwhile, in Ankara DEP officials charged also that 
Muhsin Melik was killed by police in Urfa. DEP Acting Chairman 
Remzi Kartal said the police were at the scene of the incident 
only two minutes after Melik was shot. Melik was then wounded 
and refused to get into the police car saying "you are the 
people who shot me." 
  Kartal said eye witnesses identified the license plate of 
the 
car used in the murder of Melik as 06 ED 246. It was a white 
Renault Broadway. He claimed a similar car was seen being 
driven into the Urfa police headquarters the same day carrying a 
wounded person. Kartal claimed "those who oppose state policies 
are either silenced or eliminated."

  [Excerpts] Ankara--The Democracy Party (DEP) and People's 
Democracy Party (HADEP) have condemned the killings of three 
pro-Kurdish businessmen Savas Buldan, Haci Koray and Adnan 
Yildirim. [passage omitted] 
  "This is not an isolated incident. It is just a link in the 
chain which started with the death of Vedat Aydin and continued 
with the killing of Muhsin Melik, the founder of the People's 
Democracy Party," HADEP Chairman Murat Bozlak said Monday. "The 
government is under an obligation to find the murderers, 
especially since it was reported to officials that the three men 
had gone missing," he added. "The state is under suspicion 
until it finds those responsible." 
  Buldan and his two companions were allegedly taken into 
custody by a group of policemen outside Istanbul's Cinar Hotel. 
The persons who apprehended them reportedly showed their police 
identification cards and then took the three men away in 
unmarked cars, according to the personnel of the Cinar Hotel who 
witnessed the incident. 
  DEP Acting Chairman Remzi Kartal, meanwhile, appealed to 
President Suleyman Demirel "to find those who are responsible 
for the killings." 
  "The government, the Parliament and the media are 
insensitive. We do not have anywhere to turn," Kartal said.

  [Text] The attacks on Kurdish businessmen began when they 
were targeted in a statement by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller at 
the Holiday Inn Hotel in Istanbul on 4 November 1993. 
  During her news conference at the Holiday Inn Hotel, Ciller 
said: "Turkey is facing an expanding terrorist movement that has 
assumed the nature of a militia movement. We know the names of 
the businessmen and artists from whom PKK [Kurdish Workers 
Party] levies money. We will call them to account." 
  Behcet Canturk, a Kurdish businessman from Lice, became the 
first victim following Ciller's statement targeting Kurdish 
businessmen. Two days after being abducted in Istanbul on 15 
January 1994, Canturk and his driver Recep Kuzucu were found 
dead in Sapanca district of Adapazari. 
  After Canturk's murder, Fevzi Aslan and his nephew Salih 
Aslan, both businessmen from Lice, were abducted while visiting 
a friend at Tokgoz Otomotiv firm in Istanbul's Sehremini 
district by armed persons claiming to be policemen. Two days 
later, Fevzi and Salih Aslan were found dead in Sapanca. 
  In statements made after these incidents, police officials 
said that the same gun was used in the murders. 
  Following these counter-guerrilla attacks in Istanbul, Mecit 
Baskin, who is from Yuksekova and who was the director of births 
registry in Ankara's Altindag district and a relative of Savas 
Buldan [another murdered Kurdish businessmen], was found 
murdered near the beltway two days after being abducted. After 
the murder of Baskin, Behcet Canturk's lawyer Yusuf Ziya Ekinci 
was abducted in Ankara. Two days later he was found dead near 
Ankara's beltway. 
  Also, Namik Erdogan, a Kurd from Hakkari who was deputy 
chief 
of the inspection department at the Health Ministry, was 
abducted and murdered last month. Erdogan's body was found by a 
fountain near Kiliclar on the Kirikkale-Ankara highway.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; see "Selected Video </F>
Reports" section for information on ordering video tape] 
  [Text] Five members of the Islamic Action organization 
have been captured in Izmir with large quantities of weapons, 
ammunitions, explosives, and organizational documents in their 
possession. The suspects, one of them a woman, abducted a 
foreign girl in Izmir and released her after receiving the 
ransom money. 
  According to information received by the Izmir Security 
Directorate, the suspects asked for 205,000 German marks in 
return for the girl they had abducted in Bornova. Considering 
the girl's life first, the security forces advised the family to 
pay the ransom money. After a series of operations and by 
taking the necessary measures before and after the exchange, the 
security forces captured the suspects at their meeting place. 
  The suspects confessed to abducting the girl in order to 
raise money for the organization and to having undergone 
training in the use of explosives, perpetrating sabotage, and 
terrorist actions in camps located in a neighboring country. 
The suspects also explained that they had participated in a 
series of actions in the past to gain practice. 
  The suspects also confessed that they were preparing actions 
against prominent businessmen in the Turkish economy and were in 
the process of conducting a preparatory study of 100 businessmen 
in Izmir. It was determined that the suspects used luxurious 
villas and flats as the organization's cell houses and lived a 
very good life. 
  In searches conducted in their cells; three automatic 
rifles, 
one of them a Kalashnikov; five revolvers of various calibers 
and makes, one of them used for assassinations; and rounds of 
ammunition for the revolvers were seized. In addition, 
electronics used in manufacturing bombs, 13 transmitters used in 
manufacturing bombs, photoelectric cells, nine time bombs ready 
to be set off and equipment used in their manufacturing, booby 
traps to be placed in fake books and explode when the cover is 
opened, defensive fragmentation grenades, large quantities of 
chemicals used in manufacturing explosives, and organizational 
documents were seized. 
  Izmir Security Directorate officials stated that the 
uniqueness and the very diverse capabilities and sensitivities 
of the explosive systems were similar to those used in several 
unsolved murders. The suspects were taken to the State Security 
Court.

<F P=106> ["Text" of interview with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan by the </F>
German-based Kurdish news agency KURD-A; place and date not 
given] 
  [Excerpts] KURD-A: Mr. Ocalan, we want to hear 
from you about the outcome of Turkey's extensive military 
operations against the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]. 
  Ocalan: It could be said that the special warfare 
is now trying to launch its final onslaught by turning for the 
last time to its domestic and foreign supporters and to its 
highly developed combat experience. In his latest statement, 
the Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures said: "They have three 
to four months to live." During his visit to Sirnak he also 
said: "We have other weapons not used so far." He was, of 
course, implying chemical weapons. He says: "If need be, we 
can use them too." This is a great threat. Already, nothing has 
remained unused. Such statements clearly show that the regime 
is in a difficult bind. He wants to use the last few months in 
office to accomplish his annihilation mission -- and this has 
been practiced for the last millennium -- in a manner befitting 
his ancestors. This is barbarism. [passage omitted decrying 
regime] 
  KURD-A: You know the situation in South Kurdistan 
[Iraqi Kurdistan]. How do you assess Turkey's role in the 
clashes between the Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] and 
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]? 
  Ocalan: This is how the plan worked out recently 
is unfolding. The head of the special warfare is shouting every 
day: "We want to attack northern Iraq with a joint plan." They 
have forged an underhanded agreement with the Iraqi regime. 
[passage omitted] 
  Besides, there is also the interests of the United States 
and 
the "new world order." Under this "new order" the United States 
cannot give unconditional approval to Turkey's blind, 
colonialist-imperialist ambitions. Otherwise, its own interests 
will be under threat. Turkey also wants to launch an 
imperialist-colonialist policy no less inferior than the U.S.. 
Therefore, there are contradictions among them, even if at 
tactical level. Turkey will also experience similar 
contradictions with Iran and Syria. [passage omitted] 
  Unlike Turkey, the United States might not like the Saddam 
regime to exist in its present form. Turkey has oil pipeline 
problems, a serious economic crisis, and wants to monopolize the 
economic plunder in Iraq. This is a vital issue. Therefore, 
friction with the United States was inevitable. 
  Essentially, there is a plan, which has been worked out over 
the last three months, to completely eliminate the PKK. The 
Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures has made a promise to the 
Turkish nation and is now saying: "I will definitely fulfill 
this promise." They have now formulated a plan, which somewhat 
resembles the 1992 plan, but it is not completely identical. 
This is rather a Turkey-patented plan. We are not in a 
position to say exactly what extent this plan obtained the 
United States' approval. The Germans and the French are 
possibly behind this plan. It could even be that Russia has 
decided not to raise much clamor about it. They might even want 
to enlist Iran in this plan. We know that initiatives in this 
direction are taking place, Demirel has decided to pay a visit 
to Iran. Demirel also went to Egypt, most probably to enlist 
Egypt in this plan. He might want to secure an Egyptian role in 
Kurdistan similar to the latter's role during the Iraqi 
incursion into Kuwait. The United States might decide to give 
direction to this plan. We think that the United States will 
not do such a thing because of its differences with other 
states, but then on the other hand it might support this plan. 
The situation is confusing because of these uncertainties. Who 
is in this plan and to what extent? What we know at this stage 
is that Turkey is guiding this plan, and England, and hence the 
United States, will not fully support it. 
  KURD-A: What are the dimensions of this plan in 
the North [Kurdish regions in Turkey]? You know that there are 
ongoing efforts or preparations to form a Kurdish party 
dependent on the state. 
  Ocalan: Yes, one wonders how a traitor Kurd 
[former Turkish cabinet minister Serafettin Elci], who was in 
the service of the special warfare just yesterday, could raise 
up his head? He will admit his Kurdish identity but will remain 
thoroughly loyal to the Turkish state! He will be Muslim but 
will not endorse Shari'ah. He will oppose if (we describe 
Shari'ah as the correct Islam)? [sentence as published] What 
sort of a Muslim would he be opposing Shari'ah? This is enormous 
duplicity and hypocrisy. I do not know if he will be liberal, 
but it is said that he will have links to this or that! There 
has never been such an extreme blend of reactionism and 
progressivism! It is said that the person in question is aiming 
to become the Ozal of the Kurds. They say the revolutionary war 
will be crushed within few months, that the plan has already 
been put into effect, and that they have great hopes of success. 
They would not have been able to prolong their success had they 
not been so hopeful. The traitors have pinned great hope on 
Turkey's success. They were also pinning the same hopes on the 
1992 Southern war [when Turkey launched attacks in northern 
Iraq] and were shouting "long live Turkey." These were the 
slogans used in greeting their real masters in their difficult 
days. Now they trust Turkey even more, apparently they have 
received guarantees. This movement of agents and traitors is 
biding its time. 
  The revolutionary militanism and patriotism is being 
suppressed and eliminated in the South. The plan is also to 
eliminate them in the north and lay a huge Kurdistan table in 
front of them [agents and traitors]! They would be allowed to 
sell off as much as they could, eat as much as they want, but it 
would be sufficient not for forty but for four hundred years, 
and that would save their lineage! 
  Yes, all the collaborationists are acting within this plan. 
It is obvious how cruel the plan is. It applies to those who 
have no relation to homeland, people, freedom, and life, and who 
have involved in plunder, exploitation of labor, and sucked 
human blood to make such ghastly fun of people as old as 
mankind, not to let-up their oppressive grip on the people, and 
to deceive themselves with the claim that they are "succeeding" 
on this issue. 
  KURD-A: Finally, we want to know how you assess 
this existing situation from PKK's perspective. 
  Ocalan: At this point revolutionary tactics enter 
the developments. Sometimes, a situation arises requiring the 
reassessment of tactics. PKK has some experience in this 
direction. We have prepared ourselves considerably against DPK's 
stealthy politics. For the last 20 years of ideological, 
political, and practical work, we have been duty-bound to 
formulate correct positions against it. Basically, our tactic 
is to prevent DPK's collaborationism. We are faced with a 
situation of constantly giving replies. This will not only be a 
wide initiative within Kurdistan, it will also spill the problem 
over to the international level; it will lead to the emergence 
of some sort of an independent force and open the way for 
intensive diplomacy. It will seriously affect Turkey. It will 
not only bring its plan to destroy Kurdistan to naught, but also 
open the way for revolutionary war plans to gain strength. It 
will not lead to suffocation but breathing, not to retreat but 
advance and growth. Already there are Northerners now going to 
the South. Already the people in the North have physically 
joined with the people in the South. The people living on two 
sundered fragments should unite in some way. In 1990 the people 
of South got to know the people of the North, and now the people 
of the North are uniting with the people of the South. This 
will have international repercussions. It may open the way for 
UN support. All these will enormously strain Turkey's regional 
balances and status quo. 
  Without a doubt we will put all these into effect. More 
importantly, we will intensify our activity. We will apply 
pressure in the political and diplomatic arenas. It appears 
that this counter-revolutionary plan has increased the chances 
of the revolutionary plan. That is, this counter-revolutionary 
plan might feed the revolutionary plan; it could be utilized for 
that purpose. We are not carried away with illusions. Most 
importantly, we are not waiting for developments to take their 
own turn. Developments could be given a direction by hard work.

replied to reporters' questions on various issues in Afyon 
today. In answer to a question on whether he had sent a letter 
to the Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, Demirel 
said: Yes, I sent him a letter on the terrorism issue.

as a result of security forces' operations, Demirel reiterated 
his call to those involved in terrorism to surrender. 
  Demirel stated that according to Turkey's observations, the 
terrorists mostly escaped to Iran. Explaining that Iranian 
officials show a lot of goodwill regarding this issue, Demirel 
recalled that the territory is very rugged. Demirel said the 
following regarding his letter to Rafsanjani: 
  [Begin Demirel recording] I know that Iran will not give 
protection to those murderers but, nevertheless, the information 
we have is that they are being given shelter in certain areas 
and I noted their names in my letter. The Iranian president has 
always greatly respected me and carefully considered what I say. 
I have informed Rafsanjani that Turkey is disturbed regarding 
this issue. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Punctuation as published] </F>
  [Excerpts] Zele/Brussels, KURDISH NEWS AGENCY--President 
Suleyman Demirel has recently mentioned several times that the 
"question of terrorist activities" has been resolved and the 
Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] has been crushed. Demirel's remarks 
usually came after an argument on the question of the retirement 
of General Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff. 
  However, Demirel has said in the meetings he has held with 
businessmen and the opening ceremonies of various establishments 
that he fears what may happen in June. He stressed that a 
multisided and unpreventable political crisis will emerge if the 
present situation is allowed to continue in Turkey. [passage 
omitted] 
  The KURDISH NEWS AGENCY has asked the PKK circles to comment 
on the matter. Cemil Bayik, head of the Kurdish People's 
Liberation Army [KPLA] Military Council, and Kani Yilmaz, 
representative of the Kurdish People's Liberation Front in 
Europe, conveyed their views to the news agency by telephone. 
[passage omitted] 
  Bayik said: "If the Turkish Republic's and the Turkish 
newspapers' propaganda that the PKK has been crushed is true, 
then why do they maintain their struggle? It is meaningful that 
Demirel fears what may happen in June. He has already mentioned 
the possibility of significant political instability. He has 
begged the businessmen and warned them that the PKK will have 
achieved its wish and objective if a negative development takes 
place." 
  Stressing that the PKK has achieved significant success in 
increasing the number of its militants from 30,000 to 60,000 in 
1994, Bayik asserted that the 500,000-strong Turkish military 
forces have failed to stand against KPLA's guerrilla forces. 
<H5>  The State Is Killing Its Own Soldiers </H5>
  Cemil Bayik asserted the following: "The Turkish military 
units are ambushed every day. They suffer hundreds of 
casualties. The State of Emergency Governor's Office has 
claimed that the military units kill 50-100 guerrillas every day 
and that they have destroyed the PKK. All that is a trite 
tactic in psychological warfare. We found the remains of 15 
soldiers on Kato Mountain yesterday. The traces of burns on 
their bodies indicated that chemical weapons were used in that 
area. We monitor their radio communications. The communicators 
talk in English from time to time. They inform each other that 
that type of weapon should not be used in this or that place 
because of the presence of military units." 
  Bayik stressed that the incident on Kato Mountain has 
indicated that the military forces, which are in a helpless 
situation, have used chemical arms on their own units. He 
described that as a development which has unveiled the barbaric 
nature of the Turkish State. Cemil Bayik also said that the 
incident clarified the situation to many families who have asked 
for information on where their sons have been. 
  Bayik stressed that the statements that the PKK has been 
either crushed or weakened or suppressed are aimed at misleading 
the international media organs. He said: "They are trying to 
strengthen their morale and hide their failure by waging 
psychological warfare. They are convinced that their effort 
will obstruct recruits from joining the PKK. The daily 
statements that are issued by the State of Emergency Governor's 
Office are unfounded. They are aimed at strengthening the 
morale of the military units." 
  Cemil Bayik also commented on the "package on democracy." He 
said: "It will provide for an increase in the number of village 
guards, establishment of tribal political parties, cooperation 
with Democratic Party of Kurdistan [DPK] leader Mas'ud Barzani, 
programs aimed at suppressing the people. In fact, that is why 
the Turkish officials provoke the clashes in southern Kurdistan 
[northern Iraq]. Their objective is to create fratricide among 
the Kurds. However, their effort will fail to yield results. 
We have been trying to end the clashes in northern Iraq right 
from the beginning. We have supported the people's just 
demands." [passage omitted] 
  Bayik stressed that international circles have focused 
significant attention on the proposals Abdullah Ocalan made in 
the message he conveyed to the conference the Kurds held in 
Europe some time ago and noted that they have moved to put 
pressure on Turkey to force the Turkish officials to agree to 
them for the solution of the Kurdish problem. [passage omitted] 
  Yilmaz said that the Turkish State established June as its 
target in the special war it wages against the Kurdish people. 
He asserted: "The Turkish Republic's move against Kurdistan 
and the bombing of Kurdistan's territory are linked with its 
target, which is June. The Turkish officials are aware that a 
military defeat will worsen the economic crisis and political 
instability. That will create a chaotic situation in Turkey. 
That is why the present government has moved to determine how 
long we should live. However, whether that government will 
survive until June is debatable." [passage omitted] 
  Yilmaz also commented on how the DPK has been encouraged to 
attack the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]. He drew 
attention to PKK's initiatives to end the fighting and stressed 
that the DPK is not an organization that acts according to its 
own free will. In fact, he said that the DPK organized its 
onslaught against the PUK in cooperation with Turkey. Yilmaz 
asserted: "Most probably, Germany, France, and Iraq are also 
involved in that operation. Mas'ud Barzani attacked the PKK 
together with the Turkish military forces in 1992. He has been 
encouraged by the Turkish military forces and the Western 
countries to attack PUK at the present time. The DPK is a 
collaborationist and treacherous organization, which wishes to 
create fratricide in Kurdistan. Those who engage in such 
activities must not be expected to agree to establish peace. 
They have no will of their own."

<F P=106> [Report by Sedat Sertoglu: "An Appalling Trap for Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] Several groups in Europe, which are supported by 
pro- Greek-Cypriot and pro-Armenian elements in the U.S. 
Congress and Mrs. Danielle Mitterrand, have put into effect a 
very dangerous plan, which can fragment Turkey. These groups, 
which have not been effective enough in their initiatives in 
Europe, have managed to raise the Kurdish problem in Washington. 
In fact, they have already made several initiatives to 
influence the U.S. Congress and the newspapers. Several U.S. 
officials have already cautioned Ankara on the plan to divide 
Turkey. The Turkish Foreign Ministry officials have launched an 
effort to have the necessary measures put into effect against 
the new plan. 
  According to the experts, the plan, which has been drawn up 
by several groups that support the Greek Cypriots, Armenians, 
and the Kurds, is as follows: The U.S. will be frequently 
informed that Turkey's military operations against the PKK are 
aimed against the entire Kurdish people in that country. Turkey 
will be accused of committing an act of genocide against all the 
Kurds. Speakers will be selected to address the U.S. Congress 
commissions and international platforms on the matter. That 
will create a wave of pressure against the Clinton 
administration. Next will be a move by those who are aware that 
Turkey will not hold talks with PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, to 
persuade that organization to reduce its terrorist activities 
and publish bulletins to defend its case. The PKK bulletins 
will be similar to those the PLO published in the past. 
<H5>  New Headquarters </H5>
  The next step will be an effort to find a country that will 
agree to host Abdullah Ocalan and his organization. An effort 
is being made at the present time to determine whether or not 
the PKK can be moved, as in the case of the PLO moving its 
headquarters to Tunisia after the defeat it suffered in Lebanon 
in the past. Two reasons have been given for that. The first 
is that the PKK will not be able to remain in Damascus after 
Syria and Israel conclude a peace agreement and the second is 
that Saddam Husayn will not agree to allow Ocalan and his 
organization to remain in Iraq because he eagerly waits for the 
embargo to be lifted. The experts have said that several 
initiatives have been made to find a new host country for the 
PKK either in north Africa or in Europe. 
  As soon as Ocalan and the PKK are transferred to a new 
country, the Western capitals, Washington in particular, will 
direct pressure on Ankara to force it to hold talks with Ocalan, 
who will have assumed a position similar to that of 'Arafat. 
Ankara will be informed that Ocalan is no longer involved in 
terrorist activities. 
  Meanwhile, the architects of that appalling plan will make 
every effort to disrupt relations between Ankara and Washington. 
They will use every opportunity to create friction between 
Turkey and the United States in the foreign policy domain. 
Furthermore, they will try to create a reaction in the U.S. 
public opinion against Turkey. 
  Considering all that, the experts have warned Ankara to be 
very careful.

<F P=106> [By Ian Graham, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>
  [Text] Several soldiers and civilians were injured in a 
mortar bomb attack on a security forces checkpoint outside 
Crossmaglen, south Armagh today. 
  Police said the checkpoint, half a mile from the town centre 
on the Blaney Road, was manned by both police and troops. 
  A spokesman said the number and extent of the casulties was 
not known. No members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] 
were thought to have been hurt and first reports indicated no 
one was killed. 
  A single Mark 15 IRA mortar appeared to have been fired at 
the checkpoint from a VW van stopped a short distance down the 
road, said the spokesman. The mortar is said to have missed the 
checkpoint but to have exploded nearby. The checkpoint is part 
of the huge security cordon the army and police have thrown 
around the area in recent weeks to protect construction workers 
strengthening the fortifications around the frequently attacked 
security base in Crossmaglen. 
  The Army said three soldiers had been injured and taken to 
Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Their injuries were not life 
threatening. 
  One civilian was treated by a local doctor, said police. 
  The mortar, which the IRA admitted firing, just missed the 
VCP [vehicle checkpoint] and caused damage to a nearby house. 
  Police said later up to four civilians suffered minor 
injuries. A police spokesman said there was no warning about the 
attack. "The attack was carried out by vicious and ruthless men 
who care nothing for the life and limb of any individual."

<F P=106> [Article by Colin Randall in Belfast: "IRA Border Post </F>
Attack Kills Soldier"] 
  [Text] A lance-corporal killed in an IRA bomb attack on a 
look-out post in Co Armagh at the weekend was the first soldier 
to be murdered by terrorists in Northern Ireland this year. 
  L/Cpl David Wilson, a single man from Greenock, Scotland, of 
9 Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, died while guarding the RUC 
station at Keady, about two miles from the border, late on 
Saturday night. It was his first tour of duty in Northern 
Ireland. Another soldier suffered severe shock. 
  Although the terrorists were at first thought to have fired 
a 
mortar at the post, police said last night that the blast was 
caused by a small bomb placed on a wall. 
  Loyalist gunmen opened fire with an automatic weapon as 
about 
200 people taking part in a Sinn Fein march made their way to a 
rally in Belfast city centre yesterday. 
  The Ulster Freedom Fighters admitted responsibility for the 
attack in which no one was injured.

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Savill, Irish correspondent: "Workmen </F>
Shot Dead by Loyalist Terrorists"] 
  [Excerpt] Loyalist terrorists shot dead two Roman Catholic 
men and slightly injured another as they worked at a sheltered 
housing development in north Belfast yesterday. 
  The attack by the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force took place 
as the Government planned its response to Sinn Fein's questions 
about future policy on Northern Ireland. 
  The two dead men, both electricians, one in his 40's and the 
other in his 20's, were believed to come from the mid-Ulster 
area. 
  Their names were not being released until relatives had been 
informed. 
  Witnesses said the men were hit by automatic fire during 
their lunchbreak as they sat in a car on a building site in the 
Tiger's Bay area of the city. 
  Police later made several arrests and seized firearms during 
raids in the area. 
  The murders bring to 17 the number of terrorist killings in 
the province in the past month.

<F P=106> [Article: "Loyalist Gunman Kills Teenage Student"] </F>
  [Text] A student died when a Loyalist gunman sprayed the 
offices of a taxi firm in the centre of Armagh city. The man 
pushed an elderly woman to one side and shot Gavin Patrick 
McShane, 17, as he played a gaming machine. Two other people 
were also hit, one seriously. A witness who found the three 
victims said: "Apparently the gunman had pointed the weapon at 
the girl despatcher, but the gun jammed." 
  The attack came as the Government continued to prepare its 
response to Sinn Fein's demand for clarification of the Downing 
Street peace declaration. But Seamus Mallon, the SDLP MP whose 
constituency offices are directly opposite the taxi firm, urged 
an early resumption of talks. He said: "If we have the courage 
of our own political convictions we should take that declaration 
and build upon it."

<F P=106> [Article by Richard Savill, in Belfast: "Third Member of </F>
Family Killed by IRA"] 
  [Text] The body of a Royal Irish Regiment soldier was found 
dumped in a field in Northern Ireland yesterday hours after the 
IRA said it had carried out another murder. 
  An Army helicopter spotted the body of Private Reginald 
McCollum, 19, from Cookstown, Co Tyrone, on land between two 
housing estates on the outskirts of Armagh. Security forces were 
not immediately able to recover the body for fear that it had 
been booby-trapped. Pte McCollum, a single man, had been in the 
RIR for 16 months and was based in Armagh. He was last seen at a 
chip shop in the city at 2.30am after attending a stag night. 
  It was the third time his family have mourned a member 
killed 
at the hands of the IRA. 
  A year ago his brother Nigel, 25, was killed by an IRA 
mortar 
bomb fired at a police station in Keady, Co Armagh. He was a 
civilian contractor operating a crane for renovation work on the 
station when it was attacked. 
  Ten years ago Pte McCollum's grandmother was killed by a 
booby-trap bomb meant for someone else. 
  Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, challenged 
the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, to condemn the killing as 
well as the recent murder by the IRA of Fred Anthony, a police 
cleaner, and the injuring of his three-year-old daughter, Emma. 
  He said: "The IRA is killing again, this time after 
interrogating their victim. Is Mr Adams, who calls for peace, 
now going to condemn these crimes?" 
  "The IRA besmirch all they touch including the cause of 
Irish 
nationalism, just as the UVF, the UFF, and their like, besmirch 
the cause of Unionism." 
  The murder is the first by the IRA since the Government's 
response on Thursday to Sinn Fein's demands for clarification of 
the Downing Street Declaration. 
  The killing would suggest that some activists are intent on 
ignoring calls by Dublin and the mainly nationalist SDLP for the 
terrorists to suspend their violence while the Government's 
reply is considered.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Poroskov: "The Army Will Be Like Its </F>
Officer Corps Will Be"] 
  [Text] The Army and Navy are above all the officer corps. 
As it will be, so will be the Armed Forces, and the course of 
reforms depends most of all on it. What are the officer cadres 
like today? They represent more than 100 nationalities and about 
80 percent are Russian. About 90 percent have a higher military 
or specialized military education. More than 28 percent of the 
officers have served in their positions for less than a year. 
  In comparison with the beginning of last year, the number of 
officers in the Russian Armed Forces has declined by almost 8 
percent, and the strength level of the Army and Navy was 85 
percent of the required number of officer cadres (all figures 
were as of the beginning of 1994). 
  A major problem for the Army was the mass discharge of young 
officers up to 30 years of age. More than 95,000 of them left 
the Armed Forces in 1990-1993 becuase of the disorder and the 
loss of prestige in the service. People in this blossoming age 
accounted for one-third of those discharged last year and more 
than half in the Airborne Troops. About 5,000 people are at the 
disposal of commanding officers, commanders of different 
ranks--sometimes for three to six months. 
  Through the efforts, by no means insignificant, of the Main 
Directorate for the Training and Distribution of Cadres [GUPiRK] 
and local personnel agencies, it was possible to stop the 
unplanned discharge of more than 20,000 people, and there was a 
reduction of the number of officers going to sovereign states. 
By the way, of the more than 13,000 who left last year for the 
near abroad, [many] were young people who, as everyone knows, 
are inclined to heed their emotions. Many, not being able to 
reach the desired place, as they say, are besieging the 
reception room of the Ministry of Defense of Russia and the 
GUPiRK with requests that they be allowed to return. As a rule, 
such people are not accepted, with the possible exception of 
those who finish school not so long ago, provided that they are 
not motivated by mercantile considerations. 
  There is still one other painful problem, the discharge of 
officers who have reached the maximum age and who have a right 
to a pension. Here last year's plan was fulfilled at 81 percent, 
in part because the discharge of this category is more than made 
up for locally by the discharge of young officers. Even of the 
1,400 officers sent to other ministries and departments, more 
than half are junior officers who turned out to be "superfluous" 
despite the condition of being under strength. 
  As of today, there are about 10,000 officers who have 
reached 
the maximum age, and about 6 percent of them have "outgrown" the 
limit by five years or more. If the plan for discharges is not 
fulfilled, then by the end of the year, in the opinion of 
Col.-Gen. Yevgeniy Vysotskiy, chief of the GUPiRK, almost 
another 12,000 will be added to the present 10,000. Of course it 
is necessary to maintain experienced cadres, but without thereby 
forgetting about the prospects of young officers. 
  The condition of being under strength is partially being 
compensated by women--there are more than 1,500 of them in 
officer positions, mostly medical personnel and translators. A 
new source of manpower acquisition is the voluntary service of 
reserve officers under contract. Last year there were just 820 
such volunteers, mostly specialists from the Ground Forces. 
Apparently a minor help in the situation will be the call-up of 
15,000 reserve officers in accordance with a justified edict of 
the president of the Russian Federation. Even military 
educational institutions as a basic source of manpower 
acquisition can hardly fill one-fourth of the existing needs. 
  The enumerated problems can in part be explained by the not 
always smooth introduction into operation of individual statutes 
and articles of new laws on military questions, organizational 
and personnel measures, the reduction of the numerical strength 
of the forces, and the decline in the prestige of the individual 
in service. But there are also shortcomings within the Army. 
Many officers are dismissed from positions, primarily command 
and staff positions. Last year 26 commanders of brigades, 
regiments, and ships first rank were removed. In a number of 
cases, the removal took place less than a year after 
appointment. The reason clearly lies in the low quality of the 
selection process. Hence the significant costs--a worthy 
candidate who is not accepted, undermining of the faith of 
subordinates in their commander, and a worsening of results as 
well as expenditures in connection with the move to a new place 
of service and so on. 
  It is also reasonable to seek the reason for this phenomenon 
in the existing certification procedures. They were established 
back in 1977 and refined somewhat in 1985, but, in the opinion 
of the leadership of the GUPiRK, they have become obsolete. 
Moreover the simultaneous one-time certification of all officers 
will inevitably lead to elements of formalism. Work is being 
done to prepare new guidance on the certification of officer 
personnel. It will be announced by order of the minister of 
defense, but after the putting into effect of the Statute on the 
Order of the Performance of Military Service, which includes 68 
articles and 8 chapters. The draft of this document has been 
submitted to the Government of the Russian Federation and it 
will also be introduced to the Duma for discussion. 
  Despite some expenditures and difficulties, the officer 
corps 
of the Russian Federation is gradually acquiring more definite 
contours. A normative-legal base has been established in 
principle, and the first stage in the transition to a contract 
system has had a positive influence on the quality of the 
officers. In a number of cases, it was possible to eliminate 
"ballast" and the system of military education that was 
disrupted with the collapse of the USSR has been fully restored. 
The second stage of its reform has begun and a list of 
specialties for which there is training in institutes of higher 
education of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation 
has been refined and put into effect. 
  Still, Col.-Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General 
Staff, calls the situation with respect to military cadres 
complex and ambiguous, one that requires timely and balanced 
actions. Among the directions specified for work with cadres in 
the longer term is the raising of professionalism, the 
improvement of the system for manpower acquisition and training 
of officers, and their social protection. But perhaps the main 
thing is the preservation of the officer corps, without which, I 
repeat, there is no Army.

<F P=106> [Ivan Ivanyuk report: "An Army Without Housing, Weapons, or </F>
Hope. That Is the Possible Result of Budget Cuts"] 
  [Text] Recently our newspaper has repeatedly addressed the 
problem of financing defense expenditure. We have done this by 
no means out of corporate or lobby interests, but because we are 
convinced that only a profoundly indifferent and incompetent 
person could stand by and observe the way in which, on the 
pretext of demilitarizing the country and converting military 
production, the actual destruction of the Army and Navy and 
simultaneously of the economy itself is taking place. 
  Why of the economy? Because once again the idea that all 
economic matters can be rectified at the Armed Forces' expense 
is being trotted out. In the four years in which politicians 
and economists have diligently put it into effect, this idea has 
become fairly decrepit and has brought no improvements to 
people's lives. And, although expressed in 1990 prices, the 
military budget has "slimmed down" to half its size, the 
situation both in the Army and the economy has deteriorated. 
  It would seem to be high time to abandon this approach 
toward 
budget procurements and to look at things realistically. But 
this kind of enthusiasm cannot be observed in our economic 
departments. It is much easier to cross out one figure on paper 
and put down another -- slightly smaller -- one than, say, to 
properly organize tax collection so that the budget's income 
element increases rather than catastrophically decreases. Thus, 
according to Economy Ministry data, in the first quarter the 
federal budget received 3.4 trillion rubles [R] less than 
expected in taxes and dues. Naturally, the Finance Ministry 
never has any money. 
  Furthermore, financing military expenditure only to the 
extent that the empty treasury purse is filled, as has been the 
practice recently, is also directly damaging the country's 
economy. For this reason, the Russian Federation Defense 
Ministry Military Budget and Financing Main Directorate has 
estimated that nonproduction expenditure in 1993 totaled R870 
billion, which again required an increase in the defense budget. 
  How is this sum made up? The Defense Ministry was forced to 
pay over R490 billion because scheduled deadlines for paying for 
ordered output were broken, bank credits obtained by supplier 
enterprises and included in the cost of military output came to 
R306 billion, penalties for late payment for transport services 
totaled R37 billion.... 
  In the past year the financing of the draft Russian 
Federation Law "On the State Budget for 1994," which preserves 
the level of defense expenditure proposed by the government, has 
created a ludicrous situation in the Army and Navy. The sum of 
R37.1 trillion represents a mere 42 percent of the requirement, 
and this money could be enough only to pay personnel. There can 
be no question of paying the defense complex, building housing, 
etc. In short, this sum cannot actually be apportioned to 
sections of the military budget. Therefore, it has never been 
seriously discussed. At one time the Finance Ministry officially 
evaluated the draft military budget at R55.5 trillion. 
  Even this compromise level of appropriations, enabling the 
Army to survive somehow, requires considerable adjustment of the 
state defense order approved by the Russian Federation 
Government in December, including for housing for servicemen, 
not to mention a reduction of the range and volume of weapons 
and equipment being purchased. The military budget is now 60 
percent "social" in its structure, and further cuts in it will 
inevitably hit people who as it is do not have sufficient 
guarantees regarding their daily lives. In these conditions the 
Russian Federation Government, without coordinating with the 
Defense Ministry, is submitting to the Duma a draft law on 
suspending a number of articles of the Law on the Status of 
Servicemen, and is attempting to abolish privileges which have 
existed since prewar times. How is this to be viewed? 
  If we closely analyze what makes up the remaining 40 percent 
of defense expenditure, it is evident that it contains a 
considerable volume of enforced expenditure not directly 
associated with military activity. Over R3 trillion, for 
example, is required for the withdrawal of troops from foreign 
countries near and far and for providing them with amenities in 
a new location. It requires considerable expenditure to 
maintain a state of emergency in "hot spots" and to carry out 
peacekeeping activity within the former USSR. The military 
budget is being used to maintain space centers, the air traffic 
safety service, hydrographic and air navigation services, 
lighthouses, and much else that not only the Armed Forces but 
the entire country needs. After all, this comes to trillions of 
rubles, and an adjustment for them should also be made in the 
budget. 
  But, even taking the annual budget of R37.1 trillion, the 
Defense Ministry is not currently being given the full volume of 
funding -- as of 15 May it had already received R4.5 trillion 
less than it should have. While the military department owed a 
total of R6 trillion for the period January-April. An 
impressive figure, it cannot be denied. But this is not what 
gives rise to serious alarm -- the lack of resources makes it 
impossible to properly prepare compounds for winter and 
transport all the essentials to Far North areas. Operational 
and combat training of troops and maintenance of the material 
base and military equipment are being disrupted. 
  Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin has repeatedly 
drawn the attention of the government and parliamentarians to 
the fact that it is necessary to find a solution regarding this 
year's budget without harming the country's defense capability. 
But his instruction of 3 March 1994 has still not been 
implemented. On 6 May the president supported an amendment to 
the draft budget made by the State Duma Defense Committee and 
envisaging an increase of the "National Defense" item to R55 
trillion. 
  One wants to believe that this figure will find support 
among 
State Duma deputies when the federal budget is finally approved. 
This level of appropriations will not, of course, solve all the 
Armed Forces' problems, but at least it will make it possible to 
avoid many minor and major misfortunes which are knocking 
increasingly loudly at the door....

<F P=106> [Article by Colonel Stanislav Baratynov, a Russian </F>
officer: "When the Generals Are Bluffing: The Financial Mafia Is 
Making Millions From the Military Budget"] 
  [Text] For a long time now the highest officials in 
the Russian Ministry of Defense have been vigorously assuring 
our society that military reform is proceeding at full pace. But 
then again, the marasmus is gaining strength. Judging by 
everything, they have even managed to make a fool of the 
president himself, the supreme commander-in-chief. In his 
message to the Federal Assembly, Boris Yeltsin gave quite high 
marks to the course of Armed Forces reform which cheered up the 
highest Russian generals. One of the key ideologues of military 
reform, Assistant Minister of Defense for Military Policy 
Lieutenant-General Gennadiy Ivanov, officially stated at a press 
conference that Yeltsin's very positive response on the course 
of military reform attests to the "correctness of the path 
selected by us". But then it has not been excluded that the 
positive presidential response on reform was also prepared in 
the bowels of the Ministry of Defense, and that General Ivanov 
himself had far from the last participation in it. 
  Let's pose the question this way: Does Yeltsin know 
about the state of military reform? As a General Staff officer 
who worked quite a bit in its structures, as an official who is 
often in the troops and who is well acquainted practically with 
all of the information that affects the assessments of the state 
of combat readiness of the Army, I dare to assure you with all 
responsibility that the supreme commander-in-chief knows exactly 
as much about the state of affairs in the Armed Forces as the 
minister of defense and his closest entourage want him to. 
  General Pavel Grachev at one time admitted that he contacts 
Yeltsin on a daily basis at a strictly determined time and 
reports the most recent and the most important things which 
occurred in the Army. (Let it be on the minister of defense's 
conscience that he doesn't always manage to do that -- it has 
happened that he has been unable to reach the president for 
three-four days). 
  And now imagine that Grachev day after day reports the same 
thing to Yeltsin: combat training of ground troops and naval 
forces is being disrupted everywhere. The moral-psychological 
state of personnel is declining. Theft of arms and ammunition is 
not ceasing. Money is not being issued to personnel in a timely 
manner, and because of that strikes are already beginning in 
units. Nearly 60 percent of the combat pilots have long ago 
forgotten what it is to fly systematically. Plans to introduce 
housing for homeless servicemen are not being carried out. New 
combat equipment is practically not entering the troops and the 
fleets. Scientific and experimental design work has been reduced 
to 10-15 percent. And so on and so forth. 
  We would all need to be too naive, and the minister of 
defense too bold for us to be able to believe that. Grachev 
understands very well: if he day in and day out honestly 
confessed all of this to the president, the quick-tempered Boris 
Nikolayevich would take it up one day and would not mince words: 
if everything is falling apart in the Army, why does it need you 
in the role of minister? Only both of them know precisely how 
and in what form Pavel 
Sergeyevich reports to Boris Nikolayevich. But we already know 
for certain what the supreme commander-in-chief's opinion is on 
the state of combat readiness of his Army. In that same (already 
half-forgotten) message to the Federal Assembly, he suddenly 
arrived at the conclusion that the combat readiness of the Armed 
Forces is at a level that permits it to reliably ensure Russia's 
military security. It's easy to guess who led the president to a 
conclusion that is so dreadful in its unfairness. There's no 
doubt that it was first and foremost he who is directly 
responsible for the Army's combat readiness. On this score, I 
will say in passing that it would be good to have an article on 
false reporting of progress on an especially large scale (from 
10 to 15) in our Criminal Code. In order to realistically judge 
the true state of combat readiness of the Army and Navy, it 
would be sufficient for the clerks from the presidential staff 
to request restricted analytical documents and report back 
materials from the Main Military Inspectorate in which they 
would discover, to their great horror, a conclusion that only 
1-2 divisions in each military district and only 1-2 ships in 
each fleet are combat ready today! And that is the main and most 
honest conclusion on the primary result of military reform. And 
based upon it, now judge the "correctness of the path selected 
by us" which both the minister of defense and his court 
theoretician of military structural development so stubbornly 
attempt to convince their fellow countrymen. 
  The combat readiness of the Army is a state category. And he 
who thoroughly deceives his own people with regard to its actual 
state is certainly committing a state crime. But who today could 
place an objective report on the actual state of the Armed 
Forces and on the results of reform on the desks of the 
president, the chairman of the Council of Ministers, and the 
chairmen of both houses of parliament? I can boldly dare to 
assure you -- no one. And this is why. 
  Approximately two-three years ago "democratically minded" 
political figures and people's deputies aggressively spread the 
conclusion that the so-called Ministry of Defense Main 
Inspectorate was incapable of objectively assessing the level of 
combat readiness of ground troops and naval forces because it is 
organizationally part of the military department, and is 
directly subordinate to the minister of defense who, naturally, 
is to a considerable extent an interested party. And that was 
the absolute truth. I personally have repeatedly had the 
opportunity to participate in the work of teams of main 
inspectors in military districts and groups of forces, and to 
write report back and analytical documents. The results of the 
inspection depended to a very large extent, for example, on how 
we were received in the military district or group of forces, 
how the personal relations of the minister of defense and the 
commanding general or main inspector had developed, and what 
quantity of boxes, with all kinds of gifts from those being 
inspected, the inspectors transported back to Moscow. 
  There are many "interesting" episodes in my memory. For 
example, at the beginning of the 1980's, a team of Ministry of 
Defense inspectors traveled to Germany with the undisguised 
mission of replacing Group of Soviet Forces in Germany 
Commander-in-Chief General of the Army Ivanovskiy. Few people 
knew at that time that on the eve of our trip Yevgeniy 
Filippovich had "poorly received" the marshal-inspector, his 
wife, and children for rest. Therefore, the inspection was 
excessively strict, and the result of it was that Ivanovskiy and 
Group Political Directorate Chief General Ivan Mednikov were 
removed at practically the same moment. It is an altogether 
different matter when the commanding general prepares 
beforehand, say, a collection of precious stones. In the Far 
East they sent entire teams of explosives experts into the 
mountains to extract them. After summing up the results of the 
inspection, each inspector received large amounts of red caviar 
and smoked fish. 
  Once they surreptitiously handed the chairman of an 
inspection team an enormous unique coral for which the fleet's 
best scuba divers dove into the depths of the sea. As was 
customary, they carried an identical gift to Moscow for the 
minister of defense (an inspection gift for the minister was 
considered to be an unwritten law for many, many years). Of 
course, all of the primary combat readiness assessments of the 
inspected formations and units had to depend on the quantity and 
quality of the gifts, the generosity of the tables that were set 
three times a day, the content of the so-called cultural program 
(fishing, hunting, swimming in unique sources, baths, saunas, 
and visiting the families of the commanders being inspected 
where "by chance" there frequently turned out to be single women 
and also married garrison women, and, after a certain amount of 
contact with them, an inspector did not really want to write in 
the inspection report that not one of the company's tanks had 
hit the target...). 
  An off-color Army anecdote even existed on this score. 
A not completely sober inspector says to the regimental 
commander in the morning: 
  The battalion is satisfactory but the company is 
unsatisfactory! 
  The regimental commander quickly determined what was 
wrong with the inspector and poured into a glass: 
  And now the battalion is satisfactory and the company 
is outstanding! 
  And when active conversations occurred that General of the 
Army Konstantin Kobets as the main military inspector would 
allegedly be directly subordinate to the president, it became 
clear that now the Ministry of Defense anticipates difficult 
times. But the music played for a short time. "Having hung 
around" for a period of time in an undetermined state, Kobets 
with the entire inspectorate was returned to the native bosom of 
the Ministry of Defense, and is directly subordinate to Grachev. 
Moreover, Yeltsin also assigned Kobets as deputy minister of 
defense. 
  Well, judge for yourselves. Say Kobets traveled to inspect a 
military district. He brought back a grade of two from there. 
Naturally, Grachev is unhappy. How do you report that to the 
president? Naturally, they talked. Naturally, they agreed on the 
fact that "individual shortcomings" exist. And that is already 
easier -- where aren't there individual shortcomings now? 
Therefore, should we report them that way? Order. Let's also 
assure you that "we are at the guaranteed level". And if it 
isn't guaranteed, Boris Nikolayevich will remove them. 
  Matters are being reduced to extraordinarily strange things. 
Today, it is being announced that the Northern Fleet is the best 
in the Russian Navy, but tomorrow practically all of the mass 
media report that the wives of military seamen have gone on 
strike and have blocked the runways: their husbands are not 
being paid on time, they are not being provided with apartments, 
the apartment buildings are cold, and there is nothing to buy in 
the stores. And the combatant commanders themselves say that 
recognition of the fleet as the best in the Navy -- is blasphemy. 
  You only reflect: it was named the best, and, therefore, the 
most combat ready, not the vegetable store, but the entire 
fleet, the Russian strategic combat unit. And you would read 
what the reports from the fleet say about the state of combat 
ships and coastal facilities, about reserves and the 
availability of fuel-lubricants and other materials. It's no 
accident that one submarine commander bitterly joked: "It will 
soon reach the point if just one ship from our fleet leaves the 
quay -- they will then recognize the fleet as the best...". 
  In the Ministry of Defense Main Military Inspectorate they 
know very well precisely what criteria are being utilized to 
determine the combat readiness of a military district or fleet. 
Minister of defense and chief of the general staff special 
orders or directives have long existed on this score. Naturally 
not only the main inspectorate, but also the commander-in-chief 
directorates of the services of the Armed Forces must be 
strictly guided by these criteria. But what actually happens? I 
visited the Pacific Fleet last year on an inspection trip with 
the deputy commander-in-chief. And, suddenly, soon after that we 
read in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA that the fleet's combat readiness will 
largely be assessed based upon the results of the live firing... 
of just one ship which the admiral visited. Well that's a fine 
how-do-you-do! For such a "criterion" to be more understandable 
for a civilian reader, I will say that this is practically the 
same as arriving at a conclusion about the normal state of both 
arms and legs based upon one finger. 
  But that shouldn't happen. Whom are we deceiving? Ourselves. 
One general even contrived to use a word like "nedoboyegotovka" 
[not quite combat ready] while talking about the criteria of the 
state of combat readiness of a division in the troops 
subordinate to him. This is something like "nedoberemenna" [not 
quite pregnant] or "nedoubita" [not quite killed]. Today, as 
never before, an epidemic of gigantic false reporting of 
progress and lies has swept over the Army. The generals inspect 
themselves, they assign grades to themselves, they themselves 
develop the criteria of the state of the troops and fleets, and 
they themselves ignore them, if they see that the state of 
affairs does not reach even a primitive "three". 
  General Konstantin Kobets' main military inspectorate has 
actually been transformed into a well trained and devoted dog of 
the minister of defense. It can vigilantly protect his peace or 
subordinates who are sympathetic to him can "bite" those being 
fined. Recently PVO [Air Defense] Commander-in-Chief, 
Colonel-General Viktor Prudnikov "had the gall" to notify the 
former Supreme Soviet that the air border defense system is 
dying due to the Ministry of Defense's inaction and its 
conciliatory position. The matter at times reached the point 
where foreign and Russian aircraft that were flying, say, from a 
Westerly direction had already nearly penetrated to the skies 
near Moscow. And what about the minister? Not only did he 
severely criticize the PVO commander-in-chief, he also appointed 
an investigation. It's clear -- that it was appointed to remove 
the garbage from the "Arbat Hut". Rumors are already circulating 
that Prudnikov will soon leave his post and will move to 
another, less visible post. And, of course, "according to his 
own desires". 
  And in the background of this state of affairs in the Army, 
General Grachev and his team are furiously whispering into the 
president's ear that reforms in the Army are proceeding at full 
speed. And with each passing month this lie is being 
increasingly and more obviously transformed into a means of 
survival of the generals in their high posts. Of course, these 
are not the generals who courageously placed the barrel of their 
pistols to their temples when it became obvious that their 
troops are not combat ready or when they learned that they had 
been totally misled in the assessments of the state of affairs. 
In my opinion, they themselves are sooner ready to give the 
pistol to settle scores with the lives of those who suddenly 
detect that a gigantic deception is being created and whose 
conscience is beginning to torment them. 
  Let's pose a simple and clear question: what are the 
specific 
results of military reform after its first stage? The father of 
military reform, General 
Ivanov, and the minister of defense always begin by saying: 
first of all the Ministry of Defense was created. Maybe they 
built a new building? Did they lay thousands of lines of 
communication? Did they select new staffs? Did they purchase 
furniture or electronic equipment? Of course not! They obtained 
all of this -- durable capital -- in enormous quantities from 
the old Soviet Ministry of Defense. So, where is the matter 
right now, just where is reform? And it turns out that reform is 
limited to replacing blank forms, stamps, and name plates from 
offices, redrawing the diagram of the organization of the 
military department, altering the names of certain directorates 
and departments, and rewriting functional duties. Perhaps that's 
all. But then again, how loudly it sounds -- "the Ministry of 
Defense was created". 
  And later the most ordinary chaos began which both General 
Grachev himself and his closest subordinate today call reform. 
They all have repeatedly asserted that the Army will be reduced, 
and, therefore, the Ministry of Defense itself will be reduced. 
And at the same time the number of Grachev's assistants has 
increased to seven, and the authorized strength of the military 
department has increased by approximately a factor of 1.5. The 
number of generals on the ministry's floors has also increased. 
It has reached the point where general's ranks have even been 
awarded to those who were in colonel's positions. General's 
shoulder boards have even been donned on a man who is 
responsible for the electric light bulbs and carpeting, the 
decanters and toilet paper. 
  Sometimes you get the impression that Grachev and his 
assistants are playing at reform of the Ministry of Defense 
staff. And how can you say otherwise if the names and functional 
duties of many directorates and departments have been changed 
from three to five times, their chiefs have been replaced, and 
the transfers of enormous masses of people from offices to 
offices have been carried out over the course of one and a half 
years. The missions of some structures have been transferred to 
others, then the missions have been returned, again "taken 
away", and later it suddenly turned out that two and sometimes 
three directorates or departments were involved with one and the 
same issues. And so on --without end. That leapfrogging has laid 
additional financial burdens on the military department, and, 
based upon the simplest calculations, has cost the taxpayers 
many millions of rubles. And, judging by everything, a new 
spiral of organizational-staff leapfrogging awaits the ministry 
already in the near future. 
  The Ministry of Defense leadership, while attempting to pass 
off the desired as the actual, quite often resorts to primitive 
ruses that are calculated for simpletons. For example, the 
reduction of the Army is being passed off as one of the key 
directions of reform. Grachev and company also often place this 
process in the same rank with the so-called "results" of 
military reform. But why make fools of the people? The reduction 
of the Army is a process that goes without saying. Hundreds of 
thousands of officers and warrant officers are leaving the Army 
based upon years served, according to their own desires, or due 
to illness. And many, putting it mildly, "are leaving". So where 
is reform here? Here for some reason I'm reminded of the episode 
of a story where a bureaucrat, who didn't have anything to 
report back to the leadership on the work completed, wrote in 
the report: "Organized the onset of evening". 
  Take any strategic direction of military reform and you will 
see that the state of affairs there is extremely insignificant. 
Yes, for instance, the lack of budget resources for manning of 
the troops with contract personnel which both the minister, his 
deputies and his assistants love to boast about. From the very 
beginning, it was clear that the introduction of contract 
service in the current situation of financial starvation was the 
purest folly. Initially, R6 billion (prices at the end of 1992) 
was allocated for 100,000 contract personnel. Already a year and 
a half later it has become clear that inflation is literally 
gobbling up this sum before our very eyes. It has been barely 
enough to pay the salaries of contract personnel. And it was 
contemplated that they would be provided separate housing or a 
dormitory with all of the comforts, that their work day would be 
standardized, and that they would have quite a few advantageous 
social benefits. It has turned out that all of this is once 
again a lie. People don't even have the opportunity to bathe 
with hot water. And they are writing many letters of complaint 
to the president and to the minister about how they were grossly 
misled. Deception has become an integral element of military 
reform because it sort of compensates for its absence. 
  Today, the Army has barely enough money to pay the salaries 
of personnel. It's no accident that they say when Chief of the 
General Staff Colonel-General Kolesnikov, during his meeting 
with students of the General Staff Academy, was asked by the 
students which of the Army's missions does he consider to be 
most important under current conditions, he flabbergasted 
everyone with his brief answer: "To survive!". 
  Not only that but also many other examples attest to the 
fact 
that military reform is becoming increasingly covered with the 
dirt of immorality. Many honest generals and officers of the 
Ministry of Defense and General Staff treat with great caution, 
for example, that "secret chemistry" which is being created in 
the issues of financing the troops. Ministry of Defense Main 
Directorate for the Military Budget and Financing Chief 
Colonel-General Vasiliy Vorobyev was recently compelled to 
frankly admit a number of devastating facts. Here is just one of 
them. R3 million that had left Moscow for the Northwestern Group 
of Forces has been lost no one knows where for approximately 1.5 
years. Something similar was repeated several months later but 
with a much larger sum. Experts have calculated that during the 
time when the military money "traveled around the world" it 
could be circulated from three to six times and receive a profit 
that totals tens of millions of at that time "wooden rubles". 
General Vorobyev bemoans the fact and sighs. He said these are 
the procedures that we have! The main military financier tries 
to prove that he aggressively looked for the money and wrote 
dozens of letters. But that, in my personal view, was only a 
false imitation of concern. They didn't try too hard to find the 
money, allowing it to circulate even more. Because with the 
sincere desire to "find tails", both the minister and his 
treasurer could have put, as they say, the investigators on 
their ears and could have closed the case in a month maximum. 
But that did not occur. And in the ministry they are already 
openly talking about the fact that A CERTAIN FINANCIAL 
MAFIA EXISTS THAT CIRCULATES MILLIONS FROM THE MILITARY BUDGET 
AND FOR SOME REASON THOSE WHO SHOULD ARE NOT RUSHING TO SORT 
THAT OUT. 
  No matter which sphere of military reform you poke with your 
finger, you see lies, hypocrisy, deception and the powerlessness 
of our highest military leadership everywhere which is 
attempting to put up a bold front. For example, the minister of 
defense quite recently announced to the entire world that the 
housing problem in the Army will be resolved already in 1996. 
Who convinced him of the possibility of doing that -- is unknown. 
  The concept of military reform was publicized in 1992 and 
they divided it into three primary stages. But Military 
Structural Development and Reform Directorate Chief General 
Ivanov is already announcing some sort of new variants of 
structural development of the Russian Army after 1995. And where 
then do you hide the previously approved "general plan" of 
military structural development? You can't make heads or tails 
of it. Sometimes we in the General Staff get the impression that 
not staid generals are involved with military reform but 
children who do not know what they should do with the complex 
electronic toy. But it's no accident that one of the deputy 
ministers of defense was recently compelled to frankly call all 
of this the "the triviality of dilettantes".

<F P=106> [Yuliya Khaytina article: "For Each Enemy--One `Topol.' </F>
Missile Regiment on Combat Alert."] 
  [Text] After saying farewell to Belorussia, the RS-12M 
mobile intercontinental nuclear missiles, customarily called 
simply "Topols" [poplar trees], along with their support 
systems, have arrived home in Russia--in a division in 
Yoshkar-Ola. Col Vladimir Kashkin's missile regiment, having 
gotten off combat alert duty, was not part of our military 
forces which were serving with the 43d Missile Army in Ukraine 
and which were moved out of there by the sensitive local 
leadership, taking nothing with them: All military property now 
belongs to Ukraine. 
  The system of barriers at the "missile corner" where the 
Topols are located is very inhospitable to those not authorized 
to be there. For example, the so-called electrified zone looks 
like a sort of spiney network, through which at regular 
intervals an approximately 1500-volt current flows. 
  Officers and noncommissioned officers service the Topols. 
This gives them the modest right to call themselves Strategic 
Missile Forces professionals. For good service, an officer with 
the rank of major can earn 300 thousand rubles a month--they get 
money for food, for keeping up appearances, for shift duty, and 
for other good things in life. In view of the fact that most 
men in military service do not have apartments and do not expect 
to have them any time soon, but do have plenty of unemployed 
wives and hungry children, one can say happily that our great 
Motherland's nuclear shield is in the hands of enthusiasts! 
  But fortunately the country is poor and the Defense Ministry 
poorer, while an officer is a sort of father in a subsistence 
economy. He must not only service the missiles, but in his 
"free time"--as if he had any--he must build a barracks, mess 
hall, and so on. Their desperate wives stubbornly work as 
communications officers, dispatchers, and so on, and proudly 
contribute their 150 thousand rubles to the family budget. 
There are 108 of them in Vladimir Kashkin's regiment--almost 
the entire communications and medical staff. 
  Vladislav Zotin, president of the Republic of Mariy El, 
after 
he attended the above-mentioned ceremony, felt so sincerely 
about "his" military men that he thought that the best way to 
prevent bad consequences in the missile forces was to visit 
personally the General Staff in Moscow. He asked for more 
generous financing so that the forces could be at normal 
strength. As to whether the presidential travels will help the 
missile troops--who knows, but his travels have made them feel 
more friendly towards their commanders.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Dolinin of KRASNAYA ZVEZDA: "Another </F>
Regiment Equipped With `Topol' Missiles on Combat Alert Duty"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported in KRASNAYA 
ZVEZDA, three missile regiments armed with the RS-12M Topol 
mobile missile systems have joined the force composition of the 
Strategic Rocket Forces [RVSN]. These are replacing those 
removed from duty earlier in strict conformity with 
international agreements. 
  The regiment commanded by Colonel Vladimir Kashkin is 
stationed in Yoshkar-Ola. It entered combat alert duty on April 
19. Our correspondents report on this event. 
  Division commander Major-General Musa Tsechoyev relates that 
this is not the first rearmament in the 30-year history of the 
formation, which is now armed with RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-12M 
(SS-25) missiles. But this one is a special event, since it is 
taking place in difficult times for the country. 
  The new regiment was formed almost two years ago. It was 
manned partly with servicemen who had come from Belarus and 
Ukraine. There was much work to do. They had to get set up. The 
combat position required was a new one, but there were no funds 
to speak of. 
  "We are working in debt today," said the chief of the UNR 
[Directorate of the Chief of Operations], Colonel Aleksandr 
Katyukhin, "we have taken on two billion in debt at the bank." 
  The missile troops themselves took up the shovels, but the 
main thing was to learn the hardware that they would be 
receiving. The three-month practice at the proving ground at 
Mirnyy was a real test. It concluded with a special tactical 
exercise that was rated as "good." 
  The president and head of the government of the Republic of 
Mariy El, Vladislav Zotin, and the assistant commander-in-chief 
of the RVSN for indoctrination, Major-General Nikolay Moroz, 
visited the formation on the day they went onto combat alert 
duty. 
  The president answered a question about what the attitude of 
the strategic missile troops to the republic is by saying, "Most 
respectful. We have good, businesslike relations." 
  The first to enter combat alert duty along with the 
commander 
were Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy Nazarov, Majors Aleksandr 
Dubovik, Aleksandr Bolgarskiy, Captain Aleksandr Rudkin, Senior 
Lieutenant Igor Bachev, Warrant Officer Elvira Volkova... They 
possibly did not think that their taking of their combat posts 
would go down in history. 
  It was no accident that Deputy Regimental Commander 
Lieutenant-Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin distributed historic 
information on the Guards Red Banner Akhtyr-Aleksandriya Orders 
of Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Regiment to the 
correspondents--a large portion of the officers from the 
reinforcements had served in it. This had been a Hussar regiment 
at one time under the command of Denis Davydov, in which 
Lermontov and Alyabev had served... The unit also won honor in 
the Great Patriotic War. Its battle standard and orders are now 
in the Central Museum of the Armed Forces. 
  "For some reason," the missile troops puzzled, "we are 
easily 
able to part with legendary history, and are creating a new 
regiment. It is as if we are starting with a clean slate." 
  It would perhaps be fair to preserve the honored name for 
the 
new, Topol regiment, for which everything lies ahead.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Anatoliy Golovnev, chief of </F>
the Main Directorate for Combat Training and deputy commander in 
chief of the Ground Forces, by Colonel Gennadiy Miranovich; date 
and place not given: "A State's Might Is Also Measured by the 
Level of Its Army Training"] 
  [Text] From KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's files: Anatoliy Andreyevich 
Golovnev. Born Smolensk Oblast 1942. Graduated from the Moscow 
Higher Combined Arms Command College (1963), and the M.V. Frunze 
(1973) and General Staff (1980) Military Academies. He has 
served in various command and staff positions. In August 1992 
he moved from his job as first deputy commander of Moscow 
Military District to be appointed chief of the Main Directorate 
for Combat Training and deputy commander in chief of the Ground 
Forces. 
  [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the Main Directorate for 
Combat Training is, it seems to me, the "lawmaker" when it comes 
to training specialists on various types of weapons. At least 
that was the case in the Soviet Army. Or are things different 
now? 
  [Golovnev] Fortunately, the procedure of disparaging our 
Soviet past (something which some of the mass media have had 
some success at) has left Armed Forces combat training -- 
clearly, a little-known area to the writing fraternity -- 
virtually untouched. 
  As before, we are elaborating draft field manuals and 
general 
military regulations along with a program for training officers 
and noncommissioned officers from various combat arms, and we 
are cooperating closely with combat training organs in the Navy, 
Air Defense Forces, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] 
troops, and the Border Guards.... In short, the Main 
Directorate for Combat Training is a kind of coordination center 
for scientific and methodological ideas and developments in the 
combat training sphere. Services from the Russian Ministry for 
Emergency Situations, various scientific research institutes, 
and military academies -- including the General Staff Academy -- 
actively cooperate with us. Training in the Commonwealth 
countries' armies is virtually based on our developments. 
  Such a role for our directorate is dictated by life itself. 
The organizational development of a new army, the changing of 
doctrinal views of the nature of modern warfare, the creation of 
force and troop groupings to meet that challenge, and the new 
priorities in military-technical policy all require a 
reinterpretation of certain canons of combat training. 
  For instance, we have never before faced the problem of 
training units for peacekeeping forces. Naturally, we had 
neither the relevant training programs nor the training base. 
Now, as you are aware, we are fully tackling this issue. And 
not without success. 
  [Miranovich] Which is something, regrettably, that cannot be 
said of the Ground Forces as a whole, most of whose combined and 
other units posted only satisfactory results in the last 
training year. And other branches of the Armed Forces have not 
turned in a brilliant performance, but put it bluntly. 
  [Golovnev] You are right there. But, given that this is no 
worse than in 1992, when Russia announced the creation of its 
own Armed Forces, and that the process of the decline in the 
standard of combat training has nonetheless been halted, 
then.... Incidentally, for me to predict some kind of 
breakthrough in this area in the very near future would be, at 
the very least, unprofessional. 
  [Miranovich] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's mailbag shows, many people 
see one of the reasons for what we could call the ailing state 
of combat training in our Army as being that it is by no means 
looked upon as a priority everywhere. Yet the regulations of 
the Russian Federation Armed Forces' Internal Service -- in 
whose elaboration you participated, incidentally -- stated that 
combat training "is the main component of the everyday activity 
of servicemen in peacetime." It also stipulates that 
proceedings will be instituted against commanders (chiefs) 
guilty of taking personnel away from exercises. What can you 
say about this? 
  [Golovnev] Do you think that officers just take personnel 
away from exercises at their own discretion? Yes, there are 
cases when personal interests hamper some people in the 
performance of their duties. And they receive a principled 
assessment -- as provided for by the regulations. I can name a 
number of officers who have paid a high price for this. 
  But let's call a spade a spade -- the reason why personnel 
are taken out of planned combat training is primarily due to 
manpower levels, which compel commanders to divert considerable 
amounts of forces and resources to ensure the everyday activity 
of combined and other units. The destruction of existing 
economic ties has sharply complicated the organization of 
material provision for the training process. The quality of 
training is suffering owing to the untimely elaboration and 
delivery by the Ministry of the Defense Industry of simulators 
for new types of weapons and equipment. And the cost of 
training has been rising considerably, since we have been forced 
to use equipment already in service. 
  How soon will the situation change for the better? That 
depends on how soon we all agree that a state's might is also 
measured by the level of its Army training. 
  [Miranovich] Would anyone really take issue with that? 
  [Golovnev] It is hard to take issue with it. Consequently, 
we have no shortage of statesmen who have been campaigning -- 
like Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Federal Assembly's upper 
house, has been doing in your newspaper (the 5 April issue -- 
G.M.) -- for the "Army to have everything as a priority." 
  But stating the truth is not enough. Army training and, 
consequently, the might of the fatherland will not improve 
because of that. The situation will change depending on how 
soon the state can bring the Armed Forces up to full strength. 
We need to be talking today not simply about replenishing the 
thinning Army ranks with illiterate workers and peasants or 
"ignoramuses" who had never studied or worked anywhere before 
being drafted. It is a question of the need to revive the 
intellectual level of the barracks, which is now lower in this 
country than in the United States and some other NATO countries. 
And that, you understand, will take more than just one draft 
intake. And not only the draft intake.... 
  A great deal will depend on how soon we introduce a viable 
organizational and staffing structure for combined and other 
units. On how soon our financing stops being dependent on all 
kinds of chance circumstances. On how soon viable logistical 
subunits appear in the forces. And so on and so forth. 
  In no way does this mean that we, the military, are beyond 
reproach. We also need to look at how responsible and 
conscientiously we approach the task in hand, how enterprising 
we are, and so forth. Incidentally, commanders have now been 
given a free hand, they are being allowed to plan the training 
process with an eye to local conditions. 
  It is time to seriously deal with the problems of combat 
training within the framework of moral and psychological backup 
for Armed Forces activity. 
  [Miranovich] Incidentally, this was intensively discussed at 
the scientific and theoretical conference held recently at the 
General Staff Academy. 
  [Golovnev] Yes, we need questing in this area. For 
well-known reasons we currently, as before, have no powerful 
ideological backup for combat training. At the same time, we 
need to somehow highlight such philosophical and moral values as 
the conviction of the need for a strong Russian state, and the 
understanding that military men cannot make such a clear impact 
anywhere in peacetime as they can in combat training. 
  [Miranovich] Perhaps we should learn from the West? After 
all, many armies have already been through what we are currently 
experiencing. 
  [Golovnev] A great deal has changed in our relationships 
with 
Western armies, including NATO armies. We have more contact. 
For instance, last year students from the United States and 
France visited the Moscow Combined Arms College. Students from 
the St. Petersburg Higher Combined Arms Command College hosted 
their counterparts from Belgium, and are now getting ready to 
travel there themselves on an exchange. Officers from Sweden 
are studying in a number of our academies. There are also 
direct contacts with the troops. The most vivid example is 
probably the exercises due in June between the headquarters of 
our 27th Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S. 3d Infantry 
Division -- preparations for which are now actively in hand. 
  What does this experience show? It can be said that the 
general trend in Armed Forces combat training in the leading 
states is now to reduce (the figures are cited -- G.M.) the 
number of large-scale exercises and maneuvers involving actual 
forces. 
  We are striving to do the same thing. For instance, we now 
plan no more than two exercises a year with companies and 
battalions. One of those will be a live-fire exercise. 
Regimental and divisional exercises are not held annually, as 
used to be the case, but biennially. But.... 
  Whereas, so to speak, we have been forced into this, the 
NATO 
Joint Armed Forces command has different motives. It prefers to 
resolve many traditional training tasks and to study the 
questions of training and warfare under new geostrategic 
conditions using automated battlefield modeling systems. How 
effective are they? Judge for yourselves -- the use of automated 
battlefield modeling terminals at fixed-site and field command 
and control centers and during the U.S. "Certain Caravan" 
exercises in Europe made it possible to carry out large-scale 
military operations involving around 200,000 servicemen and more 
than 25,000 units of armored equipment. 
  [Miranovich] Do we have nothing similar? 
  [Golovnev] What is annoying is that we do [to-to i obidno, 
chto yest]. Our laser firing and engagement simulators 
[lazernyye imitatory strelby i porazheniya] have proved their 
worth superbly. They make it possible to simulate fire from 
tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and small arms, and to record 
"kills" on both sides in two-sided field training exercises. 
But for all this to work and for the reduction in the number of 
very costly live-fire exercises (figures for 1991 cited -- G.M.) 
not to be to the detriment of troop training, we need a 
comprehensively automated tactical training system. 
  The Americans use such a system at their specialized 
training 
centers. We also have one in the pipeline, so to speak. With 
its help the training process could be made immeasurably 
cheaper. But, once again, it all depends on money. 
  [Miranovich] Anatoliy Andreyevich, the retargeting of the 
Armed Forces -- if I can put it that way -- to focus on 
resolving the new tasks stemming from the new 
military-political, geostrategic, and other realities will 
require, apart from anything else, a corresponding theoretical 
basis for their training. For instance, special tactical 
leadership had to be developed for the joint command-post 
exercise between Russian and U.S. peacekeeping forces to which 
you referred. And what about our field manuals, which are also 
probably obsolete, and other documents regulating troop 
training? After all, different types of training are clearly 
needed for men in ordinary divisions and peacekeeping divisions, 
for new recruits and experienced specialists, for men entering 
service under contract, and for women.... 
  [Golovnev] Yes, our current field manuals have been in 
operation since 1989. But I would not say that they were 
hopelessly outdated. After all, changes in tactics are, as is 
well known, the result of certain breakthroughs in technical 
development, and are a kind of reaction to certain innovations 
in armed combat systems. If we proceed on this basis, then the 
current manuals can still be used for training -- which is, 
indeed, what practice shows. At the same time, directives have 
been issued making certain clarifications connected with Armed 
Forces reform and the change of normative acts on defense issues 
-- specifically to Part 1 (divisions, brigades, regiments) of 
the Ground Forces Field Manual. The chapters entitled 
"Foundations of the Soviet Military Doctrine" and "Political 
Work" have been removed from the manual. A chapter entitled 
"Moral and Psychological Backup" has been brought in, along with 
clarifications connected with certain aspects of provision. The 
place and role of new Ground Force formations -- motorized rifle 
and tank brigades -- in combined-arms combat have been defined. 
Normative indicators have been set for them. Moreover, it has 
been decided to rework formal documents containing regulations 
in 1994-1995 -- something that a special commission is currently 
at work on. 
  As for the features of training different categories of 
servicemen, here we proceed on the basis of a single ultimate 
goal -- the readiness of subunits to fulfill their combat 
mission in all types of combat irrespective of the manpower 
acquisition principle used. Individual training has been 
introduced for those serving under contract. One or two days a 
month are given over to it. It is worth noting that the 
planning for individual training also takes account of the level 
of subunits' training, questions on which further work should be 
done, and...requests from the contract servicemen themselves. 
Individual training exercises mainly employ drills, group 
exercises, and practical work. 
  As to women.... There is nothing special about their 
training. They train according to their speciality within a 
subunit or training group. In other words, however 
heterogeneous the military may be, the aim of training remains 
unchanged -- to teach people what they need in warfare.

<F P=106> [Article by Candidate of Naval Sciences, Retired </F>
Admiral Nikolay Nikolayevich Amelko, under the rubric: "Time and 
the Navy": "The Russian Navy's Structural Development 
Problems"] 
  [Text] Concern with regard to the current state of 
the Russian Navy and its future, especially on the threshold of 
the 300th anniversary of the native navy, prompts many people to 
express, through the mass media, their points of view on the 
resolution of the problems of its preservation and 
development. 
  We offer for your attention the opinion of Retired 
Admiral N.N. Amelko on a series of aspects of this problem. 
Admiral Amelko commanded the Pacific Fleet from 1962-1969, was 
Navy deputy commander-in-chief from 1969-1978, and was deputy 
chief of the General Staff of the USSR Armed Forces for the Navy 
from 1978-1988. It is possible that not all of the conclusions 
and suggestions of the author of this article are indisputable 
but Nikolay Nikolayevich's sincere interest in preserving a 
strong Russian Navy and also his many years of service 
experience make the position he is defending worthy of special 
attention. 
  At the present time, the issues of the development of the 
Russian Navy are acquiring greater urgency and the attention 
that our professional magazine is paying to them is not 
surprising. Other magazines, newspapers and television are also 
broaching this topic, although not always thoroughly and 
frequently in the well-known combination of "the Army and Navy". 
  To my great regret, even in such an important government 
document as the presentation of "Osnovnyye polozheniya voyennoy 
doktriny Rossiyskoy Federatsii" [The Main Provisions of Russian 
Federation Military Doctrine], one small paragraph is devoted to 
the Navy which prescribes: "Step up the dialog on the 
preparation and adoption of effective international agreements 
in the sphere of the reduction of naval forces and weapons and 
the limitation of naval activity".[.sup]1[/] And that is 
everything that concerns the Navy. 
  Admittedly, this is only a presentation of the doctrine and 
maybe there is something in the full text about our Navy's role, 
place, and missions in the defense and protection of Russia's 
interests, otherwise we can understand that paragraph as the 
intention to eliminate the Navy in general as a service of the 
Armed Forces. Moreover, the impression is being created that the 
Government and the president have no advisors on the Navy's 
problems and they are not being seriously dealt with. We know 
that the president had an advisor on military issues -- former 
Deputy Chief of the Main Political Directorate for Ideology, 
Colonel-General D.A. Volkogonov -- whose competence in the 
operational-strategic issues of the employment of the Armed 
Forces and, all the more so their component -- the Navy -- is 
very doubtful. 
  Currently, many of the country's leaders, including the 
minister of defense, visit our fleets but we haven't heard or 
read about the results of their visits, assessments of the state 
and current activities of naval forces, perhaps with the 
exception of the establishment of the serious housing situation 
for seamen and especially statements on the prospects for their 
development. In this context, we cannot pass over in silence the 
presentation of this magazine correspondent's interview with 
First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Afanasyevich Kokoshin 
that appeared in MORSKOY SBORNIK No 11, 1993, which was titled 
"Rossii nuzhen dostoynyy ee flot" [Russia Needs a Proper Navy]. 
A number of the thoughts expressed in the responses to the 
correspondent were perceived with great surprise by myself as a 
veteran who devoted 57 years to service in the Navy and as a 
participant of two wars, yes and by many of my colleagues. 
Obviously, we need to perceive what A.A. Kokoshin said as the 
views of the Ministry of Defense leadership on our Navy's 
present and future. 
  In my opinion, the main thing in the interview was the 
presentation of the missions that the Navy must be ready to 
accomplish for the purpose of Russia's security and defense. It 
appears to us that the missions were correctly set forth and, 
indeed, we would like for them to have been worded not in such 
general terms but in more specific terms. 
  However, there is something contained in A.A. Kokoshin's 
responses that puts us on guard. I was especially concerned by 
A.A. Kokoshin's statement: "I would not say that we have a new 
shipbuilding program in its traditional sense. I think that 
there must be a weapons development program on the whole where 
the Navy will be a component". It's obvious that the 
understanding of this component was engendered by an 
underestimation of the Navy's role in the system of defense and 
protection of Russia's interests under contemporary conditions, 
its complexity and essence. This is confirmed by other 
statements: "... Due to our geostrategic position, we 
traditionally are more a land than a naval power, yes and 
Russia's military fate, as a rule, has been decided on land". 
The reason why adequate attention is not being devoted to the 
Navy in the current military doctrine is certainly contained in 
these two quotes. 
  I don't know if it is worth repeating that Russia's maritime 
border is approximately 40,000 kilometers which is more than two 
times its land border and more than the coast line of all of 
Europe and we also need to protect and, when necessary, defend 
this border. Or recall the rapidly increasing significance of 
the continental shelf, maritime economic zones, etc., the 
protection of which is becoming a very important mission just 
like ensuring safety of navigation and fishing. Consequently, 
the statement that Russia is more a land than a naval power is 
not only groundless but also contains a distortion of Russia's 
geostrategic position and a disparagement of our Navy's role. 
  We can agree with the fact that Russia's military fate, as a 
rule, has been decided on land. But we must not forget that in 
all wars the Navy was not only the Army's loyal assistant but 
also an active participant of many joint, with ground troops and 
aviation, battles for the sake of victory. To disparage the 
Navy's role and significance -- means to cancel out its 300-year 
history and to forget its achievements under the leadership of 
Peter I, Spiridov, Ushakov, Senyavin, Lazarev, Nakhimov, Essen, 
Kuznetsov, and to forget its innovators and the discoverers of 
new lands. We must also remember that during the Great Patriotic 
War the Navy conducted 105 different amphibious assault landings 
and that all enemy-occupied ports and coastal cities were seized 
by the enemy not from the sea but from land. Recall the Navy's 
role in defending and lifting the blockade of Leningrad, and the 
defense of Odessa, Sevastopol and Zapolarye. The Northern 
Fleet's provision of escorts for allied convoys. The fact that 
our ships, submarines, naval aviation, and coastal artillery 
destroyed 1,245 combatants and auxiliary ships and 1,307 
transport ships of Fascist Germany and its allies during the 
war. The enemy's irretrievable losses on them totaled thousands 
of seamen, soldiers and officers, hundreds of thousands of 
weapons and tonnes of strategic cargoes. 
  Despite the warming of relations between the former 
irreconcilable enemies on the whole, all kinds of military 
conflicts have not subsided in the world in the contemporary 
international situation. NATO is maintaining and expanding its 
activity as a military organization which is even replacing the 
UN Security Council's Military Committee and is attempting to 
resolve emerging conflict situations using arms and sometimes 
even outside the bloc's zone and without taking into account the 
opinions of the members of the UN Security Council itself. 
Therefore, it is extremely rash to assert that there is no 
threat -- if not of war, than of the emergence of armed 
conflicts into which Russia and the other CIS countries could be 
drawn. 
  At the same time, the experience of all of the latest most 
serious conflicts points toward an increase of the significance 
of the operations of aviation and naval forces in them which 
attests to the increase of the danger precisely from the 
maritime axes. In an article published in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on 
8 February 1994, the author criticizes our military doctrine 
because it does not indicate a specific enemy against whom we 
are creating the armed forces. But do we need to repeat previous 
errors? In my view, we must not seek specific enemies but build 
the armed forces from the calculation that they could appear 
from any direction. And because we must put a stop to any 
infringement on the sovereignty and integrity of Russia and the 
CIS countries, we must be ready to accomplish that mission 
because it is simply impossible to restructure anything, 
especially the Navy, in a short period of time. 
  Proceeding from what has been stated above, in my opinion, 
it 
is advisable to word our Navy's missions as follows: 
  1. Ensuring the security of Russia and the CIS countries 
from 
the naval axes. In my view, we must consider the primary danger 
to be strikes by sea-launched long-range cruise missiles, the 
platforms of which are surface combatants and submarines. Today, 
this is the Tomahawk sea-launched long-range cruise missile with 
a launch range of approximately 3,000 kilometers. This permits 
them to destroy targets located on the European territory of 
Russia to the Urals, all targets in Belorussia [Belarus], 
Ukraine, Moldova, North Caucasus, and Central Asia during 
launches from the Barents, Norwegian and Mediterranean seas, 
from the North Atlantic and even from the Indian Ocean. From the 
areas of the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean 
-- all targets of Russia to the Irkutsk meridian. Carrier-based 
and strategic aviation are another danger from the maritime 
axes. We can compare the destruction radius of carrier-based 
aircraft, especially with the utilization of airfields of 
contiguous states upon their return with the launch range of 
sea-launched long-range cruise missiles and even strategic 
aviation. 
  The most effective weapon to repel sea-launched long-range 
cruise missile and carrier-based aviation strikes -- is to bring 
pressure to bear against their platforms and only an effective 
Navy, that has been deployed during the threatened period in the 
detected areas of their combat maneuvering, is capable of 
combating them. 
  2. Constant maintenance of naval strategic nuclear forces at 
a high degree of readiness. Considering their very important 
function of deterring aggression, paramount attention must be 
devoted to ensuring their high combat readiness, the reliability 
of command and control and disseminating combat command and 
control signals, and also the defense of basing and dispersal 
areas and patrol areas because they become the "number 1" 
targets of destruction with the initiation of combat operations. 
  3. Defense of external and internal maritime lines of 
communications and other economic and scientific activity in 
remote areas of the seas and oceans. Here lately, isn't it 
strange, the struggle with piracy on the high seas is once again 
becoming urgent and, according to data of the London Center for 
Combating Piracy, in the first half of 1993 alone, of the 83 
attacks against civilian ships that were taken into account, 24 
attacks were against Russian ships. 
  4. Participation of some of our fleet forces in peacekeeping 
actions based upon UN Security Council decisions to put a stop 
to armed conflicts. 
  All of the indicated missions for the defense of Russian and 
the CIS states from the maritime axes are timely even today. 
Their accomplishment requires daily readiness and aggressive 
activity from our fleets because only they are capable of 
accomplishing them with the required effectiveness. And to do 
that we need a "proper" navy and not only in support of Russia 
but also in support of all of the Commonwealth of Independent 
States. It seems to me that today the need for the creation of 
Unified Naval Forces in support of the CIS, with shared 
participation in this matter of all Commonwealth countries, is 
already quite obvious because practically all of them separately 
are incapable of creating modern, even if small, national naval 
forces or of maintaining them. Incidentally, I did not make a 
slip of the tongue when I employed the term "Yedinyye 
Voyenno-Morskiye Sily SNG" [CIS Unified Naval Forces]. All the 
same a navy is only ships, submarines and support ships. 
However, today besides that, it also has at its disposal naval 
aviation, coastal missile and artillery units, naval infantry 
and coastal defense units, and also arsenals, ship repair plants 
and shops, engineer units and rear services organs. Therefore, 
currently the Navy, besides the weapons that are purely specific 
for it, has at its disposal practically all of the weapons that 
the other services of the Armed Forces have which makes its 
Naval Forces designation more correct. 
  I am in total agreement with A.A. Kokoshin that we don't 
need 
"traditional shipbuilding programs" in that sense and with those 
approaches as we previously understood them. We should have long 
ago oriented ourselves on the development of integrated combat 
systems that organically combine ships of various classes, their 
weapons and support systems which, incidentally, Navy 
specialists have dreamed of for years. Then we would not have 
that large collection of ship and submarine designs, types of 
weapons for them and other similar shortcomings. But along with 
that, while considering the technical complexity of the 
structure of the Navy, we need not a separate component of 
common weapons but an independent "Naval Forces Development 
Program" that meets the new conditions. In the process, 
specialists --naval professionals -- must be involved with its 
development, the Russian Government must approve it and the CIS 
Heads of State Council must approve it for the Unified Naval 
Forces. 
  During the course of this work, each design for a ship, 
weapons system or support system must be based upon its need, 
compatibility and, of course, "cost-effectiveness" criteria. But 
to prevent a return to the customary past, the approval of 
decisions on these issues must occur at the Governmental level 
based on the conclusions of an independent committee of experts. 
We must enlist the appropriate naval experts, practitioners at 
the level of commanders of fleets and flotillas, both active 
commanders and those who held these posts in the past, and also 
scientists, designers, manufacturers and other experts in the 
work of the committee of experts, only they must mandatorily be 
independent of those departments which have vested interests in 
obtaining more expensive, and therefore profitable, orders that 
do not always satisfy the Navy as this frequently occurred in 
the past. A small team of consultants on naval affairs could be 
formed from them, the absence of which is already being felt. 
Its functions must include the organization of that independent 
committee of experts and preparation of findings and the 
appropriate governmental decrees based upon it... 
  As for ships, submarines, and naval weapons, here obviously 
the reduction of their noise level and weight and dimensions 
specifications of all systems, the development of missile ships 
on new maintenance principles merit the most rapt attention. We 
already had these designs and experimental models but some of 
them were discarded as unprofitable for the Ministry of the 
Shipbuilding Industry. The development of a low-noise nuclear 
multi-mission [mnogotselevaya] submarine (it is precisely a 
multi-mission submarine) is required in order to rid ourselves 
of multiple types of ships when a separate design was developed 
and built for each mission and their number reached two dozen in 
the fleets. There is also a similar situation with surface 
combatants. A ship with a displacement of 5,000-10,000 tonnes 
must be both missile, antisubmarine warfare, convoy and escort. 
Multiple types of ships dramatically increase expenditures both 
during construction and during operation. The 
military-industrial complex, and especially the Ministry of the 
Shipbuilding Industry, were interested in a large number of 
increasingly new designs because they received colossal bonuses 
and thousands of awards for each of them and the highest leaders 
of departments even received the rank of Heroes of the Soviet 
Union or Heroes of Socialist Labor. 
  A.A. Kokoshin correctly states that, while considering our 
state's serious economic situation, we need to rationally spend 
even minimally allocated resources. Unfortunately, we still 
haven't rid ourselves of mismanagement and we even encounter 
outright thievery. He correctly tasks our fleets with the 
mission for the next 2-3 years -- this is a struggle for 
survival. We understand that today there is no possibility to 
allocate appropriations for the Navy based upon the actual need. 
But at the same time, the Navy must not be doomed to 
"self-survival" in order for it to survive. Preservation Of the 
Navy is a task not only for the Navy or the Ministry of Defense 
themselves but also for both the Government and the president.

<F P=106> [Article by Naval Main Staff First Deputy Chief, </F>
Vice Admiral Yu. Kaysin, under the rubric: "Questions of 
Theory": "Developing Naval Command and Control Theory"] 
  [Text] The Navy's combat readiness is formed in peacetime 
and its improvement is a continuous process. In the process, the 
underestimation of just one of the elements of combat readiness 
can result in such consequences that are at times impossible to 
correct during the course of a war. Proceeding from that, the 
Navy's leadership is making heightened requirements to the 
activities of commanding generals, commanders and staffs in this 
sphere. 
  The capability of command and control organs to bring 
themselves and subordinate units to readiness to accomplish 
combat missions in a timely manner and also the skill of 
commanding generals, commanders and staffs to firmly command and 
control subordinate forces during the course of preparing for 
and conducting military operations is one of the primary 
elements of naval forces combat readiness. Military history 
knows quite a few examples when units or formations, that had a 
powerful combat potential, lost battles and engagements to an 
enemy who was equal in forces and sometimes weaker precisely due 
to the absence of operational, continuous and reliable command 
and control. 
  Our Navy's operations on 22 June 1941 serve as a positive 
example. Having manifested vigilance and based upon information 
obtained on the change of the operational situation at sea and 
in the air, the Navy's command authorities issued the order to 
shift fleet forces to full combat readiness several hours prior 
to the enemy attack which permitted them to successfully repel a 
surprise attack. As a result, on the first day of the war, our 
Navy did not lose a single ship or aircraft. 
  The experience of the latest local wars and armed conflicts 
also objectively confirms the need to prepare the command and 
control system for the complex conditions of entry into war. So, 
according to foreign press information, during the course of 
Israeli Armed Forces aggression into Lebanon (in 1982), the 
Israelis managed to reveal the Syrian troop formations' command 
and control and communications system which permitted them to 
conduct accurate strikes against the revealed targets already at 
the beginning of the conflict. As a result, they managed to 
completely or partially disrupt command and control of Syrian 
troops, their aviation and air defense systems. 
  In the Persian Gulf, during the first two weeks of combat 
operations of the United States and its allies against the Iraqi 
Armed Forces, approximately 25 percent of the command and 
control organs were destroyed and 50 percent were rendered 
inoperable which permitted them to practically paralyze the 
Iraqi Armed Forces command and control system and to 
dramatically reduce coalition forces losses. It is 
characteristic that one of the reasons that caused the defeat of 
the Argentine Armed Forces in the Falklands (Malvinas) Islands 
(1981) were the shortcomings of their command and control system 
that reduced the reliability and stability of the leadership of 
combat operations. 
  All of this attests to the need to maintain the command and 
control system at a high degree of combat readiness during 
peacetime and to ensure its transition beforehand to combat 
readiness when a threat emerges and also its role in the 
attainment of victory in wartime. 
<H8>  Definition of Command and Control Theory </H8>
  The content of military practice has perceptibly expanded 
under contemporary conditions. The significance of military 
theory has also correspondingly increased. Therefore, the role 
of military scientific research and also the significance of the 
timeliness of the introduction of their results into the 
practice of military structural development have substantially 
increased. We know that theory sheds light on the path of 
practice and practice is the driving force and the goal of the 
development of theory. 
  Naval theory -- this is the system of scientific knowledge 
that reveals the laws and patterns of armed combat at sea, the 
principles of structural development of the Navy, its 
preparation and employment in the system of the armed forces 
both during the course of a war and also during peacetime. While 
defining the prospects and directions of naval development on a 
scientific basis, it is a part of military science and is in 
subordinate dependence to it. In turn, naval command and control 
theory permeates all of the elements of naval theory. 
  In the Soviet Military Encyclopedia, the concept of ground 
(naval) forces command and control is interpreted as the 
activity of commanding generals (commanders, superiors), staffs, 
services and other command and control organs for the 
maintenance of the combat readiness and combat capability of 
ground (naval) forces, preparation of operations and combat 
operations and their leadership while accomplishing the assigned 
missions. At the same time, it indicates that in a broader sense 
troop command and control encompasses all of the activity of 
strategic leadership, commanding generals (commanders, 
superiors), and staffs both for command and control in a combat 
situation and also for the development and combat improvement of 
ground (naval) forces, the organization of operational and 
combat training and service of the troops, maintenance of 
discipline and high moral spirit of personnel, and ensuring 
continuous combat and mobilization readiness of the troops 
(naval forces). 
  However, in our view, we must examine command and control 
theory as one of the components of military science that has an 
independent sphere of research that is based upon the common 
laws and principles of command and control of the Armed Forces. 
In the process, the provisions of naval command and control 
theory certainly must take into account and reflect the specific 
features of the Navy while resolving the missions of armed 
combat at sea and in turn be part of all of the components of 
naval theory. So, its own private theory, that takes into 
account the specific nature of this activity, is being developed 
based upon the general provisions of command and control theory. 
  From what has been stated above, we can arrive at the 
conclusion that contemporary naval forces command and control 
theory must be developed as naval command and control theory on 
the whole. Let's dwell on this in more detail. 
  In our view, the activity of the command authorities and 
command and control organs during preparation of the Navy for 
the armed defense of the state and the employment of forces 
during the course of military operations, that are being 
conducted both independently and also jointly with other 
services of the Armed Forces, is the object of study of this 
theory. Its subject are the laws, patterns, principles and 
categories of command and control, the organized forms and 
methods of functioning of the naval command and control system 
under various conditions and while accomplishing various 
missions with the employment of contemporary technical command 
and control systems. 
  The structure of naval command and control theory must 
examine all of the specific features of the peculiarities of 
command and control of forces while preparing for and conducting 
operations and combat operations, the management of 
construction, operational, combat, moral-psychological training 
and education of personnel, and also scientific research and 
other types of naval activity. In our view, it consists of the 
following elements: the foundations of naval command and 
control, command and control organs, systems and equipment, and 
organization and methods of command and control. The laws and 
principles of the science of command and control of the state 
and the Armed Forces, that are being employed while taking into 
account the specific nature of the missions, organization, and 
forms of utilization of naval forces, are its methodological 
basis, like all other sciences. Furthermore, it broadly utilizes 
the information of the natural and technical sciences, based 
upon which the continuous improvement of command and control 
methods and systems is being carried out. 
<H8>  Development of Naval Forces Command and Control Theory </H8>
  The art of command and control of naval forces had already 
emerged in ancient times. We know that in the 5th Century B.C. 
ships in the Greek Navy had already been formed into detachments 
for convenience of command and control in battle and the naval 
commander had several assistants which we can consider to be the 
beginning of the birth of the organization of command and 
control of forces. It was improved over the course of many 
centuries along with the development of naval forces and naval 
battle tactics. The first naval charter of 1720, in which the 
combat experience of ship operations in the Northern War was 
summarized, played a large role in the establishment in our 
country of the theory and practice of command and control of 
naval forces. The appearance of a steam-powered navy required 
the development of both new tactics and also the organization of 
the command and control of its forces. Headquarters of 
formations were created in the Russian Navy in the 1880's as a 
result of the increase of the volume of command and control 
functions. 
  The introduction of the radio became revolutionary in the 
matter of the command and control of naval forces. So, the 
experience of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 pointed out 
that command and control had attained the significance of an 
important factor that determines the attainment of victory in 
armed combat at sea and its excessive centralization and Vice 
Admiral Rozhestvenskiy's underestimation of the capabilities of 
command and control using radio were noted among the causes of 
the defeat of the 2nd Pacific Squadron in the Battle of 
Tsushima. Furthermore, the absence of a full-fledged staff under 
the commanding general had a negative impact on the quality of 
command and control of forces during this battle. 
  After the Russo-Japanese War, the question on the 
reorganization of the naval leadership staff was urgently 
raised. In 1906, the Naval General Staff was created with the 
functions of operational-strategic leadership of the Navy 
because the Main Naval Staff that had existed prior to this was 
involved only with administrative-management activities. 
  During the course of the First World War, objective 
conditions for the emergence of a new form of combat activity of 
the fleet -- the naval operation -- developed as a result of the 
appearance of new branches of forces (submarines and aviation) 
and the increased scale of combat operations at sea. Its 
introduction into the practice of armed combat at sea began to 
be implemented thanks to the increased capabilities of fleet and 
staff commanding generals for command and control of forces at 
great distances using radio communications and also for planning 
large-scale operations with the involvement of operational staff 
organs. 
  The expansion of the missions, the qualitative and 
quantitative composition of the Navy, the forms of its combat 
employment, and the introduction of new technical systems 
rendered a substantial influence on the development of naval 
forces command and control techniques. Having absorbed the 
accumulated domestic and foreign experience of command and 
control of forces in the First World War and the Civil War, the 
theory and practice of command and control of forces found its 
expression in an entire series of interim guidance and 
instructions and, in 1925, in the first postwar general military 
regulation. 
  Furthermore, the military reform of 1924-1925, having 
affected all spheres of activity of the Armed Forces, resulted 
in the reorganization of the central staff. One-man command was 
introduced and special research was conducted to improve command 
and control of forces at all levels. In 1937, the People's 
Commissariat of the Navy was formed for the direct leadership of 
fleet forces. On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, it 
introduced a number of documents that regulated the combat 
activities of the fleets and contained requirements and 
recommendations for planning and organizing combat operations 
and the leadership of their conduct. The war years were an 
important stage in the improvement and development of the naval 
forces command and control system and principles. The provisions 
of command and control theory underwent combat verification. 
Much attention was devoted to summarizing and disseminating 
combat experience in those years. In the process, the new 
dimensions of the nature of fleet operations during the course 
of the Second World War had an impact on the development of the 
theory and practice of command and control of forces, the most 
important of which were: 
  the spatial scale that encompassed enormous spheres of the 
seas and oceans with active combat; 
  the increase of the role of the most universal branches of 
fleet forces --submarines and aviation (especially, 
carrier-based aviation) in armed combat; 
  the increase of the significance in attaining the common 
goal 
of joint operations of the Army and Navy, their coordination in 
defensive and offensive operations (which found its expression, 
in particular, in the increase of the number of amphibious 
assault landings), during which the fleets were operationally 
subordinated to the troop coastal combined formations or the 
creation of a single command authority was stipulated, joint 
development of combat documents was conducted by staffs, command 
and control was organized from a single or closely-located 
command posts, the exchange of staffs by operational groups, 
etc.; and, 
  the increase of the number of major naval operations and 
engagements, especially with the participation of carrier-based 
strike formations. 
  During the course of the Great Patriotic and Second World 
wars, the staffs of various echelons and other command and 
control organs, radio communications and situation coverage 
systems received significant development. The experience of 
these wars and the new trends of development of the theory and 
practice of command and control of naval forces lay at the 
foundation of the resolution of the problems of the leadership 
of the activities of the fleets right up to the end of the 
1950's. During subsequent years, the leading naval powers, 
including our country, developed qualitatively new ocean navies 
based upon the achievements of science and the 
military-technical revolution and modern and fundamentally new 
command and control systems were deployed to realize the combat 
potential of these ocean navies. 
<H8>  Naval Forces Command and Control Theory at the Current Stage </H8>
  The history of navies, like military history on the whole, 
does not provide and cannot provide prepared recipes for the 
resolution of today's problems. Its main value is in the 
capability to reveal the general patterns of development and to 
provide a scientific analysis of the phenomena of past wars and 
to extract object lessons from them. 
  Under contemporary conditions, various types of automated 
command and control systems, using special software, are being 
widely utilized for the collection, analysis and transmission of 
information. This permits them to shift to the automation of the 
most important process of command and control -- working out a 
decision. If a decision is the meaty basis of command and 
control, the command and control system, the main elements of 
which are command and control organs and facilities, 
communications and automated command and control systems, and 
also the system for extracting and gathering information on the 
situation, serves as its material basis at the present time. 
  Automation of the command and control of forces is normally 
understood to be the process of developing and realizing the 
required system of technical equipment that permit accomplishing 
certain command and control functions automatically, without the 
participation of man in command and control organs (staffs and 
command posts). Actually, at the present time it does not appear 
to be possible to effectively control many spheres of activity, 
including naval forces, without utilizing automated command and 
control systems. But nevertheless man still remains the main 
figure in the command and control process. Really command and 
control is first and foremost anticipation. Machines can only 
ease and accelerate the process but are presently incapable of 
replacing the creativity of the intellect. 
  The decision made by the commanding general (commander) is 
the basis of command and control of forces. Command and control 
is structured on its basis and must ensure effective utilization 
of the combat capabilities of forces and successful 
accomplishment of missions by them within the prescribed time 
periods under any conditions of the situation. Therefore, 
unswerving observance of the principle -- teach staffs and naval 
forces what is required in war -- as before is the main 
requirement made toward the activities of commanding generals, 
commanders, staffs and command and control organs during the 
planning, organization and conduct of operational and combat 
training measures. 
  The existing structure of the naval forces command and 
control system, which was developed in peacetime and includes 
the command and control organs and facilities, communications 
and situation coverage systems, and also automated command and 
control systems, permits us to accomplish the important 
functions of supporting the conduct of combat operations. It's 
obvious that, on the one hand, under all conditions the system 
must ensure stable, uninterrupted, operational and concealed 
command and control of its own forces and, on the other hand, 
provide the capability to carry out disruption of the enemy 
forces and weapons command and control systems by employing men 
and equipment to disable enemy command and control facilities, 
communications hubs, navigation systems, etc, or to achieve 
disruptions in their operation. 
  However, it is not simple to accomplish all of these 
missions. At the present time, there is an objective need to 
increase the quality of all training of command and control 
facilities because its shortcomings reduce the quality of the 
assessment of the situation which, in turn, does not promote the 
correct prediction of its development. In the process, this can 
result not because people are unskilled but because the existing 
direction of their training and also the level of organization 
of coordination of command and control facilities combat crews 
does not always promote success in operations in a specific 
situation. 
  While considering what has been stated above, steps have 
already been taken in the fleets to increase the quality of 
training for the command and control of forces but there still 
remains a significant sphere for initiative. In the process, in 
our view, first of all we need a scientific approach to the 
problem of improving the combat training of command and control 
facilities, the goal of which must become increasing the combat 
readiness level of the entire command and control system and its 
capability to withstand any unpleasant situations under the most 
varied conditions. Here, in our opinion, along with the 
resolution of a number of technical problems, we need to 
increase the quality of individual training of officers of 
command and control facilities, to precisely ascertain the list 
of methodological and guiding documents that regulate training 
for command and control of forces and the performance of 
operational alert duty and also the selection of the most 
optimal organizational forms of training utilizing computer 
systems. 
  Developed at the end of the 1980's, the naval forces command 
and control system corresponded to the composition, structure 
and missions being accomplished and on the whole supported 
command and control of naval forces and also combat and 
operational training of forces and staffs. In the process, the 
primary provisions of the new military doctrine on the whole did 
not affect the principles of its formation. Analysis of the 
operational training inspections and measures that were 
conducted in the 1993 training year indicated that, despite a 
number of deficiencies that were revealed, the Navy's command 
and control organs are capable of accomplishing the assigned 
missions. However, the change of the state borders partially 
affected the effectiveness of the Navy's command and control 
system. At the present time, the command and control organs 
themselves have also been subjected to a substantial 
reorganization and experience shows that a drastic reduction and 
change of the structures of command and control organs has 
always been reflected in the qualitative indicators of their 
functioning. We must also take into account the fact that the 
entire load of work not only for the command and control of 
forces but also for the reorganization lies on the command and 
control organs. 
  Moreover, at the present time we can precisely see the naval 
powers' navies' increasing role in maintaining peace and 
stability, accomplishing peacekeeping functions, conducting 
foreign policy actions under the aegis of the United Nations, 
rendering assistance to the population in emergency situations, 
etc. This, in turn, entails the need for a comprehensive 
analysis and rethinking of a number of directions in the 
training of command and control organs. With the increased 
probability of the outbreak of regional conflicts, in this 
training we need officers to expand their study of the 
political, economic, and social processes that are occurring in 
these regions. 
  Here we have touched upon only the most general issues that 
are associated with the development of naval forces command and 
control theory. We would like for the chiefs of staff of all 
levels to participate in the development of its individual 
issues and to share the experience that has been accumulated in 
the process on the pages of the press. This will certainly 
promote the strengthening of the Navy's combat readiness.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Gromak under "The State: Words and </F>
Deeds" rubric: "For Sale After Being Under Arrest?: the Russian 
Oceanographic Fleet May Lose a Unique Research Ship"] 
  [Text] After fortunately escaping seizure in the port 
of Las Palmas (Canary Islands), the research ship "Akademik 
Sergey Vavilov" returned to its home shores. But in Port Stanley 
(Falkland Islands), another research ship, the "Akademik Ioffe," 
which also belongs to the Institute of Oceanography imeni P.P. 
Shirshov of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has been under 
arrest since 17 March as a hostage for the "Vavilov" that 
"slipped away." However, the story of the seizure of one ship 
and the "escape" of another began long before the unpleasant 
outcome for the Russian side and it is not yet over. 
  Just a few years ago research ships of this class performed 
an enormous amount of work in the study of the world oceans, 
including in the interests of the Russian Navy. For example, it 
was only because of the unique equipment and efforts of the 
command of the research ship "Akademik Mstislav Keldysh" that it 
was possible to clarify the situation with respect to the 
nuclear submarine "Komsomoletz" lying on the bottom of the sea. 
For well-known reasons, however, today it is practically 
impossible to maintain the unique fleet and to carry out 
research through the means of the state budget only. Last year, 
therefore, the Institute of Oceanography of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences leased the reseach ship "Akademik Sergey Vavilov" to 
the Russian-German joint enterprise "Polar Shipping" out of St. 
Petersburg for a period of five years for tourist cruises. Under 
the contract, the charterer had the right to make tourist 
cruises and to obtain an income from this activity under that 
condition that the charterer will assume all of the expenditures 
for the maintenance of the ship, including material-technical 
supply, the cost of fuel, the payment of the crew, and 
registered repairs. As payment for the five-year lease, the 
company "Polar Shipping" obligated itself to pay the 
expenditures of two scientific expeditions on this ship for 100 
days each and costing $400,000. 
  But after just six months of operations, the company refused 
to finance the first expedition. Moreover, in the period from 
the 8th through the 15th of November of last year in the port of 
Bremerhaven (Germany), a German firm carried out a repair of the 
research ship "Akademik Sergey Vavilov" for the sum of 338,800 
German marks [DM]. The company "Polar Shipping" assigned an 
intermediary firm to perform work in connection with the 
repairs, but when it came time to settle accounts there was no 
one to pay. On 15 December of last year, the Institute of 
Oceanography canceled the contract with the joint enterprise 
"Polar Shipping." Not having contract relations with the 
representative of the German intermediary firm, the institute 
naturally could not control his actions and the institute did 
not sanction the servicing of the ship on credit. 
  Meanwhile, the German creditor companies, despairing of the 
prospects of somehow getting back the funds invested in the 
repairs, turned to the supreme court of the Falkland Islands, in 
whose district the research ship "Akademik Sergey Vavilov" was 
operating in those days, to demand the money from the ship 
owner, the Institute of Oceanography. In those same latitudes, 
another ship of the institute, the "Akademik Ioffe," made a 
cruise with paid passengers on board under contract with a 
Canadian tourism company. The captain of the "Vavilov" was 
warned of the threat of seizure, and, landing his passengers in 
one of the ports of Argentina, did not go to the Falklands. The 
completely unsuspecting crew of the "Akademik Ioffe" stopped 
there in Port Stanley. It is now well known how that ended for 
them. The ship was seized. It is still unclear what will happen 
next. In Russia, they prefer not to talk about the incident, and 
in Germany, judging by published articles, they are formulating 
prospects that are by no means pleasant for us. In the article 
"Double Freight," for example, one German newspaper writes: "The 
scientific research ships "Akademik Sergey Vavilov" and 
"Akademik Ioffe" were built in Finland in 1988 and their cost 
exceeded $30 million. Today it cannot be ruled out," the 
newspaper stresses, "that the indebtedness of the German company 
will lead to the sale of the ship "Akademik Ioffe" at auction." 
  I tried to find out from Igor Mikhaltsev, doctor of physical 
and mathematical sciences and the head of one of the 
laboratories of the Institute of Oceanography, what they think 
about this in Russia. By directive of the president of the 
Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation, Igor Yevgenyevich 
was appointed chairman of a special commission to investigate 
this entire story. But through intermediaries I. Mikhaltsev 
refused to meet with the correspondent prior to the conclusion 
of the trial and the final end of this whole story. 
  As of today, the captain of the "Akademik Ioffe" has sent an 
official protest to the governor of the Falkland Islands. A 
letter about defense was sent through an English legal firm that 
undertook to represent the interests of the Oceanographic 
Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the ship. At the 
same time, the institute appealed to a maritime arbitration 
commission in Moscow with an action against the company "Polar 
Shipping" to prevent the sale of the ship at auction. To "free" 
the ship, it is necessary to make a deposit to the Supreme Court 
of the Falkland Islands or to provide a guarantee from a 
first-class Western bank and then to proceed with the trial in 
accordance with the procedures of the English court. The amount 
of the deposit is considerable--about DM400,000 for the claim of 
the shipyard, $50,000 for legal services, and $25,000 to pay for 
the forced stay in the port. Depending upon the course of the 
review of the case in the Supreme Court of the Falkland Islands, 
there may be additional claims of other German firms for a total 
of DM1,125,985.29. It will then be necessary to make a deposit 
for these claims as well. 
  Of course the ship owners have no idea where they can seek 
such funds. But something else is clear. Russian science, which 
has made a truly titanic contribution to the investigation of 
the world oceans, must not lose its authority and the authority 
of a power by degrading itself to the point of transporting 
tourists on unique ships. For this reason, the return of the 
seized ship is a matter of the honor of Russia and it is in its 
interests not to diminish the dignity of domestic scientists 
through the temptation of irresponsible business even on behalf 
of the noble goals of scientific research.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Kozhokin, director of the Russian </F>
Strategic Studies Institute, by Vladimir Khrustov under the 
"Decision-making Mechanism" rubric; date, place not given: 
"Information for Reflection Being Prepared for Top State Leaders 
Adopting Political Decisions by Experts at the Russian Strategic 
Studies Institute" -- first three paragraphs are introduction; 
last three paragraphs are ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI note] 
  [Text] It is believed that information is the most 
expensive commodity in the modern world. Indeed, without having 
accurate, objective, unbiased, and obviously timely information 
at your disposal, it is hard to make a correct decision. 
  The demands for information rise considerably and its role 
increases many times over if it is intended for top state 
leaders adopting political decisions. In this case, however, it 
is not just "pure information" that is needed, but also 
information that is analyzed beforehand by specialists and is 
presented in the form of analytical reports with brief 
conclusions and even recommendations. 
  The Russian Strategic Studies Institute [RSSI], formed by an 
edict of the Russian Federation president, is one of information 
and analysis centers working for the country's top organs of 
power and administration. "What is the priority in your 
activity, and who receives your materials?" -- a conversation 
between your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent and RSSI Director 
Yevgeniy Kozhokin, began with this question. 
  [Kozhokin] The institute's specialization is the problem of 
Russia's national security in all its multifaceted aspects. 
Hence the main range of consumers of our output: The 
President's staff, the government apparatus, the relevant 
Federation Council and State Duma committees, the Security 
Council, the CIS Joint Armed Forces staff, and a number of 
ministries and departments -- defense, internal affairs, the 
security service, the Russian Federation State Committee for the 
Defense Sectors of Industry, and others. 
  [Khrustov] What are the main avenues of the RSSI's 
scientific research? 
  [Kozhokin] Targeted comprehensive programs form their basis. 
I will briefly outline the basic ones. 
  The first one is Russia's national security. A number of 
studies have been carried out within the framework of this 
program to determine approaches toward a concept of national 
security and the structuring of this problem. Methods of 
recognizing and predicting threats to Russia's security are 
being elaborated, and proposals for elaborating the strategy of 
the country's national security are being prepared, taking into 
consideration its new role and position in Europe and the 
Asia-Pacific Region, and indeed the whole world. 
  The second one concerns the so-called nearby foreign 
countries. The main point here is revealing factors of strategic 
risk on Russia's borders, which have emerged following the 
collapse of the USSR and the formation of the new independent 
states: interethnic conflicts, territorial claims and disputes, 
the creation of national armies and the quest for an autonomous 
military policy, and the aspiration of individual states to 
economic autarky. 
  The third is European security. This avenue of the 
institute's activity specifically embraces problems that are 
strategically important to Russia, such as prospects of European 
political and economic integration, new developments in NATO 
policy, in particular the "Partnership for Peace" program, the 
West European Union, and the CSCE. 
  The fourth program is connected with ensuring Russia's 
economic priorities. The institute is comprehensively 
identifying the most important factors in the economic sphere. 
Conceptual proposals for protecting Russia's vital interests in 
the sphere of currency and credit, energy, and food security are 
being elaborated. The latest trends in the development of the 
world economy, which are influencing economic reform in the 
Russian Federation, are being studied. Problems and prospects of 
our country's participation in authoritative international 
economic organizations are being examined. 
  Another important avenue of activity is military policy and 
conversion. The purpose of this study program is to analyze and 
elaborate proposals for Russia's top organs of state power in 
the sphere of military doctrine and organizational development, 
the conversion of the defense industry, the commercialization of 
space, the arms trade, and military-technical cooperation with 
foreign countries, taking world experience and the latest trends 
in international markets into account. 
  We consider participation in the elaboration and 
implementation of comprehensive conversion programs to be an 
independent sphere in the activity of the RSSI. This involves 
the coordination of efforts in formulate legislative initiatives 
in the sphere of conversion; information and analysis backup for 
conversion projects on the basis of developing data banks on the 
state of markets for conversion output and on domestic and 
foreign enterprises which are potential partners in the 
implementation of conversion programs; and the conducting of 
independent experts' appraisals and competitions for conversion 
projects. 
  And finally, the last program, the sixth, concerns the 
environment. A study of the environmental policy of foreign 
countries is being conducted within the framework of this 
program, the development of state-of-the-art environmentally 
clean technologies is being examined, and proposals are being 
elaborated to amend Russian legislation in the sphere of the 
protection of the environment, in particular in connection with 
military activity, and so on. 
  [Khrustov] What is the institute's output proper, and in 
what form do the consumers receive it? 
  [Kozhokin] It is primarily information and analysis material 
in the form of reviews, information, and memorandum. In order 
to work out appraisals that are as objective and balanced as 
possible, the RSSI makes fairly active use of seminars, 
exchanges of opinion, and situation analyses, which are 
regularly conducted with the participation of experts in the 
interests of a number of Russian Federation ministries and 
departments, the Security Council, and also parliamentary 
committees. 
  For example, the institute has already produced around 20 
situation analyses on the problems of Russia's relations with 
the new independent states in nearby foreign parts, the economic 
situation in the country, treaties on the reduction of strategic 
offensive weapons, the role of the United Nations in the modern 
world, the conversion of defense production, and other questions. 
  Of the major subjects which are "in progress," I would 
single 
out the conflict in Yugoslavia. The analytical material we are 
currently preparing for the Russian Federation president and the 
Security Council will also contain a forecast on the postwar 
development of the countries which were once part of Yugoslavia, 
and the Balkan region as a whole. 
  [Khrustov] It follows from what you have said that the task 
of the RSSI specialists is to analyze information, summarize it, 
and make forecasts. From what sources do you obtain this 
information? 
  [Kozhokin] From all kinds of sources: Russian and foreign 
scientific research centers, and the press. We also have 
official information -- from ministries and departments. 
  [Khrustov] Do you rely on your colleagues from other 
institutes? 
  [Kozhokin] Of course, and we involve them very extensively 
in our work. This includes scientists from the Russian Academy 
of Sciences, for example, the United States of America and 
Canada Institute, the Europe Institute, and economic institutes, 
as well as associates of departmental scientific research 
organizations and experts from various sociopolitical movements 
and organizations. 
  [Khrustov] What about colleagues abroad? 
  [Kozhokin] Yes, of course, them too. We understand the need 
for the broadest cooperation with foreign scientific centers and 
individual specialists for the purposes of an objective and 
comprehensive analysis of the problems being studied at expert 
level. 
  The RSSI is developing constructive relations with a whole 
range of state structures, political organizations, and 
scientific research centers of foreign countries. These include 
the North Atlantic Assembly, the NATO International Secretariat, 
the Atlantic Council, the Heritage Foundation (United States), 
the National Defense University (United States), the 
International Institute for Strategic Research (Britain), the 
International Peace Institute (Austria), and others. I can say 
that we have added to this list the Chinese Institute of 
Contemporary International Relations and the PRC Academy of 
Social Sciences Institute of East European and Central Asian 
Countries, whose specialists were the RSSI's guests recently. 
[Kozhokin ends] 
  From Our Files: Yevgeniy Mikhaylovich Kozhokin is 40 years 
old. He is a graduate of the Moscow State University History 
Faculty and a candidate of historical sciences. He has worked 
in Russian Academy of Sciences institutes and has studied West 
European history (specialization -- France). 
  He was a Russian Federation Supreme Soviet deputy in 
1990-1993. He worked in the Committee for International Affairs 
and Foreign Economic Relations, and then he headed the 
Subcommittee for International Security and Intelligence (in the 
Defense and Security Committee). His latest post was deputy 
chairman of the Russian Federation Committee for Affairs of the 
Federation and Nationalities. 
  Since April 1994 he has been director of the RSSI.

<F P=106> [Article by Lt. Col. Mykola Hnidenko, chief of the </F>
Department of Science and Informatization of the Main 
Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense of 
Ukraine, candidate of technical sciences, docent, under the 
rubric "Building the Armed Forces of Ukraine: Experience, 
Problems, Prospects": "Military Science Should Already Be at 
Work" -- first paragraph is NARONA ARMIYA introduction] 
  [Text] On 23 March, NARODNA ARMIYA published an 
interview with Colonel Oleksandr Safronov, head of the 
scientific center of the Kiev Air Force Institute, who holds a 
doctorate in technical sciences and the title of professor. The 
interview dealt with the difficult problems involved in 
organizing the work of the scientific center's scientists, as 
well as in developing military science in general to enable it 
to provide for the needs of the Armed Forces and the 
military-industrial complex of Ukraine. In an afterword 
following the interview, we invited all those interested in 
these issues to join in the discussion. As part of this 
discussion, the editors have received an article from the Main 
Directorate of Military Education of the Ministry of Defense, 
which contains answers to some of the questions that were posed 
in the March interview. We offer this material to all interested 
specialists. 
  Military science in Ukraine is currently in a difficult 
situation. The result of historical circumstances has been such 
that now that Ukraine has become independent, 95 percent of her 
military-scientific potential is comprised of scientists at 
military educational institutions (vnz). Meanwhile, the system 
of organizing military-scientific research, which we inherited 
from the former Soviet Union, was focused mostly at military 
scientific-research institutions, almost all of which are 
located in Russia. Unfortunately, the military educational 
institutions played a secondary role in this system. 
  As a consequence of this kind of scientific-technical policy 
in the Armed Forces of the USSR, the normative documents that 
regulated the organization of scientific work did not provide 
for scientific research to be done by military educational 
institutions under direct contract from the Ministry of Defense, 
the branches [vydy] of the Armed Forces, and the component 
services [rody viysk]. Essentially, the educational institutions 
were barred from participating directly in developing new types 
of weapons, military equipment, etc. These were the prerogative 
of scientific-research institutes, test ranges [polihony], and 
the military-industrial complex. 
  The military educational institutions, including those that 
remained in Ukraine, lacked scientific subdivisions that could 
perform, if only partially, the functions of military 
scientific-research institutes. With some exceptions, the 
scientific potential of the military educational institutions 
was underutilized by the Ministry of Defense. As a result, the 
professors and instructors and the auditors and students 
[slukhachi ta kursanty], having had no opportunity to be 
directly involved in scientific research, proved (as our 
"Soviet" experience demonstrates) unprepared to master new types 
of weapons quickly and at minimum cost. Unfortunately, they lack 
the tools for achieving new scientific results independently 
[vony ne volodiyut instrumentom samostiynoho zdobutku novykh 
naukovykh rezultativ], which makes their training [pidhotovka 
--preparation ?] economically unprofitable and thereby unable to 
meet today's needs. 
  This was one of the main reason why the level of training of 
a large portion of the graduates of the USSR's military schools 
failed to meet the standards with respect to the professional 
qualifications that their diplomas should have guaranteed. Small 
wonder that as a result of this circumstance military 
educational institutions were often accused of being too remote 
from military issues and that the dissertations and diploma 
projects of their graduates had little practical orientation and 
their practical application was slow. 
  Of course, this situation did not hold true for all military 
educational institutions. There were and still are among them 
academies and schools, at which the level of scientific work is 
high. These include, for example, the Military Engineering 
Radiotechnical Academy of the Air Defense Forces [PPO], the 
Kharkiv Higher Military Command Engineering School of Missile 
Troops, the Kiev Higher Engineering Radiotechnical School of the 
Air Defense Forces [PPO], the communications school, the 
aviation school, the Sevastopol Naval Engineering School. It was 
not by chance that these military educational institutions were 
chosen to serve as the foundation for establishing Ukraine's 
system of military education. But we should underscore once 
again that these institutions were exceptions to the rule. Even 
these "elite" military educational institutions had the 
shortcoming described above. The scientific-research 
subdivisions at these institutions were focused on narrow, 
primarily exploratory and theoretical research. 
  We should also draw attention to the legal status of 
military 
scientists. The normative-legal basis governing scientific work 
inherited by the Armed Forces of Ukraine prohibits military 
personnel from performing scientific research and teaching for 
additional pay by holding more than one job [vklyuchayuchy 
sumisnytstvo posad]. It thus limits the rights of military 
scientists which are guaranteed by Ukraine's laws and deprives 
them of equal status with civilian specialists. These conditions 
have forced many military scientists, especially in our 
difficult times, to look for ways to apply their skills and 
talents outside the Armed Forces of Ukraine -- in other 
ministries, departments, and in commercial structures... 
  In other words, it is necessary to work out fundamentally 
new 
documents to regulate scientific work in the Armed Forces of 
Ukraine. This need is dictated not only by the special features 
of the structure of the scientific-research institutions that 
remained in Ukraine after the division of the Armed Forces of 
the USSR, but also by the need to bring these features into 
conformity with the laws of Ukraine. 
  It is worth noting that the situation that exists in the 
field of scientific-technical work in other ministries and 
departments, as well as in Ukraine as a whole, is not much 
better. One of the main reasons for this is inadequate funding 
of science. So far, the Law of Ukraine "On the Fundamental 
Principles of State Policy in the Sphere of Science and 
cientific-Technical Activity..." has also not produced results. 
  There are thus two key tasks that need to be performed in 
the 
realm of building military science in Ukraine. The first is to 
create a scientifically well-founded, rational system of 
scientific-research institutions and organizations within the 
Ministry of Defense, which would include the scientific centers 
of military educational institutions, so that the needs of the 
Armed Forces and the military-industrial complex of Ukraine can 
be provided for in the shortest possible time. The second is to 
prepare a new normative-legal foundation for scientific work in 
the Armed Forces of Ukraine. 
  It should be recalled that as early as at the end of 1991, 
the concept for creating a system of military education of 
Ukraine stipulated the need for creating scientific centers 
within military educational institutions to assume some of the 
functions of the scientific-research institutes of the different 
branches of service. Thus their primary purpose would be to work 
together with the scientific-research institutions of the 
Ministry of Defense and other ministries and departments, as 
well as the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, to solve 
military-theoretical and military-technical problems as required 
by the branches of the Armed Forces and the component services. 
  A second and no less important task of the scientific 
centers, which is dictated by the state national program for 
"Education" ("Ukraine in the 21st Century"), is to promote the 
integration of science and education in military educational 
institutions. 
  The Main Directorate of Military Education is also 
developing 
a normative-legal base for scientific research. Thus, in order 
to provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with a mechanism for 
realizing state guarantees for military personnel carrying out 
contracted work to produce scientific-technical output 
[naukovo-tekhnichna produktsiya], retaining and making wide use 
of the military's scientific potential in scientific research to 
serve the needs of the Ministry of Defense, and providing 
material incentives for those engaged in this research, the 
Department of Science and Informatization of the Main 
Directorate of Military Education has worked out a new Statute 
on the Procedure for Creating (Transferring) 
Scientific-Technical Output According to Contracts in the Armed 
Forces of Ukraine. This statute has been put into effect by an 
order of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. 
  What does this document provide for that is fundamentally 
new? 
  First of all, the statute provides for both a directive and 
a 
contractual approach to the organization of scientific-technical 
work [NDR] in the Armed Forces of Ukraine and grants the right 
to military educational institutions, scientific centers, and 
other institutions and organizations of the Armed Forces that 
have the capacity for carrying out scientific-technical work to 
be the principal contractors to perform scientific-technical 
work for the Ministry of Defense. 
  Second, the commanders of military units and heads of 
institutions and organizations of the Ministry of Defense are 
granted the right to: 
  create temporary creative collectives with the participation 
of military personnel to perform contracted work to create 
(transmit) scientific-technical output; 
  permit military personnel to engage in scientific and 
creative activity to create scientific-technical output in 
military units and institutions and organizations of the 
Ministry of Defense, as well as in the institutions and 
organizations of Ukraine's other ministries and departments on 
terms that involve the combining of staffs [na umovakh shtatnoho 
sumisnytstva]; 
  pay military personnel and other personnel 
[viyskovosluzhbovtsi i sluzhbovtsi] who take part in creating 
scientific-technical output on their own time [u pozasluzhbovyy 
chas]; 
  establish bonuses for military personnel and other 
personnel, 
taking into account their individual creative contribution, for 
top-quality performance in creating scientific-technical output 
delivered to the client; there are to be no set limits in the 
amounts of individual bonuses; 
  pay military personnel and other personnel in accordance 
with 
effective legislation in Ukraine for providing expert opinions 
and consultation in military-scientific and military-technical 
research and development and on projects in the process of 
creating scientific-technical output. 
  At the same time, the statute provides an appropriate 
mechanism for supervising the activity of officials who are 
members of temporary creative collectives and engage in 
scientific work at more than one job [za sumisnytstvom]. 
  Thus, military personnel in the Armed Forces of Ukraine are 
being provided with wide-ranging opportunities to realize their 
scientific and creative potential. It should be noted that the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine were the first among the armed forces of 
the former Union to take decisive steps in this direction. 
  We would like to note that this important document was 
worked 
out with the direct assistance of officers from the Department 
of Science and Informatization of the Main Directorate of 
Military Education Lt. Col. O. Babenko, Capt. third grade I. 
Dolhov, and Docent V. Tkachenko, chief specialist of the 
department and candidate of technical sciences, as well as 
specialists from military educational institutions, scientific 
centers, and the Armaments Staff [shtab ozbroyennya] of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine. The latter include Lt. Gen. I. 
Olenovych, Maj. Gen. O. Kovtunenko, colonels O. Matov, A. 
Dorovskyy, O. Safronov, M. Lukhanin, V. Kasatkin, V. Sereda, and 
others. 
  But the sphere of activity involved in creating a system of 
scientific-research institutions in the Armed Forces of Ukraine 
is much broader and its problems go well beyond those raised in 
this article. Therefore, all specialists and scientists, all 
those who are involved in this work, must make a great effort 
and exhibit enough will, wisdom, and patience to realize the 
goal that has been set to develop military science in Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Article by Col. Valeriy Kovalev under "National Armies: </F>
View of an Observer" rubric: "Who Is Marching Under the 
White-Red-White Banner?"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, in 
March 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Belarus passed a resolution on 
the preservation of the Republic Armed Forces. And as early as 
May, they organized a Ministry of Defense of the Republic of 
Belarus, which began to implement this resolution. 
  In contrast to some other republics of the former 
Union, Belarus did not have to begin to build a national army 
from scratch. It inherited from the Armed Forces of the USSR a 
powerful force grouping numbering about 170,000 men and equipped 
with the most up-to-date combat equipment and 
armament--Belarussian Military District, an air army, a separate 
air defense army, an airborne division, large rear bases, 
arsenals, and depots. It was on this solid foundation that the 
Belarussian Armed Forces were established. 
  One must give credit to the higher leadership of the 
Republic 
and to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Belarus: they 
did not force the process artificially. Everything possible was 
done to see to it that the transformation of the Republic's 
Armed Forces took place smoothly and without severe disruptions 
of the fate of individuals. People with shoulder straps were 
given the opportunity to think and to get their bearings. This 
made it possible to avoid a mass outflow of military personnel 
from the Republic. By the end of 1992, they had concluded the 
legal formation of the Armed Forces and the military doctrine of 
Belarus was affirmed. On 31 December of that year, officers and 
warrant officers swore allegiance to the Republic. And only 
after this did the second and principal stage in the 
establishment of the Armed Forces begin--the reduction of the 
numerical strength of the forces and the transition to a new 
organizational and personnel structure. 
  According to the plan, it will continue until 1 January 
1995. 
In the opinion of Col.-Gen. Pavel Kozlovskiy, minister of 
defense of the Republic of Belarus, however, the basic tasks in 
the reduction and reform of the Armed Forces have practically 
been completed already and as time goes on their appearance will 
not change substantially. 
  What does the Belarussian Army look like after two years of 
"swimming by itself." A higher leadership and command agencies 
have been established and are functioning: the Ministry of 
Defense and the main staff. The next step is that of the Army 
corps that are replacing tank and combined-arms armies. There 
are three of them. The 28th Army Corps includes three separate 
mechanized brigades, a base for the storage of armament and 
equipment (BKhVT), and a set of corps units. They include units 
of missile forces and artillery, signal troops, and engineer 
troops. The Seventh Army Corps is made up of mechanized 
brigades, three BKhVT, and units subordinate to the corps. The 
Fifth Army Corps has two BKhVT and a set of corps units. If 
necessary, the bases for the storage of arms and equipment can 
form mechanized brigades. 
  Thus, the mechanized brigade is the basic combat unit of the 
Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus that is independently 
capable of performing the tasks of mobile defense. It has four 
or five battalions: one or two tank and two or three mechanized 
battalions. It numbers from 3,000 to 5,000 men. According to 
specialists, the brigade in this form is not so far behind the 
previous division in firepower but is more mobile than the 
latter and is better commanded. 
  The air forces have likewise undergone some changes. Instead 
of the former aviation regiments and divisions, nine air bases 
of different purposes have been established. Several 
antiaircraft missile brigades and regiments and individual air 
defense groups form the basis of the republic's air defense 
forces. The separate 120th Guard Rogachevskaya Motorized Rifle 
Division and the 103rd Airborne Division that are part of the 
ground forces represent a real power. 
  In the process of reform, the Armed Forces were subjected to 
significant cuts. In 1992-1993, almost 13,000 officers and 
warrant officers were discharged from them. There are a little 
over 100,000 men "under arms" at the present time. The strength 
of the armed forces will be reduced to approximately 80-85,000 
by the beginning of 1995. In short, the emphasis has been put on 
the establishment of a relatively small army that performs 
purely defensive functions. The Ministry of Defense considers 
that numerical losses must be compensated through up-to-date 
armament and equipment, high proficiency of personnel, and 
qualified command cadres. 
  It is another matter whether the Republic will be able to 
maintain this potential at the same level in the future. This is 
by no means a rhetorical question. Belarus, just as the other 
states of the CIS, is experiencing an extremely serious economic 
crisis. This year the military department has been allocated a 
sum that amounts to only four percent of the Republic budget. It 
is asserted in the finance-economic directorate of the Ministry 
of Defense that this money is sufficient for only the most 
urgent needs. 
  In the words of Aleksandr Tushinskiy, first deputy minister 
of defense of the Republic of Belarus, many other problems 
affecting the combat readiness of the Republic's Armed Forces 
are arising because of the limited financial possibilities. As 
everyone knows, one of its most important components is the 
proficiency of personnel. There is combat training in the forces 
but it is becoming more and more difficult to organize it. In 
the units of the Air Force, for example, they are talking with 
concern about the logged flight hours of pilots approaching a 
critical level of only 20-30 hours. In the ground troops, the 
shortage of vehicle resources is forcing the lion's share of 
exercises to be carried out without taking equipment and people 
to the training centers. Simulators help out to some extent but 
there are not enough of them. 
  The meager budget of the military department gives rise to 
still another serious problem. It is a matter of the social 
protection of service personnel. The government and Ministry of 
Defense of the Republic are making considerable effort to 
provide tolerable conditions for them in their service and daily 
life. In two years it was possible to cut almost in half the 
number of officers without apartments. Last year the housing 
stock of the Ministry of Defense was increased by almost 3,000 
apartments. By 1 January 1995 it is planned to reduce the number 
of those waiting for housing by another 3,000. But even after 
this there will still be more than 7,000 families waiting.... 
  Dissatisfaction with their current material situation is 
forcing many military personnel under various pretexts to leave 
the service for the reserves or to go over to the armies of 
other countries of the CIS. According to the personnel 
directorate of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of 
Belarus, the shortage of platoon leaders alone is now 700 men 
and this number continues to grow. The Armed Forces of the 
Republic now have more than 1,500 vacancies for officer 
positions, mostly pilots and communications personnel. The once 
abundant flow of applications from officers desiring to return 
to their homeland has practically dried up--the conditions of 
service do not suit them. The personnel problem is being made 
worse by the fact that the two military schools in the Republic 
cannot provide for the training of officer cadres in all 
specialties. Cadets have to be sent to Russia for schooling. And 
this is not inexpensive these days. 
  This year it is proposed to begin the transition to contract 
service but these plans had to be postponed for an indefinite 
time. The reason is the same as before. 
  One could continue for some time the list of difficulties 
that the Belarussian Army encountered in the phase of its 
formation. Alas, there is one root to most of them--the acute 
shortage of financing. Apparently, in making the decision to 
establish their own armed forces, the higher levels of authority 
in the republic were not entirely clear about what their support 
will cost. 
  The past two years have made it quite obvious that much more 
funding than was thought will be required to maintain even a 
relatively small but up-to-date and well-armed army that is 
really capable of defending the sovereignty of the state. The 
matter is clear: either the Armed Forces will obtain at least 
the minimum that is needed and they will survive or they must be 
given up entirely. There is no third choice. 
  It appears that they have recognized this in the Government 
of Belarus. In speaking to generals and officers recently on the 
results of a command and staff exercise, Prime Minister of the 
Republic of Belarus Vyacheslav Kebich declared that the Council 
of Ministers of the Republic is greatly concerned about the 
situation developing in the Armed Forces. He also assured them 
that the government of the Republic will persistently pursue the 
course of close cooperation in the area of defense with other 
countries of the CIS and above all with Russia, which will make 
it possible to develop the military with fewer expenditures and 
greater efficiency.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yu. A. Kuznetsov, designer of ground radar </F>
detection stations, by Nikolay Poroskov: "Our Armament Is 
Competitive and It Is Advantageous To Sell It Abroad"] 
  [Text] Yuriy Aleksandrovich Kuznetsov was born in 
1935 in Krasnoyarsk Kray. He finished the radio engineering 
department of Tomsk Polytechnical Institute. He was head of a 
laboratory and section, director of a research institute, and 
general director of a scientific-production association. Since 
1987 he has been general designer of ground radar detection 
stations. He is the chief designer of radar detection stations 
that are part of the antiaircraft missile systems C-300 of 
various modifications. 
  He is a candidate of technical sciences and a winner of 
the Lenin Prize. He has been awarded orders and medals. 
  [Poroskov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, for the first time in many 
years domestic radar equipment, including for military purposes, 
was openly presented to the world at the international 
exhibitions "IDEX-93" in Abu Dhabi, "LIMA-93" in Malaysia, and 
FIDAE-94 in Chile. Our developers and producers were able to see 
the level of development of radar in the world. Who presented 
products? 
  [Kuznetsov] According to our information, most of the 
countries and firms participated that are involved in the 
development of ground detection stations: General Electric and 
Westinghouse (United States), Alenia (Italy), Marconi (Great 
Britain), Siemens (Germany), and firms from South Africa and 
China. Unfortunately, the Japanese and French did not 
demonstrate their radar. 
  [Poroskov] What is the level of development of radar 
stations 
in the world today? What are the trends in the use of wavebands, 
antenna systems, and computer technology? 
  [Kuznetsov] The bands are still the traditional ones, the 
centimeter and decimeter bands. As a rule, radar for the 
detection of low-flying targets determines the range and 
azimuth, but not the altitude, that is, there are two 
coordinates. Stations for medium and high altitudes operate with 
three coordinates. The processing of the signals, as a rule, is 
digital and the detection of the targets and measurement of the 
coordinates is automated. Also automated are measures against 
interference. The stations have control and simulators that can 
imitate the air situation. All of this is with the use of 
computer systems. There is a clear striving to improve the 
mobility of the systems. Basically the areas of development here 
and abroad coincide. 
  [Poloskov] It must be assumed that you received exhaustive 
information at the exhibitions. Does this mean that the West is 
truly open to us and is keeping no secrets? 
  [Kuznetsov] It is by no means so. Yes, we did receive 
brochures or information sheets on almost all the foreign radar 
systems. But it is difficult to obtain information that goes 
beyond this. In Abu Dhabi, for example, representatives of the 
Marconi firm avoided answers and did not give out any brochures. 
At "LIME-93," they were in part "corrected." 
  Of course we frequently were interested in technical and 
design-technological solutions and the firms are not interested 
in reporting on this. But we also did not always receive answers 
to questions on purely user characteristics. An exception was 
the Republic of South Africa--we received answers to all 
questions if they did not involve know-how. 
  [Poroskov] What did our country demonstrate at the 
exhibitions and how did our equipment look next to foreign 
models? 
  [Kuznetsov] Practically all of our stations were unique. The 
radar stations "Nebo" and "Nebo-SV" of the meter band attracted 
the attention of visitors in that they are capable of detecting 
targets built using "Stealth" technology (the so-called 
"invisibles"), are not very susceptible to weather phenomena, 
and have a better capability of detecting highly accurate 
weapons. At the same time, the stations themselves are protected 
against missiles that home in on radio emissions. They simply do 
not exist in the meter band and it is problematical to build 
them. 
  The stations "Kasta-2E1" and "Kasta-2E2" for the detection 
of 
low-flying targets are fundamentally different from foreign 
models in that they have the possibility of raising an antenna 
on a special 50-meter tower, smaller losses in the signal 
channel, qualitative selection of targets, and a greater 
operating range. And "Kasta-2E2" also has the possibility of 
determining the altitude (echelon) of targets. 
  Also looking rather good in comparison with the others were 
the radar stations for autonomous target designation in the 
structure of the antiaircraft missile system "BukM1" and the 
systems S-300P and S-300V. This is primarily because in the 
foreign antiaircraft missile systems of a similar caliber the 
surveillance detection radar is not used, that is, the 
antiaircraft missile system cannot work autonomously but only by 
receiving target designations from the means of the radar field. 
Under our system, they come from radio engineering subunits. 
  Our radar stations set up on one transport unit on a 
caterpillar or automotive chassis are mobile with a high 
cross-country capability and have a large zone of coverage at 
the angle of site. 
  [Poroskov] Everything that you have said is certainly 
pleasing. But the reader may get the impression that we are 
ahead of the entire planet in radar. 
  [Kuznetsov] Because of the better performance of the 
computer 
systems and element base, the radar of other countries has 
better indicators with respect to size of equipment, 
reliability, and input, and in a number of cases they have a 
better design and more comfort. 
  [Poroskov] How can we utilize their experience? 
  [Kuznetsov] We can employ their element base in our 
stations. 
International cooperation in developments and the production of 
computer technology is a normal phenomenon. 
  [Poroskov] Who took an interest in the Russian exhibit and 
to 
what extent? 
  [Kuznetsov] Specialists from manufacturing firms, army and 
police officers, representatives of intermediary and commercial 
firms, and the press--from different regions of the world. Much 
interst was shown, especially in Abu Dhabi. The visitors took 
the entire supply of information sheets, 200 to 250 for each 
radar, and had positive comments. 
  [Poroskov] There is a persistent opinion that Russia is 
selling military equipment at prices significantly below world 
prices. 
  [Kuznetsov] Even in the event that our radar is sold at 
prices 40 to 50 percent below those of analogous foreign 
equipment, we can make good profit because of the relatively low 
wages in Russia. Competitiveness is determined not only by 
quality (although we do have quality) but also by price in terms 
of the effectiveness/cost criteria. Our equipment can be quite 
competitive. It was not so long ago that Japan broke into the 
world market mainly because it had the lowest prices in the 
world. Our situation is now analogous with respect to radar 
equipment. 
  [Poroskov] To trade successfully, it is necessary to have 
the 
appropriate system and experience. Have we gained this in 
distant countries? 
  [Kuznetsov] I think that we need to show our equipment more 
abroad and to advertise it. They are not sufficiently familiar 
with it everywhere. It is also expedient to have an exhibition 
in the territory of Russia that guests of the country could 
visit. A second question is whether it should be a unified 
exhibition or dispersed by branch sections, whether it should 
always be for many branches or have periodically changing 
exhibits. It will be useful to have exhibits that are always 
ready to be sent to any international exhibition. It is 
desirable to accompany every presentation of military equipment 
that is being offered for sale with a demonstration on the test 
range with interested persons invited from other countries. 
  [Poroskov] It is clear from the international practice in 
the 
weapons trade that it is not a matter just of sales. A buyer 
acquiring a radar system ties himself to the manufacturing 
country for a long time. 
  [Kuznetsov] And when we sell equipment, it is necessary for 
us to offer servicing and joint operation. Developing countries 
are especially interested in this, but specialists from states 
with a high standard of living are not eager to go to them. This 
will raise the competitiveness of our products. 
  An offer of joint production of equipment being offered for 
sale may be a decisive factor for a country interested in the 
development of its own defense industry, especially if the level 
of employment of the population is low there. 
  The obligation of our country to improve sold equipment may 
also be attractive for a buyer, naturally for additional payment. 
  [Poroskov] Could all of this be offered by "Oboroneksport" 
(its functions have now gone over to "Rosvooruzheniye") 
representing Russia at exhibitions? And are not the creators of 
the equipment--designers and manufacturers--being left out? 
  [Kuznetsov] They must play a dominant role in the arms 
trade. 
Of course not everyone has sufficient experience in commerce 
today. What is needed is joint work with organizations 
specializing in the arms trade. The latter frequently exaggerate 
their own possibilities and strive to make deals independently 
and without consultation with developers and manufacturers. They 
work under the principle "sold and forgotten." Unqualified 
decisions can do harm. What can be sold, to whom, and how much 
must be decided by the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. The rest should be left to industry. 
  [Poroskov] Attempts were repeatedly made to break away from 
the monopoly of one department (Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations) in foreign trade with weapons.... 
  [Kuznetsov] The state monopoly in this area ought to be 
implemented through the issue of licenses and the establishment 
of quotas. Under this condition, industrial enterprises should 
be allowed to trade directly. And they should be given the right 
to utilize a middleman. That is the procedure in trade 
throughout the world. 
  [Poroskov] Apparently there are traditions and rules in the 
world for the organization of exhibitions. How did we, generally 
novices, look there? 
  [Kuznetsov] The absence of models of some systems, the low 
quality of map cases, brochures, and information sheets and the 
inadequate amount of information did not encourage visitors to 
stay longer at our exhibit. In the main catalog for the 
exhibition in Abu Dhabi, Russia was presented on just one page. 
For other countries, they provided maps of the pavilions and 
notes on each stand with the addresses of the firms. At the end 
of the catalog was a subject index, with the help of which it 
was possible to find the stands for a subject of interest to the 
visitor for all the firms and countries except Russia. 
  Most of the foreign firms began to publish materials on the 
exhibited arms four or five months prior to the exhibition. We 
did extremely little advertising, and we did not prepare in 
advance meetings with representatives of other firms for closer 
cooperation. 
  [Poroskov] Still, Yuriy Aleksandrovich, our products 
appeared 
worthy despite the organizational shortcomings, and you 
apparently did sign some contracts for the delivery of radar 
systems. 
  [Kuznetsov] The first exhibitions could not give quick 
results, and there were no preliminary negotiations. But the 
interest that was shown in our equipment and its competitiveness 
allow us to expect some offers in the near future. 
  [Poroskov] In selling equipment abroad, are you not risking 
leaving your own army without radar stations? 
  [Kuznetsov] Because of the poor financing, the Ministry of 
Defense was forced to reduce purchases of our output 
substantially. In 1992-93, significantly less funding was 
allocated even to research and experimental design work. Trade 
abroad helps to maintain the potential of the industry, and this 
is the basis for the defense capability.

  [Text] [193608] [Tarasov over air show footage] Russia's 
best pilots displayed their skills at the Kubinka airfield near 
Moscow today. This was the third event of its kind. This year 
it was held within the framework of the "Aircraft Engines-94" 
international exhibition. 
  A wide range of Air Force equipment was on show, from the 
old 
Tu-95 long-range aircraft, which has been in the arsenal for 
more than 40 years now, to the super-modern Su-35. During a 
demonstration flight of the latter, test pilot Viktor Pugachev 
performed a new aerobatic maneuver for the numerous spectators. 
For the time being it has been dubbed a "sideways cobra." 
[video shows maneuver] Spectators were enraptured by the 
amazingly harmonious demonstration flights performed by pilots 
of the Kubinka Flight Center. [video shows formation flight] 
  Experts and interested onlookers were able to observe the 
Tu-160 strategic bomber and Ka-50 front support helicopter at 
work. 
  Characteristically, this grand event had been prepared by 
frontline aviation officers with the active support of numerous 
sponsors and aircraft enthusiasts. [193720] [video shows

<F P=106> [Article by Igor Serebryakov: "Russian Military Doctrine: </F>
Why Should Our Army Fight in its Own Country?"] 
  [Text] Life taught us many things over the past few years. 
It taught us not to believe in coincidences, not to trust 
promises of politicians, edicts of the president or actions of 
the government. This is why hasty adoption of Russia's new 
military doctrine evoked a large number of questions in the 
minds of servicemen, and not only them. 
  And, although all political analysis best serves its purpose 
before the fact, even now it still probably not too late to 
analyze the essence and meaning of the document that has become 
the basic formula for the country's defense. 
  Such a document has, of course, been needed for a long time. 
This need arises directly from the state's desire to change its 
internal structure, ideology, and mutual relations. In addition, 
all of Russia's citizens need to finally be given an idea of 
what is happening with the military in our country, and of what 
the authorities intend to do, and not to do, in shaping our new 
military policy. And obviously the process of fundamental 
transformations in all spheres of state activity should be 
reflected in military doctrine. 
  Such a document was drafted, according to plan in some 
respects, and spontaneously in others. Military doctrine matured 
gradually in staff work in the forces, in seminars held by 
military VUZ [higher educational insitution] departments, and in 
the research programs of scientific centers. Thousands of people 
worked on it, and just in 1993 six doctorate and over 20 
candidate dissertations were defended, a number of scientific 
discoveries were made, and hundreds of interesting proposals 
were offered in the course of preparation of the new military 
doctrine. 
  The doctrine's authors had probably been tasked to gather 
together and generalize the results of the labor of military 
specialists. However, the document accounts for none of the 
proposals originating at the local level. 
  The convictions and interests of the people who are to 
implement the doctrine--the military themselves--were left 
unaddressed. Which is why it has come to be widely held in 
Moscow's academies that the new doctrine was adopted so suddenly 
that, by the very fact of its existence, it would keep any other 
concept from making an appearance--for example, one proposing a 
professional army. 
  As we know, any army can man itself by two 
principles--voluntarily or by compulsion. The Russian Army has 
traditionally formed on the basis of the compulsory principle. 
  Following the lead of journalists and scientists, three 
years 
ago many generals began boldly saying that it is impossible for 
a compulsory army to become a professional one. But now, the 
idea of a professional army is brought to mind at the top with 
increasing rarity. Cozy offices in the staff buildings of the 
old, tested army, which preferred to fight not with ability but 
with numbers, have been found for all of the progressive 
generals. 
  The idea of strict selection and high quality training of 
servicemen has been reduced to clumsy half-measures, like 
service by enlisted men on the basis of contracts. Supported 
neither socially nor economically, the contract service program 
has transformed into a joke, discrediting the very idea of a 
professional army in Russia. Contract service has attracted 
chiefly those who are seeking easy money or are at odds with the 
law. Both the special and the general educational training of 
these soldiers is so low that the textbooks commanders usually 
use for training in the troops are over their heads. Pressing 
people into contract service, the military commissariats fulfill 
the plans dictated to them from above "at any cost," even going 
so far as to deceive both the contract soldiers themselves and 
the officers under whose leadership these people will have to 
serve. Something said by one of the commanders of a battalion 
manned by such a "contingent" has now swept through a good half 
of the Army: "So what did that military commissar do, make a 
deal with a prison camp chief?" 
  The so-called combined principle of manning the Armed Forces 
proclaimed in the new military doctrine enables the military 
leadership to enlist the state's human resources without any 
sort of quality control, taking its cue not from conscription 
needs but from a reluctance to complicate its life 
  The generals don't understand that signing contracts with 
willing persons isn't enough--the entire system of selection and 
combat training of soldiers has to be changed fundamentally. 
Such a requirement conflicts with the fundamental, historically 
evolved method by which our troops have waged war. Russian 
generals have never paid attention to losses, generously 
fertilizing the future with the bones of their soldiers. And 
this "science of winning" is perhaps the only thing in which the 
continuity of the generations of Russian generals clearly 
expresses itself. 
  However, there is one other, more important circumstance: 
The 
subconscious notion that the Army serves as a prison for a part 
of our people continues to foil attempts to create professional 
armed forces in our country. The isolation potential of the 
barracks has been expertly utilized in Russia since day one. 
When in past centuries a revolutionary situation evolved in 
Finland or Poland, the emperor defused it by mass conscription 
of youngsters from the restless regions into the army. But we 
went even further: Conscriptions are conducted regularly, from 
all regions. It has gotten to the point where all of our men 
serve in the army, and all are made equal in the ranks. And it 
was only in our country that the word "simple" sounded so much 
like praise, while "complex" ("special") was perceived as 
something negative. The individual was compelled to conceal his 
uniqueness, and was ashamed of his individuality. Keeping his 
opinions to himself, gradually he lost his ability to hold an 
opinion, he forgot how to think, he ceased thinking. The ideal 
warrior! How could you refuse such easy-to-manage soldiers? 
  But let's return to the military doctrine. First of all, 
let's define the location of this document in the coordinates of 
the country's sociopolitical life in 1993. Let's consider the 
chronology: October--the tragedy at the White House; 
November--the presidential edict approving the "Fundamental 
Principles of Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation"; 
December--the national referendum on the new Constitution and 
elections to the Russian parliament. Such a sequence of event 
makes you wonder. The question that arises right away is this: 
What should come first? The fundamental law of the state, or its 
military doctrine? The answer is obvious. First we adopt the 
constitution, and then the military doctrine. If that were what 
happened, we would certainly have heard loud demands to 
reconcile the fundamental principles of the military doctrine to 
the constitution's postulates. It would not be easy to ignore 
such demands at any level of authority. But were the sequence of 
adoption of the documents to be changed, as was done in our 
case, the military doctrine would become a given, claiming 
priority of its principles over constitutional principles. 
  The hands of politicians in military actions have been 
untied 
for all time, the Armed Forces turn out to be independent of the 
constitution, and military affairs are dependably screened from 
public scrutiny. 
  The inconsistency between the actual tenor of Army life and 
constitutional norms is so astounding that it requires separate 
discussion. The new Russian Constitution, no matter what 
criticism it may endure, nonetheless does devote a sizable 
amount of room to the individual, declaring the rights and 
liberties of the individual. But real military life is 
characterized at the moment objective lawlessness and lack of 
freedom. The military doctrine takes no account at all of human 
rights in any of its premises. "Labor is free. Each shall have 
the right do whatever he wishes with his working abilities, and 
to select his nature of activity and occupation.... Compulsory 
labor is forbidden," states Article 37 of the Constitution. But, 
in the meantime, the Army continues to stand on involuntary 
labor, and the military doctrine confirms manning predominantly 
on the basis of the compulsory principle for the foreseeable 
future. 
  Or, "...each shall have the right to freedom and 
inviolability of the person. Arrest...shall be based only on 
court rulings," declares Article 22 of the Constitution. Reading 
this, we would have to assume that our Army' disciplinary 
regulations have now been rescinded. 
  And once again, "...the home is sacred. No one shall have 
the 
right to enter a home against the will of persons residing 
therein." This is from Article 25 of the Russian Constitution. 
But according to the disciplinary regulations, the barracks 
(officers' dormitories) are not homes, and privates and NCOs 
(officers) residing therein are not protected by the 
Constitution. 
  There are many examples of this sort. Also among them is a 
highly significant one. According to Article 27 of the 
Constitution, "...anyone who is lawfully present on territory of 
the Russian Federation shall have the right to travel freely." 
To people knowing what military service is like, any comment 
would be superfluous in this regard. 
  A strange picture develops. With one hand the state gives 
normal rights and liberties to the military as well as the rest 
of the citizens of Russia, but with its other hand it confirms a 
document in which these rights are not foreseen. Which document 
is to be followed by a military chief? And by subordinates? 
Perhaps Article 45 of the Constitution, which states that 
"...each shall have the right to defend his rights and liberties 
by all means not prohibited by law"? Our Army will become a 
strange spectacle when some will be lawfully infringing upon the 
rights of others, while those others will be lawfully defending 
them. 
  After all of this, I have this great urge to call the 
military doctrine a political propaganda document oriented on 
objectives far from those of strengthening the country's defense 
capabilities. But let's wait a little. Let's think on this a 
little more. First let's agree on the basic concepts. 
  Military doctrine is defined as a system of views, adopted 
by 
the state for a given period of time (stipulated in the doctrine 
itself), upon the essence, nature and goals of possible war, and 
upon the program of preparations for it by the state and the 
armed forces. The fundamental principles of military doctrine 
are based on the society's social and political structure, the 
state of its economy, and the geopolitical situation of the 
country and its probable adversaries. The military doctrines of 
all states have been written on the basis of this matrix, which 
is then filled in with the content of the political programs of 
the governments and ruling parties of these states. 
  Military doctrine takes on a meaning of its own only when 
the 
concept central to it comes into being--a probable adversary. 
Then the defense program acquires its special military 
orientation. And, developing with regard for the forces and 
resources of the potential opponent, it establishes what forces 
and resources it needs for war and in preparation for it. 
Military doctrine simply has no meaning when a probable 
adversary is not defined. You can't prepare for war against an 
unknown adversary, without knowing the direction from which the 
blow might come. It is impossible to organize military 
professional training, carry out defensive measures, select 
armament systems, position the forces, determine their combat 
readiness, and assign military reconnaissance tasks. 
  It is impossible to set the upper limit of the material 
needs 
of the state and the Army for preparing and conducting warfare. 
When the probable adversary is left unnamed, claims by the 
general officers and leaders of the military-industrial complex 
upon any given percentage of the national income would be 
justified. But in the new Russian military doctrine the probable 
adversary isn't even defined approximately. The authors of this 
document believe "...wars and military conflicts to be the main 
danger to stability and peace." But almost all officers with 
whom I've discussed the doctrine shake their heads at this in 
bewilderment: Does this mean that war is what creates the danger 
of war? 
  But looking at things objectively, can we really say that 
Russia is threatened by no one? Have absolute tranquility and 
international harmony really settled over the world? Are there 
really no countries, with interests opposite to those of our 
state, making territorial, economic and even political claims 
upon us? And where, I'd like to know, are the nuclear missiles 
of the USA, France and England still aimed? And what about 
China's? Aren't they still aimed at us? Isn't this also true of 
conventional missiles as well? 
  Once upon a time an adversary did attack Russia, catching 
our 
people and Army by surprise because the political ambitions of 
certain individuals precluded the possibility of a professional 
military approach to defense. The one true lesson of history is 
that no one is learning anything from it. 
  The Soviet Union's military doctrine believed the developed 
capitalist countries, and chiefly the United States, to be the 
probable adversary. This provided the possibility for 
purposefully developing the economy and military science, and 
carrying out political training of the troops. The corresponding 
army mentality evolved, and the professional skills of fighting 
a specifically indicated adversary were practiced over many long 
decades. 
  By inertia, many commanders continue to develop these same 
skills in their subordinates, while realizing deep within their 
souls that such independent activity contradicts all of the 
state's policy today. But what are commanders to do? Nothing new 
has been proposed to them. Nothing different is being taught to 
them. Nothing specific is being said. 
  When asked in a recent training exercise in a certain 
Siberian division whom they would most likely go to war with, 
one out of every three privates didn't have an answer, while one 
out of every five, after some hemming and hawing, finally named 
the United States, or Iraq, or Germany, or China, or Georgia, or 
Abkhazia. The most interesting thing is that all of them could 
be right. After all, in addition to the traditional missions, 
the new military doctrine presupposes peacekeeping 
operations--stationing the Armed Forces of the Russian 
Federation outside the country. Such actions are already a 
reality, and there are serious apprehensions that they could 
occur with much greater frequency in the future. And then our 
youngsters will be going to new Afghanistans, new Angolas, new 
Karabakhs. They will go to render international assistance, to 
rescue some government, to correct someone's mistakes. They will 
go to their deaths, "rectifying death by death." 
  Why is a probable adversary not indicated in our doctrine? 
Could it be that the country's leadership knows who he is, but 
is afraid to anger him, while not being afraid to anger its own 
army? Or, having accomplished a unique, radical revolution in 
all military science, could it be that the president of Russia 
and his Ministry of Defense have decided to the keep this 
opponent secret from their own army? Or could it be that having 
no political course to follow, no ideological values, our 
politicians are hoping to be good friends with everyone in the 
international arena? 
  There are many suppositions, but there is still only one 
question: Do the authors of the new military doctrine realize 
that by not indicating a probable adversary in it, and thus 
asking their country and army to prepare for war with any old 
state, we are willingly or unwillingly putting the entire world 
on our list of potential foes? 
  Military doctrine has two sides--sociopolitical and 
military-technical. The former embraces issues pertaining to the 
economic, social, and legal principles of accomplishing the 
goals of a future war. This side is determined by the society's 
main political objectives. But we didn't have such objectives at 
the moment of approval of the doctrine. They were formulated 
later on in the Constitution. Therefore, the military doctrine 
was unable to express the views of the state on the possible 
nature of wars and military conflicts, or define the principles 
and directions of development of the Armed Forces. We will find 
nothing on the list of measures to be carried out up to the 
second millennium that would offer evidence of the seriousness 
of plans to reform the Army and "get combat-capable, modern 
forces as a result." 
  The military-technical side of doctrine is a more 
utilitarian 
concept. It includes questions of the strategy and tactics of 
combat activities, the equipment supplied to the Armed Forces, 
and their professional training. This side of doctrine legalizes 
the complex mutual relations of army structures with the 
military-industrial and scientific complexes, and with the 
central and local administrations, and in a sense documents 
processes that have been taking shape over the course of years 
and decades. The military-technical side of doctrine cannot 
objectively come into being before all of these relations are 
fully evolved and stabilized. Have they already stabilized in 
the Russian Army? Are all ties set up and working in exemplary 
fashion? Can the quality of the personal and financial support 
provided to the Army today be taken as the model? 
  But the section of the doctrine that expounds the concept of 
activity in the military-technical area is especially 
surprising. This section is presented in the new military 
doctrine as if its authors bear not even a suspicion of the 
state economy's devastation, of the extremely deep financial 
crisis, or of the social cataclysms. Had economists gone over 
this document before it was cast in stone by politicians and the 
military? Had they asked their traditional question: "What's the 
bottom line?"? What is the bottom line of operational 
restoration of the extremely expensive military 
infrastructure--the new airfields, the transportation net, the 
components of the air defense and missile systems, the military 
posts? What will be the cost of withdrawing forces back into 
this country and accommodating them, of introducing a new 
manning system, of participating in regional military conflicts, 
of making personnel changes in the Armed Forces, and of 
maintaining retired military personnel, whose numbers are 
continually growing with the Army's reduction? And that's far 
from everything. Every item, every word of the new military 
doctrine means billions upon billions of rubles. 
  Having lost much of our order of battle with the 
disintegration of the USSR, our Army is presently in a woeful 
state. There was a time when it was built upon the principles of 
integration, of supporting all theaters of military operations 
with unified air defense systems and air forces, of conducting 
combat operations with regard for the possibilities of the Navy 
and Strategic Missile Forces. These principles have now been 
violated. Such an army no longer exists. Troops and equipment of 
the strongest first-line districts departed together with 
Ukraine and Belarus, which totally devastated the complex 
structure of the country's entire defense, and laid bare the 
Western Sector. The tragic events in the Caucasus, in the Dnestr 
region, and in Azerbaijan and Tajikistan severed all lines of 
communications almost entirely, thus depriving the dozens of 
units stationed in these regions of the possibility of 
conducting combat activities. These formations are feeling the 
shortage of personnel more and more keenly. In turn, the absence 
of resources and of proper personal conditions makes it 
impossible for the Ministry of Defense to relocate ground forces 
and form some sort of workable system out of them. 
  The Strategic Missile Forces have found themselves in a 
situation in which a significant fraction of their launchers are 
on the other side of Russia's borders. Moreover, all such 
facilities require the constant attention of specialists, whom 
no CIS country but Russia has. Imagine what awaits the launchers 
in the absence of constant maintenance. And how is such 
maintenance to be carried out abroad? How are these facilities 
to be transferred to the other country if they are controlled 
from a single center? How much resources will it take to 
reorient the flight assignments in order to plug the holes 
formed in our country's nuclear missile shield? Still, despite 
everything, and owing exclusively to the heroism of their own 
officers, the Russian missile forces are maintaining their 
combat readiness. 
  The country's air defense system, which has been ravaged by 
numerous reorganizations, is in dire need of radical improvement 
of all of its technical resources, and of more effective 
coordination of its actions with other armed forces. Strategic 
aviation suffers from a shortage of fuel and personnel, and it 
chronically lacks the resources for practical training of 
specialists. Torn apart by conflicts, the navy is desperately 
trying to preserve its unity and fighting capability, and to 
reject the old combat equipment others insist it must accept. 
  The Army has been strangled by housing and personal 
problems. 
Officers haven't been paid for several months. There are not 
enough enlisted men, and "mestnichestvo," "dedovshchina," 
harassment and favoritism flourish in the units. Servicemen 
uprooted from Russian soil have lost all hope of returning to 
their motherland. The are in despair. The one thing they have 
been capable of is armed defense of their children, their wives, 
and their families against bands of nationalists. 
  In these times, having taken upon itself the inordinate 
burden of maintaining order along the borders of the former 
USSR, Russia is currently maintaining more troops abroad 
(including border guards) than any other country in the world. 
  After the Civil War, at the beginning of the period of the 
New Economic Policy, Lenin reduced the Army from 5 million to 
550,000. That is, by almost 10 times. But this took more than 
just a single year. As of the moment of their establishment by 
an edict of the Russian president dated 7 May 1992, the Armed 
Forces numbered around 3 million persons. By 1995 their 
numerical strength is supposed to be not more than 2 million. 
But such a downward progression is not to be observed. On the 
contrary the administrative machinery of the Russian Ministry of 
Defense seems to have already surpassed that which existed in 
the Soviet Army in terms of both number of workers and quantity 
of general-grade positions. 
  The equipment situation is also critical. Of the five and a 
half thousand tanks in the Russian Army, around a thousand are 
practically unusable. During the next year half of the tanks 
will become obsolete from a military standpoint. There is 
nothing with which to replace them. Of 7,000 infantry fighting 
vehicles and 6,500 artillery systems, over a third require 
immediate overhaul. The full thousand of our helicopter gunships 
require immediate repairs and maintenance. This list can go on 
and on. And even so, these are nothing more than the general 
statistics. Behind each one of them stands the tragedy of people 
deprived of the possibility of doing their work. In many of the 
units, all of this is believed to be the result of intrigues by 
our enemies, conspiracies, and betrayal. Here and there, we hear 
appeals for action: "...could it be that our commanders have an 
aversion to rending foreign uniforms with Russian bayonets?" 
Young, hot-blooded lieutenants can't understand why everyone is 
calmly watching as things of value that had taken years to 
create are being destroyed, turned inside out, and sold for a 
pittance in a single moment. 
  How many packs of chewing gum can you get for a 
gyro-stabilized strategic nuclear missile launcher, or for a 
mobile army command post? That's not an idle question. Such 
deals have been made. 
  Yes, Russia has always traded in arms. Just in the 1980s for 
example, the military-industrial complex sold over 6,000 tanks, 
20,000 guns, 17 submarines and thousands of airplanes to foreign 
countries. Through its weapon sales the USSR controlled the 
geopolitical map of the world, shored up and set up regimes, and 
maintained or relieved tension in certain regions. But the 
process was kept under meticulous control, and the weapons were 
carefully accounted for. Each cartridge was accountable. The 
loss of a single pistol was considered to be an incident of the 
gravest import, one to be reported to the Main Command. 
  Following disintegration of the USSR, the Army wrote off 
around a third of all of its military equipment and armament 
within a year. It was scrapped, hidden, and stolen for 
subsequent sale. But in order to sell weapons thoughtlessly, you 
first have to sell your conscience. Who knows how many tens of 
dollars the conscience of a Russian officer costs today? 
  Whether the authors of the doctrine like it or not, the 
individual, along with his own philosophy and interests, remains 
the decisive factor of modern warfare. It is no secret to anyone 
that all of the world's large armies invest enormous resources 
into shaping a sense of patriotism in their soldiers, a system 
of spiritual values and particular political convictions (no 
matter what anyone says about depoliticizing the Army). All of 
this is accomplished through a system of indoctrination, which 
exists in every army of every state. Indoctrination is an 
attribute of an army, a means of controlling the armed forces. I 
know of very few exceptions to this rule, and when it gets down 
to the large armed forces and countries, there is but one 
exception--Russia. The destruction of our old system of military 
indoctrination is almost complete, and it is continuing. Listen 
to what I'm saying--it is not being changed, it is not being 
reworked, but it is being destroyed. The former system was of 
course oversaturated by ideology, it totally excluded 
creativity, and it was built on a purely Talmud-like foundation. 
But at least it was well-conceived, and army indoctrination 
consistently shaped the army's culture, which was rooted in 
Soviet traditions and customs. They were expressed in the form 
of numerous military customs and courtesies, from the 
simplest--saluting--to the most complex--the military oath taken 
in a solemn situation, holiday parades, and so on. Having become 
divested of the ideological principles of communism, the once 
perfect system of troop indoctrination immediately lost meaning, 
and transformed into the tattered clothing of the army. This 
process was helped along considerably by organizational measures 
directed at the former Main Political Directorate: hatchet-job 
reorganizations and personnel changes in the Directorate for 
Educational Work With Personnel, persecution of political 
workers in the forces, and many other clumsy actions by Armed 
Forces reformers. Together with the old system of 
indoctrination, the Army reformers did in all of military 
culture. No one gave any thought to what was to replace it. The 
Russian Army does not have its own internal military culture. It 
is attempting to unconditionally inject new political meaning 
into old army customs and courtesies, and it is trading Soviet 
flags for Russian ones, but all of the customs, all of the 
courtesies are rigidly determined by their traditional communist 
content, and nothing new is being added. And without internal 
army culture, it would be naive to discuss organization and 
combat readiness of the armed forces. No one has yet suggested a 
system for the army under which people would be brought together 
not by a dependence upon an idea, but by the idea itself. And 
without unity, without unity of thought, it is impossible to 
have a modern army. 
  Let me also add that all indoctrination is inseparable from 
the training process. Because officers and generals didn't know 
how to indoctrinate their subordinates, or in what, they have 
lost their possibility for teaching them military affairs per se 
in organized, high quality fashion. 
  How did it happen that the undermined socioeconomic and 
moral 
tenets of the Army went unreflected on the pages of this 
important state document? How is the highly important formula of 
defense going to work? How about the formula of victory? The 
important thing now is, who's victory over whom? 
  What makes the new military doctrine fundamentally different 
is that it gives the president and government the right to use 
the Armed Forces to fight not only a foreign but even an 
internal foe. To put it simply, this military doctrine gives the 
Army permission to shoot at civilians, to use mighty army 
weapons against them. It may be possible that they will now 
begin giving combat decorations for this. 
  The unprecedented level of freedom that the authors of the 
doctrine give to the military-political leadership (or leader) 
in independently choosing the adversary both outside the state 
and within it is simply frightening. 
  The military has been given unlimited possibilities, and it 
has been shown unprecedented trust. But thank God, this is no 
joy to officers. They have no wish to shoot at civilians, no 
matter what their convictions, no matter what their behavior. If 
someone violates the law, we have the militia, the OMON [Special 
Purpose Militia Detachments], and the security service. Why the 
military? The Army is supposed to fight another army, and not 
anyone else. This unique feature of the military doctrine 
explains to some degree all of its preceding contradictions. If 
the Armed Forces are to be used to fight an internal enemy, the 
absence of many concepts from the doctrine familiar to military 
people is fully natural and justified. A ministry that is bent 
on force, and takes aim into its own country, has need of 
neither the sociopolitical nor the military-technical side of 
policy. A ministry of this kind has other objectives, a 
different system of preparation. True, in civilized countries 
the army does not perform internal functions. In Czarist Russia 
for example, such functions were performed by a gendarmerie. And 
it did quite well without military doctrine. 
  But even in instructions followed by the gendarmerie, the 
probable adversary, the potential violator of the peace, was 
clearly defined. He was an anarchist or a social-democrat, a 
socialist-revolutionary or a Bundist. Do those who wrote this 
present doctrine realize that by not indicating any probable 
adversary within the country, they have thus wittingly or 
unwittingly fingered all political parties, all social groups as 
the probable adversaries of the Armed Forces? And doesn't that 
mean all of the Russian people?

<H5>  Forward </H5>
  The great importance of fighter aviation under present-day 
conditions is determined by the essence of Soviet defensive 
doctrine. Fighter aviation must reliably protect the troops and 
installations of the nation's rear from air strikes and support 
the combat actions of other arms of aviation. New-generation 
aircraft are entering the fighter aviation armament with high 
tactical performance and powerful weaponry, and its command 
posts are being equipped with increasingly sophisticated 
automated control systems. It is impossible to fully utilize the 
high combat capabilities of the new equipment without knowledge 
of tactics, however. 
  Tactics teach how to vanquish the enemy in the most 
difficult 
situation, to execute combat actions with the least forces by 
virtue of surprise, strategem, and a creative approach to the 
task. 
  However it often happens that aviation commanders and pilots 
do not bother either with cunning calculation or bold original 
maneuver, and the importance of tactics as the art of waging 
battle is belittled. These defects are an inheritance of those 
times when display and show were in honor, when directives and 
instructions suppressed initiative and combat activeness, and 
the monotonous background of exercises taught the men not so 
much to think as to execute. 
  Perestroyka in Soviet society is changing all aspects of its 
life. Now as never before air commanders and all flight 
personnel are expected to show flexibility of tactical thinking, 
especially in sharp tactical situations, the ability to form and 
to defend one's position, to discard outmoded tactical devices, 
and to look toward the future. For this it is important to 
understand those changes which have occurred and are occurring 
today in tactics, in practice air-to-air battles distinguished 
by more resolute goals, high effectiveness, and diversity of 
tactical techniques. 
  This book reveals the basic problems of tactics of fighter 
aviation and the components of tactical mastery of fighter 
pilots (the author calls them the secrets of irresistible 
attacks). From all the variety of these questions the book cites 
the most important and interesting. They are discussed in 
accessible form and at the same time without excessive 
simplification. The author introduces us to the history of 
tactics, ably drawing on the experience of air battles of the 
Great Patriotic War. 
  The development of the tactics of fighter aviation and its 
problems are discussed as they apply to the combat missions of 
fighters, improvement of aviation equipment, tactics of the 
adversary, and the place of fighters in air defense systems. 
Explaining the law-governed regularities in the evolution of 
combat missions, in the relations of tactics and equipment, in 
the confrontation of tactics of friendly and enemy fighters, in 
their interaction with ground air defense systems in the past, 
present and future is a difficult task, but I believe that the 
author has accomplished it. The theoretical material, combined 
with lively instructive examples never before cited in our 
literature, and the necessary commentaries will help the reader 
to understand the essence of specific phenomena of tactics. 
  Questions of tactical training of aviators are discussed 
with 
the same completeness and soundness. Here the reader will also 
find much that is interesting. Recommendations for planning of 
air-to-air battles and developing tactical techniques, the use 
of stratagems in battle, and rational use of the time factor, 
command and control of the battle, on morale and psychological 
preparation of the flight personnel, and other advice gives this 
part of the book a practical bent. The author does not limit 
himself to demonstrating only the positive in combat training of 
fighter aviation; he also explains the causes of negative 
phenomena in tactics, and the ways of making combat training 
nearer to combat reality, and cautions aviation commanders, 
pilots, officers of command posts, and students in VVUZ 
[military higher educational institutions] (namely, those to 
whom this book is addressed) against possible errors. 
  The author of this book, professor and doctor of military 
sciences, participant in the Great Patriotic War, A.B. Krasnov, 
now working in the field of tactics, has managed to trace the 
paths of its development quite fully, to make broad 
generalizations and interesting conclusions. His book, which is 
in harmony with the times in terms of content and the logic of 
his arguments, promotes creativity in tactics, and leads one to 
think. Without a doubt it will interest not only aviators of our 
generation; veterans and youngsters preparing for service in 
military aviation will also enjoy it. 
  I recommend this book to the readers with pleasure. 
  Col.-Gen. of Aviation A. Borsuk 
<H5>  Introduction </H5>
  The intermittent howl of the engines carries down from the 
skies. The tight flows of air strike the blades of turbines, 
sending the winged craft forward to where the adversary has 
prepared for a frontal attack, his airborne weapons in full 
readiness for battle. Two opposing groups of fighters face a 
heated skirmish. Another moment and the aircraft flash into 
view, cascades of maneuvers merge into an unending chain 
executed at the limits of capabilities of man and machine, now 
and again the smoky trails of launched missiles rip the limpid 
blue. The dogfight begins, a confrontation of human intellects, 
a competition of the courage, endurance, and self-control of the 
participants in each attack. 
  In short attacks are concentrated the experience and 
knowledge of the pilots, displaying the ability to resist the 
enemy with their will and mastery. The strength of the elements 
is even, tactical performance and the conditions of joining 
battle approximately the same. Whose side will prove to have the 
invincible attack? Whose missiles will more quickly find and 
destroy their assigned targets? 
  In the book, the tactics of fighter aviation reveal the 
secrets of irresistible fighter attacks. Its title requires 
explanation. What secrets are we talking about? Those which are 
part of the tactical proficiency of flight personnel. How may we 
foresee the actions of the adversary and model the battle, how 
many tactical techniques must be held in reserve, how best may 
we use the high capabilities of our weapons, how can we outsmart 
the enemy and ably control the battle? All these are the secrets 
of irresistible attacks, or components of tactical proficiency, 
which the pilot cannot do without. 
  In order to grasp these secrets, however, one must first 
turn 
to the factors which determine the development of tactics. The 
dynamism of the changes occurring in tactics will depend on the 
changes in the content of combat missions which are performed by 
fighters. The improvement in aviation equipment leads to the 
development of tactics and the replacement of some tactical 
techniques by others. Obviously the corresponding demands are 
imposed on tactics by an active adversary, forcing abandonment 
of the prevailing stereotypes. Without the adversary there can 
be no tactics, just as there can be none without the ground air 
defense systems which interact closely with the fighters and 
share the success of battle with them. 
  The influence on tactical development of these factors, 
which 
are not identical and at times even contradictory, is traced in 
the first part of the book. They are closely connected to one 
another, and only for convenience of discussion are they 
examined separately. The second part of the book relates 
successively the activity of commanders, pilots, officers of 
command posts in preparation for battle, during battle, and in 
command and control of battle, and addresses the inculcation of 
high morale and aggressiveness. 
  It should be stipulated at the outset that the book is not 
intended for specialists who know all the subtleties of aviation 
equipment. We are far more interested in the tactical aspect of 
the matter than the specific tactical performance of even the 
latest models of equipment and design features. Because of this, 
some things have to be simplified, some things mentioned in 
passing. 
  However the reader will look in vain in the book for 
ready-made prescriptions of irresistible attacks, i.e., tactical 
recommendations. There are too many of them, and situations in 
battle are such that only a specific tactical technique must 
correspond to each of them. But on the other hand, that which is 
good the first time, is worse the second, and the tenth time 
even harmful -- this is a typical lack of originality. Thus 
identical tactical technique, even if optimal, does not help 
when repeated again and again. This is what they have in mind 
when they say that there are no prescriptions in tactics, so it 
is important not to "write prescriptions" but to have the entire 
"pharmacy" available, in order to have the necessary tactical 
technique on hand at any moment. This is tactical proficiency, 
proficiency of the commander, the pilot, the command post 
officers, as necessary to him as air, in order to quickly and 
appropriately select those very "prescriptions" which allegedly 
do not exist in tactics, and to use them steadfastly and 
precisely in battle. 
  Today tactics are developing especially quickly. The marked 
defensive nature of our military doctrine and the obligations 
undertaken by the Soviet Union not to initiate military actions 
objectively may give certain advantages to the attacking side in 
the surprise delivery of air strikes. We cannot but take this 
into account. In such situations, when the initiative belongs to 
the adversary, many traditional ideas regarding the role and 
place of fighters in the repulse of aggression, and the modes of 
combat action they utilize will change. The most urgent need for 
changes in tactics, and the old thinking, the outmoded 
leadership style, born in the time of stagnation, come into 
conflict. How could one reveal here the cause and effect links 
of phenomena and discard prevailing stereotypes, if at the time 
triumphant reports from exercises and sham were considered more 
important than creativity in tactics, if any maxim uttered from 
above, arising now from ambition, now from "intuition," was 
substantiated and scientifically confirmed?! Of course when the 
issue is voluntarism in tactics, the word "intuition" must be 
taken in quotes. And here, strange as it may seem, our readiness 
to immediately react to various sorts of directives, 
authoritative instructions and recommendations, was not averted 
even by the sad lessons of the past, the tragic consequences of 
distortions concerning the role and place of fighter aviation, 
and justification of the "sole correct" provisions of tactics. 
  The world of tactics is complex and contradictory. Gradually 
expanding its borders, it today offers fighters many new and 
unexpected paths, not even guessed at just a few years ago. 
Sometimes answers to them, albeit incomplete, may be found in 
the experience of the past, and in the practice of the best 
pilots, others are soundly answered by military theorists. But 
how many problems there are to which no one has yet found an 
answer! 
  Thus if neither accumulated experience nor simple and 
reasonable discussion suggest how to proceed in order to achieve 
victory in battle, the secrets of irresistible attacks must 
remain unrevealed for some time. But is this surprising? It has 
happened in the history of tactics more than once. We shall 
peruse the pages of the long-ago and recent past, examining 
those events which became turning points in the development of 
tactics, accelerating or slowing it, and then we shall examine 
the present, and try to look at the future of tactics. 
  The goal of the book is to prompt the reader to reflect, and 
to offer food for thought. So the reader will not always find 
unequivocal assessments in the book, and some problems of 
tactics are analyzed in it from different, sometimes paradoxical 
viewpoints. Study and pondering of these problems will allow one 
to see and better understand the novelty of the current tactics, 
to overcome any established dogmas, and to conduct a quest for 
the new in tactics. In other words, we are all the creators of 
tactics. 
<H5>  PART I. FIGHTERS IN BATTLE </H5>
<H5>  Chapter I. What Missions Should Fighters Perform? </H5>
  The fighter was developed for battle. Its basic purpose is 
to 
destroy the adversary in the air. Air-to-air combat began 
immediately with the appearance of aircraft over battlefields of 
the First World War, which conducted reconnaissance and 
delivered strikes and ground troops. Initially the lighter and 
faster aircraft were used as fighters, and then special planes 
were developed with airborne machineguns. Thus did fighter 
aviation [FA] begin its existence. 
  In a short time fighter aviation was faced with many combat 
missions. It protected the troops and important rear 
installations from attack of enemy aircraft, safeguarded the 
security and freedom of action of friendly bombers and scout 
planes. The basic missions of Soviet fighter aviation, which 
grew up from separate aviation detachments of the czarist army, 
remained essentially missions which were accomplished in the 
First World War. However, the October socialist revolution 
breathed new life into the content of these missions and fighter 
tactics. 
  What did the first red military pilots hand down to their 
descendants? Massing of fighter aviation forces in decisive axes 
of action of troops, protecting cavalry elements of the Red 
Army, highly mobile for the times, in critical situations on the 
fronts, were developed and used widely in the fire of the civil 
war. Secrets of irresistible attacks of Soviet fighter pilots 
consisted of able maneuver, the use of concealment in the sun, 
haze, "dead" zones of observation and fire of enemy aircraft, 
rapid and surprise closing and commencement of fire. They 
conducted resolute and active combat actions, set up ambushes on 
raiding routes of enemy aviation, and bravely attacked even a 
numerically superior enemy. 
  After the end of the civil war, the missions and tactics of 
FA were formed on the basis of developing views of its combat 
utilization. It was considered the basic means of fighting for 
superiority in the air, and had the main mission of repelling, 
jointly with antiaircraft artillery, the raids of aviation 
attacking friendly forces. In the skies of Spain and China, over 
the Khalkhin-Gol river and in the war with the White Finns, the 
role of missions assigned to FA gradually increased. From the 
standpoint of improving tactics, air-to-air combat was 
characterized by the development of fire and tactical 
coordination in groups of fighters of different types. Usually 
the fast I-16 (fig. 1) [not reproduced] fighters joined battle 
first and forced the enemy to maneuver, then he was attacked by 
the I-15 (fig. 2) [not reproduced] maneuver aircraft. 
  The tactics of fighter aviation in these battles were 
enriched by diverse techniques of multiple-aircraft air-to-air 
combat, but many questions still awaited solution. Too few 
air-to-air battles were conducted, and in addition they were 
marked by some uniformity and usually broke up into battles of 
small groups or individual aircraft. With such uncoordinated 
actions it was hard to coordinate the efforts of pilots to 
achieve success. The division of fighters into fast and 
maneuverable aircraft ceased to be justified. For battle with 
new aircraft of the probable adversary, fast, highly 
maneuverable, well-armed machines were needed, but, from the 
experience of two years of war in Europe, no reasonable 
conclusions were drawn, and FA tactics were not revised. 
  Such are only a few fragments of the prehistory of FA 
tactics 
before the start of the Great Patriotic War. No one yet knew 
what the tactics of the coming war would be, the tactics which 
later more than one generation of pilots would turn to. 
  The basic tasks of fighter aviation when the war started 
were 
destruction of enemy aviation in air-to-air battles for air 
superiority, protection of troops and rear installations, 
support of combat actions of other arms of aviation, aerial 
reconnaissance, and actions against ground targets. Each of 
these missions had its own organization and its own modes of 
combat action, its own group of original tactical techniques. 
Since those days many generations of fighters have come and 
gone, but they all even now perform these tasks. Only the 
tactics have changed. Without considering these changes in 
strict chronological order, let us just follow how the content 
of combat missions of fighter aviation was improved at the 
turning points in the development of tactics. 
<H5>  1. In Battles For Air Superiority </H5>
  Air superiority became a necessity with the June dawn of 
forty-one, when the airplanes pelted by enemy bombs burned at 
our airfields. It was as vital as air to the troops, navy, and 
aviation, in order to halt the fascist invaders, to create for 
the attack planes and bombers the opportunity to deliver fighter 
strikes on the enemy. 
  The fighter pilots displayed mass heroism and unprecedented 
courage in the very first battles for air superiority. They 
resolutely attacked the enemy even when they were in the 
minority, sought to draw from their equipment everything which 
it could give, to gain victory at the cost of life itself. But 
the fascist "Messerschmitts" had a maximum speed of 500-550 
km/hr, and our I-15s and I-16s only 360-460 km/hr. There were 
still only a few new planes. Therefore, our fighters lacked the 
advantage of speed and consequently of vertical maneuver, and 
fought the air-to-air battles by maneuvering in the horizontal 
plane (banked turns). 
  I believe I am not revealing a secret when I say that the 
bravest pilot in a bad plane will be able to overcome an enemy 
ace whose machine is technically more sophisticated only on the 
condition that the latter misses the attack or makes mistakes in 
the battle. The battle cannot be won by heroism alone. It is 
hurtful and sad to recall how many of our pilots, brave boys, 
perished on those battles because their equipment was outmoded. 
  However, the military and technical advantages of the enemy 
were not the only reasons for the failures of the fighters. 
However paradoxical it might sound, one of the reasons for the 
situation that was created turned out to be the tactics 
themselves. Whose fault is it that the dense combat formations 
of fighters, the chief of which was the "wedge" of a three-plane 
flight, was detected by the enemy a long way off, and, most 
importantly, hindered the actions of the pilots? Whose fault is 
it that in such combat formations the pilots were forced to stay 
close to one another, to pay a lot of attention to keeping their 
place, which led to a reduction in vigilance? These tactical 
shortcomings were taken advantage of by the Hitlerites for their 
surprise attacks. 
  But why did this happen? The force of tradition made itself 
felt. For many years pilots had been taught to wage battle in 
banked turns, actions in battle formations that were not 
echeloned by altitude. The war dictated immediate and radical 
changes in tactics. In the harsh existence of the front, the 
enemy actions were studied closely, combat experience was 
accumulated, and there was an intense search for more effective 
tactical techniques. 
  We will not delve into all the ups and downs of development 
of tactics in the course of the war, but will mentally shift 
from these dramatic events to their concluding period. 
  Air superiority, which was first won in individual areas, 
then in larger ones, finally tended in our favor in air-to-air 
battles at Kuban, the battle of Kursk (1943), and subsequently 
was held firmly by Soviet aviation. Mass influx of new fighters 
to the front -- "Yakovlevs" and "Lavochkins" (fig. 3,4) [not 
reproduced] stripped the enemy of his former advantages. The 
dense formations of three-aircraft flights became a thing of the 
past. The pair was affirmed as basic fire and tactical unit . A 
battle formation of larger subunits was structured on the basis 
of pairs and usually consisted of a strike force and escort 
element or holding force (fig. 5). In an air-to-air battle the 
strike force played the role of the "sword" (search and attack), 
and the escort element was its reliable "shield." However small 
the fighter force was, it would always adhere to the division 
into "shield" and "sword." If the pilots encountered bombers 
escorted by fighters, the escort element sought to engage them 
in battle, and if there were none, they would attack the bombers 
along with the strike force. The strike was always delivered by 
those flights and pairs which proved to be in an advantageous 
position. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-04A>      Figure 5. Battle formation of fighters in expectation of battle </FIG>


  The tactics of fighter aviation received further development 
and were displayed most graphically in the concluding Berlin 
operation. Air superiority was assured through vigorous actions 
of fighters in the three main zones (fig. 6). Fighter forces, 
"hunters" operating in the first zone, reached the fascist 
airfields and destroyed the scrambling aircraft, sought out and 
destroyed small groups in the air, and upon encountering large 
groups would radio information about them, which would be used 
by fighters in other zones when they joined battle. The massing 
of forces, good organization of command and control, and high 
combat activeness of the flight personnel bore fruit: more than 
half of the combat aircraft belonging to the two German air 
fleets protecting Berlin were destroyed in air-to-air battles. 
The effectiveness of each combat sortie rose sharply. Thus the 
number of sorties of fighters per downed fascist aircraft in 
1945 was cut to a third in comparison with 1943, and on the 
average was 53 as opposed to 156. (TsAMO [Ministry of Defense 
Central Archives], F. 112, op. 158791, d. 1, l. 65.) 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-05A>      Figure 6. Fighter aviation battling for air superiority (from experience in the Berlin </FIG>

  Fighter aviation fought for air superiority along with 
attack 
and bomber aviation, which delivered massed strikes on aircraft 
at airfields, destroyed fuel and ammunition depots; long-range 
aviation operated against facilities of the aviation industry in 
the deep enemy rear. However, in those years air superiority was 
won primarily by fighters. It was in air-to-air battles that the 
greatest harm was inflicted on the enemy and fascist pilots 
perished or were captured. The advent of nuclear weapons soon 
after the end of the war radically changed views of the methods 
of attaining air superiority. Using nuclear missiles it became 
possible in mere minutes to deliver a strike of enormous 
destructive force against the most remote airfields. As a 
result, aviation will suffer losses which may lead to an 
immediate and sharp change in the correlation of forces. In this 
regard, many foreign specialists believe that the battle for air 
superiority may be fought without the active participation of 
fighter aviation. 
  Such views have long existed, but since they have not been 
tested in practice, the battle for air superiority has continued 
in numerous local wars, which were waged using only conventional 
weapons. And here the role of fighter aviation proved far 
different from that predicted by the skeptics. Despite their 
opinion, air-to-air battles developed with new force, and in 
each subsequent war they acquired new traits. Let us examine how 
fighter tactics changed from war to war. 
  The first air-to-air battles occurred in the skies of Korea 
seven years after the end of the Second World War. There the 
first-generation jet fighters MiG-15 (fig. 7) [not reproduced] 
and F-86 "Sabre" (fig. 8) [not reproduced] which possessed great 
subsonic speed, met one another. These battles were marked by 
the great scope of altitude and the sharply increased speeds of 
the aircraft, and demonstrated significant changes in tactics in 
a short time. 
  The fighters of the Korean People's Army (KPA), using the 
advantages of their aircraft over the "Sabres" in rate of climb, 
sought to fight using vertical maneuvers, while the American 
pilots preferred horizontal maneuvers and tried to shift the 
battles from high altitude to medium and low, where the 
advantages of the MiG-15 over the "Sabre" were reduced somewhat. 
However the KPA fighters attacked the adversary from above, from 
a steep dive, and then, using their exceptional rate of climb, 
gained altitude sharply and departed into the sun. Combat 
formations in groups became more and more dispersed, for 
otherwise they could not provide freedom of maneuver, the 
parameters of which increased sharply in jet aircraft. (See: 
Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushaya sila v Koreye [Air 
Power -- the Decisive Force in Korea], Izd. inostr. lit., 1959, 
pp 67-68) 
  Another ten years passed. The Vietnam War broke out. The 
MiG-17 and MiG- 21 (fig. 9,10) [not reproduced] fighters fought 
air-to-air battles with the F-3 "Phantom" (fig. 11) [not 
reproduced] under conditions of air superiority for American 
aviation, and this left an imprint on their tactics. Due to the 
low numerical strength of the fighter aviation opposing the 
aggressor, there were no large multiple-aircraft battles. The 
tactics of the Vietnamese pilots were structured on rapid and 
surprise attacks by pairs against the most vulnerable American 
aircraft. Air-to-air battles as a rule consist of one attack, 
which was performed following commands from ground control 
points, at maximum speed using the conditions of natural 
concealment. Such attacks added confusion and bewilderment to 
the actions of the American pilots. They tried to counter the 
Vietnamese fighters with various tactical techniques, but 
nothing new was thought up to evade the attacks except for 
energetic maneuver. 
  The battles for air superiority in the Arab-Israeli wars 
took 
a different course. In comparison with past wars, they were 
characterized by extensive use of feints and decoy actions, more 
dispersed combat formations, and increased tactical coordination 
between fighter subunits. 
  The light maneuver aircraft "Mirage"-3C and the heavier F-4 
"Phantom" took part in the air-to-air battles on the aggressor's 
side. The combat formations, as before, were dispersed and 
echeloned by altitude. However the disposition of forces had 
changed (fig. 12). The "Mirage"-3C fighters comprised the group 
luring the enemy to commit to battle, or decoy element. But the 
difficulty was that no one could say if this was a decoy or 
strike element. The tactics were reminiscent of a game of "cat 
and mouse," except that its outcome was different. The decoy 
element would approach the battle area at medium altitude, where 
they were quickly detected by ground radars of the Arabs, 
fighters were scrambled to intercept, while the strike was 
concealed at low altitude. When the Arab fighters tried to 
attack the decoy element, through feints the latter would create 
favorable conditions for a surprise attack of their strike 
force, which was invisible to the radar. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-06A>      Figure 12. Air-to-air battle using diversional maneuver </FIG>


  In the war in Lebanon (1982), when the Israeli air force was 
augmented with the more sophisticated American F-15 and F-16 
aircraft (fig. 13,14) [not reproduced], the tactics of 
air-to-air combat received further development (fig. 15). The 
light F-16 fighters would attack first. Armed with short-range 
"Sidewinder" missiles, they would covertly join with the Syrian 
fighters at low altitude from their rear hemisphere. The F-15 
fighters, which had intermediate-range "Sparrow" missiles, would 
strike from long range (25-30 km). Instead of "Mirages," the 
role of decoy elements would be played by drones, and command 
and control (target designation, retargeting, buildup of 
efforts) was provided from airborne command posts, whose role 
was played by the E-2C "Hawkeye" AWACS aircraft (fig. 16) [not 
reproduced]. Electronic warfare aircraft also operated in the 
interests of the fighters. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-07A>      Figure 15. Air-to-air battle of fighters in Lebanon (1982) </FIG>

  Today the battles of past years no longer fire our 
imagination. 
  Much has changed in the disposition of forces and in the 
tactics themselves of fighter aviation. What is the role of 
air-to-air battles in the struggle for air superiority today and 
in the future? Important military leaders and specialists abroad 
polemicize in their search for answers to this question, and the 
works of military science institutions are published. No one 
dares to question the importance of the problem, but all stress 
its complexity and contradictory nature. 
  In carefully studying the course of air-to-air battles in 
local wars and comparing their effectiveness with strikes 
against airfields, some western specialists conclude that under 
present-day conditions aviation on the ground is still the most 
vulnerable. This is explained by the fact that the power of 
strike elements possessing new systems of precision weapons has 
increased sharply, and modern aircraft are in the limited area 
of airfields and cannot get along without a runway with a hard 
artificial pavement, which is easily visible from the air. 
  And if we look at the problem from another aspect? After 
all, 
putting aviation at airfields which are in the depth of the 
enemy territory would be more difficult. The increase in the 
combat readiness of aviation units and subunits on the one hand, 
and the increase in the range of detection of the offensive air 
weapons on the other, has the result that now the time of 
scrambling the main aviation forces from the airfields is less 
than the flight time to target of the assault elements of the 
attacking aviation after their detection. Therefore aircraft can 
take off from the airfields and escape from the strike before it 
occurs. It has become more difficult to hurt aviation on the 
ground, since the planes are generally in quite reliable 
shelters, and it is more difficult to penetrate the air defense 
SAM barrier. 
  How should the battle for air superiority be waged so as to 
bring the greatest success? The final word on this has not been 
spoken, but clearly, on the basis of the contradictory nature of 
the problem, one cannot unequivocally approach its resolution: 
strikes on airfields or air-to-air battles? Too many factors 
influence the answer. There is basing, composition, and 
capabilities of aviation to achieve surprise, escape from a 
strike, the disposition of forces of the sides, and much else. 
Therefore the specific weight of strikes on airfields and 
air-to-air battles under various conditions and in different 
periods of combat actions may change over rather broad limits. 
But the interrelation and the interdependence of strikes and 
battles are strengthened under present-day conditions. Thus 
strikes on airfields, aviation command and control posts, and 
air defense create favorable conditions for actions of fighters 
over the adversary's territory and attainment of air superiority 
in strength, and successful air-to-air battles exert direct 
influence on the results of strikes on airfields, since the 
strike aviation is given the opportunity to operate under 
conditions of weakened enemy resistance. 
  There is another characteristic feature in the combat 
mission 
of fighter aviation in the battle for air superiority: its very 
concept is being expanded. Instead of a battle with the 
adversary's combat aviation, it includes destruction of early 
warning aircraft, airborne command posts, and elements of 
reconnaissance-strike complexes. If all of them patrolling in 
the air are not quickly destroyed, the enemy will be able to 
warn his aircraft in time and pull aircraft at airfields away 
from the strikes, then commit his fighters to battle. And this 
means that air targets which are diverse in type and nature of 
actions, the fighters must utilize different tactical techniques 
in battle. Therefore the battle with such targets is often 
included among the independent missions of fighter aviation. 
  Thus the battle for air superiority is inevitable, 
unavoidable, and does not depend on the type of combat action or 
our wishes, so consequently the air space in the foreseeable 
future will continue to be the arena for fierce battles and 
engagements. However, the battle for air superiority could be an 
independent mission for fighter aviation only in individual 
local wars. It performs this mission in repelling a surprise 
enemy incursion, protecting friendly forces, and supporting the 
combat actions of other aviation arms. Winning and holding air 
superiority will create favorable conditions and is this a kind 
of key which opens the way to accomplishment of other tasks? 
<H5>  . Fighters and Protected Troops </H5>
  A squadron over a battlefield. The ground heaves from the 
bursts of shells and mortars. Black columns of smoke from 
burning tanks rise heavenward. The pilots watch our infantry 
move forward through the fire, penetrating the smoke, to meet 
the enemy. Behind it are visible the artillery positions and 
concentrations of troops -- the targets of strikes by fascist 
bombers. The fighters race to the attack against nine "Junkers" 
about to drop their bombs on the protected troops. Then one 
after the other the enemy bombers burn and fall before the eyes 
of the infantrymen. 
  The Soviet soldiers had occasion to witness many such 
battles 
in the years of the Great Patriotic War. But it was also 
otherwise, especially at the start of the war, when friendly 
troops retreated under the onslaught of powerful enemy assault 
elements. Ask former soldiers if they often saw our fighters in 
the sky. All would answer "hardly at all." They remember the 
inordinate load which the unprotected troops experienced, the 
losses they incurred under the strikes of the fascist aviation 
because their protection from the air was not reliable enough, 
or was altogether absent. And this at a time when the 
adversary's aviation, interacting with ground troops, 
concentrated its efforts in the axis of their strikes and so 
"processed" our defense that it could no longer deter the enemy 
offensive. 
  Significant fighter aviation forces were required to 
accomplish the most important task of protecting troops, but 
there were obviously not enough. There were no reliable command 
and control systems, or the necessary experience. Combined-arms 
commanders were not sufficiently competent in effective use of 
the combat capabilities of the fighter aviation. After all, 
planes in the air are not tanks on the ground. The desire to 
protect as many targets as possible and uniformly disperse the 
forces of fighter aviation over the entire front led to their 
scattering, and hampered massing and maneuver. 
  But now imagine that the pilots had to detect and attack the 
enemy before he delivered strikes on the protected troops. 
Although the easily based fighters of those years were disposed 
on small dirt airfields, at times right next to the front line, 
they by no means always had time for the sortie. For timely 
interception of the adversary, airborne alert duty was 
organized, but it was necessary to protect the troops for long 
periods, and the time the pilots were in the zones was 40-50 
minutes. Requiring great expenditures of forces, motor operating 
time, and fuel, this mode of combat action condemned the 
fighters to passivity. Taking advantage of the fact that they 
were tied down to specific areas, the enemy could keep them busy 
in battle, or simply bypass these areas. 
  So what was left for the commanders to do who were 
responsible for protecting the troops? Either intercept from 
alert status on the ground, which did not allow a timely attack 
on the enemy, or airborne alert duty, by which you also gain 
little. There remained the sole correct way in the prevailing 
circumstances: improve resources and the system of command and 
control. 
  Meanwhile actual effectiveness at times did not correspond 
to 
best intentions. Only later, when radar entered the air forces, 
did this way bring perceptible results, and make it possible to 
abandon the continuous airborne alert duty. Commitment of 
fighters to battle from alert status on the ground became the 
basic method of combat action in protecting troops. Control of 
the fighters was implemented using radars, which in 1943 were 
introduced into the equipment tables of air armies and assigned 
to the fighter aviation corps. In 1944, 2,102 fighters were 
vectors to aerial targets from radar data, and 1,262 enemy 
aircraft were shot down. (See: Timokhovich, I.V. Operativnoye 
iskusstvo Sovetskikh VVS v Velikoy Otechestvennoy Voynye 
[Operational Art of Soviet Air Forces in the Great Patriotic 
War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1976, 283 pages.) 
  In addition, in order to beat the adversary to the punch in 
actions, the most proficient pilots began to enter his territory 
to areas where flights of fascist aircraft had been noted. Thus 
appeared, or more precisely was reborn, another method of combat 
action well known in Russian aviation, which was dubbed the 
"roving patrol." This method was very effective, but not the 
main one. Actions of the "hunters" were not tied to specific 
protected installations, and of course could not ensure 
reliability. 
  The "hunters" were free in their choice of time, routes, and 
mission profile. Operating in individual pairs, they 
inconspicuously crossed the front line at sectors where troop 
actions were less vigorous, encountered enemy aircraft at remote 
approaches to the protected installations, closed with them 
covertly, and launched surprise attacks. Actions of the 
"hunters" kept the Hitlerites in a constant state of tension, 
and sowed panic. High tactical proficiency was required of our 
pilots. The renowned aces recounted how carefully they prepared 
for each flight on the "hunt, and developed tactical techniques 
for search and battle in the depth of enemy territory. 
  By the end of the war the fighter aviation possessed 
adequate 
forces to protect troops, and a well-organized system of warning 
and command and control of fighters had developed, thanks to 
which the enemy aircraft were detected 12-15 minutes before the 
approach to protected troops. Command posts were able to commit 
new forces ahead of time, create numerical superiority over the 
adversary in decisive axes, and in the necessary time. 
Systematically and consistently the fighter aviation protected 
troops in areas of concentration, in staging areas for attack 
with breakthrough the enemy defense, and then shifted efforts to 
protection of mobile groups with their commitment to battle, and 
actions in the operational depth. Interception of the adversary 
from a ground alert status was intelligently combined with 
interception from airborne alert status and "roving patrol." 
Each of the modes of combat action of fighter infantry was 
necessary in its own way, convenient, and supplemented the 
others. 
  These modes have been retained to this day. Which of them 
should be preferred today? I do not believe this is an easy 
question, or that many of us could give a detailed answer to it. 
There are reasons for this: 
  --the troops as an object of protection have changed, the 
stability of their defense, the depth of disposition of combat 
formations, the mobility and fire power of air defense weapons, 
the capacity to quickly shift from defensive to counteroffensive 
actions, have changed; 
  --the range of protected targets against which the air 
adversary may deliver strikes, in the most remote areas using 
long-range precision weapons, has grown; 
  --dimensions of airspace surveyed by modern ground radars 
and 
airborne weapons radars have grown. 
  And now let us consider how these three essentially 
contradictory circumstances affect the choice of modes of combat 
action of fighter aviation. Obviously the first of them entails 
an increase in the dimensions of the required areas of 
protection of troops, a more dynamic situation than in the past, 
and the need to allow for the capabilities of ground air defense 
weapons; the second makes the troops more vulnerable, increases 
the importance and complexity of the given combat mission of the 
fighter aviation; and the third widens the capabilities of 
intercept of the adversary at remote perimeters. The latter 
circumstance demands clarification: at what distance from 
protected targets must fighters need to and have to intercept 
air targets? 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-09A>      Figure 17. Required points of engagement of fighters when protecting troops </FIG>

  Let us begin with the obvious (fig. 17). If enemy aircraft 
deliver a strike on targets with conventional uncontrolled 
bombs, then distance from the targets is characterized by the 
amount of carry of the bombs A, which all things being equal 
increases with increased velocity and altitude of their release, 
reaching values of several tens of kilometers. But the range of 
launch of air-to-ground missiles is already measured in hundreds 
of kilometers. Now we add these ranges to the dimensions of the 
targets to be protected rb, add radius of effect with nuclear or 
precision weapons Rp, and we determine the required range of the 
line of engagement of the adversary by the formula 
  Sp = A + rb + Rp 
  The lines thus calculated are essentially the final lines of 
destruction of the adversary. And this means the fighters must 
be committed to battle at a range (Sb) which ensures they can 
fight before the adversary reaches the lines we have calculated: 
  Sb = V x tb. 
  Now let us proceed to determine rational modes of combat 
action of fighter aviation from the other aspect. We will 
formulate two very important questions. The first is, will the 
fighters have time to meet the adversary at such remote lines? 
And second, what should be done all the same, if the answer to 
the first question is negative? 
  Clearly the points of engagement shown in fig. 17, 
guaranteeing safety of protected targets, are closely associated 
with the lines of detection of the adversary. They are separated 
by a distance which he covers in the time spent by the fighters 
on commitment to battle from the ground alert duty status or 
while in the air. 
  Now let us turn to the circumstances noted above, and solve 
the following problem. Let us assume that you are the commander. 
You have fighters at an airfield in full readiness to take off. 
The dimensions of your area of troop protection are large, and 
the adversary can use long-range missiles, but the range of his 
detection is adequate for timely interception. Clearly there is 
nothing to mull over, and you will make your decision for 
simultaneous or successive commitment of fighters to battle from 
ground alert status at predetermined lines. 
  Yet another exercise. You are the commander. The conditions 
are the same, but the adversary has been smart, and taking 
advantage of low altitude and tactical tricks, has been able to 
reduce the range of his detection. What should be done? You 
would like to intercept him with fighters on airfield alert 
duty. Of course you will estimate their capabilities to reduce 
the takeoff time, you may be saved by commitment of fighters to 
the battle in the forward hemisphere of the targets (a 
180-degree turn and pursuit will become unnecessary), but you 
might not too. Clearly you cannot manage without airborne alert 
duty here. 
  A final example. You are a pilot who detects a target at a 
given line, but it is maneuvering and using jamming. Can you 
shoot it down before it uses its long-range weapons? After all, 
the depth of the air-to-air battle is growing. 
  Is there a solution? There is. As before, it consists of a 
reasonable combination of modes of combat action. This does not 
allow us to ignore airborne alert, although its cost continues 
to be very high: sortie requirements are quickly expended, and 
the flight personnel rapidly exhausted. 
  What is the attitude of fighter aviation today to the 
"roving 
patrol?" Does this mode have a right to life, or is it an 
anachronism? After all, present-day control equipment and 
systems provide for vectoring of fighters from ground and 
airborne command posts against a quite large number of targets. 
The needs for "roving patrols" are not limited, and it is 
scarcely necessary to use them in the same value as in the years 
of the Great Patriotic War. But anything can happen in a combat 
situation: the adversary may deliver a strike on command and 
control posts, apply electronic jamming, infiltrate decoy groups 
of aircraft at different altitudes. And then the fighters will 
again resort to the old but tested mode, which has been called 
"independent search and destruction of aerial targets (hunt)." 
  The area of application of this mode is quite great. It 
makes 
it possible to intercept the adversary not only in a difficult 
situation but also at maximum distance from the protected 
targets, at low altitudes, where the best radars are helpless. 
Fighters with weapons radars and powerful long-range weapons 
will become a serious hazard to enemy aircraft in the depth of 
his territory. Therefore. independent search and destruction of 
targets is a mode of combat action which has not become a thing 
of the past, has not become outmoded. It continues to be 
relevant and is provided for in the combat regulations of the 
air forces of many countries. 
  As in the past, pilots search in the assigned areas in 
likely 
directions of flight of the adversary, using weapons radars and 
visual sighting. They are given complete freedom of action, but 
such fighter tactics encounter a number of problems: how to 
achieve secrecy of action over enemy territory, if it is covered 
by a continuous radar field; how to overcome the resistance of 
enemy air defense, and to avoid the destructive fire in 
continues zones of engagement of SAMs; how to be the first to 
detect high-speed targets and assume a favorable position for 
their attack without using ground or airborne command posts. 
  Alas, these problems have not been resolved even today. But 
then, the solution also depends on us. Thus, without laying 
claim to specific conclusions regarding the role and place of 
modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting troops 
under different conditions, let us try to imagine the following 
picture. 
  Fighters are assigned the mission of protecting troops. In 
making his decision, the commander, of course, allows for the 
expected nature of enemy actions, the possible range of his 
detection, the dimensions of the protected area, and marks off 
the points of engagement and zones of alert duty of the fighters 
(if they are not determined by the senior officer). He will not 
forget to also asses the composition of his own forces, and the 
capabilities of the system of command and control, i.e., 
everything on which his choice of modes of combat action will 
depend. 
  Upon receiving information on an impending mass raid, in 
accordance with his decision the commander puts the fighters in 
immediate readiness for takeoff, and if timely interception of 
targets at the planned lines is not assured (for example at low 
altitudes) he scrambles some of his forces to alert zones. Some 
minutes later, the other subunits begin to take off according to 
plans. They are given the mission of building up efforts of the 
earlier-scrambled fighters, concentrating them to destroy the 
most dangerous targets in the enemy grouping. Here there may be 
various surprises (unfavorable correlation of forces, unforeseen 
maneuver of individual targets, unsuccessful attacks of friendly 
pilots), and the command cannot manage without a reserve, which 
may be on the ground or in the air. 
  Leaving their airfield behind them, and then even their 
troops, the pilots go further to the set lines. They know that 
now the main thing is not to permit enemy strikes with 
long-range precision weapons against the protected targets. Then 
the first aircraft appear. The air-to-air battle begins. 
  Protection of troops continues. The enemy aircraft approach 
the zones of destruction of the SAM systems. The fighters must 
fight the battle in close coordination with them. How can their 
joint efforts be coordinated? How can fighters ensure their 
safety in zones of engagement of SAM complexes? We will return 
to these questions in chapter IV. 
  The raid is repelled, but the threat remains. You see, the 
enemy will shift to echeloned actions with small groups and 
individual planes. Here is just the place for independent search 
and destruction of air targets. The main forces of fighters will 
restore combat readiness for repeat sorties, but at this same 
time pair after pair of "hunters" will take off and proceed to 
the enemy rear. 
  However, our commander has not allowed for one serious 
circumstance, which escapes him in the earlier prevailing 
stereotypes. You see, protection of troops today is one of the 
components of accomplishing the general mission of foiling an 
enemy invasion. Here fighter aviation faces a completely new 
contradiction, arising from the essence of defensive military 
doctrine. On the one hand, fighters must intercept the air enemy 
at the far approaches to the protected targets, in order to 
prevent their launch of air-to-ground missiles, and, on the 
other, the points of engagement are bounded by the state border 
until the fact of attack becomes obvious. But this is still not 
all. For some amount of time the protected troops will be forced 
to repel the attack of the adversary, and then shift to 
counteroffensive actions. Thus organization of protection and 
modes of combat action of fighter aviation vary according to the 
conditions of the ground situation. 
  How can we compensate for these unfavorable factors? They 
confront commanders of all levels with the urgent need to have 
significant forces of fighters in the optimal combat readiness 
to protect troops, to execute maneuvers along the front and in 
depth to create the necessary correlation of forces in areas 
where destruction of enemy aircraft before their launch of 
missiles is still possible. Proceeding from the NATO concept of 
"engaging second echelons (reserves)" troops must be protected 
to the entire depth of their disposition. 
  Thus protection of troops remains a most important combat 
mission of fighter aviation, which it accomplishes with diverse 
modes of combat actions. The use of flexible tactics makes it 
possible for the fighters to intercept the adversary at any 
altitude, in any portion of the protected region, to quickly 
concentrate efforts in remote approaches to the targets, and to 
act beyond the limits of the continuous field of friendly radar. 
<H5>  3. Supporting Other Aviation Arms </H5>
  "I receive the mission with a group of pilots accompanying 
the `Petlyakovs' (Pe-2 -- diver bomber). We fly to the region of 
Belgorod to bomb the enemy airfield, where his `Junkers' are 
based. The commander warned us that the airfield was strongly 
defended by antiaircraft artillery, and there were 
`Messerschmitts' on patrol aloft. Soon the group of bombers 
approached the airfield. We took off at their signal. I had to 
attentively watch the sky and structure the combat formation so 
that the German AA gunners could not separate us from the 
`Petlyakovs.' The main goal was to hit the airfield. Now it was 
ahead of us. At the edge was a group of Junkers. The Pe-2 
dropped their bombs on the move. The smoke from the explosions 
covered the airfield. The Junkers took off in disarray. And our 
bombers and fighters attacked them at takeoff, destroying them 
in the air. The commander of the group of Petlyakovs radioed me 
that the mission was accomplished, it was time to go home. I 
ordered the fighters to cover the group of Petlyakovs with 
special care from the flanks, where the bombers were more 
vulnerable. We left the airfield quickly, disappearing as 
suddenly as we had appeared." (Kozhedub, I.--"Vernost Otchiznye" 
[Loyalty to the Fatherland], M.: Voyenizdat, 1975, pp 202-204.) 
  This excerpt from the memoirs of three-time Hero of the 
Soviet Union I. Kozhedub uses the example of just one frontline 
episode to show the content of the main method of combat actions 
of fighters in supporting other aviation arms in the Great 
Patriotic War, direct escort to the target and back. In those 
years subunits and units which required protection flew 
themselves to the fighter airfield or met them at a set line, 
and then flew together, repelling attacks on the fighters by 
enemy fighters. In turn the crews of the protected aircraft used 
radio, signal flares, or tracers to inform the fighters of the 
appearance of the enemy, and jointly with them delivered fire on 
the enemy aircraft with their onboard weapons. 
  In preparing for a sortie to protect bombers, lines were 
determined for the start and stop of the escort, formation of a 
common battle formation, procedures of action when encountering 
enemy fighters. At the same time, in order to raise reliability 
of protection at the approach of the bombers to the targets, 
where they usually encountered intensive resistance from enemy 
fighters, provision was made for timely arrival of some of our 
fighters at these targets, racing ahead of the protected 
aircraft. 
  In addition to bombers, attack aircraft, which delivered 
strikes on enemy troops, also required reliable protection from 
enemy fighters. Coordinating units often were deployed at the 
same airfield or were neighbors. This offered broad 
opportunities for personal contacts to clarify details of the 
coordination. 
  When protecting attack aircraft, the fighters usually formed 
two groups: a strike force, which followed behind and above the 
protected aircraft at the limits of visibility, and a local 
protection force, which was on the flanks and behind the attack 
aircraft (fig. 18). Upon approach to the target, the strike 
force repelled attacks by enemy fighters trying to impede the 
strike, and engaged them in battle if they patrolled over the 
target. The local protection force drew away the attack of those 
fighters which broke through to the attack aircraft through the 
barrier of the strike force, and if possible jointly with the 
attack aircraft they suppressed the fire of the enemy 
antiaircraft battery. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-12A>      Figure 18. Fighter cover of Il-2 ground-attack aircraft during the Great Patriotic War </FIG>


  These tactics of fighters in protecting bombers and attack 
aircraft were retained through the entire war. The details might 
change, but the characteristic features remained joint combat 
formations, close coordination with protected aircraft, 
attachment of the fighters to them, and defensive battle. 
  Joint combat formations strengthened crew confidence in 
safety of their actions, promoted successful repulse of enemy 
attacks, and allowed them to concentrate attention on searching 
for targets and striking at them. But although fighters over 
enemy territory could not count on information about the air 
situation from the ground, and the buildup of forces in battle, 
they operated ably and resolutely, bravely closed with the 
enemy, and swiftly attacked him, not allowing him to get through 
to the protected aircraft. 
  Later on, with an increase in the numerical strength of 
fighter aviation, it began to practice a combination of modes of 
combat action. In addition to forces allocated for escort, 
groups were created to clear away enemy fighters, which left for 
the target region 10 to 15 minutes before the start of the 
strike and joint battle with them (sweep of air space). Groups 
were also formed to blockade airfields of enemy fighters, and 
reserve groups. They all operated according to a single plan 
during delivery of massed strikes by aviation. 
  However, the main mode of combat actions remained direct 
escort of attack aircraft and bombers, which achieved a high 
level of sophistication. Preparation of fighters to perform the 
missions was carried out jointly with the crews of supported 
aircraft and ended with a joint rehearsal of the combat flight, 
and after landing a similar general critique was conducted. If 
possible the fighters were based with attack aircraft at the 
same airfield. 
  In the postwar years, the importance of such effective 
escort 
decreased. As early as the Korean war, despite the allocation of 
a significant amount of fighter aviation forces, the U.S. 
bombers escorted by it suffered heavy losses. Thus in just one 
raid (30 October 1951), in which eight B-29 bombers and 90 
escort fighters participated, pilots of the Korean People's Army 
destroyed all the bombers. (NEWSWEEK, 1961, 30 November). 
Subsequently, the cases of high bomber losses became more 
frequent. Not without surprise, foreign military specialists 
conclude that this was not a regrettable exception from the 
law-governed regularities of tactics, but rather a law-governed 
regularity itself: direct escort had not justified itself. 
  The prevailing situation had two causes: the growth in 
speeds 
and parameters of maneuver was making itself felt more and more 
in joint flight. Analyzing frontline examples (fig.18), one can 
see that fighters executing an energetic maneuver did not lose 
visual contact with the protected group. They had a great 
advantage in speed over them, could shift freely from one flank 
to the other, and concentrate forces in the threatened axis. 
  With the decrease in speed differences and increase in 
maneuver parameters, the situation changed. In addition it 
became more difficult for the fighters to be at intervals and 
separations of certain visual observations of the protected 
aircraft. Therefore, they were forced to pay more attention to 
visual contact with them than to the search for the air enemy. 
But most importantly, being tied down in this way deprived the 
pilots of the initiative, the choice of the favorable moment to 
join battle, and freedom of maneuver. 
  Indeed, just as a sentry cannot leave his post and go away 
from the protected installation, an escort fighter cannot 
abandon his place in the battle formation. But even a simple 
turn of 180 degrees would separate the fighter from the group. 
The pilots were told to join battle only in the event of urgent 
necessity, to execute short maneuvers in order to be able to 
resume their place in the combat formation. Any decoy actions, 
feints and other tactical techniques were ruled out, but all 
this did not solve the problem. 
  A little later the capabilities for direct escort were 
narrowed even more. This time the reason was the entry of 
air-to-air guided missiles into the armament of the enemy 
fighters. They had a range of launch much exceeding the range of 
visual contact of the fighters with their supported aircraft. 
For timely repulse of attacks by an enemy using such missiles, 
it was necessary to dispose the escort fighters beyond visual 
contact with the strike forces. But the advent of all-aspect 
missiles led to the need to defend them from all directions. 
Direct escort was transformed into patrol escort. 
  The transition to patrol escort somewhat broadened the 
capabilities of the fighters, but the basic drawbacks (being 
tied to their place in the battle formation, constricted 
maneuver) remained. In addition, in order to control a common 
battle formation, in which the separations and intervals 
significantly exceeded the range of visibility, required the 
assistance of control points from the ground, which became 
impossible over enemy territory. Therefore, hopes for patrol 
escort proved to be vain, but leaving bombers without fighters 
following them was even worse. 
  What next? Before answering, let us trace how conditions 
change for providing protection of subunits and units of strike 
aviation with fighter forces. New aircraft entering its armament 
had higher performance in terms of speed and altitude, and 
adequate power plant. This allowed them to fly to targets at 
high speed and maneuver in a great range of altitudes. But 
fighters protecting bombers continued to be restricted in 
maneuver; in particular it was necessary to repel attacks of 
enemy aircraft armed with guided missiles, from great range. 
Therefore some aviation commanders, assuming that high speed, 
maneuverability, and a great range of flight altitudes had 
become the basic protection from enemy fighters, wondered if 
protection of strike aviation by the forces of fighter aviation 
was necessary at all. 
  It is not hard to see that the proponents of such views in 
fact were denying not the need for protection of strike 
aviation, but only one of the modes of combat action of 
fighters, escort. 
  The traditional mode of fighter escort of aircraft of 
tactical and strategic aviation convincingly demonstrated it 
weak points back in the Vietnam war. The American press reported 
that these aircraft, flying with a high bombing payload, could 
not maintain a speed of more than 890 km/hr, and, despite their 
escort by fighters en route and in the target region, were very 
vulnerable to North Vietnamese fighters. Diving through the 
battle formations of escort fighters at supersonic speed, they 
confidently downed the protected aircraft. Although the American 
pilots knew about this tactical technique, they had a difficult 
time countering it. (ORDNANCE, 1976, No 11-12). 
  Later on the Americans changed to supporting strike aircraft 
not only by an escort but also by sending out screening 
elements, through patrols of long-range intercept forces in the 
axes of possible appearance of enemy fighters, and also by 
bottling up their airfields (fig. 19). All tactical groups move 
initially in a common battle formation, and then, moving ahead 
of the strike forces, they assume a position shown in the figure. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-14A>      Figure 19. Fighter support of other aviation arms (from experience of Vietnam War). Tactical </FIG>


  I know that in analyzing figure 19, some readers will smile 
skeptically: could we use the experience of Vietnam today? There 
an aggressor possessing a significant superiority over the North 
Vietnamese air forces could so lavishly expend his own fighter 
forces. What place is there for escort, even patrol escort, if 
there is no such superiority? 
  For an answer to these questions, let us turn to more recent 
events. Ten years later in the Lebanon conflict of 1982, Israeli 
F-15 and F-16 fighters abandoned their joint flights and any 
contact with strike groups. In place of the traditional escort, 
so inconvenient for the fighters, interaction with them occurred 
in the time and along lines at the boundaries of the strike 
region. Before arrival of the strike forces at the targets, the 
fighters moved forward and formed multi-tiered screens. There 
was one other factor promoting such actions. This entire region 
was under radar surveillance from an airborne command post (E-2C 
Hawkeye), which monitored the air situation and corrected the 
actions of the strike forces and fighter cover. 
  Today those problems which were resolved in protecting 
strike 
forces in local wars, are history, are partially forgotten and 
overshadowed by new problems. The increase in capabilities of 
strike aviation, but mainly the changed conditions of combat 
action due to the demands of defensive doctrine, have exerted a 
definitive influence on their onset. While complying with the 
principle of defensive sufficiency, which provides for the 
minimal necessary amount of military equipment and personnel to 
repel a possible aggression, despite the high performance of the 
aircraft, the proficiency and vigilance of the commanders, one 
cannot count on superiority of forces. In addition, when 
delivering a retaliatory-meeting strike or retaliatory strike, 
aviation will meet the resistance of an unsuppressed or weakly 
suppressed enemy air defense system and its fighters. 
  So what today is the role of fighter aviation, given the 
current level and quality of aviation equipment, what modes can 
ensure successful protection of strike aviation operating en 
masse in dispersed battle formations, using long-range precision 
weapons and powerful EW equipment? 
  The growing danger to strike aviation from enemy fighters on 
the one hand, and the high combat properties of 
fourth-generation fighters on the other, undoubtedly will raise 
the role of fighter aviation, but depend on further improvement 
in the modes of its combat action. One can scarcely assume that 
all is evident here. After all, the search for new ways in any 
sphere of activity is always associated with resolution of a 
number of problems. In the sphere of protection of strike 
aviation by fighter forces, today one can discern at least three 
primary problems: 
  - How to eliminate the element of "delay" inherent in the 
nature of defense, and ensure adequate readiness of fighter 
aviation (and of strike aviation) for protection in multivariant 
conditions? Unreadiness, slowness to make decisions or to 
scramble fighters may lead to a loss of combat capacity even 
before the start of a retaliatory strike. 
  - How to ensure electronic compatibility of onboard 
electronics of the protected aircraft and the weapons radars of 
the fighters? The weakly perceptible interference to weapons 
radars in protecting individual small groups of bombers proves 
significantly stronger in massed strikes of aviation, when it 
operates in large groups, and [such interference] may seriously 
complicate the air situation for the covering fighters. 
  - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation, and 
particularly those of long-range aviation, delivering strikes on 
remote targets deep in the enemy rear? 
  The first of these problems is resolved in the general 
context of raising the combat readiness of fighter aviation to 
repel aggression, the second is a field for military engineer 
solutions, the third deserves detailed discussion. 
  We know that until recently protection of long-range 
aircraft 
was possible only when they were flying through the pre-frontal 
zone. The reason for this was the comparatively small tactical 
radius of action of the fighters. Then the bombers had to 
overcome the enemy air defense independently, relying on their 
onboard EW equipment and defensive armament. 
  With the advent of Su-27s, which one can rightly call 
long-range fighters (maximum flight range 4,000 km), in the 
fighter armament, the situation has now changed. Potential 
opportunities have appeared for protection of aviation en route 
to the targets to the launch lines of air-to-surface missiles 
and back. To a significant degree the capabilities designed into 
different aircraft systems to observe the air space, determine 
the relative coordinates of the fighters and the protected 
aircraft at long range, and the capabilities of commanders to 
control wingmen in a multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle have 
been enhanced. 
  However, potential opportunities are still not reality. In 
order to realize them, it is necessary to develop the most 
beneficial modes and variants of fight at various altitudes, and 
in the future to assimilate airborne refueling of fighters, and, 
no less important, high proficiency and training of pilots, 
their ability to take full advantage of the new capabilities of 
the equipment. 
  But this is only one aspect of the problem. There is 
another. 
The increase in range and the duration of flight has a negative 
influence on the functional state and working capacity of the 
crews of all aircraft, especially one-seaters. It becomes ever 
more difficult to "conquer space and time." But the literature 
devoted to such questions still modestly avoids this aspect. But 
can one fail to allow for such negative factors as hypodynamia, 
long hours spent in the flight gear and special equipment in a 
constricted working posture, the impossibility of meeting 
natural needs, etc. After all, this leads to muscle fatigue, the 
onset of painful sensations, reduction in activeness of mental 
processes. And this in the depth of enemy territory, where the 
air situation is filled to the limit with critical, stressful 
situations, and where complications cannot be avoided without 
maintaining the work capacity of the pilots at the very highest 
level! 
  Further automation of the processes of aircraft and weapons 
control, development of combat decision-making algorithms in 
standard situations, the inculcation in the pilots of high 
morale, aggressiveness, and psychological qualities, prevention 
of discomfort -- compliance with the preflight regimen of rest 
and nourishment, the choice of size and adjustment of the flight 
gear, creation of special medications, urinals... one can 
enumerate and enumerate such measures for escape from a critical 
situation. But we are more interested in the development of 
modes of combat action of fighter aviation in protecting strike 
aviation. 
  Indisputably we cannot discard the experience of the past, 
and of exercises conducted in our times. This experience, with 
allowance for the capabilities of modern fighter aircraft, shows 
that a concentration of efforts of fighter aviation on the 
protection not of individual groups, but of the entire aviation 
element in the air, in accordance with its operational-tactical 
structure, with strict delimitation of actions in terms of time 
and lines, is most preferable. Here, within the framework of the 
air strike to be delivered, and for its entire depth, the 
fighter groups can move in an echelon to break through the air 
defenses, sweeping the air space, and combine this mode of 
combat action with screens in the air. The latter can move in 
the direction of the airfields from which the appearance of 
enemy fighters is expected. Such a combination of modes of 
combat action to some degree promotes economy of fighter forces, 
and consequently corresponds to the principle of defensive 
sufficiency. 
  As for patrol escort of strike forces, although it is being 
improved on a new basis, it requires the recruitment of large 
fighter forces, and can be adequately effective when there are 
reliable resources for observation of the air situation and 
control of the fighters (e.g., AWACS planes), and also when good 
electronic compatibility of avionics of the protected aircraft 
and fighters is achieved. 
  It goes without say that along with improvement of these 
traditional modes of combat action of fighter aviation, the very 
conditions of protection force a new look at the capabilities of 
fighters, and a quest for other modes. One of them might be 
decoy (distracting) actions of small forces (pairs, flights) of 
fighters over a wide front, in order to complicate the enemy's 
air situation and scatter efforts of manpower and resources of 
his air defense. Routes, altitudes, and time of flight of the 
fighters should be chosen so that the enemy cannot retarget his 
fighters, scrambling to intercept decoys, against strike forces. 
Maneuvering energetically, they will also help aviation to 
overcome SAM resistance, which constitutes no less of a threat 
to it. But it is important that fighters operating as decoy 
elements also have equipment to generate active and passive 
jamming. 
  So what combination of modes of combat action should we 
consider to be rational? It all depends on the specific 
situation. Let us assume that the fighters are given the mission 
of supporting the combat actions of a subunit or unit in 
delivery of a strike against a target in the depth of enemy 
territory. Will the protected aircraft operate at high altitude 
or low outside the zones of visibility of ground radars, over a 
region with strong enemy air defense, or in a zone where it is 
suppressed? What resistance is expected from enemy fighters, 
will friendly forces be enough for a patrol escort? All these 
and other factors of the situation must be taken into account by 
the commander making the decision. However, in all cases he must 
precisely coordinate the actions of his different tactical 
forces with the actions of the supported subunit or unit, 
clarify the route, the mission profile, the time of takeoff and 
arrival at the target of the strike, procedures for flight to 
the target and over the target. Otherwise, even the best modes 
of combat action of the fighters will have little effectiveness. 
  Here one should allow for one other circumstance. One has to 
be a great optimist to assume that by attacking first the 
aggressor will not be able to put out of commission the great 
part of the fighter control posts, create gaps in the continuous 
radar field of the defending side. Therefore, while in the past 
integrated use of modes of combat action were planned for over 
the enemy territory, now it becomes necessary also over friendly 
forces, with minimal participation of ground posts in command 
and control. 
  Further development of the modes of combat action of fighter 
aviation is a continuous process, reflecting complex, largely 
contradictory and still unsettled tendencies in the nature of 
use of strike aviation, in the improvement of the air defense 
system opposing it, and in the growth of combat capabilities of 
the fighters themselves. I will not take the risk of making such 
predictions. The influence of many factors still remains 
unknown, and now only some of them can be designated, for 
example: 
  - How to protect aircraft of strike aviation from 
prospective 
tactical fighters, armed with long and intermediate range 
missiles, capable of launching them simultaneously against 
several bombers. 
  - How to protect aircraft with reduced signatures, developed 
by low- signature technology ("stealth" technology, as it is 
called abroad), without giving them away by one's own position. 
  All this testifies to the fact that the modes of combat 
action of fighter aviation in protecting strike aviation are 
again on the eve of changes. 
<H5>  4. In Aerial Reconnaissance </H5>
  A pair of YaK-7 fighters took off for reconnaissance of 
fascist tanks. The adversary was protecting the region of their 
concentration with antiaircraft weapons, and his fighters 
patrolled continuously in the air. Under such conditions, it was 
hard for the multi-seat scout aircraft to penetrate to the 
target. That was the way fighters were doing the reconnaissance. 
  The front line was crossed. The pair leader scrutinized the 
winding ribbons of country roads and woods while the wingman 
watched the sky. Steep climb, dive, turn left, right... There 
were the block boxes, hiding at the woodline. There were many of 
them, they were camouflaged and hard to see, but the leader made 
a count. The air defense gunners were quiet, apparently so as 
not to give away the position of the tanks, but the wingman saw 
four Messerschmitts which were already turning for the attack. 
The scouts could not get tied up in battle. Ably maneuvering, 
the escaped their pursuit. However, back home quickly with the 
valuable information... 
  Fighter/scouts conducted aerial reconnaissance in the 
tactical depth of the enemy chiefly through visual observation. 
They moved to their reconnaissance targets covertly and 
unexpected. The proximity of basing to the front line, and the 
flight speed, higher than that of the multi-seater scout planes, 
allowed the fighters to rapidly perform the aerial 
reconnaissance and return to their airfield, although even 
before the war it was thought that fighter aviation could be 
called on to perform aerial reconnaissance only if it did not 
harm accomplishment of basic combat missions. At the start of 
the war, when our reconnaissance aviation suffered heavy losses, 
the reconnaissance data of the fighters was successively used to 
deliver crushing strikes on the enemy. 
  "The scout himself has a hard time determining the value of 
the information he brings sometimes," three-time Hero of the 
Soviet Union A. Pokryshkin recalled one of his scouting sorties 
in November 1941, when large forces of Hitlerites in Von 
Kleist's tank group managed to evade surveillance of our 
reconnaissance. "But the grouping of German tanks that I found 
proved such an important `find' that they talked about it in the 
staff for a whole week... Kleist's group did not succeed in 
delivering the surprise strike on our troops." (Pokryshkin, A.I. 
Nebo voyny [The Skies of War], M.: Voyenizdat, 1966, p 158.) 
  Many such episodes also occurred in the subsequent war 
years. 
Fighter/scouts of the 163rd Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment in 
the Belorussian offensive operation on 1 July 1944 detected 
about 600 to 700 vehicles, more than 800 carts, and up to 20,000 
hitleites at the crossing of the Berezina river in the region of 
Shevernychi. This sortie had very important consequences. "I 
will always remember the terrible pictures of our destruction," 
testified one imprisoned fascist soldier after they were 
subjected to a fierce air strike based on reconnaissance data. 
(TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l. 18; op. 4800, d. 71, l. 
184.) 
  The development of tactics of aerial reconnaissance was 
dynamic and at times unpredictable in the postwar years. Its 
conditions and capabilities changed rapidly, but tactical 
techniques of fighters were always aimed at resolving two 
interrelated problems: uncovering the targets of reconnaissance, 
which were becoming smaller and smaller, and mobile, and 
overcoming the resistance of the enemy air defense, which was 
growing swiftly with the advent of all-weather interceptors and 
SAMs. 
  Uncovering small and camouflaged targets posed a special 
difficulty for the fighters. In contrast to the specialized 
scout planes, they did not have different kinds of 
reconnaissance equipment on board, and therefore could not 
detect objects from their IR radiation, operation or electronic 
equipment, and other such tell-tale signs. As in the war years, 
the basic method of aerial reconnaissance for the fighters was 
visual observation. But with the transition of fighter aviation 
from piston to jet aircraft, the time of possible observation of 
targets, especially at low altitude, was sharply reduced, and 
the maneuverability of the fighters was degraded. In the time 
spent in executing turns, steep climbs, which now had 
significantly greater spatial dimensions, the scouts drew 
further away from their targets than they had previously. 
  Overcoming enemy air defense in aerial reconnaissance is 
unavoidable, since the fighters have to enter enemy territory. 
With distance from friendly forces, they were no longer observed 
by command and control post radars, and therefore were deprived 
of the opportunity of receiving specific commands for evasion of 
antiaircraft fire and to avoid encountering enemy fighters. 
  Thus fighters did not have time to search for and identify 
targets at low altitude, and switching to medium and high 
altitudes increased their vulnerability to enemy air defense 
assets. It was necessary to find a solution to the prevailing 
contradiction, and it was found chiefly through the development 
of new types of maneuvers. One of them is shown in figure 20. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-17A>      Figure 20. High-speed reconnaissance of small objective </FIG>


  The fighters would approach the target at extremely low 
altitude, concealing themselves in the terrain relief, and 
conducted observation using a climbing turn, examining the 
target in the direction of the turn (fig. 20a). The observation 
time was increased, but if it was not possible to completely 
uncover the target and "tie" it to the map, the observation was 
continued in a climbing spiral (fig. 20b). This maneuver was 
simultaneously an evasion of antiaircraft fire. 
  Let us move on to today. In studying the experience of local 
wars, western military specialists believe that it is almost 
impossible for aerial scouts to achieve surprise when flying in 
a continuous radar field of the adversary, so they concluded 
that maximal involvement of fighters in aerial reconnaissance 
was necessary, due to their capablity of operating in a 
difficult combat environment more successfully than other 
aircraft. In their opinion, fighter/scouts could be assigned to 
obtain data about the enemy on the battlefield, and in the 
tactical depth in the interests of ground forces, and also 
followup reconnaissance of targets before delivery of strikes, 
and guidance of aviation strike forces to the targets they 
detect. Here it was recommended that fighters be assigned 
acquisition of reconnaissance data in those cases when great 
precision of information was not necessary, or if it was 
necessary to check dubious data, clarify information about 
targets detected by other types of reconnaissance. (Signal, 
1984, No. 1). 
  So what are the tactics of fighter/scouts today? They 
generally operate in pairs. The basic method of reconnaissance 
remains the traditional visual observation. However with the 
increased complexity of conditions and targets of 
reconnaissance, a tendency toward supplementing this method with 
others has been noted: aerial photography and the use of 
electronics. For this the fighters may carry suspended 
containers with photographic, IR, and optoelectronic apparatus, 
the makeup of which is determined before takeoff in accordance 
with the content of the assigned reconnaissance mission. 
  Clearly the integrated use of methods of aerial 
reconnaissance expands the possibilities of the fighters to 
accomplish it, allows them to accomplish more difficult and 
extensive tasks, but the search for targets has by no means 
become less difficult. It suffices to put a canopy-type cover 
over the target, to lay down a smokescreen, or simply to light a 
fire nearby, and the target will become invisible to 
photographic or IR equipment. The search for camouflaged targets 
therefore still demands the appropriate tactical techniques and 
a combination of them with techniques for overcoming enemy air 
defense. The scouts are forced to constantly change course, to 
execute maneuvers to avoid fighters, foil missile guidance, and 
all this must not interfere with observation of the targets. 
  There are more than enough techniques of aerial 
reconnaissance, but their general features include energetic 
maneuvering in the horizontal and vertical planes, arrival at 
targets from extremely low altitude, and from axes not expected 
by the enemy, the use of the weak aspects of his air defense. 
But this means that fighter/scouts must study the situation in 
detail in which they must operate, know how to find their 
bearings well in the terrain, know the tell-tale signs of 
various targets, where they are located, their status and nature 
of functioning. 
  These demands were also imposed on fighter/scouts in the 
past, but today other and higher demands are imposed on them, as 
on other aerial scouts. This is understandable. The problem of 
providing complete and reliable information to troops and 
aviation has become too difficult and multi-faceted, the number 
of targets has grown sharply, and they must be observed with 
great frequency. 
  It is not worth considering all the requirements affecting 
aerial reconnaissance as a whole; I shall allow myself to dwell 
only on one, the most important of them -- timeliness of 
reconnaissance. Even the most complete and reliable data cannot 
be used if they arrive late. Enemy missile complexes discovered 
by scouts can fire their missiles, enemy aircraft can take off 
from airfields before strikes can be made against them. And 
indeed, other targets in the time from their detection until the 
delivery of strikes against them can change their location, the 
strike forces must spend a long time looking for them, structure 
additional maneuvers for the strike, and this leads to loss of 
surprise and the negative consequences that entails. 
  Aerial reconnaissance undoubtedly is a specific task 
demanding special training of flight personnel, and it is 
assigned chiefly to non-organic, pre-trained subunits of 
fighters. However it would not be excessive for all pilots to 
constantly train at the conduct of en-route aerial 
reconnaissance. 
  Lofty responsibility is placed on fighters in the conduct of 
reconnaissance. For the pilots' commanders organizing it expect 
speed of action both in the acquisition and in the delivery of 
data. Decisions are made on their basis, troops go into battle, 
aviation is scrambled from airfields. The more dynamic and tense 
the situation, the stronger the weapons, and the greater the 
damage they may inflict on the enemy, the higher responsibility 
of scouts for undelivered strikes, or strikes delivered against 
decoy targets. 
  In order to reduce the time required for reconnaissance, 
fighters are on alert duty at airfields, in constant readiness 
for sortie, and in the most tense periods of combat action, may 
pull alert duty in the air (zones). But even these measures may 
prove insufficient. With further intensification of demands for 
timeliness of reconnaissance, the issue will be combining it 
with strikes against detected targets. This means that 
fighter/scouts must know how to precisely and accurately destroy 
ground targets. 
<H5>  5. Fire Crowns the Reconnaissance </H5>
  The mission was an urgent one: the squadron of Yak-7 
fighters 
was to deliver a strike on a column of Hitlerite vehicles and 
infantry based on the data of aerial reconnaissance. The column 
was a large one, no less than 120 units. Detected by scouts some 
15-20 minutes earlier, it was moving swiftly westward. In 
addition there were woods all around, and the fascists could 
camouflage themselves. There was no time to lose, and the 
squadron was already in the air. Its battle formation, according 
to the commander's decision, consisted of a strike force and a 
covering force. By relieving one another, they could take turns 
attacking the target and provide mutual protection from enemy 
fighters. The leader saw the target from far off, a long line of 
vehicles on a narrow road. A steep turn and the pilots raced to 
the attack against the vanguard of the column. Fire! The lead 
vehicles blazed up and poured out smoke, an enormous "plug" 
formed on the road, which had no detours, and more and more 
vehicles drew up. The covering force replaced the strike force... 
  This episode occurred on 12 July 1944 in the Belorussian 
offensive operation. (TsAMO, F. 319, op. 4798, d. 186, l. 
19-20). At that time the Soviet air forces had long held air 
superiority, the activity of the Hitlerite aviation had 
diminished, and fighters were called on more and more for 
delivery of strikes against concentrates of enemy personnel and 
equipment. 
  The tactical techniques of the fighters largely were 
identical to those of the Il-2 attack aircraft. The pilots 
strove to attack the enemy unexpectedly from out of the sun or 
from low altitude, in order that the fascists not have time to 
scatter to the sides of the roads and open fire, and they 
distributed targets in the strike objective beforehand. Most 
convenient were attacks from a chandelle [boyevoy razvorot] (the 
wing and fuselage of the aircraft did not cover the target). 
Repeated attacks were made with additional maneuvers, which were 
determined depending on the nature of resistance of the target 
(return fire, dispersion, or camouflage). 
  Naturally time has left its mark on accomplishment of this 
combat mission by fighter aviation. First of all, the speed and 
maneuver characteristics have changed, the armament is more 
powerful, and the range and accuracy of engagement of targets 
has increased. Second, the area air defense has been 
strengthened, but to use certain weapons' systems, after missile 
launch, fighters require some time to continue flight toward the 
target, and this increases their vulnerability to SAM fire. 
Third, the ground targets themselves have changed. There are now 
very many of them, ones which were unknown in the Great 
Patriotic War. Missile launchers, radar, SAM, multiple rocket 
launcher positions, helicopters on landing pads -- all these are 
small, camouflaged targets which can change their position 
quickly, and it is not so easy to identify and engage them. But 
these targets are weakly armored, and can be destroyed by 
fighter weapons. 
  These three circumstances cannot but influence the 
development of fighter tactics. However, as in the past, the 
fighters operate against ground targets when it does not harm 
accomplishment of their basic combat missions. Otherwise, this 
would contradict the basic purpose of fighter aviation. Whereas 
during the conduct of aerial reconnaissance, pilots have to 
combine this with delivery of strikes against moving columns of 
enemy troops and combat equipment, when supporting other 
aviation arms, air defense assets will be possible targets, if 
there are no enemy fighters in the air. Here the pilots' tasks 
are very limited: not to destroy, but to hold in place, restrict 
maneuver or simply unmask the adversary, suppress his air 
defense weapons for a short time in order to create favorable 
conditions for subsequent air or missile strikes. But in all 
situations the pilots must maintain constant readiness to fight 
air-to-air battles. 
  However in considering only passing strikes on ground 
targets, do we not understand the question too narrowly? After 
all, modern fighters are also capable of independent actions 
against enemy airfields. They can participate in air support of 
troops, supplementing the strikes of fighter-bombers and combat 
helicopters. 
  After this short recollection of present-day conditions of 
action of fighters against ground targets, let us look at the 
commander who makes the decision for precisely such an 
independent strike. Here there is food for thought. Clearly the 
commander, upon clarifying the received mission, will consider 
the required deadlines for its accomplishment, assess the target 
characteristics, their range, and the completeness of the 
information about them. He will also allow for the expected 
resistance of enemy air defenses, the capabilities of his 
aircraft, the level of proficiency of the flight personnel, and 
of course the terrain relief, the presence of characteristic 
reference points, and weather. 
  In the search for an optimal decision to strike, the 
commander is confronted by the following crucial questions: how 
to rationally distribute the fighter forces among the assigned 
or chosen targets and available time, what battle formation to 
take, how to attack the targets? Let us try to answer these 
questions with the commander. However, we must stipulate that 
without knowing the conclusions that the commander made in 
clarifying the mission and evaluating the specific situation, 
the answers might not be unequivocal. 
  How should fighter forces be distributed to accomplish the 
mission? We shall propose three different variants to the 
commander. He can for example mass the efforts by delivering a 
simultaneous strike against a preset target at a specific time. 
If the situation demands long-term action against the same 
target, or not so many fighter forces, the commander clearly 
will find it more expedient to operate with individual flights 
and pairs. In a complex and unclear situation, he will most 
likely decide to perform the mission by operating with limited 
fighter forces. 
  It goes without saying that there may also be other 
variants. 
In accordance with them, the commander distributes fighters 
among tactical groups, i.e., shifts to solution of the second 
crucial question -- determination of the battle formation. The 
commander must consider the different variants for its 
structure. If the strike objective is protected by a strong air 
defense, and there are enemy fighters patrolling in the air, if 
it is difficult to seek out and identify the target in the 
terrain, it will be necessary to create the tactical troops 
shown in figure 21. But analyze this distribution of forces: the 
combat strength of the supporting groups is 1.5 times greater 
than that of the strike force! Is such a ratio advisable? Here 
is why the commanders strive to combine the functions of the 
groups to the extent possible. For example, the group for 
suppression of the air defense weapons may be given the 
functions of followup reconnaissance of the target, and the 
group providing cover against enemy fighter attacks may change 
places with the strike force after it delivers its strike, as 
was the case in the cited example. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-19A>      Figure 21. Battle formation of fighters operating against a ground target. Group tactical </FIG>


  And the third crucial question: how to attack the target? 
Attack on the move from extremely low altitude--1; or first 
execute a vertical maneuver--2 (fig. 22)? In using the first 
tactical technique, the pilots may simply not have time to 
detect the target and aim at high speed, and the attack will be 
unsuccessful. The second tactical technique reduces the surprise 
of the attack -- the time spent by the pilots in executing the 
maneuver is adequate for the enemy to fire on them with SAMs. 
How can this contradiction be resolved? 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-20A>      Figure 22. Fighter attack of ground target. </FIG>


  Just as in the answers to previous questions, one should not 
expect ready-made recommendations. Rote prescriptions will not 
work for all tactical situations. One must be able to make 
independent and able decisions. 
  Here is one possible variant: if a flight delivers a strike 
on a ground target, and the first pair cannot attack on the move 
after the target is detected, it radios the target indication to 
the second pair, and itself executes a vertical maneuver and 
subsequent attack from a dive, as shown in Figure 22. The second 
pair makes the necessary turn to target and attacks it on the 
move, simultaneously suppressing the air defense weapons. A 
different situation may also develop: the first pair after 
detection of the target is capable of attacking it from the 
move. Then the second pair can either execute a vertical 
maneuver in order to better see the target, or also attack from 
the move. Everything is determined by the specific features of 
the target disposition, the enemy air defense weapons, and the 
level of your proficiency. 
  What follows from our discussions? Actions against ground 
targets is a combat mission of fighter aviation demanding 
different modes of combat action, battle formations, tactical 
techniques, and consequently also thorough training of the 
fighter pilots for its accomplishment, in combination of 
training in air-to-air combat, which occupies the main place in 
the activity of fighter pilots. Thus for example the leaders of 
the U.S. Air Force plan additional theoretical and flight 
training for fighters to deliver strikes against ground targets. 
Each pilot of an F-15 fighter makes 18 flights every six months 
to practice the skills of fire on ground targets and, after the 
fire, provision is made for the conduct of air-to-air battles. 
(AVIATION WEEK, 1984, No. 12). 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  Much has changed in the tactics of fighter aviation since 
the 
end of the Great Patriotic War, but all of its basic combat 
missions have remained unchanged, have become classical, and 
received further development. New ones have also appeared, for 
example, destruction of airborne assaults, disruption of aerial 
transports of the enemy, the battle with targets which 
previously did not exist (early warning and detection aircraft, 
reconnaissance-strike complexes, etc.) The tactics of fighter 
aviation in accomplishment of these tasks have their own 
specific features. 
  The development of fighter aviation tactics in 
accomplishment 
of combat missions occurs simultaneously with the improvement of 
aviation equipment. This shall be discussed further. 
<H5>  Chapter II. The Labyrinthine Links of Tactics and Technology </H5>
  The development of tactics and technology occurs in a 
dialectical unit and interrelationship. A qualitative leap in 
technology calls to life new tactical techniques, and the 
development of technology in turn engenders new types of 
weapons. An experienced reader on reading these lines will 
shrug: who is not familiar with this well-known theoretical 
precept? This is so, but let us level deeper into the 
labyrinthine links, and we will find many facts there which, 
alas, contradict this precept. 
<H5>  1. "Tactics Must Because Technology Can't"; "Technology Can </H5>
So Tactics Don't Have To" 
<H5>  Missiles or Cannon? </H5>
  In the vivid blue sky, an air-to-air battle is under way, 
one 
can see the flash of silver wings, hear the booming thump of the 
airborne cannons. First-generation jets, possessing only cannon 
for now, are fighting. But the spatial dimensions of the battle 
region of the new aircraft are no long the same (after all, 
their speed is 350-400 km/hr faster than that of piston planes), 
and the old weapons do not allow them to deliver fire from long 
range. Therefore the air warriors, as during the Great Patriotic 
War, still strive to close with one another to a range of 
200-300 meters. As a result of intensive maneuvering in the air, 
the same familiar "carousel" arose, but no irresistible attacks 
resulted. 
  Tactics dictated its demands to technology, and this led to 
the advent of air-to-air guided missiles. Of course the first 
missiles were not sufficiently reliable in battle, but they had 
a very valuable quality, the capacity to hit the adversary at 
long range. So how did events develop further? 
  Guided missiles became the basic type of fighter weapon. The 
arena of the air-to-air battle immediately expanded. The 
adversary had only to enter any point in the possible missile 
launch region at target engagement range unattainable by cannon, 
and he was close to victory, even with the launch of a single 
missile. And then the years-long monopoly of the cannon, which 
knew no rivals, was destroyed, and with it collapsed all the 
tactics of fighters based on cannon fire. Missiles fully 
supplanted the cannon, which had been removed from the armament 
by the end of the 50s. Fighters became "pure" missile platforms. 
  However, soon there was cause to regret this bitterly. It 
turned out that missiles developed to engage targets from long 
range, and possessing restrictions in minimal range and launch 
aspect, G forces and altitude of utilization, could not replace 
cannon in close combat. With the start of maneuver, missiles 
would pass by. For example, in the first year of the Vietnam 
War, of every 11 Sidewinder missiles fired by American fighters, 
only one hit the target. (INTERAVIA. 1974, No. 12). After 
unsuccessful missile launch, pilots closed with the targets, but 
had nothing to engage them with, and the number of missiles on 
board did not exceed two to four. And there were failures, still 
not understood, which, despite the desperate attempts of the 
pilots to execute the missile launch, led to break-off of the 
attack. The unreliability of the weapons took away their 
confidence in battle, a necessary condition for victory. Later 
on, the influence of electronic jamming on the missiles added to 
these shortcomings. 
  Thus it was found that missiles are far from being the ideal 
weapon, especially to engage a maneuvering adversary at close 
range. After expenditure of a limited number of missiles, the 
fighter became virtually unarmed. But even cannon did not have 
high effectiveness. No dialectical unit in the development of 
technology and tactics was achieved. A paradox arose in the 
labyrinthine interrelationship, which could be formulated as: 
"Tactics have to -- technology can't." 
  What was to be done? It was necessary to again mount those 
same cannon on fighters. Despite their inherent short range and 
narrow sector of fire, they again demonstrated greater 
simplicity of design and reliability than missiles, had no 
limitations of minimal firing range, and in addition were slow 
to become outmoded. To this day modern fighters have cannon, and 
evidently they will stay on prospective aircraft. 
  However, the second birth of cannon did not lead to a 
reduction in the role of missiles. Today fighters can launch 
them from long and short range, at any aspects. The missiles 
have significantly larger launch zones, high maneuver and 
energy-ballistic characteristics, and this allows the pilots to 
destroy air targets flying several kilometers higher than the 
fighters. There are short-range missiles to engage visible 
targets, allowing surprise attack from the most diverse 
positions. The jamming resistance of the missiles is growing 
constantly. 
  But then what is the point of the cannon? It is this: like 
any other weapons system, missiles have their own restrictions 
and their joint use with cannon allows the fighters to attack 
the adversary under conditions when missiles are not effective 
enough. One can even avoid all-aspect missiles if the 
appropriate maneuver is made ahead of time, and not only avoid, 
but in the process enter the field of fire of one's own cannon. 
Cannon also remain invulnerable to electronic jamming. 
  Improvement of missiles forces the designers to search for 
ways also to improve the cannon of fighters. How many models of 
aircraft cannon have been devised by engineering thought! 
Multi-barrel and single-barrel ones of the revolver type, 
20-millimeter and higher caliber cannon. Tactics demand 
increased fire density, and the rate of fire of the guns grows, 
require that the range of fire be increased, and the initial 
velocity of the rounds is increased, require that the accuracy 
be improved, and rounds are designed which are guided in their 
trajectory, with proximity fuzes, new sighting and computing 
devices are devised, a system for display on the front of the 
cockpit canopy, systems using holographic lenses and liquid 
crystals -- all this in order to meet the demands of tactics. 
  As we see, ultimately the paradox of "tactics have to, 
technology can't" has exhausted itself. However in the 
labyrinthine interrelations one can also observe the opposite 
paradoxes, "technology can, tactics don't have to." 
<H5>  These Insidious Properties of Speed </H5>
  The beginning of the jet era was marked by a great leap in 
speed of aircraft, which immediately increased by 350-400 km/hr 
in comparison with the speed of piston aircraft. Limited 
capabilities of pilots to search for and destroy targets at such 
speeds were compensated for by weapons radars and guided 
missiles. The framework of battle covered the range of 
supersonic speeds and penetrated the stratosphere. Command posts 
with ground radars were included in command and control. An 
unprecedented takeoff of design thinking, brilliant solution of 
seemingly impossible problems in the tactics of fighter 
aviation! Using the great flight speed, fighters could more 
quickly assume a favorable position for battle and announce 
their appearance with a crushing missile strike from long range 
before the adversary could make a defensive maneuver or even see 
the attackers. 
  By the end of the 50s, in the views of many military 
theorists the logic of the air-to-air battle appeared as 
follows: guidance of the fighter from the ground, closing with 
the target in a straight trajectory, single lightning attack and 
launch of missiles in flight at high speed in a straight line. 
In order to vanquish the adversary, it was necessary to see him 
first and have time to launch the missiles. Therefore the 
success of battle was determined basically by the competition of 
the sides in the range of detection of ground and airborne 
radars. The close maneuver battle in the classical scheme of 
intercept was not envisaged; what is more it was recommended to 
the pilots that they avoid guns, since they lead to rapid loss 
of speed. 
  To please the then-common concepts and demands of tactics on 
technology, aviation designers of the leading countries of the 
world were absorbed by the problem of achieving great speeds in 
their development of prospective fighters. While fighters by the 
start of the 50s had a speed corresponding to M = 0.8-0.9, in 
the 60s it had already reached M = 2.2 and more. The triumphant 
growth of speed was not halted either by technical difficulties 
or by significant economic expenditures, but one other problem 
was noted here, which had the most serious consequences: such 
great speeds could not be used by the fighters in air-to-air 
battles. 
  Here was cause for surprise: why had all fighters during the 
Second World War resorted to maximum speed quite often, and 
their descendants could not realize these speeds? The answer to 
this question demanded serious examination of objective 
processes of technologic development. If military theorists 
could somehow predict the vicissitudes of air-to-air battle at 
subsonic speeds, the absurdity of the arising situation put them 
at an impasse. Yet another paradox? The fact was that high 
supersonic speeds narrowed the field of possible attacks and 
ruled out maneuvering at short distances. Indeed, the flight 
itself of the fighter to interception, which was almost 
programmed, presupposed straight-line movement of the air 
target, and was not marked by great diversity of variants. 
Arrival at the point of detection of the target was based on 
standard, already practiced maneuvers. But it is much easier to 
deceive a pre-entered program after it has been used several 
times. 
  Reality confirmed this. Air-to-air battles of fighters in 
local wars usually included not one but several attacks and 
maneuvers between attacks. In these battles, speed in itself 
meant little. It had importance only jointly with the 
established G force, i.e., the capacity to maneuver. The pilots 
sought as quickly as possible to turn and reach the area of 
possible attacks, but the radiuses and time of the turns of the 
fighters had increased so much that they went beyond the limits 
of visual contact with the adversary and could not continue the 
battle. Therefore, they had to deliberately operate only in a 
range of subsonic speeds. 
  And now we again must ask ourselves: where here is the 
dialectical unity in the development of tactics and technology? 
Something unacceptable had occurred -- "technology can, tactics 
don't have to." Speed or maneuverability? Which characteristics 
should be preferred, if they are difficult to separate from one 
another, if they are directly related and mutually caused? 
  In the search for acceptable answers to these questions, 
military specialists largely reached the conclusion that to 
conduct air-to- air-battles fighters were needed with flight 
characteristics ensuring high angular velocities and 
accelerations, minimal turning radiuses, and good 
controllability in a broad range of altitudes. But the maximum 
speed, in their opinion, must correspond to M = 2-2.5. (FLUG 
REVUE, 1970, VII.) The way out of this paradox was not long in 
coming. The tendency of continuous growth in speed continued 
until the end of the 60s. In the last twenty years, however, the 
speed of fighters has not vitally increased, but has not 
diminished either. This tendency toward restriction of speed is 
surprisingly stable. 
  It turns out that the well-known motto of aviation, "fly 
higher, further, and faster" requires clarification for 
fighters. It is not always necessary to fly fastest. Of course, 
we cannot discard the former motto, but a supplement to it 
suggests itself: fly fastest only before the start of battle. 
The precept has not changed even today. Pilots of the F-15 
fighter argue that upon detection of targets even at long range 
(75 km) and in flight at maximum speed they do not have time to 
lock on, track, and air, resulting in breakoff of the attacks. 
<H5>  Single-Purpose or Multi-Purpose Fighter? </H5>
  The high performance requirements on aircraft and their 
armament, formulated in resolution of the first two paradoxes, 
led to a third, confronting military scientists and designers 
with a dilemma: single-purpose or multi-purpose fighter? 
  Initially a characteristic feature in aircraft construction 
was the development of single-purpose fighters, specially 
adapted for the conduct of air-to-air combat (in the foreign 
press they were called air superiority fighters). The basic 
demands on them: great thrust-to-weight ratio 
[tyagovooruzhennost], exceeding flight weight; low specific load 
on the wing; high strength of construction, intended for high G 
forces; good acceleration characteristics and climb; sight and 
weapons for long-range and close combat, making it possible to 
detect and attack targets flying higher, lower, and to the side 
against a background of clutter. (AVIATION AND MARINE. 1976, No. 
29). 
  Colossal sums were spent to develop single-purpose aircraft, 
many years were required, and such fighters (F-15 and F-16) were 
constructed in the U.S. in the early 70s. Subsequently they 
assigned them two equivalent tasks, so that they be used for 
actions against ground targets, and called them multi-purpose 
aircraft. However it was soon found that in contrast to former 
generations such expensive aircraft were little suited for this. 
  The paradoxical nature of the prevailing situation lay in 
the 
fact that the narrowly specialized fighters were deprived of the 
capability, as had been the case in past wars, of quickly 
shifting from one mission to the other, building up efforts of 
strike aviation in support of troops, or flexible use in 
critical situations of the combined-arms battle. Nor were 
economic assessments the least consideration. (The 
single-purpose F-15C fighter costs 30 million dollars, and the 
multi-purpose F-15E 2.5 million dollars more (INTERAVIA AIR 
LETTER, 1986, 22 December). For this reason, in the countries of 
Western Europe, which did not have adequate funds for 
construction of specialized fighters, only multi-purpose 
fighters were developed, intended for the accomplishment of both 
tasks. 
  In this regard, a struggle of two contradictory tendencies 
began in airplane construction. One of them continued to be 
directed toward development of fighters for air-to-air combat, 
and the other toward development of multi-purpose fighters 
having the qualities of the fighter, the bomber, and the 
ground-attack plane. The opinions of specialists were divided. 
Some showed lively interest in multi-purpose aircraft, others 
spoke ironically about the unrestrained fantasy of the latter. 
  Say the "pure fighter" proponents, Sure you can also fight 
with multi-purpose planes, but combining in one plane such 
contradictory characteristics as increased maneuverability and 
the capacity to carry a good payload, to accommodate complex and 
bulky equipment, inevitably leads to an increase in flight 
weight of the aircraft. For example, that same single-purpose 
F-15 fighter, after refitting to a multi-purpose aircraft, 
weighed 34 tonnes instead of 20, and the F-16 fighter 22 tonnes 
instead of 16. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1983, No. 2.) Can 
this promote energetic maneuvers in air-to-air combat? And 
strikes against ground targets? After all, in the Vietnam War 
pilots of the multi-purpose F-4 Phantom, without adequate 
professional training, suffered much greater losses than fighter 
bombers. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1972, No. 8.) 
  Proponents of multi-purpose planes are charmed by the 
universality of their use (the plane remains the same, but is 
augmented with onboard equipment, arms, and programs entered in 
the moment of the onboard computer), and also the 
standardization of the technical maintenance and repair. And if 
universal machines are not possible, then at least air-to-air 
fighters must constitute a good basis for modification of them 
into multi-purpose aircraft. 
  Different opinions, different approaches. Time will tell 
which of the tendencies will be more developed, but for now we 
are interested in the causes of the paradoxes, arising in the 
labyrinthine relations of tactics and technology. 
<H5>  The Burial Ground of Projects </H5>
  It would of course be foolish to assume the relations of 
tactics and technology consist only of paradoxes and 
contradictions, but nonetheless... Technology provides fighters 
with missiles, and the fighters demand their former cannon; 
technology offers greater speed, and fighters abandon the 
concept of a one-time missile attack, and halt before the choice 
of single-purpose or multi-purpose aircraft. In this labyrinth 
there is always something unpredictable, you never really know 
what will happen tomorrow. From this aspect it seems to almost 
be a riddle. And at the same time, vivid unusual findings which 
are fated to move tactics forward! 
  The history of aviation also knows many other examples, when 
the implementation of tempting, at first glance, projects ended 
in failure. What projects have specialists not developed, what 
predictions have they not made! It cannot be the case that they 
did not know what they were about. On the basis of statistical 
data by means of modelling, extrapolation, expert evaluation, 
the state of the aircraft inventory was predicted decades in 
advance, new types of air weapons were determined. Did it all go 
right? By the logic of the designers, they were supposed to 
achieve colossal successes. However let us return to projects of 
10-15 years ago and what do we see? The time for adoption of new 
models had come or was drawing near, but certain of them were 
never developed. Here are a few examples of unfulfilled projects. 
  At the start of the 70s development was halted on seemingly 
promising types of weapons for strategic bombers: Skybolt 
ballistic missiles, defensive BDM missiles, and also "Scud" 
decoys which were widely proclaimed in the press. Somewhat later 
the same fate befell remote-controlled aircraft for various 
purposes, and certain models of reconnaissance strike complexes 
(SOTAS). 
  All these models remained just projects, although they had 
been thought up, calculated, drawn on paper, and many even 
incorporated in metal. However, although the engineers 
participating in realization of these projects showed great 
stubbornness, opposing the failures with their technical 
inventiveness, they never reached serial production. The new 
models died without being born. This at-first-glance illogical 
phrase in fact very precisely reflects the logic of development 
of one of the interacting sides. Can one be surprised? When 
tactics are silent, technology creates new paradoxes. 
  But not only the designers erred. It would be wrong to 
assume 
that such paradoxes were not made by military theorists in the 
field of tactics. One need only recall their serious 
miscalculations in determining the role of fighter aviation with 
the advent of SAMs and nuclear weapons, or the denial of 
maneuver multiple-aircraft battles already mentioned above. 
  A 25-year-old prediction is recalled with irony. "There can 
be no question of air-to-air battles in the far future," the 
NATO journal REVUE MILITAIRE GENERALE announced categorically. 
"Essentially the concept of air-to-air combat, which was a 
necessary component of the early period of war, has already 
become outmoded. We must repeat that the tactics of air-to-air 
combat should be consigned to the archives." (REVUE MILITAIRE 
GENERALE, 1964, February). 
  Some concepts put forward in the West shifted battle to the 
stratosphere, it never reached there, but remained in the range 
of high and low altitudes. 
  This sad catalogue of paradoxes and other most silly 
proposals in the field of tactics is annoying and boring. It is 
easy to judge events and persons from such a long distance, when 
we look at the tactics and technology of long-ago years, but at 
the same time it is not easy, if we do not note the causal 
relationships of the phenomena. Alas they are not immediately 
evident. To us, the errors in assessments, the limitation of 
tactical thinking and engineering thought in understanding the 
relations of tactics and technology are evident, at times 
incomprehensible, and even laughable. But while possessing some 
historical experience, strangely we at times repeat these same 
errors and must speak ironically of ourselves. 
  Conflict situations, as a result of which joint or 
uncoordinated efforts of tactics and technology do not achieve 
the desired goals, and enormous resources are squandered, gave 
cause for humorists to call the field of relations of tactics 
and technology the "burial ground of projects and concepts." 
Unfortunately, this sarcastic quip is not far from the truth and 
sometimes appears as if a cruel fate pursues tacticians and 
engineers, but it is not a matter of mysticism. Only one need 
not take the easy path, that of endless rebukes of engineers and 
tacticians: they didn't allow for this and didn't uncover that. 
  However there is a point to asking questions: whence these 
unpredictable turns in the development of tactics and 
technology, how can one find reasonable explanations to such 
puzzling metamorphoses in technical projects and tactical 
concepts? And finally, what is the way out of this impasse? Let 
us try to look closely at this bundle of contradictions, and 
then we might find some quite unexpected answers. 
<H5>  2. The Search For a Way Out </H5>
<H5>  An Equation With Many Unknowns </H5>
  In pondering the relations of technology and tactics, and 
the 
unsuccessful projects, one willy nilly begins thinking about the 
mistakes that were made. There are many grounds for believing 
that they testify not to laziness of intellect, incompetence of 
tacticians and engineers, or their ignorance of research being 
done, and developments in the given fields, but rather 
inadequate allowance for form conditions. In some cases they did 
not pay heed to practical requirements of a tactical or 
engineering idea, the justification for large economic 
expenditures, some unfavorable factors, and, in others, they 
raised the importance of secondary factors, or those which did 
not receive further development. These circumstances are very 
reminiscent of an equation with many unknowns. One can say with 
confidence only that not one of its members (factors) should be 
equal to zero. 
  How to resolve this equation, or in other words, how serious 
are such circumstances? The fact is that with acceleration of 
scientific-technical progress and the development of new 
technologies, when the opportunity has arisen to create planes 
and weapons at accelerated rates, less time remains for the 
influence of technology on tactics. In addition, more vital and 
vivid changes in combat properties of new models of technology 
hinder consideration and allowance for all influencing factors. 
The advent of guided missiles and radar weapons sights 
influenced tactics incomparably more than the replacement of 
aircraft machineguns with cannon. 
  The equation with many unknowns remains even today. 
Therefore 
one cannot rule out the possibility of unexpected 
scientific-technical breakthroughs and surprise leaps in 
development of technology, even in related fields, which might 
be used in the interests of tactics. What is more, such an 
unprogrammed innovation, coming into the world, often reveals 
tactical properties which not even its creators foresaw. Of 
course it at once consigns to second place the models which 
existed previously. Such situations are a great rarity, and they 
cannot immediately lead to radical changes in tactics. 
  For example, was it possible to program with adequate 
precision the expected changes in tactics on the eve of creation 
of guided missiles and weapons radars? Is it possible today to 
anticipate such changes in the event, say, of the appearance of 
laser or some other weapons of fighters with fundamentally new, 
still unknown properties, which will immediately lead to the 
outmoding of present missiles and sights? Would the tactics of 
battle of jet aircraft not undergo immediate vital changes. Thus 
the jokers again will have cause to make fun of the utterance 
"technology can, tactics don't have to." 
  Here there is yet another quite weighty circumstance: the 
number of technical alternatives for satisfaction of the 
identical demands of tactics is growing swiftly. Look, reader, 
at a far from complete list of these alternatives (Table 1). How 
can we balance and ensure a rational combination of them, 
without resorting to the experience of the tailor mending 
Grisha's caftan. I will not bother you with superfluous 
explanations, and offer them for your own comparison and 
analysis.

                                        of fueling and charging the aircraft 


  You of course will allow for the contradictory nature of 
tactical requirements (high speed and maneuverability, 
maneuverability and low wing load, etc.), will assess the 
tendency of growth of the most characteristic indices, e.g., 
energy-to-weight ratio (0.4 in the first postwar fighters, 0.7 
to 0.8 in fighters of the 50s, 1.2 in modern ones). Do not 
forget to compare also the comparative importance of tactical 
requirements. For example the range and duration of flight. 
Behind these demands is the capability of intercepting the 
adversary at remote lines, long air patrol time, basing at 
airfields far from the front line, broad maneuver along the 
front and in depth. 
  It goes without saying that the variety of technical 
alternatives does not decide the fate of present or planed 
developments, but it is directly related to them. This may lead 
to unforeseen leaps in the development of technology, and may, 
on the contrary, separate the efforts of designers and engineers 
with incomplete allowance for all influencing factors. After 
all, not every alternative variant can be immediately 
implemented, but that which today is not feasible, i.e., does 
not have the necessary conditions for realization, will tomorrow 
become a real possibility. 
  And now, let us examine these questions from the standpoint 
of tactics. Its needs at times exceed the capabilities of 
technology. Although the changes themselves in it are a response 
to some urgent problems of tactics, the lag of technology behind 
the demands of tactics, as testified to by numerous examples, is 
a quite frequent phenomenon in the history of fighter aviation. 
One cannot discount also the subjective factors: the dictate of 
engineering thought contrary to tactical considerations, and the 
development of tactical demands without allowance for their 
technical realization. If this occurs, the lack of understanding 
between tacticians and engineers most often acquires a conflict 
nature. 
  This is the logical chain which is established on the path 
of 
emergency from the labyrinth of relations and in the search for 
right solutions. With the sharp acceleration in the number of 
models of new weapons produced per unit of time, just as the 
speedup of advances in tactics, these relations become 
increasingly more complex and elusive. They are not always 
stable and have numerous manifestations. Precisely in the 
exceptional breadth and multifaceted nature of the relations of 
tactics and technology, in their incomplete comprehension, in 
the "volitional" voluntaristic solutions, when the development 
of new tactical techniques and modes of weapons is conducted 
without allowance for mutual capacities, finally in the absence 
of a uniform criterion, one finds the causes of many paradoxes. 
This is the essence of the equation with many unknowns. 
  Where then is the way out? Only in a profound understanding 
of the dialectics of development of tactics and technology, in 
an even more profound allowance for their relations. 
<H5>  The Fields of Cooperation of Tactics and Technology </H5>
  The reader has noted of course that he is again being nudged 
toward a truism: under the influence of tactics, the technical 
aspect of fighters is formed, their characteristics are 
optimized, while the improvement of technology leads to changes 
in the nature of battle. In tracing these relations, we have 
seen that despite the contradictions, in response to every 
critical situation (paradox), even if not at once, the pilots 
had at their disposal both technical innovations and new 
tactical techniques. Only this dialectic does not always yield 
to the logic of scientific thinking. The aspiration of military 
scientists and designers to penetrate the labyrinths of 
relations of tactics and technology, as before, collides with a 
whole group of contradictory and complex factors. Therefore, in 
order that the "wonders of technology" planned for development 
not turn out to be ultimately merely clever fabrications of 
designers, one can say that the basis of design of new 
technology and development of tactics should be long-term 
forecasting and a systems approach. 
  What is a systems approach, what an integrated approach? The 
total system of relations may be represented as the totality of 
a number of functioning elements, as a strictly coordinated 
group, including subsystems of the aircraft, weapons of one's 
own and those of the enemy, the tactics of the opposing sides, 
the means of supporting their combat actions, and more 
fragmented components. 
  But we will not hold to strict scientific formulations. If 
you, the reader, in delving into some technical engineering 
problem, simultaneously weigh both of its aspects, allow for the 
countering action of the probable adversary, assess and 
coordinate the different combinations of characteristics of 
speed, maneuverability, level of signature and survivability 
with the weapons and support equipment, estimate the technical 
risk of development, carefully formulate its goals, beforehand 
"play out" the variants of their attainment, in short 
comprehensively trace all relations in accordance with a uniform 
program, and on the basis of uniform initial ideas, consider 
that you are using a systems approach. 
  This is not easy to do. But if the reader keeps the desire 
to 
have his say in tactics, and receive responses regarding the way 
of their further development, he must search for them in each 
element of the system and on the basis of interests of the 
system as a whole. To do this he needs to study all the fields 
and directions, in which military-technical and 
operational-tactical thought is operating today, and assess 
which of them promises the greatest success. Only then can one 
continue the noted tendencies tomorrow, and most importantly, 
allow for the alternative combinations in selection of the 
optimal variant from those shown in Table 1. 
  However, we must stipulate that this is practically feasible 
only for large collectives of tacticians and engineers, crossing 
traditional borders between the concepts of "tactics" and 
"technology." They are the ones who form the "tactical order" 
for technology, precise, clear, understandable, which might be 
accomplished. 
  The "tactical order," or demands on technology, forms 
literally all elements of tactics. Only after soberly and 
judiciously weighing our "subsystems," can one find and justify 
the inherent requirements. Otherwise one cannot emerge from the 
numerous impasses. 
  If we again analyze Table 1, it is not hard to imagine many 
fields of successful cooperation of tactics and technology 
satisfying its needs. Now there are becoming more and more of 
them. Without retelling and without assessing the ways of 
satisfying all demands of tactics shown in the table with 
technology, let us first turn to one, seemingly not the main 
one, of minimal volume, time, and high reliability of technical 
maintenance. But this requirement lays bare many other problems 
as well, which one must ponder. 
  Who needs plans with a high volume of technical maintenance, 
frequent failures and breakdowns, with high repair time? What 
would be the level of combat readiness of subunits and a unit if 
the preparation of aircraft for a sortie takes not minutes, but 
hours? 
  Note that the increasing complexity of aviation equipment, 
the difficulty in finding defects, errors in the computer 
software which is part of present-day equipment, and also the 
shortage of highly qualified specialists -- all this aggravates 
the problem. How should aircraft designers proceed in order to 
raise the reliability of operation of aviation equipment, reduce 
the duration of preparation for sorties, and repair of damaged 
aircraft? 
  Let's look at fourth-generation aircraft. They already 
include many improvements of those shown in Table 1. The MiG-29 
(Figure 23) [not reproduced], for example. Replacement of the 
engines in them takes just a few dozen minutes without removal 
of the fuselage, while before it took many hours. And the Su-27 
aircraft (Figure 24) [not reproduced], equipped with 
modular-design engines, consisting of individual units. If 
damage occurs, there is no need to replace the whole engine. It 
suffices to replace the faulty module. The reliability of 
operation of the equipment in flight has also grown. On those 
same Su-27s, the onboard systems operate with quadruple 
redundancy, and there is also a maximum mode limiter. 
  Reliability of operation of the equipment, the deadlines and 
cost of repair and overhaul of faulty aircraft to a significant 
degree are determined by the capabilities of the monitoring and 
testing systems. Using such systems, which record the readouts 
of numerous sensors located in the required places, one can 
automatically monitor the status of the onboard equipment 
(functional monitoring) and also automatically identify arising 
defects (functional diagnostics). For this the corresponding 
programs are entered in the computers of the systems. 
  Imagine, after landing you taxi to the parking area. The 
technician connects the mobile monitoring and testing station to 
the aircraft, and switches on the equipment. And checking the 
"health" of the plane, a tape is fed from the printer with 
signs, numbers, and pulses incomprehensible to the layman. 
Casting a penetrating glance at it, the technician (granted, 
under your supervision) reads the "diagnosis" and takes the 
necessary steps in accordance with it. 
  Provided there is high reliability of diagnostics, and 
consequently of the technical maintenance itself, it will become 
possible to reduce or do away with individual operations, 
conduct complete preflight preparation right after conclusion of 
the regular flight. All this crowds more into the time of 
operation of the aviation equipment, and thus increases the 
number of combat ready aircraft per hour, per day. But isn't 
this tantamount to increasing the fighter aviation forces with 
the same organic strength of fighters in the subunit and unit? 
And a reduction in the numerical strength of the 
engineer-technical personnel maintaining the aviation equipment, 
the strength of the repair organs, reduces the needs for tools, 
simplifying documentation? Such machines, so expensive to 
produce, are becoming more and more economical in operation, and 
make it possible to save many of the people's rubles. But this 
is still not all. Leaving the technicians on the ground with 
their infallible prognoses, you climb into the air to perform 
the combat mission. In the air-to-air battle you of course do 
not have time to systematically monitor the operation of the 
engine and equipment. Here you are assisted by the onboard 
monitoring and testing systems, which are based on 
self-diagnosis of their operation. They sensitively pick up how 
the engine is operating, how the temperature is holding, how 
fuel is being expended. If a sensor signals danger, be it 
failure, malfunction of some aggregate or other problem, the 
onboard computer, after sorting through many variants, picks the 
optimal one: redundant or reserve channels are switched on, 
ensuring accomplishment of the functions of the failed 
aggregate. Here the pilot is told what has been done on what and 
why. It seems improbable that the system itself makes the 
decision. This is how a seemingly secondary requirement of 
tactics is realized. (The time for technical maintenance of 
American F-15 fighters is one third less than for the F-4, and 
was reduced even more for the F-16. The leaders of the U.S. Air 
Force bluntly state their readiness to give up certain 
performance characteristics of the fighters if this makes it 
possible to reduce the volume and time and raise the reliability 
of maintenance and repair capacity.) (AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4) 
  In designing new planes, aircraft designers do not forget 
other tactical demands either. In accordance with them, the 
performance of fighters has been improved, the power of the 
weapons grows, and reliability of technical maintenance (Fig. 
25) is enhanced. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-27A>      Figure 25. Technology meets the demands of tactics. </FIG>


  Multifaceted and complex fields of cooperation of tactics 
and 
equipment have many different aspects. The adversary's 
electronic countermeasures are growing, prompting designers to 
develop interference resistant weapons sights, and receivers to 
warn of radar and IR radiation, automatic devices for ejecting 
dipole reflectors and decoy targets. This diverse assortment of 
EW means are quickly supplemented by built-in active jammers, 
apparatus to counter electro-optical and laser weapons of the 
adversary. 
  It is necessary to simplify the use of these numerous 
equipments by the pilot of a single-seater fighter aircraft. In 
response to this requirement of tactics, whole systems are being 
developed which are based on integration of separately operating 
onboard systems and automation of EW process. Here the designers 
provide for onboard energy resources to support operation of 
such systems, an expedient sequence of suppression of radars and 
types of jamming, and the commanders are given the right to 
clarify the control personnel of the EW assets before a sortie 
in accordance with the data of electronic reconnaissance and the 
assigned combat mission. 
  The need arises to control the battle from onboard the 
fighters, and in the cockpits of the group commanders tactical 
situation scopes have appeared (Figure 26) [not reproduced]. On 
the multicolor display, without turning his head the commander 
can see the location and heading of the aircraft, friendly and 
enemy, determine their speed and altitude from a marker, know 
which of the pilots of his group are engaging, and monitor their 
actions. 
  All the areas of successful cooperation of tactics and 
technology cannot be enumerated. The pilot-radar probably can 
recall many such examples. But we are interested in examining 
only those which are incorporated in the construction of 
new-generation fighters, those which are to be assimilated on 
the threshold of the 21st century. After all, the dialectics of 
interaction of technology and equipment are such that in the 
process of satisfying the demands of today, the demands of 
tomorrow will be born. 
<H5>  3. Fighters on the Threshold of the Twenty-First Century </H5>
  The change of fighter aircraft, piston, jet, supersonic, 
occurring in the second half of our century, is approaching its 
next turn. What will the generation of fighters be like which is 
about to replace the current generation? How are their 
appearance, armament, and equipment envisioned? These questions, 
on the eve of the year 2000, concern both the air veteran and 
the new pilot. Take a look at the sketches of such fighters 
(Figure 27) [not reproduced]. For the present they arouse only 
our delight, do they not? Sharp-nosed, sharp-winged, and swift! 
Let us take a closer look at this unknown that attracts us. 
  According to the performance requirements, developed by 
military specialists abroad, the new-generation fighters must be 
fast and maneuverable, have a low level of give-away signs, and 
equipment to destroy a large number of targets simultaneously. 
(AIR FORCE, 1988. No. 1) 
  Let us begin with speed. In contrast to present-day 
fighters, 
the new ones should have supersonic cruising speed in 
non-afterburning operating modes. This quality is necessary for 
more economical fuel expenditure, making it possible to expand 
the region of effective coverage of installations against air 
strikes and sharply raising the capabilities of the fighters in 
terms of rapid intercept of aerial targets at remote lines 
(Figure 28). (INTERAVIA, 1985. No. 6). From the figure it is 
clear that the possible lines of intercept for fighters with 
supersonic cruising speed may be extended by a factor of two or 
more, all other conditions being equal, in comparison with the 
American F-15 fighters without it (the fighters will head for 
the interception from alert status at an airfield five and two 
minutes after detection of the target, which is moving at a 
speed corresponding to M = 1.5 at a height of 1,500 meters). 
(INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.) In addition, during 
flight at such speed, the duration of pursuit of targets is 
significantly reduced, and the threat of engagement of fighters 
by ground AD weapons of the adversary is diminished. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-28A>      Figure 28. Possible lines of interception of aerial targets. </FIG>


  At the same time, design thinking continues to search for 
new 
engineering solutions to expand the maneuver characteristics and 
the field of combat application of fighters in a great range of 
altitudes and speeds, including at low sub-sonic speeds. Success 
can be achieved here, in addition to all else, through control 
of the thrust vector of the engine using swiveling nozzles (for 
vertical displacement of the aircraft, the nozzles are tilted 
downward, and in horizontal flight backward) and the use of 
systems to control aerodynamic forces (Figure 29, position 1). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-29A>      Figure 29. Possible expansion of the field of combat application of fighters. </FIG>

  The last point requires explanation. The fact is that 
systems 
based on direct control of lift and lateral forces allow the 
pilots to change the attitude of the aircraft without changing 
the flight trajectory, or vice versa, changing the trajectory 
while retaining the position of one or several axes (flat turns 
without roll, vertical displacements without a change in the 
angle of pitch). Such fundamentally new maneuvers may be 
performed using an automated system or manually. This system 
also allows good controllability in flight modes close to 
critical. 
  In addition, the field of new application of fighters with 
respect to altitude and speed may be expanded through further 
increase in the power of the engines and improvement in the 
aerodynamic qualities of the airframe (Figure 29, position 2). 
The altitude and speed characteristics of the American F-16 
fighter are shown by way of comparison. 
  A most important characteristic feature in the development 
of 
new- generation fighters will be the reduction in their 
tell-tale signs. This is not a new feature, to be sure. The 
attempt has always been made to make fighters hard to detect by 
the adversary. However in the past the campaign against 
tell-tale signs was conducted only in some directions (masking 
camouflage paint, radio silence) and never waged along the 
entire front. But these trends were only half-measures; the 
tell-tale signs remained. However no design solutions, even in 
the form of controversial hypotheses, laying the formation for 
further research, were considered for some time. As always in 
such cases, many dilettantish, unsound arguments, about 
noiseless aircraft, optically transparent, etc., arose. This was 
like the idea of conversion of a beam of light into electrical 
energy. Theoretically possible, but in practice... 
  Only the level of scientific and technical progress and 
technology of the 70s made it possible to begin combatting 
tell-tale signs of fighters in different ranges of the 
electromagnetic spectrum, but the task proved to be more complex. 
  There are many directions in which work is under way. 
Perhaps 
the most important today is the reduction in radar cross section 
of the fighters, in order to hamper their detection by radar 
assets, for it is radar which at present has the best 
characteristics in comparison with other means, and comprises 
the basis of the air defense system. 
  In order to reduce the radar cross section, aerodynamic 
shapes and configurations of aircraft are being improved -- 
everything to avoid right angles and reduce the area of plane 
surfaces or replace them with a large number of flat edges, 
which reflect the radio waves away from the direction of the 
operating radar. In place of the traditional metallic materials, 
the aircraft designs more and more use radio-absorbing composite 
materials and coatings which scatter the electromagnetic energy 
of the radar signals. 
  The second area of importance is suppression of thermal 
radiation of fighters, chiefly from the propulsion systems. 
Besides the radar range of electromagnetic waves, the IR range 
is the only one in which aircraft may be detected beyond visual 
limits. This is an even more difficult technical problem, 
because no fighter can do without a powerful, afterburning 
engine. In order to reduce the intensity of thermal radiation, 
heat-absorbing and insulating materials are used, the most 
heated parts of the engine are screened, their nozzles are 
cooled, and various materials are injected into the stream of 
exhaust gases to reduce the temperature of the gases or change 
the radiation spectrum. 
  It is still unclear which of these directions will gain the 
highest priority in the future, but most likely they will 
develop in tandem, with a revision of the already traditional 
priorities depending on the development of means of detection of 
the opposing side. 
  The development of new models of arms and onboard apparatus, 
which must not give away the fighters, also has its own 
directions. It will be necessary to abandon external suspension 
of many types of weapons, and mount them flush with the surface 
of the aircraft in specially made recesses in the skin, do away 
with suspended containers in favor of apparatus built into the 
fuselage, and reduce the number of projecting antennas. All 
specialists stress as one that if powerful radars remain on the 
aircraft, which are incapable of operating in the short-term 
radiation mode, and there are no other non-radiating means of 
detection of air targets (IR sights, electronic reconnaissance 
equipment, laser equipment), if outside fuel tanks and suspended 
missiles are retained, then all the striving of the pilots to 
achieve surprise in battle will be in vain, and they will be a 
lucrative target for missiles guided to the operating radars. 
More strict demands are also imposed on the dimensions of the 
radar antennas, which may increase the radar cross section of 
the aircraft. As a result of all these improvements, the 
designers hope to develop a fighter whose radar cross section 
does not exceed 0.1 meters squared. 
  In addition, in the interests of a close air-to-air battle, 
it is still considered necessary for fighters of the new 
generation to have a comfortable cockpit, which does not 
restrict the view or pilot capabilities of constant visual 
contact with aircraft of the opposing side. Foreign military 
specialists, arguing the importance of this requirement, cite 
statistical data according to which 80 percent of all losses of 
fighters in combat actions since the Second World War have been 
related to inadequate pilot knowledge of the surrounding air 
situation.(FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4118.) 
  In the field of armament, despite the existing differences 
in 
designs and their determining concepts, the tendency of 
equipment fighter aircraft with all-aspect long- and 
intermediate-range missiles, and also short-range missiles and 
cannon, has been rather precisely determined. Powerful weapons 
are being developed, allowing engagement of air targets at 
various ranges, from many tens of kilometers to tens of meters, 
and at any aspect. 
  Autonomy of action after launch, i.e., guidance to target 
without constant tracking by the onboard radar, is considered a 
necessary property of future missiles. The fact is that the need 
to hold the target in radar lock-on during launch of missiles 
with radar semi-active guidance "ties" the pilot to a single 
enemy plane for a rather long time (by the yardstick of an 
air-to-air battle). According to data in the foreign press, this 
time can reach 20-25 or 10-20 seconds, depending on whether the 
target is inside or outside of visual range (for the Sparrow 
medium-range missile). In this time another enemy aircraft can 
suddenly attack the fighters. For example, the American AMRAAM 
missiles have this property -- they are equipped with active 
radar homing heads and a guidance system in the middle phase of 
the flight trajectory. Having autonomous missiles, pilots are 
able to begin any maneuver immediately after their launch. This 
property is called "fire and forget" abroad. (INTERNATIONAL 
DEFENSE REVIEW, 1987. No. 5.) 
  The capabilities of launching missiles in a direction away 
from one's aircraft, and a changing the thrust vector of their 
engines, are qualitatively new technical solutions in the 
projects being developed. These technical innovations make it 
possible to compensate for inadequacies in maneuverability of 
fighters, and to raise the maneuverability of the missiles. For 
the time being, the missiles are distinguished by broader limits 
of launch zones, higher speeds, interference resistance, and 
probability of target kill, and short-range missiles also by 
high maneuverability and resistance to high G forces (up to 60). 
(INTERAVIA, 1984. No. 9; AIR FORCE, 1985. No. 4) 
  The development of radars to control radars and also for 
other tasks holds a special place in scientific research and 
experimental design work abroad. The next-generation radars, 
designed for fighters on the basis of solid-state active-phased 
antenna arrays, their developers believe will be capable of 
operating simultaneously in several modes or of using all their 
energy in one mode, and will be part of a uniform system of 
flight and weapons control. In addition to radars, the designers 
will include in them IR sights, capable of detecting air targets 
at the same range as radars, electro-optic and navigation 
apparatus, multifunctional display assets, and aircraft and 
weapons control elements. Computers to assess the level of 
importance of detected targets, and rational launch zones of 
missiles, are also being developed. [FLIGHT, 1989. No. 4150] 
  Such systems, which combine data sensors for tracking air 
targets with scopes and control elements, will allow the 
accomplishment of many functions: optimization of altitude and 
height of flight, offensive and defensive maneuvers of fighters, 
processing of sight data for fire, detection and tracking of 
targets with automatic lock-on of the nearest of them. They will 
free the pilot of the need to perform these functions, and will 
permit the most favorable maneuver in an air-to-air battle. 
  Further increase in the range of detection of air targets, 
particularly those with reduced cross section, will remain one 
of the basic traditional directions in the development of radars 
of the new generation. This is understandable: the first to see 
the adversary gains victory. The designers strive to increase 
the power of radiation of the radars using, along with the 
pulsed mode, the pulsed-Doppler mode with coherent processing of 
signals and high frequency of repetition of the pulses. All 
these ways of increasing the range of action of radars have been 
known for a long time, but today no potentials are being 
identified in them. 
  It is very important to detect a target in a timely manner, 
but this is not everything. What pilot does not know how much 
precious time can be lost when after detecting a target, you 
don't know its affiliation and characteristics! After all, on 
the radar screens of modern fighters, the blips of all aircraft 
are identical, and the type and composition of a target can be 
judged only approximately, from the range of appearance of the 
blip on the screen. But the existing systems of "friend or foe" 
determine only the affiliation of a target, and even here the 
reliability is inadequate. They cannot be relied upon during 
active electronic warfare of the sides. Therefore the fighters 
will be tied down in their actions, and must refrain from 
delivering fire at ranges safe for them and most convenient for 
engaging the adversary. 
  Thus the pilot may clearly observe the blips of the air 
targets a good hundred kilometers away, but can neither make a 
decision nor open fire, no matter how long-range his missiles. 
In order to prevent engagement of friendly aircraft, he must 
close with the adversary for visual identification from external 
markings. But the more powerful and the longer the range of the 
weapons, the more fluid the situation in battle, the greater the 
need for full identification of air targets. 
  Timely identification of air targets was a serious problem 
for all generations of fighters. However today the prospects for 
resolving this problem, in the opinion of western specialists, 
is more remote than ever before. Searches for reliable means of 
identification are being conducted in the air forces of many 
countries. Different methods and devices are being sought to 
determine the type of targets, distinguish individual aircraft 
in dense combat formations, and discern their location in 
groups. Special devices for high-speed processing of radar 
signals, systems based on programmable processors, whose memory 
contains a whole group of emissions of equipment of the probable 
enemy, are being developed for analysis of target signs in the 
U.S. At the same time, equipment is being developed to discover 
the specific modulation of reflected signals for each type of 
aircraft due to the rotation of engine compressor blades. 
English specialists have great hopes for optical devices aimed 
at air targets using a radar, with subsequent conversion of the 
optical image to a television image. [FLIGHT, 1986. No. 4011] 
  Still, despite these innovations, seasoned experts shake 
their heads doubtfully. They believe that one of the basic and 
most reliable methods of identifying air targets in the future 
will continue to be continuous observation of their actions, 
beginning with takeoff, or from that part of air space where 
there are no friendly aircraft ("indirect identification of 
state affiliation"). In other words, a combination of long-range 
radar detection and identification of targets is predicted to 
have an important role. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No. 
8) But is this really the solution to the problem? 
  Such are the basic characteristic features of the new 
generation of fighter aircraft. However there is another 
tendency becoming evident, which must be considered to make the 
assessment of the state of the future aircraft inventory of 
fighter aviation complete. The fact is that construction of 
fundamentally new types of fighters will demand great economic 
expenses and a long time, and then with the presence of a large 
inventory of already developed aircraft. However it has been 
noted that in the current types now, it is not so much the 
design as the engines, armaments, and equipment which are 
growing old. Naturally the efforts of the aircraft designers are 
directed also toward modernization of earlier adopted aircraft 
now in serial production, along with development of new designs. 
  Western specialists believe that this tendency will continue 
to be completely valid in the future. It will make it possible 
to ensure an increment in the combat capabilities of fighters 
with the least expense. For many years the characteristics of 
familiar American fighters F-15 and F-16, adopted in the 
armament in 1972 and 1976, have been continuously improved. 
Their modifications have included new engines, improved radars, 
missiles, EW equipment, and navigational equipment. The program 
of modernization of the F-4F and "Tornado" aircraft in the FRG 
has been actively implemented. Plans are to replace some of the 
onboard electronic equipment and arm them with AMRAAM and HARM 
missiles. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 1986. No. 8; AVIATION 
WEEK, 1987. No. 6.) Western experts predict, and have no doubt, 
that they will surely become part of the aircraft inventory by 
the end of the century. 
<H5>  4. New-Generation Fighters in Battle </H5>
  The problems of tactics of the air-to-air battle on the 
threshold of the year 2000 attract our attention no less than 
the development of fighters of the next generation. Attempts of 
pilots to fly the new or modified aircraft with their old 
tactical baggage will not bring success, for they will not be 
able to fully realize the high combat capabilities of the new 
equipment. 
  Today the foundations of air-to-air combat are undergoing 
critical analysis and revision. Western specialists stress that 
for fighters with higher performance, powerful armaments, and 
highly automated systems, which open up for the pilots 
previously unattained possibilities, and offering great hopes, 
nonetheless the basic rules of air-to-air combat, developed and 
reinforced in past wars, will remain in force. Therefore foreign 
experts are oriented toward battles combining both new and old 
elements to some degree. 
  On this basis, the foreign press states that the regions of 
air-to- air battles may have to be greater in size, or they may 
be fought in a limited space. Their participants may be either 
single fighters, or subunits operating according to a uniform 
concept. However the more improved aircraft and their weapons 
systems will entail more decisive targets, higher activeness of 
the opposing sides, and diversity of tactical techniques. This 
is why the old techniques, which have demonstrated their 
effectiveness, will not die away, but will grow into new ones, 
flowing from the capabilities of the equipment, which must be 
expanded and deepened even more. 
  But what properties of the aircraft underlie such tactical 
techniques? First of all, the high thrust and capability of 
controlling aerodynamic forces. 
  The high thrust of new-generation fighters imposes its own 
features on the air-to-air battle, changing the role of the 
altitude advantage over the adversary and the nature of 
maneuvers. In the past the altitude advantage resolved a great 
deal. Descending to join battle, the fighters could increase 
their speed, could quickly catch up with the adversary, assume a 
favorable position, and conduct a surprise attack. When located 
below the adversary, they were deprived of this opportunity. The 
energy of the aircraft did not allow such maneuvers. But now 
thanks to their enormous thrust, the pilots at lower altitude 
than the adversary can quickly climb, can speed up not only in 
descent, and also conduct other maneuvers without preliminary 
climbs. Now the possibility of achieving surprise has become 
inversely proportional to altitude. The one flying higher is 
visible on the radar screen the farthest away, and has a harder 
time detecting a target against the background of the earth. 
  The capabilities of controlling aerodynamic forces in turn 
affect the nature of maneuver in an air-to-air battle. 
Short-radius turns, combat banks [razvorot], steep loops 
[petlya] and other similar traditional maneuvers, the components 
of tactical techniques, now may be supplemented by fundamentally 
new ones mentioned earlier: flat turns (without roll), and 
ascent and descent without a change in angle of pitch. 
  Let us assume that in the dynamics of battle we need to aim 
quickly and precisely, and for this we need to change the 
attitude of our aircraft within small limits ("steer the nose"). 
What must the pilot do? A rapid turn [dovorot] to the target (or 
away from it), launch of missiles and fire of cannon, and then 
restoration of the previous attitude. Such combat maneuvers make 
it possible not only to simplify and increase the zone of 
engagement of the weapons aimed forward, but may also confuse 
the adversary. 
  New weapons also make their contribution toward the tactics 
of the air battle. Fighters armed with missiles with various 
ranges of action will be able to fight at long, medium, and 
short range, to engage the adversary maneuvering with high G 
forces, from any direction. The classical scheme, combining 
maneuver and fire while trying to get on one another's tail and 
close to minimal range, under such conditions loses its dominant 
importance, while head-on attack, allowing maximum range of 
missile launch, on the contrary, will become more preferable. 
Such attacks even quite recently appeared to be impossible. Not 
even the bravest air warrior could manage to aim and hit a 
target without having long-range missiles at his disposal. Now 
closure can be at a trajectory close to straight. The air-to-air 
battle has become an all-aspect one. 
  For this reason, foreign military specialists believe, not 
without justification, that the capabilities of missiles will 
exert a greater influence on the nature of future battles than 
the performance of the aircraft. However some of them go further 
and assume that when each fighter has powerful weapons, the need 
will disappear for a joint buildup of efforts, and thus for a 
group battle of fighters. Duel situations, in their opinion, 
will prove to be more expedient, because they do not limit the 
maneuver and combat might of the wingmen. (PROCEEDINGS, 1984. 
January.) 
  Is this so? The tactics of aerial duelists or a group 
air-to-air battle with its fire interaction in the group? 
  The majority of military specialists abroad conclude that a 
single fighter even with the most powerful weapons will not be 
able to engage all the enemy aircraft in a large group target; 
in addition his aft hemisphere will be unprotected. But this 
means that the battle formation of fighters would consist of 
assault and support elements (escort, reserve, decoy, etc.), 
combined under a single command. Of course, great doubts are 
expressed today about the need for a decoy element. It is 
thought that new-generation fighters with powerful weapons 
cannot permit themselves such a "luxury." Naturally, besides the 
multiple aircraft battle, there will continue to be duel 
situations, but they can occur only under difficult 
meteorological conditions, and even in the course of a 
multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle. 
  In considering the standard variants of battle formations of 
sub-units, western experts conclude that for complete use of the 
capabilities of friendly weapons and ensurance of freedom of 
maneuver, before battle the fighters should move further and 
further away from one another, and the battle formations should 
disperse more and more widely. And the fighting strength of 
aircraft combined in a single group may be reduced. Here the 
traditional functions of leader and wingman require vital 
clarification in the smallest subunits -- pairs of fighters. 
(AIR FORCE, 1986. No. 4) 
  If the leader attacks a target, the wingman only monitors 
the 
air situation and covers his leader; he frequently returns to 
the airfield with his combat load unexpended. Fighters of the 
new generation also need to be divided into leaders and wingmen, 
but in order to rationally utilize all the power of their 
weapons, they would do better to move in an opon battle 
formation, close to the front, and both must be in readiness to 
attack. The one to attack the target will be the one in a more 
advantageous position. It will become the attacker, and the 
second pilot the covering element. The covering fighter then 
builds on the efforts of the attacking one. 
  Let us follow the dynamics of the standard air-to-air 
battle, 
in which foreign military specialists try to find new, 
non-standard solutions. In their opinion, the battle should be 
started from maximum range by active group attacks, in order to 
immediately scatter the battle formation of the adversary and 
reduce to naught his numerical superiority. However even an 
adversary possessing roughly the same destructive capabilities 
of his weapons will strive for analogous attacks. Therefore the 
initial tactical superiority will remain with the group or pilot 
who is able to first detect the adversary, assess the situation 
earlier, make a decision, and shift more rapidly to the attack. 
  But what tactical techniques are expedient in a first 
attack, 
which was earlier valued highly, and with the increase in power 
of fighter weapons, and the low effectiveness of repeat attacks, 
is acquiring decisive importance? One such technique, albeit 
familiar, but somewhat altered for new fighters, may be closing 
with the target at a height lower than the expected height of 
the target, with a subsequent surprise attack from the front and 
below. Then the adversary will be in a worse position, since the 
range of detection of his radar will be less against the 
background of the earth, and he will be deprived of the 
capability of a first attack. 
  Still, inconspicuous fighters, with a significantly reduced 
radar cross section and intensity of IR emission will have the 
best opportunities for a surprise attack. The range of detection 
of such fighters by onboard radars of enemy aircraft, according 
to the foreign press, will be reduced to 20-25 km, and the 
lock-on range to 15 km. The range of lock-on of targets by 
missiles with active homing heads, not receiving stable signals 
from inconspicuous aircraft, will be reduced accordingly. 
(AVIATION WEEK, 1988. No. 11) Therefore the pilots who first 
detect the adversary will be able to covertly close with him and 
attack him first (Figure 30). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-33A>      Figure 30. Inconspicuous fighters armed with AMRAAM missiles on the attack </FIG>


  Here one interesting circumstance arises. If the opposing 
side has similar inconspicuous fighters, the battle of the 
"invisibles," western specialists believe, will acquire quite a 
different nature and will require other tactical techniques. 
Here the attacks on the forward hemisphere will be extremely 
difficult due to the short range of detection of the targets, 
and all the features of close air-to-air combat, when fighters 
still did not have radar sights, or long-range missiles, will 
come to the fore. A return to the past? In some ways, yes! 
  The tactical techniques of joining battle should allow the 
fighters not only to detect the adversary first, but also to 
engage the maximum number of targets. Here new missiles with 
active homing systems will come to the fore, which do not 
require illumination of the enemy aircraft, whose launch from 
each fighter is possible almost simultaneously against several 
targets (AMRAAM). The first attack of inconspicuous fighters 
using such missiles, possessing the property of "fire and 
forget," will immediately acquire new features. Its concept may 
be as follows: upon detecting a target or group of targets, 
pilots will begin covert closure with them. The group commander 
will distribute individual enemy aircaft among the wingmen in 
order to avoid multiple engagement of them (it is recommended 
that the commander himself select the most important target). 
  One necessary digression. In order to distribute targets 
correctly, the command must know precisely the number and 
location of the enemy planes in the group. When the commander 
does not see it visually, and when there are conditions of a 
difficult jamming situation, this is not easy to do. Therefore, 
as long as the fighters do not have reliable devices to identify 
targets, they require additional information, which may be sent 
to them from a ground or airborne command post. 
  After distribution of targets among the pilots, each 
distributes the missiles on board among the earmarked planes. 
Then there remains little to do: execute the launch and "forget" 
the missiles, and then execute an evasive maneuver in order to 
avoid retaliatory fire. The attack is maximally simplified. Then 
the commander organizes a repeat attack against targets which 
survive the first, or the pilots begin to search for other 
targets. (PROCEEDINGS. 1984. January; AIR FORCE, 1985, No. 4) 
  However an air-to-air battle will scarcely have the nature 
of 
an exchange of missile strikes only from long range. The 
adversary may obtain timely information, and then he will do 
everything in order to create a powerful electronic 
counteraction, to "blind" the pilots, to hamper them in using a 
specific type of missile, and to foil his long-range strike. One 
cannot underestimate his capabilities, especially with respect 
to inconspicuous fighters, in achieving surprise, when they turn 
up at close range, ruling out the use of long-range missiles. 
One should not forget the difficulty of instrument 
identification of targets. And indeed, the pilots themselves may 
aim poorly or commit other errors, so that long-range attacks 
prove unsuccessful. What happens if the whole reserve of 
long-range missiles is expended in the battle? In all these 
cases an air-to-air battle started at long range may then become 
a close-range combat. 
  Close-range air-to-air combat played a decisive role in 
local 
wars of the 70s and 80s. Thus in the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, 
the Israeli pilots shot down 310 of the 450 Arab planes they 
destroyed in close-range combat. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE REVIEW, 
1985, No. 8) And even though, in the opinion of some western 
observers, there will be no place for such battles in the future 
(it will be more advantageous for fighters to return to the 
airfield and top off their missile reserve than to continue to 
close with targets), the close-in battles themselves stubbornly 
ignore their lack of recognition, and the latest concepts. What 
is more, recently an instruction was introduced to the program 
of training of NATO tactical pilots regarding conclusion of each 
training flight for air-to-air combat with energetic maneuvering 
as applied to the conditions of close-range combat. 
(PROCEEDINGS, 1984. January) 
  The main distinguishing characteristics of close-range 
combat, which will basically retain its former aspect, will be 
visual contact between the planes fighting the battle, and the 
use of short-range weapons. At the same time, new features will 
inevitably appear: a speeding up of battle dynamics, a reduction 
in the time between attacks, an increase in the probability of a 
kill of aircraft of the opposing sides. In aircraft with high 
thrust-to-weight ratios and acceleration characteristics, 
possessing missiles with autonomous guidance after launch, the 
pilots may more quickly conclude attacks, restore lost speed, 
and catch up with an adversary fleeing attack. These new 
features not only expand the capabilities of the fighters, but 
also make combat more dangerous for all of its participants. It 
has become much easier to kill a target, but also more difficult 
to defend oneself. Here the danger of collision has grown, 
especially in attacks at high aspect angles. 
  In accordance with the changed conditions of air-to-air 
combat, pilots are required to use new tactical techniques, 
combining sharp maneuvers of short duration with the attainment 
of high acceleration. Such techniques, based on control of 
aerodynamic forces, create the most favorable conditions for 
precise fire with cannon, and for missile launch. But despite 
the most clever maneuvers, even well-trained pilots may lose the 
battle at its very start, if they do not combine these maneuvers 
with electronic suppression of weapons sights and homing heads 
of the enemy missiles. There is still no alternative to 
electronic warfare. Switch-on of active jammers, dispensing of 
dipole reflects, and firing of IR decoys to disrupt missile 
guidance and lure them in false directions, these pilot actions 
must vitally supplement the picture of the battle of tommorrow's 
fighters. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The tactics of fighter aviation involve complex combat 
equipment, and with each new type of aircraft and weapon, it 
must seek new tactical techniques which are frequently 
dissimilar to, and sometimes unique in past practice. If you put 
a pilot of a future fighter in the cockpit of a MiG-23, say, I 
don't know how he would do. There is no computer, to which he 
has grown accustomed, no display with precise information on the 
tactical situation either, maneuvers based on high 
thrust-to-weight ratio and control of aerodynamic forces are 
impossible. Under such conditions the pilot would simply be 
unable to fight. 
  Perhaps this is an ingenuous comparison, but it does give 
food for thought. For if you think about it, how eloquent here 
the manifestation of interrelations of tactics and outmoded 
equipment. Therefore, if we try to look into the 21st century, 
then will we become witnesses, and perhaps even participants in 
the new contradictions between tactics and equipment. In order 
to resolve these contradictions and realize the high potential 
capabilities of new-generation fighters, we will also need to 
resolve other difficult problems, one of which is the air 
adversary and his tactics. 
<H5>  Chapter III. In Sharp Confrontation with Offensive Aviation </H5>
  Bombers and fighters... It is a good seven decades now since 
they came into the world, and for all these decades have been 
fraught with the sharp confrontation between them. The 
interrelations determining their development and improvement are 
familiar. The very advent of the bombers called the fighter to 
life, and it in turn led to the mounting of defensive weapons on 
bombers, to the armoring of vulnerable points, to the protection 
of gas tanks. Development of the defensive assets of bombers 
brought forth further improvement in the armament of fighters: 
the transition from machine-guns to cannon, then to missiles. 
But similar relationships existed and exist between aviation 
delivering strikes on troops and rear installations (let us call 
it offensive aviation) and fighter aviation protecting them from 
air strikes. The changes in tactics of one of the sides will 
always entail the corresponding changes in the tactics of the 
other. In tracing this dialectical, law-governed regularity, 
which has been manifested quite clearly for many decades, we can 
judge the development of the tactics of fighter aviation, 
considering it within the framework of the general air defense 
system with which the fighters jointly repel the raids of the 
air adversary. 
<H5>  1. Under the Onslaught of Offensive Aviation </H5>
  The confrontation of Soviet fighter aviation and the 
Hitlerite Luftwaffe began literally in the first minutes of the 
Great Patriotic War, when the fascist bombers hit hard at our 
cities and military installations. In the very first days of the 
war, acting almost with impunity, the enemy was able to inflict 
severe damage on troops and rear installations and the system of 
air defense itself. 
  There were many reasons for such catastrophic consequences 
of 
the air strikes. Much has been said and written about these 
reasons. Military historians note that right on the eve of war, 
the advent of bomber aircraft in the air forces of fascist 
Germany which were more dangerous than their predecessors, and 
the mass nature of their use significantly improved the chances 
of the aviation in battle against air defense. Of course the 
natural lag of defensive means behind offensive means, although 
it did exist, was not the only reason for the situation that had 
been created. 
  Much postwar literature stresses the aggressor's material 
superiority in forces, and his use of the factor of surprise. 
The dramatic picture of disorganization and haplessness of the 
air defense, including fighter aviation, in the repulse of first 
massed enemy raids is explained by omissions in the training of 
the Armed Forces for war, military-political errors of the 
leadership, and the significant combat experience of the 
Hitlerite aviation, which had been able to practice the 
suppression of air defense systems of European countries and was 
cloaked in an aura of invincibility. (At the start of the Second 
World War, massed air strikes against Polish airfields, 
antiaircraft positions, and command and control centers, in 
which the attack of 2,000 Luftwaffe planes was opposed by about 
140 fighters, had the result that the air defense system of 
Poland virtually ceased to exist in the very first days of the 
war. As a result of such massed strikes on French, Dutch, and 
Belgian airfields, where a large number of fighters were 
destroyed, the aggressor was able to shift to delivery of 
strikes on other targets without significant resistance of the 
fighter aviation of these countries (HISTORY OF THE SECOND WORLD 
WAR, 1939-1945. Vol. 3. M.: Voyenizdat, 1974)) All these things 
are true, of course. But publications pay significantly less 
attention to the tactical aspects of the confrontation of 
fighter aviation with the air adversary, which was also an 
important cause of the failures. 
  Fascist bombers operated at low and medium altitudes (from 
500 to 3,000 meters) in large groups, almost without fighter 
cover, made so-called "star raids," arriving at their targets 
from different directions, and repeated the raids several times. 
What could fighter aviation do to oppose them? Low in numbers 
because of losses inflicted on the ground, and inferior to the 
enemy in tactical performance of the aircraft, it was committed 
to battle too late and discredited itself becuase of its rare 
appearances over protected targets. Frontline fighters, even 
while on the airfields in immediate readiness for a sortie, did 
not have time to meet the enemy. Air defense fighters, 
possessing a longer enemy warning range than front-line 
fighters, often intercepted the enemy using data obtained from 
forward observation posts. However due to the unreliable warning 
system, most often the fighters had to continuously patrol in 
the air, hoping for an accidental encounter with the adversary. 
So their actions often proved unfruitful. 
  All these defects and omissions had a negative affect on the 
confrontation of the sides, as, incidentally, on the air defense 
of other countries. Military specialists concluded that the 
aviation had passed the combat equipment and tactics of air 
defense in its development. 
  While restraining with all its might the onslaught of 
offensive aviation, the fighters continuously revised and 
improved their tactics. Changes could not take place overnight, 
however. Before, the pilots had drawn their tactical wisdom from 
the experience of the past, but now every day brought such 
contradictory opinions, and confronted them with such unexpected 
problems that only through profound analysis of air situations 
could correct tactical recommendations be extracted from them. 
  Proven tactical techniques, which were tested by bitter 
experience and had no analogues in the past, and the higher 
tactical performance of planes entering the armament of fighter 
aviation did their work, and further development of events 
proved a surprise to Hitlerite aviation. Its massed raids were 
opposed by a concentration of fighters forced in decisive axes, 
and by more sophisticated tactical techniques. Already the 
tactics of offensive aviation were seen to lag behind those of 
fighter aviation. 
  In order to even out the situation somewhat, the Hitlerites 
had to abandon the repeated raids on targets from different 
directions, which demanded a great expenditure of forces, and 
switched to actions in dense, less vulnerable battle formations. 
The bombers reached their targets while changing directions and 
altitudes, and, avoiding rote actions, sought to mislead the 
fighters. The crews of the aircraft planned their routes so as 
to create the impression that they were flying toward specific 
targets, but then at the last moment would suddenly change 
course and turn toward their planned targets. Another tactical 
technique was the delivery of diversionary strikes on secondary 
targets, while the main forces acted against the planned 
targets. Fighter protection of the "Junkers" and "Heinkels" was 
beefed up, and more forces began to be assigned to tie down our 
fighters in battle and blockade their airfields. 
  Because of the dialectical relationship between offensive 
weapons and defensive ones, the confrontation between them in 
the subsequent course of battle ran with variable success. But 
it always favored the side which used new types of aircraft and 
concentrated large forces, allowed for the tactical innovations 
of the other side, and quickly introduced correctives to its own 
tactics in response to them. 
  By the end of the war fighter aviation had been transformed 
into a terrifying adversary of fascist aviation. Possessing 
decisive superiority in forces, it operated in accordance with a 
uniform concept, and used maneuver of large forces extensively. 
Front-line fighters were the first to encounter the enemy, and 
their efforts were augmented by air defense aviation. Fascist 
aviation still continued its raids, but when encountering the 
opposition of fighter aviation, coordinated with respect to 
target, time, and space, it gradually reduced its activeness. 
Even such well-armed aircraft as the J-88 and He-111 could not 
break through to their targets without substantial losses. In 
confrontation with fighter aviation the enemy tried to 
concentrate the forces of his aviation in individual sectors by 
maneuver, creating special ace elements which arrived ahead of 
time in the regions of upcoming action. The bombers sought to 
reduce their time in regions within range of aviation, and 
increased bombing altitudes, but such new tactical elements 
reduced the effectiveness of strikes. 
  Experience of the Great Patriotic War exerted a great 
influence on the nature of further confrontation between 
fighters and offensive aviation in the postwar years, but the 
adoption of nuclear weapons into the armament of the sides was a 
powerful stimulus for its development. When aviation had only 
conventional high-explosive and incendiary bombs, hundreds of 
bombers were necessary to destroy targets of average dimensions. 
If the air defense managed to keep the greater part of these 
bombers from reaching the target, it was considered to be 
successful, since the bombs dropped by the bombers breaking 
through to the target were insufficient to destroy it. With the 
advent of nuclear weapons, however, one plane armed with an atom 
bomb could take the place of more conventionally-armed bombers 
than any power in the world had, and its penetration to a major 
target threatened colossal destruction and countless victims. 
  The tactics of aviation also changed radically. In massed 
flights instead of dense battle formations, all at once there 
were actions of a large number of single planes and small groups 
of planes, dispersed in front and in depth. The simultaneous 
appearance in the air of many independently operating targets 
approaching the strike objectives from different directions, in 
combination with jamming, put fighter aviation in a difficult 
situation. Single enemy aircraft, which before had seemed easy 
pickings for fighters, had become hard-to-kill, fast-moving, 
high-altitude targets. 
  Foreign military specialists proved that it was a fantasy to 
think that all aircraft carrying nuclear weapons could be 
intercepted by existing air defense systems, given their limited 
capabilities against a simultaneous fighter attack, without 
fundamentally new air defense weapons and methods of their 
delivery, which of course did not yet exist. "The probability of 
destruction of aircraft must be the same at any point of a 
defended space," the French military journal FORCE ARMEE 
FRANCAISE noted. "As soon as the adversary discovers an unequal 
distribution of defensive assets, he will attack from a safe 
axis." (FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1973, No. 8, p 34.) 
  This is why, due to that same dialectical relation between 
offensive and defensive weapons, the confrontation between 
fighter and offensive aviation flared up with new force in the 
mid 1950s. This was also because of the transition of aviation 
from piston aircraft to jet, with more sophisticated armaments. 
  The development of aviation tactics in the very first 
postwar 
local wars occurred especially rapidly. As early as the Korean 
War, beginning in 1952, American aviation began to operate in a 
different way when encountering active opposition from the 
fighter aviation of the KPA [Korean People's Army]. They 
delivered strikes simultaneously against many objectives, using 
a large number of forces, and were supported by various 
disinformation measures in order to dissipate the efforts of the 
fighter aviation. 
  Here is just one example. On 10 January 1953, about 300 
tactical F-80 and F-84 fighters participated in a massed strike 
and delivered strikes on nine road and railroad bridges on the 
territory of the Korean People's Democratic Republic. The 
approach of the main forces to the lines of radar detection and 
their arrival at the targets were masked by jamming aircraft and 
by the suppression of radars in false axes, by transmission of 
false orders regarding the time and targets of strikes in 
aviation radio nets in clear text, and also by special decoy 
groups. (See: Stuart, J. Vozdushnaya moshch -- reshayushchaya 
sila v Koree [Air Power -- a Decisive Force in Korea). M., 
Foreign Literature Publishing House, 1959, p. 151) 
  A serious impetus to the confrontation of tactics was 
provided by the aggressive U.S. war in Southeast Asia. Attempts 
of offensive aviation to operate without changing its prior 
tactics resulted in heavy losses. Of course, at the start of the 
war, taking advantage of the absence of an organized air 
defense, American aviation operated almost without hindrance, 
chiefly at medium altitudes, and the crews of the planes did not 
use any new tactical techniques. They differed little from 
actions against [practice) targets, which did not return fire. 
  But what happened later on? Later a quite unexpected turn of 
events occurred. The aviation of the interventionists was not 
able to break through the missile barrier which appeared in the 
DRV [Democratic Republic of Vietnam] in 1965. In the first 
battle on 26 June, Vietnamese SAM systems shot down three F-4 
Phantoms at one time. (Hai Thu. North Vietnam Versus the U.S. 
Air Force. Hanoi, 1968. p. 16) This had never happened before, 
or at least it was very rare. 
  This lesson forced the offensive aviation to improve its 
tactics. The appearance of SAM systems inevitably provoked a 
response on its part. How could aircraft forced to enter the 
kill zones of the SAMs be protected? At first the efforts of 
military specialists were directed toward developing onboard 
apparatus to warn of the launch of SAMs and detect the missiles 
themselves. It was necessary to detect them at sufficiently 
great distances from the aircraft for the crews to have time to 
take protective steps, but attempts to develop such apparatus 
were not crowned by success. It was necessary to look for weak 
points in the air defense system, and to allocate significant 
forces for suppression, exceeding several times over the 
strength of the assault elements, and to develop means and 
tactics for combatting SAM systems. 
  It was easiest to detect SAM systems from long range based 
on 
the operation of their target designation and missile guidance 
radars. So-called anti-radar aircraft appeared which were 
equipped with receiver/direction finders. They were supposed to 
determine the coordinates of the radar-targets and guide 
air-defense suppression elements to them. This was not a bad 
idea, but without the means to measure the range to the targets 
it was impossible to determine the precise location of the 
sources of radar emission, and triangulation methods had still 
not been mastered. Nor did it ensure simultaneous detection of 
several SAM systems and their guidance systems, the number of 
which continued to grow. More sophisticated anti-radar aircraft 
with improved apparatus for electronics intelligence (F4G Wild 
Weasel) were developed much later, with a lag of some fifteen 
years behind the level of development of air defense. 
  It was also necessary to have some means of engaging the SAM 
systems, also from long range. These were the Shrike anti-radar 
missiles, which homed in on the operating radars. These missiles 
were used for the first time in Vietnam, but had short range 
(14-16 km), and when the radar stations were switched off by the 
SAM crews they were knocked off course, and even retargeted 
themselves on their own against other more powerful energy 
sources. A result of ignoring this fact was that one day a 
Shrike missile hit a shipboard radar of the American cruiser 
"Warden" in the Tonkin Gulf instead of the Vietnamese SAM 
system. The former was put out of commission and was sent to the 
Philippines for repairs. 
  The airborne EW assets grew more and more diverse, but 
control of them was manual and each operated in isolation. Even 
in their aggregate they could no longer ensure effective 
counteraction to the operation of air defense electronic systems. 
  Another circumstance also arose for aviation. When cannon 
were replaced by air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles, with 
their powerful warheads and high firing accuracy, the problem of 
survival of aircraft in the air was exacerbated. Survival became 
as important as speed, maneuverability, and other 
characteristics. This was mentioned in chapter II, but it is 
important to stress it again, because the ways of enhancing 
survival listed in Table 1 could no longer save aviation from 
the deadly fire of SAM systems and fighters. The problem had to 
be solved not so much in the military-technical context as in 
the tactical context. 
  Since the whole group of counteractive means and tactical 
techniques of crews was exhausted and did not bring the expected 
results, foreign military scientists and designers directed 
their efforts toward increasing the range of airborne weapons in 
order to preclude the entry of the aircraft into the kill zones 
of the SAM systems. This was a reassuring direction in the 
struggle against them. The results were the gliding guided 
aerial bombs and missiles with electro-optical and, later on, 
laser guidance. Tactical techniques were also developed, whose 
essence boiled down to using different deceptive maneuvers for 
covert approach to bomb release and missile launch lines. 
  It seemed that a way out of the critical situation had been 
found: aviation could deliver strikes on targets without 
entering the SAM zones, or at least could spend minimal amount 
of time in them. Now air defense was in a difficult situation, 
and all the burden of combatting the airborne platforms of the 
new weapons was carried by fighter aviation. 
<H5>  2. History Repeats Itself </H5>
  One encounters surprising coincidences in the history of 
tactics. Strange as it may seem, in tracing the process of the 
confrontation of fighter aviation with the air enemy, at times 
we run into one and the same, seemingly long resolved problems, 
which have cropped up again. One of them, for example, was the 
battle with offensive aviation at low altitudes. At first glance 
it would seem that there was nothing new here. Fighters were 
repelling strikes from ground-hugging altitude back in the 
Second World War. However in flight at an altitude of several 
hundred meters, under the radar "lobes," the time of approach 
and deployment of the aircraft in the vectoring regions of the 
fighters grew so limited that there could be no question of 
timely intercept of targets. Beside this, difficulties lay in 
wait for pilots at low altitudes. On the one hand, due to the 
limited range of detection of aviation, they could not climb in 
time, and, on the other, even if they did manage to do so, the 
control centers would not have time to guide them toward enemy 
aircraft, and the pilots would have to search them out 
themselves. But how can one look for low-flying targets if the 
screens of the airborne scopes are filled with ground clutter? 
Interception was also hindered by restrictions on speed, 
maneuverability, and increased fuel expenditure in fighters, and 
difficulties in piloting. According to statistical data, more 
than 50 percent of air accidents in the U.S. Air Force occurring 
through the fault of the pilots during the day, under visual 
flight conditions, occurred at low altitudes, while performing 
turns or horizontal maneuvers, while their flight time at an 
altitude of 300 meters or less made up only 10 percent of total 
flight time. (AVIATION WEEK, 1985. No. 1) 
  This is why during the war in Vietnam and in subsequent 
local 
wars, the use of low altitudes by aviation, where it could 
covertly approach objectives and attack them with surprise, 
became most important in tactics. By hugging the ground to 
reduce the possible range of detection, and by using special 
apparatus allowing prolonged flight with terrain following and 
obstacle avoidance, the crews could operate under any weather 
conditions day or night, and deliver strikes without visual 
contact with the targets. 
  This is why the air defense, in retaliation, began to 
organize unbroken low-altitude radar fields, create a special 
system to warn of the flight of low-flying targets, began to 
modernize sights and weapons, and improve the tactical 
techniques of fighters. Nonetheless, the problem of timely 
detection of low-flying targets became the main one, and the 
most complex, for fighter aviation. Subsequently it developed 
into the independent problem of all-weather long-range aircraft 
detection, and rapid warning of all forces and assets of air 
defense. 
  We have already considered this problem in examining the 
confrontation of fighter aviation with fascist aviation, but 
history has repeated itself. The fact is that as the flight 
speeds of aircraft and the launch range of airborne weapons have 
increased, it has become necessary for fighters to repel air 
raids at longer and longer range from defended objectives. As 
long as these speeds were relatively low and aviation did not 
have guided bombs and missiles, the limited capabilities of 
ground radars with respect to range of detection were not so 
important. But now aviation was approaching the sound barrier, 
and fighter aviation, despite the growth of combat capabilities, 
was no longer able to commit adequate battle forces to repel 
raids not only at low altitudes, but at other altitudes as well, 
and could not realize the tactical radius of fighters to combat 
aviation at the maximal ranges of their fuel reserve. 
  To increase the range of detection of aviation, the efforts 
of designers and engineers of many countries were directed 
toward raising the power of radar transmitters and improving the 
sensitivity of receiving devices, toward changing the types of 
antennas, and putting them on hills and high masts. As a result 
new models of radars appeared, with better resolution and 
resistance to jamming, and higher accuracy in determining target 
coordinates. But what of range of operation? Alas, it increased 
comparatively little. It became clear that the problem would be 
hard to resolve in that way. 
  It proved possible to radically increase the range of 
detection by mounting radars on airborne platforms: planes, 
helicopters, and dirigibles. Here the radar antennas were put on 
a kilometer-high hill, so to speak. However only those radars 
which used the pulsed-Doppler method, which makes it possible to 
follow aerial targets against the background of the ground or 
water surface, could be "raised to the sky." To do this it was 
necessary to solve a number of purely technical problems, i.e., 
to develop special antennas and control apparatus, reduce their 
mass and size, and seek out new methods of detection of fast and 
low-altitude targets. In this regard, in the development of 
airborne platforms, their capabilities for carrying radar 
equipment were considered more important than their tactical 
performance. The basic requirements were merely high carrying 
capacity and flight time. 
  As a result of years of research and development begun in 
the 
60s, radar early warning aircraft equipped with surveillance 
radars were designed, and the efforts of the military industry 
abroad were concentrated on development of whole aircraft 
systems for long-range radar detection and control. Such a 
system (AWACS) was developed at the end of the 70s in the U.S. 
Possessing E-3A aircraft (Figure 31--[not reproduced]) equipped 
with powerful radars, high-speed computers, and equipment for 
processing and transmission of information and for situation 
display, it still continues to operate without vital changes in 
functions in the air defense system of the North American 
continent and in the armed forces of the NATO bloc. 
  Adoption of airborne early warning aircraft in the air 
defense systems, and their mass use, drastically changed the 
situation in favor of fighter aviation. The radar field 
immediately shifted to the depth of the territory of the 
opposing side, and continuous surveillance of the air situation 
and control of fighters over an enormous depth was ensured, not 
only at high altitude, but at low as well. Thus, according to 
the data of the foreign press, the aforementioned AWACS system 
allows surveillance of air space over an area of 31,000 sq. km, 
detection of aerial targets and guidance of fighters at ranges 
of up to 600 km at high altitudes, and up to 400 km at low. Here 
it is possible to detect up to 600 targets and track 250 of 
them. (AIR FORCE MAGAZINE, 1984, No. 6) 
  Behind these numbers stands the whole problem, with aspects 
reassuring to fighter aviation and alarming to offensive 
aviation. On the one hand, the necessary range of detection of 
aviation and timely scrambling of fighters to repel its raids 
were achieved, and their control during commitment to battle and 
in battle were assured, while on the other hand the capabilities 
of aviation to achieve covertness and surprise of action became 
problematic. In addition, airborne radar systems became in 
themselves more survivable. Ground radars had permanent 
coordinates which could be determined ahead of time by aviation 
even in those cases when they were not operating. But airborne 
radars were mobile and could elude the sight of the adversary by 
ceasing operation and changing location. 
  Airborne early warning and control systems, allowing 
detection of targets against ground clutter, seemingly made it 
ill-advised for aviation to approach the targets of a strike at 
low altitude -- the only tactical technique allowing crews to 
evade the detection by radar. After all, all other techniques 
demanded preliminary suppression of air defense assets in the 
zone of flight. It seemed that an insurmountable barrier had 
been put in the way of aviation. Fighter pilots sighed in 
relief: the onslaught of aviation had been reliably repulsed. 
But their joy was premature. Aviation quickly reacted to the 
next innovation, and other ways to accomplish their missions 
were found. 
  One such way was the use of early warning and control 
aircraft by aviation in its own interests. First efforts in this 
direction were taken back in Vietnam in raids by American 
strategic bombers on the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. Along 
with the bombers, or somewhat ahead of them, EC-121K "Warning 
Star" and E-2A "Hawkeye" aircraft took off to perform the 
functions of airborne command posts. They conducted surveillance 
of the air situation, warned the crews of the approach of 
Vietnamese fighters, and issued target designations to their 
fighters, F-4 Phantoms. Later on, in 1982, early-warning 
aircraft, now the E-2C Hawkeye, were used extensively in 
Israel's aggression in Lebanon. (AIR FORCE, 1986, No. 4) 
  Another such method, which appeared in the Arab-Israeli war 
of 1973, was the sharp increase in electronic warfare (EW). The 
tactics of aviation in combatting fighter aviation were marked 
by the variety of the EW assets used. Combined jamming (active 
noise, response-pulse jamming, and passive jamming) were used 
against command and control centers and airborne weapons radars, 
both by special jammers and by combat aircraft. Dipole 
reflectors and IR decoys were used against missiles with radar 
and heat-seeking homing heads. 
  Electronic warfare was used even more in Lebanon, where 
Israeli aviation first laid down massive jamming in the region 
of combat action, then delivered strikes under its cover against 
the SAM positions and actively jammed the fighter's command and 
control centers and the fighters in the air, and only then did 
the assault elements enter the region. All this resulted in 
almost complete disruption of the command and control of fighter 
aviation, and offensive aviation accomplished its missions 
without significant losses. (AIR FORCE, 1982, No. 7; MILITARY 
TECHNOLOGY, 1984, No. 7) 
  In the comparatively small and brief military conflict of 
the 
U.S. in Libya in March-April 1986, events developed analogously, 
but the air tactics were structured on a more sophisticated 
technical foundation. Before the start of the American air 
raids, Libya's air defense system was carefully reconnoitered by 
reconnaissance satellites and early warning aircraft, and active 
and passive jamming of great intensity was directed against 
ground radars, homing heads, and radar proximity fuses of 
missiles. New high-speed (up to M 3.5) HARM missiles, equipped 
with broadband homing heads which "memorized" the direction of 
the radar after it was switched off, replaced the Shrike 
anti-radar missiles. Launch range of the missiles had reached 80 
km, and the crews could use them without entering the kill zones 
of the SAM systems. 
  Subsequently the anti-radar aircraft, or Wild Weasel system, 
which had earned its right to exist back in Vietnam, experienced 
a rebirth. They directed the search of radar targets, selected 
the most dangerous of them, and issued target designations to 
air defense suppression elements. Cluster bombs and anti-radar 
missiles began to be mounted on these aircraft, and new elements 
in crew tactics were noted. Anti-radar aircraft were to be the 
first to begin suppressing the air defense, without entering the 
kill zone of the SAMs, and jointly with combat aircraft to 
support flight to the targets of the assault elements, creating 
safe corridors for penetration to the planned targets. In turn 
the pilots masked the launch of anti-radar missiles with 
jamming, and they were often able to achieve surprise. All this 
reduced the survivability of air defenses, and prevented them 
from rapidly restoring combat readiness. 
  It seemed that the air defense system could no longer stand 
up to the indestructible onslaught of aviation. But one has to 
know dialectics. It seeks and finds ways out of the most 
hopeless situations. Attainments of aviation in the field of 
electronic warfare sharply exacerbated the confrontation of 
tactics and lent new stimulus to the development of EW assets of 
the opposing side. Radar jamming, decoy targets? But there are 
other ways of combatting them. There were new studies and 
experiments, and then air defense had other electronic systems 
with greater energy potential, phased-array radar antennas, and 
more reliable receiving devices with enhanced signal-processing 
quality using super high-speed integrated circuits. Anti-radar 
missiles? These were countered by long-range SAM systems, which 
pushed the missile platforms to the limits of their launch, 
radar emitters which guided the missiles out of their 
trajectory, and various deceptive and masking measures. Jamming 
equipment appeared on the fighters themselves. Other EW assets 
were developed and improved, and became part of the air defense 
elements. Electronic warfare ceased to be conducted 
unilaterally, only by aviation. 
  These attainments in raising the interference resistance of 
air defense systems were so great that they gave ground for the 
claims of military experts that assets as anti-radar reflectors 
and transmitters, emitting noise and response-pulse jamming, 
would soon become ineffective. 
  And aviation? Indeed, it had difficulty suppressing all air 
defense assets. Their number reached astronomical figures. 
Radars of different bands, pulsed and pulsed-doppler with 
different methods of protection against jamming, they filled the 
air with millions of pulses per second. It was necessary to 
select and suppress those of them which posed the immediate 
threat. 
  Meanwhile a new barrier had arisen before fighter aviation, 
and a new enemy became visible -- cruise missiles. I should say 
at once that history again repeated itself, these missiles were 
already familiar weapons. Their prototypes were known back in 
the second World War (the FAU-1 aircraft-projectiles) and were 
developed in the U.S. in the postwar years ("Regulus," "Snark," 
"Mace") but interest in them declined with the advent of 
intercontinental ballistic missiles. Development of cruise 
missiles was renewed many years later, only in the mid-70s, when 
development of science and technology made it possible to create 
small gas-turbine engines ensuring a low specific consumption of 
fuel, to reduce dimensions and mass of the missiles, and to 
raise the accuracy of the guidance systems. The number of types 
of missiles under development increased swiftly, and their range 
and accuracy grew. 
  Back in 1978 the U.S. conducted first experimental launches 
of the "Tomahawk" tactical missiles against ground targets 
(TLAM-C), in 1979, from ground launchers (GLCM), and in 1980 
strategic cruise missiles, launched from aircraft, appeared 
(ALCM). Fitted with inertial guidance systems, supporting their 
flight to targets at maximally low altitudes, and armed with 
nuclear or conventional warheads, cruise missiles could reach 
targets several hundred to several thousand kilometers away. 
(INTERAVIA, 1981, No. 12). 
  Following the cruise missiles, drones (BLA) joined the 
battle 
against fighter aviation. Subsonic and supersonic, with a mass 
from 90 kg to 4.5 t, they were intended for the conduct of 
reconnaissance, radioelectronic suppression, the delivery of 
strikes against air defense assets, and correction of artillery 
fire. The low cost of these drones makes it possible to use them 
on a mass scale, and their small size also makes them less 
vulnerable to air defense weapons. 
  Such properties of cruise missiles and drones again put the 
fighters and all air defense in a difficult position. After all, 
the radar cross section of these aerial targets was so low that 
on the screens of ground radars and onboard weapons sights they 
appear scarcely noticeable, now flickering, now disappearing, 
now merging with "ground clutter," now points lost in the 
jamming. 
  The tactics of Israeli aviation relied on precisely these 
properties of drones in 1973 and in the armed conflict in 
Lebanon in 1982. Using drones, they first determined the 
location and parameters of operation of the air defense assets 
of the Arab countries, and then launched strikes against them 
with piloted aircraft. Here the drones were used to lay down a 
curtain of dipole reflectors and as dummy targets to provoke the 
SAM complexes and antiaircraft artillery to open fire. (NATO's 
FIFTEEN NATIONS, 1985, August). 
  The first drones were shot down by fighters back in Vietnam 
(Figure 32 [not reproduced]), but the experience obtained 
demonstrated that to combat such qualitatively different, small 
targets required a different approach, different assets for 
their detection and identification, weapons which had a very 
short reaction time, increased accuracy and rate of fire. And 
again one detected a lag of fighter aviation behind the level of 
development of offensive air weapons, and again it was faced 
with the need of further development of tactics on the basis of 
new equipment. But after all, the means of defense will not 
appear before the means of offense. 
  The conflict between offense and fighter aviation breaks out 
with new force. What can fighters use to oppose their adversary 
today? Tracing the paths of development of tactics of the 
opposing sides, based on what has already occurred, we will now 
make a few generalizations, and analyze how this objective 
law-governed regularity is manifested today, and sketch a 
"portrait" of the offensive aviation with which our fighters 
must be ready to join in battle, recalling that it will be a 
joint battle with ground air defense assets. 
<H5>  3. Who Must Fighters Fight Today </H5>
  As any complex phenomenon, the tactics of present-day 
aviation include many components. In their content one can 
distinguish first of all the changes in the disposition and 
combat formations of groups, profiles of flight to the targets 
of a strike and tactical techniques to attain secrecy and 
suppress air defense, and, very importantly, two different 
tendencies: 
  --penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of 
"force"; 
  --avoidance of action of forces and resources of air defense 
of the adversary. 
  Of course these tendencies are not new, but judging from the 
views of the NATO military leaders, and the experience of 
exercises, and also the most recent local wars and military 
conflicts, they are acquiring new content. 
  Penetration to the strike objectives on the principle of 
"force" presupposes engagement and radioelectronic suppression 
of air defense assets. They are precisely what give rise to the 
intensity of the conflict and the absence of compromise of 
positions of the opposing sides in that reality which had 
developed by the start of the 90s. And the reality for aviation 
is dispiriting -- the problem of its overcoming air defense is 
to this point considered unresolved, and consists of ensuring 
flight through overlapping SAM envelopes of an enormous number 
of SAM complexes and overcoming the barrier of powerful fighter 
aviation armed with long-range air-to-air missiles and capable 
of performing day or night under any weather conditions. 
Therefore, in the opinion of foreign military specialists, no 
aviation might will allow it to accomplish a single combat 
mission if the entire air defense system of the opposing side is 
not first destroyed. 
  There was no such precept in the past. Then the suppression 
of air defense assets was a secondary and even passing problem 
for aviation, but this was because such a powerful defensive 
system did not exist either. This is why aviation is forced to 
devote primary attention to the conflict with air defense, 
despite the fact that it demands the exertion of great efforts, 
reduces the power of strikes, and complicates its structuring. 
From overcoming the air defenses (a concept which suggests only 
partial suppression of the air defenses and various flanking 
maneuvers), aviation is shifting to a breakthrough of the air 
defenses, i.e., penetration to the objectives on the principle 
of "force." 
  The tactics of aviation in the breakthrough of air defenses 
consists of using specially assigned elements to combat the air 
defenses with and jamming to make "corridors" for passage of the 
assault elements to the targets. Here initially aircraft and 
drones suppress the defense from zones bordering the 
breakthrough sectors, deliver strikes jointly with air- and 
ground-launched missiles against radar posts, air defense 
command and control centers, SAM positions and fighter 
airfields, and then the assault elements proceed to their 
targets, and, in turn, jam the air defense assets from their 
battle formations. Fighters supporting the assault aviation are 
also part of the anti-air defense elements. They sweep the 
airspace on the flight paths of the assault elements, form 
barriers at approaches to the assault objectives, and their 
actions are strictly coordinated in place and time from the 
airborne command posts (AWACS). 
  At the same time, in devising the tactics of offensive 
aviation, the military leaders of the NATO air forces to 
preserve its forces strive to optimally mass their efforts and 
reduce to a minimum the time spent on delivering massed 
assaults. This is a very vital circumstance. You see, the 
shorter the duration of the assaults, the less time the fighters 
will have to repel the raids, and some of them will not even 
have time to take off from their airfields. Under the conditions 
of intensive jamming, the surviving air defense assets will not 
have time to engage all aircraft involved in the assault either. 
In addition, massed use of aviation along with drones and 
missiles may lead to an oversaturation of the air defense system 
with various aerial targets, and it will cease to cope with its 
data processing. This will also be furthered by changes in the 
disposition of aviation in massed assaults. With the adoption of 
precision weapons and new target designation equipment, the 
battle formations will consist of small elements: two or four, 
more rarely eight aircraft each. 
  A short massed assault with very high density in narrow 
breakthrough corridors, combined with heavy fire and 
radioelectronic countering action -- this according to foreign 
military experts is how the tactics of offensive aviation are 
seen in the conflict with air defense. 
  However penetration to the assault objectives on the 
principle of "force" when hundreds of planes and other aircraft 
are concentrated in the air in a limited space, and for a short 
time, is the enemy of surprise, and naturally cannot remain 
unnoticed by the opposing side. Therefore it is considered 
necessary in all cases to supplement the breakthrough of air 
defense with supporting measures to avoid the action of its 
forces and assets. 
  Avoidance of the action of air defense forces and assets 
(the 
second tendency) is based chiefly on their disinformation and 
further development of all types of maneuver. 
  Impressively large-scale disinformation measures are 
becoming 
a characteristic feature of aviation tactics. New tactical 
innovations, with the goal not of destroying or suppressing air 
defense forces and assets, but of concealing the composition, 
time, and direction of aviation assaults, are appearing more and 
more. The problem of disinformation is formulated quite simply: 
how to deceive and force the air defense system to meet aviation 
where in fact there is none. To resolve this problem, along with 
the preparation of massed assaults in the main sector, it is 
considered necessary to create groupings of assault and 
reconnaissance aircraft and drones in secondary (dummy) axes. 
With the start of massed assaults, actions against fighter 
airfields, radar posts, SAM assets are supposed to be 
implemented not only in the breakthrough corridors, but also 
over the entire line of the front and they may even be increased 
in intensity in the dummy axes. Such action procedures, foreign 
military experts believe, will force the fighter aviation to 
maneuver to reinforce the dummy axes and thus weaken its 
strength in the breakthrough sectors. 
  There is also another aspect to this problem. One need not 
possess special perspicacity to see that there is nothing easier 
than to provoke a hasty readying of forces and assets of air 
defense, premature scrambling of fighters in the periods 
preceding the delivery of massed air assaults. Simulation of a 
massed scrambling of aviation from airfields, the transmission 
of false commanders by radio, the laying down of radar 
jamming... Imagine the difficulties that a commander will have 
in estimating the situation, if these disinforming measures are 
maximally plausible, if they are conducted by the attacking 
aviation in a coordinated manner, in accordance with a 
preplanned scenario. This is why western theorists believe that 
as a result of such measures the sense of vigilance of crews at 
the command and control posts will be blunted. When the 
fighters, scrambled due to an incorrect assessment of the 
situation, having expended their fuel, are coming in for a 
landing, they will not be able to take part in the repulse of an 
initiated massed raid which will be timed for this moment. 
  And finally, this use of decoy targets will be organized in 
the disinformation measures on a large scale. This is assisted 
by the adoption into the aviation armament of qualitatively new 
EW assets. There are now an enormous number of decoy targets. 
Some of them do not have a power plant and operate for a short 
time, others are equipped with navigational apparatus, active 
jamming transmitters and automatic chaff dispensers, and may fly 
for some time along trajectories analogous to the routes of 
combat aircraft. 
  All these decoy targets can proceed along many routes 
intersecting with combat aircraft and complicate the detection 
of rear targets by the opposing side, or be used as decoys to 
draw significant fighter forces. Independent actions of decoy 
targets at the limits of detection and intercept of fighter 
aviation are possible, chiefly for disinformation of command and 
control posts. 
  Of course an increase in the specific weight of 
disinformation measures plays a negative role in complicating 
the situation for fighter aviation, but in opposing attacking 
aviation, it is also awaited by maneuvering targets. 
  What is a modern maneuvering target and what are the 
capabilities for such targets to avoid the action of fighters? 
They are small groups or single planes, cruise missiles, drones 
with active jammers, operating within the framework of the 
general disposition and concept of the attacking aviation in a 
specific range of altitudes. The more the use of precision 
weapons becomes part of its practice, the more of these targets 
will be in massed raids. Where before it was necessary to expend 
hundreds of conventional munitions, today one or several 
precision missiles are enough. Therefore the crews can operate 
while observing the principle of "each to his own target," and 
widely utilize anti-fighter and anti-air defense maneuvers. 
  Of these two basic types of maneuvers, we are interested 
chiefly in anti-fighter maneuver, which is done to avoid an 
encounter and leave the zone of possible attacks of fighters or 
to foil an aimed missile launch. No so long ago the main type of 
maneuver, known even before the Second World War, was a sharp 
turn toward the attacking fighters with maximum possible angular 
velocity. The fitting with radar sights and air-to-air guided 
missiles still did not lead to vital changes in the tactics of 
anti-fighter maneuvering in the wars in Vietnam and in the Near 
East. Missiles of that time had limited maneuver capabilities 
and short ranges and, therefore, if the attacked aircraft turned 
sharply, they would miss them. 
  However later, when more sophisticated missiles entered the 
fighter armament, allowing them to attack air targets at various 
aspect angles, from long range and secretly, maneuvers to evade 
them were vitally complicated and pervaded with new elements. 
Transition to maximal flight speed, descent to minimal 
acceptable altitude in combination with maneuver in course and 
bypassing of regions protected by patrolling fighters, these and 
other maneuvers are programmed beforehand or may be input in the 
program by the crew during the flight. There are many varieties 
of anti-fighter maneuvers. One might say there are as many as 
there are situations in air-to-air combat. It is also necessary 
to execute anti-missile maneuvers against missiles already 
launched by fighters, or in expectation of their launch 
(uncoordinated turns with significant slip, maneuvers with 
sign-variable G-forces). 
  To execute a maneuver under the new conditions, the crews 
use 
onboard equipment which warns of missile launch from fighters 
using both radar and IR guidance systems. These equipments are 
connected to jammers and IR tracers, and automatically are 
activated upon detection of a launch. If the missiles are 
"blinded," then regardless of the horizontal or vertical angle 
at which they are detected, the most advisable maneuver for the 
crews is a sharp turn at high G-forces in a direction 
perpendicular to their line of flight. 
  Consequently now the crews of attacked fighters may begin 
the 
anti-fighter maneuver long before the fighters reach visual 
contact range, and they combine an energetic defensive turn with 
the use of EW assets. 
  Here is another interesting feature. The anti-fighter 
maneuver is done in zones of antiaircraft missile and artillery 
fire of air defense assets, and cannot but be combined by the 
crews with anti-air defense maneuver, in order to avoid entering 
these zones, and in the event that they do enter them, in order 
to avoid being hit by missiles and projectiles. However in 
execution of an anti-air defense maneuver, the crews encounter a 
new situation. In continuous zones of missile and artillery 
fire, the crew's knowledge of the location of fire complexes in 
the terrain loses its importance, and when there are not 
continuous zones, highly-mobile complexes capable of delivering 
fire from short halts and on the move ensure the most timely 
information about their coordinates and evasive maneuvers 
planned in advance. Therefore, a more advisable form of maneuver 
both against missile and artillery assets and against fighters 
is considered above to be maneuver in altitude. 
  The range of maneuver altitudes in the general case may vary 
from maximally low to maximally high, but maneuver in altitude 
with subsequent transition to low altitude (fig. 33), as it was 
until recently, no longer allows aviation to achieve surprise, 
since it does not emerge from the surveillance zones of the 
AWACS aircraft, which are capable of detecting targets against 
the background of the ground. Expectation of secrecy is not 
justified. Avoiding an encounter at low altitude with fighters, 
just as engagement by numerous low-altitude SAM and artillery 
complexes, is becoming more and more difficult. Therefore, the 
need arises for further reduction in altitude, which, as 
experience of the war in Afghanistan testifies, should not 
exceed 15-20 m (height of the bottom limit of the kill zone of 
the "Stinger" missile). But here it is hard to judge what is 
more dangerous for the crews flying at high speed: destruction 
by air defense weapons or collision with the ground. After all, 
with an increase in speed the minimal safe flight altitude 
increases, maneuverability decreases, and terrain-following 
becomes impossible and, indeed, the plane itself becomes a power 
source of thermal radiation and therefore is vulnerable to 
missiles with IR guidance not only from the rear, but from the 
front hemisphere. In addition, during flight at maximally low 
altitude, it is hard, or, more precisely, impossible to search 
for mobile camouflaged targets, to use guided bombs and other 
precision weapons. So how will the crews operate in such 
situations? They are forced to go to medium altitudes, but even 
such a brief maneuver leads to loss of secrecy of actions. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-43A>      Figure 33. Maneuver in altitude to evade air defense actions. </FIG>


  In order to ensure clandestine flight at very low altitude, 
abroad they are trying to develop more sophisticated look-down 
radars, allowing the crews to adjust their direction of flight 
before reaching the objectives and to launch the missiles at 
them without changing altitude. However, development of such 
radars is still very far from perfection. It is thought more 
sensible to combine maneuver in altitude with radioelectronic 
countermeasures against the air defenses by the crews themselves 
using their onboard EW systems, with permission suppression of 
air defense installations in the flight zone. However, the 
difficult flight conditions at maximally low altitude provide, 
in the opinion of foreign military experts, an urgent need for 
the use of other altitudes as well. 
  High altitudes are inconvenient for aviation; from them it 
is 
not possible to detect and deliver assaults against small and 
mobile targets. Nonetheless, flight at these altitudes by some 
crews to avoid encountering fighter aviation, the air force 
leaders of western countries believe to be advisable. Here, due 
to the significant dimensions of the "dead zones" of radars, 
gaps are formed in the radar field created, rendering the 
vectoring of fighters more difficult. In addition the density of 
the antiaircraft fire is decreased (fig. 33). It is clear from 
the figure that although the crews enter the zones of engagement 
of the SAM complexes at any altitude, at high altitude, where 
the number and dimensions of these zones are decreased, and the 
flight speed increases, the crews cross them more quickly and 
pass above the engagement zones of the low-altitude complexes. 
  However not all foreign military specialists so 
categorically 
believe in the capabilities of the crews avoiding the action of 
present day air defenses. Is this not why a breakthrough of the 
defense, and not overcoming it, is considered decisive in the 
combat actions of aviation? Or is it that adequately effective 
variants have still not been found? 
  Penetration to the assault objectives on the principle of 
"force" or evasion of air defense actions? It would seem to be a 
strange question. Both are necessary features of the tactics of 
attacking aviation. But which of these features will take the 
primary role in the future? Under the onslaught of what sort of 
adversary will the fighters find themselves? 
  Don't wait for commentaries; there won't be any. Draw your 
own conclusions. You will be able to test them by looking at the 
further development of aviation tactics, about which we will 
speak. 
<H5>  4. A Look at the Future </H5>
  Military specialists abroad are striving to predict the 
paths 
of further development of tactics of aviation in combating 
fighter aviation. In their forecasts they allow for 
scientific-technical progress occurring in aviation, and various 
military-technical innovations which by the start of the 21st 
century might enter its armament. And those efforts which are 
undertaken in many countries of the world to develop new 
tactical technicals and recommendations to aircraft crews of the 
future become understandable. Wherein lies their fundamental 
novelty? 
  All expected offensive air weapons from the standpoint of 
tactics may be subdivided into two large groups. One of them, 
aircraft, are the platforms for new types of precision, long 
range weapons of modular design to engage various targets 
without entering the zones of engagement of the ground air 
defense forces, and even without crossing the front lines of the 
opposing side at all. This group should also include 
reconnaissance aircraft with radiotechnical reconnaissance 
equipment, air elements of reconnaissance-strike complexes, and 
AWACS planes. They all perform support tasks, operate at a long 
range from and often beyond the borders of our radar field, and 
also may provide radioelectronic countermeasures and be 
protected by air defenses. 
  The other group consists of high-speed, highly maneuverable 
aircraft with a low radar cross section and high thrust, having 
integrated EW assets and defensive weapons. This group also 
includes cruise missiles and drones of various types and for 
various purposes. They all are intended for actions over 
territory protected by air defenses. 
  In developing the tactics of each of these two groups, the 
air force leaders of the western countries attach primary 
importance to the platform aircraft of the first group, which 
use precision weapons. They predict a great future for them. 
  The crews of the platform aircraft are given the task of 
destroying the most important, well-protected objectives, and 
also participating in the break-through of the air defenses: 
assaults against SAM positions and fighter airfields in order to 
create a path to targets for the second group. 
  The crews operating outside the zones of the SAM complexes 
and at maximum range of the fighters naturally do not require 
anti-air defense maneuvers. Their tactics will boil down to 
different types of anti-fighter maneuvers which it is envisaged 
they will perform in accordance with information of AWACS 
aircraft. However these planes, which play a very important role 
in controlling aviation, themselves are primary targets for the 
actions of fighters. Of course, they patrol in engagement zones 
of the SAM complexes, and are protected by fighters and 
equipment with EW apparatus, and can detect fighters of the 
opposing side long before the latter get close to them. 
Nonetheless the crews of these planes complain of the complexity 
and unreliability of coordination with protecting assets. 
  Western specialists are concerned by the question: how to 
protect the large, poorly maneuverable AWACS from attacks by 
fighters, what tactical techniques should the crews use? 
Specialists name them quite definitely (fig. 34). Look at this 
figure. Is it not true that as you get deeper into the territory 
of the adversary in the search for an AWACS plane, you have 
something to think about? It is as simple as can be to get in 
trouble here. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-44A>      Figure 34. Tactical techniques of crews of AWACS aircraft under threat of fighter attack. </FIG>


  The tactics of combat aircraft of the second group, which 
will proceed to the assault objectives over corridors cut 
through the air defense system by missiles of the platform 
aircraft of the first group, in the opinion of foreign military 
experts, will be based chiefly on avoiding the action of the 
surviving air defenses. No, of course they will not ignore the 
losses from the engagement by these assets, but will rely more 
on planes with very low radar cross sections and weak IR 
radiation, so-called invisible (stealth) aircraft. (Fig. 35 [not 
reproduced]) 
  It is clear from the figure that these aircraft in outward 
appearance, despite the various purposes, have common features: 
they do not have large flat surfaces, breaks in their skin, or 
vertical control surfaces, and the B-2 bomber, made in the shape 
of a "flying wing," has no tail section at all. The engines and 
weapons are hidden in a well "slicked" fuselage, with air 
intakes on the top to reduce IR noticeabilty. 
  What are these strange changes that we observe in the 
designs 
of combat aircraft? Now almost all of them, developed or planned 
for development in developed capitalist countries, are built 
with the use of technical solutions aimed at reducing their 
conspicuousness, and a mass adoption of "invisible" planes in 
the aviation armament is planned. But why are conventional 
planes giving way to inconspicuous ones? They are now talking of 
these wonderful machines in full voice, and it is easy to 
explain why: the possibility of covert actions of crews over the 
territory of the opposing side, once thought impossible, has 
appeared. 
  Many military experts predict a great future for the 
"stealths." However the term "invisible" is just a metaphor. In 
fact they will not be as invisible as is thought, although they 
will be the sort of plane which is hard to detect. Therefore, 
the elation of their admirers is somewhat exaggerated. But if we 
are logical and consistent, then all this by no means appears 
depressing for the crews of these aircraft. Irony here is out of 
place. The new combat properties of the "invisibles" will 
provide scope for development also of fundamentally new tactical 
techniques. No longer maneuvers in course and speed, not able 
selection of weather conditions, and not suppression of air 
defenses, for many years proclaimed among the main principles of 
tactical techniques, but quite different components will 
determine the nature of actions of these aircraft. 
  The tactics of crews of these "invisibles" will be quite 
diverse. They may operate independently, alone or in small 
groups, or in close coordination with the crews of different 
types of aircraft. 
  In independent actions of "invisibles" the foundation of 
their tactical techniques will be the capacity of penetration to 
the assault objectives unnoticed by the air defense radars or IR 
assets. However, since it is impossible to fully eliminate the 
give-away signs of the aircraft, in order to remain undetected 
the crews must constantly maintain a specific distance from the 
detection means. Is it possible to achieve this in a continuous 
radar field of the opposing side? American military experts 
developing the new technologies of "invisible" aircraft answer 
this question in the affirmative. They assume that crews having 
data on the location of the most dangerous radars and possessing 
high professional proficiency, will be able to ensure, if not 
full secrecy of flight, then at least later detection by air 
defenses, not leaving time to the SAM complexes and fighters to 
engage and intercept. 
  For a reduction in the time spent in the surveillance and 
engagement envelopes of the air defenses, strict limitations in 
the use of airborne radars and other radiating electronics, and 
almost complete radio silence throughout the entire combat 
flight, as well as the use of EW assets, are envisaged. The 
crews of the "invisibles" much more easily than other aircraft 
can camouflage their weak signs or create blips of decoy targets 
of low intensity on the scopes of fighters and radars of SAM 
complexes. As for the flight altitudes, it is advisable for them 
to be medium and high altitudes, more convenient for 
accomplishment of combat missions. In addition low-altitude 
flight, requiring continuous operation of terrain-following 
radar, especially at night and in difficult weather conditions, 
may strongly betray the "invisibles." 
  In coordination with aircraft of other types, the 
"invisibles" may support their combat actions, first penetrating 
enemy territory to suppress his air defenses and search for 
objectives. Another version is also possible, which conventional 
planes with long-distance missiles will be the first to deliver 
an assault on air defense installations without entering their 
engagement zones. Then the "invisibles" (B-2 bombers) as it were 
in a second wave will enter the corridor formed to engage mobile 
missile complexes, enterprises of the military industry, and 
other remote objectives. But in all variants the routes of the 
flights, the time of approach and passage of the lines and zones 
of air defense will be carefully coordinated and combined with 
various disinformation measures. 
  The tactics of the crews of other combat aircraft which do 
not have low radar cross sections to an even greater degree than 
for the "invisibles" will be directed toward disinformation of 
the entire defense system. In this they will be assisted by the 
onboard equipment, ensuring continuous maneuvering of the planes 
in automatic mode, flight along the route with hard-to-predict 
changes in course, and more sophisticated EW assets. In 
assessing the possibilities of universal highly automated EW 
complexes with programmed control and comparing them with the 
interference resistance of the command and control posts and 
onboard systems of the fighters, some foreign experts smile 
ironically: the radioelectronic situation for the opposing side 
will be so complex that the success of the attacking aviation is 
beyond doubt. 
  But is that so? The expected complication of the situation 
may lead to a vital reduction in the effectiveness of combat 
actions of the fighter aviation, but only in the case that 
further development of defense ceases. However, such stagnation 
has never been observed in the history of the opposition of the 
means of defense and attack. In each previous turn of the 
dialectical spiral, the development of fighter tactics has 
followed the tactics of offensive aviation. So a one-sided 
prediction with the accent on the development of only one side 
holds the danger of great error. 
  Let us try at least in general outline to prove the 
rightness 
of this precept and to sketch the contours of the further 
confrontation. This situation is greatly brightened by the 
development of the EW assets of the opposing side. Foreign 
military specialists place great hopes on the mono-pulse radar, 
allowing the fighter command and control centers to obtain 
information about the range and direction of the targets to be 
intercepted using only one pulse. They assume that serious 
difficulties will arise for the attacking aviation with 
expansion of the waveband of the new radars from the millimeter 
to the long waves, and with the development and use by the crews 
of technical techniques such as rapid change in the shape of 
pulses, retuning of the frequency from pulse to pulse. 
  In the capacity of retaliatory measures to the strengthening 
of radioelectronic countermeasures of aviation, the possibility 
is considered of creating air defense radar systems in which the 
transmitting and receiving antennas are widely separated from 
one another. Without an idea where the receiver is located, the 
crews of the planes may jam only in the direction of the 
transmitter, while the receiver will be unaffected by jamming. 
But an ever more insidious threat to aviation is created by a 
wide network of passive assets for the detection and tracking of 
air targets, which it will be impossible not only to suppress, 
but even to detect. And what about weapons systems on the 
fighters with combined guidance (radar, infrared, electro-optic, 
laser)? After all, all of these systems must be suppressed 
simultaneously and immediately! It turns out that the outcome of 
the confrontation becomes quite problematic, just like the paths 
of development of the very tactics of offensive aviation. 
  However, aviation will have yet another "trump card" -- the 
cruise missiles of tomorrow, precision, long and medium range, 
with different warheads (dispenser, armor-piercing, 
concrete-piercing). Although according to the treaty between the 
USSR and the U.S., ground-based cruise missiles have been 
eliminated, air- and sea-launched cruise missiles remain, and 
this certainly does not make things easier for fighters. 
  Pilots will be in a difficult situation when intercepting 
cruise missiles launched many hundreds of kilometers away from 
the protected installations, missiles moving at high, supersonic 
speed, maneuvering in accordance with a program for searching 
for the given targets and evading the attacks of fighters. How 
can such missiles be attacked, which automatically select the 
optimal flight trajectory, go around obstacles in their path to 
the target, and even have reduced levels of give-away signs? At 
the same time, judging from the development of cruise missiles 
being conducted abroad, the effectiveness of their assaults will 
become so great that any assumption of intercept is obviously 
unacceptable. Plans are to mount infrared and optical 
instruments, connected to a system for matching the contrast 
contours of observed objects and those entered in memory. 
Systems are being developed for autonomous (from on board the 
missile) evaluations of the degree of destruction of the 
objects, retargeting the missiles at surviving elements and 
delivering munitions to the targets at an aspect angle most 
effective for their destruction. (FLIGHT, 1988, No. 4132.) 
  Of course, a few paragraphs about the cruise missiles of the 
future is only a concentrate of information, and indeed not a 
complete one. For the time being, arguments about new approaches 
to the tactics of fighters in combatting cruise missiles remain 
just as incomplete. In order that I not repeat myself, I 
recommend that the reader turn to chapter II and look again at 
the capabilities of future fighters. 
  So how does the onslaught of the air adversary, armed with 
super-modern equipment, appear? How does he intend to use all 
these military technical novelties in the fight with fighter 
aviation, considering that the latter, too, continues to be 
improved? There is a constant discussion of opinions, ideas, 
views regarding questions of further confrontation of offensive 
and fighter aviation. Much is still unclear. Will not fighter 
aviation be confronted by other conditions of combat action, 
today unknown, by the start of the coming era? This is the key 
question of the problem. It is answered in different ways, and 
this is a true sign that the problem is still not resolved. But 
here we enter the shaky ground of suppositions, and will not be 
hasty in our forecasts. Clearly, even if resolved in the 
technical context, a problem will still long await its technical 
solutions. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The process of confrontation of tactics of the opposing 
sides, occurring in close relation and mutual causation, is a 
natural and continuous one. Here any of the directions of such 
confrontation begins with the appearance or advent of offensive 
weapons. Naturally the creation of defensive assets without some 
information about the offensive weapons is practically 
impossible. The advent of more powerful aviation not only makes 
conditions difficult for fighter aviation, but also reveals to 
it new ways to resolve problems, provokes the need to seek out 
and develop more effective equipment and tactics, and the 
development of fighter aviation and air defense as a whole 
engenders new techniques and tactics of aviation. And this 
bilateral process will not end as long as aviation and air 
defenses exist. 
<H5>  Chapter IV. Mysteries of Interaction with Ground Air Defenses </H5>
  From the start of its creation, air defense was structured 
and developed as an integrated system, including different types 
of forces and assets capable through their joint efforts of 
repelling enemy air raids. And from the very start this system 
included fighter aviation, which conducted the battle with the 
air adversary in close interaction with the ground air defense 
assets. And now I should reveal a secret. It should be 
acknowledged that this interaction is not all that close. It 
holds many mysteries, contradictions, and prejudices which are 
not easy to figure out. But are things as bad as all that? 
Before we delve into the causes of this, unfortunately we must 
make another excursion into history. "Unfortunately" because 
this question is by no means raised for the first time. 
<H5>  1. Who Gets Priority? </H5>
  At the air defense command post, the combat alert signal was 
sounded. A large group of bombers was approaching the protected 
installation. First the fighters were inserted into the battle 
to repel the raid. They bravely attacked the enemy. But the AA 
gunners were awaiting a favorable moment to open fire, and 
watched the air battle carefully -- they did not want to hit 
their own pilots! But then the AA artillery opened fire. Now the 
fighters kept away from the fire bursts, and the bombers 
meanwhile had already entered their target run... 
  Such a picture was a not uncommon sight at the start of the 
Great Patriotic War. At that time the air defense had determined 
two active assets, the fighter aviation and the antiaircraft 
artillery. Their combat actions were supported by air 
observation posts, which detected the adversary visually and 
from the sound of his motors using optical and acoustic 
instruments (binoculars, range finders, and sound rangers). The 
fighters were supposed to join battle first, and after them the 
antiaircraft guns of various calibers, and machineguns located 
close to and within the objective, would open fire. And the 
service for warning of the air adversary? How did it warn the 
fighter aviation and AA artillery? The short range of visual and 
optical detection of targets reduced to naught the aspiration of 
the fighters to intercept the adversary at remote approaches to 
the protected facilities. The fundamental defects in the 
acoustic instruments, which also had short range of operation 
and accuracy in determining the target coordinates, also had 
their effect. Too little time remained for their interception 
after the noise of the motors had reached the sound rangers. 
Under conditions of poor visibility, binoculars and optical 
range finders were of little use. 
  The literature of the fatherland reported, not without 
pride: 
first experimental units for radio detection of planes was 
developed in our country in 1934. (See: M.M. Lobanov. Razvitiye 
sovetskoy radiolokatsionnoy tekhniki. (Development of Soviet 
Radar Technology). M.: Voyenizdat, 1982, p. 21.) And what of it? 
A whole seven years later, radars, and only six experimental 
models, type RUS-2, existed only in the national air defense 
forces (See: Voyska protivovoxdusnoy oborony strany v Velikoy 
Otechestvennoy voyne. (National Air Defense Forces in the Great 
Patriotic War), vol. 1, M.: voyenizdat, 1954, p. 67.) How can we 
not recall here that our future ally England back in 1940 was 
able to create a coherent air defense warning system (based on 
38 radars) and, fighting one-on-one with the German Luftwaffe, 
won the battle. (Ibid, p. 42). 
  The war immediately demonstrated the increased role of air 
defense and the improvement of interaction with its forces and 
assets. Although overall they constitute an impressive force, a 
classical scheme, developed before the start of the war and 
envisaging a consistent and organized commitment of air defense 
assets to battle was not developed. 
  Of course the conditions of the war's inception most 
unfavorably affected the organization and implementation of 
interaction. These have already been mentioned in preceding 
chapters, but there were also other causes here. Air defense 
forces interacting with fighter aviation were not fully equipped 
with artillery guns, did not have sufficient ammunition, and 
measures to form, arm, and deploy the subunits and units of AA 
artillery were not concluded. The forces and assets of national 
air defense, few in number, without a unified command, were 
grouped to defend individual major points in the threatened 
regions. Such a defense was very much a point-of-resistance 
defense, did not have adequate depth and was not able to repel 
massed strikes of bombers, which in addition were accompanied by 
active suppression of air defenses. 
  Under such conditions, how could the coordination of fighter 
aviation and antiaircraft artillery be organized? By day the 
initiative in selection of targets was usually left to the 
fighters. They attacked the adversary at high altitude, where 
the AA fire was less effective, and also at other altitudes. The 
AA gunners followed the progress of the battle, and when the 
pilots entered their fire zones, they conducted "blank fire," 
i.e., they tracked the targets, observing them through their 
sights. Sometimes the gunners themselves helped the fighters 
with target designation by laying down check points with special 
rounds, which created a cloud of colored smoke. Fire was 
commenced only after the pilots exited the battle. 
  At night the fighters repelled the raids of bombers in zones 
which were organized in illuminated searchlight fields, or 
conducted visual search for aircraft against the background of 
the moon, the bright side of the horizon, or from the flame from 
the exhaust pipes of the motors. During enemy attacks in 
engagement zones of the AA artillery, the pilots issued agreed 
signals "I am attacking" with colored flares, but these signals 
were hard to make out from the ground, greatly tied down the 
gunners, and often led to the engagement of friendly planes or 
to the AA artillery generally ceasing to fire. 
  The AA artillery could deliver fire only on targets 
illuminated by the searchlights, or ineffective barrage fire. 
However the searchlights, having a short range of illumination 
of targets (7-8 km) and obtaining very imprecise data from sound 
rangers, also proved to be far from the best means. They groped 
long and impotently in the sky in search of enemy planes, and 
could support the actions of the fighter aviation and AA 
artillery only in cloudless weather, and only in a small region. 
  All these mix-ups and contradictions clearly did not fit any 
frameworks of the theory of interaction developed on the eve of 
the war. 
  In order to find a way out of the critical situation, in 
which the coordinating forces and assets found themselves, 
required exceptional efforts of the military leadership, 
industry, and all personnel, but first of all a sharp increase 
in the combat capabilities of AA artillery. Soon the situation 
began to markedly change for the better. 
  In the troop air defense forces they began to form strong AA 
artillery groups. By the end of 1942 they were already able to 
support the massing of forces and assets of AA artillery and to 
create zones of dense, multi-layered fire over the main troop 
groupings. Thanks to the creation of large artillery groupings, 
the troops received a reliable "umbrella" over their heads, and 
losses to fascist aviation grew sharply. In the first year of 
the war, AA artillery destroyed an average of about 300 enemy 
planes a month, and in the second half of 1942, more than 400. 
(Central Archive of the Ministry of Defense (TsAMO) F. 36, op. 
12552, d. 10, l. 67-69.) 
  Subsequently the AA defense became more and more powerful. 
To 
protect the troops operating in main axes, they were reinforced 
with a larger and larger quantity of AA artillery units and 
formations. For example, in the Yassko-Kisinev operation, the 
6th Tank Army alone had an AA artillery group consisting of an 
AA artillery division and three separate AA artillery regiments. 
(See: Voyenno-istoricheskiy zhurnal, 1962, No. 1) 
  With the increased capabilities of the AA weapons, the 
fighters began to interact with them by separating the regions 
of the battle, i.e., by intercepting the adversary at the 
approaches to the protected troops, coordinating its actions 
with the AA gunners, and they with their fire separated the 
enemy fighters from our planes at critical moments of the 
air-to-air battle. For coordination of joint actions sorties of 
fighters were reported to the CPs of the AA units, and air 
representatives were sent to them. 
  In the national air defense forces, they also conducted 
serious organizational transformations. These boiled down to a 
quantitative strengthening of forces and assets, creation of 
extensive air defense zones, the forward lines of which were 
200-250 km from the main protected installations. The zone of 
action of the air defense covered the airspace over the defended 
installations and at the near approaches to them. The fighter 
aviation as the most long-range weapon was committed to the 
battle at the far approaches and concentrated its efforts in the 
most dangerous axes, but if necessary operated in the zone of 
the AA artillery. But the main thing was that the fighter 
aviation began to be successfully used in the interest of 
protecting not one but several installations. Large groups and 
assets of air defense were concentrated to defend the most 
important rear installations. 
  Thus in the defense of Moscow alone, just from the 1st Air 
Defense Corps and the 6th Fighter Aviation Corps operationally 
subordinate to it, 600-700 fighters, 600-800 medium AA guns and 
170-350 low-caliber guns, 170-650 high caliber AA machineguns, 
and 700-760 AA searchlights participated in the repulse of 
massed strikes of fascist aviation. (TsAMO, f. 72, op. 12274, d. 
59, l. 1; d.7, l. 18; d. 49, l. 45.) A great leap in the 
development of air defense was the adoption of radars which were 
produced by industry in a mobile ("Redut") and fixed 
("Pegmatit") variant, the number of which by the end of 1943 had 
reached 200. (Ibid, f. 81, op. 12204, d. 453, l. 4) While before 
the air defense could detect and destroy only visible planes, 
and behind clouds they were betrayed by the sound of their 
motors, now neither clouds nor darkness hampered the battle with 
them. Despite the technical imperfection, even the first models 
of radars make it possible at once to improve by a factor of 
8-10 the range of detection of the planes, determine their 
coordinates almost instantaneously, and know the air situation 
over quite wide regions. 
  Based on radars, dense radar fields and fighter guidance 
centers were organized. The incidence of radar guidance 
increased in 1942 from 17 to 46 percent. (Ibid, op. 94592, d. 
29, l. 55.) Now fighter aviation repulsed air raids jointly with 
other ground assets of air defense, which had also experienced a 
qualitative leap: anti-aircraft artillery, which had radar 
gunsights, and radar searchlights (visual searchlights combined 
with radar) which illuminated the aircraft suddenly without a 
preliminary search -- "with the shot." 
  The conditions of interaction of fighter aviation and 
antiaircraft artillery also improved. This was implemented in 
two ways: by distribution of efforts over zones of combat action 
and by joint destruction of enemy planes in the zones of AA 
fire. Here preference was given to the former, simpler, method, 
when fighter aviation and AA artillery operated without 
hampering one another. But during interaction in a single zone, 
priority continued to be given to the fighters. 
  By the end of the war Soviet air defense, extending for many 
hundreds of kilometers, and saturated with a net of airfields, 
observation and guidance posts, and AA positions, became more 
powerful and more impenetrable for the enemy. Its manpower and 
assets were echeloned to an ever-increasing depth from the 
defended objects, and further concentration of AA artillery in 
the most important of them continued. Fighter aviation, 
interacting with AA artillery in zones of combat action, 
successfully protected objects in the territory liberated from 
the enemy. Thanks to its maneuverability and offensive nature of 
actions, it remains the basis strike force for air defense 
throughout the war in interaction with AA artillery. 
  However, interaction at night still left something to be 
desired. The Germans were using night fighters as much as they 
could -- the two-engine Me-110 planes with onboard radars and 
strengthened cannon (in the Berlin AD system alone the number 
had reached three squadrons by 1944). (F. Reuter. Funkmess 
Opladen, 1971, p. 122.) -- and our fighters interacted with AA 
artillery only in visual searchlight fields, or looked for the 
enemy from the flames of his exhaust pipes. 
  Now, jumping ahead mentally some one-and-a-half decades, 
let's look again at the AD command post. 
<H5>  2. Gains and Losses </H5>
  ...Slowly the mighty radars move their latticed, delicate 
antennas, searching the air space. The silver arrows of the SAMs 
are frozen in readiness to launch, the all-weather fighters on 
the gray concrete are ready to scramble. The Great Patriotic War 
never knew such weapons of the national air defense forces. 
  In the ground forces, the rifled ZZ artillery has gradually 
given way to the SAMs. Possessing different capabilities than AA 
artillery in terms of range and accuracy in striking targets 
over a broad range of altitudes and flight speeds, they could 
destroy the air adversary not only over protected forces, but 
also at the far approaches to them. A ramified net of mobile 
radars provided continuous tracking of the air situation over 
broad territories. 
  The systems of troop and national air defense forces were 
created as a unified whole on the basis of mixed elements of SAM 
and AA artillery units and subunits, which are deployed ahead of 
time to protect objects, have a stable character, and elements 
of fighter aviation. As the most maneuverable AD resource, it 
was not assigned to individual objects, but was supposed to act 
at the boundaries of the whole defended region and mass efforts 
in decisive axes. 
  All this rich arsenal of new AD weapons and their principles 
of formation, in combination with guidance systems which ensured 
coordination of efforts of interacting forces, their warning and 
target designation, radically strengthened the might of defense, 
and created the capability of protecting whole regions and axes. 
The interacting manpower and resources of air defense also 
became capable of tasks which earlier could not be dreamed of. 
But then, let us not create illusions. 
  It would seem from common sense that the effectiveness of 
joint actions of fighters and SAM weapons should increase at 
least in proportion to their combat might. However this did not 
occur. This supposition, at first glance indisputable, is 
erroneous. This phenomenon became a riddle, but where was the 
explanation? Here one other problem was also noted: securing the 
safety of the fighters, and eliminating cases when they were 
engaged by SAMs, proved to be a very complex task, and this led 
to very fateful consequences. With entry of the fighters into 
the kill zones of the SAM complexes, their freedom of action was 
constrained, and great limitations were imposed on fire maneuver 
of the SAM complexes, so that the overall result was less than 
the sum of the results achieved by each system separately. 
  A strange situation arose: the gains in combat might of air 
defense turned out to be losses. And then one "side of the scale 
of interaction" -- the growth of combat capabilities of AD 
weapons, overflowed, and the counterweight proved to be entirely 
inadequate: joint actions interfered with utilizing them fully. 
And indeed, let us compare: high-altitude, rapid-fire, 
jamming-resistent SAM complexes, and supersonic all-weather 
fighters with powerful weapons, limiting the capabilities of one 
another... 
  Years went by, and the range of fire of the SAM complexes 
grew, and the forward edge of the zone of combat actions of SAM 
assets extended further and further from the defended objects, 
crowding out the fighters. However much in the organization of 
interaction remained as before. The fighter aviation was 
assigned the battle with aviation at the far perimeters, beyond 
the limits of the kill zones of the SAM complexes, and the SAM 
complexes had the job at the close approaches and directly over 
the objects. Each AD asset independently operated in its own 
zone, not interfering with the other, or ... the attacking 
aviation, from consistently overcoming first the resistance of 
the fighter aviation, and then that of the SAM assets. 
  Thus after giving an initial impetus to joint actions, this 
impetus ceased to function. In AD systems a significant gap 
appeared in place and time of the fire influence on the 
adversary. What is more, this gab, or "neutral zone," kept 
expanding. 
  But enough of abstraction and speculative estimates. Let us 
pose the question specifically: what are the dimensions of this 
"neutral zone"? In order to eliminate engagement of friendly 
fighters by SAM complexes, they must be pulled from the battle 
at a distance from the forward edge of the kill zone of the SAM 
complexes equal to 
  Sv = Ri + Vi (tk + tz), 
  where: Ri is the turning radius of the fighters when they 
pull out of the battle; 
  Vi is the fight speed of the fighters; 
  tk is the time of issuance and travel of the order to pull 
out of the battle; 
  tz is the delay time of the pilots in executing the order. 
  Simple calculation allows the reader to obtain the specific 
dimensions of the air space where the adversary is not 
influenced, but even without doing the calculation, just by 
glancing at the formula it is obvious that all of its components 
depend on the flight speed of the fighters, and this, alas, does 
not have a tendency to decrease. 
  At the same time, this seemingly simple formula of 
interaction is very complex from the standpoint of its tactical 
realization. First of all, the SAM element includes complexes 
for various purposes with different ranges of fire, which in 
turn are determined by the altitude of the targets. Second, in 
order to destroy targets within the limits of the whole depth of 
the kill zone of the SAM complex, the distribution of targets 
and the issuance of target designations to the SAM crews must be 
done at the more remote perimeters, whose location will also 
depend on the flight speed of the targets. And third, the 
spatial dimensions both of the SAM kill zones and of the 
air-to-air battles of the fighters have continued to increase, 
especially if they are moved to the forward hemisphere of the 
targets. But for actions in a single zone (the zone of SAM 
fired) the danger of an erroneous engagement of friendly 
fighters has continued. 
  The further refitting of AD systems with more sophisticated 
SAM complexes, the tightening of their network, and the growth 
of fire power have made the presence of fighters in their zones 
more and more hazardous, and then the command was faced with a 
dilemma: SAM complexes or fighters? 
  And indeed, identifying aircraft in the air at long range, 
quickly and correctly determining who is friend, who foe, under 
conditions which rule out a visual assessment of the external 
distinguishing marks, has become very difficult for the crews of 
SAM complexes. And their elements have increasingly expanded and 
deployed in such a way that continuous zones of missile fire 
were formed over large territories. Therefore, for fighter 
aviation there simply remained no free air space which could not 
come under the fire of SAM complexes. 
  Experience of local wars showed that if the fighters were 
forced to operate in the same zone with them, then SAM fire 
would shoot down friendly aircraft, as happened in the 
Arab-Israeli War of 1973. (International Defense Review, 1974, 
No. 3.) 
  Where, there, were the fighters to operate, if their safety 
in the zones of SAM fire was not guaranteed? Only at the far 
approaches to the defended objects, or in the rear, which from 
the tactical standpoint was not very advantageous? And how to 
intercept low-flying targets if the lines of commitment of the 
fighters to battle could not be extended beyond the limits of 
the SAM kill zones? Puzzles, puzzles... But after all, it had 
long been known that a chain cannot be stronger than its weakest 
link, and fighter aviation became this link. The gain of SAM 
assets led to a loss in its combat capabilities. 
  It cannot be said that this situation, which had acquired 
for 
the fighters an increasingly negative coloration, was all that 
unexpected. It had developed gradually, and the ground AD assets 
did not become so diverse overnight, from the mighty 
multi-channel complexes, which could engage several targets 
simultaneously, to the single missile on a soldier's shoulder, 
with no warning of the approach of an air adversary. But equally 
gradually the role and place of fighter aviation in the AD 
systems changed, as we shall see. 
<H5>  3. The Role and Place of Fighter Aviation in AD Systems </H5>
  The role and place of fighter aviation in AD systems, 
western 
theorists believe, are determined by the specific features of 
the military-geographic situation, the political and economic 
importance of the specific regions and objectives, the combat 
properties and capabilities of the fighters and other manpower 
and resources making up the air defense. Economic factors and 
the level of development of each country have a significant 
influence on the role and place of fighter aviation. In studying 
this question, western theorists concluded that the changes in 
these factors, especially the combat capabilities of the 
fighters and SAM complexes, which developed at far from the same 
rates, from time to time provoke an overestimate of their role 
and place in AD systems. 
  From the history of development of air defense it is clear 
that the amplitude of such changes has proven quite wide, from 
acknowledgement of fighter aviation as the chief means of air 
defense to its complete negation. During the Second World War 
and in subsequent wars until the advent of SAM complexes, 
fighters played a decisive role and comprised the foundation of 
air defense of many countries. AA artillery was in second place, 
although its effectiveness was improving constantly. Thus while 
in the First World War AA artillery of all warring countries 
accounted for about 15 to 20 percent of downed aircraft, in the 
Second World War it was already 40 percent. (ANTIAIRCRAFT 
JOURNAL, 1949, No. 11) 
  The SAM weapons which were supplanting the AA artillery 
first 
were used only to reinforce the fighter aviation. Then their 
role quickly grew. Thus in the local wars in Vietnam and in the 
Near East they destroyed (along with AA artillery) around 90 
percent of all downed air targets. (INTERNATIONAL DEFENSE 
REVIEW, 1973, No 12). Such high effectiveness of actions of the 
SAM complexes led to a reassessment of the role and place of 
fighter aviation in air defense systems. In the West new 
theories of organization of air defense began to appear, in 
which fighters were assigned a more than modest place. It was 
proposed that they be used only for protecting secondary regions 
unprotected by SAM complexes. Thus the French Army General A. 
Bofre stated: "Be that as it may, now it is clear that aviation 
can no longer play a decisive role in air defense of objects, 
when the latter are provided with strong missile protection." 
(FORCE ARMEE FRANCAISE, 1964, No. 18) Many agreed with him, 
believing that SAM complexes were capable of solving practically 
all problems of air defense, and that they should assume a 
monopoly status in it. However, the opinions of other military 
theorists were not so categorical, and "anti-fighter" views and 
theories did not live long. Subsequently they were revised in 
the direction of a balanced development of SAM complexes and 
fighters, but still the role of aviation had diminished to some 
extent. In particular, as the foreign press reported, the number 
of fighters in the U.S. air defense system by the start of the 
seventies had decreased by nearly two thirds in comparison with 
1965. In the FRG, of four fighter squadrons only two remained. 
Only the English command had stuck to its former views, 
asserting that the air defense of Great Britain was based on the 
use of fighter interceptors as long as the opposing side had 
strike aircraft in its armament. (AIR FORCES, 1972, No. 11.) 
  The experience of local wars refuted the pessimism of the 
extinction of fighter aviation. It was found that SAM complexes 
and fighters had their own specific fields of application, where 
they could be used with the greatest success and, therefore, 
that they did not exclude but complemented one another. In the 
early 70s in the NATO countries the concept was adopted for 
their joint use. Here the priority use of fighter aviation was 
envisaged beyond the zones of SAM fire, and at ranges far from 
the defended objects. 
  Even today military leaders in different countries do not 
agree in their assessment of the role and place of fighter 
aviation in the air defense system. At times the differences and 
polarity have been great. At one pole are the adherents of SAM 
weapons. Comparing the characteristics of fighters and SAMs, 
they argue that the time spent on closing with targets flying at 
supersonic speed for fighters even with the highest readiness to 
scramble (30 seconds) is almost twice as long as for SAMs. 
Therefore in order to achieve the same effectiveness of combat 
actions of fighter aviation, a significantly longer range of 
target detection is required than for SAM complexes. Noting the 
high accuracy, rate of fire, and operational reliability of SAM 
complexes, some foreign theorists believe that the dominant role 
in combatting the aerial adversary has forever shifted from the 
fighters to SAM systems. The views of these theorists have found 
support in some countries, where SAM complexes now occupy the 
leading role. 
  At the other pole are the proponents of fighter aviation, 
who 
propose that although SAM weapons do have a higher level of 
combat readiness and other advantages, they are not capable of 
fighting a large number of enemy planes, operating in high 
densities, without fighters. Besides, SAM complexes have 
limitations in range of fire, and their missiles with respect to 
G forces. They are still not effective enough in combatting 
energetically maneuvering planes. Therefore the probability of a 
kill against such targets in comparison with maneuvering ones 
diminishes markedly, and generally is below the rated 
probability. In their opinion fighter aviation is more mobile 
and to a significant extent is free of these defects. The 
tactics of fighters are more flexible and allow their action in 
any region over a broad range of altitudes, in a rapidly 
changing air situation and enemy tactics. In this sense the 
elements of SAM air defense complexes are in the worse position. 
They have less mobility and cannot quickly elude a strike, since 
tearing down their battle formations, relocating to a new 
region, and subsequent setup require a significant amount of 
time, which sometimes exceeds the total duration of the enemy 
raid. 
  Proponents of fighter aviation believe that in contrast to 
SAM complexes it possesses adequate capabilities for maneuver of 
long range. Only through the use of fighters is it possible to 
quickly concentrate efforts of air defense in the axis of the 
main enemy strike, ensure protection of the flanks of friendly 
forces, and to close a breech formed in the air defense system 
for some time. Among the advantages which fighters have over 
SAMs they cite the capability of the fighters to monitor greater 
volumes of air space, and more reliably determine the national 
affiliation of the targets. Therefore to assert that SAM weapons 
are the high road of development of air defense is at the least 
still premature. 
  Foreign specialists stress that our desires to the contrary, 
the initiative in selection of time and place of strikes belongs 
to the adversary. He will penetrate the AD system where it is 
advantageous to him, i.e., in the axes which are most weakly 
protected by SAMs, at narrow sectors of the front. But this 
means that the air defence manpower and assets will be forced to 
operate under conditions of a very uncertain situation, that 
only that portion of the SAM complexes will participate in the 
repulse of the raids who are in the breakthrough zone. In this 
situation, only fighter aviation can execute a fast maneuver, 
concentrating its forces in the threat axis, and thus compensate 
for errors in predicting the possible actions of the adversary. 
  The controversy between adversaries and proponents of 
fighter 
aviation is still not over. Western specialists are not all that 
confident in placing an equal sign between fighters and SAM 
complexes. They vacillate on who should be given the preference 
under various conditions of the situation. However the 
controversy in no case is about a monopoly, mutually exclusive 
use of SAMs or fighters. In their studies and recommendations, 
foreign theorists are unanimous in asserting that air defense 
must be organized as a unified system containing both SAM 
complexes and fighters. 
  As was already mentioned above, depending on the geographic 
situation and other factors, these questions may be resolved in 
different ways. Thus the U.S. and Canada have made 
fighter-interceptors the foundation of their air defenses. They 
have been assigned to protect the most important 
administrative-political centers, command and control organs, 
air and sea lines of communication against air strikes. But in 
the European countries of NATO these tasks as a rule are 
distributed between air defense aviation and SAM units. 
  At present all NATO countries are paying close attention to 
raising the combat capabilities both of SAM complexes and of 
fighters, a factor which among others determines their role and 
place in air defense systems. 
  One could spend some time enumerating the new modes of 
aviation and missile equipment. Let us stipulate at the outset 
that we shall not try to "break them down to the fine details," 
for they are too diverse. Besides, many of them are very 
short-lived, and merge with others, change their direction, and 
indeed this book is not a reference. Therefore it is best for 
the reader to acquaint himself with specific characteristics of 
the SAM complexes and fighters under development from other 
sources. We shall limit ourselves only to a description of the 
general trends of their development, and assess how they 
influence the role and place of fighter aviation. 
  In the opinion of foreign military specialists, among the 
basic trends of development of SAM missile weapons one can note 
an increase in their fire power and accuracy, an increase in the 
range of the SAM, and a reduction in the time required to 
commence fire. Linked to systems of long-range radar detection, 
these complexes will have high-speed missiles with better 
maneuverability and combined guidance systems. Such SAM 
complexes are augmented by close-in systems with television, IR 
and laser sights. At the same time, the capabilities both of 
mobile all-weather SAM missile and artillery complexes to engage 
high-speed aircraft and missiles, and in fire maneuver without 
change of fire positions, are also increasing. Deployed in troop 
battle formations and possessing high fire productivity, they 
are used in various combinations; the missiles and guns may also 
be deployed on the same transport. (INTERAVIA, 1985, No. 11; 
1986, No. 12) 
  How do things stand with regard to an increase in combat 
capabilities of fighter aviation? The foreign press notes that 
it is occurring chiefly through replacement of outmoded aircraft 
with more sophisticated ones, and also through stage-by-stage 
modernization of the fighters now in the air defense armament. 
There is no need to turn to the characteristics of the 
prospective craft, with which the reader was acquainted in 
chapter II; one need only supplement them with the requirements 
imposed on "pure" air defense fighters: assurance of intercept 
of attacking aviation at more remote perimeters, increase in the 
capabilities of detection of small targets (cruise missiles), 
and also rapid scramble on alert. Undoubtedly, with a sharp 
increase in the capabilities of fighter aviation, its place and 
role in organization of air defense will also increase. This 
becomes all the more evident in light of the statements of some 
western experts, who try to look into the future of defense. 
  They assume that the latest models of modern AD complexes 
will probably remain effective for some time, but by the end of 
the century they will not be able to repulse air raids with an 
increase in their density, or destruction of high-speed missiles 
maneuvering with high G forces. Despite the further improvement 
in characteristics, the range of complexes will still prove to 
be inadequate to protect objects at remote approaches, and they 
themselves will remain vulnerable to precision weapons. 
(INTERAVIA. 1984, No. 2; AVIATION WEEK 1986, No. 7) 
  This is why in the development and improvement of AD 
systems, 
one starts with the fact that no type of weapon created to this 
point can ensure reliable protection of friendly objects from 
all the offensive air weapons at the enemy's disposal. To 
accomplish this task it is necessary to have a precisely 
organized interaction of different types of weapons within the 
framework of a uniform air defense system. At the same time, 
joint actions of fighters and SAM complexes continue to impose 
some restrictions on the combat capabilities of each of them, 
especially when the state affiliation of the targets is 
determined not on the approach to the intercept lines, but on 
the ground from their fragments. Therefore the contradiction 
between the growing might of air defense weapons and their 
capability of joint actions continues to develop, and the 
problem will not find its solution. 
  Of course it would be illogical to abandon interaction in 
one 
zone, say foreign military specialists. But how are we to 
combine the efforts of fighters and antiaircraft weapons, how 
can we eliminate their mutual limitations? To resolve this 
problem newer and newer attempts are made, and technical and 
organizational measures are undertaken. In particular, work is 
done to improve systems of airspace monitoring in order to 
ensure a more detailed depiction of the situation at command 
posts, new methods are being developed for optimal distribution 
of forces against targets, for each weapon altitudes and times 
are established when it can be used without limitation, but the 
problem remains unresolved. 
  Meanwhile foreign experts note that the processes of the 
battle by fighters and SAM complexes with the air adversary are 
becoming more and more similar. Thus the targets are detected by 
radars of the guidance centers of the fighter aviation, and by 
the reconnaissance and target designation radars of SAM 
complexes at long range, and identified with "IFF" devices. Then 
a target designation is issued to the fighters and to the 
missile guidance centers, the targets are automatically traced 
by the pilots or by the SAM crews, and after entry into the kill 
zone of the air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, are 
destroyed. The only difference is that the fighters close 
quickly with the adversary and must obtain a target designation 
from the ground or airborne command post, while the SAM 
complexes stay in the same place and have their own target 
designation assets. 
  Consequently there is some unity developing in the battles 
fought by fighters and by SAM subunits, and as a consequence 
wider capabilities have developed for organization of their 
joint actions. Thus the tactics of fighter aviation in air 
defense systems continue to be the tactics of a joint battle 
waged in accordance with a uniform concept, in which two 
sub-systems must complement one another. 
  Here is something to think about both for the fighters and 
for the SAM crews. Interaction between them should keep pace 
with the development of aviation and missile equipment, allow 
for changes in enemy tactics, and undoubtedly assure complete 
realization of their combat capabilities. 
  Today the variants of joint battle are diverse. The fighters 
may conduct an independent search in earlier-assigned regions 
and meet the adversary before his approach to the SAM kill 
zones. It is necessary to reduce the density of the raid and 
scatter the battle formations of large groups, and then it will 
be easier for the SAM crews to complete their destruction. If 
necessary the pilots can enter the SAM zones, distribute their 
efforts against the targets, altitudes, axes, and, if individual 
SAMs should be put out of action, also in terms of time of 
actions. Of course here it is necessary to adhere to minimally 
permissible ranges of closure with the adversary, and observe 
the restrictions in maneuver in order to assure safety against 
engagement by friendly missiles. Nonetheless, if one looks 
closely into such diverse variants of joint battle, one can see 
their surprising uniformity. They all flow from the role and 
place of fighter aviation, and are based on close interaction 
with SAM weapons and in this regard they are alike as two peas 
in a pod. The only difference lies in the conditions of battle 
and the tactical techniques. Only by rising to the height of 
this concept of joint battle can one see beyond today. 
  Thus as the most maneuverable and long-range AD asset, 
fighter aviation plays a decisive role in crushing the air 
adversary at the far approaches to the defended territory, and 
where the SAM complexes are less effective. Its place is in 
regions which are beyond the reach of SAM missiles (to the 
front, rear, on the flanks, and in gaps between kill zones), and 
if necessary (with high density of the enemy raid, or enemy 
strikes on the SAM complexes) even in these zones. 
  The importance and the irreplaceability of fighter aviation 
in air defense systems are determined by its high capabilities 
to combat planes carrying precision weapons, its capacity to 
fight independent combat actions with limited information about 
the air situation, to execute rapid maneuver from one axis to 
another, if events develop in such a way that the disposition of 
air defense manpower and assets no longer adequately correspond 
to it. 
  And finally, air defense fighter aviation shares its role 
and 
place with front-line fighters protecting the troops. After all, 
the air adversary will break through the regions of their combat 
actions to get to objectives in national rear. Therefore, the 
protection of troops and objects of the rear, as it were, merges 
into a single chain, although at first glance it appears that 
their links perform different missions. In fact only the 
conditions of combat action, and the place of the fighters in 
this chain, are different. Here too there are specific problems 
and variants. Sometimes fighters protecting the troops are the 
first to join battle and thus create favorable conditions for 
air defense fighters who are committed to battle at subsequent 
perimeters. At other times all the fighters operate in the same 
region and distribute their efforts by axes. Everything depends 
on the character of the enemy raid, the disposition of the 
protected objects and air bases, and the level of combat 
readiness of the fighters by the start of the raid. 
<H5>  4. The Tendency of Development of Air Defense and the </H5>
Tactics of Fighter Aviation 
  Now and in the foreseeable future, foreign military 
specialists believe, the basic problems of air defense will be: 
repulse of massed raids of aviation and other offensive air 
weapons operating in an enormous space and using powerful fire 
and electronic countermeasures; intercept of high-speed, 
low-visibility planes, cruise missiles, and drones at very low 
and very high altitude; combat with planes carrying 
new-generation precision weapons and destruction of missiles 
themselves while in trajectory; the high cost of air defense 
systems. 
  Of course these problems did not arise yesterday, and they 
have received close attention before, but at the present stage 
of development of air defense they must be resolved again, with 
allowance for the principle of defensive sufficiency. Such a 
precept did not exist in the past, but today it is the focus. It 
is necessary to stop the arms race and achieve a further 
increase in the strength of air defense through higher quality 
indices, on the basis of reasonable spending for defense. And do 
this given the mighty groups of offensive air weapons of the 
probable adversary, and the unceasing growth of their combat 
potential. But if the threat of attack continues, then a limited 
quantity of manpower and assets of air defense for reliable 
protection of troops and objects from surprise massed attacks 
from the air can be compensated for only through the development 
of favorable conditions for their timely and even prior 
commitment to battle, rational target distribution, and 
prevention of heavy losses on ground and in the air. These are 
quality indices, which determine the tendencies of development 
of air defense. As we see, the competition between the means of 
defense and offense acquire new traits proceeding from 
reasonable sufficiency. 
  There are a great many tendencies of development of air 
defense. We shall dwell only on the following, which exert a 
vital influence on the tactics of fighter aviation: the further 
increase in combat readiness of air defense; the aspiration to 
increase the range of detection and engagement of the air 
adversary; further centralization and automation of command and 
control, and enhancement of the survivability of air defense. 
  The further improvement in combat readiness of air defense 
acquires especially great importance given the defensive nature 
of military doctrine. This arises from the need to join battle 
with an air adversary at any minute, from the constant reduction 
of the already strict time limit which air defense has for 
preparation and repulse of massed raids. Vigilance is also a 
weapon. Having an adequate amount of even the most sophisticated 
combat equipment and trained personnel, the air defense forces 
will simply not have the time to exert the necessary 
countermeasures on the adversary, and will be caught unawares if 
the time required to make them ready remains as it is. 
  An increase in combat readiness consists in an increase in 
the strength of the alert forces, an increase in the mobility of 
SAM weapons in order to concentrate them in threat axes, but it 
acquires special importance for fighter aviation, which in 
comparison with SAM complexes takes significantly more time to 
destroy targets. In order to not find itself in a secondary role 
in the repulse of massed raids by an air adversary, its combat 
readiness must be significantly raised. This finds reflection in 
intensive hunts for ways to reduce the time required for takeoff 
and rapid massed commitment of fighters to battle, and also in 
fitting them with weapons which make it possible to fight brief 
but successful battles at maximum effort. In the intercept of a 
large number of targets simultaneously with airborne weapons 
sights, and their engagement in a single attack, the total time 
spent by the fighters in the air is also reduced, and they can 
prepare more quickly for more sorties. 
  In addition, the manpower and assets of air defense may be 
made combat-ready in a timely manner, and fighter aviation 
scrambled ahead of time if the air adversary is detected earlier 
than he is now. Inadequate range of detection has a negative 
affect on the level of combat readiness, and demands that a 
greater strength of alert assets be held ready for repulse of a 
surprise enemy attack. 
  The aspiration to increase the range of detection and 
engagement of the air adversary has always been one of the main 
tendencies of development of PVO systems. This tendency appeared 
with the growth in speed in the 60s and at the start of the 80s 
when precision air-to-ground missiles, launched from long range, 
and planes with small radar cross sections and weak IR radiation 
began to enter the air armament. 
  For successful functioning of air defense systems, the most 
radical solution of the problem would be extension of the range 
of detection to maximum values, i.e., to the home airfields of 
aviation, which would make it possible to detect its takeoff to 
deliver massed strikes. This idea was met with enthusiasm by 
military specialists abroad, who tried to implement it by 
creation and integrated use of ground and air assets, based both 
on traditional and on new principles of detection of air targets. 
  This tendency is manifested most strongly in the U.S., where 
they are constantly improving the existing system of radar 
early-warning aircraft (AWACS system) and developing 
fundamentally new means of reconnaissance -- over-the-horizon 
radars and space-based stations. How is this tendency in action? 
  The basis of the program for improving the radar early 
warning aircraft includes a modification of E-3A aircraft, an 
increase in the range of action of aircraft radars within the 
limits of direct visibility, and also modernization of the data 
processing apparatus for display and tracking of a large number 
of targets from this range. At the same time active development 
is under way for new radar early warning complexes based on 
dirigibles, captive balloons, helicopters and radars operating 
in the decimeter range, to detection of "stealth" aircraft, 
cruise missiles and other small targets which are unprotected in 
this range by anti-radar coatings. Variants in the use of radar 
early warning systems are also being improved. Organization of 
early-warning zones, a build-up of the ground radar field and 
enhancement of its stability in threat axes, the use of fighter 
guidance centers to raise the through-put of the system as a 
whole -- all these variants increase the range both of detection 
and of engagement of the air adversary. (MILITARY TECHNOLOGY, 
1986, No. 5; Defense ELECTRONICS, 1987, No. 7) 
  Over-the-horizon radars constitute a fundamentally new means 
of increasing the range of detection of the air adversary. 
Recall that the basis of the operation of these stations is the 
skip affect of short radio waves from the ionosphere and the 
surface of the earth, and also air targets and accompanying 
perturbations located in the path of their propagation. The 
capacity of over-the-horizon radars to detect these targets 
beyond the line of sight, and the enormous dimensions of the air 
space, several tens of times more than the zone of surveillance 
of conventional radars, have long attracted the attention of 
military scientists. 
  The capabilities of over-the-horizon radars are great. They 
are capable of detecting any air targets over all altitudes in a 
range from 900-3,000 km and more, and need not fear anti-radar 
missiles. Although the linear dimensions of the antenna systems 
of these stations reach several kilometers (fig. 36 [not 
reproduced]), it is impossible to determine the direction of the 
operating radars. You see, their signals scatter due to the 
reflection from the ionosphere. But an even greater advantage 
over the other assets is obtained by virtue of the capacity to 
detect plans and cruise missiles with significantly reduced 
radar cross sections. This advantage is especially important. It 
is understood that the lower the radar cross section of an 
object, the later the radar will "see" it. The comparative range 
of detection of planes with different cross section (the F-117A 
fighter, the B-1B and B-52 bombers with cross sections of 1, 10 
and 100 square meters respectively) according to the 
calculations of American specialists are shown in figure 37. 
(FLIGHT, 1988. No. 4142; FLUG REVUE, 1989, No. 1.) From the 
figure it is clear that the range of detection of the "stealth" 
aircraft is 3-10 times less than that of conventional planes 
even in the absence of electronic jamming. Such a short range 
cannot be compensated for by an increase in the number of ground 
radars. Therefore the crews of "stealth" planes probably will 
detect observation of them first, and will take the necessary 
countermeasures. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-55A>      Figure 37. Comparative range of detection of radars with different radar cross-sections by </FIG>


  However, one must disappoint the foreign specialists. For 
the 
methods of reducing the radar visibility of aircraft which are 
known at present are effective only in a limited frequency range 
(1-20 GHz), in which, it is true, most exist air defense radars 
still operate. With simultaneous use of radars operating in very 
different ranges, and with an increase in the wave length of the 
radiated pulses, the detectability of the "stealth" aircraft 
will increase. In itself this circumstance cannot provoke any 
objections, theoretically it is all correct -- the wave length 
of the over-the-horizon radar is much greater than in radars of 
the centimeter range. 
  However, the designers do not place very great hopes in the 
over-the-horizon radars. The fact is that they operate with 
short waves (10-100 m) and therefore have low resolution of 
angular coordinates (less than 1x) and determine the location of 
targets with significant errors, and are susceptible to the 
influence of natural and artificial interference. In addition, 
their capabilities of detecting targets depend on the state of 
the ionosphere. Therefore although air defense does not greatly 
require precise characteristics of targets at long range, it is 
still impossible to rely only on over-the-horizon radars. 
  Another means for increasing the range of detection of 
"stealth" aircraft might be radars with separated transmitters 
and receivers, so-called two-position, or bistatic radars (fig. 
38). The transmitter illuminates the target and the receivers 
pick up its signals reflected away from the source of radiation. 
Despite the obvious simplicity of the operating principle of 
two-position radars, this too has its problems. Detection of 
"stealth" aircraft is possible only in a limited region, where 
the beam of the transmitter and the field of action of the 
receivers intersect. It is also necessary to have apparatus for 
precise synchronization of operation of transmitter and 
receivers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-56A>      Figure 38. Operating principle of two-position radar. </FIG>


  I should also mention one fundamentally new means of 
reconnaissance, possessing unlimited range of detection -- 
space-based radars. They are just being developed and 
experimental modes are far from practical utilization. There are 
many complex design and tactical problems in the path of 
producing acceptable radar characteristics: development of large 
space antennas, reduction in the hindering background radiation 
of the earth, the selection and optimization of surveillance 
zones, the altitudes and inclinations of orbits for a look at 
air space of interest to air defense manpower and assets. The 
creators of space radars hope that these and other problems 
arising in the course of their development will be resolved. 
Then, such radars mounted on several satellites, deployed in 
single orbit and at specific distances from one another, will 
make it possible to obtain information about the activity of 
aviation in the most remote regions of basing and over their 
entire routes to targets with good regularity. 
  Thus integrated use of all means will make it possible to 
form an external high-altitude thousand-kilometer field and warn 
the air defense system of the flight of an air adversary in a 
time which is close to the complete flight time of the planes 
and missiles of the opposing side. 
  As for engagement of the air adversary at the far approaches 
to the defended territory, here for the present we can see no 
other air defense assets except for fighters. Their range of 
action may be increased by in-flight refueling and their control 
from air-born command posts. Moved out to pre-established main 
directions of enemy raids, they will create favorable conditions 
for successive commitment of fighters to battle at remote 
perimeters, and also will be capable of interaction with SAM 
complexes. 
  Naturally the further removal of the points of engagement 
away from the defended objects and air bases will pose new 
problems for tactics. What unexpected obstacles and surprises 
await the pilots in their flight to a remote battle zone? These 
may include sharp changes in the weather, unreliable 
communications with ground control centers and a broken radar 
field, where there is no information about the adversary, and 
the search for him as he uses various tactical ruses, and the 
adoption of a decision for the battle from rare target 
designations from the airborne command post. And what high 
demands will be put on piloting equipment, apparatus for control 
of group actions, on tactical proficiency of the flight 
personnel. Under such circumstances they will require bravery, 
initiative, and the will for victory. 
  Further centralization and automation of control are 
required 
by the need to use more considerable amounts of manpower and 
assets of air defense, in terms of composition and numbers, in a 
large volume of air space, and coordination of their actions in 
shorter time periods. 
  The construction of large and complex systems, centralizing 
command and control and automating its process, began about 
thirty years ago. As a result the widely advertised antiaircraft 
air defense system of the North American continent "SAGE" 
appeared. Somewhat later a combined air defense system for the 
NATO countries of Europe was developed and continues to function 
today. Command and control of air defense assets in this system 
are centralized, and implemented from "NAGE" automated control 
centers, providing collection, processing, transmission, and 
display of data regarding the air situation and the state of 
combat readiness of air defense assets, target designation of 
SAM complexes and guidance of fighters. Automation of these 
processes, and also the elimination of certain intermediate 
links in the chain of data processing, led to a sharp reduction 
in time expenditures. In comparison with manual processing of 
data, the time of passage of data in the semi-automated systems 
was reduced by 50 percent, and in fully automated systems by 
85-90 percent. (ALLGEMEINE SCHWEIZER MILITAERZEITSCHRIFT, 1973, 
No. 2; TRUPPENPRAXIS, 1975, No. 2.) 
  The advent of highly automated systems, which received 
intensive development by the end of the 60s, somewhat blunted 
the attention of military specialists to their further 
development, but not for long. Today the talk of their 
development is again going strong. But why has this tendency 
appeared? 
  The answer lies in two problems which become urgent in air 
defense. The first has to do with the now inadequate 
capabilities of existing systems for coordination of efforts of 
major air defense forces of different armed services and quick 
reaction to the actions of similar major forces of the air 
adversary. The second problem is to develop automated systems of 
command and control and multichannel data lines which would 
assure integrated command and control of air defense groupings 
at different levels, and the rational distribution of functions 
among them. For the time being the elements of command and 
control which often duplicate one another leads to overload of 
systems and unjustified losses of time. 
  Consequently, today there are much more complex tasks -- the 
creation of an air defense system ensuring integrated use of all 
manpower and assets of air defense with centralized command and 
control, regardless of their affiliation to a specific armed 
service. 
  But what interpretation do NATO military specialists impart 
to the concept of "further centralization and automation of 
command and control"? It should be noted that it is still not 
very concrete. The issue is to enlarge the systems within one or 
adjacent theaters of military action (TVDs), link operational 
air defense centers with mobile automated systems of troop air 
defense, a system of reconnaissance and monitoring of air space 
at a higher level, and subordination of all of them to a single 
command. 
  In the technical context this tendency is expressed in a 
higher through-put capacity of the automated control systems, 
speed of processing and transmission of data in command and 
control nets, and more importantly, in a uniform software, used 
in all the computer centers, and access to data for all 
sub-systems and users. Automatic systems capable of sorting, 
sifting, synthesizing, and displaying data in accordance with 
the needs of the various command levels, are simply 
indispensable here. After all, all the collected data are needed 
by them to different degrees and in different forms. Too great 
an amount of data hinders its utilization at the operational 
level, while at the tactical level, on the contrary, detailed 
data of each air target is required. 
  However, for now one can speak only of partial successes and 
realization of individual technical solutions. There are many 
causes: the difference in views regarding the essence of 
processes and methods of command and control, the diversity of 
methods of solving problems given the similarity of targets and 
the diversity of designed electronic equipment. It is also 
unclear what machines to use for the software. 
  Broad centralization of command and control undoubtedly will 
make it possible to achieve a maximal effect in using fighters 
over extended regions, since they will turn up precisely in the 
axis and at the time when they are most needed for the repulse 
of massed strikes. Automatic target distribution and issuance of 
target designations to pilots from the fighter command post in 
turn will reduce the cycles of command and control and raise the 
accuracy of guidance to air targets. However it is still 
necessary to attain mutual understanding between many levels and 
precise distribution of command and control functions among them. 
  Acting within the framework of major automated command and 
control systems, fighter aviation must be committed to battle 
with special precision in place and time; uncoordinated actions 
between units, tactical formations and ground air defense assets 
are unacceptable. High accuracy is needed in using automatic 
systems for command and control of air-to-air battles, and in 
all systems based on interaction of man and machine, where 
issuance of computer recommendations to the commander, automatic 
generation and transmission of commands to the aircraft are 
envisioned. 
  Enhancement of the survivability of air defense is 
associated 
with the increased capabilities of precision weapons and 
reconnaissance-strike complexes of the opposing side with regard 
to electronic suppression of various elements of the air defense 
system. You see, in any system various electronic equipment are 
and will be used whose emissions are difficult to conceal from 
the enemy reconnaissance even in peacetime. With the start of 
repulse of his raids, the air defense systems will reveal 
themselves even more by turning on its many radars and 
communications equipment and will become convenient targets for 
precision weapons homing in on radiating sources. 
  This tendency has deep roots and a complex history. It found 
intensive development after the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1967, 
when the Israeli Air Force succeeded from the very start in 
inflicting great damage on the aviation of the Arab countries 
and suppressing their air defense systems. Allowing for the 
unexpected and dramatic consequences of this conflict, the 
military air defense commands of many countries immediately 
began to raise the survivability of their air defense systems. 
Simple reinforced concrete shelters appeared at airfields for 
the planes, SAM complexes began to protect airfields, and 
engineer preparation of radar positions and creation of decoy 
targets simulating the operation of air defense assets were 
started. 
  At present this tendency has received new impetus due to the 
stormy growth in capabilities of the opposing side to engage air 
defense installations. The reader is already familiar from the 
preceding chapter with the efforts which aviation has exerted to 
combat air defense, the difficulties which defense has 
encountered in the harsh confrontation with the air adversary. 
It will not be easy to safeguard the security of fighter 
aviation at airfields. Vulnerability to precision weapons, 
especially anti-airfield ones, which create small but numerous 
foci of destruction on the runways (For example, the American 
DAASM combination munitions, which consists of 8 penetrating 
charges with high kinetic energy to destroy the runway, and 24 
mines, which prevent approach to it. -- AIR FORCES, 1987, No. 
11), reduce the fighting capacity of fighter aviation. In 
addition, a larger portion of modern fighters are poorly adapted 
to actions from dirt airfields, so fighter aviation is 
restricted in terms of airfield maneuver. 
  In order to raise the survivability of air defense in all of 
its links, many measures have been taken. These include 
expansion of the net of hardened command and control points, 
fixed, mobile, airborne, and adoption of radars and SAM 
complexes which are scattered in the terrain, camouflage and 
concealment from missiles and aerial bombs with electro-optic 
homing heads, and much else. Of course these measures are quite 
difficult, and it would be impetuous to judge their 
effectiveness examining the essence of the ongoing processes, 
but we are more interested in how the tendency of enhanced 
survivability is manifested in fighter aviation. 
  Let us begin with the fact that in accordance with this 
tendency, the need remains for the fighters to be disposed in 
strong, hardened shelters, the creation of standby runways, and 
the conduct of other such traditional measures. However 
precision weapons have vitally devalued them. One can say that 
now there is no problem with destroying targets at airfields 
(depending on the range and strength of the weapons), but there 
does exist a problem of finding them and obtaining precision 
coordinates. 
  One thing is clear. In the interest of reliable defense of 
fighter aviation at airfields, it is necessary to ensure maximal 
covertness of its basing. It is much harder to camouflage 
airfields than other air defense installations. Today reduction 
in their tell-tale signs and integrated countermeasures to all 
types of enemy reconnaissance are now no longer enough. 
Therefore frequent and rapid relocation of fighter command and 
control centers, maneuver of subunits from one airfield to 
another, and also the creation of decoy installations, which 
make it possible to trick the adversary with respect to the true 
fighter aviation grouping, are becoming more preferable.

  In our day fundamentally new means of air attack are being 
developed and introduced very quickly. The tactical techniques 
of these assets are changing just as rapidly. And in these 
surprising leaps, the need to maintain the constant combat 
readiness of fighter aviation, and raise the tactical 
proficiency of the flight personnel to repel aggression with 
minimal losses stands out even more. This then is the principle 
of defensive sufficiency, flowing from the nature of Soviet 
military doctrine. 
<H5>  PART TWO. TACTICS REVEAL THE SECRETS </H5>
<H5>  Chapter V. Before Battle Is Joined </H5>
<H5>  1. Guess or Foresee? </H5>
  Does the pilot, and especially the command have the desire 
to 
precisely foresee the coming battle? Yes, this is the goal of 
their work in preparing for battle. But it is not enough to have 
a goal, one must also understand how this goal may be achieved, 
what methods to use. But this question has been answered in 
different ways at different times. 
  Intuition and inspiration, not a clever plan concocted on 
the 
ground, decides the success of battle. They themselves will come 
to the pilot when he meets the enemy in the air; after all, you 
can't foresee everything -- such is the assertion living 
steadfastly on in the consciousness of some pilots from the days 
of the Great Patriotic War, and one can sometimes hear it even 
today from people with a poor knowledge of tactics. This is not 
surprising. Ignorance, dilettantism, guesswork -- these are also 
a favorable soil for idle arguments and silly conjectures. 
  Practical experience of the past and present demonstrates 
something different: many of the components of future victory 
are laid in the successfully developed battle plan. Surprise, 
closure, rapidity of attack, quick response to sudden critical 
situations in battle -- all these are derivatives of the 
well-developed battle plan. No wonder they say that a battle is 
fought twice: once in thought, then in action. 
  Commanders of all levels, when planning a battle, have long 
sought to look into the future, to anticipate the enemy actions, 
who in turn exerted no less effort, through camouflage, 
concealment and disinformation, to pass off the true for the 
false and the false for the true. During the front years, battle 
planning achieved a high level of perfection. On the basis of 
accumulated experience, logical conclusions, expert assessments, 
aviation commanders determined ahead of time the nature and time 
of actions of enemy aviation, the combat capability of the 
fascist pilots, what "surprises" they were preparing to spring, 
and then, without strict mathematical criteria, they created in 
their minds models of the upcoming battle. This allowed them to 
select and practice an expedient order of action. Many of these 
models were polished direction in battles in accordance with the 
answering tactical actions of the adversary, which were hard to 
foresee. 
  Two-time Hero of the Soviet Union, A. Vorozheykin, 
predicting 
the tactics of the adversary in April 1944 in the Lvov axis, 
noticed that during raids on our forces, the fighters which led 
the way had the goal of either shooting down our fighter barrier 
or diverting it away through demonstrative actions and opening a 
lane to the targets of the strike. In the latter case the 
fascists, without numerical superiority, approached 
challengingly close, but did not join battle. Foreseeing the 
enemy tactics, A. Vorozheykin led his squadron to protect the 
troops. His prediction was justified. First on the horizon 
appeared four FW-190s, but seeing that they could not attack the 
fighters by surprise, they raced to the side, literally exposing 
themselves to a strike. Soon another pair appeared, and hung 
over the squadron threateningly. The enemy intent was clear, and 
the commander did not rush to join battle. He had to wait. And 
in fact, after a few minutes a report came from the guidance 
center that a large group of bombers were approaching. This was 
the decisive minute! The battle was fast-moving, the attacks 
swift and sudden. The fascists suffered serious damage, and the 
aimed strike on the troops was thwarted. 
  It is easy to find such analogues of foresight in the 
experience of local wars. In the Vietnam war, pilots of American 
Phantoms were baffled: how were North Vietnamese pilots able to 
intercept them even before they broke from a closed to an open 
battle formation (to form up for the target approach)? New means 
of detection, new planes and weapons? Indeed no, in no case. 
This happened because the air commanders, recording the routes, 
flight altitudes, and nature of action of the Phantoms were able 
to foresee their tactics ahead of time. Knowing the habits of 
the enemy, the North Vietnamese fighters developed and applied a 
method of combat actions from ambush on the ground and in the 
air. Secretly flying to forward airfields half-destroyed by 
American aviation, which the enemy did not notice, they were 
committed to the battle suddenly and attacked Phantoms flying in 
a dense battle formation, from close range. 
  In our time it has become much harder than in the past to 
foresee how events will unfold. The situation has become more 
fluid and complex, the aviation equipment more diverse. Battle 
formations dispersed over tens of kilometers, the development of 
EW assets and much else have changed the picture of 
confrontation of the sides. The mentally predicted air-to-air 
battle, and the foresight which air commanders have or do not 
have, are marked by much greater complexity. 
  How then can one create a reliable and faithful analogue to 
the battle situation in which the fighters must operate? How can 
one study that which does not exist, but might (and might not), 
in a more or less remote future? 
  These are not easy questions. Any prediction is based on 
elements of the known and quite unfamiliar, but in their 
aggregate quite predictable things. In one way or another, there 
is a kind of logic in all things. In tactics everything is 
always interrelated and controlled at times by obvious threads, 
more often by invisible ones. Nonetheless, there are secrets to 
prediction. As a creative process these lie in the objective, 
law-governed regularities of air-to-air battle, which are 
knowable. 
  Of course there are some difficulties involved in knowing, 
and thus in foreseeing. How may they be overcome in order to see 
these law-governed regularities behind the variety of battle 
phenomena? In speaking of this, we always operate with concepts 
such as sound knowledge of the basics of air-to-air combat, 
equipment, and tactics, one's own and those of the enemy. But 
knowledge is by no means all. It is not enough to memorize 
precepts, formulas, numbers. So that they may be reflected in 
foresight, one must also be able to consider the whole group of 
factors influencing battle, uncover the deep processes of battle 
dynamics, their causal relationships. Prediction of future 
situations is closely associated with the use of probability 
methods. 
  And what about intuition and inspiration, which come to the 
aid of the commander? Their role cannot be discarded from the 
scales, they are very important qualities, which supplement 
probability methods. But it is rightly said that all intuition 
is the result of erudition: earlier-accumulated knowledge, 
acquired experience and skills. Thus it is worth something when 
it relies on high professional training of the commander, and 
precise calculation. 
  Before looking into the essence of the questions which have 
been posed, let us note that the whole circuit of difficult 
problems of foresight may be found only in special, quite 
extensive military-science literature. But for us only specific 
conclusions are important, and in the narrower meaning -- as 
applied to the sphere of combat actions of fighters. For a clear 
understanding of the essence of foresight and its practical 
utilization in planning air-to-air battle, these conclusions may 
be boiled down to three characteristic features: two-sidedness, 
soundness, and specificity of foresight. 
  Foresight is a two-sided process, which flows from the 
essence of dialectics which considers all the phenomena in their 
inter-relationship and mutual causation. Such an approach is 
quite complex, since the combat capabilities and tactics of the 
sides (friendly and enemy) are revealed in a harsh 
confrontation, are mutually dependent, and constantly being 
improved. 
  Incorrect allowance for the correlation of combat 
capabilities of the sides leads to one-sided assessments and may 
give rise to errors: an overestimate of the capabilities of 
friendly fighters and an underestimate of the capabilities of 
the adversary (equating capabilities with realities or vice 
versa). 
  In tactics an overestimate of one's own capabilities 
engenders unconcern and conceit. For instance, fighters with 
weapons sight systems and weapons for long-range attack were 
given the position of a multiple aircraft air-to-air battle. 
During planning of the battle, the group leader allowed for the 
undoubted superiority over the "adversary," who did not have 
such weapons, and decided to attack him head-on. The pilots had 
seemingly calculated everything, and the outcome of the battle 
was already decided. But when the group went aloft and detected 
the "adversary" it began to close, but did not get to the point 
of missile launch. The pilots preparing for launch were 
subjected to a surprise attack from a different group, and in 
this tactical situation they suffered "losses." 
  One of the causes of the defeat, if not the main one, was 
the 
underestimate of the capabilities of the "adversary," who more 
realistically foresaw the actions of the fighters and allowed 
for the psychology of their leader, who was aware of his 
superiority in long-range weapons. At the last moment, on the 
approach to the expected line of attack, the planes of the 
"adversary" broke sharply, forming a strike group and a small 
diversionary element, which foiled the missile strike. The 
leader did not foresee this turn of events and did not provide 
for countermeasures. 
  It is no less dangerous to underestimate one's own 
capabilities and overestimate the capabilities of the adversary. 
This is precisely what happened with another group of fighters, 
which was performing the mission of troop defense. The planes of 
the "adversary" used electronic jamming, the situation at the 
command post was unclear, and command and control of the 
fighters was unstable. Under these conditions, the group leader 
saw a group of bombers which outnumbered the group of fighters. 
The situation was critical, for the "adversary" was already 
approaching the targets of the strike. 
  What was to be done? Of course an immediate attack and 
report 
to the command post was necessary in order that it build up 
forces of the attackers, but the leaders, recalling the battle 
plan, in which such a situation was not envisaged, found nothing 
better than to avoid battle and continue to hunt for other, 
smaller targets. One wonders if perhaps he in fact had no other 
way out. No, he simply underestimated his own capabilities. 
Remember what Suvorov said: "Not numbers, ability." It was 
necessary to have the courage to attack a numerically superior 
"adversary." Passivity in the air was tantamount to cowardice. 
But then we cannot count quantity as something secondary. For 
the issue is massing of the efforts of the fighters against 
larger targets. This could be done by the command post guiding 
the fighters, if the leader had promptly reported the nature of 
the target, but he kept silent about the encounter in order to 
avoid being rebuked for his irresolute actions. 
  The art of foresight is inseparable from the estimate of 
capabilities of friendly forces. At first glance it would seem 
that there is frankly speaking nothing to foresee here, since 
all these capabilities are familiar to the commander. But the 
fact is that they do not exist in and of themselves, but in 
comparison with the combat capabilities of the adversary. The 
capabilities of one and the same subunit, all other things being 
equal, will be different in battle with an inexperienced or 
strong enemy. In addition, the adversary himself will take 
measures, predicting our capabilities and intentions, and what 
is more, will influence the estimates and logic of the commander 
in order to direct his actions in a direction favorable to 
himself. Therefore it is natural to suppose that the adversary 
first of all will strive to fully utilize his own combat 
capabilities in order to deliver a strike of maximum strength, 
and second through camouflage, concealment and disinformation to 
trick the commander. Thus the enemy plan is almost never 
manifested with the completeness the commander would wish, or 
becomes known only after he has passed the lines of commitment 
of the fighters to battle. 
  The total correlation of combat capabilities of the sides 
may 
be expressed most conveniently in quantitative terms, in the 
number of planes participating in the battle, and in 
quantitative-qualitative terms, by a comparative assessment of 
the performance characteristics, weapons and equipment using the 
existing coefficients of combat potentials, numerical values of 
combat capabilities, if the qualitative indices are unequal. 
From the whole variety of various characteristics, it is 
necessary to select and compare the main ones, which have the 
greatest importance for accomplishment of the upcoming mission 
(speed, acceleration, maneuver characteristics of the aircraft, 
dimensions of radar detection zones and interference protection 
of the weapons sights, characteristics of the missiles, cannon, 
and EW equipment). Such a comparison makes it possible to find 
the areas of superiority of one's fighters in definite ranges of 
altitudes and speeds, to select expedient tactical techniques 
depending on the expected actions of the adversary. 
  Thus the two-sidedness of foresight allows the commander not 
only to more profoundly assess his own capabilities, but also to 
better foresee the actions of the adversary, which as a rule are 
a response to the tactics of the fighters. Forcing him to act in 
the spirit of his own concept, the commander as it were 
"creates" the situation. 
  Soundness of foresight is based on a profound knowledge of 
the law-governed regularities of battle, complete abandonment of 
a subjective approach, earlier-adopted and quite possibly 
erroneous prejudices and schemes. After all, it sometimes 
happens that the very same information in the minds of different 
commanders will acquire a different emotional coloration, and 
this can lead to an unobjective estimate. 
  However, in addition to the law-governed regularities, a 
battle is influenced by accidents, with which the air situation 
is replete. Sometimes a pilot miscalculates in battle and tries 
to explain this as an accidental confluence of circumstances 
which it is hard to foresee, and at times impossible. Is this 
really the case? 
  As the philosophers say, randomness is an objective 
category. 
Even in the most improbable event, after it has occurred they 
strive to find the law-governed regularities. It is hard for us 
to resist this temptation too. The adversary is before us. His 
behavior in battle cannot be considered random, but it is not 
repeated many times either. A smart adversary always proceeds 
from our logic, strives to foresee it, and strives not to use a 
single tactical technique. 
  Let us return to the example in which the leader, 
underestimating the capabilities of the "adversary," was 
subjected to a surprise attack, when victory was close. Did this 
situation develop by accident? No, for the "adversary" nothing 
at all unexpected happened. He calculated his battle plan and 
worked it through ahead of time. But our leader, planning his 
battle, did not suspect that he would operate according to the 
decision which the "adversary" had foreseen. The situation 
became critical also due to the unreadiness of the fighters for 
a maneuver battle. So were these two events accidental? 
Certainly not! They were both a consequence of the convergence 
of two objective and mutually independent causes. Held captive 
by prejudiced and desired estimates, the group leader himself 
promoted the first of them, and the second came about due to the 
unexpectedness of the first. 
  Of course one could relate differently to such unsuccessful 
planning. One could reason like this, for instance: are there 
many accidently, unforeseen situations in battle? Since they are 
unforeseeable, why not avoid them? After all, battle is battle. 
Anything might happen. But in this case can one say that 
accidents happened? That they were simply inevitable? If they 
did not happen, this would contradict common sense. No wonder 
they say that accident is an unknown principle in operation. 
This familiar saying sounds particularly apt in this situation. 
Such accidents could have been prevented or at least reduced to 
a minimum if the leader was able to foresee this natural turn of 
the battle. The commander cannot foresee precisely what tactical 
tricks the adversary would prepare for deception and 
disinformation of the fighters in the given battle, cannot know 
who would detect whom first, in what specific situation the 
fighters would be relative to the adversary. He cannot have an 
idea either of further failures of aviation equipment or ground 
control assets due to their reliability, or errors which the 
pilots might commit at a given stage of the battle. For example, 
the very fact of detection of an adversary on the left of the 
battle formation of the group, or an error of one of the pilots 
in aiming, are random events. Even if such events are of low 
probability, this does not prevent them from appearing, but one 
must allow for these accidents, and take the necessary measures. 
  Consequently, of course one can predict the occurrence of a 
particular accident, but one cannot predict a specific 
manifestation of it with respect to place, time, or form. 
Foresight in most cases is presumptive in nature and most often 
is based on probability methods. This means that estimates are 
based on average results and make it possible to determine only 
a tendency of development of the process in question. But the 
final outcome of accomplishment of a mission is random, one can 
only construct suppositions about it. Low values of indices of 
effectiveness of combat actions of fighters by no means rule out 
the possibility of victory. Sometimes they show that the 
developed plan of battle is not the best, and it is necessary to 
look for other alternatives. 
  The basis of foresight is the hypothesis, a presumption with 
a certain level of probability. Here it is easy to go wrong. 
Therefore one cannot rush to unequivocal assessments, but one 
can and should foresee the range of possible changes of the 
situation, i.e., a certain amount of variants of the battle. 
Here in order to remove or rightly allow for uncertainty of the 
situation, one must also allow both for the completeness and the 
reliability of the existing data, and for the commander's will, 
which links the reliable information with the supposed. But the 
amount of each of these components is different. Let us suppose 
that you know the combat missions and intentions of the 
adversary, but in the other case you know only that the 
adversary will be somewhere in the sky. The answer is clear. The 
more complete the data, the more weighty will be the 
contribution made to foresight by strict calculations, the less 
data, the greater the role played by suppositions, logic, and 
the commander's will. 
  But will the prediction always be justified? To think this 
is 
to think the enemy a fool. The soundness of foresight lies in 
discerning tendencies of the predicted battle, which operate as 
an objective necessity, and arise as a result of accidents or 
voluntary decisions. 
  Specificity of foresight consists in the directness, the 
purposefulness and flexibility of the thinking process of the 
commander. It makes it possible to narrow the circle of analyzed 
situations and vary only the group of those which are typical 
for the expected situation, and also quickly correct one's 
estimates when it changes. 
  Of course each commander is interested in most completely 
imagining the picture of the coming battle, more deeply getting 
at the essence of its contradictions. But foresight is exercised 
not for the satisfaction of idle curiosity. In order not to 
drown in secondary questions, for the assigned combat mission 
the commander must first correctly clarify what precisely he 
wants to foresee, know at a minimum what he is striving for. The 
answer to this question may be found not so much in the content 
of the combat mission itself, as in what is known and unknown to 
the commander, and does he need to know what he doesn't know. 
But if the commander has only a vague idea of what he wants, 
then numerous assessments of the most diverse situations, the 
method of trial and error, will not help him. Two-sidedness and 
soundness of foresight does not change the essence of the 
matter. It is a question chiefly of the level of detail, the 
accuracy of foresight, the distinguishing of precisely those 
situations which have decisive importance for planning of the 
specific battle. 
  Ideally the battle plan is, indisputably, as specific as 
possible. But an excessively rigid plan, overloaded with 
specifics and details, not only is difficult to execute, forcing 
the pilots to devote a greater part of their attention to 
keeping the set order of actions, but also hampers them in 
reacting to the actually developing situation. Sometimes one 
encounters commanders who, on the contrary, try to plan the 
battle in the most general outlines. They construct the model of 
an enemy raid, distribute fight forces along the point of 
engagement, announce the procedures for command and control and 
interaction, and believe that they have planned the battle. Such 
planning, where all specific actions of the pilots are left to 
the will of circumstance, testifies to poor tactical proficiency 
on the part of the commander. Therefore the level of detail of 
planning, and consequently also of foresight, should respond to 
the requirement not to constrain the reasonable initiative and 
tactical thinking of the pilots, but at the same time to permit 
allowance for the greatest number of factors of the combat 
situation. 
  But will prediction always be accurate? To think it will is 
to insult the adversary. It is impossible to achieve absolutely 
accurate values of all parameters of expected actions in battle, 
and the results of foresight will always differ to some degree 
from the actual development of events. And indeed, what sort of 
guaranteed accuracy of prediction of enemy actions can there be 
if even the battle formation of the subunit cannot be maintained 
with absolute precision and with those parameters which the 
commander puts in the battle plan? Nor is such ideal realization 
of foresight required. Everything depends on for whose interests 
it is conducted. 
  Suppose that a pair or flight of fighters is preparing for 
an 
air-to-air battle. Here it is necessary to carefully calculate 
the conditions and procedures for accomplishment of literally 
each maneuver, one's own and the adversary's one is to fight. 
The regiment commander does not require such specificity. For 
him, it is enough to foresee the totality of these conditions 
and maneuvers as the foundation for development of a battle plan 
of the fighter subunits combined by a common concept. But even 
here foresight should be adequately specific. 
  For example, if the commander needs to plan a battle while 
protecting ground troops, he must limit himself to prediction of 
the actions of only that enemy aviation may deliver strikes on 
the troops in the protected region, and only in the given time 
of protection. This of course does not rule out a situation in 
which the subunit is small but accomplishes an important task 
(individual flight or pair acting to tie down the adversary in 
the interests of all other tactical groups) and becomes the 
object of the close attention of the commander. 
  Limitation of the framework of foresight in accordance with 
the scale of the task to be performed allows the commanders of 
various levels to forego "global" assessments and vagueness of 
thought, and to focus on the search for answers only to those 
questions which flow from the non-specificity of the situation. 
  Thus two-sidedness, soundness and specificity make it 
possible to predict the air situation, however complex it may 
be, to consider it not as a manifestation of "chaotic," "blind" 
randomness, but the result of actions of the adversary and 
friendly fighters. It is precisely foresight which serves as the 
criterion for the commander's farsightedness and tactical 
thinking. Now the times themselves pose the question: How then 
can we plan a battle which has a fair amount of variants? 
<H5>  2. Calculate Seven Times, Decide Once </H5>
  One can clearly sin against truth if one says that after 
receiving a combat mission the commander and his pilots 
immediately begin to plan the battle. No, at times they do not 
know how to approach the planning, and as their knowledge and 
skills will allow they try to foresee the conditions of the 
upcoming battle. Usually the pilots first look for analogies, 
more or less similar to a situation with which they are 
familiar. They use them for subsequent discussions and 
comparisons with the expected situation, they strive to think 
for the adversary, to delve into his possible assessments, 
decisions, tactics, socio-psychological aspects determining his 
behavior in battle. And the latter tries to do every thing to 
conceal his plan and to force his will on the fighters. Thus 
there is always a danger that one will fall victim to artful 
camouflage and disinformation by the adversary. One must also 
allow for many other circumstances which do not lead to 
unequivocal assessments. 
  Opportunities for comprehensive allowance for diverse 
conditions which may arise in battle are offered by modelling, 
which allows one to reproduce, study and analyze all the ups and 
downs of engagement and development of battle, to qualitatively 
predict its results. 
  Modelling in tactics as a method of scientific foresight for 
the time being remains the basis for planning air-to-air 
battles. The two-sided process of foresight also requires 
two-sided modelling. Here one can assume that the general 
law-governed regularities of tactics are objective, and to a 
significant degree apply to both opposing sides. Each of the 
sides strives to create conditions which are favorable for the 
actions of their forces, and at the same time to counter the 
analogous aspirations of the adversary. 
  Consequently the model of an upcoming battle may be 
presented 
in the form of two interrelated models. On the one hand, the 
model of the expected actions of the adversary, and, on the 
other, the model of the battle with him. There can be very many 
such models. 
  Today simulating and modelling complexes are already being 
developed which include automatic control systems of fighter 
control centers, integrated simulators for pilots, and 
data-display equipment, and numerous models of air-to-air 
battles have been developed and displayed on computers. These 
allow automated vectoring of the pilots to the battle region, 
realization of the commander's decision to destroy the air 
targets, modelling and testing of tactical techniques and 
maneuvers for specific situations in battle with any aircraft of 
the adversary. 
  But what if the regiment still does not have such complexes? 
Then the traditional, graphic-analysis modeling still remains in 
force. Of course its basis is monotonous, hard work to register 
a whole series of calculations. But even the simplest techniques 
of graphic-analysis modelling, with which the pilots are quite 
familiar, make it possible to calculate and analyze various 
situations of battle. At any moment one can compare what happens 
if when such-and-such maneuvers are used, the adversary responds 
in such-and-such a manner. If you have doubts, change the 
conditions and repeat the modelling. But for all the 
multiplicity of modelled situations, one should proceed from the 
fact that the adversary, by selecting the axis and the time of 
the raid, determines the conditions of the battle only at the 
very start. Subsequently the fighters can force their own will 
and tactics on him, not forgetting however that the adversary 
will seek to do the same to them. The very posing of the 
question shows the direct link between modelling and foresight. 
  All these truths are meant for the uninitiated reader. 
Pilots, not to mention air commanders, are well aware of the 
rich possibilities offered by modelling of air-to-air battles. 
  But then, we will not go into the details and nuances of 
modelling. There are no cliche techniques here, as there are no 
identical air-to-air battles. Each pilot, depending on the level 
of his knowledge, experience and even temperament, will proceed 
in his own way, but the first step is always the same, that is, 
clarification of the task, the goals of modelling, and selection 
of tactical situations. But how many, and which situations 
should be chosen from those that are possible? If one takes all 
possible situations for modelling, one will simply bog down in a 
sea of calculations. 
  No unequivocal answer can be found in a single book of 
tactics, for this would contradict the very nature of the 
creative thought process, which is specific in each separate 
case. For any air-to-air battle, depending on the expected 
actions of the adversary, the weather conditions and other 
conditions, one must model a certain number of situations. They 
will not be the same number of situations, and are determined 
first of all by the level of indeterminacy of the situation. 
Some of the components of its factors are known, others remain 
undiscovered for some time, and perhaps remain unknown. An 
identical answer is as impossible as a single plan of battle for 
different conditions. There are many answers, and even more 
approaches. 
  Here is one of them. Let us suppose that it is necessary to 
plan actions of fighters to perform two combat missions of 
differing content: interception and an air-to-air battle with 
enemy planes in repulse of a massed raid, and conduct of a 
"hunt." 
  When planning an interception and air-to-air battle on the 
basis of knowledge and prediction of the general principles, 
combat strength and disposition of the enemy forces in a massed 
raid, guided by the logic of his thinking and by available 
information, one can construct a model of the raid, foresee the 
tactics of the groups and individual crews, but one should not 
count on a detailed, reliable model. When planning a "hunt," the 
level of indeterminacy is even greater. Where will the adversary 
be encountered, will it happen at all, what types of planes will 
there be, their number, the battle formation, the resistance by 
air defenses -- all this is known only approximately, or not at 
all. 
  But on the other hand, there are a number of well-known 
factors which are determined by the content of the combat 
mission and the conditions of its accomplishment, and do not 
require prediction. These include the flight models to the 
interception and to the "hunt" region, the points of engagement 
of the fighters, the corridors for passage of the front line 
upon returning from combat missions. 
  For all the diversity of combat missions, one cannot fail to 
note the similarity here: the indeterminacy of the situation 
related to the adversary, and the unambiguity of the parameters 
flowing from the mission content, which may be accepted in the 
capacity of starting data for modelling. 
  Consequently, it appears possible to specifically and in 
detail determine the procedures for the takeoff of subunits, 
their movement to the points of engagement or to the "hunt" 
region, and the tactical techniques of the search, i.e., 
everything that the pilots do before they encounter the 
adversary. As for further actions, the higher the level of 
indeterminacy of the actions, the less strict and detailed the 
modelling should be. Such a variable level of modelling, in 
terms of level of preciseness, at different stages of planning a 
combat flight, which flows from the specificity of foresight, is 
evident in itself, and does not arouse particular objections. 
  "But what if I know everything about the adversary?" a 
persistent reader may ask. "Can't you then avoid spreading 
yourself too thin on numerous situations, and stay with one, and 
construct one, precise model of the upcoming actions? For 
example, I am given a simple mission using a flight to intercept 
a non-maneuvering target, whose characteristics and altitude 
have already been reliably established at the command post 
controlling the fighters." 
  Answering this question, let us accept such an assumption 
(even if it is extremely dubious) and let's see if the other 
conditions for accomplishment of the mission are so unshakable 
that one can restrict oneself to a single model. You of course 
will allow for information about the adversary, the terrain, and 
weather, and in accordance with the combat capabilities of one's 
flight (and that you will know thoroughly), and you will 
construct an appropriate model. It goes without saying that if 
the airborne complex and weapons allow an attack on the target 
in the forward hemisphere, you will choose the most favorable 
from among possible conditions -- closure with the adversary 
head to head, when it is not necessary to conduct a visual 
search which burdens pilot attention. 
  But why do you refrain from other variants in modelling a 
battle, even with an adversary known to you? After all, the 
not-so-unexpected might happen, and instead of a long-range 
battle, you might be forced to fight a close-range air-to-air 
battle. And when there is a close-range battle, you have to seek 
the target with your eyes. There are many reasons for this: 
errors in calculation of the CP and the pilots themselves, 
retargeting of the fighters, etc. Such are the moments of 
reckoning for a single model! 
  In forecasting the conditions for accomplishment of an 
at-first-glance simple combat mission, you selected the most 
possible situation from your standpoint, and discarded the less 
possible (but not impossible!). And among them are those which 
radically change the nature of actions of the fighters. Thus it 
would be illogical to limit oneself to structuring of one model 
even with the uncompromising conviction that "I know everything 
about the adversary," just as with regard to the other "known" 
factors, including friendly combat capabilities, interrelated 
with and inseparable from other conditions of the situation. 
  An element of indeterminacy is a vital, fundamental property 
of almost any air situation, and the degree of this 
indeterminacy may be very high. But it seems to me that in this 
case there are not and cannot be circumstances and factors which 
were not predicted at all; only the specificity of the foresight 
will be different. It may be only in general outlines, but one 
must predict everything. But if it is impossible to obtain 
reliable data for sound conclusions, one must assess the 
situation as a whole with allowance from multi-variant 
development of the situation. 
  However not only the indeterminacy of the situation has its 
affect on the number of modeled situations. After all, it often 
happens that even in similar situations one can operate in 
different ways. Using the terminology of cybernetics, one can 
say that one and the same event may be displayed by different 
models. They will all enjoy equal rights. But the situation 
forces one to arrive at a quite specific decision. Here one 
cannot manage without volitional qualities, without experience 
and intuition of the commander. 
  Nonetheless, one can clarify a certain law-governed 
regularity in the relation of the foundation of calculation to 
that of will. Let us recall the simple and wise popular saying: 
"Measure seven times, cut once." Rephrasing it, we can say, 
"Calculate seven times, decide once." For all the provisional 
nature of this formula, it is quite apropos here. The foundation 
of calculation (7:1) in modelling is given a clear preference. 
And the commander with his assistants carefully and repeatedly 
calculates all the details of the battle. 
  As a result of repeated, two-sided modelling of tactical 
situations, they may be reduced to several variants of battle 
and for each of them characteristic, specific attributes have 
been distinguished. How then to select that variant which makes 
it possible to perform the assigned mission in the best way? Of 
course, by comparison. There is no other way of selecting the 
variant; here there are many things unclear. 
  The main question is, How may we compare the variants with 
one another and draw a conclusion in favor of one or another of 
the variants? Everything depends on the goals which must be 
achieved by the fighters in accomplishing the given combat 
mission. One need only select the corresponding indices. 
Unreliable indices are like a compass which confuses us, and 
draws us off course. If the goal of the battle is formulated 
wrongly, then the searches for an optimal variant, headed in the 
wrong direction, may lead to an attempt to achieve secondary 
goals. 
  For example, in an air-to-air battle when providing troop 
protection, one of the indices will be the mathematical 
expectation of the number of targets destroyed by the fighters. 
However one cannot but allow for where they will be destroyed 
relative to friendly troops (the adversary should not have time 
to launch a strike) and at what cost the success will be 
achieved, i.e., what friendly losses will be. When the planes 
are supported by other arms of aviation, the indices are 
different: the degree of protection of the defended planes, the 
number of attacks repulsed, and also friendly losses. The 
mathematical expectation of the number of downed fighters of the 
adversary has secondary importance. In actions against ground 
targets in aerial reconnaissance, other indices have decisive 
importance. 
  The contradictory nature of all of these indices does not 
allow us to find the best (optimal) variant simultaneously in 
terms of each of them. Thus one must have an integral index of 
effectiveness, i.e., one which allows for the attainment of all 
goals. Here one of the indices should be taken as the main one, 
and the rest are given the value of limitations, especially the 
index of friendly losses. This index directs one to cheerless 
thoughts. Plan the death of pilots ahead of time? What's the 
sense of this? No, not plan, but minimize the index. The 
possibility of great losses not only does not permit, it 
directly forbids acknowledgement of a battle variant as 
advisable if even in the stage of development it threatens the 
fighters with significant harm. Consequently, any battle variant 
must have a precisely set goal and meet the strict requirements 
of every combat mission. Universal variants do not exist. 
  Of course, in using battle variants, however many there may 
be, it is impossible to allow for all the variety of the air 
situation, but they do create indisputable advantages for the 
commander. 
  Let us suppose that in planning a battle you have decided to 
have in the battle formation of the squadron both decoy elements 
and strike elements, and also a reserve element to protect the 
first two, and intend for buildup of efforts in the battle. Does 
this mean that such a disposition of forces is always retained 
when battle is joined? No, the pilots must be ready to change 
roles. It is best for that element to attack the adversary which 
is in the most favorable position. It may happen that the 
reserve is the first to join battle. Then the other elements 
must immediately reform for its protection, or for execution of 
a decoy maneuver. There may also be other situations, but 
pre-planned variants give the pilots the possibility of finding 
their bearings more confidently in the situation, more quickly 
seeing the chances for success, and psychologically reorienting 
themselves. 
  And so we conclude that multi-variant planning of battle 
makes it possible to obtain precise quantitative estimates and 
foresee the results of battle on the basis of two-sided 
modelling. This conclusion does not give grounds for excessive 
optimism. If we were to model certain air-to-air battles of the 
Great Patriotic War, for example, from the mathematical and even 
logical estimates, they will not fit into the generally accepted 
indices. However, these battles desire our admiration. A bold 
group of seven fighters under the command of Major B. Yeremin 
joined battle with 25 fascist planes, and after downing eight of 
them, gained the victory; Captain A. Gorovets destroyed nine 
bombers in just one battle. Thus the models of those battles, 
formulated in the heads of the front-line troops, allowed for 
still other factors. In those days there were also many 
unsuccessful battles, whose modelling today would give higher 
results. 
  Unfortunately, today we cannot allow for everything, no 
matter how complex the mathematical techniques to which we try 
to reduce the battle variant. No mathematical apparatus, no 
computer can eliminate or even discover errors of tactical 
thinking. Therefore, to repose vain hopes, and blindly believe 
in the force of models, is simply harmful. The development of 
battle variants is not exhausted by the intricacies of 
modelling, and does not completely fit in the framework of even 
complex calculations. They only reinforce tactical thinking with 
precise quantitative estimates. 
  However let us recall the place of the volitional foundation 
in modelling, and the ratio of 7:1. The dialectic of development 
of battle variants is such that despite will, experience and 
intuition of the commander, strict calculations come first. But 
how impatient we are at times in our desire to obtain the final 
results! Do we allow for untested, doubtful data and details, or 
only the most visible surface attributes of situations, do we 
strive to control the uncontrollable urge to "cut" immediately, 
without any calculations, simply on the basis of common sense, 
"by eye"? 
<H5>  3. How Many Tactical Techniques? </H5>
  This question might sound strange, but it arises in the 
commander and his pilots each time in planning an air-to-air 
battle. In order to answer it, first let us consider what we 
want to get from the tactical technique. 
  Any tactical technique should correspond to the general 
concept of the battle, allow for the expected actions and 
tactical tricks of the adversary, allow its executors rapid and 
even instantaneous determination of the appropriateness of a 
particular, planned tactical procedure for the developing 
specific situation in the course of battle. It is still 
necessary to achieve covertness of actions in order to outwit 
the adversary. The necessary requirements for a tactical 
technique are the possibility of its development by several 
variants in battle, and simplicity of execution. Of course, it 
has nothing in common with stubborn straightforwardness, and 
entails abandonment of far-fetched complications which would 
require useless expenditure of forces to overcome. Nor should we 
forget about reliable protection from attack by enemy fighters, 
which requires allocation of part of the forces, or of tactical 
and fire coordination in groups. 
  This list of requirements is a kind of methodological 
approach to development of tactical techniques, and it may be 
viewed from the standpoint of assessment of their "tactical 
cost." Unfortunately, real battle gives the true price of the 
technique, but fortunately, the tactical attainments of the 
adversary are also subordinate to this same criterion. 
  Is the variety of tactical techniques large? Yes, there are 
quite many, and this is necessary to provide the pilots with a 
choice of a rational one in the conditions of indeterminacy of 
the air situation. Such a situation may develop as a result of 
actions of the adversary, changes in the weather, and other 
circumstances which cannot be unequivocally determined ahead of 
time. Here resides all the complexity of the question. Even in 
one and the same situation, several variants may be found, while 
sometimes the tactical technique may prove to be the one. 
Therefore the number of tactical techniques in itself says 
nothing. If failure befalls you, this means that the technique 
did not correspond to the situation, or was poorly executed. 
  However, in arguing about the number of tactical techniques, 
at times we meet the statement that (having) many tactical 
techniques is good, and having few is bad. Is there an index of 
quality of tactics? Will it not happen that in the search for 
new techniques we will operate by the slogan "Let it be worse, 
as long as it's different"? There should not be stagnation in 
tactics, but this does not mean that everything new is ingenious. 
  Imagine that when closing with a maneuvering target you have 
applied an original tactical technique, but its results are 
worse in comparison with some already known, you attacked a 
target using a new technique, but it entailed a hazard to flight 
safety. Should such tactical innovations be encouraged? There is 
much innovation, but what is the ultimate result? After all, it 
is determined not by the degree of innovation of the tactical 
technique, but by the effectiveness of accomplishment of the 
combat mission. However much a pilot may wax sarcastic about the 
cliche nature of already known tactical techniques, a situation 
in which the race for quantity becomes an end itself is already 
bad. 
  They say that the great scientist Einstein once was making a 
note in his little notebook. Answering a question from those 
around him, he said that he was writing down his thoughts. 
  "Why such a little notebook then?" asked one curious person. 
  "Because good thoughts don't occur to one that often," the 
scientist replied with a smile. 
  There it is! And sometimes we try everything we can to think 
up yet another tactical technique, so that we have a lot of 
them, we fill up thick workbooks, and later on we ourselves 
can't understand the notes. But on the other hand, you won't go 
far repeating customary tactical techniques. There is a rule in 
pedagogy that simple repetition, regardless of the number of 
repetitions, only strengthens skills, but does not bring 
perfection. This is also the case in tactics, in unthinking 
repetition of the same mechanical tactical techniques. 
  Modern tactical techniques of fighters have achieved a high 
level of sophistication. Sometimes it appears that tactics has 
entered a period in which everything that can be improved has 
already been improved, and some sort of tactical ceiling has 
been reached, which it makes no sense to go beyond. Is this the 
case? 
  Once upon a time a young pilot in the circle of his comrades 
expressed the interesting idea that, as he put it, the time of 
creativity in the search for tactical techniques had disappeared 
along with the piston aircraft and subsonic speeds. Now they 
must not learn creativity, but execute the flight program and 
the commands from the ground. All of his actions were 
programmed, all the tasks were carried out by "smart" 
instruments. Those were the work of Chkalov's day, when new 
methods of attack were in stormy development, and high aerobatic 
maneuvers were being developed! 
  Yes, Valeriy Chkalov improved the existing and searched for 
new methods of using his aviation equipment and weapons. He was 
not satisfied by the existing views, according to which a target 
could be attacked only from conventional horizontal flight. 
Despite the established rules, he proposed and developed other 
variants of attack, including the delivery of fire with the 
aircraft "on its back," and for the first time in the world 
executed maneuvers such as the "slow roll" and the "climbing 
spin." Precisely these maneuvers were used later on in vertical 
maneuver combat which became dominant among Soviet fighters 
during the Great Patriotic War. Chkalov's contemporaries were 
always struck by his erudition, his knowledge of aerodynamics 
and the equipment which he flew, and his creative attitude 
toward his job. 
  Indisputably, present-day aviation equipment is incomparable 
with the equipment of the thirties, which Chkalov mastered, but 
have Chkalov's times ended? No, creativity in tactics cannot 
disappear from our profession. What is more, the diversity of 
tactical techniques characterizes the pilot, determines his 
style, his signature. 
  Creativity is the accomplishment of non-typical tasks, the 
creation of the new and original. Creativity of the fighter 
pilot is of a special sort. It is subordinate to the mission of 
destruction of the air adversary, and under the conditions which 
are complex and hard-to-predict. It is expressed not only in the 
creation of tactical techniques which are new in concept and 
execution, but also in their capable selection from a group of 
those already existing. This means that the nature of the new in 
tactics is such that it often is born in the core of the old. 
  Before we move forward, it is necessary to comprehensively 
consider what has been accumulated, with allowance for the 
requirements of today. There is truth to the joke that "The new 
is the long-forgotten old." Thus tactical techniques of group 
maneuver battle, sharpened to perfection at the front, and 
forgotten in the 50s, later on were reborn on a new foundation; 
the cannon fire, once consigned to oblivion, blazes again in 
air-to-air conflict. 
  Of course the importance of experience of bygone wars is not 
all the same: it was greater in the first postwar years, when 
basically the equipment of the concluding period of the war was 
in the armament of fighter aviation, and less in the subsequent 
period, with transition to new equipment and with the 
introduction of correctives to the theory of the air-to-air 
battle. Nonetheless, we continue to study the experience of 
bygone wars and exercises, and we seek in them the answers to 
problems of present-day battle, and try to avoid the repetition 
of errors. 
  We proceed to the new in tactics also through hard pondering 
of today's experience, we study the capabilities of modern 
equipment, we "probe" the tactics of the adversary, we collect 
crumb-by-crumb everything interesting which is occurring in the 
practice of the best pilots. Alas veins of gold are not 
everything discovered -- tactical techniques are not put in our 
hands ready-made, but this by no means diminishes the importance 
of the question. 
  However, it is apropos to recall that blind copying of 
something, even the best experience, does not replace the 
personal touch. Look carefully at one's practice and you will 
most likely find that you can add something to tactics. This may 
be, for example, a different combination of practiced piloting 
situations, or unexpected changes in simple maneuvers, in the 
models of battle. Even the experienced enemy may become 
flustered in the face of such changes. After all, he may have to 
change an adopted decision under a time shortage, and this is a 
quite complex process. On the basis of personal experience, new 
ideals open up, and thought is spurred. It is impossible to 
learn to fight a battle only on the basis of others' attainments 
and errors. 
  How then are new tactical techniques born? The search in 
tactics cannot be boiled down to some sort of accidental 
enlightenment, a flash of intuition, although this might happen 
in battle. The search begins on the ground, in the preparation 
for flight. It begins with development and accumulation of 
battle variants. Here calculation, repeated modelling, tests and 
playing out of variants, comprehensive testing of the obtained 
models, their necessary practical application. In discussing 
variants of battle, pilots due to the essence of a particular 
situation, learn to soundly prove the essence of their arguments 
(truth is born out of controversy). This makes it possible 
"roughly" to be ready for actions in the air. There remains only 
to link the arising situation, from a certain number of traits, 
to a prepared tactical technique, and the habit of thinking 
creatively ensures rapid determination of the technique which is 
optimal for the given situation. 
  At the same time, new tactical techniques often are born 
directly in battles, with unexpected changes in the situation. 
Nonetheless, if the pilot does not model a variant similar to 
such changes on the ground, in the air he will find himself in a 
very difficult situation. Hard mental labor aimed at foreseeing 
possible situations will always promote creativity in the air. 
  But then even now some theorists believe that better has to 
mean more complicated. In the race after new tactical 
techniques, they solve tough mathematical equations, operate 
with many indices relating various characteristics of friendly 
and enemy planes, but they do not allow for the living human 
being, the pilot. Knowledge is transformed into dogma, 
methodical approaches become law, a distinctive, 
hard-to-understand terminology is formed. 
  It seems to me that tactics constitutes techniques which are 
simple in their essence, but hard for the adversary to puzzle 
out in detail. And probably there is nothing more reasonable 
than the sense of harmony between the complexity of concept of 
the tactical technique and its practical feasibility. Tactical 
techniques arise out of the need for them. If we perceive this 
need, and it does not disappear when some other technique is 
used, that means that we need another, more effective one. To 
develop truly necessary tactical techniques requires sound 
theoretical knowledge and modelling skills, but that is not 
enough. In battle there is no one you can describe your 
knowledge and skills to, and no point to doing so. You also need 
the desire to seek out the new in tactics, to find in it the you 
of creativity, to view it not as something extraordinary, but as 
an indispensable trait of the pilot profession. 
  There is a widely-shared viewpoint that the new and 
progressive will inevitably, sooner or later win out, will fight 
its way through. Perhaps we simply are not aware of the fate of 
those tactical innovations which did not win out. What destroyed 
them? Passivity of the pilots, the resistance to change of the 
leaders, the impatience with "dissidence" in tactics in the 
period of stagnation? 
  Imagine that you are preparing for an air-to-air battle, 
possessing exhaustive information on the adversary, who is not 
expected to put up serious resistance. Are special tactical 
devices required under such testing range conditions, so to 
speak, in order to achieve victory? Here open actions, in which 
there is no place for improvement of tactics, are natural and 
logical, but the unsoundness of such actions is also evident. 
  Here is another example, when despite the complex situation 
and the boldness of the pilots in their tactical decisions, the 
baggage of knowledge accumulated over long years, the experience 
of the senior officer plans the role of a conservative force and 
prevents looking at the tactics in a new way. In one squadron, 
during preparation for the next evaluation testing, they decided 
to shine before the higher command with a new tactical 
technique, which significantly raised the effectiveness of 
intercept of air targets. How much effort, time, and thought was 
expended to develop it, only the pilots themselves know! It was 
all calculated and tested, but... when the senior officer, now a 
former officer, was acquainted with this technique, he 
categorically forbade using it, and even accused the squadron 
commander of adventurism. 
  "Why should we risk something new and difficult?" the 
officer 
reasons. "All the actions of the pilots are written out in the 
governing documents," he stated, feeling no embarrassment. "Just 
follow the instructions as required, and nothing else." 
  Of course by no means every technique must be encouraged, 
but 
it is necessary to look into it, so as not to discourage 
creativity. Of course the following sortie to intercept a 
hypothetical adversary, known to be weak, to top it off, was 
successful, but if one can put it thus, it was reminiscent of a 
woodcut of a blue, cloudless landscape, the embodiment of a 
problem-free situation. 
  The squadron commander bent over his desk and thoughtfully 
examined the separate models of the upcoming battle. Both he and 
his colleagues had two variants: one the usual, which the pilots 
often used, the other more complex, since it was associated with 
energetic maneuvering, and required high flying proficiency, but 
promised the greater success. 
  It would seem that the commander had no reason to ponder for 
long, that the conclusion was more than obvious: he had to 
operate by the second variant. But the commander could not 
forget the unsuccessful example of his neighboring squadron and 
had good grounds for doubt. The two developed variants of the 
battle he saw as two paths: the first was off road, untraveled, 
in which there were more chances of error, the second was well 
worn, one might say "classical" in its simplicity. The 
all-justifying call to remember only flight safety was a 
reliable shield for the second variant. After all, in the event 
of failure the commander would again be accused of adventurism, 
excessive independence. And he chose the second, well-worn path. 
Who likes to be told off, with no attention paid to those around 
him? 
  "Nothing doing," the squadron commander waved aside his 
creativity, opting for a calm course of service. "Am I smarter 
than the others? Better not to tempt fate." And he set off to 
assign the mission to his subordinates. 
  I won't undertake to say the mood with which the pilots 
greeted the decision of their commander, but it would appear 
that they were not especially upset. 
  "It's typical phoniness" the reader will probably snap, and 
he would be right. 
  I too got mad, and when the pilots returned to the air 
field, 
I went up to them and inquired how the battle had gone. Some 
spoke of the easy victory over the "adversary" and were happy at 
the success, others argued that they did not have to make any 
maneuvers for secrecy or swiftness of attack. The squadron 
commander without a shadow of embarrassment in his voice, as if 
he were speaking of practicing some elements of combat 
application, answered me: 
  "What is this about? After all, everything is hypothetical 
in 
our training, and we did win the battle. Anyway, I don't 
understand why we need these training complications." Here, no 
longer concealing his irritation, the officer continued (the 
well-worn path did its work), "Let a real war come, then we'll 
show the enemy what we can do. Anyway, why are you interested in 
this case? That's the way it will be tomorrow and the day after." 
  I explain my interest: it's better to suffer a defeat in a 
training battle today, but to gain the new experience which will 
bring victory in the future. Of course one can cling for some 
time to general words of the dubiousness of using complex 
tactical techniques in combat training, and of the remote 
aspects of a real battle. But there it will be different, if you 
select and use a good tactical technique, you will save yourself 
and your comrades, and win a victory, if you don't, then blame 
yourself, as they say. 
  There are not many such cases in the experience of combat 
training now, but the cost of each of them is very high. False 
opinions have appeared suggesting that creativity in tactics is 
the domain of the select, a mystery behind seven seals, a gift 
of the gods. But in fact, any thinking person is capable of 
creativity, and what is more, can learn creativity. This is why 
we seek out new tactical techniques again and again. 
  How many tactical techniques should one have? Ten, twelve, a 
hundred? Sometimes it seems that they may be counted, especially 
if the types of aircraft, the numerical strength of the 
adversary, the place and other conditions of the battle are 
known. 
  Flight commander Capt. Ye. Kaberov, knowing these 
conditions, 
together with his pilots developed a battle plan in detail. They 
selected and calculated standard tactical techniques of battle; 
they seemingly covered all tactical situations of the flight. 
But the unexpected happened: whether the "adversary" received 
precise information from the ground, or whether he himself used 
some technique unknown to the flight commander, the latter 
detected him too close, on a pursuit intercept course, and 
significantly lower. When the "enemy" planes flashed by to the 
left under him, the captain realized that if he structured a 
maneuver for turn to attack by the whole flight, as envisaged in 
preparation for battle, he would lose the initiative. He 
required another tactical technique, but precisely one which 
would correspond to the situation. To the commander's credit, he 
did not lose his head. 
  "Six-hundred thirty, attack!" the officer ordered the leader 
of the second pair, which was behind in a more favorable 
position for the attack. 
  "Six-hundred thirty," understanding the commander's intent, 
executed an energetic turn to the right and delivered an 
accurate strike. The commander with his wingman supplemented the 
force of the strike. The battle was won. 
  "The hundred-and-first tactical technique," joked the 
pilots, 
assembling after landing. "How many tactical techniques do you 
have to have?" 
  "Just as many as you need in different situations," answered 
Kaberov. And you have to agree with that answer. Perhaps you 
won't have to improvise in every battle, but you always have to 
know how to find the tactics which were not envisaged in the 
battle plan. The main thing here is to precisely determine the 
situation from which one can proceed to selection of a suitable 
technique. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  And so preparation for battle is concluded. The battle plan 
has been drawn up and studied. The commander is certain that 
each pilot knows where to go and what to do. Everyone is intent 
on victory. It goes without saying that it will depend not just 
on the hopes of the commander. It would of course be nice to 
fight a battle if it were waged only under the condition that 
the battle plans were flawless, and the tactical techniques 
promised every chance of success. There are no such chances, 
there is a pitched battle, in which not everything shown in the 
plan is precisely repeated. 
  The method of trial and error always entails great losses. 
For every error in battle planning one must pay not the low 
costs of an exercise, but human lives. Painstaking battle 
planning in variants, based on profound foresight, a group of 
prepared and practiced tactical techniques, and a readiness for 
action in unexpected situations, these are what the pilot needs 
first of all, when battle breaks out. 
<H5>  Chapter VI. So As to Win in Battle </H5>
<H5>  1. Fully Utilize the Capabilities of the Weapons </H5>
  I shall begin with a fact which is well known to pilots. You 
take off to intercept an air target. After receiving information 
from the CP about its characteristic, height and distance, you 
mull it over and seek out an appropriate variant of battle, 
developed before the sortie and promising the greatest success, 
you compare your capabilities with the capabilities of the 
adversary. If your plane has greater speed, you will be able to 
intercept the adversary more quickly, catch up with him or at 
the most critical moment break away from pursuit; if your 
maneuver characteristics are better, you can more effectively 
conduct the maneuver battle; if your weapons are better, you can 
hit the target more accurately, and from farther away. 
  This truth today requires serious augmentation. The fact is 
that it is not all that easy to completely utilize the high 
potential capabilities of present-day aviation equipment. In 
flying a high-speed aircraft, one cannot go beyond the limits of 
the existing limitations. But if a pilot wants to go beyond 
these limits, he does so in modes which are close to critical 
and cannot execute an energetic maneuver for attack or evasion 
of a strike. At such moments he must fight not with the enemy, 
but with his aircraft. The fear of violating safety measures 
forces the pilots to pay more attention to maintaining various 
flight modes, and limits the maneuver capabilities of the 
fighters. The zones where he is allowed to launch missiles are 
strictly regulated, so working with the sight, and tracking 
while observing the set launch parameters, demand a great deal 
of attention. In the past the high effectiveness of utilization 
of airborne machineguns and cannon was achieved by firing at 
maximally short range. Today the spectrum of firing distances is 
quite wide, and such an approach is completely inapplicable to 
missile launches. 
  Consequently, however surprising and remarkable the 
capabilities that fighters may posses, they may remain unused 
under difficult battle conditions. This is why the attainment of 
maximal effectiveness, i.e., complete use of the capabilities of 
aviation equipment, has today become an independent and no less 
complex problem than that of the development of new models. 
  For example, at your disposal you have various types of 
missiles, and a cannon, and you have to use this mighty armament 
in a group, and differently in different battle situations. 
  First of all, you have to correctly choose the moment of the 
start of utilization and the transition from one type of weapon 
to another. It is determined by the direction of attack, the 
speed of closure with the adversary, the distance to him, and 
the expected countermeasures. 
  Second, it is necessary to create the most favorable 
conditions for the use of the selected weapons. Thus for missile 
launch at a given hemisphere of a maneuvering target, the 
fighter must as a rule be in the range of missile fire. When 
firing with the cannon, it is better to be on the inside of the 
enemy maneuver. 
  Third, one should select the sight in a timely manner 
(radar, 
optical) for the developing battle conditions. 
  Fourth, it is necessary to precisely determine the optimal 
ranges and the moments of missile launch and fire with the 
cannon, which will depend on the target aspect, nature of its 
maneuver, and other conditions of the attack. 
  From even a simple enumeration of pilot actions, it is clear 
that you have to know a lot, and be capable of much in order to 
fully utilize the capabilities of your weapons for a surprise 
and swift attack on the adversary, who in turn will undertake 
everything in order to destroy the fighter or evade a strike. 
  Of course the pilots of all generations wanted to fully 
utilize the capabilities of their weapons, but they went about 
it in different ways. It is interesting to have a look at how 
this was done in the past, and how it is done today. 
  On 12 April 1943, in the skies over Kuban, squadron 
commander 
A. Pokryshkin (later on a Marshal of Aviation, a triple hero of 
the Soviet Union), who was with his squadron in its alert zone, 
was radioed from the command post the mission of intercepting a 
group of enemy planes. In order to increase the power-to-weight 
ratio of their fighters, the pilots while still in expectation 
of battle, had flown in the zone by the "rocking cradle" or 
"swinging watch" method: altitude, swift descent over a given 
region, making it possible to develop high speed, and high speed 
allowing a rapid gain to the necessary altitude to deliver 
surprise strikes on the adversary. In addition the battle 
formation of the squadron was vertically separated with 200-300 
m between pairs and 600-800 m between wings. Therefore, at the 
moment that the intercept mission was received, the squadron had 
an undoubted advantage in power-to-weight ratio over the 
adversary, although the tactical performance characteristics of 
the planes of the sides were roughly equal. In this battle the 
enemy did not number more than eight planes, and our fighters 
had no losses. The success of the battle was determined not so 
much by personal bravery as by the ability of the commander and 
pilots to ably utilize the capabilities of their weapons. Here 
the famous Pokryshkin motto, suitable for any battle, was fully 
evident: "altitude - speed - maneuver - fire," which clearly 
substantiated the close connection of all elements, determining 
the degree of realization of the weapon capabilities. 
  Almost a half century later, pilot first class Captain 
Tsibin 
took off to intercept an air target, a radio-controlled target. 
We will compare these two episodes, separated by such a 
significant interval of time. One occurred at war, the other in 
the course of tactical flight training. What do they have in 
common? After all, Tsibin's fighter was far more sophisticated 
than the fighters from the war years. But upon comparing the 
episodes, we see that as in a mirror they reflect one and the 
same ability of the pilots to fully utilize the capabilities of 
their weapons. 
  The radio-controlled target was still lurking far off 
somewhere, when Capt. Tsibin received the first commands from 
the CP: bearing, altitude, weather in the region of action was 
bad. Lower edge of clouds was 300 m, haze, and the target was 
protected by jamming, was maneuvering to foil interception on 
this overcast day. For the target, what was bad visibility, what 
was, as the pilot's say, a "million by a million," there was no 
difference. It would cut turns at any G forces, as much as the 
control surfaces would allow. The operator would not black out; 
he was on the ground. 
  Tsibin clearly saw the importance and the complexity of 
executing the mission, and allowed for the maneuver 
characteristics of his own plane and the target. He knew that 
whether or not the so-desired target return would appear on his 
scope, against the jamming background, would depend on his 
considered maneuver, on the correct handling of the sight. In 
executing the commands sent to his plane from the CP, and not 
taking his eyes from the sight scope, Tsibin concentrated his 
attention on piloting the plane and seeking the target. The 
"adversary" maneuvered energetically, never ceasing the jamming, 
but the electronic ring shone with the numbers of the 
provisional code. The distance to the target diminished swiftly. 
In the course of several tens of seconds the pilot had to 
perform numerous necessary actions with the controls of the 
plane, the sight, and the weapons. Each movement was calculated 
precisely. The engine rpm, maintenance of the target return on 
the screen, all was aimed at executing a devastating attack. 
Before his eyes the signal light flashed, indicating that the 
pilot had entered the launch zone. Without taking his eyes from 
the sight, he pushed the launch button, and the missile broke up 
the thick gloom with the flame of an explosion. The target was 
destroyed. 
  On the ground they asked Tsibin what he would have done if 
the target was not destroyed by the missile strike. The pilot 
answered that in that case he would have immediately switched 
the armament system to cannon fire immediately after the launch, 
and prepared it for battle. Like Burnozyan in the remote wartime 
past, in this flight the officer demonstrated the ability to use 
his weapons in difficult situations. 
  In those same live fires, one of the pilots was vectored to 
the target at a difficult aspect angle (the CP crew erred) and 
another had a defect in his sight (for reasons beyond his 
control). It occurred to each that the developing situation gave 
them the right to turn back, but they immediately rejected it: 
what about accomplishing the mission? The pilots did not lose 
their heads. Each demonstrated enviable speed of reaction, 
correctly analyzed the developing situation, and successfully 
attacked the assigned target. The first using an original 
maneuver, the second by finding the cause of the failure and 
using a different operating mode of the sight. Indisputably if 
the pilots had not known the capabilities of their weapons well, 
if they had not mastered them to perfection and were not 
trained, they would not have been ready to perform under these 
unexpected conditions. 
  There is no need to explain that the more difficult and 
multifaceted the weapons, the greater the probability of 
erroneous actions. If there is an inadequately trained pilot in 
the fighter cockpit, his slightest error or incompetence becomes 
immediately evident. 
  In those same live fires, after landing, a fighter taxied to 
the fueling zone with his missiles unfired on their launchers. 
Everyone wondered why the pilot had not fired. An unexpected 
equipment failure, unsuccessful guidance from the CP? The 
officer himself confirmed their doubts. Blaming the jamming, he 
reported to the commander that he had detected the target a 
little later than required, so that he had no time to aim. In 
fact everyone understood that the officer did not have the 
knowledge and skills to operate the sight under jamming 
conditions. 
  But here is the interesting part. When I asked the pilot why 
Captain Tsibin had downed a target under the same conditions, I 
heard in response: "Just luck. The captain lucked out!" 
  But those who know Tsibin corrected the officer. Behind his 
flight lay the faultless knowledge of his weapons, and long hard 
work. Ultimately good luck is very discriminating, it gives its 
preference only to the worthy. Most likely the officer himself 
knew this, but he did not want to acknowledge his errors. 
  In his attack of the air target the young pilot developed 
high speed, did not maintain the set parameters of missile 
launch, and they went wide of the mark, another in flight acted 
hastily, was nervous and forgot to turn on one of the weapons 
switches, so that the launch did not occur at all. The cause was 
one and the same: both were not adequately trained, both were 
undone by inept actions with the controls and sight. How then 
could they maximally utilize the capabilities of their weapons! 
  These errors are especially perceptible if it is not a lone 
fighter going into battle, but a whole subunit. Do not think, 
dear reader, that the combat capabilities of the group is the 
arithmetic sum of the capabilities of the fighters making it up. 
No, they are greater than this sum, to the extent that the 
pilots, controlled by the uniform will of the leader, have 
mastered the tactics of multiple-aircraft air-to-air battle, the 
ability to build up their general capabilities with high 
personal proficiency, and to artfully interact in battle. 
Tactical and fire interaction in the group by far increases its 
combat might and reduces the possibility of surprise attacks by 
the adversary, even ruling it out if vigilance is high. 
  I have had occasion to hear the following remark by a young 
pilot: 
  "What do I have to do as the wingman? You go to the left, 
look to the right, go to the right, look to the left at the 
leader. The main thing is not to lose him, not to break up the 
battle formation, and follow the commands." 
  I would advise the pilot: look at yourself through the prism 
of combat experience, read the memoirs. It shows there how 
pilots died when they thought in just that happy-go-lucky 
fashion. Of course you're not supposed to violate the battle 
formation. Wartime experience shows that if the wingmen forgot 
this and abandoned their leaders, got caught up in the chase for 
individual enemy planes, and even downed them, they badly let 
down their leaders, and often were themselves shot down. 
Therefore the initiative and independence of the wingmen is to 
some extent limited. 
  Let us ask ourselves: in the present-day air-to-air battle, 
can one fully realize the capabilities of the group's weapons if 
the wingmen only passively hold their places in the battle 
formation, if their role does not go beyond the framework of 
blind copying of the actions of the leader and his planes? No, 
something else comes to the fore here: the capacity of each 
pilot to masterfully attack the adversary at any moment at the 
orders of his commander, to quickly and accurately follow the 
instructions given to him, to be read to assume responsibility 
for successful accomplishment of the whole mission. This 
requires something else entirely: the ability to look at the 
place occupied in the battle formation not only with one's own 
eyes, but with the eyes of the leader, to understand one's role 
in attainment of the ultimate result of battle. And then the 
wingman will truly "get into" the actions of the group. 
Narrowness of tactical thinking and lack of initiative will 
never result in anything good. 
  Each successive generation of fighters acquires better and 
better tactical performance characteristics, contains in itself 
elements of fundamental scientific and technical innovation, 
contains many undiscovered, still-hidden combat capabilities. 
However there is a serious obstacle on the path to their combat 
utilization: some characteristics and combat properties of the 
fighters are already reaching a practical limit, determined not 
by the qualities of the planes, but by the physical capabilities 
of the pilots. 
  The new-generation fighters are characterized by G forces 
which are much greater, and more importantly, have a longer 
duration and higher rate of buildup. Even trained pilots can 
withstand high G forces only for a short time, to the detriment 
of observation of the situation in the course of battle. In 
addition the growing angular velocities of maneuver result in an 
overload of the pilot's vestibular apparatus, and he has a very 
hard time controlling the spatial position of his aircraft 
during prolonged maneuvering. And at low altitudes, the maximal 
flight speed becomes higher than that at which it is still 
possible to safely fly the aircraft and conduct visual 
orientation in direct proximity to the ground. 
  The difficulties associated with the high of 
high-performance 
aircraft naturally are supplemented by the profusion of 
instrumental data, the increase in the necessary operating speed 
with the piloting and navigation apparatus, the aircraft control 
systems and weapons. The capacity to find one's bearings in the 
numerous dials, instruments and scopes, the attentiveness, 
memory and other mental and physiological capacities of the 
pilots also are approaching the limit of human capabilities. And 
all this in a single-seat fighter, where the pilot is deprived 
of the assistance of other crew members. He must observe the air 
space and at the same time look at the instruments. Otherwise, 
he might not notice when a small red light flashes in the 
cockpit, indicating say the start of a fire in the engine. In 
other words, with the expansion of equipment capabilities, 
battle has become more work-intensive. In a shorter time, it is 
necessary to perform more actions. This is when the 
contradiction arises that "The aircraft is capable, the pilot is 
not." 
  One cannot overlook this contradiction, or underestimate the 
importance of the problem. How can one reflect about the full 
utilization of the capabilities of equipment if they are greater 
than the capabilities of the man? To resolve the problem by 
improving the skills of known automatism, behind which lay long 
training sessions, exhausting labor, maximum exertion of 
strength and will? There is much being said now about the need 
to resolve this problem. The parameters of the problem exist and 
are susceptible to accounting, quite precise at that. Valuable 
statistical material has been accumulated. Nonetheless, research 
in this field has to this point not brought tangible results. 
  One can definitely say just one thing: the aircraft 
designers, scientists, all of us have work to do here. Here 
there is no way to manage without an understanding of how pilots 
perceive and assimilate information, without a serious, 
thoughtful approach to development of fundamentally new means of 
reducing the loads on the human being in executing maneuvers, 
and display devices to densify the data streams. 
  Aircraft designers strive to reduce to a minimum the harmful 
influence of G forces on the pilot, to improve the readability 
of the instruments, to reduce the number of switches. For 
example, on the prospective American ATF fighter there will be 
one tenth as many as on present-day fighters, and they will all 
be located to the side and on the chair of the pilot. The chair 
tilts to compensate for G forces, and the control stick is to 
the side, not blocking the view of the instruments. The 
designers want to ensure constant dosing of data in a volume 
which is optimal for its assimilation by the pilots, to replace 
apprising information with command information, which one need 
not think about, but immediately execute (target selection, 
method of attack, optimal maneuver). These functions are still 
not carried out by those low-power airborne automatic control 
systems which today are installed on planes. In addition they 
are not always linked: the algorithms of one cannot be 
understood by another. 
  The pilots understand the need to practice protective muscle 
and respiratory anti-overload techniques, special training 
sessions and self-monitoring of one's psycho-physiological 
state, and react positively to the ideas of reducing the 
instruments and switches in the cockpit, and to further 
automation of control, but they want to reserve for themselves 
the right of choice: when to fly in automatic mode, and when to 
intervene in this mode, to shift to manual control of the 
aircraft. 
  Have they paid attention to the width and the multiplicity 
of 
the problem? Let us try to analyze and note the ways of 
resolving it. If we sketch a circuit of tactical and engineer 
tasks flowing from our discussions, then in it one can 
distinguish two basic trends in developing of the "airborne 
brain" or onboard algorithms: 
  - control of the plane and weapons (let us call them the 
combat algorithms); 
  - development and realization of decisions for the 
air-to-air 
battle (these algorithms would logically be called tactical). 
  The combat algorithms, providing the pilot with automated 
piloting and navigation of the aircraft, optimizing maneuver, 
control of the zones of surveillance of the sights at launch, 
lockon of targets, aiming and other such actions, are a task of 
today which is successfully resolved in fourth-generation 
fighters. 
  Development of tactical algorithms is a new scientific 
trend. 
The issue is expert systems, allow the subunit commanders 
purposeful perception of data displayed on board the aircraft 
before and during battle for assessment of the situation and for 
decision-making. The software may include identification and 
grouping of air targets, selection of suitable maneuvers, battle 
formations and weapons type, determination of the expected 
results of attacks and other calculations. The commander is 
shown the general situation, including the jamming situation, 
some supplemental information, and is given recommendations 
regarding distribution of detected targets among the pilots, and 
tactical and fire interaction in the group, and then automated 
command and control of the battle is implemented. 
  Clearly no one need be convinced of the advantages which 
pilots and commanders will receive in the not so remote future 
when these wonderful creations will come to life and acquire 
real sense. There is a hope that even weakly trained pilots will 
have increased changes of victory in battle. This is why, 
without combat and tactical algorithms, without expert systems 
one cannot conceive of the construction of fifth-generation 
fighters. Preliminary studies, having to do with the feasibility 
of their development, have been conducted for more than one year 
now in different countries. There also exist quite realistic 
developments of "smart weapons." Suffice to say that the 
above-mentioned ATF fighter is supposed to have 20-30 expert 
systems, 10-12 of them tactical. 
  However, in order to go from suppositions to reality, one 
must also allow for another aspect. Today there are still no 
developed views of the problem as a whole, doubts are expressed 
concerning the tactical capabilities of its resolution, and 
differences of opinion remain with regard to approaches toward 
the practical significance of new algorithms. 
  But some military specialists may ask: Has not the role of 
the "airborne brain" been exaggerated, is not all this just 
another fashion, a theory not implemented in practice? To talk 
of resolving the problem is tantamount to not seeing, or not 
wanting to see the difficulties and obstacles which are still 
insuperable, the expenditures for development which are played 
down. 
  "The plane will become smarter than the pilot if these 
algorithms are developed," other specialists object. "Is this 
conceivable?" 
  The doubts are by no means indisputable. They have their own 
logic. Difficulties and uncertainties cannot be ignored. What 
does it mean to implement a tactical algorithm in practice? For 
expert evaluations of target importance, selection of rational 
tactical techniques, distribution of the fighter forces and many 
other elements making up the command decision, it is necessary 
to form a data bank regarding the adversary, friendly fighters 
and their capabilities, to classify some number of models and 
tactical situations (they were mentioned in the preceding 
chapter), and do it separately for close-in and long-range 
battle, and overcoming of enemy air defenses. And all this is a 
complex of extremely difficult problems for whose accomplishment 
it is impossible to propose universal reliable algorithms. But 
then, development of such intricate algorithms is a special 
topic, and I would like to return to today, to see the first 
steps in this field. 
  Let us look at a fourth-generation fighter, for example the 
Su-27. Just a few years ago hardly anyone could imagine that a 
commander leading his subordinates into battle in this plane 
would have an earlier unknown system for controlling them, that 
on the basis of between-plane radio-telemechanical 
communications, coming to him from wingmen would be concentrated 
on the tactical situation scope of his plane, and that he could 
transmit it to subordinates. You see, such an innovation gives 
command and control the nature of an ordered target distribution 
in group air-to-air combat. 
  It remains for us to express our opinion on the thesis that 
the plane is "smarter" than the pilot. Is that the case? The 
plane becomes not simply a weapon, but something different, an 
advisor, an assistant of the pilot. Thus only in combination 
with further improvement in piloting mastery and tactical 
proficiency may one fully utilize its high combat capabilities 
and realize the principle that "the plane can, and the pilot can 
too." 
<H5>  2. Stratagem Is Also a Weapon </H5>
  Recently I had occasion to be an unwilling participant in 
the 
following dialogue between two young pilots. 
  "What do you say about stratagem? They say that it can 
really 
save a pilot in battle." 
  "They don't say it -- they used to say it." 
  "We need it, but why?" 
  "I think that our brother fighters in the Great Patriotic 
War 
had it better. No ground or airborne radars, the adversary in 
full ignorance, and full scope for stratagem. I do not remember 
where I read it, perhaps at military school, that our glorious 
aces achieved victory by hiding in the sun, clouds, the dark 
side of the horizon. And now what? Whatever you say, the time of 
military stratagem is long past." 
  "What do you think? Our commanders says that stratagem is a 
weapon of the pilot." 
  "No, you listen to me: we live in an era of radar and 
electronics. Everything is different now. Judge for yourself, do 
you think you can sneak up on an enemy, with his continuous 
radar field? And the AWACS system? It will track each of your 
maneuvers even at low altitude. So how would you employ a 
stratagem?" 
  "I can't figure it out. So we have only straight-ahead, 
artless maneuvers? The real air warrior must catch the enemy 
unawares, force him to submit to a strike." 
  "Fine words, but what do they mean?" 
  "Well, for example, non-standard construction of battle 
formations, non-standard maneuvers, speed of closure, perhaps 
also... 
  "Hah! The adversary will discover your plane before you 
begin 
maneuvering, before you reach the area of possible attack. Do 
you think you're dealing with a fool who won't notice, or who 
will wait for your attack? 
  "You forget about jamming, electronic and fire suppression 
of 
enemy radars. 
  "You slipped up here too. Don't you understand, you 
`tactical 
giant' that no one will expend manpower and resources specially 
for your stratagem." 
  "You're a `giant of absurdity' yourself, and your ridicule 
isn't worth a damn." 
  Let us interrupt this protracted dialogue of the young 
pilots, the skeptic and the optimist, which almost reached the 
point of blows. Behind it is not so much youthful fervor as the 
reflection of a serious problem. One can understand the skeptic, 
who marshals quite convincing arguments to deny stratagem. To 
some measure he unfortunately is correct, it is harder to 
achieve it now. But did the optimists use all the arguments in 
order to prove the reality of this "weapon" in the modern 
battle? One need not wax sarcastic here. 
  So what are the capabilities and the field of application of 
military stratagem in tactics? Can one, and if one can, then 
how, confuse the adversary, how can one conceal one's true 
intentions in those unfavorable conditions of which they spoke 
in the dialogue? In order to respond to these questions and to 
learn the secrets of military stratagem, there is nothing more 
convincing or graphic than specific examples. 
  On one tactical air exercise, squadron commander Major S. 
Grishalev received the mission of clearing the air space and 
tying down the "enemy" fighters on duty in the zone. The 
assessment of battle variants began. There were several, but the 
commander rejected one after another. What was it that hampered 
him from finding a suitable variant? He knew that the tactical 
performance characteristics of the planes and the level of 
training of the pilots of the opposing sides were about the 
same. The difference lay elsewhere. The squadron had to perform 
the mission over "enemy" territory, his ground radars monitored 
the situation, while the friendly fighters were unable to obtain 
target designation from the CP. 
  After weighing his own and the "enemy's" capabilities, the 
commander concluded that the squadron's chances of beating or 
even simply tying down the fighters in the zone for a long time 
were minimal, and the losses might turn out to be quite heavy. 
Here it was simply necessary to develop an unusual, daring, even 
risky variant which would make it possible to confuse the 
adversary and achieve success. 
  In order to confuse the adversary, there are two evident 
variants: use of very low altitudes, and the jamming of enemy 
radars. But for fighters these variants are not very suitable -- 
they do not select the flight altitude, which depends on the 
alert altitude of the fighters of the "adversary," and they do 
not have powerful EW apparatus. Here one can count only on other 
tactical techniques. 
  After thinking it over to the extent that time permitted, 
the 
commander adopted a non-standard decision: to break up the 
battle formation of the squadron, and separate a flight from it 
which was to proceed at a much higher altitude than the main 
group. Of course the squadron commander foresaw the puzzled 
glances of his subordinates (instead of massing efforts of the 
fighters for the decisive first attack, he, the commander for 
some reason was dispersing them), but the results of 
calculations, which the commander was convinced were correct, 
favored the decision. 
  That is what happened. When the squadron reached the battle 
region, the "adversary" did not notice the main group, since he 
was occupied by the flight, which was earlier detected by his 
radar, and about which he received target designation from his 
CP. In performing the functions of a decoy element, the flight 
did everything to be noticed. From the energetic offensive 
maneuver which the "adversary" carried out, it became clear that 
the commander's plan was realized and the battle unfolded in 
accordance with it. 
  Acting deliberately, without camouflage and concealment, the 
"decoys" were able to draw the "adversary" under the strike of 
the main group and assured its covertness of closure and attack. 
The effect exceeded all expectations. Tied down by these 
actions, the commander of the attacked group did not have time 
to get his bearings in time, and issue commands to the wingmen. 
The battle formation and the tactical coordination in the group 
was disrupted, and it was impossible to restore it in the course 
of the battle. 
  The technique was risky (if the "adversary" had figured out 
the plan of the fighters, they would have been destroyed in 
detail) but it was effective under the conditions when it seemed 
that even to think of covertness of action would have been naive. 
  After the exercise, the pilots of the opposing side blamed 
everything on the CP crew, which had not noticed the assault 
element, but they also did not hide the fact that they are not 
confronted by stratagem all that often in their routine 
training. They said they expected standard actions, and then, 
all at once, there was another element. And the fighters did not 
operate "by the rules," which also caused confusion. Well, it is 
true that there is fertile ground for such arguments. Perhaps, 
precisely because the skeptical pilot, with a persistence worthy 
of a better application, convinced his comrade that stratagem 
had died away? 
  Another example. An assault group of bombers, escorted by 
fighters, had the mission of delivering a strike on an objective 
which was of great importance. Successfully repelling the 
attacks of the fighters of the defending side, it fought its way 
stubbornly to the target. Then the commander directing the 
actions of the fighters from the CP scrambled three separate 
elements to intercept it. Two of them were weak in numbers, and, 
not concealing their intentions, they created a threat of enemy 
attack simultaneously from two directions, and drew the fighter 
protection toward them. But the third, the main force, attacked 
the bombers unhindered, and, using the confusion of the 
"adversary," they delivered a devastating strike. Stratagem 
again saved the pilots. 
  It remains for us to look at the place of stratagem in the 
very critical situation of battle, when, it would appear, there 
is nothing that can be done except witness one's defeat. 
  A fighter flight, according to the received mission, was 
penetrating "enemy" territory. As in the first example, the 
pilots realized that they were under direct surveillance of his 
radar, and that they could not count on the help of their CP. 
They were still conducting a search, the screens of the onboard 
radar sights were still clear, and there were no returns on 
them, when suddenly they heard in the earphones: 
  "I see a target. I am attacking!" 
  These familiar words were uttered not by the flight 
commander 
Captain I. Shaklin or by his subordinates. When the captain 
heard them, he looked in his periscope and saw enemy fighters in 
the aft hemisphere. Their tactical advantage appeared 
indisputable, the defeat inevitable. In order to somehow evade 
the strike, the flight began a turn at maximum G force, but the 
fighters raced after them. Their leader resolutely constructed 
the maneuver, and probably was already counting down the last 
seconds before commencing fire. 
  Here it is, a moment when only something unexpected can foil 
the attack. But what was to be done? In this critical situation, 
in order to change the position of the sides, Shaklin decided to 
try a stratagem. A brief command and all the pilots reduced 
their G forces for several seconds. The adversary could have 
engaged them without hindrance if he had foreseen the 
possibility of such an illogical action. But he was already 
convinced that the attacked planes would seek to escape from 
their pursuers only through maximum G forces, and therefore, 
without guessing Shaklin's plan, he put his foot in it, so to 
speak. In contrast to the "adversary," the flight commander 
controlled the situation and recalled that he had mere seconds 
to seize the initiative. When the planes had gained the 
necessary velocity reserve, he put the element into an energetic 
turn. The picture of the battle changed sharply. Maneuver, 
another maneuver... Now the rivals were on equal terms. The 
stratagem succeeded, and the outcome of the battle was now a 
matter of technique. 
  Let us now move on from individual episodes to broader 
generalities. Despite all the variety of tactical situations, 
let us try to formulate a general concept of "stratagem." It may 
be understood as those actions of pilots and CP crews which 
distract the attention of the adversary, create an incorrect 
idea of the situation in him, and thus deprive him of the 
opportunity to realize his plan and leads to the adoption of 
erroneous or late decisions. Stratagem should be considered 
successful if the adversary cannot guess it and take 
countermeasures before the fighters attack him. The more unclear 
and difficult the situation for the adversary, the longer the 
action of military stratagem will last. 
  So what promoted the attainment of stratagem in the three 
described episodes? I believe that the determining conditions of 
success were in the tactical and piloting proficiency of the 
commander and all the pilots. Much depended on how creatively 
they were able to use unusual, surprise techniques, how they 
were able to force their will on the adversary in performance of 
tactical missions. But if we look into these three small 
episodes, we can see that they mirror the basic components of 
stratagem. Let us try to formulate them. 
  First of all, it is necessary to act the way that the 
adversary least expects, i.e., to create situations for which he 
is unprepared. To catch the adversary unprepared for retaliatory 
actions means to force him to abandon earlier decisions and to 
make new ones. Such decisions, adopted hurriedly, without 
adequate calculation and soundness, will correspond less to the 
changing situation and may lead the adversary to defeat. But 
this requires one to play some sort of "surprise" on him, to use 
a tactical technique which is capable of stunning the enemy, to 
create a false idea of one's intentions, to confront him with 
the need to react to our actions by the laws of logic known only 
to us. Persistence, initiative, and even daring in combination 
with able use of weapons and precise interaction within an 
element and between elements will make it possible to muddle the 
adversary's plan of battle and draw him into a trap. 
  Second, exceptional speed of action is required. A stratagem 
retains its force until the surprised adversary figures out, if 
he can, the plan of the fighters and begins to counter them. To 
hit the enemy before he realizes he is being attacked means to 
beat him to the punch in maneuver, to be the first one to 
accelerate one's plane, to gain altitude or descend in order to 
assure oneself the conditions for a surprise attack, to appear 
unexpectedly in a convenient fire position and immediately use 
one's weapons. 
  Third, a readiness to undertake risk is needed. A stratagem 
is always associated with it, and he who knows how to take a 
well-founded risk gains greater advantages in battle. When an 
exceptionally hard and solitary chance will lead to victory, one 
must resolve to take it. 
  Of course risk by its nature is not safe. While the need for 
it is obvious in a military battle with a real enemy, in 
training flights where the adversary is just hypothetical it is 
very difficult to determine its acceptable limits. This is a 
subtle matter. There is not, there cannot be, an instrument 
which could objectively measure such limits, where stratagem 
does not contradict the rules of flight safety. 
  It would seem that not so many intricacies must be allowed 
for in order to learn stratagem. But stratagem is not impromptu, 
although at times you can't get by without it. When I asked 
Shaklin how he managed to react so quickly to a critical 
situation, and so nimbly evade the strike, he got a large album 
and mutely handed it to me. Paging through it, I saw carefully 
devised variants of fighter battles, corroborated by the results 
of modelling. Also in the album (albeit in general features) was 
the variant by which the flight operated. 
  "Well fine," one reader might say. "So it is just a matter 
of 
thoroughly studying all components of stratagem ahead of time, 
to stock up on its variants, and its attainment will be assured?" 
  "No," I respond. "It will not be assured, even if all 
components are allowed for." 
  Judge for yourselves. A squadron was given the mission of 
destroying an early-warning aircraft in the depth of the 
adversary's territory. The pilots had already accomplished such 
a mission in past tactical exercise. At that time, thanks to an 
original combination of decoy actions with an encirclement 
maneuver, they managed to disorient the adversary's fighter 
protection and draw the early-warning plane into a trap. The 
stratagem of the pilots, their surprise attack on the target, 
were especially noted by a senior officer at the exercise 
critique. But now, when the squadron again used its experience, 
it fell into a trap itself. The "adversary" was on the alert. 
  This is why the above components may be considered only 
general rules of stratagem. It must also be original. Ask any 
pilot having in his reserve a very great number of tactical 
techniques, does he have occasion to use the identical "traps" 
in ready-made form. I am certain that you will receive a 
negative answer. Do you think such a thing would be appropriate 
in tactics, which by its nature does not brook cliche? Clearly 
any tactical technique may quickly exhaust itself if it is used 
repeatedly in accordance with an established scheme, which 
sooner or later will be uncovered by the adversary. 
  Thus stratagem is a multifaceted concept, a less painful 
path 
to victory. Today it is used differently than in the past, when 
the opposing sides did not have widespread radar detection 
systems, but even today there are not and cannot be stereotypes, 
for this would contradict the very essence of stratagem. One 
must know how to vary different combinations of tactical 
techniques in accordance with all the diversity of conditions. 
<H5>  3. Do You Know How To Make Seconds Count? </H5>
  A tactical flight exercise was under way. Many tens of 
kilometers from the CP an event was under way in the sky which 
called commitment of fighters to battle. The planes took off 
pair after pair. The commander, following the scrambling of the 
fighters with his watch, smiled: the pilots had exceeded the 
standards. He did not imagine at that moment how soon he himself 
and, even more so, his subordinates would require this quality, 
the ability to make seconds count. 
  Some time later, when the commander glanced at the plotting 
board, he immediately grew alarmed: one of the air targets 
moving to one side, to which he had initially not paid 
attention, had suddenly changed course and begun to approach an 
important installation. From the rapid shifting of the target 
return on the board, it was not hard to determine that it was 
going at high speed. There was not a second to spare. 
  The commander was well aware that in the developing 
situation 
everything depended on speed of action. But how was he to gain 
time, how could he beat the adversary to the objective? There 
was no time left to scramble fighters from the airfield. In his 
search for an acceptable solution, he again looked at the board. 
A pair of fighters proceeding to intercept another pair, which 
was still at a significant distance from the designated 
perimeter, was the closest to the dangerous target. Assessing 
the possibilities of intercept of this target by the other 
fighters, and convinced of its feasibility, the commander 
decided to retarget the pair at the new target. This decision 
made itself, as it were, but behind it lay the hard thinking of 
the commander, speed of calculation, recalculation of 
perimeters, flight modes of the fighters, and precise control of 
the fighters in the air. 
  The pair leader, receiving the new mission from the CP, 
realized that lost seconds in the flight to the target would be 
practically irretrievable. Thus the fighters had to reach the 
attack line in an extremely short time, but this was not all. It 
was possible to quickly detect the target, but not draw any 
tactical advantage from this, if the position assumed in the 
search and the battle formation of the pair did not allow 
immediate closure. And in the lost seconds the adversary would 
deliver a strike. 
  The leader decided to go for the target at maximum 
permissible speed and with an increased interval between the 
planes in the pair to attack the adversary even if the wingman 
lagged behind. In this case the calculation was sound: it 
allowed the possibility of accomplishing the attack by one of 
the fighters in the shortest time, and also of building up 
forces if the adversary were to maneuver. 
  Now the target was detected and identified, but its 
objective 
was also nearly at hand. The adversary, upon detecting the 
fighters, began to maneuver energetically and put the pair 
leader in a difficult situation. There followed an energetic 
counter-maneuver of the wingman who was lagging somewhat behind, 
precise aiming, and the target was destroyed when they were just 
a few seconds from the objective. The attack was fast-moving, 
and as the data of the flight recording equipment confirmed, it 
was precise. 
  This is what it means to make seconds count. There is a good 
reason why pilots joke that time is like air. When its there, no 
one notices it, and when its not there, everybody suffocates. 
  There is no question, in situations characterized by an 
urgent time shortage, it is not always easy to perform. There 
are times when the very best decision may prove useless, when it 
is made late, and the most clever tactical techniques will not 
bring success if they are made too late. But it goes without 
saying that a time limitation cannot serve as justification for 
tardy actions and miscalculations in battle. If a commander is 
tardy in assessing the situation, is slow in issuing the battle 
order, if the pilots are late in scrambling or display a lack of 
resolve upon detecting the target, the result is the same: a 
well thought-out battle may end in failure. 
  The time element has always played a role in tactics, and 
fighters also were confronted with time shortages back in the 
Great Patriotic War. The success went to those who valued and 
knew how to use time. 
  At Kursk, this was 12 July 1943, a squadron of Yak-9s was 
protecting our troops. Eighteen fascist Heinkel-111 bombers 
appeared very high above the fighters, and even higher a group 
of Messerschmidts covering them. Neither the correlation of 
forces nor the relative disposition of friendly and enemy planes 
favored joining battle. What was to be done? The squadron 
commander decided to attack the bombers, not straight on, but 
first to gain altitude, get a little closer, assume a tactically 
favorable position for battle, and hit the adversary when he was 
more certain of success. Well, of course, this decision was well 
founded. But the commander lost sight of one important 
circumstance: the bombers were already approaching our forward 
edge, and he could not know what terrible danger their bombs 
posed to our troops. To gain altitude and execute a protracted 
maneuver meant to lose time, during which the irretrievable 
could occur: the enemy would have time to deliver a strike 
before the fighters attacked him. 
  Major F. Gnezdilov took another way. That same day he found 
himself in a similar, but more complex, situation. He was 
leading eight Yaks which encountered 36 Heinkels, also protected 
by fighters. Of course, all of the pilots expected to meet the 
adversary, but none expected such a large group. However the 
commander well knew the value of time: the most important thing 
was not to allow the fighters to drop their bombs on the 
protected troops. He headed one flight right at the enemy 
fighters, and the other at his command went into a steep dive, 
and using their great velocity reserve, broke swiftly into the 
battle formation of the bombers. Crimson tongs of flame and 
tails of brown smoke immediately extended behind three planes. 
While the enemy in confusion tried to figure out what was 
happening, the Yaks leapt through the Heinkel formation and 
again attacked them, now head to head. Again two enemy planes 
began to smoke. And then the battle formation of the enormous 
armada fell apart. The fascists dropped their load hastily, 
wherever it might land, and hastened to retreat. 
  I am taking a long time to speak of these precious seconds, 
but there, in the air battles, they were much shorter. The error 
of the commander who does not know the value of time is 
unforgivable, and all praise goes to the bold but calculating 
decisions which do not allow delays which the adversary might 
use. 
  But let us return to today. Imagine for a minute that you 
are 
in the cockpit of a MiG-26 fighter, and are leading a group to 
air-to-air combat, and hunched over your sight you await the 
appearance of a target. Now say, how much time will you have to 
make a battle decision, once you detect a target, in comparison 
with the past? 
  In seeking an answer to this question, you will think of the 
high speeds and rate of climb of your fighters, and of course 
will not forget the suspended all-aspect missiles which do not 
require long closure with the adversary and which can destroy 
him at long distance. 
  The easiest answer: the time to make a decision has 
decreased 
immeasurably. Who can deny it? But can one measure this 
"immeasurable time"? 
  But then, judge yourself, let us count the seconds, which 
sometimes are more eloquent than words. Let us estimate the 
approximate distribution of time for all actions of pilots of 
average proficiency after detection of the adversary (fig. 39). 
It is clear from the figure that the total time which the 
fighters have before missile launch is around 50-60 seconds. But 
what time remains to the element commander to make a decision 
(tp, ts, and tr)? I believe that the meaning of this requires no 
comment. This time can scarcely be increased, as it is 
impossible to restrict the speed of the attack. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-76A>      Figure 39. Time characteristics of attack on a headon course. </FIG>

  Probably this interpretation will not suit many. That may be 
the case, the experienced reader will argue, but why look at the 
work of the commander only in the most difficult conditions, 
when closing with an adversary head-to-head? Let us take such 
doubts seriously, and now analyze the time characteristics of 
command functions under other conditions. 
  At first glance everything is much easier. Let us assume 
that 
a flight commander, vectored by the control center to the rear 
hemisphere of the target, sees a group of eight aircraft ahead 
of him. Upon detecting our fighters, it executes an unexpected 
maneuver (fig. 40, I). Assuming that the tactical performance 
characteristics of the planes of the opposing sides are equal in 
the majority of components, let us analyze the distribution of 
time expenditures in this case. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-77A>      Figure 40. Capabilities of executing the decision of a flight commander in terms of time pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a </FIG>


  Here the tactics are obvious. In the prevailing situation, 
the flight must either attack one of the separating groups with 
the entire complement, or, more favorably, both groups with 
pairs, despite the numerical advantage of the adversary (fig. 
40, II). Then both groups would be tied down in battle, and the 
initiative would be with our fighters. 
  Let us return to dry but objective figures. After making the 
battle decision in the same time as in the preceding example, 
the flight commander, in order to transmit his command to the 
other pair, must push the button of the transmitter and say a 
minimum of five or six words ("Attack left element, right target 
is yours.") -- four or five seconds. How much time is then 
required of the leader of the second pair in order to understand 
the command and begin the maneuver? By the most modest 
calculations, 10-12 seconds will be expended. In this time the 
adversary will turn to meet the fighters or go beyond the limits 
of visibility. 
  We are limiting ourselves to a small fragment of the battle 
in order to demonstrate all the complexity of fighting for every 
second. How many such consecutive fragments confront the 
commander with the threat of a negative balance of time! This 
very important conclusion, at first glance even paradoxical, is 
completely legitimate. The significance, effectiveness and 
practical feasibility of tactical techniques are more and more 
determined by the time factor, and this must not be 
underestimated. One must deal with reality, and it is truly 
worth thinking about and, after thinking, seeking the paths of 
further tactical development. 
  However, the ability to make seconds count in an air battle 
is only one of the aspects of the time factor. Another no less 
important is the struggle for seconds in the organization of the 
fighter sortie and their commitment to battle. 
  Here radar subunits have detected the adversary in the air. 
The first routes of the air targets have appeared on the 
plotting boards of the CP, and the competition to win time has 
begun between the opposing sides. Who then will win? This 
estimate can be made if one compares the flight time of the 
adversary (Tf), the time he takes to fly to the point of 
engagement of the fighters (RVB) with the time spent on 
commitment (Tvv). It goes without saying that the time spent on 
the commitment to battle must be less or at last equal to the 
flight time of the adversary. This condition (fig. 41) may be 
formulated in the form of the following expression: 
  Tvv less than Tf 
  The flight time of the adversary has a special meaning. 
Essentially it is the time resource which the adversary "gives" 
to the fighters to repel the raid. In order to calculate the 
flight time, one must know the range of detection of the 
adversary by ground radars, or by airborne early warning 
complexes at various altitudes, and their location relative to 
the point of engagement d. The obtained distance between 
the perimeters of detection and commitment of the fighters, 
divided by the speed of the adversary, gives his flight time 
(fig. 41). 

<FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-008L-78A>      Figure 41. Conditions for timely commitment of fighters to battle, </FIG>


  Another reader might think that the flight time does not 
depend on our actions. The adversary himself will chose the 
appropriate altitudes and flight speeds for himself, and the 
location of the radars is determined by the senior officer. This 
is not so. The flight time may be increased, especially under 
conditions of a difficult jamming situation, by using the 
information of all types of reconnaissance capable of detecting 
the scrambling of enemy aviation from their airfields and 
tracking their flight until entry into the radar zones, and also 
by speeding up the receipt and display of data regarding the air 
situation. 
  Let us track the route of information about the adversary 
from his detection until the commander's reaction to it. The 
main suppliers of information about the air situation remain for 
the present the radar subunits, which transmit it to the higher 
CP, where data are synthesized and systematized, and then go to 
the CPs of the aviation units. It would seem that everything is 
smooth and simple, by how much time do these manipulations 
require? In this time the adversary will have time to cover many 
tens of kilometers. Information from the higher CP lags 
constantly. If the commander wants to increase the flight time 
of the adversary, he must try to obtain fresher data from the 
radar subunit with which he is directly coordinating, and to 
involve the fighters themselves, performing missions over enemy 
territory, in reconnaissance of air targets. 
  Now let us turn to the second component of the above 
inequality -- the time required for commitment of fighters to 
battle (Tvv). As is clear from figure 41, this time consists of 
the time spent by the commander to adopt a decision (tr), 
transmit the command to the fighters for sortie (tk), their 
preparation (tp), takeoff (tt) and assembly in battle formation 
(ts), fight to the attack line (tb) and for maneuver for the 
start of battle (tm). The sum of the indicated times is the 
total time (Tvv). Of course a negative difference between them 
and the flight time of the adversary, as in the air-to-air 
battle, is unacceptable. There are many ways of shortening the 
time of commitment of the fighters to battle. All categories of 
personnel participate in seeking and implementing these ways. 
  Let us begin with the commander. He must make the battle 
decision. Whether this decision is formulated in written form 
with all specifics, or is concentrated in just a few phrases, it 
is always made in accordance with a specific algorithm. Let us 
again examine that familiar chain of actions which the 
commander's thought runs through: clarification of the mission, 
estimation of the situation, the decision, formulation of the 
decision, assignment of tasks to subordinates... The commander 
is completely familiar with the working procedures of this 
logical algorithm. So why would he go slow in searching for a 
rational decision, even when he knows the negative consequences 
of tardiness? Let us try to enter into his position. A great 
volume of data, and non-specificity of the situation, 
multiplicity of alternative situations and variants of battle, 
and along with this an urgent time shortage, which does not fit 
into the customary framework of the recent past, these are the 
reasons. Much has been written about this, so there is no need 
to repeat it. In battle there should not be any long-winded 
instructions, verbose reports, or a profusion of eloquent 
documents. 
  And if the time shortage is so urgent that there is no time 
at all for clarification of the mission, estimate of the 
situation, and other components of the process of developing the 
decision, what then? That also happens. Events in the air 
develop more and more quickly and unexpectedly. Therefore it is 
often necessary to run a risk, relying only on one's personal 
experience and foresight. The commander must react 
instantaneously to suddenly arising threats. It seems to me that 
under such conditions one must change the program of 
decision-making and that a more flexible algorithm, developed on 
the principle of "If I do not know what to do, then I will do 
this..." would not be out of place. 
  Sure, a "daring" decision made by such an algorithm will be 
risky, and not entirely correct under the conditions of the 
specific situation, but that is better than a late decision 
which cannot be implemented at all, or simple passive waiting 
for the outcome. An algorithm for such situations may be the 
most simple, and then subsequently with clarification of the 
situation can always be modified. 
  In corroboration of this, I will site one instructive 
example. The adversary managed to organize a raid on an airfield 
where fighters were based in such a way that the commander 
learned too late of their approach. The advantages of the 
attacker are well known. He has the initiative in the choice of 
method and time of delivery of the strike, in order to put the 
defenders in an unfavorable position. What was to be done. 
Perhaps, proceeding from the strict logic of the "classical" 
algorithm, to make a sound decision to repel the raid? But the 
threat of the strike was too evident, and the commander 
immediately issued the command to scramble the alert subunit to 
protect the airfield. What did he hope for in making this 
unconsidered decision? Of course, the takeoff of such small 
forces did not allow him to prevent the strike, but the 
commander assumed that just their presence in the region of the 
airfield would lower the effectiveness of the strike and give 
additional time to clarify the decision. And that is what 
happened. The duty subunit immediately after takeoff attacked 
the first element of enemy planes already appearing over the 
airfield, which did not have the strength to hinder the 
beginning scramble of the main forces. Under its protection the 
fighters took off pair by pair and immediately joined battle. 
And the strike on the airfield did not take place after all. 
  Strictly speaking, it would be incorrect to call the 
commander's decision unconsidered. An estimate of the situation, 
albeit very brief, had preceded it. Of course the officer 
reckoned that the time was clearly inadequate to scramble all 
forces to evade the strike, and he allowed for the fact that it 
was also not advisable to wait out the strike on the airfield, 
because the fighters at this time were not in their shelters. 
However his decision was based solely on personal experience. He 
understood also that the takeoff of the duty subunit to meet the 
adversary was associated with a well-known risk, taking off 
under fire. 
  Thus what conclusion can be drawn from this episode? That 
this was the victory of experience and foresight over the 
traditional algorithm. Perhaps the considered algorithm is not 
indisputable. After all they say with good reasons that truth is 
born in controversy and experience. Arguments and discussions 
occur in order that different opinions be expressed, and so that 
the reader may draw his own conclusions and look for the truth. 
  Now let us turn the conversion from the intellectual sphere, 
so to speak, to the material sphere -- preparation for combat 
flight of the aircraft and armament. The significant time 
expenditures in this sphere, which restrain the timely 
commitment of the fighters to battle, are no secret to anyone. 
Complicated aviation complexes, which require strict and 
punctual accomplishment of many operations of maintenance and 
work in accordance with rigid schedules, have still not fully 
stimulated a reduction in the turn-around times of fighters. 
Much time is needed to find the causes of failures, and correct 
various defects. And this is done under conditions when the 
slightest omission in preparation of the planes and the 
equipment mounted on them, which are based on electronics, may 
be catastrophic in battle. 
  One is somewhat reassured, and some hopes are raised, by the 
technical ways of satisfying the requirements of tactics for 
minimal volume and minimal time of technical maintenance (they 
were mentioned in chapter II), but again, seconds are growing 
"shorter and shorter." And this means that such well known 
requirements as constant maintenance of the aviation equipment 
in excellent condition, a high level of proficiency and personal 
responsibility of each specialist maintaining the equipment and 
arms, team-work in the actions of all the engineer and technical 
staff, and high technical culture remain in force, and continue 
to retain their importance. 
  The fight for time also makes a vital impression on the 
actions of flight personnel. I will not tire the reader with a 
recitation of the whole group of well-known measures which speed 
up the processes of fighter sorties, beginning with engine start 
and taxiing to the takeoff points. However situations which 
arise here at times give grounds for gloomy thoughts. Once 
during a training alert I watched a plane taxi out onto the 
runway, guided by a young pilot. This time he performed in 
terrible haste, forgetting safety measures. He exceeded the taxi 
speed and made some sharp turns, causing a breakdown on the 
plane. He had to return to the parking area. Does one have to 
prove that hastiness of pilots in reports, their distortion in 
comparison with the established form, may lead to repeated 
questions from the CP, and even to incorrect commands if these 
reports are misunderstood? Many "excess" seconds are spent in 
correcting errors. 
  Haste and bustle, in which the probability of errors and 
blunders grows, are poor assistants to the pilots. This would 
seem to be an evident truth, but can one believe that everything 
is clear here? Look at another commander, who in training 
sessions is interested first of all in reducing the times of 
working operations of pilots with cockpit equipment, and you 
will see that speed of action proliferates into haste, into 
numerous errors. How to more quickly prepare for a sortie, to 
take off with minimal acceptable intervals between pairs, to 
reach the point of engagement at maximum possible speed, all 
these are untapped reserves of time, so necessary in battle, and 
open for discovery. The old tested method of "trial and error" 
is inappropriate here -- there is too little time for "trials," 
and the "errors" might prove too costly. How important, in the 
struggle for time, is the ability of the commander himself to 
make precious seconds count, to make rapid and correct decisions 
in difficult, critical situations! But speed of actions is good 
when it is precisely measured. 
  Thus the struggle of time indisputably rules out all haste, 
not speed and alacrity. These are precisely the necessary 
qualities, while haste is the absence of patience and 
self-control, which is a kind of laziness of thought, prompting 
one to quit the heavy work of assessing the situation when the 
possibility of decision-making is just taking shape, to speed up 
one action or another without need. Remember the familiar saying 
"make haste slowly" and consider whether we sometimes try to 
save seconds too easily or too arbitrarily. 
  Look at how you, the reader, would make decisions at the CP 
or in a training battle. Seconds lost in the estimate of the 
situation, in hearing the reports of specialists, the long 
seconds of pondering under the conditions of high-speed 
attacks... Think of the ultimate result of all this, and what 
advantages could be acquired if one truly learns to make seconds 
count. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The aspects of the air-to-air battle are multifaceted, and 
not all of them have been reflected here even briefly. In any 
battle, in order to achieve victory and avoid defeat in 
unfavorable situations, pilots must know how to use every 
capability of their weapons, how to outsmart the enemy, and to 
use time economically. However victory in battle goes not only 
to the pilots who personally attack the enemy, but also to those 
who direct the battle. Of course their participation is less 
noticeable, their contribution to victory less visible, and at 
times they are mentioned just in passing, but the demands put on 
them are no less, and first of all on the commander of the CP 
crew. 
<H5>  Chapter VII. How to Conduct Tactical Command and Control </H5>
<H5>  1. Knowledge and Capabilities Required of the Commander </H5>
  What are the activities of the commander at the CP? In order 
to respond to that, perhaps naive, question we transport 
ourselves mentally to the command post at, what is for us, the 
most interesting moment in the warding off of an "enemy" raid. 
The room is in semi-darkness. The weak light of the signal 
boards and indicators illuminates the shelves and tables holding 
the equipment and the concentrated faces of the specialists of 
the CP detail. Our glance lingers on the large vertical plotting 
board where the air conditions are depicted. 
  The work of the CP team appears very humdrum when viewed by 
an outsider. The CP receives continuous information concerning 
the situation in the air from the forward radar posts and from 
other sources. Here this information is processed and analyzed 
and from here the fighters in the air receive guidance. Those 
monitoring the plotting boards and those operating the equipment 
tirelessly track the air targets and their fighters. Here radio 
operators are providing uninterrupted communications. Officers 
directing the combat, riveted to their instruments, guide the 
fighters onto the targets, give the necessary commands to bring 
the aircraft into a tactically advantageous position as combat 
is initiated, render assistance in maintaining battle order, 
support tactical cooperation and flight safety. Behind 
sound-proof glass the officers, who maintain constant 
communications with the cooperating units supporting the 
subunits, transmit and receive the necessary information. 
  Periodically the commander looks at the vertical plotting 
board and its indicator, listens to the specialists' reports; 
from time to time he talks on the telephone, gives brief 
instructions over the loud speaker and even briefer instructions 
over the radio: "9-49, attack target!". To an outsider it would 
seem that the commander is not working as hard as the others. 
However, that is not the case. The CP team has no superfluous 
jobs, and the commander's job is particularly important. 
  One is reminded of the days gone by on the front. There were 
all kinds of commanders back then. There were those who "fought" 
primarily at the command post and with signal flags in their 
hands on the airfield. They themselves did not fly combat 
missions, had no understanding of how their pilots fought, 
didn't know how to conduct themselves in an air battle, didn't 
know who was worth something and who could be trusted with what. 
Must one be reminded of the irrefutable advantage a commander 
obtains when he instructs and trains his own pilots, acting as a 
role model. "Example is stronger than rules," "knowledge 
teaches, example attracts," "a good example is better than 
advice" -- these are popular old sayings. The wisdom of such 
sayings is obvious. Nothing inspires one to great deeds, nothing 
persuades one like the example of a commander. Therefore, if a 
commander wants to have capable air fighters, he himself leads 
them into battle. 
  However, at the same time we must not forget that the 
commander is, above all, a tactician, a combat organizer, who 
spends the greater part of his time at the CP where he has a 
better perspective on the situation than the pilot in the air 
now that radar information has become more accurate and more 
timely than in the not-too-distant past. 
  Of course, the nature of management has also changed. Under 
the influence of new aircraft technology and armaments, the 
processes and functions of management have been accelerated, and 
while their form has not changed, they have acquired a new 
quality. They have become more complex. It is generally known 
that without a commander no decisions are made, the technology 
is useless, and the people don't work. But I can't help but 
mention something else. In his head the commander holds a vast 
array of instructions, numerical data, and other information 
necessary for combat management. However, no matter how great 
the resources of human memory may be, they are, nevertheless, 
limited. If these resources are used recklessly, then, for all 
the effort, not only will you not achieve the necessary effect, 
but the result will be negative. 
  I am reminded of one such incident. Lieutenant colonel N. 
arrived at one of the aviation units from the Air Force Academy 
after completing his studies. He worked hard mastering his 
duties as commander. Superiors and colleagues who had spoken 
with him remarked that the officer was exceedingly well-versed 
in many spheres of operational-tactical and military technical 
knowledge. But then during one of the exercises a critical 
situation developed and it required that command and control of 
the fighters be transferred quickly to another CP. In order to 
do this the lieutenant colonel should have sent the tactical 
command and control officer the necessary information. And then 
it became clear that this man, who had appeared so 
comprehensively trained, didn't remember the very thing that he 
should have known by heart: the actual data concerning the 
capabilities of the fighters and of their command and control 
means. Afterwards, the officer lamented: "It was some kind of a 
delusion, they say -- I knew everything, and then when I needed 
it, I forgot it." Of course, it wasn't a matter of delusion. The 
man simply lost his head in the flood of information which came 
pouring down on him, and he forgot the most important thing he 
needed to know in the actual situation. 
  What knowledge and capabilities then should the commander at 
the CP possess? This question must be answered in the most 
specific terms of the commander's activities. When making 
decisions, the commander usually listens to his aides and 
specialists, and, if time allows, he might consult his 
instructions, reference books, or various text books; often it 
is simply necessary to do more than that. The commander's head 
is not like the memory unit of a computer. Therefore, the 
ability to quickly work with a number of documents, to find the 
necessary information and answers to the questions put to him 
are as essential to the commander as the information which he 
should know by heart. 
  A more complicated matter giving rise to a mass of 
contradictory opinions is that concerning what volume of 
essential information the commander should possess. Should he 
know the enemy? "What a question!", exclaims the reader, "It is 
even clear to a civilian that without knowledge of the enemy you 
can't entertain the thought of conducting battle with him." Yes, 
any commander should know the enemy, but to what degree, within 
what limits? Obviously it is not as important for the commander 
to keep in mind the composition and disposition of the aviation 
in the theater of operations, but it is vitally important to 
remember and to thoroughly know the combat capabilities of the 
various groups of enemy aircraft and the enemy's tactical ruses, 
because otherwise it is not possible to make decisions and 
revise them in the course of battle. 
  But to what degree is it necessary to be familiar with the 
command and control means? The commander now has many 
complicated and precise combat control levers concentrated in 
his hands. At his disposal are powerful means of communication, 
ground radar stations, the range of which is greater than the 
fighters' onboard sighting devices, automated systems and other 
very new electronic innovations. Obviously, the high degree of 
effectiveness of all this equipment at the commander's disposal 
depends on the reality of whether he has a perfect command of 
them. 
  Sometimes they say, referring to one commander or another: 
He 
knows the control means "down to the nuts and bolts." This 
testimonial is, without a doubt, flattering. However, is such a 
degree of knowledge required today? It appears that along with 
the usual professional knowledge, gaining more and more 
importance today is that knowledge which embraces the general 
principles of the control systems, their functional 
interdependence and capabilities under the actual conditions of 
the situation. In other words, the commander should have an 
irreproachable knowledge of what tasks can be carried out by the 
command and control means, what they will deliver to the 
commander, what estimates, how fast, and with what degree of 
reliability they can be performed, what variations of their 
usage in what tactical situations, when there are partial 
damages, and how much time is required to correct them. At the 
same time, it doesn't seem so bad if the commander isn't capable 
of performing calculations for an interception like a navigator, 
but he needs to assimilate the navigator's general principles in 
order that he avoid giving orders back to his command and 
control officers which he knows cannot be fulfilled and in order 
that he intelligently conduct tactical command and control. 
  And still, tactical mastery, i.e., the ability to conduct 
tactical command and control, seems to be the finishing touch to 
a commander's professionalism. Possessing a high degree of 
personal training, he should concentrate his managerial work on 
implementing plans, creating the most favorable conditions 
possible for those subordinate to the commanders and for the 
pilots to fulfill their assigned combat missions. 
  In the past few years much has changed in the activities of 
the commander at the CP. The technical command and control means 
-- "the commander's tactical aids" reflect the situation more 
completely and swiftly, automatize necessary calculations, but 
more and more often without warning they burst into the CP 
making management of the conditions more complicated. At the 
most inappropriate moment radio communications with the fighters 
which have just taken off are interrupted by the enemy, the 
screens are filled with interference, it becomes more and more 
difficult to identify the target blips. Here the commander has 
to manage under conditions where there is not enough 
information. But this means that he should be able to imagine 
the development of the air conditions and the position of his 
own aircraft in relation to those of the enemy not only based on 
the representations of the plotting board and the indicators, 
but also based on the results of calculations, the pilots' 
messages, and information arriving from other sources. He must 
know the possible ranges of changes in speed employed by the 
fighters in executing maneuvers; he must take into consideration 
the functional condition of the pilots, their degree of combat 
fatigue, and, finally, he must be able to imbue them with 
confidence and decisiveness, and to guarantee flight safety. 
  You can make list after list of everything that a commander 
should know, be capable of, and take into consideration when 
conducting tactical command and control. For example, the 
position of the sun and of cumulus clouds when the fighters are 
committing to combat. These sources of powerful thermal 
radiation, if they are not taken into consideration, will 
undoubtedly have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the 
attack when the pilot launches heat-seeking missiles. But it 
would be irrational and illogical for the commander to strive to 
make all the decisions for his pilots, to substitute petty 
guardianship for their decisions by constantly meddling in their 
actions. Such a style of leadership, giving rise to a surplus of 
energy and self-importance, not only infringes on the 
subordinates' right to initiative, but spares them their 
responsibilities. 
  What, then, is the upshot of these discussions? The range of 
knowledge and skills required of a CP commander is unusually 
broad. In addition, as they say in the manual, he is the 
immediate organizer of combat and political training, he is 
responsible for combat readiness, discipline, and the 
moral-political state of the personnel. Much strength and energy 
is required of the commander to carry out his daily activities 
of training and instructing his subordinates and managing his 
administrative and support affairs. There are many other facets 
in the "chief - subordinate" sub-system which is an integral 
part of any military system. All of this must be supported, 
merged, and kept under control in the proper manner. But from 
this point it follows that for the time being the CP commander 
should be spared unessential information, as we mentioned 
earlier, and he should be given the opportunity to assimilate 
precisely that knowledge and those skills that he will really 
need. One should never forget that when determining the final 
aims of commander training. Heterogeneous knowledge and skills 
(administrative, navigational, engineering) should give way to 
tactical interpretation applicable to the actual command and 
control functions of a commander. 
  Finally, there is one more group of circumstances without 
which there would be no commander. More than anyone else, the 
commander, if you will, must possess confidence, self-control, 
and a sense of responsibility for his decisions and actions. 
Every thought invested with the commander's great power and 
formed into a laconic combat order is very crucial because it 
brings many people and combat equipment into action. And if the 
commander is indecisive, isn't he incapable of taking the entire 
responsibility for fulfilling the combat mission? 
  It doesn't make sense to divide the responsibility, bit by 
bit, among everyone. In the final analysis the result would be 
that nobody would actually carry the responsibility. One 
commander foreseeing an "enemy" raid makes the decision to put 
fighters into the air in advance and does so, while another 
commander waits to see how the neighboring command post will act 
and waits for instructions from higher up. As a result the first 
takes full advantage of the opportunity to intercept the "enemy" 
on distant borders, while the second commander has significantly 
less opportunity to achieve this even though the aircraft in 
both cases are exactly the same. 
  And so, what does the commander do at the CP? Guided by the 
pre-planned scenarios and the training of the members of the CP 
team, he manages battle. Together with his team the commander 
tries to figure out the "enemy's" intentions; he sends up 
fighters and brings them to the point of engagement. It is 
difficult for the pilots themselves, and not always possible for 
them to determine a tactically advantageous position for 
attacking targets, to independently execute a maneuver when 
drawing close to the enemy, to take countermeasures in the face 
of the "enemy's" reciprocal attacks, to continuously observe the 
actions of their comrades in battle. Therefore, using the local 
and weather conditions, the commander and his aids secretively 
bring the fighters to the "enemy," help them to forestall the 
enemy through their actions, and to confuse the enemy as to 
their intentions, prompt them as to what maneuver they should 
use to initiate combat, from what direction they should expect 
an enemy attack, how to escape a strike, and thereby create 
favorable conditions for setting up for an engagement. 
  But then the group leaders report to the command post: "I 
see 
the target, I'm attacking." The battle has begun. The commander 
knows that if the battle disintegrates into uncoordinated 
dogfights of the fighters with the "enemy," it will hardly be 
possible to achieve great results. Therefore, when executing 
command and control he strives to create an advantageous 
correlation of forces, to coordinate reciprocal actions between 
the groups of different tactical designations according to time 
and location, and to concentrate their efforts on the most 
dangerous targets. 
  How does the commander do this? Don't look for stereotypical 
answers. He can, for example, in order to destroy the primary 
targets, direct several groups from different directions, he can 
begin with an engagement of the "enemy's" combined fighter 
cover, or he can also carry out a variation by employing 
missiles of various ranges. There are a multitude of other 
solutions, but in each case from the outset the commander must 
be able to locate the most dangerous targets in the "enemy's" 
complex tactical order of battle -- the strike forces, 
remembering to observe the rules of safety in flight. 
  In group combat the situation can change and become 
complicated very rapidly. Here the mixing of your own and enemy 
aircraft, and the cropping up of new points of engagement and 
the formation of heavily jammed sectors, which cannot be seen 
from the CP. If you can imagine that all of this is going on 
simultaneously (the situation is not all that improbable), it is 
not difficult to understand how important it is for the 
commander to know how to use the complex of ground means and the 
reports of the pilots, to logically think in order to properly 
orient himself in the situation, and to make the best use of the 
insufficient information. 
  The pilots know how important it is to be confident that at 
the command post there is an experienced, decisive commander and 
at the control panels there are competent, resolute officers 
capable of sending out comprehensive information on the air 
situation and of coming to their aid at any minute. The word of 
a tactical control officer giving a routine command on behalf of 
the commander is law, an order to be acted upon. And what if, 
when broadcast, this word sounds indecisive or, worst of all, 
what if there is no word at a time when a command is sorely 
needed? 
  Take, for example, guidance onto air targets. At first 
glance 
this is a simple matter, but, indeed, even when simplified, it 
is like orienting a person in the dark. 
  Let us suppose that the command post team has directed the 
fighters into the rear hemisphere of the target at a greater 
distance than was required. Then they have ahead of them a 
lengthy pursuit of the enemy, who, if he has detected the 
pursuit in a timely manner, can set up jamming and break away 
from the fighters. And it could also happen that the command 
post team completely failed to bring the fighters into an 
advantageous position for attack. Does such a thing occur? 
Unfortunately, yes. Such a miscalculation occurred on one of the 
tactical air exercises (a tactical command officer dawdled 
inexcusably). Of course, this affected the setting up of the 
engagement in the most negative way. When the fighters detected 
the "enemy" anyway and, in spite of the disadvantageousness of 
their position, tried to go over to the offensive, their actions 
were uncoordinated; the group was not a unified whole and was 
withdrawn from the engagement. Other fighters had to intercept 
the target. 
  Even worse incidents occur, if the CP team does not observe 
the rules of flight safety, and allows the fighters to exceed 
the speed limits set for the given type of aircraft, or allows 
the aircraft to come dangerously close to each other or the 
targets, or if the tactical command officers do not remember the 
minimum permissible fuel reserves for the various distances of 
the aircraft from the airfield. In such cases, disaster is not 
far away. 
  Mistakes in matters of command and control are dangerous and 
cannot always be corrected. The experience of wars on our own 
soil testifies to the fact that a significant percentage of 
combat losses of fighter aircraft is related to their being 
inadequately managed in air engagements. It is only as a result 
of errors committed by control centers when guiding aircraft, 
that approximately one third of the aircraft were lost. (See: 
AVIATION and COSMONAUTICS. 1987. No. 6. P. 4.) 
  The person responsible for these errors is primarily the 
commander, not only the commander managing combat, but the 
commander supervising the work of the CP team as well. It is 
namely he who should make efforts to attain mutual understanding 
and coordination in the work of his subordinates. At the same 
time, of foremost importance today is the commander's ability to 
conduct command and control from a CP equipped with modern 
automated systems. These two important aspects of a commander's 
activities deserve individual examination. 
<H5>  2. The Commander and His Subordinates </H5>
  The haze of the scorching air has been hanging over the 
airfield since morning, washing away the already unclear line of 
the horizon. On the ramps by the takeoff strip everything is at 
a standstill in expectation of the departure of the aircraft; 
the command post team has been on combat alert duty for hours. 
Behind them is the intense preparation for the big exercises, 
ahead of them the most crucial moment -- a flight to repulse the 
"enemy's" first massive raid. 
  Waiting for a raid at any moment is a rather oppressive 
affair. The longer the waiting lasts, imperceptibly, somehow 
little by little, an invisible nervous tension grows within the 
CP team. The commander himself is also quite excited, although 
he understands very well: he of all people cannot yield to 
emotions; indeed, dozens of pairs of eyes are trained on him. 
Sense and experience unerringly prompt him: in order to 
successfully carry out the upcoming complex mission, it is 
important to have a calm, psychologically stable situation at 
the CP. He knows that when people work together and relate 
kindly with one another, they are capable of a lot. The reasons 
for this -- a common goal, example, mutual support, competition, 
and, finally, their psychoemotional attitude. All of this 
increases each person's capacity for work. Yes, a person's 
capacity for work depends on his attitude, and here we are 
speaking not only about capacity for work, but about the 
performance of the most important combat missions, and, at time 
of war, about the preservation of defended installations and the 
lives of pilots in combat. 
  However, all of this is much easier to understand than to 
provide. The senior commander, in answer to the commander's 
interrogation over the telephone, just tossed out an angry: 
"Don't interfere, wait!" Sitting around a table the chief of 
staff lashed into the chief of communications. And then tactical 
control officers turned away from the radar indicators and 
stared at the commander, who had just finished his telephone 
conversation. The semi-darkness of the command post prevented 
him from making out their staring faces. A feeling of annoyance 
intensified the monotonous humming of the fan, which wasn't 
cooling. It was stuffy, hot, and the commander couldn't restrain 
himself: 
  "Well, what are you staring at? You're not supposed to be 
looking at me, you're supposed to be looking at the air 
situation!" He struck at their very hearts and then he turned 
away as if he had been deeply offended by his subordinates. 
  And indeed the commander had everything: knowledge, 
experience, resolute qualities. But there was just one thing -- 
he did not have enough respect for other people, and yes, if you 
will, modesty. It is not difficult to imagine what took place in 
the consciousness of those people, what humiliation they 
experienced as a result of those unjust words. Sullen and silent 
they no longer expect anything good out of dealings with the 
commander. 
  Let us leave the stuffy command post building for a short 
time and concern ourselves with the further development of 
events. What has happened makes one wonder. It is customary to 
call the CP the brain of the regiment. This "brain" will 
function more reliably the better each of its cells functions. 
But this depends on the coordination of the actions of the team, 
how well the members "fit" together, and their interaction with 
the commander. 
  Of course, unnecessary conversation and inattentiveness are 
impermissible at the CP. What's that? Chance or echelon are not 
very significant in the chain of disorders? It is not terribly 
difficult for the experienced commander to examine this. But 
what worse place for the rude shout than when the splash of 
emotions rises above the logic of reasoning. And what is the 
result? Don't resentment and enmity toward the commander, who 
should not respond so rudely, obscure the sense of duty and the 
desire of the subordinates to fulfill as well as possible that 
part of the combat mission which was entrusted to them? 
  We return once again to the command post and glance at the 
vertical plotting board that we have mentioned so often that is 
now already thickly covered with the various colors of the 
flight routes. Red and blue lines extend toward each other, bend 
and intersect. Gradually the "enemy's" tactical intentions are 
taking shape. His aircraft are attempting to break through to 
defended installations from two directions, maneuvering at an 
altitude under the cover of jamming. The air situation is 
becoming more complicated with every passing minute. Whitish 
bands of jamming thickly dotting the screens of the radar 
indicators, rapidly spread, become brighter, show more contour, 
and the tiny blips from the multitude of targets can hardly be 
distinguished one from another against the background of 
blinking dull color. The fighters repulse a massive "enemy" 
raid. Both sides are exceedingly active. 
  At the command post there is the usual working rhythm of 
combat operations; one hears reports, commands, and messages 
delivered in muffled tones. The commander is at his work 
station. Now he is calmness and self-control personified; he 
expresses his feelings judiciously and with restraint, he 
strictly controls his behavior. The commander's intonation, 
gestures, facial expressions, and the expression of his eyes are 
transmitted immediately to his subordinates. They all understand 
each other from half a word, half a gesture; everyone is imbued 
with a common goal -- how best to carry out the assigned 
mission. It is as if the low noise of the equipment creates a 
special coziness; nobody notices the stuffiness. Pair after 
pair, echelon after echelon, in the thunder of the afterburners 
they take off from the airfield. The tactical control officers 
do not take their eyes off of the blips on the indicator screens 
and guide the fighters onto the appropriate targets according to 
the commander's decision. It is natural that the commander acts 
as the unified center, the nucleus of command and control. He is 
constantly in his subordinates' field of view; their attention 
is riveted on him, as to the conductor of an orchestra. 
  Yes, the CP team is a peculiar sort of orchestra, where the 
role of the conductor belongs to the commander. It is namely he 
who must make the decisions, encompassing the strength of 
collective thought. But if the orchestra plays something wrong 
it only lowers the quality of the music, whereas a false note in 
the work of even the most insignificant "musician" at the CP can 
cause the fulfillment of the combat mission to be frustrated no 
less than the negligence of the "conductor" himself. The 
individual monitoring the plotting board was careless in 
plotting the information, things are not going well for the 
communications operator, the command and control officer is late 
delivering his commands, there is dissonance in the commands, in 
the clarifications... Is it really possible to conduct command 
and control with aides like these? 
  Not a single of the most competent and talented commanders 
can get along without a well-trained and hardworking CP team, 
but even a model team consisting of highly qualified specialists 
cannot ensure combat success without a competent commander. Such 
is the dialectic relationship at the commander - command post 
team level. The commander cannot exist on his own without a team 
acting as a single mechanism to evaluate the diversity of the 
air situation, and all the matters with which the subordinates 
working at the various stations are occupied. Only playing "by 
the notes", i.e., the coordination of all the members of the 
team, will ensure success. 
  The commander is at his work station. His gaze is directed 
at 
the plotting board; question after question occurs to him: what 
strength level of fighters should he employ; at what point of 
engagement; in cooperation with whom, and in what sequence 
should the current large target be intercepted? In what 
direction should efforts be concentrated in order to achieve 
superiority of forces over the enemy? No matter how 
comprehensively the commander has been trained, here he cannot 
get along without his own form of feedback, whereby the 
communication is not passive but active, entailing not only 
reports concerning the fulfillment of orders and commands, but 
also the issuing of evaluations full of initiative useful for 
the commander's decision making, and of constructive suggestions 
for the combat employment of the fighters. 
  Such timely evaluations and recommendations are of great 
value. To a great extent they help to find a way out of critical 
situations. But how important it is for the commander to regard 
them with interest so that he himself does not falter in those 
tense minutes. 
  And what if the commander is nervous and this inner 
agitation 
robs him of his equilibrium in dealing with his subordinates? 
What if he once again gives free rein to his emotions, is 
peremptory or categoric in his opinions, is persistent even when 
he is wrong, ignores people, cuts short their reports? Then 
don't expect any good to come of it. On the job even the most 
capable specialists are not immune to flaws. Look, someone has 
been slow in coming up with important information, somewhere a 
command was improperly executed or understood, a piece of 
equipment was improperly used. But why? People are rather afraid 
to show personal initiative, to ask that unintelligible commands 
be repeated, knowing that they will be met with the same shout 
and the same fault-finding of a commander who doesn't know how 
to listen. 
  This is the picture you get. The air situation is constantly 
changing, the leader has to work under extreme pressure and at 
the same time his subordinates are silent and instead of helping 
the commander they are waiting for additional instructions. But 
if the one is thinking about everything, then the others have 
simply stopped thinking. This way it is easier and simpler not 
to have to wrack your own brain, and you can always conceal your 
own tactical incompetence and laziness. And so the commander 
literally has to extort the data essential to him and waste time 
on unnecessary interrogations. Thus, he himself deprives himself 
of the support of his subordinates. 
  Such a picture could be the result of the team's being 
inadequately trained. Of course, well-founded evaluations and 
suggestions can actually only be given by officers who recognize 
their functional duties down to the last detail. People should 
be trained to work out the priority of reports, thereby ensuring 
that they will receive the best possible interpretation by the 
commander. Causes of a purely psychological nature should not be 
given a low priority. 
  Subordinates don't understand a commander as well when he 
shouts. The strength of his personality lies not in rudeness, 
but, more likely, on the contrary, in his tactfulness, 
sensitivity, and attentiveness to people. We always admire 
leaders who know how to conduct themselves, we see them in a 
good light. Self-control is a useful quality for everyone under 
any circumstances, but in tense situations it is simply a 
necessity. In order that subordinates not hide behind their 
commander's back, but work actively and strive to make a 
feasible contribution to the common problem, the commander does 
not have to strain his vocal chords, but quietly and calmly 
enlist the services of the entire CP team to conduct command and 
control. Then the task of command and control will become a 
common task and together it will be an easier task to fulfil. 
The science of not offending, if you will, is the easiest and at 
the same time the most complex concept for all of us. 
  How then can one manage to put together a team that is not 
just a haphazardly assembled group of people, but a solid 
collective, cemented by a sense of duty and responsibility? The 
secret here lies in the commander's ability to create a healthy 
moral and psychological atmosphere at the CP. It is important 
for each person, sensibly and with feeling, to realize his role 
and place in the mission being carried out by the CP team, as 
well as to be confident that when expressing the most audacious, 
even incorrect, ideas, he will not be rudely rebuffed by the 
commander. 
  And, nevertheless, to develop a steadfast belief in the 
commander -- that is half the battle. He himself should know and 
believe that each subordinate will fulfil his duties as he 
should. Without this it is not possible to have mutual 
understanding between the commander and his subordinates. 
  Here's another thing the commander must not forget. The 
command post team is made up of people with a variety of 
personalities and idiosyncracies, with their own "subtleties" 
and "vagaries." One may not like the way his work station 
neighbor converses, a second may not like the way this same 
colleague jokes, a third may not like the manners of the second. 
Forced as a result of their duty to constantly associate with 
one another, they all experience sympathy and antipathy which 
from time to time are difficult to explain. Here it isn't mutual 
understanding that occurs, but alienation and hostility among 
people -- something we refer to as psychological incompatibility. 
  The commander must help people to control their feelings, to 
exhibit mutual trust and benevolence. He has opportunities to do 
this because he sees his subordinates in the most varied 
situations and observes how they react, not only on a 
professional level, but also on a psychological one. For this 
reason it is easier for him to find motivating factors which 
will cause a person to act one way or another. Alas, this does 
not always pan out. 
  "Why didn't you give me a timely update on the changes in 
the 
air situation?", a commander reproaches one of his officers. 
  "You yourself ordered that we weren't to report unless we 
were asked," the officer's gaze reflects sincere bewilderment, 
and there are distinct traces of nervousness in the intonation 
of his voice as he answers. 
  The officer was reporting about everything he saw on the 
plotting board without any system and without selecting the most 
substantive information and in the course of his reports the 
main points got watered down. He could not yet grasp the meaning 
of his functional duties and simply bothered the commander. Then 
it made sense in his case to instruct him only to report when 
asked. But in this case he also received a reproof that he 
simply did not understand. But if you constantly reproach people 
for improper actions without taking into consideration the 
motivating factors, what will the result be? 
  Evidently, one should treat genuine experts in their field 
differently than one would treat random persons committing 
errors in their work. One should be patient in dealing with each 
person, show him how he could better contribute to the 
fulfillment of the common combat mission. You must adhere to the 
rule: if a glitch occurred somewhere, if someone was inaccurate 
-- don't rush in with remarks, and certainly not with reproofs, 
but point out the error in a calm tone, in a businesslike 
manner, to the person whose fault it was, and explain what the 
ramifications could be. 
  And now we once again turn to the commander who understands 
the secret of interaction with his subordinates. He is still 
managing the combat. The "enemy's" forces have not dried up, new 
targets continue to appear on the plotting boards and 
indicators, the thunder of the engines of airplanes taking off 
has not died down on the airfield. The commander sees that his 
men are tired and that fatigue is growing exponentially. Fatigue 
is an insidious thing. I recall that government commissions 
investigating the causes for railroad, shipping, aviational, and 
other catastrophes found that one of the main causes was fatigue 
of personnel brought about by systematic overworking. Prolonged 
physical and emotional stress give rise to apathy and 
indifference to the work being performed. The time put into the 
situation sometimes increases several fold, while the accuracy 
of the operations, on the other hand, sharply declines, and 
mistakes occur where they aren't at all expected. 
  Of course, not every case of fatigue gives rise to an 
explosion or a catastrophe, but one thing is clear: people 
require rest and recreation; otherwise, they might miss 
important commands or might not react to them in the proper way. 
But the commander cannot yet offer his subordinates the rest and 
recreation that they have earned. In other words, from time to 
time you've got to at least have a psychological release. 
  For a moment the activity on the plotting board and 
indicators has died down a bit, but the specialists cannot leave 
their work stations. How long will this lull last? Only the 
"enemy" can answer that question, but this is precisely the time 
to relieve some of the nervous tension built up after the long 
minutes, or even hours, of tiresome, monotonous work. 
  Who should do this? The commander, of course. It goes 
without 
saying that he himself has just experienced at least as much 
tension, he has shouldered as ponderable a burden; he would also 
like to take it easy, but first he has to take care of his 
subordinates. This is his duty as commander. But very little is 
required to do this: take a microphone in hand, call those who 
are particularly tired, and with a simple joke relieve the 
emotional tension. Of course, the wise commander will not start 
to scold and deride someone for a mistake, and will not allow 
himself to tell even one of those condescending jokes which 
might damage a person's dignity or pride. 
  Commander and subordinates... In our time public opinion has 
become exceptionally stirred up. People are aware of their right 
to participate in everything. Subordinates are watching their 
commander attentively; they see and evaluate everything. How 
complicated interaction can be sometimes in the tense rhythm of 
combat operations and how important it is to maintain the common 
equilibrium without pressure, not to allow someone's superiority 
in experience, in official position, or in their quick 
wittedness to turn into resentment, to wound someone's 
self-esteem. The people on the team are different, and, not 
without reason, a wise Armenian saying goes: "The way a 
commander is, that's how his subordinates are". 
<H5>  3. The Commander at the Computer </H5>
  The commander was uneasy. One minute he was sitting, the 
next 
pacing up and down, which for him was a sign of anxious 
brooding; now he sullenly glanced at his subordinates, but it 
was no use to upbraid them. The soft blinking light of the 
displays was reflected on the concentrated faces of the officers 
sitting at the display panels. They were processing data, 
performing various calculations, and using the information 
retrieval system. In the briefest period of time they found and 
delivered the necessary information to the commander. 
  However, returning to his work station the commander glanced 
at the column of figures, graphs, and text fragments flashing on 
the screen somewhat anxiously and then transferred his gaze to 
the electronic plotting board. The information set down by the 
computer printer not only gave an idea about the air conditions, 
but also showed the potential changes in the conditions based on 
the decisions made. The situation was shaping up unfavorably: 
fighters sent up to intercept a group air target are not in the 
best initial position for attack and the correlation of forces 
is also not advantageous. 
  Every commander is familiar with the feeling of vexation 
which arises after a serious error in decision-making. What 
essentially happened? Was the fighter force inadequate, were the 
pilots not well-trained enough, or was the command post team at 
fault? None of the above. There is another reason: the 
interception was performed according to a decision made by a 
computer, but the target went under the cover of jamming and 
actively maneuvered, its tracking was unsteady, the assessment 
questionable. And nevertheless, the commander decided to stick 
with the recommendations issued by the computer. 
  The officer turns once again to the computer. He wants to 
analyze the various decision scenarios, to juxtapose them, to 
evaluate the effectiveness of corrective measures. The input 
data and the conditions have changed... And again the computer 
has come to life, its multicolored lights are flashing; maybe 
this time it will be a different scenario. But, alas, under 
conditions where the information is incomplete or unauthentic, 
where there are alternative combat combinations which could not 
all be programmed, even the most modern computer can strike out. 
  "What was it like in the past, when there weren't any 
electronic gizmos to interfere with the commander's thinking and 
decision-making," sighed the commander and added with 
unconcealed irony, "We truly have woe from an electronic mind, 
and now you're supposed to do the thinking for a machine." 
  In that remark there is a hint of nostalgia for the old, 
"manual" methods of command and control -- a phenomenon which 
you might say is typical. Such is human psychology. It is not 
difficult to understand: isn't it better to act in accordance 
with the experience you have than to trust something unfamiliar? 
  But let's get on with the story. The commander, who at the 
outset shifted his functions to the computer, was able to 
correct the decisions he had made earlier. What remained was for 
him to put into effect the scenario which he had found to redeem 
the situation, which, as it turned out was not all that 
difficult. 
  ...The leader of the fighter group which was already being 
guided onto the target in the automated mode has not uttered a 
word since takeoff; the command post has also been silent. Just 
this sort of silent "conversation" was going on between the 
leader and the instruments in his cockpit, which were providing 
him with information for executing an interception. The group 
was already approaching the target, but the command and control 
officer, in keeping with the commander's revised decision, was 
able to recalculate and enter the new data into the computer. 
The triangular indexes moved smoothly along the indicator 
scales; a series of figures lit up on the message panels 
indicating the flight parameters. The automated system computed 
another trajectory for the fighters, and they then executed its 
"commands" with maximum accuracy. The most important thing was 
to maintain the assigned parameters, and that is not all that 
complex. Freeing the pilots from other secondary operations 
enabled them to better evaluate the situation and to get ready 
for the attack. Complete radio silence enabled them to achieve 
an element of surprise. 
  However, CP commanders and pilots who are a little older 
remember the times when guidance using an automatic control 
system was considered a novelty. They remember how skeptical 
they were when introduced to this system in flight. Silent 
flight without radio communications between the CP and the 
pilot, without constant prompting from the ground, was unusual. 
The pilots started to get nervous, they were late in reacting 
to the instrument commands. Switching their attention to those 
instruments, they forgot to monitor the other indicators. The 
movements of the control surfaces became more abrupt. 
  "It's all the fault of automation, it doesn't pull you out 
where you're supposed to be," sighed the commander, excusing the 
pilots after they had returned to the airfield from a failed 
photo-reconnaissance mission. "Guidance the old way, by voice, 
would have been more reliable." 
  Is it a matter of automation here? No, it works reliably. To 
make it the scapegoat is simply frivolous. Why, then, did so 
many treat automation with skepticism and mistrust? The old way 
was well known, tested repeatedly in practice, and seemed by 
force of habit to be more reliable than the new way, although 
the new way possessed many advantages. Therefore, along with the 
newest electronics, they set up areas with experimental radar 
indicators, nomograms, tables, and gave them a preference. 
Stormy arguments ensued as to whether the computer infringes on 
the commander's creative thinking. 
  A considerable amount of time has passed since then and 
perhaps there is no recollection of those noisy arguments, but 
today, as well, even experienced commanders sigh. They are 
troubled by the complexity of the new systems that need to be 
thoroughly mastered, but what troubles them even more is the 
necessity to do without the customary methods of command and 
control and to shift from direct interaction with subordinates 
to contact with them through automated means. Indeed, using the 
new system instructions and reports are passed in the form of 
specific signals and are interpreted without any emotional 
effect, and the very air situation is depicted, if one can use 
that term, in "coded form." The result is that the logic of the 
commander's decision is not known until the end, the need for 
emotional information is not satisfied and the commander's 
personality, to a certain degree, loses its sensual specificity. 
  Nevertheless, we are attempting, however briefly, to refrain 
from sighs of nostalgia, though we are speaking not only about 
today, but about days gone by as well. It's bad for any field if 
a specialist abandons new technology and arms himself with a 
crow-bar and a shovel. In the field of aviation this is even 
dangerous. We wouldn't want to exaggerate, but what can you do 
if the time parameters for any one of the commander's actions 
exceed his psychological capabilities for making decisions and 
for command and control, or if the amount of information coming 
to him becomes so great that he doesn't have time to comprehend 
it? 
  Can you imagine a volume of information consisting of 
multi-digit figures? Of course one can imagine it, but what is 
this volume of figures for? To understand what massive amounts 
of information concerning the enemy, his aircraft, and the 
conditions of the air situation circulate in contemporary 
command and control systems, what amount of time is required to 
process it and manually transmit it from the radar control 
panels at the CP, and for it to be assimilated by the commander. 
This creates a situation that is reminiscent of the famous story 
about the ill-fated meteorologist, who, when asked if he could, 
with complete accuracy, consider all the factors affecting 
tomorrow's weather, replied, "Yes, but to do that I'll need a 
week to perform the calculations." That is why the time is not 
too far off, when the basic mass of information will be fixed, 
stored, and represented in the machine's memory, when the 
commander simply cannot get along without automation. The way in 
which automation will serve the commander will depend on the 
commander's ability to use automation in his own interests. 
  In the complex interaction of the radio technical means 
delivering information, of the electronic "brain" reprocessing 
it, and of the operations of the commander himself, the 
situation is evaluated, a decision takes shape, the optimal 
flight paths and flight modes of the fighters to the points of 
engagement are calculated, and the commands to the pilots are 
worked out. The foundation of this interaction is the principle: 
transfer to the machine those tasks which it performs better 
than a human being, and leave to the human being those tasks 
with which only he can cope. The concept "better than a human 
being" includes, above all, the computer's incontestable 
superiority in those of its properties with which a human being 
cannot compete: speed, accuracy of calculation, formalized view 
of systems of logic. These properties make the computer a 
special amplifier of the commander's own creative abilities. 
  Automation can do a lot, but not everything. A still greater 
share is left to the commander. You see, the computer considers 
a limited number of factors. Strictly speaking, the system of 
algorithms and their function in the automatic control system 
are essentially a programmed operation for processing the 
commander's decision, only in the most general situations. As 
with any logical task, this operation cannot be formalized 
without specific assumptions; in the calculations and 
recommendations there are always some errors which are 
permissible for some situations, but require correction in 
others. 
  The commander thinks more slowly, but more complexly. 
However, it is precisely thanks to this complexity that he is 
capable of making decisions in non-typical, not previously 
experienced situations, under the most intricate circumstances, 
where (in any event, for the time being) the most "intelligent" 
computers would fall down. When there is insufficient 
information and the situation is unclear, as was the case, for 
example, in the episode described at the beginning of the 
section, a computer's decision would also be incomplete and 
under those conditions there would be no replacement for the 
commander. One could hardly expect the computer to exhibit 
initiative and resourcefulness; it won't be able to "think up" a 
war stratagem, and, you see, it is thanks to those capabilities 
that victory is achieved in combat. There is yet another quality 
that the commander possesses which cannot be attained by a 
computer and that is adequate in the evaluation of the 
situation, not giving way to a precise quantitative description. 
But, from another aspect, you can't get away from indecision, 
doubts (man -- not machine), and then the minutes granted to the 
commander by the computer he can use for deliberating and for 
more precise evaluations. 
  That is why in contemporary automatic control systems the 
commander is given the right to interfere with the operation of 
the computer and correct its recommendations. The commander is 
free to make decisions based on the computer's recommendations, 
he can take them partially into consideration or even reject 
them completely. He is guided by his own experience, the reports 
of the members of the CP team, and, of course, the situation's 
degree of uncertainty. As they say, you need to be able to 
listen to another person's mind, but you can't live through 
another person's mind. This means that you must not blindly 
follow the recommendations of the computer, but act according to 
the conditions as they take shape, making corrections for every 
specific situation; you must know that the computer is prompting 
only one of the admissible decisions. 
  Look what is emerging from our discussions. In the system 
"computer - commander" only the latter is active, and that is 
what determines his place in the system. Unfortunately, for some 
commanders the complexity of this system becomes a psychological 
barrier, and they begin to disregard at least some of its 
elements and capabilities. Sometimes the other extreme occurs -- 
the commander overestimates the computer's capabilities. The 
commander views the computer as a mechanism which can conduct 
command and control automatically. From this sort of commander 
you hear the expression now and then, "the computer produced the 
optimum variant." But the computer cannot think. Its intellect 
is simply a metaphorical name referring to programmed computers 
which imitate human activity. When the commander has unlimited 
faith in the infallibility of a computer, he transfers to it the 
decision-making role and becomes completely dependent on it. We 
recall once again the commander mentioned earlier who didn't 
know how to deal with the information provided him by the 
automatic control system. I would say that is a classic example 
of the illiterate use of that system. 
  Today at the end of a century of scientific-technological 
revolution and electronics, when the computer handles more and 
more of the command and control operations, questions are 
already occurring to the military reader: how will the 
relationship between the commander and the computer shape up in 
the future, and what new innovations await him? 
  These are not just idle questions. Let's try to have a look 
at the commander role of our successors. 
  The flood of information concerning the air situation is 
increasing, and, as it does, the time available to the commander 
is inexorably shortened -- a consequence of the growing dynamics 
of combat. The situation calls for perfected human-machine 
complexes based on expert systems which enable the automation of 
those command and control operations which cannot be based 
solely on ancient, eternally correct mathematics. The 
functioning of these complexes is based on longer-range methods, 
and, in particular, on the methods of artificial intelligence, 
which enable machines to solve informal-logical and heuristic 
problems without human interference, to represent these problems 
in the computer, and give them to the commander for 
decision-making. 
  Of course, we are speaking about systems in the 
more-distant-future. They will be able to relieve the commander 
of the burden of time devoted to uncreative problems and will 
provide an even more complete combination of the computer's 
capabilities with a human being's intellectual faculties. It 
will make possible a transition from the passive routine whereby 
the commander simply enters data into the computer and receives 
a ready result, to an active routine of interaction with the 
computer, as well as the automatic management of a data base and 
control over its expansion. 
  Using this system, in addition to the variant calculated by 
the computer, the commander will be able to enter his own 
intuitive variant into the computer, and it will be able to 
evaluate and select the best of them according to the accepted 
criterion (the extent of the damages being prevented to the 
defended installations, the number of targets hit, etc.). 
  And yet another innovation. With time, when the computer has 
the capability to perceive a human voice, although, perhaps not 
with all of its various levels of meaning, it will become 
possible for the commander to carry on a conversation with the 
computer, and, in the course of their dialogue, for the computer 
to give him alternative solutions based on the model "if..., 
then..." 
  This innovation requires clarification. You will have at 
your 
disposal a portable terminal unit which is connected to the 
computer. Using this unit you can simply read some sort of text 
and the computer will understand everything. Evaluating the 
situation or making a decision, you enter the initial 
information into this mechanism, and then a series of questions 
and responses in dialogue form ensues. The computer poses 
questions requesting more information, you respond to them, ask 
your own questions and receive responses. The displays and graph 
plotters "draw" and write without any mood swings, fixing the 
results of the calculations; the voice, devoid of human bias, 
recommends the very actions for the commander to expediently 
undertake. In so doing, it explains how and on the basis of what 
in the system the given problem was solved, and demonstrates the 
process of the "deductions" made by the computer. The first 
steps in developing units capable of spoken dialogue have 
already been taken. It is true, they are limited to a specific 
vocabulary that the computer is capable of perceiving and 
synthesizing. 
  The commander can expect innovations which are at least as 
interesting when he goes up into the air with his pilots. The 
onboard control system based on machine vision, machine voice 
recognition, and machine comprehension of the commander's 
speech, will systematize, summarize, and depict the tactical 
situation. Hopes are also being expressed for the system's great 
potential in processing recommendations for the selection of 
tactical methods, for the employment of armaments and electronic 
warfare through human-machine dialogue. Here the system retains 
the "right" to warn the commander if it is dangerous or 
impossible to carry out his decision. Then the system can 
suggest another solution. 
  For example, let's say you have taken off to intercept an 
air 
target. In accordance with that target's maneuver shown on your 
display, your flight path is revised and a variant for the 
set-up of the air engagement is worked out. But this variant 
doesn't suit you and you enter amendments. Having received its 
assignment the computer begins to "cogitate" and then suggests 
another variant, taking into account the new parameters of the 
situation. You accept it and on the display in numerical and 
graphic form the zone boundaries are depicted along with the 
time for the launching of the missiles or the employment of 
another type of armament. Then, with your agreement, the target 
is hit in the first and subsequent attacks. 
  But now the battle is over, and it turns out that the fuel 
reserve is insufficient to return to your airfield. During the 
engagement this information was not put out over the display so 
that you would not be distracted, since the information was not 
urgent enough. Now, however, by way of alternatives the computer 
recommends landing at one of the reserve airfields. Having 
glanced at the display, however, you reject that, knowing that 
at that airfield the airstrip is damaged. The next variant 
suggested by the computer is acceptable and then it assigns you 
a flight mode to proceed to a landing. 
  This dialogue system at the command post and in the air is a 
great, as yet unrealized, business. The computer prompts the 
commander as to what he needs to do, what comes after what, what 
along with what is inexpedient. But then either an idea occurs 
to the commander that requires immediate implementation, or a 
doubt. And then begin the clarifications, the corrections, and 
even the "wranglings" with the computer, which remembers the 
finest nuances and details of the situation if the fatigued or 
absent-minded commander forgets them. 
  What is concealed in the "soul" of the electronic intellect? 
We won't exaggerate the potential of the dialogue system and 
other systems. They are completely determined by the models 
installed in them, by what was considered in them and how, and 
they will never be able to become phenomenal robots or the 
cybernetic likeness of a commander. We can only speak of means 
which, to one extent or another, amplify or broaden the 
intellectual capabilities of the commander. 
  In order to skillfully combine the inquisitive mind of the 
commander with the rapid and accurate calculations of the 
computer, you need to develop, if it can be expressed in those 
terms, computer literacy, computer culture, and they should 
begin with a basic psychological revolution in consciousness in 
relation to automation. Will the commander judiciously evaluate 
the computer's recommendations if he doesn't understand the very 
process of its operation, if he doesn't know what a computer can 
and cannot do, if he is not familiar with that complex of 
factors which its creators considered for the model installed in 
it, or with the limiting conditions or the accepted allowances? 
  And one more thing. Computers dash old conceptions about 
leadership methods. They require a different way of thinking on 
the part of the commander and the CP team, a different quality 
of work at automated work stations, an extremely clear-cut 
differentiation of the duties of the personnel in order that 
they can carry out their functions without unnecessary commands 
and questions. In order to do this, in addition to his purely 
commander-oriented and traditional skills for leading his 
subordinates, the commander should possess the skills of an 
operator steering a piece of complex technical equipment. Just 
as other members of the CP team, the commander needs to know how 
to quickly read and analyze symbols, forms containing letters 
and numbers, and other designations on the screens of the 
situation indicators. He must be able to work with a keyboard, 
to retrieve the necessary information from the data base, to 
enter command and control commands, expressing the complexity of 
his thought in an extremely clear-cut manner using the limited 
capabilities of the technical means. And all of these operations 
must be carried out without hesitation; otherwise, the time 
gained, thanks to the computer's rapid operating speed, will be 
wasted. 
  It is as if they are both simple, easy to understand, and 
subjective -- the fast operating computer and the experience of 
the commander. But, imagine how long and labor-intensive the 
work of those people is in order to train or "bring to life" the 
computer, to develop their mathematical and program support, how 
the titles alone of the input data they have to enter and 
consolidate in the automatic control system need to be worked 
out. But, you see, without the computer program the computer is 
nothing but an "empty brain," an expensive but useless piece of 
equipment. Yes, "service" entails a lot of preliminary work, but 
it's difficult to get along without it. 
  The role of the commander is also great here. He must know 
on 
what basis the problems are programmed, especially with 
contradictory data, and the principles for forming computer 
algorithms for processing information; otherwise, it will be 
difficult to have a formalized conception of the operations and 
phenomena which must be replaced with the models realized within 
the computer and to correctly put the problem to specialists and 
work in close contact with them. 
  Such are the demands of time. That's the way it is today. 
Whether we want it or not, whether we like it or not, we either 
love computers or cannot stand them from the time we are 
children, but we've got to use them. The commander who doesn't 
learn to deal with computers as freely as he deals with plotting 
boards and indicators will soon be likened to someone who 
doesn't know how to read or write. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The CP lives by combat. Here all the threads of command and 
control meet and are held in the hands of the CP team headed by 
the commander, an outstanding individual possessing superior 
business-like qualities and talent, reacting quickly and 
correctly to changes in the situation. His subordinates use the 
commander as their standard. They notice how confidently he 
gives his instructions, how the chiefs converse with him. This 
is how it should be. 
  Command and control has never been considered easy. Just 
look 
at yourself, commander. Don't you make mistakes from time to 
time in your decisions as a result of not fully evaluating the 
situation? Are you always fair in your dealings with your 
subordinates? Doesn't your automated work station oppress you, 
and don't you cover your eyes if these indicators of your 
managerial activity oscillate somewhere on the level of 
mediocrity? 
<H5>  Chapter VIII. Know How to Overcome Yourself </H5>
<H5>  1. The Burdensome Time of Mental and Psychological Stress </H5>
  Air combat is packed to the limit with difficult tactical 
situations. The enemy might act within any altitude range, from 
the most unexpected directions, using all types of armaments and 
radar jamming. It is precisely with such a resourceful, 
well-trained enemy that the fighters will have to meet in a 
heated dogfight. 
  To achieve victory in battle each pilot should have 
confident 
mastery of his aircraft and armaments, and be able to quickly 
and correctly use the tactical methods which are specifically 
appropriate for the given situation. But what do the 
mental-psychological and combat morale qualities mean for him. 
  In brutal dogfights fraught with the unexpected, where just 
one false maneuver can cost a life, pilots experience, among 
other things, severe mental and psychological stress. Everyone 
has developed a sense of self-preservation, which weighs on the 
psyche, melding from time to time reason and will, and one must 
know how to overcome this. However, not everyone can or wants to 
experience hardship and danger. A human being is a great master 
when it comes to that which he desires. Self-deception, which is 
based on subconscious fear, can easily become conviction. 
  In this regard it is apropos to make a short excursion into 
the history of World War II, where there was not a dearth of 
dangerous, psychologically difficult situations, to recall 
long-standing events. 
  All sorts of things were happening at that time, all sorts 
of 
people were at the front. Back then cowards and panickers, 
thrown by their leaders into combat, were treated with contempt 
and anger. 
  And the reason for those unseemly actions, in my view, can 
be 
traced, above all, to the fact that the pilots had not been 
trained for an encounter with dangers in a mental-psychological 
sense. 
  Here is a tragic episode. It happened at the 762nd fighter 
aircraft station in July 1943 the second day after the battle of 
Kurskaya began. The air was simply swarming still with 
"Messerschmidts" and "Junkers." An eight-aircraft element of 
Yak-7 fighters under the command of squadron commander Captain 
L. Avyekov took off to provide cover for the troops. Having 
detected two groups of nine "Junkers" flying under the cover of 
"Messerschmidts" the commander made a daring decision: to attack 
the first group of nine aircraft with three pairs and to provide 
cover for our actions with the fourth pair. However, when we 
went over to the attack, instead of our own covering pair we saw 
a line of "Messerschmidts." The subsequent events developed 
rapidly; an attack didn't come off. 
  Returning to the airfield after this grave, unsuccessful 
engagement we did a great deal of thinking. Either the fascists 
shot down the pair providing cover, or they didn't know their 
tactic well enough and didn't know how to get into the 
engagement. But it was something else. When, after landing, we 
saw the "missing" pair of aircraft on the ramp and asked the 
leader why it happened like that, he irresolutely alluded to 
engine trouble. Right! We understood that he, by the way, a 
pretty good pilot, had simply gotten cold feet. That was 
cowardice that turned into a crime. 
  We could recall even more acute, critical situations which 
occurred in the war years and also in our time. All of them are 
a grim reminder that you cannot completely rely only on the 
piloting technique and the tactical training of pilots. One must 
not forget about the high level of mental and psychological 
stress that they are experiencing. Could you weigh their burden, 
measure and compare the end results of battle? In aviation, 
unfortunately, there are not yet the appropriate statistical 
data and tangible indicators to make such estimations. But one 
can judge that these stresses are not all that harmless from the 
research conducted in related fields. 
  Thus, foreign military psychologists calculated that out of 
the 1,630,000 army veterans in the USA who participated in World 
War II, approximately one million suffered from various 
psychological disorders and were subjected to the appropriate 
treatment. Of them, 545,000 were immediately pronounced unfit 
for further service. (TRUPPENDIENST. 1982. No. 1.) The 
correlation between psychological and physical traumas in the 
Israeli army was 3:10 in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973 and 2.3:10 
in the war in Lebanon in 1982. (MILITARY REVIEW. 1985. N0. 7.) 
Statistics and indicators are quite eloquent, aren't they? 
  And now we return to mental and psychological stress in the 
course of our combat training. Without these stresses here we 
also couldn't get along, but in peacetime, when there is no real 
enemy in the air, these stresses manifest themselves in a 
different way. 
  Each new generation of fighter aircraft distinguishes itself 
from the preceding one not only with its improved 
aviational-tactical features and its weaponry, but also with the 
increased emotional and nervous tension which the pilots 
experience. A contemporary fighter aircraft is the focus of 
electronics, automation, and the most complicated systems. Now 
an integral part of the onboard systems, they introduce 
substantial changes in the work of flying, they facilitate it so 
much that it seems as if the automatic system itself could 
control the airplane. 
  However, the most highly perfected equipment does not 
relieve 
the pilot of the oppressive time of psychological and mental 
stress and never will. It just takes on a new quality. It has 
been determined, for example, that when flying faster than the 
speed of sound the pilot performs various operations 6-8 times 
more than when traveling at speeds below the speed of sound. 
This means that when controlling the aircraft he should make 
decisions faster. A delay of even a few seconds could lead to 
irreversible consequences. Therefore, although the flight speed 
alone does not have a direct influence on the pilot's body, its 
psychological effect is very tangible. The need for highly 
accurate, coordinated movements and the combination of them with 
complicated thought processes in multi-mode flight leads to an 
increase in emotional tension. Therefore, as the saying goes, 
the pilot is constantly fired up. He has a sense of heaviness, 
of fatigue, he doesn't always manage to work out a rhythm to his 
thinking in order to interpret and process the information he 
has received. 
  Now imagine that this new generation of fighters has just 
arrived at your unit. To learn a new aircraft -- that is the 
hidden desire of every pilot. You want to sit in the cockpit as 
soon as possible and take off. But here is one more episode on 
the psychological plane. 
  For a long time you have been flying a type of fighter that 
you have already mastered; you know it down to the "last nuts 
and bolts"; you feel completely in charge in the cockpit. You 
approach the new unfamiliar aircraft with this feeling. 
  Confidence in one's own strengths is a valuable quality. It 
enables a pilot to discover his own capabilities to the fullest 
extent, to better perform the most complex tasks. But, on the 
other hand, as strange as it may seem, your former skills -- 
complex conditioned reflexes, can become an unforeseen obstacle 
in mastering the new equipment. The thing is, aircraft not only 
have similarities in their general principles of control, they 
also have differences. Therefore, the influence of old skills on 
the new ones is two-fold: either positive, or negative. In 
either case the previously acquired experience will show, and it 
won't always be useful. 
  The new aircraft has an unusual form, a different nose droop 
angle in the forward part of the fuselage, a different cockpit. 
There in the cockpit behind the smoky light is the realm of 
levers, toggle switches, familiar and unfamiliar instruments. 
The physical essence of the ongoing processes in the onboard 
equipment is changing, for example, in the automatic control 
systems and in the piloting and navigational systems. In 
addition, the piloting technique of the former and the new 
aircraft sometimes differs substantially in the degree and rate 
of motion of the control levers and the pedals and in proportion 
to the increase in the sensitivity of the new aircraft to the 
tilting of the control surfaces, precision is required in 
distributing and changing your focus of attention. 
  These constructive changes, depriving the pilot of his usual 
reference points, and the parting with the former piloting 
techniques give rise to additional psychological stress and it 
doesn't go easy on either the experienced pilot or the young 
pilot. The new skills have not yet taken shape and the old ones 
already can't be used to their full extent. 
  I don't think that I'll meet with objections if I say that 
transferring your skills from one aircraft to another is not 
only keeping in step with technological development, but it is 
also a surmounting, even a breaking of established patterns in 
one's consciousness, patterns leading to the automatism of 
pilots' actions with the aircraft control systems. There needs 
to be a restructuring of skills, but the established 
habits/patterns prevent a pilot from perceiving this difference, 
from going beyond the limits of the usual and mastering an 
aircraft that requires a different type of piloting. 
Psychologically, pilots are unequally prepared for that. The 
novelty and complexity of the technology could give rise to both 
unnecessary emotional experiences and caution (this is the 
antipode of the concept "confidence in one's own powers"), as 
well as self-confidence (as mentioned above). In conjunction 
with the still insufficient depth of knowledge and the lack of 
necessary skills, they will hardly be capable of quickly 
mastering a new aircraft. The practice of switching pilots from 
conventional to jet aircraft in the post-war years showed that 
the main feature determining success was the emotional factor 
associated with the novelty and the dissimilarity of the 
equipment. 
  To master a fighter equipped with the newest control 
systems, 
with different sighting-surveillance devices, with missiles, to 
learn to pilot it, is not a simple matter. But the burden of 
mental and psychological stress becomes heavier when the pilots 
are subjected to extreme situations which we call special cases 
in flight. 
  In our time aviation technology has become more reliable. 
Everything has been done to make flight safe, and not every 
pilot will experience that extremely unpleasant feeling one gets 
when an engine or equipment fails, or in other similar 
unforeseeable situations. The majority of aviators have not run 
up on situations like this in their entire flying careers. But, 
on the other hand, the increased reliability of the equipment 
gives rise to an exaggerated sense of well-being in pilots. 
Their "contribution" is now being made by the automation of 
aircraft control. Actually, this is a double-edged weapon. 
Observing the instrument readings isn't equivalent to active 
operations. When a man participates directly in aircraft control 
he reacts incomparably more quickly to breakdowns than when 
aircraft control is automated. In order to compensate for this 
circumstance, he needs to maintain a greater degree of vigilance 
in flight, to be in constant readiness to act in the event of 
sudden breakdowns. But this means that pilots' nervous and 
psychological stress will by no means decrease. 
  Much has been written about the effect of extreme situations 
on a pilot's actions. It is still important for us to know that 
the more reliable the equipment is and the less likely it is to 
break down, the more unexpected these breakdowns are and the 
more difficult it becomes to act. Let's consider one more trait 
of the human psyche -- the fear of the unknown. It has been 
noted that ignorance, as well as incomplete information, have a 
negative effect on a person and reduce his emotional stability, 
give rise to a feeling of uncertainty and sometimes confusion. 
  Pilots who have been in acute, critical situations when it 
was necessary to act swiftly and precisely say that the hardest 
thing was to determine the root of the situation and to 
determine its cause. A good illustration of this point is found 
in the story I heard told by a pilot at one of the aviation 
units. 
  ...Carrying out the mission at an altitude of 12,000 meters, 
I was going along, climbing slightly, when I saw on the speed 
indicator that I was rapidly losing speed. What could have 
happened? Having decided that the engine thrust was decreasing, 
I brought the aircraft into horizontal flight, but the speed 
continued to decrease. I shifted into descent. I quickly lost 
altitude and I realized that to hesitate or to make a mistake 
could mean death. Alas, that only aggravated the situation. A 
feeling of heaviness came over my whole body, an unpleasant 
sense of uncertainty in my own actions and fear of the unknown. 
My hands seemed like they belonged to someone else, they didn't 
obey me. I began to doubt the readings on all the instruments, 
my gaze literally dashed all over the instrument panel. Under 
normal circumstances I could see all of the instruments well, 
but then in that incomprehensible situation my perceptions were 
dim. I could only determine that the needle of the vertical 
speed indicator showed descent. Constantly thinking about what 
had happened, which instrument was wrong, it didn't occur to me 
to report to the flight director. 
  But then I could tell from the aircraft control stick that 
the speed of the aircraft had quickly increased; I heard the 
noise that is characteristic for flight at a very great speed, 
and I understood: the speed indicator had broken down. The 
tension immediately subsided, and then I could clearly make out 
on the instrument dials: rpms normal, oil temperature and 
pressure in the engine -- unchanged. The ability to sense the 
aircraft's operation by sound, and the knowledge of its behavior 
at various flight speeds had saved the day. I went over to 
piloting the aircraft using the back-up instruments and safely 
returned to the airfield. 
  The frank confession of a rather experienced pilot who found 
himself for the first time in a critical situation and his 
actions under the influence of paralyzing fear is 
understandable. He wasn't psychologically hardened enough to be 
able to maintain his cool, his calculating nature, his 
self-control. It's hard to say whether this pilot could have 
spoken so openly about this flight if it had taken place at a 
lower altitude. 
  I propose that we examine one more situation, which at first 
glance is not similar to the previous one. 
  A fighter was taking off, swiftly gaining speed on the 
takeoff run. It was already time to raise the front wheel when a 
red light -- the danger signal, flashed before the pilot's eyes. 
In the cockpit the signal light "oil pressure falling" blazed 
on. The pilot braked and aborted the takeoff. Looking in the 
periscope the pilot saw that the tail of the aircraft was 
blanketed in a cloud of whitish smoke. Without thinking, he 
leaped from the cockpit and quickly ran away from the plane. 
  Stop reading now, and, after laying your book aside, think. 
We can anticipate your answers right now. 
  "The pilot's actions were correct," says the cautious 
reader. 
"The situation was threatening the safety of the flight." 
  "No," objects the thoughtful reader, "even though in itself 
such a situation did threaten the safety of the flight, the 
pilot did not have the right to abandon a disabled aircraft on 
the landing strip." 
  "And what about the smoke that the pilot noticed behind the 
plane?" 
  "That was more likely than not a cloud of steam from the 
kerosene that got on the heated turbine after the engine was 
shut down." 
  Who is right? I suppose that you should go along with the 
evaluation of the thoughtful reader. And actually, if the pilot 
had looked at one more instrument after the false activation of 
the signal lights he would have seen that the oil pressure had 
not fallen and that there was no cause for hasty actions. The 
abandonment of a disabled aircraft on an airstrip created a 
dangerous situation for other pilots making landing approaches. 
  It remains for us to explain why, then, the pilot was unable 
to correctly analyze the unexpected situation. 
  "Inadequate familiarity with the equipment, insufficient 
training," quickly responds the cautious reader, without 
pondering, and he would be correct. 
  "And insufficient psychological training," adds the 
thoughtful reader, and he would also be correct. 
  The cause of hesitant, erroneous actions, as a rule, is a 
weak knowledge of the equipment. "That which I don't know, I 
fear" is a timeless truism, not only for pilots. But judge for 
yourself. Today aviation technology has become so complex that 
in order to service it, not to mention to correct malfunctions, 
as many as ten specialists are required, including engineers. Is 
it then within the powers of one pilot laboring under an acute 
deficit of time in flight to know the equipment well enough to 
instantly recognize the breakdown, its cause, and to make the 
sole correct decision? That is why there has long been and why 
the concept for aiding the pilot in decision-making in 
extraordinary situations brought on by the equipment itself 
continues to make inroads. 
  We have already discussed in Chapter II onboard automated 
self-diagnostic systems and systems for correcting malfunctions, 
which support flight safety. Now it is important for us to 
explain why a person who has mastered equipment sometimes 
becomes flustered, bluntly put, why he acts incompetently if he 
has to act under difficult circumstances. 
  There is little fuel in reserve, the weather conditions are 
harsh, the airfield is unfamiliar, a group air engagement is 
being conducted at low altitude, and in addition to the threat 
of crashing into the ground, there is the added threat of 
colliding with the other aircraft of the group, -- all of these 
external irritants can have a great influence on a pilot's 
psychological stability. We know of an incident where, under 
similar grave circumstances, the flight director gave the 
command over the radio "Eject!", but didn't give the radio call 
letters. Upon receiving this unaddressed command, a pilot for 
whom the message was not intended, abandoned his aircraft. 
  We don't wish to bring the reader into the discussion of 
this 
situation. We leave it to the conscience of the flight director. 
But here is what comes from reading. You don't have safety 
unless you have an understanding of the actual danger. There 
isn't a pilot who has not been subjected to the emotional 
influence of extreme situations, and the behavior of each pilot 
is different. Some react calmly and confidently receive and 
analyze a quantity of information, which under normal 
circumstance would be impossible to process. Others lose their 
self-control, commit errors, their ability to perform is 
drastically decreased. Why? Perhaps the secret lies in the fact 
that they are inadequately trained. Not just that. In his time 
the famous Soviet pilot M. Gromov said: "In order to fly safely, 
it is very important to know how to comport oneself, how to 
overcome fatigue, uncertainty, and your own fear." 
  And so, in striving to overcome ourselves, we stop to ponder 
two problems: what do we do to prevent the pilots' reactions 
from being dulled, so that their mental and psychological 
stability is not decreased when they find themselves in extreme 
conditions; how do we learn to engage in combat and conduct it 
while maintaining clearness of thought and level-headedness, not 
yielding to fear and weakness of will. 
  When discussing these problems one must keep in mind the 
totality of the factors giving rise to psychological stress 
among flight personnel and to those factors, of a contrary 
nature, which contribute to mental and psychological 
conditioning (figure 42). Of course, the simplified picture does 
not convey the entire diversity of these factors. But in this 
case it is important to systematize only those factors which 
will be reflected in our story. In addition, one should not 
forget that a high degree of nervous psychological stress should 
not be considered only as a negative phenomenon for pilots. This 
is the normal reaction of any human being's body in response to 
an increase in the intensity of work or to the presence of 
danger. It is simply needed to mobilize the body's forces, to 
increase psychological and physical endurance.

<H5>  2. Is Bravery Necessary in Air Combat? </H5>
  This question implies a simple answer: without bravery 
achieving victory over the enemy is unthinkable. However, not so 
long ago I happened to be an involuntary witness to a curious 
argument apropos this matter. Waiting to receive the command to 
depart, some pilots whiled away the time. After their encounter 
the day before with veterans of a unit which had participated in 
World War II, they were all impressed with the recollections of 
fearlessness, of the unprecedented bravery of the comrades in 
arms, of the heated dogfights in the skies on the front. 
  "And anyway, the romance of such dogfights is gradually 
disappearing from our lives, and along with it bravery and 
valour," said the echelon commander, air force pilot 1st class 
Captain L. Ryzhkov. "Now in air combat you sometimes don't even 
see your enemy." 
  "But is the enemy of today really less dangerous or less 
insidious than the fascist aces?" the other pilot tried to 
object. "And do you really think that less bravery is required 
today in order to achieve victory in combat?" 
  "Combat conditions are not the same," Ryzhkov stubbornly 
continued. "Judge for yourself," he turned to ask for support 
from those around them listening with interest to the argument. 
"Like infantrymen meeting in hand to hand combat the fighters 
approached the enemy, penetrated into the very depth of the 
enemy's battle order, shooting down the Hitlerites at point 
blank range. Just as a lot less bravery is required of a soldier 
firing a rifle compared to one wielding a bayonet, the same is 
true of a pilot launching long-range missiles and destroying an 
air target before he sees it with his own eyes. That is why, 
first and foremost, our work requires a jeweller's precision in 
calculations, accurate aiming, actions which are perfected to 
the point that they are automatic, but by no means does it 
require bravery. Indeed, the concept of `bravery' is becoming 
meaningless." 
  "You are forgetting about close maneuvering air engagements 
where the enemy is suddenly right in front of you..." 
  "If you don't know how to competently conduct long-range 
combat," Ryzhkov ironically continued his colleague's thought. 
"But, why count on incompetence? I'll tell you something else," 
growing angry and not allowing anyone to voice his objections, 
he raised his voice. "As long-range weapons are developed, 
direct contacts with the enemy in all cases are disappearing, 
and along with them bravery and heroism." 
  The command to depart interrupted the officer's speech and 
Captain L. Ryzhkov's pair took off to intercept an air target. 
The argument was not finished. 
  Let's see how the pair's flight went. All the pilots' 
thoughts were concentrated on one thing: to find the "enemy" and 
to swiftly attack it. But the target went under cover of jamming 
and performed a hard maneuver. They were unsuccessful in guiding 
the fighters onto the target from the CP. Then the leading pair 
received the command to seek out the target on their own. It was 
not easy to find the target without help from the ground against 
the background of jamming, and it became even more difficult for 
the pilots when they detected the target in a place where they 
had not expected it at all. In order to get into the necessary 
position for attack the pair had to execute a series of drastic 
and complex maneuvers. Finally, in the fighters' sights the 
harmless sign of the target lit up steadily and they executed a 
"missile launch" at the given range. 
  It looked like Ryzhkov, who had started the argument before 
the mission was flown, was right. The interception was 
difficult, but, in essence, everything came down to accurate 
work with the weapons radar, knowledge of piloting technique, 
and the use of well-known tactical methods. He rather 
accurately reflected the crux of the changes going on in 
aviational armaments. It is no longer necessary for aircraft 
crews armed with long-range missiles to approach the enemy to 
the point where there is visual contact. The battle can be 
completed at the point where earlier the approach had only 
begun. Of course, the inconclusiveness of the results of the 
attack assumes a high degree of responsibility on the part of 
the pilots for its success, but, on the other hand, the 
attacking aircraft is farther and farther away from the enemy. 
This creates an illusion of one's own safety and reduces the 
emotional stress. But, then, the enemy in this interception only 
defended himself, and the battle itself was a training exercise. 
  Yes, the pilot in a long-range air battle does not see the 
enemy, but to make up for that he is under constant observation 
(remember the AWACS system) and there is the continuous threat 
of a sudden missile strike (the enemy also has new armaments). 
Such factors have broadened the spectrum and scale of dangerous 
situations considerably. 
  Consider the state of a pilot who does not see the enemy, 
who 
can't act against it, but at any moment he expects a strike, and 
you will understand what a feeling of defenselessness he is 
experiencing, what psychological stress, what prolonged nervous 
tension is engendered by the invisible threat with which pilots 
must constantly clash. And everyone knows that the enemy will do 
everything in order "to blind" the interceptors with powerful 
radioelectronic countermeasures, to frustrate their strike from 
the maximum range, and the long-range engagement will develop 
into a close one, which Captain Ryzhkov has tried to discount. 
  Having read Chapter II the reader already knows where close 
combat takes place. In spite of the omnipresence of 
radioelectronic equipment and the greater launching range of 
missiles, close combat will not only remain, but will find a 
wider range of usage. We will not repeat ourselves. One thing is 
clear: Contemporary combat requires decisive actions to the 
point of daring, but when faced with the enemy these give way to 
anxiety, doubt, and fear of responsibility for one's decisions. 
But if in a calm situation the pilot confidently flies his 
aircraft, acts perfectly, is considered a master of his 
business, it is still not known how he will conduct himself when 
he encounters the actual enemy. Won't it seem to him or won't he 
imagine that every step of the way danger is lying in wait for 
him, danger that in actuality is not that great? Usually people 
with these qualities do not act in the best manner. 
  And so, is bravery a necessity in combat? Doubt in this 
engenders in the consciousness of people who are far from 
detached, the erroneous, but, obviously, for them convenient 
opinion that it is not all that necessary. Deception in itself 
is intolerable because it implies the underestimation of the 
enemy, and, moreover, cowardice. How then can one teach young 
pilots to suppress and block out fear and uncertainty, to 
develop the capacity for mental self-encouragement, 
self-control; how can bravery, or, in a broader sense, high 
levels of morale and aggressiveness in combat be taught? 
  These questions are not synonymous. Here, as nowhere else, 
the limited nature of the old forms of combat training and the 
inertia of thought and of old habits have left their mark, and 
we are experiencing the results to this day. It must be 
confessed that not all that long ago we judged the development 
of the level of morale and aggressiveness in combat in extremely 
simplistic terms and with totally unjustified optimism. 
  Who does not know that practice is needed to instill these 
qualities, that they are inculcated under difficult situations 
approximating combat activity? Nobody teaches as effectively as 
an enemy acting actively, daringly, and unexpectedly. The very 
circumstances force the pilots to mobilize all their powers and 
will for victory. A passive enemy, who carries out all of his 
tasks according to the book will not teach but will only create 
the impression that it is a relatively easy and simple task to 
achieve victory over him. 
  But peacetime is not war where dangers are real and deadly. 
That is why we must not now avoid the specific conventions and 
limitations which are dictated by the strict rules of flight 
safety. To close one's eyes to that contradiction would be like 
an ostrich escaping danger by hiding its head in the sand. We 
have already run up against this situation when formulating 
tactics (see Chapter V) and we know how dearly this can cost. 
  The most surprising thing is that the task of making the 
circumstances approximate combat activity does not have any 
obvious opponents. Everybody is "for" it. Numerous official 
directives, training manuals, and articles in military journals 
fight for this. 
  So many impassioned statements have been made in the 
struggle 
with simplifications and indulgences made to the worn-out target 
for criticism. We'd like to avoid didactic instructions, but 
what can you do when you hear things over the radio like: 
  "`Big', don't turn, we need a picture for the record." This 
"brave" pilot prevails upon the crew of the target aircraft that 
he is attacking and "big," curtailing the maneuver, shifts into 
horizontal flight. 
  And so it happened that with the general approval of a very 
sound slogan, practically all the responsibility for fulfilling 
it was taken away from the commanders. It came to the point 
where the only criterion for their work was that their flight 
operations be accident-free and that they have a plan for 
attack. Alas, in itself a great "fake" attack still does not 
teach bravery, self-control, or presence of mind. 
  The power of the inertia of thought and of conceptions which 
have formed over years is great. The stagnations, 
oversimplifications, and overcautiousness which have developed 
in the course of many years continue at times to be difficult to 
overcome in the quest to develop combat morale attributes among 
pilots. They are very much alive in our consciousness and 
traditional ideas. We are accustomed to using the well-worn 
words "bravery" and "courage" both in and out of place, to 
glibly rattle them off. In this way the essence of these very 
important ideas is devaluated, and then, the main sphere of 
activity of the commanders and political officers, their great 
personal responsibility for instilling their staff with high 
levels of morale and combat aggressiveness. 
  We intentionally laid it on a little thick in order to show 
the entire complexity of the contradiction: safety through 
danger. How then do front line aviation commanders resolve this 
contradiction; how can they successfully put pilots in really 
difficult training situations? 
  "In the regular forces soldiers roll around in tanks, 
missilemen have to their credit battle-noise simulators, smoke 
candles, tape recordings of the roar of diving aircraft, 
comprehensive training; in the radiotechnical troops morale and 
combat aggressiveness are taught using sudden radar jamming," 
one of the commanders told me not long ago. "But we aviators 
only have one way -- to simulate a complex air picture with all 
its difficult to resolve situations, but to simulate it so that 
it integrates tactics not only to train the crew professionally, 
but also in a mental and psychological sense. Without this close 
interdependence it would be impossible to instill the pilots 
with a sense of military duty, a belief in their powerful 
armaments, a will for victory, and finally, bravery. 
  "As before, we thoroughly study the enemy, the tactical 
ruses 
he might employ, and his capabilities, but we put our main 
emphasis on elaborating models for combat situations with 
varying degrees of difficulty. We work tactical problems into 
them which enable the simulation of such emotional factors of an 
air battle as lack of time and information, novelty of the 
situation, its danger, uncertainty, and, in so doing, we control 
the pilots' mental and psychological stress. Such models which 
create an atmosphere of creative search, of justified risk, 
impel people to acts of courage and initiative. 
  "The difficulties and dangers that pilots can encounter in 
battle are also reflected in the variants of combat actions 
which we have worked out. Perfecting these variants in practice 
flights, not breaking the rules of flight safety, we all 
understand that in battle it will be necessary to carry out 
missions under far more difficult circumstances. Persistence in 
achieving goals, keeness of wit, military cunning, the 
employment of comprehensive methods of a mental and 
psychological nature are in every way possible encouraged and 
advocated. Otherwise, our combat training will simply become 
tedious..." 
  We will interrupt the commander's story, with which one 
can't 
help but agree, and turn to the concrete matters of his 
squadron. They are not at variance with his words. Here truly 
the kind of situation is created which requires the bravery and 
valour of the pilots. For example, in the squadron the rule has 
been laid down to "destroy the enemy" with the first attack. But 
how can this be achieved if the pilot does not approach the 
target undetected, if he is not able to execute a daring 
maneuver, if the attack itself is not daring and fulminant and 
the "enemy" does not have time to react to it? 
  "The second attack might be the last for a fighter," a 
squadron commander in my presence told one of his pilots, who 
had complained about the mission being deliberately complicated. 
"Forget that the enemy here is simulated." 
  Yes, destroying a target on the first attack is not a task 
for the timid. Here conditionalities are reduced to a minimum. 
The tension in the squadron is even greater when intercepting 
radio-controlled targets. The pilots know that after pressing 
the ordnance release button it is not a photographic target hit 
verification device that is put into action, but a missile which 
bursts out from under the wing towards the target. And if there 
is no cloud from the explosion bursting in the sky and the 
ground is not strewn with shapeless fragments, long after the 
fact you still have to put up with the scornful glances of the 
commander and your comrades. 
  These training routines, somewhat similar to the routines on 
the front, show that bravery has not lost its meaning in our 
times either. No matter what heroic deeds the pilots perform, 
there is such bravery hidden behind that humdrum routine! The 
ability to withstand great mental and psychological overloads, 
maintain self-control and the readiness to take a risk -- all of 
this is bravery. 
  And yet, bravery alone is of little worth, if it is not 
based 
on a profound knowledge of technology, if it is not bolstered to 
a great extent by tactics. It is not all that easy to achieve 
victory over the enemy of today. He is fairly well armed and 
trained. One must be able to take into consideration all aspects 
of the air picture, and to have skillful mastery of the 
armaments. Courage and readiness to perform a heroic deed are 
borne of persistent labor. Three-time Hero of the Soviet Union, 
Marshal of Aviation I. Kozhedub, said that he had been convinced 
many times: bravery without conditioning is like a blank round. 
If one lacks enthusiasm, then one lacks the desire to become a 
hero. This might be enough just for a brief flash, but not for a 
long persistent struggle, because a struggle is work, and work 
requires skill. But one cannot achieve victory over an enemy 
without bravery. Without bravery a pilot will not set out to 
perform a heroic deed. 
  However, there is another type of bravery, when a man will 
fail to realize when danger is lying in wait for him or when the 
lack of ability to realistically evaluate the situation and his 
actions makes him fearless. This bravery comes from ignorance, 
it is an irrational, presumptuous bravery associated with 
vanity, with the desire to become famous, and that simply with 
dare-devil behavior. 
  What fighter pilot is not familiar with the feeling of 
combat 
ardour, when before him is the powerful enemy, employing 
tactical ruses! The young pilot was seized by such ardour. He 
impetuously attacked the target and achieved victory. One 
circumstance, however, dampens our admiration. In the dust of 
the air battle he did not notice that he had created a G-force 
that exceeded the permissible limit -- his hands had been 
activated before his head had had time to think. 
  "A genuine fighter pilot should fight bravely in battle," 
shouted the pilot, his voice breaking, at the post-flight 
critique when the commander upbraided him for a flagrant 
violation of the flight mission and the safety regulations. 
  The commander stared at him. Anyone who has been in a 
similar 
situation knows that it is not necessary to say any more, but, 
nevertheless, he answered: 
  "In your response there was more bravado than common sense. 
Bravery was turned into the most elementary ignorance. Certainly 
one can and must improvise in battle, since battle is fighting 
against opposition, but that kind of bravery only indicates that 
you do not know how to use your aircraft's advanced 
capabilities." 
  Indeed, it is true. And today one comes across cases where 
the young pilot acting on the best motives wishes to immediately 
accomplish something heroic. Even the fear of punishment yields 
to the desire to confirm one's reputation as a daring air 
warrior. Alas, he does not yet have a real foundation under him: 
knowledge, skills, and tactical mastery. Such "bravery" of 
course is more than adequate for bragging, but not enough for an 
unrepulsble attack. 
  And so, in answer to the question posed at the beginning of 
this section, we can say that bravery was and remains a most 
important component in the level of morale and combat 
aggressiveness of all aviators. Bayonet strikes in the past 
required a great deal of bravery, but less thought and 
calculation. The essence of training today is to teach a pilot 
to think tactically and to be brave in battle. This means that 
there is now a need to more fully realize the spiritual 
potential of a man -- the combat pilot, and on a higher level. 
<H5>  3. Logical Patterns and the Unexpected in the </H5>
Morale-Psychological Sphere 
  In the sky today there is no insidious enemy that would 
strive with unexpected attacks to overwhelm the psyche of pilots 
with surprise, to deprive them of hope for victory. Of course, 
flight on contemporary fighter aircraft, as has already been 
mentioned, is also associated with considerable mental and 
psychological stress. But much of what has been predicted here 
can be attributed to logical patterns, and falls into a logical 
order. However, these logical patterns do not always work in 
harmony; from time to time they are substituted by various 
unexpected phenomena. 
  Which of our readers is not familiar with the situation 
which 
may be considered obvious: experiencing great mental and 
psychological stress, even well-trained pilots quickly become 
fatigued, their motor and intellectual reactions are reduced in 
a routine air situation, but especially in a difficult one. 
  However, the opposite also happens: a pilot acts confidently 
in a difficult situation, and in a routine one commits blunders. 
What causes this? So that the blunder is not repeated, we must 
understand, we must analyze this unexpected phenomenon. Leaving 
the reader free rein for independent thought, we will turn to 
the authorities. 
  Once the illustrious ace, Marshall of Aviation I. Kozhedub 
was asked: 
  "When did the experienced combat pilots make mistakes on the 
front?" 
  The answer was unexpected: 
  "Often this happened under the most routine of conditions, 
because they let down their guard, they lost their vigilance, 
they did not follow the air situation as carefully." 
  Actually, the history of World War II and other wars 
contains 
a host of similar examples. The same sorts of unexpected 
phenomena are also encountered in today's training routines. 
Those guilty of committing the errors are not novices but first 
class pilots whose experience should serve to perfect tactics. 
At the same time their less experienced colleagues, acting under 
the same conditions, successfully perform analogous missions. 
  Our experienced pilots should not suspect me of being 
disrespectful of them. I always have been and will be an admirer 
of their mastery of flight, but the facts are stubborn things. 
On one of his flight days the experienced pilot, as always, 
confidently took his place in the cockpit of the aircraft and, 
after starting up the engine, flew off to intercept an air 
target. The takeoff, the approach to the designated intercept 
point -- everything went as usual. The pilot received the data 
for the attack from the CP, and there on the weapon radar 
display the target blip lit up. The target didn't maneuver, it 
wasn't covered by jamming, and, therefore, there was no doubt as 
to the pilot's success. The pilot, firmly knowing the procedure 
and the flight modes for interception and not considering the 
mission difficult, did not exhibit particular zeal. When he 
received the command from the CP he made some sluggish turns to 
the correct heading, and the remaining degrees, as they say, he 
made up mentally; almost mechanically he manipulated the 
switches of the weapons radar. And what happened? The inaccurate 
execution of the CP command, the lack of urgency, the 
carelessness, the sluggish maneuver when approaching the target 
not only hindered its interception, but almost caused a grave 
incident. 
  Many at that time were puzzled as to why one of the most 
highly trained pilots, whose successes had become commonplace 
for everyone, suddenly committed errors which could only be 
forgiven of a lieutenant who had only just begun to master 
combat equipment. 
  The answer to this riddle "suddenly" was concealed in the 
officer's overestimation of his own mental and psychological 
attributes ("I know everything, I can do anything"), in his 
insufficient responsibility for the performance of the mission 
assigned him. In actual fact he had solid skills in controlling 
both his aircraft and its armaments, but he did not know how to 
control his will or his emotions, and, what is particularly 
vexing, his excessive self-confidence and conceit undermined his 
hope for accumulated experience. The pilot crawled out of the 
cockpit in confusion and said only: 
  "It's not necessary to convince me or educate me. I 
understood everything; skills have to be trained like muscles." 
  Unfortunately this is not an isolated instance. The smallest 
inaccuracies and vexing blunders lead to the same negative 
results from a pilot's lack of psychological concentration. All 
you have to do is fall asleep at the switch for a second, lose 
control of your actions for an instant, and you end up in a 
situation that is disadvantageous for combat. Having detected 
the "enemy" and skillfully exploiting the conditions of the 
situation, the leader of a pair was able to approach the target 
undetected. Tactical superiority was achieved before the battle 
even started. Exploiting this advantage the leader decided to 
attack the target simultaneously with the pair from the left, 
but instead of the command "Attack from the left" over the radio 
he uttered "Attack from the right." It is true, the leader 
immediately corrected himself, but it was too late. The reader 
has probably already guessed what the outcome of the battle was. 
Correct: the supporting aircraft dawdled a little bit, the 
"enemy" saw the fighters and started a head-on maneuver. The 
battle was lost. 
  The commander considered that the cause for this was the 
lack 
of discipline of the leader who violated the rules of radio 
communications. However, we can hardly agree with this. If his 
actions are referred to as undisciplined, then one must 
recognize them as conscious and deliberate. But that is really 
absurd. 
  Just as in the previous episode, the cause of the defeat was 
the same: the leader became complacent, let down his guard, 
allowed his attention to stray and made a slip in his speaking. 
He had flown a lot, and courageously, but with time his 
fastidiousness had eroded, and he uncritically evaluated his 
training. Is it possible to reconcile with that when the pilot, 
instead of satisfying his tactical proficiency, which can always 
be improved, experiences a false sense of infallibility and 
allows carelessness when executing a maneuver or giving commands? 
  It is human nature to make mistakes, but psychological 
mistakes are often deep-rooted and, therefore, very dangerous. 
They still need to be revealed and their causes need to be 
explained so that they can be counteracted with active 
preventative and educational measures. Sometimes the mistakes of 
experienced pilots are mentioned in passing, or not at all, so 
that their authority is not undermined in the eyes of their 
subordinates, sparing their self-esteem, hoping that the culprit 
himself will correct the "accidental" slip-up. From time to time 
such mistakes go totally "unnoticed," assuming that the fly 
won't really spoil the ointment. Then one can only console 
oneself with the fact that the negative experience in the given 
case was just as useful as a positive one, although that does 
not answer the question of what to do and how to do it in order 
to solve a new problem. 
  And what about inexperienced pilots? With them the mistakes 
have other sources. Most often they result from lack of 
knowledge and know-how, which, as has already been mentioned, 
intensifies the feeling of uncertainty and gives rise to 
excessive tension. In order to spare oneself such mistakes, it 
is sufficient to do some additional course work and training 
sessions, and to carry out a few flights with an instructor. 
  And here is one more seemingly obvious logical pattern: a 
rank of fighter pilots without a moment's hesitation agrees to 
carry out any mission, even the most difficult. What's wrong 
with that? The whole problem is that a pilot is untrained and 
incapable of fulfilling the flight mission, but he reports his 
readiness and then loses his presence of mind in flight, commits 
flagrant errors, and does not even accomplish the assigned task. 
Isn't his bravery deceitful? Indeed, because of it, not only 
does the interception of a, perhaps, very important target not 
take place, but the life of the interceptor is put in jeopardy! 
  What is the cause? It is based on a sense of false shame. 
How 
do you voluntarily confess and tell the commander that you can't 
manage some difficult aerobatic figure or some air combat 
maneuver that is a piece of cake for your comrades? Do you waive 
your pride, become the target for sniping in the squadron, in 
the regiment? 
  Pride, and sometimes an unfounded fear of falling into the 
category of "wimps" makes a pilot conceal his doubt a bit deeper 
within himself and urges him into the aircraft cockpit -- "maybe 
I can manage." If the flight has a satisfactory outcome, the 
pilot very rarely confesses as to what happened in the air. In 
one-man fighter aircraft, where the pilot is deprived of the 
advise and support of the other members of the crew, the sense 
of false shame is all the more dangerous. 
  A pilot who is experienced, but who has had an inadmissibly 
long break in his flight activity was assigned the task of 
intercepting an air target and what happened was what one should 
have expected: the man did not notice that the G-force had 
increased beyond the permissible limit, he lost his head, and 
the aircraft fell into a spin. We will not now judge the 
decision of the commander who assigned this task which was 
beyond the pilot's capabilities. But the pilot himself 
understood very well that he might not be able to handle the 
assignment, but he was afraid to report this. If that had been 
the case, the officer would have been given additional training 
classes and some transport flights. His prestige would not have 
suffered as a result of this. 
  I am not going to burden the reader by recounting other 
episodes where the sense of false shame stifled the voice of 
reason. I will only say that to recognize your own weakness is 
not easy and it is only within the power of men of principle who 
possess great strength of will. But this means that anyone who 
trains and leads pilots into combat must be a good psychologist, 
must understand the motives behind the actions of his men, must 
be very sensitive to those who, because of their own shyness or 
desire not to fall behind their colleagues, do not hasten to 
report their doubts. 
  For example, after an air combat flight the pilot reports to 
the eschelon commander in detail what turned out better, what 
turned out worse, he complains that he was not able, as he would 
have liked, to attack the maneuvering "enemy": 
  "I did everything as I was taught, but a headlong attack 
didn't work and I don't understand why." 
  Of course, analysis of the performance monitoring and 
recording devices puts everything in perspective, and, 
meanwhile, judging by the pilot's report, the cause of the 
failure lies in his indecisiveness and sluggish maneuver when 
approaching the target. 
  "I'm fed up with sickly people!", the indignant commander 
grumbled aloud. "They don't have enough assertiveness, they're 
afraid of being overworked." 
  The eschelon commander, the mentor and advisor came down on 
the pilot for whom something had not worked out during the 
flight, who had not been able to find the cause of the setback. 
It could be that the officer really was rather afraid of being 
overworked, but could there be another reason? Then -- a mutual 
enmity, the pilot's uncertainty about his own capabilities. And 
all around are the subordinates -- witnesses of this peculiar 
analysis of the flight. But even without being a psychologist, 
one can predict that hardly a one of them now feels like telling 
the commander about his difficulties, confessing his doubts, 
even if he had to, and the doubts remain. Without confidence in 
people, without comradery, the commander cannot achieve mutual 
psychological understanding with his men, and they cannot 
analyze the reasons for their doubts and mistakes. 
  Can it be that these unexpected phenomena, which we have 
exposed and traced in the morale and psychological plane, are 
the inevitable costs of various human temperaments which can be 
smoothed and concealed, but not totally neutralized? No, these 
unexpected phenomena confirm a position that has been known for 
a very long time concerning the preventive study and calculation 
of factors (figure 42). 
  A surprising fact: in order to understand how an airplane 
flies, the laws of aerodynamics are taught, but in order to 
understand how a pilot flies, it is not considered obligatory to 
teach the laws of psychology. And sometimes these factors, which 
would seem at first glance to be common knowledge, are scorned. 
But indeed within them are concealed a series of purely 
psychological moments, promoting the assimilation of new 
equipment, the perfection of tactical mastery.

  A man in combat should know how to overcome all difficulties 
and dangers. But he is overcoming not only these, but also 
himself. In order to manage his own will, emotions, and 
consciousness it is necessary first of all to understand himself. 
  Imagine yourself in the role of a young, energetic pilot. 
You 
are pondering an upcoming difficult flight. You want to 
objectively evaluate the dangers, to overcome your sense of fear 
of the unknown, to feel a sense of confidence in your own 
strengths. Who, but you yourself, can better judge you in all 
strictness and frankness, remembering that bravery and courage 
can be taught. And you, commander, before a flight look at each 
pilot. Eyes in a wide open stare, the brows knit or, on the 
contrary, raised high -- this is the typical expression of a 
face showing excessive tension. Will you be able to count on 
this pilot in combat? It is just not necessary to reproach him 
for timidity or uncertainty if he himself is trying to overcome 
these qualities in himself. 
<H5>  OVERT AND UNDISCLOSED SECRETS </H5>
  Before the book comes to a close, let's leaf through its 
pages and sum up what we've read. What does it mean to master 
the secrets of unrepulsable attacks? This is a book of overt 
secrets. The principle of its structure was revealed in the 
first pages. This principle recognizes completely the complex 
multi-faceted phenomena of tactics and the practical realization 
of the results achieved. 
  To master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks means: 
  --to be able to predict the course of events, to correctly 
analyze the expected situation, to prudently plan the 
engagement, to develop and employ tactical methods in various 
combinations; 
  --to be familiar with and take full advantage of the 
capabilities of your armaments, to quickly make the correct 
decisions for their employment in combat; 
  --to be able to use military strategems in order to make the 
enemy act in a way that is to your advantage and to be able to 
turn the course of the battle in the required direction; 
  --not to procrastinate in making decisions and taking 
actions, to look for and find reserves to win time when 
preparing for the flight and in combat; 
  --to competently manage the engagement from the ground and 
in 
the air, creatively combining the wealth of potential of the 
automated guidance systems with tactical thought; 
  --to possess a high level of psychological stability and 
everyday morale so that one does not waver in extreme flight 
situations and in combat with a strong enemy. 
  There are no secrets in these essentially well-known 
positions, but if you do not strive to grasp them, it means that 
you won't master the secrets of unrepulsable attacks. But that 
is not all. How do you relate to innovations in tactics, what 
are you pondering? Tactics is a creative matter. That is why, 
from time to time, secrets occur that still need to be grasped. 
  The development of the tactics of fighter aviation entailed 
quite a few steep turns. Part of what has been achieved has been 
rejected, but as a result there has been a great return. Reading 
the book and following its development, you have seen how some 
methods of military action and tactic procedures have died out 
or been thrown out, and others have been restored to life on a 
new technical foundation. 
  Not everything that was successful in combat yesterday is 
applicable today, but much remains unchanged. For example, in 
the course of many decades attacks from the side of the sun have 
played a significant role in fighter tactics. They have enabled 
aircraft to approach the enemy undetected, and climbing in the 
direction of the sun made it possible to break away from the 
enemy. Radar weapons aiming systems and guided missiles have 
supposedly brought about an unconventional form of camouflage 
using the sun. But, it turns out, that with the appearance of 
heat-seeking missiles, deviation toward the sun, which for them 
is jamming, has once again become an effective tactical method. 
Or, let's turn to weapons and attacks on head-on courses. There 
was a time when daring "suicide" pilots who had worked for these 
attacks with the emergence of missiles were ridiculed. What an 
anachronism, they say, in an age of supersonic jet technology. 
But attacks on a head-on course have not only experienced a 
revival, but they are the basis of long-range air engagements, 
and to make wisecracks sounds more like a limp joke. 
  Such is the incessant movement of tactical thought. Each 
generation of commanders and pilots reveals the secrets of 
unrepulsable attacks in its own way, based on a broader sphere 
of knowledge and its own comprehension. We go forward, we 
accumulate tactical wisdom, but aviation technology is 
perfected, the air enemy changes, and the secrets remain. The 
tactical methods found by us withstand with ever greater 
difficulty the test of time. Even in the time it took to publish 
this book, some of what has been said in it is already outdated; 
it now belongs to the past, and the future is reality. 
Therefore, in spite of the variety of the existing methods, we 
must constantly and urgently uncover the new secrets of 
unrepulsable attacks and seek ways to achieve victory over a 
strong, intelligent, and brutal enemy. These secrets are part of 
the eternal problems of tactics. No matter how much has been 
said and written about them, they will never be exhausted. 
  Something else is evident. Good tactical ideas can be 
discredited by a weak material base which does not satisfy the 
tactical requirements. There are also facts of another sort, of 
an, as we say, "local significance." Occupied with the everyday 
pressures of work, we unfortunately continue to think in 
outmoded terms, to employ tactical methods of days gone by, and 
in order to theoretically justify that way of acting, we allude 
to the rich experience of the past. But attempts to cling to old 
experience by calling it combat tradition signifies a stagnation 
in tactics. That's when "blank spaces" occur where, based on 
sound reflection, they shouldn't be. 
  But we're not talking about those "blank spaces" here. 
Unexposed secrets (the reader also encountered them on the pages 
of the book) are an objective logical pattern of tactics. Which 
aspects of today will be transferred into the future? Which 
combat action methods promise the greatest success? These are 
serious questions, and you don't have to be particularly astute 
to predict that the answers to them won't be specific enough. 
Alas, the science of tactics does not reveal its secrets that 
easily. 
  Let's just consider this: there are secrets that in the 
meantime have not been fully revealed. Ahead of us are numerous 
studies, calculations, generalizations of experience, the 
development of hypotheses, and the definition of their details. 
One thing is certain: we must seek out ways to understand 
unrevealed secrets even with the most long-term perspective in 
complex situations of conflict, in a cunning interlacing of 
combat maneuvers. 
  Looking into the future of fighter aviation tactics, we will 
see pilots conducting combat on unfamiliar aircraft, employing 
armaments and electronic warfare means which are unknown to us. 
The enemy's aircraft and armaments will be unfamiliar. What will 
be familiar is the bravery and courage, the combat activity and 
initiative, and the tactical training of the fighter pilots. 
They will remain that crystal ball through which the entire 
dialectic of the secrets of unrepulsable attacks is viewed.
