<F P=106> [Article by Yelena Tregubova: "`Reputation' Is Marching in </F>
Step with the `Patriots'; The Airing of a Victory Day Show on 
the Moscow Network Has Been Postponed"] 
  [Text] On 3 May the editorial staff of the Moscow 
Television Network (MTK) apologized to the viewing audience for 
the "teleplay" of the Continent Russia Studio that had been 
shown on the "Reputation" program on 1 May. I will remind our 
readers that the host of "Reputation," Emil Kotlyarskiy, 
complained about the plethora of shopkeepers in Moscow and said 
that he, "a native Muscovite," could remember "when the capital 
smelled only of tangerines and lollipops" and advised the 
creation of a "volunteer corps of crime-fighters." Furthermore, 
Mr. Kotlyarskiy went on to name the chief criminals. In his 
opinion, they are the leaders who caused the collapse of the 
great Union and the disbandment of the KGB. At the end of the 
program he declared that when this corps begins to fight for "a 
people's victory," the loss of human lives will be inevitable, 
but "these losses will be justified." 
  Just four days later the MTK management had to acknowledge 
that the producers of the program had effectively issued a 
televised appeal for violence and had thereby violated, at the 
very least, the law on the media. As MTK Program Director Igor 
Arbuzov assured the SEGODNYA correspondent, he saw the show for 
the first time when he was "watching TV at home." The Continent 
Russia Studio of the Congress of Russian Communities pays for 
the air time and furnishes its own videotapes. According to Igor 
Arbuzov, studio Chief Kotlyarskiy was supposed to bring the film 
to the MTK editorial office three days before it aired, but he 
brought it only on the morning of the day it was shown "and 
because of this our technicians did not have a chance to review 
it." 
  Emil Kotlyarskiy himself, however, assured the SEGODNYA 
correspondent that Mr. Arbuzov has always allowed him to bring 
the tapes for "Reputation" in on broadcast day because "the 
program director and MTK Editor-in-Chief Aygar Misan have 
treated the Continent Russia Studio with great affection and 
trust from the very beginning of our association." 
  Igor Arbuzov did not conceal his "affection" for the 
"patriotic creative team." He explained with pride that it was 
the MTK that had agreed to broadcast Kotlyarskiy's "extremely 
talented film" about Vladimir Vysotskiy a year ago (the message 
of which, viewers will recall, was that if Vysotskiy were alive 
today, he would support today's "Russian patriots"). The 
"Reputation" program has been part of the MTK broadcasting 
schedule since February of this year. One of the earlier shows 
was also debated by Muscovites for a long time because of the 
question the "Reputation" hosts had asked Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
and Chairman Dmitriy Ragozin of the Congress of Russian 
Communities: "Would it be better to be born a Jew or not to be 
born at all?" Incidentally, Mr. Arbuzov had this to say about 
that show: "There is no question that the boys have their own 
ideas about everything, but the program was quite interesting!" 
  The latest show, however, which justified the sacrifice of 
human lives for the sake of some kind of "people's victory by 
the native Muscovites" was, as Igor Arbuzov put it, "a bit too 
insensitive." It is true that Emil Kotlyarskiy said, just a few 
days after the broadcast, that what he had in mind was just the 
creation of "people's brigades, which would request permission 
to bear arms legally and would protect people from gangsters 
when they come home late at night: They could meet them at the 
subway station and walk them home, or, perhaps, screw in new 
light bulbs in dark entryways...." When he spoke of "justified 
losses," the filmmaker apparently was referring to people who 
might be killed by an electric shock when they screw a light 
bulb into a faulty fixture. 
  In the fear of possible legal action, the MTK program 
director reported that he was removing the next episode of 
"Reputation" from the program schedule for 8 May and would not 
air any other Continent Russia shows until he had "received a 
precise explanation of what had happened from the producers." 
Judging by all indications, however, this statement was purely 
declarative, and the "patriotic studio's affectionate 
association" with MTK will continue. Emil Kotlyarskiy confided 
in the SEGODNYA correspondent: "Arbuzov assured me on the phone 
that very day that the next episode of 'Reputation' will be 
shown on 15 May." It is interesting that the show that was 
planned for 8 May and was "removed from the schedule" was made 
especially for Victory Day, which many communists and "patriots" 
have chosen as "the first day of the decisive offensive." The 
25-minute program, according to Mr. Kotlyarskiy, was an excerpt 
from his film "Barricades on the Ruins of the Empire," with the 
October armed rebellion as the "main theme," interspersed with 
clips from newsreels showing, for instance, Marshals Zhukov and 
Rokossovskiy marching in the Victory Day Parade." The director 
acknowledged that the show also included "a few of my own 
comments," and that is why the film, which was supposed to have 
been shown on the eve of the communist demonstrations in the 
center of Moscow, was not only about the victory in the 
Patriotic War, but "about victory in general...." 
  Even if this film is removed from the schedule for 8 May, as 
the MTK director promised, Mr. Kotlyarskiy feels "it is certain 
to air a short time later." He said that "another appropriate 
date for a show on victory has been recommended to us: 24 June, 
the anniversary of the parade in Red Square commemorating the 
victory in the war."

<F P=106> [Article by V. Murashov and V. Peremyshlev: "All Roads Lead </F>
to the Capital"] 
  [Text] A press conference with the director of the 
Moscow railroad, I. Paristiy, took place yesterday in the 
railroad administration building. Opening the press conference, 
S. Bogatko, director of the Ministry of Railways (MPS) press 
service, told the journalists that the capital main line is a 
unique transport association, on the capability of which the 
stability of the work of the whole railroad network to a large 
extent depends. 
  It must be said that the meeting, organized by the MPS press 
service, was very crowded for the first time in many years. One 
thing indeed is clear: The problem of the largest mainline in 
the country interests both its customers and journalists. 
  It seems that there was a graphic example of the 
implementation of a currently fashionable concept--transparency 
of decisions, that is, of the actions of management. The 
conversation turned out to be frank to the utmost degree and 
maximally exhaustive. The work of the railroad and its current 
situation were presented with great clarity. 
  The impression was created that even such specific concepts 
as the technological work of the stations was not only 
understood by the journalists but sympathetically received by 
them. 
  In a brief explanation, I. Paristiy, the director of the 
railroad, recalled that the Moscow railroad was formed within 
its present boundaries in 1959. It includes 13 departments and 
the Board of Directors of international and tourist 
transportation. The length of the main railroads that have been 
developed consists of 13,500 kilometers, almost a third of the 
circumference of the globe at the equator. Seventy-one stations 
on the railroad handle arrivals and departures of passengers. 
  So it turned out that attention was indeed principally paid 
to His Majesty the passenger. And this is not surprising since 
the Moscow junction is the largest in the world with respect to 
serving passengers. It is also the largest in the railroad 
network--it accounts for about 40 percent of the passenger 
transportation in the network. In suburban rail traffic alone, 
3.5 million people make use of the services of the main line 
daily. And the situation today is such that you do not acquire 
new cars right away; the prices for new cars are such that it is 
very difficult to provide a complete stock of cars. This is 
clearly illustrated by the fact that the railroad, which in past 
years acquired 200-300 cars on average, last year added only 32 
cars. It is true, though, that this year another 50 new cars 
appeared. The situation with respect to cars for suburban trains 
can be substantially improved over time by the Demikhovskiy 
plant, one of the creators of which was B.N. Yeltsin, then first 
secretary of the Moscow City CPSU Committee. 
  Capacity load freight trains and long passenger trains--24 
cars for long distances and cars for suburban travel--have 
appeared on the Moscow railroad for the first time. Under 
conditions of general nonpayment through mutual settlements and 
barter, which have already been conducted here for five years, 
wages are being paid without delay, housing is being built at an 
increasingly rapid rate, and hospitals and polyclinics are being 
put into operation on the main railroad line. 
  We are not sitting around doing nothing, we are not waiting 
for manna from heaven, said Ivan Leontevich. And the facts bear 
this out: With a stock of suburban rail cars, 35 percent of 
which have outlived their scheduled life, the intensity of 
traffic is being maintained through the development of depot 
repair and reconstruction of repair enterprises. The tendency of 
local authorities, in particular capital and oblast authorities, 
to ignore the needs and problems of the main line has been 
successfully overcome; in the budget for the capital, R25 
billion is being designated for acquisition of rolling stock. 
  There was a very refreshing ring to the report about the 
creation on the capital main line of a sanitary zone within a 
radius of 50 kilometers of the city, about the fact that looters 
on suburban trains are subject to punishment of fines of ten 
times the minimum wage. 
  It is not possible in a short report to dwell on details. 
But 
we are fully confident that readers and listeners not only in 
the capital and the oblast but throughout Russia will learn a 
lot about the work of the Moscow railroad from the reports of 
those who were present at the journalists' press conference. 
  The one thing for which we can hope is that such productive 
meetings will be held more frequently.

<F P=106> [Article by N. Davydov: "Wages--on Time; From a Conference </F>
Call in the Ministry of Railways"] 
  [Text] The continuing drop in transport operations 
and the inoperative payments mechanism do not leave hopes for a 
quiet life for the railroad workers. Despite the fact that hauls 
of freight and passengers are being steadily achieved, the 
sector's economic situation is very alarming. As First Deputy 
Minister O. A. Moshenko emphasized in opening a recent 
conference call, approximately a third of March wages had not 
yet been financed by 12 May, although based on the dates it was 
already time to distribute those for April. 
  We have written more than once what the reasons are for such 
a situation. The problems among problems is the shortage of 
"live" money in the revenue accounts of the railroads due to the 
clients' inability to pay. It has already become a rule that in 
the best case half of the funds earned is received in money and 
the rest is mutual write-offs, the products of debtor 
enterprises, etc. But in order to pay the entire March wages 
and, let's say, half of April's before the end of May, no less 
than 924 billion rubles, which represents 57 percent of all 
earnings from transport operations, needs to be collected in the 
accounts. 
  If one considers that in April the railroads received less 
than 42 percent of the planned earnings in cash, then it becomes 
clear how difficult a task remains to be resolved. It is 
difficult to expect positive results without laborious daily 
work to reduce debts, cut expenditures and increase revenues and 
without bringing the contingent of service personnel in line 
with the volumes of transport operations, reducing outlays from 
non-intact hauls, fines for delays in the delivery of freight, 
etc. 
  And the fact is that one needs to finance not only the wage 
fund of the railroads and the plants, but also to settle 
accounts with the funds from the withholdings for social needs 
(social insurance, the pension fund, medical insurance, etc.--39 
percent all told) and with taxes into the state budget. 
  The circumstance that on a number of railroads an unfounded 
wage increase, so to speak, more than the right which the basic 
wage agreement grants, has been permitted, exacerbates the 
situation. Thus, the growing expenditures for these purposes to 
a certain degree have become the catalyst for prolonging the 
time periods for settlements with the labor collectives. They 
exceeded the wage fund (relative to December 1993) during the 
first quarter on the October and Sverdlovsk railroads by more 
than R14 billion. The overexpenditure on the West Siberian and 
Far Eastern railroads is two times less, but also very 
substantial. The rates, as we can see, exceed what has been 
planned. 
  The Ministry of Railways and the trade union central 
committee have been forced to make adjustments, since the 
accelerated indexing of wages further complicates the task of 
liquidating payment arrears. Especially as the right to 
accelerated indexing was envisaged by the basic wage agreement 
only for the first quarter. However, the leaders of the Gorkiy, 
Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk and certain other mainlines have already in 
April carried out a 12-17 percent increase in wages, although 
the forecast of the growth in consumer prices (in accordance 
with which indexing in the second quarter should be carried out) 
was no more than 10 percent and actually came to less than 9. 
  All this has been negatively reflected in the attempts to 
liquidate the wage arrears. For now they are distributed on time 
only on the Moscow and Kaliningrad railroads. This is a serious 
problem for almost all the remaining railroads. Which, as a 
matter of fact, has been confirmed by the statements of the 
leaders of the mainlines during the conference call. 
Nevertheless, the roads have supported the strategic line 
proposed by the ministry--to enter into a normal rhythm of wage 
distribution by Railroad Workers Day. 
  Briefly, the essence of the strategy comes down to the 
following. Wages for March should be fully paid before 20 May, 
for April by 15 June, for May by 5 July, and for June prior to 
30 July. Thus, we will enter into a normal payment regime with 
the June wages. That is, one needs to recover R3.3 billion in 
money from the clients, which represents 48.9 percent of planned 
earnings during this period, in two and a half months. The task 
is extremely complex but, as the discussion has indicated, 
feasible. 
  It was especially emphasized that the amount designated is 
sufficient provided that not a single ruble goes for other 
needs. There can be no such thing in life and that is why the 
task has been set of recovering no less than 60 percent of the 
earnings in money. And, what is more, of more fully utilizing 
other sources for obtaining money. 
  First, selling the products received on the debts' account 
quicker. This can yield about R100 billion every month. 
  Secondly, through other receipts (local revenues, penalties, 
fines, various services, etc.) the monthly increase can come to 
no less than another R60 billion. 
  And, finally, the ministry has called for the more active 
recovery of debts from so-called other clients. For the system 
as a whole they now owe R1.77 trillion. This is a difficult 
matter, but transportation can no longer continue to carry the 
debt. As O. A. Moshenko has emphasized, write-offs, debts, 
earnings--all must now be specifically accounted for and each 
railroad chief must have a detailed plan on his desk for whose 
implementation daily monitoring is required. 
  The conference participants have come to the conclusion that 
for the system as a whole receipts of "live" money into the 
revenue accounts of the railroads need to be increased by 6 
percent, which will permit the financing of wages in conformity 
with the schedule that has been adopted. But this is on the 
average. And the Sakhalin, Transbaykal, and Baykal-Amur roads 
need to have 65-75 percent more such earnings. The collectives 
of the West Siberian, Krasnoyarsk, East Siberian, Far Eastern 
and Kuybyshev railroads also have to put in some serious work in 
this area. 
  One cannot hush up the fact that the situation at the 
sector's plants is even worse than in transport itself. Of 
course, the amounts required here are of an order smaller but it 
is not easier for the working people of the enterprises for that 
reason. However, funds for the payment of wages to the workers 
of the Ministry of Railways' plants are also called for in the 
figure of R3.3 trillion indicated above. Serious complaints have 
been expressed to the leaders of the shipping roads which 
occasionally "forget" about their financial obligations relative 
to the transit roads. Here's a special question for 
you--recovery of debts from the railroad administrations of the 
CIS countries, which are already reaching R400 billion. 
  In summing up the conversation that had taken place, the 
first deputy minister called upon the leaders of the mainlines 
to display greater exactingness towards clients and to not 
by-pass non-traditional revenues which however directly "knock" 
against the railroad workers. And the main thing is to search 
and find unordinary ways of increasing revenues and cutting 
expenditures.

<F P=106> [Interview with A. Sidenko, deputy minster of railways and </F>
member of the Russian Federation governmental commission on the 
conduct of the 1994 spring sowing and crop harvest, by V. 
Chibisov, GUDOK correspondent: "Transport to the Village"] 
  [Text] 
  [Chibisov] The present belated spring has brought additional 
troubles to the farmers. Already in the sowing campaign a volume 
of work a third greater than last year has to be accomplished, 
since about four million hectares of arable land were not sown 
in the autumn due to a shortage of fuel and equipment. Moreover, 
many areas occupied by winter crops have suffered from intensely 
cold weather and required re-seeding. And then there are still 
high waters in many regions. The providing of the farms with 
seeds, equipment, and fertilizers also caused concern for a 
time. What is the situation now, Anatoliy Yakovlevich? 
  [Sidenko] The village always was one of the priority 
directions of their work for railroad workers. Now by tradition 
the Ministry of Railways at the beginning of the year carefully 
analyzes the results of the transfers of agricultural products 
during the past year and, in accordance with the tasks which the 
government sets for the agro-industrial complex, determines the 
specific measures regarding the organization of the delivery of 
agricultural freight. 
  And today the railroad workers are coping with the tasks set 
for them. Some 260,000 tonnes of seed grain, as was provided for 
by the plan, has been delivered to the regions of the sowing 
campaign. Not a single failure has been permitted. Our employees 
on the railroads and divisions and at the stations are 
approaching with full responsibility the fact that the timely 
performance of spring field work is to be secured by their 
participation. The last freight cars with imported seed corn 
destined for the Volga and North Caucasus regions left 
Kaliningrad a few days ago. Shipments of seed potatoes are 
proceeding actively. Almost 100,000 tonnes need to be delivered 
from Moscow, Ryazan, Orel, Ivanovo, Tambov and Voronezh oblasts 
to the northern regions--Vologda Oblast, Komi, and Karelia. Also 
to the Orenburg area and even to Chita. A special dispatcher 
group has been created in the Ministry of Railways which 
monitors applications for the shipment of this product and their 
fulfillment and tracks the movement of freight cars, etc. 
  [Chibisov] And what about fertilizers, equipment, fuel? 
  [Sidenko] A very important question for today. The villagers 
have only 21 percent of their fertilizer needs. They are being 
shipped in an uneven fashion although there is finished product 
at the plants. However, its shipment is being held back because 
of the recipient's inability to pay. The government of the 
Russian Federation has allotted credits for the purchase of 
fertilizers. State support (in the form of subsidies) of 
consumers is provided for. The fact is that now the cost of a 
single tonne of fertilizers exceeds the cost of a tonne of grain. 
  One must give the railroad workers their due in this 
situation. Despite all the complexities and the large debts of 
the shippers, fertilizers are being delivered to the village. 
  Its delivery is also connected with the same inability of 
the 
villagers to pay the producers of agricultural equipment. 
Shipment volumes come to only 30 percent of last year. 
  The picture is somewhat different with petroleum products. A 
rather alarming situation with supplying villagers with fuels 
and lubricants had developed by the beginning of spring. A 
decision has been adopted to transport them without waiting for 
the credits which the government will allot for the 
agro-industrial complex. And now there are quite enough 
petroleum products at the oblast bases of all regions to carry 
out the sowing. And what is more villagers have obtained loans 
for settling up with the producers. Stocks of diesel fuel at the 
petroleum bases now exceed last year's level by 1.5 times. 
  All this permits the conducting of spring field work in as 
short a time as possible. Practice confirms this: today more 
than 12 million hectares of spring crops have already been 
sown--higher than the level of last year. 
  [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich, tell us briefly about the 
work of the governmental commission. 
  [Sidenko] Its task is to monitor everything that is being 
sent to the agro-industrial complex for the conducting of the 
spring field work and the harvest. To comprehensively resolve 
the questions of the Ministry of Agriculture, the Central Bank, 
and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. So to avoid difficulties 
which arise, in particular, in the financial interrelations 
which confront agriculture. I think that this task is being 
fulfilled. In any case the sowing is proceeding normally. 
  And one needs to make preparations for the harvest now. The 
shipment of early vegetables is beginning for the railroad 
workers. Taking into account that the Council for railroad 
transport of the CIS has instructed the Ministry of Railways to 
manage the fleet of refrigerator rolling stock, we have 
redeployed the necessary number of cars to the early cabbage 
growing regions. Now refrigerator sections are to be found in 
Moldova, Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Moreover, instructions 
have been given to the railroads regarding the preparation of 
3,000 more such cars in order to include them in the work as 
products are presented. There is every reason to think that the 
railroad workers will cope with the shipments of the volumes of 
early vegetables envisaged by the treaties and contracts that 
have been concluded. 
  [Chibisov] We have talked about the customers' inability to 
pay. But how are the producers of products for the village 
settling up with the railroad people for shipments? 
  [Sidenko] This problem is the same for all shippers of 
freight. As a whole the debts to the railroads for shipments 
carried out come to about 2.3 trillion rubles. The suppliers of 
products for the agro-industrial complex have a large debt. 
Thus, if one takes petroleum products, it is almost R300 
billion. With respect to mineral fertilizers... the Apatity 
Production Association alone has owed R11 billion and 
Kuybyshevazot and Tolyattiazot R5 billion and R2.5 billion 
respectively. The fertilizer producers of the regions of the 
Sverdlovsk and other railroads have a sizable debt. 
  However, I repeat: we have a good understanding of the 
problem. And if we don't deliver the rolling stock for loading, 
we thereby exacerbate the situation in the country. That is why 
we are looking for the most varied forms of reciprocal 
settlements so as not to stop the shipment process short and to 
deliver all that is needed to the villagers. 
  [Chibisov] Anatoliy Yakovlevich! A purely sectorial 
question. 
A new railway traffic schedule is to be introduced on 29 May. 
What is its fundamental difference from the one now in operation? 
  [Sidenko] There are special features and significant ones at 
that. If previously we tried to create a freight traffic 
schedule intended for maximum carrying capacities and the 
greatest throughput of car flows, now it has been formulated on 
the basis of realistic shipment volumes. This has been done so 
as to not hold on to a surplus fleet of locomotives and cars and 
surplus locomotive brigades. And through this to reduce 
operating costs. 
  As for the passenger traffic schedule, its rates have been 
somewhat increased. Taking the wishes of the passengers into 
account, we have revised a number of the timetables for the 
running of trains. The new schedule makes it possible to carry 
out the capital repair of a track while not disturbing the 
rhythm of the running of passenger trains.

<H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May 1994 prices for consumer 
goods and services rose by 1.6 percent, including for foodstuffs 
and for-fee services for the population--by 1.9 percent, and 
nonfood items--by 1.2 percent. 
  The highest rate of increases in food prices was registered 
in the East Siberian region (3 percent), and the lowest--in the 
Northern and West Siberian regions (0.7-0.9 percent). Increases 
in prices for nonfood items ranged between 0.6 percent in cities 
of East Siberia and 2.2 percent in cities of the Northwestern 
region. 
  Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the 
consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the 
preceding date):

  Since the beginning of the month the current consumer 
price index measures 102.5 percent, including for 
foodstuffs--102.3 percent, nonfood items--102.6 percent, and 
for-fee services for the population--103.2 percent. 
  If the current rate of price increases remains at the same 
level, prices for consumer goods and services in May will 
increase overall by 7-8 percent. 
<H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May prices in organized and 
nonorganized trade rose by 1.2 percent and 4.9 percent. 
  Price changes by main categories of food products are shown 
below (as a percentage of the preceding date):

  In organized trade over the elapsed week fresh 
produce prices rose at an anticipatory rate: cabbage, beets, and 
carrots--by 3-6 percent, onions--by 17 percent, and apples--by 9 
percent. There was practically no change in prices for basic 
food staples: milk, bread, sugar, eggs, butter, and vegetable 
oil. 
  Similar to organized trade, the greatest price rises in 
nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh 
produce. Prices for apples, cabbage, and onions rose over the 
week by 15-18 percent, and carrots, beets, and garlic--by 4-9 
percent. Prices for pork went up by 4 percent, and milk and milk 
products--by 1-2 percent. 
  The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic 
foodstuffs increased over the week by 2.4 percent and as of 
10 May amounted to 49,700 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly 
basis. The price differential between monitored cities measured 
a factor of 4.7 as compared to 3.6 on 15 March of this year. The 
highest cost of the basket was registered in Magadan (R135,500) 
and the lowest--in Ulyanovsk (R29,000). In terms of the cost of 
the consumer basket, Moscow and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and 
45th among 132 monitored cities (R54,000 and R50,900 on a 
monthly basis). 
<H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>
  Over the period 4 to 10 May prices for nonfood items rose at 
a moderate rate. There was practically no change in prices for 
fabrics, clothing, and personal and household goods. At the same 
time there was a considerable increase in prices for certain 
medicines (by 9.9 percent), synthetic detergents, women's 
toiletries, and children's footwear (by 2.5-3.7 percent). 
<H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>
  There were no significant price increases with respect to 
consumer and transportation services over the elapsed week. 
Rents in municipal housing in Russia as a whole increased by 6.2 
percent, and the cost of some municipal services--by 8-10 
percent; rents and the cost of municipal services increased 
several-fold in Ulan-Ude, Elista, Chita, and Smolensk. 
<H5>  Industry. </H5>
  In January-April of this year Russian industry produced R77 
trillion worth of output in current prices. The physical 
volume of production declined by 25.4 percent as compared to 
January-April of last year, including in April--by 26.9 percent 
(in January-April 1993--by 18.6 percent, including in April--by 
16.4 percent). 
  Average daily production fell by 25.2 percent in April of 
this year as compared to the same month of last year, and by 3.3 
percent as compared to March of this year. 
  The volume of production fell mostly in the sectors 
producing 
predominantly capital goods and nonfood consumer items. For 
instance, while in the fuel and energy sector over the elapsed 
period of the year production fell by 11 percent and in the food 
processing industry by 21 percent, in machine building it fell 
by 45 percent, in the chemical and petrochemical industry--by 35 
percent, in the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper 
industry--by 32 percent, and in light industry--by 39 percent. 
  The number of enterprises that experienced lengthy 
stoppages of all or some parts of production increased. 
While in January of this year there were 3,800 such enterprises, 
in April the number increased to more than 5,000. The main cause 
of the stoppages is difficulties in selling output. 
  In January-April 1994, of the 406 most important categories 
of products counted in periodic reports, the volume of 
production, as compared to January-April 1993: 
  --increased with respect to 24 items, (including 
iron ore pellets, coking equipment, cash registers, sulfur, 
parquet tile, ceramic floor tile, cotton fabrics, freezers, 
mayonnaise, sausages, cheeses and feta cheese, live and salted 
fish, cognac, and toothpaste), or 6 percent of the total number; 
  --decreased with respect to 377 items, or 93 
percent of the total number. With respect to 283 items (70 
percent of the total), production declined by one-quarter or 
more; among them are lubricant oils, sheet rolled metal, 
roll-formed sectional steel, steel pipe, gas and hydraulic steam 
turbines, diesels and diesel generators, freight and passenger 
railcars, city telephone cables, metal-cutting machine tools, 
drop forges, trolley buses, tractors, friction-free ball 
bearings, mineral fertilizer, chemical insecticides, synthetic 
dyes, synthetic rubber, automotive tires, lumber, wood-fiber and 
wood-chip board, cardboard, cement, prefabricated ferroconcrete 
components, wall materials, roof slate, asbestos, ceramic 
plumbing fixtures, outer knitwear, garments, fabrics of all 
types except cotton, hosiery, footwear, sewing and washing 
machines, electric vacuum cleaners, tape recorders, radio 
receivers, television sets, cereals, and macaroni items.

products over January-April 1994 are shown below:

<H5>  Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>
  By 10 May farms in practically all regions of the Russian 
Federation were sowing spring crops. In the country as a whole, 
spring crops were planted at 19.2 million hectares, of which 
13.6 million hectares were sown with grain crops. In the 
beginning of May of this year the pace of planting slowed down. 
Last year by this time spring crops had been planted on 22.3 
million hectares, including 15.3 million hectares sown with 
grain crops.

  Spring planting is almost completed on the territories of 
the 
Central Chernozem region, Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, and 
Rostov and Ulyanovsk Oblasts, where spring grain planting areas 
exceed those of last year. 
  The greatest lag in planting spring grain crops is 
registered 
at farms in Ryazan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Samara, and Saratov 
Oblasts, where the area sown with grain crops comprises 56-70 
percent of that of last year, and Kirov Oblast--34 percent. 
  In January-April of this year industrial and 
distribution organizations shipped mineral fertilizer and 
fuel to agricultural consumers in the following volumes 
(millions of tonnes):

  The volume of petroleum products being purchased by 
enterprises through direct-delivery contracts continues to 
increase. Their proportional share in the total volume of 
deliveries comprises 12-13 percent. 
  In April of this year agricultural enterprises continued to 
increase the volume of petroleum product purchases, 
in which diesel fuel accounts for the greatest part of 
purchasing activity. As a result, over the past month stocks of 
diesel fuel at farms increased by 40 percent, and of 
gasoline--by 27 percent. At the same time, as of 1 May they had 
approximately one-third less fuel on hand than on the 
corresponding date last year. 
  Agricultural consumers have changed their approach to 
forming

substantial volumes of fuel but instead mainly buy it at 
petroleum warehouses as required by the expansion of 
agricultural work.

  At the beginning of May of this year the degree of 
readiness of fodder-harvesting equipment at Russian 
farms is below that of last year. Half of fodder-harvesting 
combines and mowers are currently in inoperable condition. 
  Shipments of greenhouse vegetables through all 
channels dropped by 21 percent over the four months of this year 
as compared to the same period of last year. Their sales to 
procurement organizations declined by one-third; sales through 
other channels (farmers markets, their own retail points of 
sale, and public catering enterprises) increased somewhat and 
accounted for one-third of the total volume of produce shipments. 
<H5>  Animal Husbandry </H5>
  In January-April of this year, as compared to the analogous 
period of 1993, quantities of livestock and poultry sold 
for slaughter by farms of all categories declined by an 
estimated 10 percent, production of milk--by 11 
percent, and eggs--by 6 percent. At agricultural 
enterprises the volume of production of meat and milk declined 
by 15-16 percent; at personal plots it remained more or less at 
last year's level. 
  A decline in the the animal herd is taking place 
mainly at agricultural enterprises where as of 1 May of this 
year, as compared to the analogous period of last year, the rate 
of herd reduction with respect to horned cattle amounted to 10 
percent, cows--7 percent, swine--14 percent, and poultry 
stocks--9 percent. Especially perceptible (almost one-quarter) 
was the decline in the herd of sheep and goats. These processes 
resulted in the changed structure of the total livestock 
herd--the proportion of horned cattle personally owned by 
individuals increased as compared to the beginning of May of 
last year from 23 percent to 26 percent, cows--from 31 percent 
to 34 percent, swine--from 27 percent to 30 percent, and sheep 
and goats--from 34 percent to 38 percent.

  Procurement of livestock and poultry from 
producers for state and regional food stocks decreased by 
one-quarter as compared to January-April 1993, of milk--by 23 
percent, and eggs--by 5 percent. At the same time, agricultural 
enterprises increased sales of animal husbandry products through 
other channels. Bypassing procurement organizations, 
agricultural enterprises sold through these channels over the 
elapsed period of the year 21 percent of cattle and poultry, 5.8 
percent of milk, and 8.4 percent of eggs (last year, 
respectively, 13 percent, 3 percent, and 8 percent). 
<H5>  Income of the Population </H5>
  The monetary income of the population over January-April of 
this year amounted to R78 trillion and was 8.5 times greater 
than in the corresponding period of 1993. 
  The population's disposable income (income less compulsory 
payments) increased by about 12 percent after factoring in the 
consumer price index. 
  The distribution of the Russian Federation population by 
size 
of per capita income in 1994 is characterized by the following

  In April 1993, 26 percent of the population had a per capita 
income of up to R10,000 a month, 40 percent--between R10,000 and 
R20,000 a month, 27 percent--between R20,000 and R40,000, and 7 
percent--more than R40,000. 
  The coefficient of income concentration (the Gini index) 
measured 0.311 in April 1994 (0.353 in April 1993).

  The change in the value of the subsistence minimum of 
the Russian Federation population in 1994 (determined in 
accordance with the methodology of the Russian Ministry of 
Labor) is shown in the following table:

  The income of 11 percent of the population (16 million 
persons) in April 1994 was below the sustenance minimum value; 
of these, the income of 3 percent of the population was below 
the value of the consumer food basket, which in the calculation 
of the subsistence minimum amounted to R45,400. 
  The estimated average wages earned by workers in 
April of this year in Russia as a whole amounted to R175,000--a 
6 percent increase as compared to March of this year and a 
1.3-fold increase as compared to January. 
<H5>  Employment </H5>
  The total number of unemployed in the Russian Federation at 
the end of April comprised 4.5 million persons, or 6 percent of 
total economically active population. Of them, about 1.2 million 
persons were officially designated as unemployed by state 
employment service organs (1.5 percent of the economically 
active population). In addition, the number of persons forced to 
work a shortened work week or take administrative leave without 
pay or with partial pay comprised an estimated 4.5 million. 
  Thus, in April of this year the total unemployment potential 
amounted to 9.0 million persons (8.8 million persons in March of 
this year). 
<H5>  Natural Demographic Trends </H5>
  In the first quarter of 1994 the indicators of natural 
changes in the population of the Russian Federation were as 
follows: 


                January-March 1994,   Per 1,000 population 
                thousand persons 

                                      January-March 

                                      1992          1993          1994 

Births          349.9                 11.4          9.6           9.6 

Deaths          591.6                 12.1          14.4          16.2 

Natural loss    241.7                 0.7           4.8           6.6 


  After six years (1988-1993) of intensive decline in the 
birth 
rate in the country there are currently some signs of 
stabilization: The total birth rate indicator for January-March 
1994 remained at the level of the first quarter of 1993--9.6 
births per 1,000 of the population. Also, in March, for the 
first time since 1987, there was a small (2,500, or 2 percent) 
increase in the number of births as compared to the same month 
of the preceding year. Overall over the first quarter a small 
increase in the birth rate was registered in 33 territories of 
Russia; at the same time, in 43 regions it continued to decline. 
The greatest decline in the birth rate--by 10-7 percent--was 
registered in the Republics of Mari El and Karelia, Yevreyskaya 
Autonomous Oblast, Ivanovo, Pskov, Arkhangelsk, and Bryansk 
Oblasts. The birth rate remains extremely low in St. Petersburg, 
Moscow, and Leningrad and Moscow Oblasts, where it does not 
exceed seven births per 1,000 inhabitants. 
  The improvement in the situation with respect to population 
reproduction is offset by the increased death rate. The number 
of deaths in January-March 1994 as compared to the corresponding 
period of 1993 increased by 63,100, and the total mortality 
indicator rose to 16.2 deaths per 1,000 population, or by 12 
percent. An especially considerable increase in the death rate 
was registered in the Republic of Mordvinia--by 28 percent, 
Novosibirsk Oblast--by 25 percent, Perm Oblast--by 23 percent, 
Pskov Oblast--by 21 percent, Kostroma, Moscow, and Tver 
Oblasts--by 20 percent, Sverdlovsk and Chita Oblast and the 
Republic of Udmurtia--by 19 percent. 
  Similar to last year, the greatest increase in the mortality 
rate--by 20 percent--was registered with respect to accidental 
poisoning by alcohol; mortality caused by contagious and 
parasite-born diseases--by 18 percent; and that from circulatory 
system diseases--by 15 percent. 
  Because of higher mortality, natural population loss 
increased over the first quarter of this year by 66,200, or 38 
percent. In the overwhelming majority of Russia's regions the 
number of deaths now exceeds the number of births--in 24 
territories by a factor of two or three. 
<H5>  Cargo Deliveries by Waterways to Regions of the Far North </H5>
  As of 1 May of this year, 1.8 times less cargo was shipped 
by 
sea to regions of the Far North than of the same date last year.

  The most significant reductions as compared to last year in 
the volume of cargo deliveries by sea were to the following 
ports: Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by 59 percent), Magadan (by 57 
percent), Dudinka (by 16 percent), and Sakhalin (by 31 percent). 
There was less liquid cargo than last year delivered to the 
ports of Sakhalin (by 62 percent), to Magadan (by 60 percent), 
and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy (by 47 percent). 
  As of 1 May of this year, 6,000 tonnes of products and goods 
waiting to be shipped by coastal transport (34 percent of 1 May 
1993 level) accumulated in the port of Vladivostok, through 
which goods are shipped to the Far North to points of year-round 
navigation, and 9,000 tonnes (55 percent) in the port of Vanino. 
  As compared to 1 April of this year, remainders of cargo 
waiting to be shipped by coastal transport to the Far North at 
the main sea ports increased by 24 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tatarnikov, assistant to the Russian </F>
Federation president's representative in Irkutsk Oblast: ""Do 
Not Touch Our Gold!"] 
  [Text] It was said a long time ago that the most 
exciting stories in the golden storehouse of world literature 
deal with gold--the infamous yellow metal. However, it would be 
a mistake to think that they are all inherited from the 
past--the time of the conquistadors, "gold fever," or pirates on 
the high seas. This is one of the stories set in modern times 
which has a plot suitable for an adventure novel. 
  Irkutsk Oblast holds one of the leading positions among the 
regions engaged in gold mining. Most of the gold in the oblast 
is extracted in the North--in Bodaybinskiy Rayon, where the 
closed-type joint-stock company "Lenzoloto" is located. Until 
recently it was a state enterprise--a production association 
with the same name. It would probably still be one today if the 
pace of privatization had not been stepped up. 
  On 9 April 1992, Yegor Gaydar, who was the first deputy 
chairman of the Russian Federation Government at that time, 
decided that the time had come for the "Lenzoloto" PO 
[Production Association] to join the triumphal procession of 
privatization. On this day the vice premier signed Directive No. 
693-r, which ordered that: "The Lena gold mining production 
association 'Lenzoloto,' a state enterprise, is to be 
transformed into a closed-type joint-stock company. The 
'Lenzoloto' Joint-Stock Company is authorized to enlist foreign 
investors to finance production development, under the condition 
that the amount contributed to the joint-stock company's charter 
fund by foreign investors does not exceed 31 percent." 
  However, a minor violation of the law slipped into the 
government decree, either because of carelessness by the 
officials who prepared it or an oversight by the vice premier 
himself. 
  From a letter sent by the Russian Federation procurator 
general to the chairman of the Russian Federation Government, 
V.S. Chernomyrdin, on 6 September 1993: 
  "The directive from Ye.T. Gaydar conflicts with the 
Basic Provisions of the Program for Privatization of State and 
Municipal Enterprises in 1992, in effect at the time of its 
issuance, which authorized their transformation only into 
open-type joint-stock companies in the process of their 
privatization." 
  At first glance, the violation does not seem so terrible. 
However, subsequent events once again confirmed the words of the 
classic--that the slightest violation of the law is a hole which 
the bourgeoisie will inevitably rush through. 
  On 28 August 1992, Petr Mostovoy, the first deputy chairman 
of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on the Administration 
of State Property], issued his own directive to execute this 
Russian Federation Government directive--under the number 392-r: 
"The Lena Gold Mining Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company 
`Lenzoloto' is to be established with the participation of a 
foreign investor--the 'Star Technology Systems Limited' 
corporation--and the Lena Gold Mining Production Association 
`Lenzoloto' is to be abolished." 
  Petr Mostovoy's directive raised a number of puzzling 
questions in the organs of state authority of Irkutsk Oblast: 
Why did one of the largest enterprises in the oblast's North 
have to be abolished and why was the foreign "Star" Corporation, 
which was given the honor of becoming a founder of one of the 
largest gold mining enterprises, glorified in this way? 
  There were even more questions when the founding documents 
of 
the new joint-stock company arrived in the oblast in October 
1992. 
  Its founders--the Russian Federation Goskomimushchestvo and 
the "Star" Corporation, registered in Hong Kong under laws of 
the British Virgin Islands--set the objective of developing 
placer gold deposits, and most importantly, the "Sukhoy Log" 
Gold Deposits, the largest in Russia. At the same time, the 
"Star" Corporation made the commitment to put 250 million U.S. 
dollars into the charter fund: $125 million of this sum were to 
be entered in the first year after registration (which took 
place in September 1992) and the remaining $125 million were to 
be added over a 3-year period. 
  From the report signed by "Star" President (I. Makni) 
and "Star" Director (L. Mor): 
  "`Star Technology Systems, Limited,' British Virgin 
Islands (because of its favorable taxes): 
  "Capital: 1 million U.S. dollars. 
  "Financing of projects in Russia from 1990 to 1992: 7 
million U.S. dollars." 
  And here is another document. 
  From a statement signed by Academician Boris Laskorin 
of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]: 
  "Taking into account that advanced technologies have 
been developed in Russia to extract gold from ore and technical 
and economic feasibility has been established for a mining 
complex on the basis of the `Sukhoy Log' Deposits, we believe 
that there is no need to enlist any foreign firms for the 
`Sukhoy Log' Deposits. 
  The Goskomimushchestvo, it would seem, has one significant 
argument in this regard--Russia does not have the money to 
develop such a project, but "Star" is providing no less than 
$250 million. 
  But this is only at first glance. The fact is that the 
"Star" 
firm is realy not such a kind "transatlantic rich uncle." 
  Initially, "Star" made the commitment to invest 250 million 
U.S. dollars in the operation, but a year had not gone by when 
Petr Mostovoy and "Star" President (I. Makni) signed a protocol 
changing the founding agreement: 
  "`Star' is taking part in the formation of founding 
capital by transferring funds in foreign currency evaluated at 
625 million rubles [R]. Within 12 months from the date of the 
company's registration, `Star' will pay no less than 50 percent 
of its share in the founding capital in the amount of R312.5 
million in foreign currency at the Central Bank exchange rate in 
effect on the date of the company's registration." 
  The question arises: why was there any need to make a fuss 
by 
enlisting a foreign investor for the sake of such conditions? 
Especially as the founding capital for the "Lenzoloto" AO 
[Joint-Stock Company] has not been organized, although a year 
and a half has gone by since the enterprise was registered. 
  From a letter sent on 4 November 1993 by the Russian 
Ministry of Security: 
  "The Russian Ministry of Security has repeatedly 
informed the Russian Federation Government about this matter and 
expressed its opinion on the inadvisability of enlisting the 
`Star Technology Systems' firm as a founder of the `Lenzoloto' 
AO under conditions of the founding agreement, which are harmful 
to Russia's interests and grant the joint-stock company the 
right to monopoly development of the `Sukhoy Log' Gold 
Deposits." 
  And what is most astonishing is that those who initiated the 
plan to develop "Sukhoy Log" did not even get around to 
coordinating the project with the oblast authorities and the 
Bodaybinskiy Rayon administration, on whose territory the 
natural resources which attracted the attention of the "Star" 
firm are located. 
  The collective of the "Lenzoloto" Production Association was 
bypassed as well. 
  From a letter sent by the procurator general of the 
Russian Federation on 6 September 1993: 
  "In accordance with the privatization plan approved by 
the Goskomimushchestvo, 21.15 percent of the stock, only 6.9 
percent of which is common (voting) stock, is transferred to 
members of the labor collective, while the foreign `Star' 
company receives 31 percent... 
  "Taking into account what has been stated, I ask you, 
Viktor Stepanovich, to take steps to eliminate the violations 
committed when the `Lenzoloto' Production Association was 
changed into the `Lenzoloto' Closed-Type Joint-Stock Company and 
to bring the formal documents of the government and the 
Goskomimushchestvo into conformity with the laws in effect." 
  In addition to the Office of the Procurator General, the 
following concluded that the directives of the 
Goskomimushchestvo were not in conformity with Russian 
Federation laws: the State-Legal Administration of the Russian 
Federation President, the Ministry of Justice, the Management 
Administration of the Russian Federation President, the 
Roskomnedra [State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral 
Resources], the Roskomdragmet [Committee on Precious Metals and 
Precious Stones], the Ministry of Economics, and a number of 
federal departments. But things are not moving, as they say. 
  In October 1992, the Irkutsk Oblast Soviet held up 
implementation of the Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents in 
the oblast's territory, and then appealed to the Russian 
Federation Supreme Court for their repeal. 
  Unfortunately, however, consideration of the case was 
delayed. One of the reasons for the delay was the endless 
promises by the Goskomimushchestvo that the government was about 
to make a decision to resolve all the problems. 
  A year and a half passed after the oblast appealed to the 
court. 
  From a letter sent by V. Ilyukhin, chairman of the 
Committee on Security of the State Duma, to V. Lebedev, chairman 
of the Supreme Court, on 30 March 1994: 
  "The violations of law permitted by the Russian 
Federation Goskomimushchestvo are threatening the interests of 
the Russian Federation's economic security. 
  "A number of proposals have been prepared to eliminate 
the violations revealed. However, the fact that the case 
indicated still has not been considered is impeding their 
implementation to a certain extent. 
  "We would be grateful for your assistance in speeding 
up resolution of this case." 
  It is appropriate in this connection to point out that as 
long ago as 29 June 1993, the oblast administration, the Irkutsk 
Oblast Soviet, and the Russian Federation President's 
representative in Irkutsk Oblast, together with the 
Roskomdragmet, the Ministry of Atomic Energy, and the 
Roskomnedra, submitted a draft directive to the Russian 
Federation Government which provides for the repeal of the 
Goskomimushchestvo's illegal documents and brings Y. Gaydar's 
directive of 9 April 1992 and the mechanism for financing 
development of "Sukhoy Log" into conformity with the law. 
  Elections to the local self-government organs in Irkutsk 
Oblast were held on 27 March 1993. The newly elected head of 
administration of the city of Bodaybo. N. Sizykh, petitioned the 
court for the Bodaybo administration to take part in the case as 
an independent party. The court approved this petition. The next 
court session is set for 6 July 1994--enough time for the 
Russian Federation Government to heed the opinion expressed by 
the Office of the Procurator General and ministries and 
departments and put an end to this drawn-out story.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Shafranik, Russian minister of fuel and </F>
energy, prepared for publication by Sergey Panasenko: "We Know 
Exactly What Direction the Reforms Are Taking"] 
  [Text] Russian Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuriy 
Shafranik was the most recent guest of the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 
editorial staff. The manager of the leading sector (if not the 
key one) of the Russian economy set forth his views on how the 
country's fuel and energy complex has to be developed and 
responded to journalists' questions. Today we are offering our 
readers an account of this conversation. 
  PRICES. "...Everyone is talking about world prices 
today. They have set the task: come up to world prices. We have 
already come up to them, even exceeding them, for many 
commodities. But at that time, around 1990, it would have been 
correct to think not about an increase in prices as such, but 
their relationships. There is a price for a metric ton of oil, 
or grain, or gold--and everything else 'related' to them. After 
all, this is the way it is all over the world, and this 
proportion is practically identical everywhere. And this 
correlation ought to be scheduled by directive for a five-year 
period so that every economic manager knows: his energy costs 
this much now, and in a month it will cost that much, so that he 
can be prepared... 
  "But what has happened today? There are free, world prices 
for the final products, but there are no free prices at all in 
the TEK [fuel and energy complex]. Everything is being 
regulated. Some prices are regulated strictly, and others not as 
strictly--petroleum is regulated least strictly--but everything 
is being regulated. As a result, in developed foreign countries, 
energy expenditures account for up to 35 percent of the price of 
a commodity, but here they account for up to 15 percent of the 
cost. It is cheap, and hence it is wasteful. We do not have any 
commodity that is in a position to compete with Western 
commodities with respect to the energy consumed in its 
manufacture. Ammonia requires 400 kilowatt-hours to produce 1 
metric ton. In other parts of the world, no more than 80 
kilowatt-hours are needed. And this is the way it is with 
everything: metal, machinery; sometimes the gap is not this 
ridiculous, but one always exists. This is where it is 
apparent--in the profitability of our industrial exports! 
  "And it is not enough that they are still not paying us! You 
know that the rate for electric power varies by territory in 
Russia. Here you have Krasnoyarsk Kray and Irkutsk Oblast, where 
it is the lowest. And nearby the Kuzbass, where it is more 
expensive. So where do you think the percentage of nonpayment is 
higher? Where it is less expensive! And many have not been 
paying simply because they did not want to, not because they 
were unable to pay. It has been to their advantage--50 percent 
of all Russia's nonpayments are 'sitting' in the fuel and energy 
complex! The sector has 5 million mployees and half of the 
nonpayments. And we have been unable to do any more about this 
lately. Thanks to the government, there is now a decree on 
responsibility for nonpayment for fuel and energy resources. 
Strict measures have been stipulated there. We have been 
authorized a great deal: to exclude all facilities except the 
military and those of the highest categories. 
  "Naturally, the zero hour will come, when either there will 
simply be no oil and gas because the prices have been frozen and 
nothing is left for renovation or reproduction--and oil and gas 
are the most capital-intensive production facilities in the 
world, or else we will have to 'release' all the prices at the 
same time..." 
  THE RUSSIAN FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES. "...Last year we increased the sale of our 
output in other countries by 13 percent and we restored the 
markets we had lost. Not all of them, but some of them. We 
increased the foreign commodity turnover of the TEK's outputby 
23 percent, but the prices dropped, and the increase was only 19 
percent in real income for this reason. 
  "The debtors are a sore point here, of course. Take Ukraine 
for example. How many disputes there have been: whether to pump 
or not to pump. It is simple to look like a patriot: if 
Shafranik stops pumping, he is a hero. This often happens here 
for some reason: you are a winner if you don't work. If you do 
not pump, you can tell everyone you are a patriot. We will not 
give them oil until they pay! But in the meantime, over the past 
3 months Ukraine bought 2 million metric tons of petroleum 
products in Rotterdam--and it even paid a little less than we 
were asking, incidentally. 
  "If I had been the president of a private company here, I 
would tell you exactly: friends, do what you want, but I will 
ship out half of it on credit for 2 years. This is what they do 
throughout the world. Because the worst thing is to lose a 
market that you already hold. This is a crime for both a company 
and a state! And we are walking on a knife's edge here. But 
Ukraine's debt for oil has not increased since September 1993, 
by the way. And it is better for us to index these debts and to 
settle them as we please. The state will help in the final 
analysis. 
  "They are forgiving, deferring, and recalculating our 
foreign 
debts--aren't you indignant? Because this is all normal. 
  "For some reason, behind all these cries about debts no one 
has noticed that Ukraine's nonpayments are much less than 
Russia's. Yes, we have now made large concessions to them on 
gas. But after all, we drove these prices up to the European 
level by decrees in the 1992-1993 period, that is, we did what 
we had to do for Russia. This was a tremendous success, and it 
must not be underestimated. We brought settlements with our 
neighbors up to the world level on the job without the hue and 
cry. So should we spoil all this now? 
  "Incidentally, we went even further--we are receiving 
property to settle the debts. Ukraine is transferring to us a 
controlling block of stock in the Lisichansk complex; it 
includes three plants, the best NPZ [petroleum refineries] in 
the former Soviet Union, and our product is showing up right 
away in Rostov and farther away--in Stavropol and Krasnodar. 
Certainly, refine the oil and rush it to the ports: it is pure 
profit. And we are planning a new refinery today, valued at 1 
billion..." 
  THE RUSSIAN FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND WESTERN 
CAPITAL. "...There is a great deal of talk to the effect 
that we are not allowing Western oil companies here. But why 
should we receive them with open arms? We are taking positions 
in the struggle in other countries, and only in the most 
difficult places, where it is very hard to extract the oil. The 
world has been divided. And when we established the first three 
independent companies, they ran into the 20 world giants right 
away; naturally, even though you are dealing in a friendship, 
the law of the market is the law of the market: it is clear they 
do not have a burning desire to allow competitors here. And I 
have told Western representatives many times: 'Colleagues, do 
you think everything should be simple here, without a struggle? 
Are you struggling at home? Yes. So struggle here!' 
  "What is associated with this is another matter. Are there 
positive examples of new investments? There are. Are we 
gradually improving the laws? We are. Do not look at a case, but 
the trend. Is the trend as a whole a positive one? 
  "They agree: it is a positive one. I am not talking about 
political stability and everything like this--they have their 
own problems there. I am talking about economics. 
  "Generally speaking, we should not divide the investment 
process into Western and non-Western. It should be approached as 
a process. If there is an easy conversion, what difference does 
it make who is investing what and what he wants to receive? The 
truth lies in something else. With the current taxes, it will 
soon be simply unprofitable for either us or the foreigners to 
extract petroleum in Russia. Our enterprises and Western 
enterprises are in the same boat here. 
  "Is there a danger in taking 'Western' money in this field 
in 
the sense of loss of control? Well, generally speaking, I am for 
the risk, for the danger. I believe in myself. Everything must 
be done simply by using one's head. If they installed something, 
or sold something, but left control... But you understand that 
while we are discussing the danger, production is declining and 
work positions are being cut back. This is where the real danger 
is. But 70 percent of all orders for the Sakhalin project stay 
in Russia. And for 70 percent of all these billions from the 
West--the orders and work places remain here. What else can we 
speak about here, and what nuances can we argue about?.." 
  THE FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND THE STATE. 
"...Russia has the most efficient power engineering in the 
world. Russia has the best ecological indicators for discharges 
per kilowatt of energy. The largest yield of capacity per 
kilowatt... In general, this is one of the few sectors that 
operate efficiently today. We worked through the winter 
efficiently, practically without interruption. But we were paid 
30 percent of what was owed over the past 6 months. If this is 
operating in accordance with the market, a great many people 
should have suffered... 
  "So the consumers are not paying. What is happening to the 
investments? Our share in incomes for the state budget is under 
50 percent, if everything is taken into account. And 6 percent 
of the expenditures. This is with all the subsidies, including 
for coal. Last year we received the ridiculous amount of 3 
percent of the overall sum in credits. The result: the rate of 
decline in all investments from all sources averaged 16 percent 
for Russia as a whole and 28 percent for the fuel and energy 
complex. This is for the most capital-intensive sector, where 
there are simply no projects with a cost recovery period of less 
than seven years! 
  "They are not allowing us to earn, either. The tax component 
is more than half of the price of gas, more than 60 percent of 
the price of oil, and over 75 percent of the price of petroleum 
products. And these are only the direct taxes. But when you go 
somewhere in 'Komineft' and start to familiarize yourself with 
local affairs, it turns out that 83 percent of the price goes 
for taxes there. 
  "Meanwhile, we should take advantage of the fact that there 
is a recession in industry and the demand for energy has also 
declined, although compared with the overall recession, it has 
not declined much. We should not worry about this--on the 
contrary, we should actively invest in developing surplus energy 
capacities now. Throughout the world, they are holding the 
reserve of capacities at a minimum of 20 to 25 percent, but we 
had about 3 to 5 percent in 1990. But what kind of a market is 
it without a surplus? Moreover, this is the most powerful 
anti-inflationary factor, for where there is a surplus under 
free prices, they go down, not up. But in order to at least 
record a free surplus of the capacities, this reserve, 
investments are needed. 
  "Do you know that in principle it is not profitable to trade 
in petroleum products in Russia? So now they are making a fuss: 
someone has taken crude oil to Rotterdam, but our refineries are 
standing idle... Yes they have taken it there. Yes, they are 
standing idle. And they will continue to remain idle as long as 
the excise and other taxes are such that it is more 
profitable--more profitable, you understand!--to ship crude oil 
to Rotterdam and refine it there. 
  "And I do not separate myself from the government in this 
case. We succeed in accomplishing some things, we do not succeed 
in others. But we have recently prepared about 40 documents, 
basic ones for us, and 10 decrees have been issued already. We 
are refining and polishing them. I should say that our sector 
has now been provided with a program, and we have an accurate 
conception of what we will be doing and how to implement the 
reform. Many draft laws have already gone through the 
government, and others are still there. The Law on Oil and Gas, 
amendments to the Law on Mineral Resources, the Law on Energy 
Conservation--these the government has already passed. The 
Decree on 'Production Sharing', that is, the rules for dividing 
output that is produced, has been confirmed by an edict and will 
be approved by parliament. We have prepared six laws on our 
energy strategy. Even more of these laws are needed, and we will 
prepare them, send them through every conceivable and 
inconceivable expert, then conduct them through the parliament. 
  "We have worked out our own approach. Briefly, this is what 
it is. To maintain as many capacities as possible, to mobilize 
the collectives, to implement shareholding, to consolidate and 
build up everything vertically, completing it to the end 
product--we will bring our companies out right at the gasoline 
pump, without middlemen. This year there will be 10 of these 
companies, not four as there are now. Naturally, we have to find 
money and invest it in resources, in a resource base. And by 
fair means or foul, we have to go beyond Russia's borders--to 
Vietnam and Nigeria, and to extract it there. We have an 
agreement with Azerbaijan on the Caspian shelf, and this is the 
richest one. One more extremely important project is the 
pipeline consortium from Tengiz to the Black Sea. So the 
approaches, I reiterate, are completely clear..." 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  We have incredibly inexpensive energy, and where it is 
cheap, it is wasteful. We do not have any commodity that is in a 
position to compete with Western commodities with respect to the 
energy consumed in its manufacture. 
  We are prepared to pump half the oil abroad on credit, 
if necessary. Because the worst thing is to lose a market that 
you already hold. This is a crime for both a company and a 
state 
  With the current taxes, it will soon be unprofitable 
for either us or the foreigners to extract petroleum in Russia. 
Production is declining and work positions are being cut back. 
This is where the real danger is. 
  We will bring our companies out right at the gasoline 
pump, bypassing the middlemen. Today we have a clear conception 
of what must be done and what we will be doing.

<F P=106> [Report on Russian Minister of Transportation V. Yefimov's </F>
press conference by Yu. Vereshchagin: "Problems of the 
Transportation Complex"] 
  [Text] Russian Minister of Transportation V. Yefimov 
held a press conference in Government House on the subject 
"Transport: the People, the Work, and the Problems," in which he 
provided details on the current situation in the country's 
transportation and highway complex. 
  In the minister's words, Russia's transportation system is 
entering the market with more and more confidence day after day. 
Many enterprises have been converted to share holding and 
privatized. The state sector (including the Ministry of 
Railways) accounts for 37 percent of the transportation complex 
today. 
  Following the economic recession in 1991 and 1992, it began 
a 
slow recovery. Currency receipts from this sector of the economy 
are increasing. Air transport, as an example, provided 40 
percent more foreign exchange for the treasury than in the 
preceding year; river transport increased its currency 
contribution by 25 percent, and the throughput capacity of river 
ports was increased by 1.5 times as much... 
  Now, V. Yefimov said, under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Transportation, a program is being developed to prevent idle 
time in Russia's transportation production line and establish 
inspection systems. Licensing of the right to operate all means 
of transportation in the complex is being vigorously introduced. 
  Beginning on 1 July, the ministry is starting a new 
activity--certification of personnel involved in transportation 
safety. This means that a specialist who is certificated will be 
able to prove his right to inspect means of transportation. 
  Then V. Yefimov dwelled on the features of the different 
transportation sectors. Despite the economic difficulties, a 
gradual updating of the technical equipment, as well as the 
enterprises and complexes, is taking place gradually in the 
maritime and river fleets, in the airlines, in facilities for 
motor vehicle drivers, and in the Federal Highway Service. 
  Aviation enterprises, for example, acquired 54 new 
current-generation aircraft last year: the Il-96, Tu-204, 
An-124, and other aircraft. Federal programs are being worked 
out in civil aviation subunits today to improve the unified 
system for air traffic organization and aviation safety. A state 
program is being established to develop civil aviation up to the 
year 2000. Last year, 17 new air routes were opened. 
  The situation in maritime transport continues to be 
complicated because of changes in the transportation market for 
services and nonpayments. The number of obsolete vessels written 
off in 1993 (59) exceeded the number added (15). Nevertheless, 
the Russian fleet continues to stand its difficult watch. 
Overall profit from its activity last year amounted to 600 
billion rubles [R]. 
  For the first time this year, Russia's shipping companies 
ordered about 80 vessels, most of which will be built in 
domestic shipyards, with their own funds and the funds of 
Russian and foreign investors. Construction and renovation of 
several major ports are under way. Russia should continue to be 
a great sea power, the minister said. 
  As V. Yefimov noted, preparation of the river fleet and 
ports 
for the current navigation season has been conducted under 
difficult financial conditions. Russia's river transportation 
facilities include about 100,000 kilometers of shipping 
channels, 4,700 shipping companies and ship owners, 120 river 
ports, and over 100 ship repair yards. The process of changing 
enterprises to share holding is being completed in this sector 
now. A little over 25 percent of the stock remains with the 
state in this case. 
  But the chief concern, in the minister's opinion, is the 
fact 
that shipping and the ports have turned out to be in an 
extremely critical financial situation without payment in 
advance, inasmuch as many clients still have not settled 
accounts for the work performed last year. As a result, the 
river transportation workers do not have anything to pay for 
ship fuel and electricity, and, finally, to pay their 
specialists' wages. A paradoxical situation is taking shape: the 
fleet is prepared to work and shippers have the commodities and 
the need to ship them by water routes, but the consumer does not 
have the funds to pay for the products and the transportation 
tariffs. 
  The river transportation workers who supply regions in the 
far north are in an even worse situation. Practically no cargo 
has accumulated yet at the transshipment ports, and petroleum 
products are not being purchased, although they are available in 
sufficient amounts at the petroleum bulk plants for 
transshipment. 
  In addition, there are numerous problems in keeping the 
locks, canals, and other water route facilities in working order. 
  About 100 million passengers are transported every day by 
motor vehicle and suburban electrical transportation service. 
They account for 87 percent of the passenger service provided by 
all modes of transportation. 
  In most regions, V. Yefimov noted, the problems of subsidies 
for unprofitable passenger vehicle enterprises still have not 
been resolved. The Department of Automotive Transport has worked 
out a special program to get out of this difficult situation. In 
particular, it provides for a system of steady financial support 
for suburban passenger transport services, production 
organization, and the purchase of rolling stock and spare parts. 
  The program stipulates that about 3,000 buses be 
manufactured 
at the sector's enterprises and that new capacities be 
established to turn out trolley buses in Bryansk and streetcars 
in Yekaterinburg. It takes into account the standards regulating 
passenger services in large cities and the countryside. 
  Thanks to a special system for financing and managing the 
country's roads in the economic crisis, the Federal Road 
Department managed to save the country's dilapidated road 
network from destruction in 1993, to put a stop to the 
disintegration of repair enterprises, and to retain their 
personnel. 
  In the minister's words, the process of bringing the highway 
network up to date has begun, the Ministry of Transportation has 
begun to implement a road traffic safety program, and 
general-use roads, which had no financing in the recent past, 
are being included in the republic network... 
  Over the past 2 years, the length of the highway network has 
increased by 40,000 kilometers. Main routes such the ones 
between Moscow and Voronezh, Omsk and Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk 
and Irkutsk, and Chita and Khabarovsk are being renovated. 
Several large bridges are being built. In a word, Russia is 
crawling out of the quagmire of impassable roads little by 
little. And, as a whole, the transportation and highway 
complex--the TDK--is moving out of a state of confusion and 
apathy. A great deal of work lies ahead.

<F P=106> [Interview with V. Sazonov, chief of the Ministry of </F>
Railways Lines Main Administration, by GUDOK correspondent V. 
Gitkovich; place and date not given: "Reduce Expenses, Not by 
Decreasing Volume"] 
  [Text] Maintenance workers have already gone out on 
their lines. They have three main objectives now: to increase 
the volume of repair, to improve its quality, and to reduce 
expenses. At first glance, it is hard to coordinate these 
desires with each other. But obviously they can be coordinated, 
and most importantly, they must be! But how is this to be 
accomplished? Our correspondent discusses this with V. Sazonov, 
chief of the Lines Main Administration. 
  [Gitkovich] Vladimir Nikolayevich, 6,808 kilometers must 
undergo major repair this year. If the railroads' current 
shortage of funds to acquire the needed quantity of materials is 
taken into account, it will be a very hard job. 
  [Sazonov] This may sound paradoxical, but we plan to 
increase 
the area for repair by reducing expenses for it. The point is 
that the railroads will be making the maximum use possible of 
resource conservation technologies. We are putting many rails, 
ties, tie plates, and other materials into use for the second 
time. 
  This was also done previously, but not in such volume, and 
it 
did not have as much effect on the production cost of operations 
as we expect now for this reason. After all, this year we are 
counting on reinstallation of 4.382 million wooden ties and 
70,000 metric tons of tie plates and the reuse of 8,500 spikes. 
  I will not list everything else. I will add only that the 
old 
track grids are being repaired intensively with reinforced 
concrete ties at unit assembly bases of the PMS [track machinery 
service]. This year we plan to make use of 1,126 kilometers of 
selected grid work. It will be installed on the main routes with 
overall freight traffic of up to 25 million ton-kilometers. If 
we succeed in carrying out all the measures, this year we will 
save 57 billion rubles (in December 1993 prices). 
  [Gitkovich] Everything you mentioned involves major repair. 
And, although new rails are used in this, as a rule, there is 
quite a lot of concern about them as well. 
  [Sazonov] I have not forgotten about the rails or the 
switches. I was simply saving them up "for later." After all, 
they should provide the most economy for us. Clearly, we will be 
welding them in long lengths. But at the same time, we will be 
making more and more extensive use of rails that have already 
completed their service life on sections with heavy traffic. 
Without cutting them, we will install them on lines with less 
freight traffic. 
  But this will not leave our rail-welding trains without 
work. 
They will have to significantly increase the volume of 
hard-facing on the defective rail ends directly on the track (up 
to 5,000 units this year) and renovation by electric-arc welding 
of the frogs (over 28,500 units this year). 
  Everything mentioned not only will provide for substantial 
economy, it will enable us to repair more, but, if we add to 
this the many kilometers of sections without a single joint from 
station to station that have already appeared on the Kuybyshev, 
Gorkiy, and other mainlines, as well as the careful polishing of 
the rails, we will have a line that is really "like velvet." 
  [Gitkovich] All this is fine. But they say that we are 
substantially behind the most technically developed countries in 
our technology for major repair, and that those countries have 
distinctive combines that perform the entire complex of 
operations needed for major repair in one pass. 
  [Sazonov] You see, the main reason for the different 
technologies in major repair here and in the West is the 
fundamentally different requirements for them. There, where the 
freight traffic is relatively insignificant and the network of 
rail lines is more dense, they can shut down a certain section 
for a week, or even three, to perform major repair. In past 
years, when transport service was increased rapidly and at times 
exceeded the throughput capacity of the lines, we counted every 
hour of interruption in the traffic. And under these conditions, 
productivity during a "window" hour and the opportunity to work 
on a double-track section without interrupting traffic on both 
sides for one of the tracks were most important of all for us. 
  I believe that under these conditions our technology coped 
with its basic task. Perhaps the most vulnerable aspect of it 
was cleaning the ballast. We worked only with the upper layer, 
and, for that reason, whether we liked it or not, we were forced 
to add a substantial amount of fresh ballast, raising our tracks 
even higher, or to move the "extra" ballast with bulldozers to 
the slopes and into the ditches; in addition to the economic 
losses, this also damaged the roadbed. 
  Incidentally, in the West, ballast cleaning is not as 
critical because the rolling stock there is in much better 
condition and they package much of what we ship in bulk. 
  But life has changed now, and we have the chance to shut 
down 
entire sections of the lines for a significant period of time. I 
think that this, combined with the new ballast cleaning machines 
that not only cover a thicker layer of it, but make it possible 
to return the ballast to the track after cleaning, will make 
major repair more efficient. 
  In addition, under these conditions, we can also devote our 
attention to treatment of the main roadbed, which plays a 
decisive role in improvement of the line. 
  The first "windows" over many days are already under way on 
the October Railroad. We are checking there to see if it is 
necessary to spend billions right away on new machinery or 
whether we can manage with what is available and achieve good 
results. 
  [Gitkovich] "Windows" for many days--this is one more result 
of the continuing decline in the volume of freight service. And 
the pace of this process is very rapid (22.4 percent in the 
first quarter of this year, instead of the 4.8 percent that was 
predicted). And in order to be profitable, the railroads are 
rushing to bring operating expenses into conformity with the 
decrease in transport service. And this is one of the simplest 
measures, at first glance--reduction of the work force. How do 
you view this? 
  [Sazonov] Unfavorably. And this is why. For the present they 
are not cutting back on line maintenance personnel, but the 
personnel departments of many subdivisions are already posting 
lists showing that hiring for work is being discontinued. And 
this is essentially the same thing. The point is that the 
turnover in our subunits is roughly equivalent to 50 percent 
annually. And by discontinuing the hiring of new workers to 
replace those who have left, we may be short of one-quarter of 
the line repairmen that we had in just six months. But after 
all, the average personnel strength for the system at the 
beginning of the year was a little over 70 percent of what is 
authorized--and even less on individual railroads. 
  It is hard to visualize how the brigades will look soon on 
the East Siberian, October, or Kemerovo railroads, where the 
turnover last year was 68, 70, and 81.8 percent, respectively. 
But after all, Russia's railroads are poorly equipped with track 
machinery at present, and manual and labor-intensive operations, 
especially for current track maintenance, are adequate for this 
reason. This is one of the important reasons for the turnover, 
by the way. 
  Recently many highly skilled employees from a defense plant 
came to one of the subdivisions where a reduction in force was 
under way. But they did not have time to rejoice in the 
subdivision, since nearly all the new arrivals were dismissed. 
The people were unaccustomed to hard work outside in any kind of 
weather, and at times even at any time of day. 
  With the extent of mechanization and the volume of repair 
work we have today, each line maintenance brigade should be at 
least 75 percent of its authorized strength. Only under such 
conditions can we provide for reliable track use. 
  There is no question that authorized personnel strength 
should also be adjusted for the decline in transport service. 
These standards were worked out recently in the Ministry of 
Railways and sent to the railroads. I also want to point out 
that reducing the number of track maintenance workers is not the 
most efficient method of lowering operating expenses in our 
administration, where wages account for 32 percent of overall 
expenses. 
  The introduction of resource conservation technologies is 
much more productive. Including those that provide for extension 
of the service life of materials by maintaining the track in 
good condition, where the track maintenance employees play an 
important role. 
  A small example. Today the cost of one new rail is nearly a 
quarterly wage for a track maintenance worker. In sections with 
an excellent record, such a rail serves 1.5 to two times longer. 
It is not hard to determine what is more advantageous for a 
railroad and in which direction they need to proceed.

<F P=106> [Article: "Socialist Demonstration Is a Useless Activity"] </F>
  [Text] Mr. Melikyan, minister of Labor, has come forth with 
an initiative for a radical change in personal income tax. 
  There are two approaches to an active income policy: 
economically rich in content and politically demagogic. The 
first path presupposes a rigid policy on income and a strictly 
time-limited phase of financial stabilization. That is, to put 
it simply, a wage freeze. 
  It is quite obvious that it is much easier to suppress 
inflation by combining a restriction on emission with a 
restriction on income. Here one must clearly see that it is a 
question of restricting the wages of "laborers," and that this 
measure, with its unquestionable effectiveness, is related, in 
the first place, to the existence of a conscious desire to 
eliminate inflation, and on the other hand, to the presence in 
the government of self-confidence and a political mandate which 
is the only thing that can make it possible for it to be solved 
by such an extremely unpopular measure. Our government is not 
attempting to do this, and it is somehow awkward to accuse it of 
this, unless one has in mind a compulsion for suicide. 
  On the other hand, our government, and specifically the 
Ministry of Labor, headed by Mr. Melikyan, is professing an 
alternative approach to the income policy, that is, the struggle 
for its (the income's) control so beloved by the broad masses. 
The staff members of Mr. Melikyan's department are not at all 
inclined toward productive activity, and have obviously done a 
lot of reading of the newspaper PRAVDA, which particularly loves 
to stir up not fully intelligible information on the 
unprecedented gap between incomes of various groups of the 
Russian population. Since the president sharply expressed to the 
government his concern for the lack of reform activity, the 
Ministry of Labor, trying not to lag behind other departments, 
hastened to make a show of its activity. Moreover, in the most 
inoffensive and at the same time purely populist form. 
  No real harm will come from the initiative of the Ministry 
of 
Labor on introducing a more "progressive" income tax. Or rather, 
nothing will result from it at all, since all countrymen who are 
more or less oriented to the situation know that for a long time 
now no one has revealed his real income, if it exceeds a certain 
level. There are innumerable, fully legal, ways of getting any 
part of a personal income out from under taxation. 
  In a country where the entire real legal support of economic 
interrelations between all the participants in economic life is 
implemented exclusively by gangsters, where the state is 
incapable of providing a guarantee of even one payment, Mr. 
Melikyan has decided to regulate incomes. Let him submit the 
plan of his socialist initiative to the Mr. Gangsters and ask 
them if they will permit him to tax their indecently high 
incomes more "fairly." 
  I do not think that Mr. Melikyan will turn to the gangsters, 
since he is pursuing no specific economic goals with his 
project. Just as the entire government as a whole pursues no 
such goals, since it consistently portrays some sort of efforts 
to reform and regulate some abstract picture of economic life, 
which has no relation to reality.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Maryasov: "Good Seeds--the Foundation of the </F>
Harvest"] 
  [Text] Recently the collegium of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Food at its meeting considered the Russian 
Federation draft Law on Seeds. This question, as they say, is 
urgent. At the present time there are no legislative acts in the 
country regulating production, procurements, sale, and 
utilization of seeds and planting material. 
  The experience of countries with a developed market economy 
shows that the creation of this kind of legal base is possible 
only on the basis of recognition of unified production 
principles, certification of seeds, and their introduction into 
commercial circulation. It is these principles that make up the 
foundation of the proposed draft. The law provides legal 
foundations for the activity of producers and consumers of seeds 
and protects their rights. 
  The system for growing seeds of agricultural crops is formed 
from the production of original, elite, reproduction, and hybrid 
seeds. It is stipulated that the production and utilization of 
seeds of strains included in the register of selection 
achievements is done only by certified legal entities and 
individuals, in observance of the exclusive right of the patent 
holders. 
  In order to deliver seeds to regions that do not produce 
them 
or have limited possibilities of producing them and to render 
assistance in cases of natural disasters the draft law envisions 
the creation of a federal branch seed supply. The draft law 
especially stipulates that the state client for the formation of 
the federal insurance supply of seeds is the Ministry of 
Agricultural and Food of the Russian Federation. 
  For the purpose of stimulating procurements of seeds for the 
federal insurance supply there is to be advanced payment of 50 
percent of the cost of the delivery volume contracted for and 
also compensation for the producers of the original seeds for 50 
percent of the costs related to their production and all 
expenditures on the creation of insurance and carryover supplies 
of these seeds. 
  A great deal of attention is devoted to control methods that 
contribute to improving the quality of seeds. 
  According to the draft law all seed and planting material 
used for planting is subject to testing for grade and planting 
qualities with the issuance of the corresponding documents--a 
certificate (upon sale), and in other cases--a certification of 
the quality of the seeds. 
  In order to monitor the observance of normative-technical 
and 
technological documentation in the production, procurement, 
storage, transportation, and utilization of seeds, the position 
of state inspector for seed control is being introduced with the 
assignment of the corresponding authority. At the same time 
liability for violation of the law has been determined.

<F P=106> [Article by I. Gridasov, chief of the Main Administration of </F>
Crop Growing of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the 
Russian Federation: "On the Course of Field Work"] 
  [Text] According to data of the State Committee on 
Statistics of Russia, as of 25 April 1994 in the Northern 
Caucasus region and the south of the Volga area the weather 
conditions and the moisture content of the soil have been 
favorable for the growth and development of winter crops. They 
are mainly in the stage of stem extension here. In the Central 
Chernozem region and the Central Volga area tillering of winter 
crops is continuing and on the rest of the territory of Russia 
they have resumed vegetation. 
  In Russia as a whole the condition of winter crops is 
characterized by the following figures: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |(millions of hectares)                             | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                         |1994                     |1993                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Planted (total)          |15.5                     |19.2                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Good and satisfactory    |12.6                     |17.6                     | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Dead and thin            |2.9                      |1.6                      | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Winter crops suffered considerably more during the course of 
wintering in Krasnodar Kray, where 34 percent of the planted 
areas have died off or are thin, and Voronezh (40), Rostov (37), 
Volgograd (30) and Belgorod (29 percent) Oblasts. At the present 
time repair work is being done on the planted areas and they are 
being top dressed with mineral fertilizers. In the southern 
regions winter crops have been replanted and underplanted on an 
area of 1.1 million hectares as compared to 113,000 as of this 
date last year, and top dressing has been applied to only 2 
million hectares, which is 1.6 million less than last year. 
  Field work is being done in 38 regions. Spring crops have 
already been planted on 5.207 million hectares or 1.250 million 
hectares more than last year. 
  This year agricultural commodity producers are experiencing 
great difficulties with the acquisition of mineral fertilizers. 
As of 1 April there were only 1.2 tonnes on the farms or half as 
much as last year. The expected deliveries during April-June 
will amount to 0.8-1.0 million tonnes. Thus Russia as a whole 
will apply 8.4 million tonnes of them (4 times) less than the 
average annual level during 1986-1990. This will lead to a crop 
shortfall of about 30 million tonnes of agricultural products 
translated into grain. 
  According to forecasts, in 1994 the phytosanitary situation 
is expected to be difficult (increased damage from locusts, beet 
webworm, pests and diseases of grain crops and potatoes, and 
increased weediness of the fields). 
  At the same time the supply of pesticides (taking into 
account the amounts left over on the farms and Selkhozkhimiya 
bases and also the amounts earmarked for production by the 
plants) for various crops will amount to 5-50 percent, and seed 
disinfectants to 60 percent. 
  According to data from local agricultural organs, in Russia 
as a whole a sufficient quantity of high-grade seeds of 
oil-bearing crops has been stored except for sunflowers for feed 
purposes--the shortage will be made up for with corn seeds. The 
complete required supply of seeds of spring grain crops, 
vegetables, melon crops, flax, and potatoes is on hand.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Tsukhlo, head of the Market Survey Laboratory </F>
of the Institute of Economic Problems of the Transitional 
Period: "Effective Demand Remains the Most Painful Problem for 
Industrial Workers"] 
  [Text] According to the assessment of enterprise 
directors polled, the April slump in industrial production 
slowed things down a bit. 
  The market surveys made by the Institute of Economic 
Problems 
of the Transitional Period are conducted regularly among the 
directors of industrial enterprises, and pursue the goal of 
revealing their general ideas on future economic trends. It is 
worth noting that the opinions of these respondents are more 
than just opinions, since they can in themselves have a 
substantial influence on the development of the situation, as 
feedback. 
<H8>  Evaluation of the Current Situation </H8>
  Essentially, the expectation of a further drop has been 
losing its keenness lately. This was recorded in machine 
building and the construction industry, while reports of an 
increase in the scale of output cutback came from enterprises of 
the woodworking and light sectors. In April, 28 percent of the 
enterprises rated production stabilization as "normal"; this 
situation did not suit 72 percent of the respondents, who had 
retained their output volume. 
  The general slowdown in the recession led to a reduction in 
the proportion of "below normal" evaluations of the current 
production volume. Nevertheless, 90 percent of the enterprises 
in the machine building and light industry were dissatisfied 
with their output volumes. The answers of "normal" were 
significant (30-40 percent) in 1994 only in the woodworking and 
food sectors. Of the enterprises considering their production 
volume normal, only 42 percent evaluate the demand as the same; 
for the rest of the respondents from this group, the demand was 
insufficient. 
  In the 1st quarter of 1994, the demand for industrial goods 
continued to decrease. The balance remained at the level of the 
4th quarter of 1993 (-60 percent). A year ago this indicator was 
zero, which attested to the stabilization of the demand in the 
1st quarter of 1993. The strongest reduction in demand is now 
noted in machine building and woodworking. 
  Evaluations of the demand during the four months of 1994 
remained at an extremely low level: 84-87 percent of the 
enterprises considered the demand for their products to be 
unsatisfactory. A critical situation has formed in the machine 
building plants -- 99 percent of them assessed the amount of 
demand as "below normal." The maximum proportion of the "normal" 
answers were obtained in the woodworking industry (15 percent, 
March -- 23 percent). 
  The reaction to the poor demand was more coincident in 
April: 
56 percent of the enterprises with unsatisfactory demand were 
prepared to lower production (March -- 50 percent), and 26 
percent were prepared to not raise prices (March -- 10 percent). 
  In the 1st quarter of 1994, the enterprises' provision with 
raw material and materials dropped. In general, this process 
took place in the light (76 percent of the answers -- "below 
normal"), woodworking (69 percent) and machine building (68 
percent) sectors. In the food industry, 60 percent of the 
enterprises considered their raw material reserves normal. 
  In April, the poll recorded a small drop in surplus reserves 
of finished products -- the proportion of "above normal" answers 
dropped from 59 to 51 percent. The most substantial reduction 
occurred in the machine building (balance was 39 percent, March 
-- 49 percent), woodworking (29 percent, March -- 38 percent) 
and light (61 percent, March -- 73 percent) sectors of industry. 
Surplus reserves of finished products force 58 percent of the 
enterprises to decrease production and 33 percent -- to not 
raise prices. 
  The load of the production capacities on the whole for 
industry was 54 percent in April (56 percent in January 1994). A 
reduction in this indicator occurred only in machine building 
(46 percent, January-- 51 percent) and the light industry (47 
percent, January -- 59 percent). 
  Provision with orders for the year, on the average for 
industry, was cut in half and constituted 4.4 months in April 
1994. The maximum reduction took place in the woodworking (from 
7.6 to 2 months), light (from 7.3 to 2.2) and machine building 
(from 8.8 to 3.6) sectors. The enterprises of the petrochemical 
and food industries reported approximately the same provision as 
the year before. An increase in the indicator was recorded only 
in the construction industry (from 5.2 to 5.4 months). 
  Some 54 percent of the enterprises reported surplus 
production capacities in April 1994 (April 1993 -- 29 percent). 
Most of these evaluations were obtained in machine building (58 
percent, April 1993 --35 percent) and light industry (57 
percent, April 1993 -- 27 percent). 
  Effective demand still remains the most painful problem for 
industry --80 percent of the enterprises indicated it as a 
restraining factor (January 1994 -- 78 percent). In second place 
-- a shortage of working capital (61 percent, January -- 62 
percent). A shortage of skilled personnel holds a distant third 
place (17 percent, January -- 19 percent). 
<H8>  Predictions and Expectations </H8>
  An increase in expectations of a production slump continued 
at the enterprises in April: the proportion of "will drop" 
answers reached 54 percent (March -- 49 percent); given the 
retaining of predictions of a production increase for 10 percent 
of the enterprises the balance was -44 percent. Increases in the 
scope of the recession are anticipated at the enterprises of the 
light (-71 percent, -40 percent in March), woodworking (-54 
percent, -8 percent in March) and machine building (-54 percent, 
-46 percent in March) sectors. The probability of an increase is 
retained only in the construction industry. 
  The price predictions of the enterprises changed 
substantially in April. The proportion of producers not 
intending to raise prices rose to 26 percent (March -- 8 
percent). Anti-inflationary intentions of this sort have not 
been recorded since July 1992. The minimum inclination toward 
raising prices is shown by the enterprises of the light and food 
sectors (balances were respectively +48 percent and +60 
percent). In machine building, this indicator dropped to +79 
percent (+89 percent in March), and in the woodworking sector -- 
to +69 percent (+92 percent in March). 
  Predictions of a reduction in employment were recorded in 
April 1994 among 62 percent of the enterprises (April 1993 -- 30 
percent). The greatest cutbacks are likely in the machine 
building (balance equals -73 percent, -57 percent in the 1st 
quarter), light (-71 percent, -14 in the 1st quarter) and 
woodworking (-69 percent, -20 percent in the 1st quarter) 
sectors of industry. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-061-33A>      Expected Changes in Production Volume </FIG>


   --72 percent of the enterprises are not satisfied with the 
stabilization of their production. 
  --Demand continues to drop at the former rate. 
  --99 percent of the machine building plants do not have 
sufficient demand for their products.&lt;/graphic&gt; 


<FIG ID=JPRS-USR-061-34A>      Expected Changes in Prices </FIG>


  -  The enterprises of the food industry are the best 
provided with raw material.

the 
industrial enterprises. 
  -  Over half of the enterprises expect a cut in their output in 
the next few months.

the 
enterprises in April (March -- 8 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada, member of the </F>
Committee on Economic Policy: "The 1994 Budget: Revision Is 
Dangerous, Correctives Are Needed. The State Duma Acted 
Correctly, Accepting the Russian Federation's 1994 Federal 
Budget in Principle and Giving the Government Time To Perfect 
It"] 
  [Text] Of course, the budget is not designed to accomplish 
any major national priorities (scientific-technical, social, or 
whatever) or even to get out of the economic crisis, but only to 
maintain a more or less stable position in the context of the 
crisis. 
  But it is exactly what a budget can be that is oriented 
toward a moderately stern financial policy, taking account of 
present Russian realities. And I think that any major abrupt 
changes in the draft could induce social and political 
destabilization, even the kind of changes that are objectively 
progressive, for example further decentralizing the budget or 
reducing the percentage of state spending in the gross domestic 
product. 
  Nevertheless, the draft budget brings up a number of 
questions, questions that are so serious that, in my opinion, 
the government has to answer them. 
  The draft budget states, for example, that planned revenues 
from privatization in 1994 are estimated in the amount of 148 
billion rubles or, at the rate of exchange this year, less than 
85 million dollars. Why such a small amount? The first stage of 
privatization, during which state property was handed out almost 
free of charge, comes to an end starting 1 July, and sales for 
money begin. The government will have another half year to 
obtain a real monetary return to the budget from privatization. 
Why are revenues from that source planned in amounts several 
times smaller than last year, taking anticipated inflation into 
account? There is money in the country, after all, as is 
indicated by the amounts of capital being taken abroad. 
  What does the government intend to do to attract at least 
some of the national capital that is flowing out of Russia in 
the privatization process? I wish it would explain why efforts 
to activate foreign participation in privatization have been so 
ineffective that real revenues from privatization in the draft 
budget are being reduced. Only by getting to the bottom of these 
questions can we make a decision on this item of the budget. 
  There are also many questions regarding the budget revenue 
source represented by import duties, total collections of which 
should come to 500 million dollars in 1994, given taxable 
imports in the amount of 21.4 billion dollars. Recent decisions 
in this field indicate that the government has no long-term 
foreign trade policy and that it is conducting a policy serving 
the interests of Russia's industrialists at the expense of the 
interests of Russia's consumers. Moreover, this protectionism 
embodies neither priorities nor time frames. 
  Especially puzzling is the introduction of duties on imports 
of modern equipment, without which any structural restructuring 
and modernization of Russia's industry is unthinkable. At a time 
when Western countries have dissolved COCOM and are relaxing 
their bans on deliveries of modern machinery and equipment to 
Russia, our government is instituting prohibitive duties on 
imports thereof. This protection of uncompetitive national 
industrialists dooms the country to technological backwardness. 
  Analyzing the revenue items of the proposed budget, you have 
to conclude that it underrates the potential of the source 
represented by transactions with state securities. Of course, it 
is more difficult to implement such transactions than to take 
soft 10-percent loans from the Central Bank--in other words, 
from the printing press. However, actively mobilizing the 
population's money resources, although it is more complicated, 
does have an anti-inflationary effect. Before agreeing to the 
proposed structure of budget revenues, I should like our 
government to tell us what its approach is to the use of 
domestic state loans as a source of budget revenues. 
  As for budget expenditures, without changing their overall 
amounts it is possible and necessary to change the proportion of 
expenditures on certain items. 
  Spending on fundamental research and scientific-technical 
progress--4.2 trillion rubles--seems way too low. Yet this is 
practically the only competitive potential the country has (not 
counting raw materials)! Not only that, the share of budget 
expenditures on science and technology is being reduced from 2.5 
to 2.3 percent compared with last year. One-quarter of all 
expenditures are appropriated for the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and all its branches. It is unclear why this percentage 
is so low, considering that the Russian Academy of Sciences has 
always been the principal base of fundamental research in the 
country. 
  Another source of puzzlement is the sharp increase in the 
share of spending to support the "civil" state apparatus. Plans 
call for increasing this amount by 1.5 times--from 1.4 to 2.1 
percent. Why such a big increase? To some extent we can justify 
a reasonable increase in the size of the state administrative 
apparatus in subjects of the Federation and on the city, rayon, 
and other local levels, and expenditures to support it. 
Decentralization is bringing about an increase in the size of 
the counterpart apparatus in the localities. But not in the 
Federal apparatus! Yet the size of the apparatus of the Federal 
ministries and departments increased by 2.4 times in 1991-1993. 
Meanwhile, the number of workers on the republic, oblast, kray, 
and other levels of authority declined by 1.2 times--that is, to 
half the size. 
  Before approving that part of the budget, we need to study 
the causes of the absolute and relative growth of budget 
expenditures on state administration in order to reduce them as 
much as possible, and also to take measures to reduce the growth 
of the Federal bureaucracy, and if possible, reduce its size. 
Incidentally, the share of expenditures on the Federal court 
system and procuracy bodies is to be reduced from 0.7 to 0.6 
percent. Is this compatible with the necessity of strengthening 
judicial and juridical institutions in the framework of building 
a rule-of-law state? 
  I think there are reserves for reducing military spending, 
which is 20.3 percent of the budget or 5.1 percent of the gross 
domestic product (compared to 4.6 percent last year). And this 
does not count major appropriations on closed 
administrative-territorial formations of the Defense Ministry, 
which is a separate item. That high share of military 
expenditures is something our country can hardly afford. 
  The budget's declining social orientation is also cause for 
disappointment. In the new budget, the share of expenditures on 
social needs, including education, health, culture, and so on, 
is being reduced from 7.8 to 6.2 percent. It is unclear, also, 
how we are to finance the professional-qualifications retraining 
of unemployed persons, whose numbers may rise substantially. In 
this regard, a special Federal program needs to be adopted if we 
want to avert serious social collisions.

Crop Growing of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the 
Russian Federation: "On the Course of Field Work"] 
  [Text] At the end of the first 10 days of May over a large 
part of the European territory of Russia the weather was mainly 
warm with small amounts of precipitation. The air temperature in 
the non-Chernozem zone rose to 10-15 degrees, and in the Central 
Chernozem region, the Northern Caucasus, and the Volga area, to 
15-20 degrees. 
  In the Central Urals and the southern oblasts of Western and 
Eastern Siberia it became considerably cooler. In many regions 
there was rain, and in Chelyabinsk Oblast--snow. In Eastern 
Siberia during the night hours the temperature dropped to minus 
3-9 degrees. The rates of field work slowed up in these regions. 
  In the Far East, as usual, the weather was unstable. The 
precipitation that fell here impeded field work. 
  The condition of winter crops in the Russian Federation as a 
whole is worse than in 1993. Especially large areas have had to 
be replanted in the Northern Caucasus, the Volga area, and the 
Central Chernozem oblasts. The condition of the perennial 
grasses basically corresponds to the average values over many 
years. They did not survive the winter quite as well in the 
Northwestern, several regions of the Central, the Central 
Chernozem, and the Eastern Siberian regions. The sprouting of 
grasses is at the usual level and only in the Central region are 
the grasses somewhat behind in their growth. 
  In Krasnodar Kray the height of the alfalfa stand has 
reached 
30-40 centimeters and in some places 60, and in Rostov Oblast 
has reached 40 centimeters. They will be ready for harvesting in 
Krasnodar Kray on 20 May and in Rostov Oblast on 25 May. 
  In Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, Rostov Oblast, and the 
republics of the Northern Caucasus planting of spring grain 
crops has been completed. Mass planting is continuing in the 
Central Chernozem, Central, Volgo-Vyatka, Volga, and other 
regions. The majority of farms in the Urals and Siberia have 
begun field work. 
  According to data of the State Committee on Statistics of 
Russia, on agricultural enterprises spring crops have been 
planted on 19.228 million hectares, which is 3 million hectares 
less than during the same period of last year. The rates of 
planting have been negatively affected by the reduction of the 
machinery and tractor fleet on the farms and the shortage of 
mineral fertilizers, means of plant protection, and other 
material and technical resources. An alarming situation has 
developed with respect to technical equipment for procuring 
feeds. During the past three years the number of mowers has 
decreased by 126,000, rakes by 38,000, press-pickups by 16,000, 
and feed harvesting combines by 4,300 units. 
  In Stavropol Kray spring field work will require 99,000 
tonnes of fertilizer and there are only 37,700 tonnes available. 
This is half as much as last year. Nitrogen top dressing of 
winter crops alone will require 45,000 tonnes while 25,000 
tonnes are available. The situation is similar in other 
republics, krays, and oblasts of Russia. 
  Because of the shortage of mineral fertilizers only 20 
percent of the winter crops have been top dressed in Bryansk 
Oblast, 25 percent in Voronezh, 21 percent in Tambov, 23 percent 
in Volgograd, 26 percent in Ulyanovsk, 40 percent in Stavropol 
Kray, and 60 percent in Rostov Oblast. In the Russian Federation 
as a whole winter crops have been top dressed on 3.2 million 
hectares as compared to 4 million in 1993. 
  There are difficulties with the provision of fuel and 
lubricants and on many farms the technical equipment is fueled 
"right out of the tanker." 
  The main reason for the shortage of material and technical 
resources is that the farms have no money. Up to this point the 
grain receiving enterprises have not paid their bills for grain 
for state resources for last year and the debt amounts to more 
than R280 billion. The farms are unwilling to take out credit at 
213 percent for fear of going into debt.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Zakharchenko, Plant Protection Branch </F>
academician-secretary and Russian Agricultural Academy 
academician: "The Crops Can Be Preserved Only by Preventing the 
Development of Pests and Diseases on the Fields"] 
  [Text] Spring is moving rapidly toward the north and the 
front of field work is becoming broader. When conducting the 
planting campaign it is important to recall that planted areas 
must be protected from pests, diseases, and weeds, which even in 
favorable years bring about losses of more than one-fourth of 
the crops that are raised. Under the conditions of the extremely 
low level of the culture of farming, which is typical of the 
present economic situation of the farms in the country as a 
whole, the possibilities of agrotechnical measures of plant 
protection are especially limited. Protective measures have to 
be conducted when there are practically no systems of farming 
and crop rotations adapted to the specific natural and economic 
conditions. Moreover, this year on every seventh hectare the 
grain crops have been planted with seeds that have not been 
conditioned with respect to weediness and the same is true from 
every fourth hectare planted in sunflowers. In essence, seeds of 
weed plants will be planted on 10 million hectares. The level of 
application of mineral fertilizers is also extremely low. 
  Under these conditions the work for disinfecting the seeds 
is 
proceeding surprisingly slowly. Only 0.5 million tonnes of seed 
material have been prepared in this way and yet it will be 
necessary to plant about 10 million tonnes. Consequently, even 
at the beginning of the growing period the sprouting seeds and 
subsequently also the young plants will be unprotected. In the 
central and northern regions it is not too late to disinfect the 
seeds right before planting. 
  This pertains especially to seed potatoes. In recent years 
in 
zones of commercial potato growing there has been development of 
aggressive new races of phytophthorosis that last year attacked 
at least one-third of the crop. The new races sexually form 
spores that are capable of surviving in the soil for a long 
time. Infection essentially accumulates before the tubers are 
planted in the soil. The danger of soil infection can be reduced 
by skipping no less than three to four years before growing 
potatoes on the field again. But in order to guarantee 
protection from soil and tuber infection with phytophthorosis 
and other diseases it is important to prepare the seed material. 
  Before planting or while it is being done it is expedient to 
use for disinfection nitraphen (60 percent paste at 0.6 
kilograms per tonne), polycarbacine (80 percent s.p. [expansion 
not identified]), homecine (cuprosan) (80 percent s.p. at 0.25 
kilograms per tonne) using 3-10 liters of the liquid per tonne 
of seed material. It is important to inspect the planted areas 
during the growing period and above all on areas where potatoes 
were grown during the preceding year. For reliable protection it 
is necessary to create a reserve of fungicides for four to six 
treatments, including two-system preparations. Before the 
beginning of the work it would be expedient to make up a 
complete fleet of machines used for protecting plants, to 
regulate and adjust them to the norms for expenditure of the 
liquid that are set for the specific conditions, and to 
determine the places for taking in water and filling the 
equipment with preparations so as not to allow pollution of 
water sources and other elements of the environment, and also to 
train personnel. 
  Even now it is clear that agriculture will lose the products 
raised on the field, paying its tribute to the pests, diseases, 
and weeds, because of omissions in the art of farming and the 
inadequate level of plant protection. But it is also clear that 
losses can be reduced to a minimum by efficiently organizing 
protective measures and orienting them to extreme conditions. 
  Especially fixed attention must be devoted to protection 
work 
in regions with intensive farming, and above all the Northern 
Caucasus. According to the results of an analysis of the 
phytosanitary condition here it is suggested that they reduce 
the cereal crops and corn in the crop rotations and increase the 
areas planted in pulse crops and other nongrain crops. It would 
be expedient to revise the system for picking and selecting 
strains, giving priority to those that are resistant to pests 
and diseases, to increase the role of phytological evaluations 
of seeds and planting material, and to step up the monitoring of 
unsanctioned shipment of uninspected planting material from 
abroad. On the whole it is necessary to revise the system of 
farming in order to adapt it more to the real natural and 
economic conditions. This would contribute to solving problems 
of plant protection, whose importance is difficult to 
overestimate. After all, in 1993 because of infestation with 
click beetles alone 6,000 hectares of sugar beets had to be 
replanted. The overall losses were estimated at R1.5 billion in 
1993 prices. Moreover, grain from Krasnodar winter wheat raised 
last year is dangerous to the health. Out of 1.6 million tonnes 
of grain procured in Krasnodar Kray, 1.5 million tonnes are 
infested with fusiarial toxins. 
  There is a significantly greater danger of the development 
of 
pyriculariosis on rice fields, on corn fields--southern 
helmynphosporiosis, and on sunflower fields--phomopsis blight. 
  Last year's experience, however, showed that with well 
arranged work of scientific institutions and the state plant 
protection service it is possible to keep the situation with 
dangerous pest organisms under control. Thus thanks to measures 
that were taken it was possible to avoid losses of crops from 
locusts. 
  The organizational measures taken by the quarantine service 
and agricultural organs made it possible to significantly reduce 
the danger of southern helmynthosporiosis on areas planted in 
corn and to keep other quarantine objects under control. 
  This year is much more difficult than last year. Therefore 
it 
will be necessary to take thoroughly considered steps to 
organize protective measures. There is no doubt that an 
important role must be played by agrotechnical measures, whose 
implementation in and of itself creates preconditions for 
reliable plant protection. But specialists must give prompt 
warning of places of possible appearance of danger from the 
development of harmful organisms and provide measures to 
suppress them. 
  The replanting in the south of the country of about 30 
percent of the winter wheat that froze and became extremely thin 
and more than 80 percent of the barley with early spring crops 
using basically treated seeds does not cause alarm. But the 
field inspections conducted there show that on 10 percent of the 
area the winter crops have been infested by snow mold and about 
5 percent by perenophorosis. In the fight against these diseases 
and also other causes of root and root area rot, it is effective 
to use benlate (0.4 kilograms per hectare) mixed with potassium 
salt (10 kilograms per hectare) and also sportak (1 liter per 
hectare). 
  The warm, dry weather in April created the danger of the 
development of root rot and contributed to the laying of eggs of 
cereal leaf beetle. Therefore it is suggested that treatment 
with pyretroid insecticides (decis, ambush, karate, sumi-alpha 
0.1-0.2 liters per hectare) be done selectively, taking into 
account the number of pests, not before 50-70 percent of the 
larvae have hatched and when there are no less than one of them 
per stalk. It is possible to use a mixture of half norms of 
pyretroids and metaphos. 
  In the southern grain producing regions pine shoot moths 
have 
begun to migrate to the fields planted in cereal grass crops. We 
must not miss the time when the larvae emerged from their mines 
and enter the antrum of the upper leaf of the plant, which lasts 
four to six days. When there are more than 20 larvae per square 
meter it is expedient to treat with metaphos, malathion, or 
sumithion (1 liter per hectare). It is predicted that there will 
be focal spreading on corn of southern helmynthosporiosis and 
stalk rot. If the first half of the summer is damp, fusariosis 
is expected to develop. 
  Under the conditions that have developed with the relatively 
severe winter there is a depression of the traditional pests of 
grain crops in the southern regions--grain carabid and harmful 
chinch bugs. The danger is at the level of the many-year average. 
  This year the problem of providing agricultural commodity 
producers with pesticides and biological substances could be 
eliminated; all the necessary preparations are available for 
this. But, unfortunately, since the farms have no money there 
are difficulties with payment. 
  Measures for fighting against extreme situations on the 
fields are of a statewide nature. Even at the present time it is 
necessary to allot funds and material and technical resources 
for conducting them. Delay could lead to excessive losses and 
costs. 
  Scientific research institutions could play an important 
role 
in solving this problem. It would be expedient even now to 
create all-Russian precision centers for monitoring especially 
dangerous diseases, pests, and quarantine bio-agents, and also 
regional control centers. On the basis of oblast (kray) plant 
protection stations located in the zones with large volumes of 
production of the main agricultural crops it is necessary to 
create points for phytopathological and entomological analysis 
and forecasting of extreme situations.

<F P=106> [Federal Employment Service [FSZ] report: "The Rate of </F>
Increase in the Number of Unemployed Has Fallen"] 
  [Text] As of 1 May 1994, the State Employment Service [sic] 
had registered 1.4596 million citizens who were not engaged in 
work activity, including 1.18 million who were unemployed. 
During April the number of citizens who were unoccupied 
increased by 95,900 and the number who were unemployed increased 
by 96,500 over the preceding month. 
  Citizens who were dismissed from enterprises, organizations, 
and institutions account for 25.2 percent of the total number of 
persons who are unoccupied. 
  For the first 4 months of 1994 as a whole, the number of 
unoccupied citizens rose by 375,100 (1.3 times as much). 
  The number of unemployed citizens registered by the State 
Employment Service increrased by 344,400 (1.4 times as much) 
over the first 4 months of 1994. 
  The unemployment level (the ratio between the number of 
registered unemployed and the number of able-bodied persons in 
the population of working age) was 1.4 percent for Russia as a 
whole on 1 May 1994. 
  The number of vacancies reported to the State Employment 
Service increased by 35,600 during April, reaching 325,000 on 1 
May. Some 83 percent of the vacancies are for workers and 17 
percent are for white-collar workers. 
  In Russia as a whole, an average of 4.5 persons are 
unoccupied and 3.6 persons are unemployed for each vacancy 
reported to the State Employment Service. In a number of 
regions, the situation in the labor market is marked by more 
tension. There are 255 unoccupied citizens laying claims for one 
vacancy in the Ingush Republic, 51 citizens in Yaroslavl Oblast, 
from 31 to 35 in the Nenetsk and Aginsk Buryat autonomous okrugs 
and the Dagestan and Chuvash republics, and from 27 to 29 in 
Pskov, Bryansk, and Sakhalin oblasts, the Komi-Permyak 
Autonomous Okrug, and the Republic of Northern Osetia. 
  There were 38,100 citizens taking part in paid public work 
in 
the first 4 months of 1994, which is 1.7 times more than in the 
same period last year. Some 18,600 Russians were engaged in 
public work in April 1994.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Gusev, the head of the State Tax </F>
Service of the Russian Federation, by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 
correspondent Nikolay Ulyanov, under the rubric "Firsthand"; 
place and date not given: "Russia Has More Than 40 Taxes and 
Duties: Last Year the Tax Service Collected R38 Trillion and 
$380 Million"] 
  [Text] The Russian State Tax Service lately is 
increasingly subjected to attacks by both entrepreneurs and 
members of the "fourth estate." Complaints against the tax 
service frequently are mutually exclusive and range from 
accusations of incompetent tax collection, which hurts the 
revenue part of the federal budget, to accusations of 
thoughtlessly excessive tax burden on trade and producer 
organizations, which hampers the development of entrepreneurship 
in Russia. A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent asked Vladimir 
Gusev, the head of the State Tax Service of the Russian 
Federation, to respond to these complaints. 
  [Ulyanov] Vladimir Vasilyevich, the tax reform in Russia has 
been under way for two years. Over this time, a principally new 
tax system has been created. What are its general features, and 
how similar is it to tax systems of other countries? 
  [Gusev] Briefly, it is a total of more than 40 types of 
taxes, duties, and dues that represent a variety of forms of 
taxation; the tax service carries out control over their receipt 
into the consolidated federal budget. Largely, the same 
principles of tax system design and structure are typical in the 
West and in the world practice in general. 
  The forms of taxation depend on the source and form of 
income 
(profit, earned income, interest, dividends, etc.); on whether 
property itself is taxed (land, real estate, or other property, 
etc.) or the act of its transfer (inheritance or gift); income 
formed in production or the process of consumption, import and 
export of goods in and out of the territory of the country; and 
so on. On the basis of the experience of developed countries, 
the following main types of taxes have been introduced in 
Russia: tax on profit (income), property tax, and value-added 
tax, as well as other taxes on goods and services. 
  Both the level of revenue from the same kind of taxes and 
the 
tax rates of taxes of the same name differ considerably in 
different countries and also depend on the economic situation. 
For instance, income tax collected from physical persons in 
Russia last year amounted to 12 percent of the total volume of 
tax receipts, while in the United States it accounts for more 
than 45 percent of budget revenue. In Japan, one-fourth of the 
tax burden is composed of the corporate tax (tax on income of 
legal entities), which is approximately twice as high as the 
share of similar revenue in Great Britain and considerably 
higher than in Germany and the United States. The value-added 
tax is the highest in Germany and Great Britain. In Russia, 75 
percent of the budget revenue currently is formed by tax on 
profit and indirect taxes. 
  [Ulyanov] On the basis of the experience of two years of 
work, what changes need to be done to the Russian tax system? 
  [Gusev] In any case, nothing drastic. In order for the tax 
reform to be completely implemented, a certain time is required 
for the new tax relations to get established. Nevertheless, 
further improvement and fine-tuning of the system are needed, of 
course. For instance, currently the State Tax Service together 
with the Ministry of Finance is completing the preparation of 
the Law on Amendments to the Russian Federation Law on the 
Foundations of the Tax System in the Russian Federation. 
  We propose to considerably expand the right of local bodies 
of authority in setting regional and local taxes, to reduce the 
multitude of existing types of taxes, and make some other 
changes as well. Also submitted to the State Duma for 
consideration are the Law on Amendments to Some Russian 
Federation Laws With the Aim of Implementing Additional Measures 
on Timely and Complete Transfer of Taxes and Other Compulsory 
Payments Into the Budget, and draft amendments to seven tax 
laws, as well as the draft of the new version of the Law on Road 
Funds and a draft Law on Transportation Tax. 
  Under conditions of acute budget deficit and limited 
financial resources, it is important to establish procedures for 
forming and controlling the use of state nonbudget funds. In the 
estimate of the Russian State Committee on Statistics, the total 
volume of means in these funds amounted to 19.9 percent of the 
GDP, while the share of all tax revenue comprised 23.4 percent 
of the GDP. Hence the necessity to ensure rational use of these 
enormous means. 
  [Ulyanov] Do you feel some resistance to your work on the 
part of higher state bodies and regional leadership? 
  [Gusev] We have established very constructive relations in 
the government. All of our proposals--developed jointly with the 
Ministry of Finance on amendments and additions to tax laws--the 
government, after making certain changes, promptly submits for 
the consideration of the State Duma. How the work on the 
proposed draft laws will proceed in the State Duma we do not 
know yet, since we have no experience of working with it, but, 
in my opinion, there are currently no reasons for concern in 
this respect. 
  Relations with Russian Federation components and regions are 
another matter. Last year, and actually this one, too, we 
frequently had various problems and misunderstandings, and, in a 
number of cases, even conflict situations. For instance, last 
year 38 regions did not transfer the full amount of VAT into the 
federal budget, and 14 regions did not transfer a full amount of 
taxes on profit. With some republics (Tatarstan, Bashkortostan, 
Karelia, and Yakutia), agreements have been signed on the 
transfer of part of the tax collected on their territory into 
the federal budget. 
  Overall in 1993, the budget received more than R38 trillion 
and $340 million [as published] in tax revenue. The bulk of the 
income was received through tax on profit and indirect taxes 
(more than 74 percent of all revenue). Of other types of taxes, 
income tax from physical persons provided a steady flow of 
revenue. Last year resource fees and property taxes began to 
play a more serious role in forming the income part of the 
budget. 
  [Ulyanov] What kind of tax violations did you encounter most 
often last year? 
  [Gusev] The most typical violations were concealing or 
understating income, falsifying accounting data, incorrect 
application of tax rates and preferences, and depositing foreign 
currency earnings in foreign banks for the purpose of tax 
evasion. In these conditions, we considered it very important to 
monitor the activities of commercial banks, which by their 
actions often create conditions that help to conceal profit from 
taxation by illegally using the payments due to the budget as 
their credit resources. That is, dishonest businessmen deposit 
their receipts into accounts not registered with the tax organs. 
  In addition, tax laws are frequently violated in the part of 
tax revenue. For instance, an audit conducted by specialists of 
the State Tax Service's central staff in the Ingosstrakh 
joint-stock insurance society found understatement of income by 
more than R9 billion. 
  [Ulyanov] To what extent does the tax service personnel meet 
the tasks set for the service? 
  [Gusev] Overall, as of 1 May of this year, the tax system 
had 
a staff of more than 149,000. Of them, 96.8 percent have higher 
or vocational high school education (in the beginning of last 
year, this figure was lower--91.8 percent), including 50.9 
percent with higher education. The leading educational centers 
for training tax service specialists are the Financial 
Continuing Education Institute of the Russian Federation 
Ministry of Finance, the Financial Academy under the Russian 
Federation Government, and professional training centers in St. 
Petersburg and Nizhniy Novgorod, as well as continuing education 
courses in Kaluga. Currently similar retraining centers are 
being opened in other cities as well. 
  Successful interaction with the Organization of Economic 
Cooperation and Development, the EU Commission, and Denmark's 
Ministry of Taxation led to establishing in Moscow in September 
of last year an International Training Tax Center for training 
specialists for tax organizations. By the way, 300 specialists 
already have taken a training course there, and another 900 are 
currently studying there. Within the framework of this project 
and simply on the basis of bilateral relations, training and 
methodology seminars are held for the State Tax Service 
personnel in Russia and abroad, with the participation of the 
tax services of the United States, Denmark, Sweden, FRG, and 
France. 
  [Ulyanov] Taxpayers quite often complain that they cannot 
always find the new tax laws. What does your service do in this 
very important sphere of relations with the population? 
  [Gusev] Such complaints have indeed been received in the 
past, and frankly, they still come. The information service does 
not yet exist in the scope we have envisaged it. This does not 
mean, however, that we do not see the problem and do nothing 
about it. No, we have set up our press center, beefed it up with 
personnel and technical equipment. But we also have unused 
reserves. For instance, this year we plan to begin publishing 
VESTNIK NALOGOVOY SLUZHBY, in which we will publish, along with 
official documents, comments of our staff on various aspects of 
tax practice.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Tsekhanov, chief of the Federal </F>
Counterintelligence Service's Economic Counterintelligence 
Directorate, by Vladimir Klimov "only in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA"; 
date and place not given: "The Country Is Being Sold Off. 
Wholesale and Retail. Directorate Chief Vladimir Tsekhanov 
Reflects on the Struggle on the Economic Front"] 
  [Text] 
  [Klimov] What is the main sphere of questions that the 
Economic Counterintelligence Directorate is working on? 
  [Tsekhanov] The might, stability, and prosperity of a state 
are determined by the condition of its economy. But at the same 
time this is a state's tenderest, most sensitive spot. It is no 
accident that the developed countries' special services are 
shifting the center of gravity in their activity to the economic 
sphere. 
  The Economic Counterintelligence Directorate, which was the 
result of the amalgamation of two Russian Security Ministry 
directorates (the directorate for combating contraband and 
corruption and, partly, the economic security directorate), 
endeavors to organize the protection of vitally important 
spheres most at risk from external and internal threats. 
  These are above all priority state programs, including 
privatization, investment projects with federal status and 
foreign investors, the credit and finance sphere, foreign 
economic activity, and the sphere of the circulation of precious 
stones and metals. Such forms of economic crime as the 
smuggling of strategic raw materials and centrally allocated 
resources, the illegal arms trade, banking crimes -- including 
the laundering of huge sums obtained through criminal means -- 
represent a serious threat. International narcotics syndicates 
are making a beeline for Russia. The theft and resale of 
cultural assets and unlawful enterprise in the sphere of culture 
are becoming profitable business. The expansion of organized 
crime and its capital in the Russian economy has taken on 
threatening proportions. Such trends are directly connected 
with the growth of corruption in the organs of power and 
administration and the law-enforcement system. 
  [Klimov] What sphere of our economy attracts the most 
interest from foreign intelligence agents, Vladimir Stepanovich? 
Tell me as far as possible about cases of economic blackmail. 
  [Tsekhanov] It will seem strange to some people, but it is a 
fact that, with the end of the Cold War, the intelligence 
activity of foreign services in relation to the Russian economy 
has been stepped up. Countries of the former socialist camp and 
the Baltic have gotten in on the act. There is a clear tendency 
for priorities to shift from military to economic confrontation, 
with the aim of making Russia a raw materials adjunct of the 
economically developed countries, to do everything to prevent 
its access to the world high technologies markets, and to 
exclude Russia from the list of potential economic rivals. 
  And it is not a question here of some kind of pathological 
noxiousness on the part of our foreign partners. Let us look at 
it soberly. In planning their strategy, the developed countries 
endeavor at least to preserve the level of prosperity that they 
have already achieved or, if they succeed, to raise it. This is 
impossible relying only on internal resources. It is therefore 
important to ensure a stable supply of external stimuli and, as 
far as possible, to increase it. But in the modern, 
extraordinarily complex world, with its dwindling raw material 
and energy resources, it is extremely difficult to carry out 
such a policy. The weak links in the chain must be searched out 
and probed energetically. Today Russia has, unfortunately, 
become just such a weak link. 
  The expansion of cooperation with other countries and the 
attraction of foreign capital and advanced technologies into the 
Russian economy is beneficial to our country. But at the same 
time it is important to observe our own interests as much as 
possible and not to be a "sheep in the wolves' den," if you will 
pardon the expression. Foreign partners, incidentally, are not 
such bad guys; it is quite possible to get on with them, but 
only if you don't act dumb. 
  For instance, the Soros Foundation and the American 
Mathematical Society applied through the Russian Academy of 
Sciences to our mathematicians, requesting them to send their 
scientific articles to the United States for U.S. academics to 
assess. Thousands of our best authors would be paid $50 each 
for an article. Just consider -- $50 for information that could 
bring in millions! 
  [Klimov] One area of the directorate's activity is 
corruption in the higher echelons of power. It is already known 
that instances of the criminal abuse of power have been 
uncovered. Is it possible for you to speak about this? 
  [Tsekhanov] Corruption in the state service system is 
reaching epidemic proportions, discrediting the economic reforms 
and exerting a destructive influence on our way of life, our 
sense of justice, legality, and the social protection of our 
citizens. 
  In St. Petersburg criminal proceedings have been instituted 
against L. Savenkov, the city's deputy mayor, for organized 
smuggling. In Moscow V. Danilenko, the first deputy prefect of 
Moscow's Western Administrative District, has been charged with 
corruption. 
  In Pskov Oblast A. Kabanov, deputy chairman of the Oblast 
Committee for the Management of State Property, has been 
detained for organizing the illicit export of metals and import 
of arms. Unfortunately there are many such examples. 
  It is extremely difficult for the law-enforcement organs to 
investigate and stamp out corruption among leading officials. 
All the advantages of office and influence and connections in 
the top-ranking executive echelons are brought into play in 
order to oppose our work. Often the mass media are exploited to 
distort the nature of events or exert pressure on the 
law-enforcement organs investigating cases of corruption. 
  Sometimes curbing corruption among judges, public 
prosecutors, and deputies is seriously hampered by the 
excessively inflated guarantees of immunity of these officials. 
  [Klimov] How did the directorate collaborate with the 
commissions -- first Rutskoy's, then the Makarov-Ilyushenko 
commission? 
  [Tsekhanov] Different interdepartmental organs dealing in 
one way or another with questions of combating corruption have 
been set up from time to time. After the Russian Federation 
president's well-known 4 April 1992 edict "On Combating 
Corruption in the State Service System," sessions of the 
standing Interdepartmental Conference for Protecting Private and 
Public Interests Against Organized Crime and Corruption" (the 
"G. Burbulis Commission") began to be held fairly regularly. 
  The Russian Federation Security Council Interdepartmental 
Commission for Combating Crime and Corruption, which you have 
called the "Rutskoy" or "Makarov-Ilyushenko Commission," is 
still operating, although from time to time reports of its 
cessation of activities do appear. 
  It coordinates activity in the sphere of combating crime and 
elaborates appropriate proposals, recommendations, and documents 
of a conceptual and program character. Thus it was under the 
auspices of the Interdepartmental Committee that the All-Russia 
Conference on Questions of Combating Crime and Corruption was 
organized and held last year. For this conference we prepared 
analytical and statistical materials and proposals for draft 
statutory acts on questions of combating organized crime, 
smuggling, illegal international trafficking in narcotics, and 
corruption, which were included in the conference's final 
documents. The Commission organized work to prepare the Federal 
Program for Combating Crime for 1994-1995. 
  We keep the Russian Federation president informed about 
instances of corruption in the organs of state power. 
  [Klimov] How extensively has economic crime affected the 
law-enforcement organs? 
  [Tsekhanov] For the militia it is most difficult of all. 
Organized crime today possesses huge financial and material 
resources, is excellently technically equipped, and has great 
experience of opposition to the state. Not everyone can 
withstand such pressure. There are cases of betrayal of 
official interests, official abuses, mergers with criminal 
structures, illegal participation in entrepreneurial activity, 
and assistance in getting criminal proceedings dropped in return 
for bribes. For example, one month ago the illegal activity of 
an extensive criminal community with the participation of 
officers of the central apparatus of the MVD [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs], the Moscow Oblast and City Internal Affairs 
Main Directorates, and other militia subdepartments was 
uncovered. Orders from professional criminal groupings of the 
Moscow region to drop charges against their members under 
investigation for muggings, robbery, smuggling, and illegal 
possession of arms, and also to change preventive restrictions 
and reduce sentences imposed by the courts, were carried out in 
return for huge bribes. Criminal proceedings have been 
instituted, and the case has been referred to the Russian 
General Prosecutor's Office. 
  In 1993 alone, according to the records of the former 
Russian 
Federation Security Ministry, criminal proceedings were 
instituted against 39 officers of MVD organs, one Prosecutor's 
Office employee, and one court official, and more than 1,000 
employees of the internal affairs organs were disciplined for 
various abuses of public office. In the first quarter of 1994, 
according to federal counterintelligence records, criminal 
charges have been brought in nine cases against 14 MVD officers. 
There are four cases against officials of the Public 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  There is information on extortion of bribes by individual 
officials of the tax police for reducing punitive sanctions. 
Some of these officials have links with criminal structures and 
carry out their orders, passing to them official information and 
helping individual entrepreneurs to tax exemptions, receiving 
huge sums in return. There are cases of threats and 
psychological pressure against taxpayers and cases of forcing 
them to give bribes. 
  [Klimov] The narcotics trade is growing drastically in 
Russia. What is being done to oppose it? 
  [Tsekhanov] According to official estimates the turnover of 
narcotics reached the level of $150 million in our country last 
year. More than half of the narcotics in illegal circulation in 
Russia originate from outside its borders. They come mainly 
from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Lithuania, and the Central 
Asian states. 
  In recent times contraband deliveries of narcotics from 
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran have grown markedly. Cocaine 
from South America and the United States and other narcotics, 
new to this country, are increasingly appearing in Russia. On 
the other hand the smuggling of narcotics from Russia to 
Finland, Sweden, France, Germany, Austria, and Greece is on the 
increase. 
  The international narcotics business has manifestly 
intensified its interest in Russia. This is to be explained by 
the peculiarities of Russia's geographic position on the 
crossroads of transport routes and the huge, though as yet 
exploited, market in the demand for narcotics. There is reason 
to believe that, in addition to the traditional Balkan and 
Caucasus routes, a new international drugs route is being 
established from Southwest, South, and Southeast Asia to the CIS 
countries and West Europe. 
  One means of increasing effectiveness in the battle against 
the illegal circulation of narcotics is cooperation with the 
special services of a number of countries of the world. Of 
course, collaboration within the CIS receives priority attention. 
  [Klimov] What crimes, apart from false promissory notes, 
have appeared in the banking sphere? 
  [Tsekhanov] The scale of crime is becoming menacing, and the 
character of the crimes increasingly refined. The 
law-enforcement organs have managed to uncover and prevent 
losses totaling hundreds of billions of rubles from the use of 
false payment documents. 
  Representatives of the criminal world have made efficient 
use 
of the absence of a properly thought-out program to transform 
the existing credit and finance system and Russia's monetary 
circulation in conditions of the transition to the market; they 
have undertaken a series of large-scale illegal actions in 
1992-1994. Today we can confidently talk about the emergence of 
organized crime in this sphere. 
  Such forms of crime as false bankruptcies and professedly 
mistaken payment of money into the accounts of outside 
organizations and so forth have emerged. In recent times we 
have encountered "computer" crime, whereby large-scale 
embezzlement of funds is carried out by "cracking" banking data 
protection systems with the aid of an IBM, illegally obtaining 
credit through the use of false credit cards ("electronic" 
money), and pumping convertible currency abroad. The new 
electronic payments banking system is also in the criminals' 
sights. One cause of the growth in the number of these frauds 
are the gaping holes in Russian legislation. 
  [Klimov] What danger awaits us from the commercialization of 
the entire country? 
  [Tsekhanov] A "flight" of the ruble, whereby foreign 
currency actively penetrates the sphere of circulation and the 
ruble is squeezed out of internal circulation. The second 
calamity is a leak of capital from Russia. This question can be 
resolved only by combining administrative measures with the 
creation of an attractive investment climate. Plus legislative 
support. 
  And there is one further highly complex problem -- the 
concentration of huge sums of money in the hands of individuals 
and organizations having direct links with the criminal world. 
There is an ongoing process of laundering "dirty" money, both 
from Russia and abroad, and the active assimilation of private 
funds into the Russian economy through the establishment of 
control over commercial banking structures. 
  Many confidence tricksters and fraudsters, both Russian and 
foreign, have now appeared in the Russian market. The 
successfully thwarted losses which could have been inflicted by 
these dishonest people are frequently measured in tens of 
billions of rubles. Major financial fraud cannot fail to affect 
the condition of the state credit and monetary system. 
  [Klimov] Vladimir Stepanovich, what prevents even more 
effective work by your directorate? 
  [Tsekhanov] Dissatisfaction with the level of social 
protection and the uncertainty of the status of a state Federal 
Counterintelligence Service employee, the unending process of 
reorganization -- all this substantially reduces our level of 
efficiency and drives away professional cadres. Many trained 
officers have gone into the tax police, where the level of 
monetary support is far higher than in our directorate, and into 
other state structures. Commercial firms happily take on our 
boys, sometimes offering pay several times in excess of what 
they were previously earning. Former state security employees 
are valued for their high efficiency, professionalism, and 
ability to perform the most diverse tasks, and, of course, for 
their honesty and reliability.

<F P=106> [Interview with S. Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, </F>
by Vladimir Smyk, RIA NOVOSTI correspondent (especially for 
RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA); place and date not given: "At Magnitka, 
Hurrah!"] 
  [Text] The first stage of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill 
was put into operation at Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine on 
21 May. In connection with this RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA asked S. 
Afonin, chairman of Roskommetallurgiya, to answer a number of 
questions. 
  [Smyk] Serafim Zakharovich, even when the country's economy 
was on the rise, central newspapers reported an event of such 
scope in big headlines. But in our days it inspires us with 
special feeling: Not only bankruptcies of enterprises and the 
shutdown of main conveyers are today's reality. Of course, this 
is an emotional evaluation by a journalist. Do professionals 
subscribe to it? 
  [Afonin] Indeed, today, during a period when we face 
difficult questions and are engaged in a search for a way out of 
the crisis that has affected the economy, such concepts as 
"labor victory" sound unusual. However, for those that with 
their own hands built the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill and for those 
that will work on it--moreover, for all workers at the 
Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine--the day of 21 May was a true 
holiday. 
  [Smyk] What does the production line represent? 
  [Afonin] These are six roughing stands, through which a 
billet passes in stages. At the entry it is 250 mm thick. 
Passing a 1/2-km path, the slab turns into a sheet about 2 mm 
thick. Right after the roughing this rolled metal, a so-called 
plate, is of independent industrial significance. It is used for 
various kinds of structures in the machine-building and 
construction industry. It must be stated that the combine, 
before commissioning the first stage, found orders for plate, 
that is, expenditures on the construction of the project will 
begin to be recovered before the commissioning of the second 
stage. The 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill with an annual productivity of 
5 million tonnes of rolled metal (the real load will be 4 
million) will be commissioned in August. 
  [Smyk] Can existing rolling capacities coexist with the new 
ones? 
  [Afonin] No. Two obsolete mills are now being removed from 
service at the combine. In general, it must be said that the 
construction of the 2000 Hot-Rolling Mill represents a central 
moment in the reconstruction of the leader of Russian 
metallurgy--the Magnitogorsk Combine--carried out in three 
stages. 
  [Smyk] How many work places are vacated at the combine as a 
result of the reconstruction? 
  [Afonin] In all, 15,000. The program for the creation of new 
work places is being actively realized right now. People working 
with obsolete equipment under quite difficult conditions are 
offered a number of new production facilities, that is, of 
machine-building and construction specialization. A new bakery 
has been commissioned and a meat combine is on the eve of a 
start-up... Today the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine is a 
multispecialization joint-stock company--no one will remain 
without a job. The combine's modernization will have a 
beneficial effect on the working and living conditions of 
workers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Combine. The federal 
program for the retooling of metallurgy is being truly realized 
in this Ural city. 
  [Smyk] The next question concerns financing: How much did 
the 
2000 mill cost and how did you manage to find funds? 
  [Afonin] At present prices, approximately 1 trillion rubles. 
Its construction began at the end of the 1980's. Therefore, the 
combine managed to get substantial state support. It amounted to 
approximately 60 percent. Magnitka earned the rest of the money 
itself. 
  [Smyk] The situation has changed now. The new budget is 
another evidence of this. Can the federal program be fulfilled 
without strong state subsidies? 
  [Afonin] State support must be expressed in the government's 
creation of optimum conditions for enterprises, under which they 
could earn money. We laid down the following principle in the 
federal program for the modernization of metallurgy: 
Metallurgists expect to earn more than 90 percent of the 
necessary funds themselves. 
  [Smyk] Does this mean that metallurgists are fully satisfied 
with government activity? 
  [Afonin] For a start, let us discuss what we are not 
satisfied with. First, with the fact that the problem of 
nonpayments is being solved slowly; second, with the way rates 
of railroad transport and of electric power are being formed. 
The government must work out a system of measures so that the 
transport and energy components of the cost of products are not 
a burden on the entire economy. Third, naturally, taxes. We 
criticized our colleagues from the Ministry of Finance. During 
the formation of the budget it is incorrect to proceed from the 
principle: balance for the sake of balance. Furthermore, under 
crisis conditions the budget part should not be collected from 
enterprises by all conceivable and inconceivable extortions. As 
a result, the producer is left with funds, which often are not 
sufficient for the organization of simple reproduction, not to 
mention expanded reproduction. 
  [Smyk] As far as I know, at a recent economic conference in 
Lipetsk managers of the metallurgical complex worked out 
proposals for the government, including on tax policy. 
  [Afonin] They are now in the government, and I cannot say, 
in 
order to put them off indefinitely. At a meeting with managers 
of industrial and transport enterprises during the signing of 
the "Agreement on Accord" Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin said 
that the government saw the corrections, including in the tax 
system, which should motivate production growth. Apparently, 
however, the correction of tax policy will begin not earlier 
than next year.

<H5>  We Are Sinking, Not Having Traveled Even a Mile </H5>
  To: V.S. CHERNOMYRDIN, chairman of the Russian Federation 
Government 
  CC: RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA Editorial Department 
  YOUR DIRECTIVES CONCERNING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBTS FOR THE 
WORK PERFORMED IN 1993 AND DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1994 BY 
MINISTRIES OF FINANCE AND TRANSPORT ARE IGNORED. GOVERNMENT 
INACTION CONDEMNS FURTHER CONSTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR URAL 
ICEBREAKER AND PYETR VELIKIY CRUISER TO DEATH. IF YOUR 
ASSURANCES AND DIRECTIVES MEAN NOTHING TO MINISTERS, THEN 
RESIGN. A STRIKE COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED AT THE PLANT. 
  [Signed] V. FIRYULIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE TRADE-UNION COMMITTEE 
OF THE BALTIYSKIY PLANT JOINT-STOCK COMPANY 
  [Signed] N. CHALOV, CHAIRMAN OF THE STRIKE COMMITTEE 
<H5>  Will We Also Turn the Ural Icebreaker and the Pyetr Velikiy </H5>
Cruiser Into Scrap Metal?! 
  The Ural icebreaker and the Pyetr Velikiy cruiser are two 
most complex orders, for the execution of which the Baltiyskiy 
Plant is paid from the budget. To be more precise, it should be 
paid, since funds for the completion of Ural's construction were 
last received by the plant in November of last year and for the 
cruiser, only on Russian Federation First Deputy Defense 
Minister A. Kokoshin's personal order. 
  As we see, the alarm by the public organizations is 
well-founded. Even earlier the plant administration appealed to 
various authorities, including the president's administration 
and personally to V. Chernomyrdin. It seems that a compromise 
solution was found with N. Tsakh, chief of the Maritime Fleet 
Department of the Ministry of Transportation: In order to 
complete the construction of the icebreaker, the enterprise 
lowers profitability from 25 to 10 percent--one can say that it 
is ready to operate at a loss. It did not want to do half a job. 
While Ural's total cost is 169 million dollars, the completion 
of its construction requires 80 million dollars. (For your 
information: It is 50 percent cheaper than the icebreaker 
purchased by us from Finland). 
  "We found ourselves in an idiotic situation," Oleg 
Shulyanovskiy, president of the Baltiyskiy Plant Joint-Stock 
Company, says. "Instead of doing our work, we are forced to walk 
ministerial corridors. On 23 May we received a telegram from O. 
Soskovets that ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry 
of Transportation to pay the plant, according to the contract, 
R10 billion and to decide on the program to complete the ship's 
construction. However, we already have dozens of such telegrams. 
  "We would like to finally receive from the government a 
clear 
answer: To build or not to build? Does Russia need the Ural and 
the Pyetr Velikiy, or shall we turn them into scrap metal? It 
seems that it is not the first time that we astonish the entire 
world with mismanagement and helplessness."

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economic </F>
observer: "The President's Six Edicts"] 
  [Text] The president's edict "On Reform of State 
Enterprises" adopted by him at the beginning of the week evoked 
a contradictory reaction in the country. Liberal market 
advocates saw in it a step backward to the socialist 
authoritarian method of production management and communists, a 
change of the signboard not affecting the economic foundation of 
present Russia, while centrists viewed the document with guarded 
expectation. 
  We will recall that the edict provides for the transfer of 
most state enterprises not subject to privatization to 
government expense. The new status significantly limits the 
rights of production workers in the management of plants and 
factories. Without the consent of the government they can no 
longer establish subsidiary firms, lease out premises, and take 
credits. No matter what monetarists may say, such restrictions 
are fully justified. 
  As soon as a power declares that it intends to reserve for 
itself the right of an owner of a number of production 
structures, it would be totally unwise to stop controlling their 
activity, closing its eyes to the plundering of its property and 
to its passing to private individuals. 
  The part of the presidential edict that discusses the 
prohibition to reduce work places at state enterprises seems 
much more interesting and important. If we take into 
consideration that the change in status will affect primarily 
chronically (within the last two years) unprofitable plants, 
among which the lion's share belongs to the military-industrial 
complex (its privatization will be affected to the smallest 
degree), it becomes obvious: The authorities have finally 
realized the danger of mass bankruptcies and mass unemployment 
in the country. 
  Another thing is also obvious: The unprofitable military 
industry can be kept afloat only at the price of gigantic budget 
subsidies and the budget can be replenished only at the expense 
of profitable enterprises through an increase in the tax burden. 
Hence it follows that the president's and the government's 
intention to lower taxes by 10 to 20 percent, as promised in 
another presidential edict ("On Some Problems of Tax Policy"), 
is either an open bluff, or a sincere attempt to keep up with 
the second "rabbit," which will never be caught. 
  Well, something always has to be sacrificed. The chief thing 
is to see to it that this tax sacrifice is not in vain and that 
unprofitable enterprises do not drag with them to the bottom the 
ship of the Russian economy, which is sinking as it is.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Morozov, Tynda: "Rails to Yakutsk"] </F>
  [Text] The administration of the BAM [Baiykal-Amur 
Mainline] held a conference which was participated in by D. 
Trofimov, Minister for AYaM Affairs [Amur-Yakutsk Mainline] in 
the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia). They discussed 
questions of organizing the Yakutsk Department of the BAM. 
  A new department is going to appear on the BAM. At first it 
will be a section between Bestuzhevo and Neryungri. Later on it 
will have spur tracks added to it and, of course, sections of 
the AYaM, in particular the Neryungri-Aldan section. 
  Where is the department itself to be located? Without a lot 
of debate, the Yakutsk delegation decided in favor of Berkakit 
instead of the original intention to locate it in Neryungri, 
which already has a fairly well developed production and social 
infrastructure. 
  True, economic problems of the Berkakit hub are taking on 
new 
coloration. Because of the chronic shortage of funds, the hub 
has yet to reach its projected size, and when the department is 
created, urgent tasks will arise, including construction of a 
communications facility, the main locomotive depot, railcar 
facilities, and servicing facilities at the Neryungri Passenger 
Station. Housing will also be needed. Finally, for two years now 
the Berkakit station's industrial zone has lacked a reliable 
source of heat--a scaffold bridge needs to be built, but there 
are no funds; they have all been channeled into the completion 
of housing. 
  Participants stated that if we want to get a fully-fledged, 
effectively operating department we need to open a commercial 
station at Aldan, which means that a whole complex of work will 
have to be done on the right-of-way, in particular track work 
and, in addition, work on a permanent communications link, a 
power line and substations, not counting other infrastructure 
facilities. 
  Having decided to create the Yakutsk Department of the 
Railroad, participants had apparently set their priorities in 
the organization of the work of the construction units on the 
right-of-way. But how are the financial problems to be solved? 
  There were no specific answers to this question. But, first 
of all, Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin has signed a decree 
affirming the status of the socioeconomic development program of 
the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), in which the construction of the 
AYaM is given high priority. A special account has been opened 
in Yakutia to accumulate funds coming in from export and import 
duties (Russia's share in the completion of the AYaM). Second, 
measures have been taken to pay off debts to the construction 
workers. According to present data, the debt on the Berkakit hub 
has been reduced from 4.8 to 2.8 billion rubles, and on the main 
Berkakit-Tommot section it has been liquidated altogether. 
  Finally, the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) 
intends to allocate 80 billion rubles this year to complete the 
AYaM; moreover, Switzerland and Austria will be taking part in 
the financing for the first time. 
  But many problems still remain to be solved. We would like 
to 
know the amount of contributions for the development of the 
Berkakit hub (according to our information, they range between 
18 and six [as printed] billion rubles), also when the account 
can be used. Summer is short in the North, and if you let it 
slip by, many problems will remain unsolved. This places many 
obligations on the clients. 
  There are two clients, as we know. Participants in the 
conference once more affirmed the "division of spheres of 
influence" between the board of directors of the BAM project 
(responsible for the Berkakit hub) and the general board of the 
AYaM project (responsible for the main section of the road). 
There has not been any talk of a third client, although it is 
known that the Amur-Yakutsk Railroad Joint Stock Company is 
going to be one. 
  As for the first two, participants in the conference decided 
to set up a coordination center staffed by the chief engineers 
of the services of the BAM administration. The center's task is 
to inspect construction projects regularly and issue the 
appropriate recommendations, which the General Board for the 
AYaM project pledges to carry out. It is a complex system, of 
course, but what can you do when the government of the Sakha 
Republic has decided to keep the construction of the new 
railroad in its own hands. 
  It can be said that the organizational structure of the 
administration of the project has been decided. Optimists see 
this as a good sign, while pessimists are inclined to refrain 
from rejoicing--they know that the fairytale is finished 
quickly, but not the job. In the case of the AYaM, so far there 
is no reason to doubt the truth of that maxim.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Daniklin: "Profession? Killer. </F>
First They Are Hired for `Hit Jobs'; Then They Are Invariably 
`Eliminated' as Undesirable Witnesses"] 
  [Text] About seven years ago journalists using the English 
word "killer" had to explain what it meant in Russian. These 
days it is one of the most popular words in our newspapers. And 
here is why. According to the information of the MVD [Ministry 
of Internal Affairs], last year almost 30,000 people died at the 
hands of their own criminal compatriots. Among them were a 
large number who were murdered by contract. However, it is 
virtually impossible to cite the exact number of contract 
killings: Investigations into such crimes are difficult, and, 
indeed, no such concept yet exists in the criminal code. 
  A contract killing costs money, and a lot of it. It is rare 
for one vagrant to hire another to kill a third. More often it 
is business rivals who are killed. Or businessmen refusing to 
pay their dues. Or criminal kingpins from rival gangs. 
  According to the preliminary data of the Russian MVD Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime, last year a 
contract character was officially established to 237 murder 
cases. True, as far as exposing the criminals and bringing them 
to justice is concerned, results were more modest -- only 65 
murder cases were thus solved. In effect, Dmitriy Medvedev, 
chief of a department of this administration says, there are 
significantly more contract killings, but it is sometimes simply 
impossible to prove it. 
  Often a murder has all the hallmarks of a "contract job," 
but 
there were apparently no reasons for such a grave outcome for 
the victim. Professionals involved in investigating these 
terrible crimes confidently state that around 80 percent of 
those who fall within a killer's sights either themselves 
belonged to the criminal world formerly, or were in close 
contact with it. The remaining 20 percent were victims of their 
own intractability and refusal to pay their dues.... As a rule, 
the whole thing revolves around very large sums of money. 
  The tradition has arisen among respectable businessmen of 
surrounding themselves with bodyguards. As practice shows, this 
is no obstacle for a professional killer. All that happens is 
that collateral victims are added to the main target. The 
murder of the well-known St. Petersburg businessmen Vagin may 
serve as an illustration of this conclusion: In addition to 
Vagin himself, the militia found a further three corpses at the 
scene of the crime. Bodyguards. 
  The most sensational contract killing of recent times in 
Moscow was the murder of Otari Kvantrishvili. Neither a host of 
bodyguards, nor a colossal network of connections saved him from 
the fateful shot. The murderer has not been found to this day, 
and no serious breakthroughs in the investigation are evidently 
to be expected in the near future. Initially, one version was 
that the killer was not a professional -- the bullet was fired 
from a small caliber rifle ("Couldn't they get hold of a more 
reputable weapon?") Experienced officers from the Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime hold the opposite 
opinion: A small caliber rifle is the idle murder weapon, but 
only in the hands of a professional. When a shot is fired to 
the head, the bullet pierces one wall of the skull; it does not 
have the velocity to pierce the second, and begins to richochet 
wildly in the head, turning the brains to jelly. The success 
rate is 100 percent. 
  The investigations into the deaths of Nikolay Likhachev, 
chairman of the board of "Rosselkhozbank," Sergey Dubov, 
president of the "Novoye Vremya" publishing house, Valeriy 
Vlasov, director of "Valeriy's" casino, and many others, have 
all fallen flat. 
  In recent times (and extremely unexpectedly) yet another 
category of victims has emerged -- major gangland kingpins and 
godfathers. There is even talk that the MVD has set up a 
special hit squad. Colonel Medvedev's comment on these rumors 
was categorical: Rubbish! 
  As a class of professionals, hitmen have appeared in our 
society comparatively recently: Supply has arisen to meet the 
demand. Former heroes of the Afghan campaign, special purpose 
troops, separated KGB officers -- they have already been taught 
to kill professionally. Or to defend: A killer with the 
sobriquet Andron somehow fell into the hands of operatives. It 
turned out that he had previously served as a personal bodyguard 
to Boris Pugo, the former USSR interior minister. 
  Dmitriy Medvedev relates that the departments engaged in the 
battle with organized crime have not only tried to set up a data 
bank on "working" killers, but have even begun preventive work 
with those inclined to choose this profession. The Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime has already 
gathered information on 37 hitmen. This already represents a 
great deal of work -- after all, it takes the work of hundreds 
of officers to expose each one of these "figures." 
  Certain conclusions and generalizations have also been made. 
There are two categories in the professional hitmen's "guild" -- 
lone gunmen and squads. Neither are long-lived. A lone gunman 
who gives a poor account of himself is "rubbed out" by the 
contractors themselves after two or three jobs. In the squads, 
if the gunmen see one of their comrades on the brink of getting 
busted (if he lands up in the station, he will drop everyone in 
it), he is also "rubbed out" -- the collective survival instinct 
operates. 
  Sometimes you meet with "specialists" with several dozen 
corpses to their name -- they are highly valued and well paid in 
the criminal world; they even manage to occupy a certain niche 
in the criminal hierarchy. But in the end, even these are 
rubbed out: They know too much about too many people, and become 
dangerous. The case of one Bakulev from Izhevsk is extremely 
typical. He had more than 30 murders to his name. The militia 
followed his trail (more accurately, followed the corpses in his 
trail), but at the last moment, he mysteriously vanished. 
Finally Bakulev was found. Murdered. His own kind settled 
accounts with him. 
  Squads of hitmen are more of a problem -- you cannot wipe 
out 
the whole gang overnight. And if they fall into the hands of 
the militia, their friends on the outside do not spare money in 
hiring the best lawyers. 
  The "activity" of the squads usually has an itinerant 
character -- "first aid" in reverse. One such squad is now in a 
detention center; more detailed information about it cannot be 
given at the present time. 
  Everyone is always interested to know how much it costs to 
have somebody murdered. There are no hard-and-fast tariffs 
here. For instance, a gang of five hitmen in Kandalashka asked 
the extortionate price of 20 "lemons" [million rubles] for the 
murder of a prestigious person. And in Moscow there is 
information that hitmen get hundreds of thousands of dollars for 
prominent personalities. For conspiratorial reasons hitmen are 
frequently hired through third, fourth, and fifth persons, and 
these "contractors" and "subcontractors," as in any normal deal, 
also add on their "trade surcharge" -- as a result the price for 
fulfilling the contract increases appreciably. 
  Operatives who regularly take part in the investigation of 
such crimes note one detail: Today any weapon is put in the 
hand of the hired killer, even including weapons of which the 
American and European special services, for instance, have 
themselves only a single example in their arsenals. Neither 
cost nor transport across any borders is any object. 
  And although there are reports of contract killings almost 
every day, as far as is known, not one criminal case has been 
brought to court in which a well-known hitman has been in the 
dock. It just so happens that he does not live to face trial, 
even given robust health. And this is understandable: Who 
needs sensational exposures? Only the press. 
  This is how the analysts in militia uniform are inclined to 
assess the situation as regards contract killers today. But 
what about the state? What new rights has it given to the 
militia so that it can react properly to an attack by hired 
killers? Just imagine, the operational workers say: Is it 
possible to solve a murder and collect sufficient irrefutable 
evidence on a suspect within 72 hours of initial detention? 
What planet do our legislators live on, if they stubbornly 
refuse to recognize even the following fact: In just six years, 
murders have become eight times more frequent in our capital. 
  Anatoliy Yashkin, deputy chief of the Russian MVD Main 
Administration for Combating Organized Crime, admitted that 
law-enforcement organs have themselves probably been 
insufficiently forceful in their demands on legislators. And 
indeed: It is possible to institute criminal proceedings 
against a suspected hired killer, and even gather the necessary 
evidence. But as for getting to the client who hired his 
services... The practice of the best foreign law-enforcement 
systems testifies that it is possible to get somewhere only when 
the organizer of the murder receives a sterner penalty than the 
actual killer. There is no other way of fighting the mafia. 
But here people believe that there is and say: Hey, guys, 
don't be yellow. 
  But the guys are not yellow. They become hitmen -- the pay 
is good, and they are in the news every day.

<F P=106> [Article by Sergey Mikhalych: "In the Summer the Children </F>
Will Turn Our Country Into a Camp, but Certainly Not a Pioneer 
Camp: A Forecast"] 
  [Text] Judging from all appearances, this summer will be 
the equivalent of a natural disaster. It is not merely a matter 
of the weather or the migration of refugees who are creating 
bottlenecks and traffic-jams in all modes of transportation. It 
is a matter of crime, which--according to the data provided by 
the authoritative organs in this field--should increase 
significantly during the summer. And whereas the summertime 
growth of "adult" crime will--as anticipated--be the usual one, 
as in previous years, the situation with regard to crime among 
juveniles--according to the forecasts--must be considered 
disturbing and inauspicious. 
  In the first place, the children will be on vacation.... 
  Whereas previously the virtually en masse "Pioneerization" 
of 
children provided the police with a calm and tranquil life, this 
cannot be counted on nowadays. Camps are being closed down 
everywhere; in Moscow alone such an unenviable lot has befallen 
hundreds of children's institutions. They lack sufficient funds. 
Admissions tickets to those camps that are still afloat will 
cost R400,000-R600,000. 
  It is a rare parent that will be able to scrape up such a 
sum. Of course, the governments of Moscow and other Russian 
cities have allocated subsidies. And--judging by all 
appearances--50 percent of the cost of an admissions ticket will 
be paid by means of social insurance. Moreover, as we were 
informed in the Russian Ministry of Education, approximately 
R500 million have already been allotted from the federal budget 
for summer vacations. Allocation of an equal such sum was 
discussed yesterday at a session of the government. 
  But the forecasts of the criminologists are, nevertheless, 
quite disturbing inasmuch as even the funds that have been 
allocated are patently insufficient. In the opinion of the 
specialists, the principal trends in juvenile crime manifest 
themselves more clearly during the summer. Whereas the increase 
in crime as a whole during the last five years has amounted to 
50 percent, and--moreover--one out of every six crimes committed 
by juveniles is serious (robbery, theft, larceny), during the 
summer the increase in crime will amount to approximately 60 
percent over last year's figure. In the main, these will be 
extremely diverse types of larceny--ranging from the activities 
of pickpockets to those of shoplifters. There will be more 
street-type hooliganism and squabbles between gangs. 
  Statistics show that last year the number of crimes 
committed 
by juveniles while in a state of intoxication increased by 
approximately 70 percent. Moreover, it has been officially 
acknowledged that throughout the country as a whole there are 
about 100,000 underage drunkards, and that--generally 
speaking--one youth in three who has reached the age of 14 
drinks on a regular basis. 
  St. Petersburg and Moscow will be affected worst of all by 
the above-mentioned problem. Crowds of migrating homeless 
children will rush to these cities in order to live from hand to 
mouth. Some 20,000 "drifters" will be added to the 60,000 St. 
Petersburg gamins and the 40,000 already in Moscow. Rough 
computations show that in the winter the number of Russia's 
homeless varies from 150,000 to 180,000; but in the summer, 
because of seasonal homelessness, there will be approximately 
250,000-300,000 of them. 
  And the Law on Education merely adds to the trouble. Through 
its inadvertence--according to data provided by Deputy Prime 
Minister Yu. Yarov--there will be about half a million juveniles 
on the streets; these are kids who have been expelled from the 
system of secondary education. Because nowadays each school is 
free to accept or reject anyone at its own discretion. And this 
is not in conflict with the Constitution inasmuch as the latter 
has guaranteed only a mandatory incomplete secondary education. 
Taking into consideration the complex difficulties of job 
placement and the reduction in the number of 
vocational-technical schools, most of these 600,000 juveniles 
will simply waste their time in idleness, or else terrorize the 
neighborhoods and surrounding areas.

<F P=106> Article by Ye. Kalinicheva: "Only Mountain Summits Are More </F>
Abrupt Than the Head of the City of Moscow"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  A. Chubays Versus Yu. Luzhkov </H5>
  A modest press conference held by Anatoliy Chubays took 
place 
on Friday evening, 27 May, and was devoted to his differences 
with Yuriy Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow, concerning 
privatization. By the way, that press conference extended 
clearly beyond the framework of that issue. The discussion 
concerned the fact that a new comet with a tail appeared in the 
Russian firmament and it is impossible to know what to expect of 
it. Chubays characterized the actions of the mayor of Moscow as 
a game not played by the rules. 
  The chairman of the State Committee for the Administration 
of 
State Property declared that also in the past the well-financed 
propaganda shows of the Moscow city chief, aimed against 
progressive market reforms, appeared indecent for a man 
declaring himself to be a fervent supporter of the president. 
Now the situation has gone completely out of control and is 
becoming catastrophic. Chubays directed the attention of the 
journalists to the fact that every new step by the president and 
the government aimed at deepening the reforms met with 
opposition from the mayor of Moscow. The glory of a hero of the 
October events and defender of democracy apparently introduced 
new colors in the bright image of Luzhkov and granted him new 
rights. Luzhkov believes that he has the right to correct laws, 
presidential edicts, and government decrees. In that manner he 
essentially halted the privatization of real property in Moscow, 
and blocked the inclusion of land in the overall privatization 
program. With a slight time shift after the presidential edicts 
Yuriy Luzhkov proclaimed his decisions, which totally negated 
presidential decisions. 
  The latest example of Luzhkov's independence is the 
antiprivatization constitution, as Chubays called the Moscow 
privatization program, and stressed that it is merely a 
selection of unparalleled opportunities for arbitrary action by 
officials in the capital. That was how Chubays put it and one 
cannot deny him his eloquence. 
  Luzhkov, however, is no fool either. His actions it would 
appear have an economic underpinning as well. For example he 
announced that he could obtain one trillion rubles from Moscow 
privatization, while the entire privatization campaign itself, 
according to estimates by the Committee for the Administration 
of State Property, is expected to yield a revenue of one 
trillion rubles for the treasury. Moreover, Moscow authorities 
reached the conclusion that privatized enterprises have economic 
indices inferior to those of state enterprises. Studies by 
sociologists hired by Luzhkov's people indicated that only six 
out of a 1,000 directors of privatized enterprises can perform 
the functions that were formerly handled by the ministries. 
Luzhkov plans close alliances with producers. The alliance with 
ZIL, with AZLK [Moscow Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant], and 
with other Moscow giants can serve as an example of that. 
  Chubays rejected these assertions at the press conference. 
Results of market research conducted by the State Committee for 
the Administration of State Property indicated that the overall 
investment demand in the country comes to 2.6 trillion [currency 
not specified]. Half of these funds will go to the already 
privatized enterprises. Only 15-20 percent will go into the 
federal budget. 
  Society, yet another time, can see that figures argue with 
each other just like people do. They are prejudiced and, 
unfortunately, cannot serve as criteria of the truth. 
  Against the overall behavioral background of the city chief, 
the fact that Luzhkov simply prohibited the registration of 
joint-stock companies in Moscow appears to be a minor matter. By 
April the Moscow State Committee for the Administration of State 
Property blocked the privatization of all state property within 
their jurisdiction. Privatization in Moscow is carried out only 
with the permission of federal authorities. Luzhkov received 
good support from the Russian Federation Committee on Land 
Resources and Land Management and an extensive Moscow 
officialdom that certainly does not wish to live under rules 
written by another hand. The power of Moscow officialdom is 
greater than the power of law. 
  According to Anatoliy Chubays a social explosion may occur 
in 
Moscow, the responsibility for which will rest squarely on the 
conscience of Yuriy Luzhkov. 
  By the way, Anatoliy Chubays did not limit himself to the 
press conference, but also wrote a letter to Chernomyrdin, the 
prime minister, and to President Yeltsin describing his position 
with regard to Luzhkov. According to Chubays the letter to the 
premier was well received and Luzhkov was given three days to 
make corrections. Chubays, however, according to his statement, 
also sent a letter to the procurator general of the Russian 
Federation demanding that order be established and lawlessness 
eliminated in Moscow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lidiya Kostrova, chairman of the Board of </F>
Radiotekhbank for the city of Nizhniy Novgorod by Vladimir 
Noskov, RT correspondent: "Intelligent Bank Transactions. The 
Nizhegorod Way"] 
  [Text] Lidiya Kostrova is a professional banker. She 
is married and has a school-age daughter. Since 1990 she has 
been the chairman of the Board of Radiotekhbank for the city of 
Nizhniy Novgorod. Vladimir Noskov, our correspondent, interviews 
her. 
  [Noskov] Lidiya Aleksandrovna, there are almost three dozen 
commercial banks in operation in Nizhniy Novgorod today. Tell us 
please, in what way does Radiotekhbank differ from all the rest? 
  [Kostrova] It certainly is different. After all, as far back 
as its creation in 1990, we set ourselves this task: our bank 
should engage primarily in extending credit to industrial 
enterprises. As we know, territorially we are in the Oka region, 
and it is here that the so-called "defense factories" are 
located. Just imagine the position these industrial enterprises 
would be in if it were not for our bank. 
  The point is, the investments in all the enterprises of the 
defense complex used to come totally from the state treasury. 
Now their products are of no use to anyone. More precisely, 
quite a few customers could be found, I am sure of it. But 
foreign ones. Our state has begun to consume less of the output 
of the military plants, but they are not permitted to trade in 
them directly. As a result, the "defense factories" have found 
themselves in genuine time-trouble. 
  There are quite a few of these plants in Russia today, and 
they have either totally shut down or are operating on a reduced 
schedule. There is not a single enterprise in our region which, 
as it were, has stood or been on the brink of closing, because 
the enterprise comes to our bank at a time of crisis and obtains 
preferential credit. 
  [Noskov] If it is not a trade secret, tell us the interest 
rate at which you give money? 
  [Kostrova] It is not a secret. We issue credit at 30 percent 
annually. I am sure that not a single bank, not only in our 
city, but in all of Russia, has a rate like this. Just bear in 
mind that we offer preferential credit to enterprises and 
organizations which are the founders of our bank. There are 
about 200 of them today. 
  [Noskov] Pardon me, but I must ask you: then how does your 
bank survive? After all, if you give credit at such low 
interest, this means that the bank has no revenue at all? 
  [Kostrova] On the contrary, our bank is one of the thriving 
ones in the city. The expert evaluation of the workers in the 
Central Bank of Russia attests to this. 
  The revenue is not, however, formed only from receiving 
interest on the credit extended to enterprises and 
organizations. After all, our bank also engages in other types 
of activity. For example, it attracts the funds of legal and 
physical persons into deposits, conducts an accounting service 
for its customers, transfers money for very short terms, 
performs legal and economic consultation, etc. And, of course, 
we render various services to the people of our city. We have 
also begun to do this through our branches in Kirzhach, Arzamas 
and Valakhna. 
  [Noskov] Does this mean that your borrowers may be not only 
enterprises, but also ordinary citizens? 
  [Kostrova] Unfortunately, it is not quite this way. There 
are, of course, so-called financial persons among our founders. 
They account for less than five percent of the bank's charter 
capital, however. 
  The main shareholders, though, are the enterprises of the 
defense complex, which play a leading role in the economics, not 
only of the Volga-Vyatsk region, but also on a Russia-wide 
scale. The conversion measures being carried out by these 
enterprises and the cutback in state orders make additional 
investments necessary. These enterprises, having found 
themselves without the support of the departments and the 
government, and having worked out unique programs for conversion 
and business plans, are experiencing a sharp lack of internal 
funds to carry them out. The main direction, therefore, was and 
remains extending credit to the conversion programs which, as a 
rule, require long-term investments. 
  By decision of the bank's board, a so-called credit line was 
opened for these enterprises. The Nizhegorod Television Plant 
was the first to make use of this. Having obtained credit from 
us, it efficiently put money into re-equipping its production 
facility. In a very short time it began to produce fourth 
generation color television sets of the Chayka brand, sound 
recording video players, woodworking machine tools, tea and 
coffee pots and telephone equipment. 
  The bank makes credit investments calculated to bring a 
rapid 
return, not only when fulfilling conversion programs. Last year, 
for example, we gave loans to other vitally important sectors of 
the national economy, which are, under the conditions of the 
radical transformations taking place in the country's economy, 
experiencing a serious financial crisis. These are enterprises 
in procuring and processing agricultural products, kolkhozes and 
the pharmaceutical industry. 
  [Noskov] Under the conditions of the industrial enterprises' 
lack of money, however, is there not a danger that the bank will 
not recover the credit issued in the period established? 
  [Kostrova] Unfortunately, this danger is becoming a reality. 
The production slump in industry increases daily. This situation 
is very alarming. After all, how could we not sympathize with 
the industrial workers, when for us the interests of all the 
bank founders are of paramount importance. They must hope that 
the bank workers, its specialists, will not permit our other 
clients to suffer because of the insolvency of one of the 
borrowers. 
  On the basis of these considerations, and in view of the 
fact 
that the process of privatizing securities is being developed, 
the bank's potentials for ensuring the repayment of the loans 
are expanding. We have begun to introduce various types of bank 
credit into our practical work: promissory notes, overdrafts, 
credit for a current account, etc. 
  [Noskov] What services do you render rank-and-file citizens? 
  [Kostrova] Just like other commercial banks, we are working 
with the investments of the people. In addition, we are dealers 
for many investment funds, the shares of which any person may 
acquire from us, with no problems. Incidentally, before 1 June, 
vouchers can be exchanged for them at our bank.

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Svetlanova: "We Eat and Drink Any Old </F>
Thing and Sometimes -- We Poison Ourselves: Is the Law on 
Protection of Consumers' Rights in Russia Really in Force?"] 
  [Text] It is no secret: in the last three or four 
years the quality level of domestic products has fallen. Boris 
Migachev, general director of the Russian Testing and 
Certification Center, has stated this repeatedly. 
  It is a paradox: 57 certification organizations and 152 
testing laboratories are fighting over the important task of 
making our products meet safety and medical-biological norms. 
Moreover, this struggle is not without its banner. In fact, 
there is, after all, a Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights. 
  Almost 90 percent of the foodstuffs and 70 percent of 
industrial products are certified. It is a bit worse with 
imported goods: in 1993, Rostest rejected... one percent of the 
goods. And in general not because the rest were "okay." 
  Is satisfaction too expensive?.... It turns out that the 
price of a certificate issued by Rostest at the request of 
enterprises for a food product "stretches" to 80,000 rubles [R]. 
This includes the cost of tests and services upon conclusion of 
the expert examination. 
  Meanwhile, is the consumer chewing up unfit cheese and 
washing it down with unfit milk? The quality of the products 
supplied from many CIS countries is very bad. As Migachev 
stated, however, "beginning on 1 July, barriers will be set up." 
  It is curious: throughout Russia... there is no figure on 
rejected goods. Even though the consumer tested on his own skin 
(and repeatedly) the carelessness of the suppliers. ZIL, for 
instance -- it produced a microwave oven, which Rostest 
immediately rejected. The Krugozor Toy Factory was reprimanded 
for violation of the production process. Some products of the 
Mikoyanov Meat Combine and the Cherkizovo Dairy Combine were 
rejected. 
  Forty Western firms have now turned to Rostest with a 
request 
to certify their products. Eighteen German washing machines are 
being tested. Let us hope that Moscow has every opportunity of 
testing products. One thing is particularly depressing: The 
hawkers and kiosk attendants "pass around" quite a few fake 
certificates. The general director of Rostest therefore appeals 
to us to be on the alert. If you don't want them to cheat you -- 
ask for a certificate. Not just any one. Be sure that the form 
has the seal and logo of the Rostest representative on it.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Peremyshlev: "What the Coming Year Has in </F>
Store for Us" 
  [Text] The annual general meeting of stockholders of 
Zheldorremmash AO [joint-stock company] has been held. As is 
customary, they tallied the results of the past year and mapped 
plans for the future. The figures are more or less clear: in the 
dry terms of the report, the labor collectives, despite working 
under extraordinarily difficult conditions, generally managed to 
accomplish the tasks of repairing the rolling stock of Russia's 
railroads and manufacturing spare parts, and they basically met 
their contractual obligations. At the same time, the total 
volume of commercial output by the AO's enterprises declined by 
almost 10 percent last year compared with 1992. In the first 
quarter of this year, the decline reached 22.5 percent. 
  Things will be harder in the future, which, as we know, has 
to be built on the foundations of today. And in many plants, it 
is not bright. Naturally, nonpayments are killing everyone. 
Right now the railroads owe the plants 145 billion rubles, which 
is more than their output for two months' work. And that in turn 
means the inability to acquire circulating capital and failure 
to pay personnel on time. In some plants, payments haven't even 
been made for March. It's a familiar picture. 
  Immoderate tax burdens are keeping the plants on their 
knees: 
91 out of every 100 rubles earned go to the budget, either 
federal or local. And, as one of the speakers said unhappily, 
you can't settle accounts with the budget with metal, or timber, 
or even Zhiguli cars. Only money. The kind of real money which 
there is not enough of to pay wages and buy circulating capital 
with. 
  The plants haven't been able to keep up with their bank 
loans. Last year, debts accumulated in the amount of 141 billion 
rubles, for which the banks are skinning the enterprises alive 
in the form of terrific interest rates. 
  This mournful list of things which are falling apart and the 
plants cannot afford could be prolonged indefinitely. They 
cannot undertake serious rebuilding of the enterprises, which 
stand there like architectural monuments in their primitive, 
unsightly form--some of them like the Ufa Locomotive Repair 
Plant, which was built in the last century, in 1888. The only 
things being rebuilt are those which are absolutely essential in 
doing repair work. 
  Under these circumstances, the conception that was to be 
submitted--namely, work without reducing volumes or the number 
of personnel--could not stand the test. Harsh reality dictates 
that the only means of salvation is to bring the number of 
personnel into line with dwindling volumes. If this isn't done, 
the directors' laments that the plants are going to "expire" or 
"shut down" will come true. 
  But here's the striking thing: some of the speakers 
asked--demanded--that the Ministry of Railways and the officers 
of the AO provide investment and firm targets along with no less 
firm financial support, and much else; others, fewer in number, 
seemed to be embarrassed and said that they didn't feel right 
complaining, that things were not as bad for them as for their 
colleagues. By mastering the production of new products--tank 
cars, for example--the Roslavl and Saransk plants have improved 
their financial position. The Chita people have started 
manufacturing fire engines and want to adapt some of them for 
use in the North, which, undoubtedly, will boost demand. An 
engine with a redesigned gimbal drive and a tank with a 
zinc-plated interior turned out to be better than the one 
manufactured in the Ukrainian city of Priluki. Railroad fire 
fighters are also interested in the engines. But the plant 
director acts like a proper merchant: there's money ahead. And 
he's confident it will come. 
  In particular, people are buying not only fire engines but 
also purely railroad-related goods and services--repairs to 
electric train sections, electrical machinery, and locomotive 
wheelsets. However, it is these products--wheelsets, for 
example--that some plants are behind in: the Michurinsk Plant 
(46 sets), Novosibirsk (20), and Ulan-Ude (225). And the 
Transbaykal Railroad needs 200 wheelsets right now. At the 
Moscow hub alone, 300 electric railcars stand idle: some of them 
lack motors, others lack compressors, still others lack 
wheelsets. Only about half of the repair needs of the country's 
motorized car rolling stock are being met. 
  You have to agree with the arguments of Deputy Minister A. 
Kondratenko, who said that no one is buying electric locomotives 
or diesel locomotives, but they will buy electric trains. And 
there is equal demand for repairs to them. Therefore, repair 
technologies have to be, if not flexible, at least "soft" in 
order to meet demand more easily. 
  Many people viewed declining shipments as nothing more than 
a 
summer rain--hey, it'll pass. And we can maintain our capacity 
and cadres. As soon as the sun peeks through, they said, the 
freight will surge again, repairs will be needed more frequently 
and in greater numbers, and we'll be right here with our sleeves 
rolled up. But it is obvious to everyone today that these 
calculations are not coming true. This would seem to be a time 
for showing initiative and sound entrepreneurship, but 
apparently not. They got their knuckles rapped for showing 
initiative. 
  One and a half or two years ago, people at the top kept 
close 
track of the kind of subsidiary work--now it was called 
auxiliary work--that the enterprises were engaged in, for fear 
it would take them away from their main job of repairing rolling 
stock for the sector. Now the leash has been loosened. But it is 
still well remembered by those who hold the leash and those who 
were led by it. This accounts for some people's excessive faith 
that the leader knows where he's going and that he will take 
care of the one he's leading, supplying him with orders, 
financing, and the rest. The leader would like to remain the 
leader, and sometimes, out of habit, tugs on the leash. But his 
powers are no longer what they used to be. 
  The AO's administration is still doing a lot for the plants, 
finding work for many of them and steering them to demand. It 
has worked out 40 programs, essentially long-term trends in the 
work of the repair sector. At the suggestion of the concern's 
management, the Novosibirsk Electric Locomotive Repair Plant in 
April repaired the first ChS series electric locomotives, and 
the Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg plants are starting to repair 
them; at the Velikiye Luki Locomotive Repair Plant they're 
starting to repair electric trains and manufacture cement and 
grain carriers. There is a very solid program underway to 
manufacture spare parts for foreign-made equipment in Russian 
enterprises and master the latest technologies. 
  Lots of good and interesting things are being done in 
Zheldorremmash. But the question now is how to keep the plants 
operational and geared to the actual needs of the sector, how to 
protect them against bankruptcy and, at the same time, not let 
them fall by the wayside. There are plenty of people today who 
want to invest capital in a smoothly-running, high-tech industry. 
  In order to prevent misunderstandings to the effect that the 
management of the sector, say, only cares about the railroads 
and treats the plants as stepchildren, in our opinion, firm and 
honest rules of the game are needed: the Center accepts exactly 
as many orders as it can supply with equipment, repairs, and 
financing. And it makes this known in advance, however difficult 
this may be under present circumstances. Otherwise, the plant is 
free to find its own sources--that is, orders. And if something 
unforeseen should happen tomorrow, so that plans have to be 
cancelled, it should pay in full for the violation. And under 
this arrangement, the plants won't have to wait for whatever 
from the management--everything will be stipulated. 
  Does this variant guarantee that the plant will not, sooner 
or later, slip out from under the sector's wing? Of course not. 
But it will be clear, at least, who is to blame. But the plants 
aren't going to go their own way: everyone needs an organizing 
and coordinating center (and the AO's management is taking a 
liking to the new relations, built on marketing, scientific 
research, and financial substantiation of decisions). Especially 
a competent center. It's no wonder that the meeting was attended 
by representatives from plants in practically all the republics 
of the former USSR, many of whom never gave a thought to 
breaking ties with the concern, which is now the Zheldorremmash 
AO. And they want to become full-fledged participants. Because 
they have found out for themselves what it's like to be off by 
yourself alone. 
  Candidate of Historical Sciences I. Yanin once wrote (see 
GUDOK, 30 October 1993) that "the interaction between the state 
and our sector as a unified, centralized state structure or 
corporation, is highly instructive and, if you please, has 
macroeconomic importance. The appropriate conclusions need to be 
drawn." 
  Why not, then, make use of this productive thinking--without 
arguing in favor of centralism, to be sure. After all, 
state-and-sector, sector-and-association, and 
association-and-enterprise constitute pairs that essentially 
resemble a matryoshka doll: one fits inside the other, and they 
basically duplicate one another. Successful entry into the 
market on the level of the plants vis-a-vis the Zheldorremmash 
AO will also be instructive for larger "matryoshka dolls," up to 
and including the state level that covers all the rest. 
  Let us hope that recent edicts by the President of Russia, 
in 
particular the one regulating the tax situation, reducing profit 
taxes on added value, will provide the sector's plants with an 
extra dose of oxygen and, in this way, make it easier for them 
to adapt to the new economic reality.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Security Council Deputy Secretary Vladimir </F>
Rubanov: "Militia and Special Forces Increase by 52,000 Men. 
Security Council Deputy Secretary Vladimir Rubanov Comments on 
the President's Edict `On Urgent Measures for the Implementation 
of the Russian Federation Federal Program To Reinforce the Fight 
Against Crime for 1994-1995'"] 
  [Text] The edict ratifies the Federal Program for the Fight 
Against Crime and determines measures to implement it, and this 
is possibly the most important thing in the document. In 
itself, the edict, which was adopted at the level of the highest 
Russian executive power, determines the status of the federal 
program. 
  Furthermore, it is important that the edict solves a 
financial problem. At the same time, specific instructions are 
being given to the government and responsibility for 
implementation is placed upon ministries and departments. And 
it must not be forgotten that this is an instruction from the 
president. 
  It is also important that the Security Council -- one of the 
initiators and elaborators of the program -- is the structure 
which is effecting the implementation of the program. Despite 
the fact that the implementation of the program is calculated to 
take two years, specific measures to fight crime by means of 
what are known as organizational actions are already being 
outlined now. Furthermore, the program is a federal one and 
settles problems at federal level. But this does not mean that 
the organs of local authority should sit and wait for the 
results of its implementation. 
  The president's edict provides a possibility of adopting 
regional programs for the fight against crime, taking into 
consideration criminal factors which occur in a particular 
region. Every component of the Federation has the possibility to 
reinforce measures aimed at the fight against crime at their own 
level and using their own resources. And the program shows how 
this can be done. 
  Apart from the set of legislative acts adopted at State Duma 
level, the edict stipulates the adoption of measures at 
government level too. That is, questions of child neglect and 
crimes committed by minors can already be settled at the level 
of existing legislation. 
  The edict makes it possible to maneuver the manpower and 
resources at the disposal of the executive organs of power, and 
settle a number of problems concerning the improvement of the 
material-technical conditions of the activity of the law 
enforcement organs and other structures involved in the fight 
against crime. 
  Apart from that, these measures may be adopted in a 
practical 
and efficient way before legislative initiatives appear. And in 
this case, it is a question of involving citizens, the public, 
in the fight against crime -- in the formation of subunits which 
used to be called the people's patrol. The Foreign Ministry has 
been called upon to deal with the problems of the uncontrolled 
migration of the population, which has become more complex in 
recent years. The Foreign Ministry is to reinforce monitoring of 
these processes. 
  The edict changes the situation which prevails in 
judicial-expert institutions, which are currently in a terrible 
state and are equal to academic scientific institutes in terms 
of payment. At the same time they work hand in hand with 
specialists from the "power" structures, which are in a 
different situation. All this could not fail to affect the 
cadres of these institutions: Specialists have moved to other 
structures of law enforcement organs or left altogether. The 
loss of specialists of that class could not fail to have an 
effect on the work of the law enforcement organs. This question 
has been resolved by the edict. 
  A number of measures still require legalization by 
legislation. Thus, forgery is currently rife. This has 
basically occurred because of the emergence of color 
photocopiers. The edict envisages the strict monitoring of this 
type of duplicating machinery. 
  Ministries and departments were instructed to prepare a 
number of legislative acts to be published in this federal 
program. In particular, instructions were also given on the 
questions on which the organs of internal affairs themselves 
deemed it necessary to make amendments to existing legislation. 
They have drawn up their proposals, which have been reflected 
in the edict. The president's edict also makes it possible for 
appeals to be made to the legislative power in a legally correct 
form to legalize the rights which the organs of internal affairs 
need in order to intensify the fight against crime. 
  The fact that the subunits and special troops involved in 
the 
fight against crime have increased by 52,000 men should be noted 
as an important thing in the edict. As we know, the Army is 
only used to repel an enemy, but we also know that a lot of 
situations have arisen in the past few years and are still 
arising when military support and special troops are needed. 
  The edict also envisages measures to strengthen security at 
ports, stations, and airports. Special subunits are now being 
created which will accompany trains, both on suburban and 
interurban routes; this has been brought about by the increasing 
danger on railroads. The customs services have not been 
forgotten either. Within the framework of the conversion 
program, installations, military camps, and resources (which do 
not require a burden on the budget) which are being freed up by 
military units are being transferred to the structures involved 
in the fight against crime. These are just some of the 
important aspects which it will be possible to settle thanks to 
the issuing of this edict.

<F P=106> [Marina Lebedeva report: "Refugee Problem Being Solved, But </F>
They Will Have To Suffer for a Long Time Yet"] 
  [Text] There are over half a million refugees registered 
in Russia. It is expected that in the next few years the number 
of migrants could exceed 6 million. Will Russia be able to give 
them the necessary economic aid and moral support? 
  Today the reality is such that refugees are in a parlous 
situation. For example, 6,000 people who suffered during the 
events in Sumgait and Baku have been temporarily accommodated in 
boardinghouses, hostels, and hotels in Moscow and Moscow Oblast 
for five years now. They are now threatened with eviction onto 
the street. The joint-stock companies which have become the 
buildings' owners have applied for court orders. Court rulings 
have already been made on some applications. Other refugees 
expect the same fate without any hope of defense. 
  This was discussed at a news conference at the 
Russian-American Press Center. 
  For five years Moscow has been paying for refugees to live 
in 
hotels, and at current prices this is a fantastic amount of 
money. But it turns out that the only alternative to this is 
evicting people from the city. Apartments are found for 
arriving workers under the quota system, for errant former first 
secretaries of some krays and oblasts, and for former people's 
deputies of the Soviet Union for whom the people simply cannot 
nurture warm feelings, but there is only one sentence for 
refugees -- eviction. On 18 May at Odintsovskiy Rayon Court in 
Moscow Oblast it was decided to evict the Bagdasarov family -- 
consisting of a woman who has undergone a serious operation and 
her two daughters. The same fate was suffered by the Smirnov 
family from Kaliningrad near Moscow. The court decreed: 
eviction without alternative housing. 
  Actions to evict refugees without giving them alternative 
housing are a violation of human rights, the Russian Federation 
Constitution, and international acts signed by Russia, the 
conference participants noted. The Moscow and Federal Migration 
Services, which are supposed to safeguard refugees' interests, 
are siding with those who are evicting them and are submitting 
to the courts evidence of refugees' refusal to travel to some 
other regions. But at the conference the refugees produced a 
whole file of documents -- refusals to accept them in the cities 
and villages to which the Migration Service had sent them. 
Meanwhile the Moscow Government, which has many of its own 
unsolved problems, including a waiting list of thousands of 
Muscovite families needing housing, is taking its own measures 
to get rid of the refugees. Specifically, the opinion is being 
circulated that Moscow is full of refugees who are creating a 
criminogenic situation in the city. But, as was noted at the 
conference, this information is clearly an exaggeration. 
According to Ministry of Internal Affairs data the resettlement 
of refugees in Moscow is 2.2 times less than throughout the 
country as a whole. Nevertheless, confrontation between the 
refugees and the Moscow authorities is intensifying, and not in 
favor of the refugees. 
  Against the background of such a sorry picture the 
appearance 
in Russia of refugees capable of defending themselves in some 
way arouses special interest. 
  On 2 June the first congress of organizations and 
enterprises 
of refugees and displaced persons opens in Moscow. It is being 
held by Russia's "Compatriots" foundation. 
  Prudently excluding the capital and its oblast from its 
field 
of activity, the foundation has for several years been helping 
to create compact refugee settlements and provide work for them 
in other Russian regions. The "Compatriots" foundation now 
comprises 700 small resettlement enterprises and 32 branches in 
which refugees and settlers work as well. The foundation gives 
interest-free credit over five to seven years to those prepared 
to engage in enterprise for themselves. They themselves must 
earn money for housing. And the refugees do earn it. In 
Belgorod Oblast they assembled and sold 43 buses, and with the 
money earned they constructed 19 cottages. In Lipetsk they 
produce nails, in Pereslavl-Zalesskiy they produce ceramic 
crockery. 
  Foundation President Boris Sergeyev believes that the most 
important thing for the refugees is to integrate themselves and 
not to be parasites. This is why, the foundation's president 
explained, refugees make up no more than 51 percent of the work 
force at their enterprises, the remainder being locals. As far 
as I understood Sergeyev, the regions must realize that the 
"bundle of belongings is not the only thing a refugee brings 
with him to his new country of residence: Einstein was a 
refugee." This is precisely the inscription on one of the 
posters of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

<F P=106> [Olga Akulova report: "Are We Going To Live Better?"] </F>
  [Text] The third all-Russia seminar-conference on the 
"Experience and Future Prospects of the Exercise of Powers by 
the Russian Federation Components in the Interests of the 
Regions' Social Development" has taken place under the auspices 
of the Russian Federation Government. 
  The resolution of social questions depends directly on the 
state of the economy. While the fall in production, mutual 
nonpayments, and delays in paying wages and pensions continue, 
the situation in the social sphere will remain tense. However, 
positive changes have also been noted recently. First of all, 
as Russian Federation Minister of Labor G.G. Melikyan noted at 
the conference, inflation rates have successfully been brought 
down: In recent months they were 20-30 percent, but in April 6 
percent. Some rise in the population's standard of living has 
been noted: Last year prices increased by a factor of 7.5 and 
incomes by a factor of 8.5. Within outgoings the proportion 
taken up by food is not increasing, meaning that people have 
stopped spending all their money on produce and have begun to 
acquire some material goods as well. Restrictions on demand have 
begun to take effect, the market is filling up, and trade stocks 
have increased by one-third. All this is encouraging -- prices 
will not increase. But, as many of the conference's 
participants said, the important thing is that there has been a 
structural advance, from the industrial to the social level. 
Questions of the provision of essential needs are becoming a 
priority. 
  In spite of the difficulties involved in financing social 
programs, all possible measures are being taken in the regions 
to support the most vulnerable groups in society -- pensioners, 
large families and families with absent parents, invalids, and 
persons unable to withstand economic difficulties on their own. 
  The regional administrative organs' influence over the 
implementation of social policy has increased. Many oblasts 
have developed and are implementing their own programs for the 
social protection of the population. In the Komi Republic three 
programs -- "Childhood," "Health," and "Care" -- are being 
successfully implemented. In Ulyanovsk Oblast non-production 
construction projects are being carried out vigorously -- 19 
schools have been built, many kilometers of asphalt roads have 
been laid, and many villages have been provided with water 
supplies. The oblast has succeded in becoming completely 
self-sufficient in sugar, vegetable oil, and potatoes, which 
will make it possible to curb price increases. 
  The conference participants analyzed the experience of 
organs 
of executive power in the provinces -- for this the speakers 
presented interesting information and also discussed the 
difficulties and problems involved in implementing state social 
guarantees. It was decided to place the emphasis in this work 
on the regions on the condition that there is serious support at 
the federal level. 
  Yu.F. Yarov, deputy chairman of the Russian Federation 
Government, L.F. Bezlepkina, minister of social protection, V.V. 
Barchuk, chairman of the Russian Pension Fund, Ye.F. Lakhova, 
chairman of the Russian Federation President's Commission on 
Questions of Women, the Family, and Demography, and leaders of 
departments ensuring that social policy is carried out in this 
country participated in the conference's work.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Kucherenko report: "To Stop the Mice Getting Out </F>
of Hand a Cat Has Been Brought Into the House -- But It Is Tied 
Up by the Tail"] 
  [Text] Until recently our bankers had been completely 
protected from foreign competition. But the Russian Federation 
presidential edict that is under preparation on the admission of 
foreign financiers and the regulation of this process will bring 
this protectionism to an end. 
  There have long been arguments over this. V. Gerashchenko, 
head of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, has 
particularly campaigned for foreigners to be admitted. His 
arguments are that without strong competitors our commercial 
banks have monopolized the financial services market and are 
making no effort to lower their lending rates or commissions, 
while not improving their quality or the skills of their staff. 
Earning inflated monopoly profits, they are paying themselves 
fantastic salaries, living it up, and spending crazy amounts of 
money on politics and the mass media rather than on the economy. 
This is why the Central Bank recently proposed admitting a 
limited number of foreign banks with weighty reputations. But 
their capital will be limited to one-tenth of the capital of our 
banks. Figuratively speaking, we will be letting a cat into the 
house to educate the mice, but we will be tying it up by the 
tail as a precaution. 
  Naturally, this move has been opposed by Russian bankers 
themselves, who are scared of losing their best clients. They 
have been supported by former Finance Minister B. Fedorov. He 
admitted that, of the 2,000 commercial banks in this country (as 
of December 1993), only one-tenth have financially trained 
staff. And he noted that foreigners can afford to work at cost 
in order to gain market share and grab the market for deposits 
-- since people will trust the foreign banks' reliability more 
than our own financiers' persistent advertising. It is no 
accident, they claim, that countries like Finland and Japan had 
until recently not allowed foreign rival bankers access to their 
market. 
  The question of "whether to let them in or not" has recently 
become a political one. In late 1992/early 1993 the Supreme 
Soviet came to the defense of the Russian banks' monopoly by 
attempting to bring in a three-year moratorium on the admission 
of foreigners. At the time Gerashchenko had protection from 
Yeltsin, who blocked the law. But when the country had been 
shaken by the October events and elections to a new parliament 
were at issue, the executive required support from a reliable 
lobby. The words of one banker were passed from person to 
person -- if you don't protect us we will not support the 
"Russia's Choice" campaign. 
  The Central Bank then had to act in the way that the 
national 
banks of Finland and Japan once acted -- replacing foreign 
competitors with its own tough demands and forcing our 
commercial banks to increase their incorporation capital (in 
order to improve their reliability), to observe the norms for 
deductions to reserve funds, to submit accounts on time, and so 
forth. Particularly as of the start of this year. 
  But Russia is not Finland. Our business is far too 
criminalized. Commercial bankers have either been forced to 
undertake risky operations, getting rid of anyone who disagreed, 
or staffers of Central Bank of the Russian Federation control 
services have begun to be threatened with reprisals. One 
department chief was attacked and had his dacha torched. 
Weapons then had to be requested for banking inspectorate 
officials. Then instances of their meeting with opposition and 
having their investigations sabotaged came to light. And, 
finally, one last example -- a bomb was thrown at the apartment 
of Ye. Zhabotinskaya, chief of the Central Bank's Novosibirsk 
Administration. 
  Under these circumstances the authorities have decided to 
abandon banking protectionism. I believe this is the only 
sensible step under current conditions.

<F P=106> [Voldemar Koreshkov report: "Edict Fleshed Out"] </F>
  [Text] We would remind you that the Russian Federation 
[RF] president's Edict No. 1003 of 23 May 1994 "On Reform of 
State Enterprises" was published in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA as part 
of the package of economic edicts 24 May this year. 
  Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the RF Government, 
recently issued concrete instructions regarding its 
implementation to a number of federal ministries and departments. 
  In particular, A. Chubays (Russian State Committee for the 
Management of State Property) has been instructed to submit 
draft legislative acts on the reform of state enterprises. The 
Russian Finance Ministry is to submit to the RF Government 
before 20 July 1994 proposals regarding the organization of 
funding for the elimination of a federal state enterprise and 
settlements with creditors. 
  The corresponding federal bodies have been instructed to 
draft and submit to the government prior to 20 June this year a 
coordinated draft decree on the ratification of the model 
charter of a state-funded plant (state-funded factory, 
state-funded farm) created on the basis of an eliminated federal 
state enterprise. 
  July 20 this year is the date prescribed for the submission 
of proposals regarding the procedure for the elimination of a 
federal state enterprise, the creation of a state-funded plant 
on the basis thereof, and the confiscation from the state-funded 
plant (state-funded factory, state-funded farm) of property 
which is not used by it or which is not used as specified, and 
also for the submission of a draft RF Government ruling on the 
procedure for planning and funding the activity of state-funded 
plants. 
  RF ministries and departments have been asked to verify, in 
accordance with prescribed procedure, documents and facts 
pertaining to the activity of state enterprises and to draft 
before 1 September 1994 proposals regarding the creation of 
state-funded plants (state-funded factories, state-funded farms).

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin has instructed the government to draw 
up by 15 September a new taxation program that envisages a 
reduction in the number of different taxes, a reduction in 
privileges for enterprises involving foreign investment, a 
reduction in VAT [value added tax] rates and in-profits tax, and 
a reduction in deductions for social insurance funds from 5.4 to 
3.4 percent of staff wages. Property tax for individuals, on the 
other hand, should be increased substantially.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ruslan Bodelan, chairman of the Odessa </F>
Oblast Council and people's deputy of Ukraine, by Heorhiy 
Vorotnyuk, under the rubric "Election 94"; place and date not 
given: "The Rights of a Region: Real Rather Than Declaratory. 
Ruslan Bodelan, Chairman of the Odessa Oblast Council and 
People's Deputy of Ukraine, Shares His Thoughts on This Problem"] 
  [Text] 
  [Bodelan] First of all, regions should participate in a 
direct and full-fledged manner in drawing up such local budgets 
as would meet all the urgent problems of territories. This is a 
mandatory condition, because to this day there are so many 
dictates and abuses and so many violations of legislation in 
effect by the central structures in this area that oblasts, 
cities, and rayons face extremely difficult situations time 
after time. The last session was also compelled to adopt an 
address to the president, the chairman of the Supreme Council, 
and the Government of Ukraine proposing that they immediately 
take measures in order to ameliorate the financial situation in 
the oblast, which the deputies considered critical. After all, 
the banks withhold all of the revenues of local budgets without 
recourse toward the payment of their debt to the state budget. 
The latter is drawn up in keeping with norms which in no way 
take into account the needs of territories and in essence push 
them across the disaster line. This is how it happens that the 
debt of some rural and rayon budgets exceeds the planned annual 
level of revenues. Besides, the state structures force local 
organs to finance a number of outlays that are not properly 
theirs, and later do not defray the losses. At the same time, 
outlays on the maintenance of enterprises owned by the state are 
not funded from the state budget. These enterprises fail to 
settle with the energy supplier enterprises: The debt of the 
state budget to such enterprises has already exceeded 500 
billion karbovantsy in our oblast. Delays in the payment of 
wages to the employees of organizations have become more 
frequent; hospitals have no funds in order to feed the patients; 
and many other troubles have developed. 
  Here are all the "attractions" of excessive centralization 
for you. Thus, in addition to taking a number of prompt 
measures, the oblast council, which is extremely alarmed by this 
situation, proposed to the structures of authority of the 
country to leave at the disposal of local budgets all receipts 
from the tax on the income of citizens and proceeds from the 
privatization of municipally owned facilities, as well as no 
less than 30 percent of the proceeds from the privatization of 
state-owned facilities. We expect the new parliament to 
accommodate the territories in consolidating their financial 
standing. 
  I think that regions should have more extensive rights in 
setting quotas and issuing licenses for products that are 
exported from their territories, as well as in importing 
products from neighboring countries. Here is a specific example 
for you. It was long the case that a lot of vegetables, fruits, 
and berries were shipped to the Odessa region from neighboring 
Moldova for processing at the local enterprises. Some of the 
finished product was retained by us, the oblast and Ukraine; 
some was returned to the suppliers of raw materials to meet 
their needs. Everybody was happy. Insurmountable obstacles have 
now arisen in the path of such mutually advantageous relations, 
and everything has come to a halt. No, we are not at all against 
borderland and customs rules applying in our state, but they 
should take into account the specifics of relations and the 
feasibility of bans or excessively high customs duties. What 
happens otherwise? Ukraine fails to receive a considerable 
quantity of canned products; we are forced to reduce production 
or altogether close down processing enterprises, laying people 
off. All of this could be avoided if regions had an opportunity 
to regulate such contacts. 
  In a word, if we want to create an effective structure of 
government in the territory of the state, the new Supreme 
Council should adopt without delay an appropriate law which 
would clearly set forth the powers of councils at all levels and 
endow regions with real rights. 
  [Vorotnyuk] As a people's deputy of Ukraine, are you 
personally prepared to introduce some specific proposals in 
conjunction with this? 
  [Bodelan] They have actually already been developed before, 
and have been introduced in the "old" parliament. A special 
working group of our oblast council is currently carrying on 
such work so that the people's deputies from Odessa will be able 
to promptly submit an appropriate draft law, to be considered by 
the Supreme Council. 
  [Vorotnyuk] Understandably, the draft law would apply 
equally 
to all regions of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Odessa area has its 
peculiarities; the oblast council raised a number of issues that 
are strictly its own before the structures of authority of the 
country. In particular, I mean proposals for conducting an 
economic-legal experiment in the oblast and creating free 
economic zones. Have there been any genuine results in this 
matter? 
  [Bodelan] The Presidium of the Supreme Council has 
considered 
our proposals for conducting an experiment that would grant to 
the region additional economic rights and in principle approved 
them. The proposals have been referred to the Cabinet of 
Ministers for the latter to state its point of view. In the 
meantime, legislative acts have already been passed which take 
into account some of these proposals of ours. It is possible 
that decisions of the new parliament and government concerning 
the rights of regions will altogether remove the issue of 
conducting the experiment from the agenda. If they do not, we 
expect that in the future, meeting our requirements with regard 
to one oblast, Odessa Oblast, will provide an opportunity to 
ascertain the effectiveness of what we propose and to extend its 
effect to other regions. 
  Now about the free economic zone. Some believe that there is 
too much talk about it, and too little action. A certain lack of 
coordination was indeed a factor at the first stage. Individual 
enthusiastic leaders got the-bigger-the-better "disease": They 
wanted all of Odessa, and adjacent territories to boot, to be a 
free economic zone. Only after the Cabinet of Ministers set up a 
special committee to develop the Odessa special economic zone (I 
was appointed to head it) and after this committee began 
operations did everything come within a realistic framework. 
With the use of prominent foreign specialists, we are completing 
the development of a draft law on the special economic zone, 
which we are certain the government will submit to the Supreme 
Council for consideration. It is based on setting up five local 
zones in comparatively small territories: in the Odessa, 
Ilyichevsk, Southern, and Izmail ports, and at a 200-hectare 
site in the vicinity of Odessa where the creation of an 
industrial zone is conceivable. This concept has already gained 
the support of the government. The European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development took a positive stance regarding 
it; it has resolved to provide assistance with investment in 
certain projects in the free economic zone. I believe that 
following the passage of the law, we will succeed in drawing not 
only domestic but also foreign investors into the creation of 
free economic zones. It is just that, once again, the oblast 
council should have the appropriate authority to do so. 
  [Vorotnyuk] Well, does the oblast council intend to run the 
free economic zone? 
  [Bodelan] Not directly. However, we propose to set up, under 
the oblast council, a coordinating council which, while 
reporting to both our oblast Council of People's Deputies and 
the Cabinet of Ministers (in line with the authority of both of 
these organs), would facilitate the emergence of the free 
economic zones, help them to establish relations with investors 
and among themselves, and finally be the transmission element 
between the local organs of power and the administrations of the 
free economic zones. Such a structure will possibly operate only 
at the first stage, and later it will be replaced by a more 
feasible one. 
  Therefore, my firm conviction is as follows: While 
preserving 
and strengthening the most significant elements of 
centralization, we should simultaneously create the most 
favorable conditions for the development of territories by 
granting to them additional rights and powers. I am certain that 
by thus playing, so to say, a duet, we will dispense faster with 
the critical phenomena that are now besetting us.

<F P=106> [Article by Maryana Chorna: "The Supreme Council Has </F>
Proceeded From Frictions to Factions. 'Clannishness' Has Begun"] 
  [Text] Kiev-Lvov--On the very first day of the 
session of the new Supreme Council, it became clear that the 
flow of Ukrainian politics had ultimately split into two 
streams--the one that is next to the microphone and the one that 
is beyond it. The first works for the benefit of television, 
whereas the second works for the benefit of history. 
  At the front stage, next to the microphone, a provisional 
presidium consisting of the representatives of leftist, 
rightist, and centrist forces was elected in a traditional 
manner. Meanwhile, in the space away from the microphone, the 
civilized process of the formation of parliamentary factions and 
groups of deputies went on. The Supreme Council gave its 
preference to the association of people's deputies on the basis 
of their political sympathies rather than along regional or clan 
lines, thus breaking down the walls between oblast delegations 
and setting the minimum strength of a faction at 25 persons. 
This was a favorable solution not only because it would stop the 
"Brownian motion" characteristic of the previous Supreme 
Council, but also because, having structured itself, the 
parliament will for the first time reveal to the voters its 
true, although terrifying, identity. Small deputy groups which 
do not have the needed 25 persons will be forced to choose 
between ideologically similar allies and the heroic fate of Don 
Quixote. It appears that the new reality will alter the party 
array of Ukrainian politics beyond recognition. No trace of the 
old parties will remain half a year from now. New political 
bearings will call for new leaders. 
  The formation of the Reforms deputy group, in which two 
reformist centers joined, is considered to be the most prominent 
among the latest events away from the microphone. The centers 
had peacefully drifted through Ukrainian politics without 
drawing closer to each other prior to that. Two presidents--of 
the Market Reforms Foundation and the Foundation in Support of 
Reforms--Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, united in a 
single parliamentary group, having neglected the intense issues 
of leadership. Serhiy Sobolev (the We electoral association from 
Zaporozhye) became the coordinator of the bloc. Rule-of-law 
democracy and economic reform are the political priorities of 
the Lanovyy-Pynzenyk alliance; their accomplishment is 
guaranteed by lawyers, economists, and politicians well known in 
Ukraine who became members of the Reforms deputy group--Serhiy 
Holovatyy, Viktor Shyshkin, Taras Stetskiv, and Hryhoriy 
Omelchenko. It is paradoxical, but a few deputies who were 
supported during the election by the KUN [Congress of Ukrainian 
Nationalists] signed the statement on the creation of the 
Reforms group. Having covered all of Ukraine, from the Donbass 
to the Carpathian Mountains, with authoritative individuals, the 
Reforms group has firmly taken the position of the political 
center. 
  The prototype of the Statehood deputy group, with which 16 
deputies announced their affiliation as of 13 May, is found to 
the right of the Reforms. A group of deputies who are URP 
[Ukrainian Republican Party] members initiated the creation of 
the group. Statehood includes deputies from Right-Bank Ukraine 
and focuses its attention on preserving the integrity of Ukraine 
and separating it from the Russian umbilical cord. If the group 
fails to reach the 25-person cutoff, most of its members will 
undoubtedly migrate to the Pynzenyk-Lanovyy alliance. 
  An association that survived under the rubble of the MBR 
[Interregional Bloc for Reforms] and merged with the remnants of 
the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in the 
Unity group shows the opposite tendency. Valeriy Babych, who 
inherited from the MBR a program of federalization and the 
closest possible relations with Moscow, was destined to become 
its leader rather than Hrynyov or Kuchma. Contrary to its name, 
the Unity group is a motley, unstable parliamentary creation in 
whose entrails the replenishment for adjacent parliamentary 
groups will always be growing. 
  As of 17 March, the documents of the MDF-Center faction, 
headed by Leonid Kuchma--yet another MBR splinter--were also 
sitting in the secretariat of the Supreme Council. 
  The Center deputy group promises to be the heavy artillery 
of 
Ivan Plyushch on the parliamentary front. Its foundation 
consists of the party of power of all hues, which has roots in 
the most remote nooks and crannies of our state. This 
association will suffice for two parliamentary groups. The 
Plyushch party will certainly take advantage of this, 
considering that two groups mean two votes in the presidium. 
  The quality of the cadre composition of the 
Communist-Socialist-Peasant swarm of people's deputies dictates 
its own laws of association in the left wing of the Supreme 
Council. More respectable Socialists might want to dissociate 
themselves from the clamorous Communist limited-liability 
company, but they are lacking five or six individuals in order 
to form a faction. They would have taken in several of the most 
reasonable Communists, but Lenin's tribe would not want to palm 
off less than 20 on them, fearing an independent game of the 
Moroz party. 
  The Communist Party has decided not to go for small change 
and to face the parliamentary trial as the monolithic bloc For 
Social Justice and People's Power (95 persons). 
  In turn, it is very doubtful that there will be enough 
radicals to create their own group. They will hardly scrape up 
25 persons even if the combined UKRP [Ukrainian Conservative 
Republican Party], the UNA [Ukrainian National Assembly] and all 
nationally concerned Rukh members (of the Host of Volyn kind) 
belong to it. The KUN with its deputies firmly sat down between 
two stools. They will now either have to place themselves under 
Khmara, having ultimately left the democratic camp, or honestly 
join the pole of Statehood, having forsaken nationalist 
principles. Actually, it will be both. Understandably, this 
current in the parliament will not transcend the borders of 
Western Ukraine, as it remains a single-region, marginal 
problem. While lively packs of deputies from more abundant blocs 
vigorously milled around the hallways, the "heroes of all times 
and nations" remained in ominous solitude. 
  As always, Rukh is in a haze. God only knows whom its people 
will join. The bright star of Serhiy Holovatyy is already 
shining in someone else's sky. The radicals are looking toward 
the door; Ivan Zayets is quarreling with the "great hetman"; it 
is unknown what is next. 
  The migration of deputies in the corridors revealed what it 
should have revealed--an array of forces in Ukraine to which no 
external movements and parties correspond. There is a clearly 
defined liberal center, which has struck equally powerful roots 
in the east and the west. The spectrum between Lanovyy and 
Pynzenyk holds everything--from Donetsk to Lvov. The 
post-Communist camp is to the left of them. Geographically, this 
means the center of the Right Bank and the Left Bank. 
Politically, it means the party of power and its immediate 
environs all the way to the Labor Congress. Further on, the 
steppes of the Left Bank and the south are represented by 
leftist extremists drawing on a powerful stratum of the local 
Russian-speaking underclass. Ukrainian national democrats who 
cultivate the political values of statehood, that is, 
Christian-Democratic values in European terms, are located to 
the right of the center, to the right of the steep bank of the 
Dnieper. All key Ukrainian parties have placed themselves under 
this common denominator. The extreme radicals rave on the left 
and right banks. Those on the Right Bank draw on the "nationally 
aware" underclass which is socially symmetrical to its Donbass 
counterpart but is separated from it by an insurmountable 
barrier of "nationalist" demagoguery on one side and 
"internationalist" demagoguery on the other. Amid all of this, 
the pro-Russian camp proper, which is concerned about just one 
problem--how to go back to the condition from before 1 
December--springs about on the Left Bank. This company embraces 
everything--from the Civic Congress to what remains of the MBR. 
The system of factions in the new parliament that was approved 
right away will force our politicians to occupy a niche in one 
of the blocs one way or the other, and will thus slow down the 
process of "building a party for yet another charismatic 
leader," which will be worse for the leaders and better for the 
people. So far, this process has developed in the space away 
from the microphone. However, it will shortly reverberate in the 
parliament one way or the other.

<F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Prytula: "They Would No Longer Give a </F>
Wooden Coupon for Yevgeniy Saburov in the Crimea"] 
  [Text] Sevastopol--Although the new Crimean 
authorities strive to keep all of their intrigues and conflicts 
secret, the reverberations of palace quarrels have been sending 
big ripples through the closed doors of offices, disturbing the 
residents of the Crimea who are stupefied by solar and political 
heat. There is ever more talk about the top personalities of the 
Crimean Government, President Yuriy Meshkov and Prime Minister 
Yevgeniy Saburov whom he brought in from Moscow, being at each 
other's throats, and the Crimea getting a new government 
soon. 
  The economist Yevgeniy Saburov from Moscow, who has not been 
recognized or appreciated in his state, ended up in the Crimea 
on a recommendation by Sergey Stankevich, a friend and adviser 
of Yuriy Meshkov. To be sure, local observers believe that 
Stankevich is a friend of the Republican Movement of the Crimea 
chief, insofar as the latter needs a democratic image. Saburov 
also was Meshkov's choice because he was born in Yalta. Having 
just embarked on his career as a deputy prime minister of the 
Crimean Government, Saburov felt major resistance from Meshkov's 
most immediate entourage, and especially from Valeriy 
Grishenkov, the chief of the president's staff, who jealously 
and diligently protected the Crimean president against the 
"pernicious" influence of the deputy prime minister. Besides, 
Yevgeniy Saburov publicly proclaimed his loyalty to Kiev a few 
times and stated that, despite his Russianness, he was against 
the redrawing of borders. 
  On every occasion, the specialist from Moscow indicated that 
he intends to carry out economic reforms. Within the framework 
of these reformist efforts, Yevgeniy Saburov canceled bread 
subsidies on the eve of an election and prepared an edict to the 
effect that the Ukrainian karbovanets is the sole legal tender 
in the territory of the Crimea, which was later signed by the 
president of the autonomous republic. Of course, this is not by 
any means in line with the pre-election promises of Yuriy 
Meshkov about the prompt introduction of a ruble zone on the 
peninsula. Differences and behind-the-scenes skirmishes between 
Saburov's team and the president's staff headed by Viktor [as 
published] Grishenkov, a former colonel of the USSR KGB, ended 
in the disbandment of the entire staff and the dismissal of 
almost all of his associates. Saburov's victory was complete: 
Yet another Muscovite, Viktor Minin, was appointed to the 
position of minister for the issues of state service (in fact, 
the administration of the government and the president). At a 
meeting with journalists, Minin stated that his main task is to 
be a buffer between Meshkov and Saburov and to smooth over 
differences between them. If nothing else, the fact of the 
cancellation by Meshkov of the already mentioned directive of 
the deputy prime minister to raise prices for bread and bread 
products indicates that such differences do exist and are quite 
serious. Saburov responded sharply to this action of the 
president: "Populism never does any good, no matter by what 
political motives it is guided." 
  For now, Yuriy Meshkov will tolerate Saburov for as long as 
he and his team are needed. However, the Crimean president meets 
and consults more readily and with greater pleasure with Oleg 
Rumyantsev, the former head of the Constitutional Commission of 
the Russian Federation and a deputy of the former Supreme Soviet 
of Russia, who has promised to develop a concept for the state 
and legal buildup of the Republic of Crimea. Commenting on these 
contacts of the leader of the autonomous republic, Yevgeniy 
Saburov jealously stated to journalists that as a politician, 
Oleg Rumyantsev does not amount to anything and nobody reckons 
with him in Moscow. Local observers have concluded that the 
Russian advisers of the Crimean president have resolved to 
transplant the infighting between liberals (Saburov) and 
national-patriots (Rumyantsev) in Moscow to the Crimea. 
  Nonetheless, despite the dissimilarity of the views of 
Meshkov and Saburov and the avowed loyalty of the Crimean deputy 
prime minister to Kiev, we should not make him into some kind of 
a Ukrainophile. It is just that he is much more sensible than 
Meshkov, Rumyantsev, and Grishenkov combined. The Crimea now 
finds itself at ground zero in a fight among Russian clans for 
influence on the peninsula, and Saburov's main task is to ensure 
the economic expansion and establishment of specifically his 
clan (Luzhkov, Shokhin, Stankevich) in the Crimea. To this end, 
political stability is needed first of all in the autonomous 
republic. Meshkov's failure to understand this is what brings 
about misunderstandings between him and his deputy prime 
minister. Rumors to the effect that these differences will soon 
be brought to an end are circulating in Simferopol. It appears 
that the days of the semi-Crimean and semi-Muscovite government 
of Yevgeniy Saburov are numbered, primarily because anti-Saburov 
sentiment prevails among the members of the Russia ruling 
faction of the Supreme Council of the Crimea. Who will come to 
take his place--Rumyantsev or Baburin? Or is it Zhirinovskiy? To 
be sure, they have enough such characters of their own here.

<F P=106> [Commentary by NEZAVISIMOST editor in chief Volodymyr </F>
Kuleba, under the "Political Diary" rubric: "Ukraine: `Khmer 
Rouge' in Power"] 
  [Text] The election of the 50-year-old Oleksandr Moroz--the 
Socialist Party leader and in the recent past the leader of the 
Communist Party's odious Group of 239--as the new speaker 
produced the effect of a cold shower not only on the majority of 
analysts and journalists, but mainly on the so-called deputy 
democrats who have been euphoric over the election results. The 
left-wing majority, headed by communists, took 171 votes and 
immediately made it known who is the master in the parliament. 
Against this backdrop, the national-democrats' excuses--they 
voted for Durdynets, they said--sound absurd and ludicrous. 
Vasyl Vasilyovych spent his entire conscious life in the 
Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] and the 
party's elected bodies, rooting out the weed of Ukrainian 
bourgeois nationalism. And now our "nationalists" have not found 
anything better than to support their eternal opponent. 
  The special way the democratic beginnings have been taking 
root in Ukraine is worthy of a separate research. Both tragic 
and amusingly comic twists intertwined here. The day after 
Oleksandr Moroz was elected, many papers published his carefully 
retouched portrait the size of nearly a half of a newspaper 
page, just like in the times of Shcherbitskyy and Brezhnev. But 
what has actually happened? A speaker was elected in the 
parliament--big deal; by the yardstick of a civilized democracy, 
this is an ordinary procedure. Not quite, though. In Ukraine, 
permeated to the bone by Bolshevik ideology, the post of the 
Supreme Soviet chairman meant a lot--this man automatically 
became entitled to all conceivable and inconceivable goodies, 
became a member of the Politburo and the Supreme Soviet's 
Presidium in Moscow. This is not just opening and closing 
sessions, watching compliance with procedure, and giving the 
floor. In the conditions of "wild" democracy, the speaker's job 
may bring unlimited power, as the events of October 1993 in 
Russia proved. Continuing the parallel with Russia, the election 
of Oleksandr Moroz, coming in the footsteps of Ivan Rybkin's 
election, shows, first, that the political pendulum has swung 
sharply to the left, and second, the desire, to put it mildly, 
of a certain part of the population to see the resurrection of 
the "one and indivisible" Union. 
  Still, the role of O. Moroz, as well as that of the 
communists' nominal leader, P. Symonenko, appears to be 
transient. Having lit up brightly on the political horizon, they 
will fade out just as quickly, move into the shadows, giving way 
to either real directors of the spectacle being played out in 
front of us (Georgiy Kryuchkov, Kostyantyn Prodan, and other 
members of the "old guard"), or to other "proxies" like 
themselves should the "masters" decide that their time has not 
come yet. Oleksandr Moroz' tragedy also is in that, having come 
to the post of the speaker with the help of communist forces, he 
has now become their hostage and has lost political 
independence. There is no such thing as a free lunch. This 
elementary truth came to mind when Oleksandr Moroz attempted to 
propose Oleksandr Tkachenko--a veteran protege of the old 
Communist Party nomenklatura--as his first deputy. If before 
this episode the national-democrats, skillfully separated by 
experienced party apparatchiks into factions where they could 
slug it out, still had some illusions regarding their own 
influence on the situation, now they finally understood that for 
the umpteenth time they had been fooled. It became clear that 
the communists, for whom selection and placement of cadres had 
always been the "key point of the whole party work," will not 
surrender without a battle a single commission, job, chair, or 
an ounce of power. This manifested itself especially forcefully 
on 24 May, when the communists, like primitive rhinos, once 
again attempted to push through A. Tkachenko by "piggybacking" 
him on Durdynets as a "package deal." That would be some 
bouquet! Fortunately, the opposition has enough sense to block 
the vote. 
  I dare to suggest that we are in for some impressive 
about-faces on the political scene. We have not heard the last 
word from Leonid Kravchuk, whose desire to declare Crimea a "hot 
spot" is quite understandable--the issue of presidential 
election would then be void naturally. One has to assume that 
Leonid Makarovych will now swing perceptibly to the left, or 
maybe even restore his membership in the Communist Party? 
Actually--and I have already advanced this idea in the 
past--perhaps he never left it, simply carrying out a special 
assignment: to discredit the idea of democracy and democratic 
freedoms in the eyes of the people? He did accomplish this 
brilliantly, as the results of the recent parliamentary 
elections attest. On the other hand, Leonid Makarovych's 
situation today is not enviable. I had the opportunity to see 
the list of the so-called "communist mutants" (traitors, 
turncoats), in which his name was among the top few. 
Eyewitnesses said that Leonid Makarovych got very upset: "Why 
me?" It really must hurt when one is not liked by either side.... 
  I see the following way out of the current situation as most 
acceptable--to create a unified bloc of rightist forces, which 
will include all deputies of democratic orientation, and go into 
flat opposition, leaving it to the communists to form the 
government. Since they do not have their own economic program, 
in a year or two it will become clear that all they are capable 
of doing is leading the country into a dead end (by the way, the 
last three years it was also communist turncoats who were in 
power). This road, albeit unpopular, seems the only acceptable 
one. Nevertheless, I assume that the current democrats will not 
have enough guts to take it. Some have already been bought--by 
an apartment in the "king's preserve," a car, or an official 
position; some will be bought, since there is plenty of bait, 
just hurry and swallow the hook; some are afflicted by outsized 
ambitions; and some are simply naive--but all of them are split 
and scattered, so there will be no common strategy; nobody has 
any intention to be subordinate to someone else, each has its 
own scepter. On the other hand, the current communists--whom the 
populace for some reason calls "Khmer Rouge"--unlike loose 
democrats, distinguish themselves by a high degree of discipline 
and organization. They will have no trouble strangling their 
adversaries one by one in the pursuit of communist ideals. One 
can almost taste this idyll--communists in power and Kravchuk as 
president. 
  That Leonid Makarovych will be reelected as president if the 
elections are moved to fall, I personally have no doubt. The new 
communist-Kravchuk alliance promises that life in Ukraine will 
not be boring.

Ecology of the Person: "The Children are Dying, the Nation is 
Dying"] 
  [Text] Every year we designate a "Day for the Protection of 
Children," though without special festivities. On this day, the 
state is supposed to recall its littlest citizens, its own 
future; but because of various circumstances it does not recall 
the basic principle which was still in use until quite recently: 
"Everything the best for the children." 
  However, doctors are providing accurate statistical data, 
showing that every year, as a result of the ecological 
situation, the health of the children is getting worse. At this 
time, we do not have a state concept of what needs to be done to 
stop this process. 
  Since I have a direct relationship to studying the influence 
of the ecology of the city of Kiev on the state of health of its 
younger population, I wish to share with my readers some of my 
own observations on this subject. 
  First of all, let us turn once more to the sad, even 
terrible 
statistics on the ecological status of Ukraine, so that we can 
once more convince ourselves as to what we have come to by our 
brutal approach toward nature. And toward ourselves as well. 
  Today, the atmosphere of Ukraine is the most polluted among 
all the countries which used to belong to the USSR. Over 40 
percent of the territory of Ukraine, air pollution is two to 
three times greater than the levels in Europe. Every year, over 
110,000 different enterprises send into the atmosphere tens of 
millions of tons of chemically harmful materials ejected from 
means of transportation. In this way, there are almost 300 
kilograms of poisons for every citizen of Ukraine. 
  It is known that 38 percent of incorrect physical 
development 
and growth of a person is conditioned by the surrounding 
environment. Negative genetic changes accumulate in the 
hereditary material from air pollution. If these changes reach 
30 percent, the nation must disappear--this is a biological law. 
For example, this level has already reached 19 to 24 percent for 
the Donetsk-Prydniprovsk region. 
  If the pollution of the atmosphere is 1.2 to 1.5 times 
higher 
than the acceptable levels, it causes significant strains on the 
organism's defense system; if it is more, it leads to illness of 
the immune system. 
  The ground of Ukraine is significantly polluted by wastes, 
and by the uncontrolled use of mineral fertilizers. Vegetables 
grown with them, and fruits with high levels of nitrates and 
nitrites, have a very negative effect on people's health. Add 
radionuclides to this, of which there is quite a bit in plants 
and animals, and the water--and we have a picture of the effect 
of the environment on our health that is not at all exaggerated. 
In fact, materials from water without adequate purification make 
up almost 40 percent of industrial wastes. The water plants of 
the Luhansk, Donetsk, Kirovohrad, Rivne, and Ternopil oblasts do 
not meet sanitary rules. In almost all local drainage waters, 
there is a large content of heavy metals. 
  And this is only a few lines for the ecological "portrait" 
of 
Ukraine, without even touching on the Chornobyl disaster. How 
could the people be healthy? But let us return to the statistics. 
  The general level of illness of the population is 634.7 per 
1,000 people. As a result of ecological disasters, the life span 
in Ukraine has decreased to 68 years (60 years for men, 75 years 
for women). Ukraine is in 32nd place in the world, according to 
this indicator. We have the lowest birth rate among the 
countries of the former USSR (14.5 to 15 children per 1000 
people, in 1991). And this tendency is getting worse. In the 
last three years, child mortality in Kiev in the first year of 
life has grown thus: 1990--12.6, 1991--13.3, 1992--16.4 per 
1,000 births. 
  The high level of child mortality is explained by the 
increased number of children who are born sick. In the last 10 
years, the births of children not capable of life has grown by 
65 percent. If in 1985 14.5 percent of newborns in Kiev were 
sick, in 1992 24 percent were. Especially worrying is the early 
mortality of infants that do not survive their first year. It is 
one and a half times higher than for the republic as a whole. 
And one more troubling number: out of 1,000 births, an average 
of 20 are deformed. Also, the level of mental illness is 
increasing among children. 
  The health of an infant, usually, is transferred to the 
school and older student years. By the end of middle school, 
various chronic illnesses are noted in 46 percent of the pupils, 
and in 50 percent morphological and functional problems are 
present. Today, 5 to 8 percent of the graduates can be 
considered healthy. 
  Children with chronic pathologies now make up 23.4 percent, 
and those with two chronic illnesses, 13.5 percent. About 80 
percent of pre-school children have health problems. Over a 
third of students in schools and professional and technical 
institutes suffer from nervous or psychological disorders. 
  Today in Ukraine, one family in 8 to 12 is childless. And 
one 
girl in five to six has health problems which might effect her 
reproductive function. 
  In Ukraine, for more than three years the population has not 
reproduced itself; the nation is dying. The state of health of 
the nation is a mirror of the nature of Ukraine. The statistics 
are not reassuring. No matter what we wish, the situation will 
not soon get better. But what is there to be done now, when 
eight years have passed since the disaster at the Chornobyl 
nuclear power station? 
  I will begun with something concrete and current: it is 
necessary to lower steadily the level of toxic substances in the 
organs and tissues of children, to the maximally safe levels. 
These poisonous substances essentially get into the organism 
through eating and drinking. With prophylactic methods, the 
child (and the adult) can be healthy even in today's unfavorable 
ecological conditions. 
  The effectiveness of such prophylaxis depends on resolving 
several problems. It is necessary to have simple and reliable 
methods for detecting risk factors for the endoecological 
pollution of the organism, a method of removing from it the 
ecological poison in a controlled way, and means for renewing 
its defense functions. 
  Concepts for such a program were developed in the Institute 
of Physics of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, together with 
a numerous team of doctors. Later, this program began to be 
introduced through a newly formed civic structure: the Institute 
of Ecology of the Person. 
  In the program, fundamentally new methods of investigating 
the endoecological pollution of children were developed, which 
in the majority of cases do not have analogs in the classical 
diagnoses. Besides this, a series of effective methods of the 
endoecological purification of the organism were developed, 
which can be recommended to parents for use in the home. 
  In the year and a half that the introduction of this program 
has been allowed, more than a thousand children of different age 
groups and in different ecological circumstances both in Kiev, 
and outside it, have gone through dispensary investigations. 
Today, certain generalizations can be made. 
  Few children with ecologically pure organisms were found. 
They made up an average of 20 percent of those studied. In 
general, the health of the children of Kievans is now 
practically the same, as that of the children, who were moved to 
Kiev in 1986 from the 30 kilometer zone. In fact, three or four 
years ago there was a quite noticable difference, in the better 
health of the children of Kievans. 
  Investigations show that the basic reason for this is the 
uncontrolled influence of the surrounding 
environment--ecological poisoning. 
  The complex methods which we developed, which are chiefly 
connected with the utilization of prophylactic phytotherapy, 
make it possible to purify the organisms of children from 
ecological poisons by 85-90 percent. This works best when, for a 
period of two or three days before the application of the 
phytotherapy, the children take synthetic enterosorbents, or 
better, natural ones. After this, prophylaxis by 
phyto-preparations is applied for two or three weeks. A 
necessary condition at this stage is control over the organism 
of the child, in order to make certain of the effectiveness of 
the application of the methods of the prophylaxis, for each one, 
individually. 
  In the process of the investigation, certain general special 
points appear. The ingestion of radionuclides has the greatest 
effect on the gastrointestinal tract (over 60 percent), on the 
liver (20 to 30 percent), the kidneys, and the urine bladder, 
since in some children an increase in the radioactivity of urine 
is noted. This rule is clearly noted: in relatively identical 
ecological conditions, younger children, for example pupils in 
the first and second grades, have a pollution of the organism 
two to two and a half times greater than the older pupils. It is 
possible that this shows that the child, as he is growing, 
accumulates more radionuclides and other harmful substances. 
  A basic point in this work is carrying out the controlled 
prophylactic purification of the organism, and proof, that after 
two or three weeks it will really be purified and reach a state 
of relative norm. In this case, it is necessary only to carry 
out, regularly and periodically, such prophylaxis either in home 
conditions, or in kindergartens, and in schools as well. 
  Considering the very important, main role of the mother in 
strengthening the health of a child, we are convinced that good 
results can be achieved when diagnosis and purification of the 
organism, and the renewal of its protective functions, is 
carried out simultaneously by the mother and her child. This is 
especially the case for small children. Indeed, this concerns 
the ecology of the family. When the constant prophylactic 
purification of the organisms of all members of the family is 
looked after, this will be a healthy family. We think that it is 
through the ecology of the family that it is possible to look 
for the survival of the nation in these complex ecological and 
economic circumstances. 
  There is yet one more side to this matter. It is necessary 
for all of the state's pre-school and school institutions to 
move to regulated and controlled ecological conditions. The 
first results of this work in two rayons of Kiev show the great 
usefulness of the organization of ecologically pure 
kindergartens. Moreover, it is possible to carry out in them the 
ecological education of the children, which is an important 
factor in ecoprophylactic endeavors. 
  Since vacations are coming, children and parents are trying 
to begin to get healthy. It would be worth recalling a few 
pieces of advice which can be useful in purifying the organism 
from ecological poisons. 
  Occasionally we remember general health-giving, vitamin, and 
herbal teas. There are many recipes for them. Each family can 
choose several types of such teas for itself. There are many 
medicinal herbs, which people have used for thousands of years, 
and which have curative force because they purify different 
organs and tissues. For example, broth from the leaf of the 
coltsfoot facilitates purification of the kidneys. Tea from the 
leaf of the red bilberry purifies the walls of the blood 
vessels, the liver, and the kidneys. 
  In the summer and fall, each family can prepare for itself 
an 
adequate quantity of medicinal herbs, in the necessary 
assortment, for the winter. They are especially necessary for 
children. 
  Food is also important in making children healthy. To some 
degree it has to be divided up. Foods that have a lot of protein 
(meat and fish), and those largely made up of carbohydrates 
(kasha, bread, baked goods), must be used separately, in one and 
a half to two hours. 
  In all of this, regular purification of the bowels, 
especially the large bowel, can never be forgotten. We recommend 
that all people, children, have cleansing enemas at least once 
every 10 or 12 days. The means for this procedure are simple, 
and there are different ones; every family knows how to do this. 
Let us remember an old truth: if a person takes care of the 
cleanliness of the large bowel, he will avoid almost all 
illnesses linked with environmental pollution. 
  It is possible also to make quite a few recommendations 
concerning general health. There are physical cultures that we 
have half-forgotten, and the applications of baths or saunas, 
when through the pores of the skin various toxins come out of 
the body. It is important to be aware that the health of our 
children is first of all a concern of the family and its 
relationship to ecology. The sooner we understand this in the 
contexts of one family, village, city, oblast, and the country 
as a whole, the better we will protect our children from 
illnesses. 
  Life itself demands that more new professionals join our 
medical services, especially physician-ecologists. At every 
children's polyclinic, offices for the ecology of the mother and 
child should be created, special centers, where each family 
could always have consultations on the ecological pollution of 
the organism of the child. An example could be the office of the 
ecology of the mother and child, which has operated already for 
almost a year in the First Children's Polyclinic of the Moscow 
rayon of the city of Kiev. This office is one of the agencies of 
the Institute of Ecology of the Person. But if our efforts are 
not supported by morally and financially on the state level, 
they might come to nothing. 
  We have to do all this so that the children of Ukraine will 
grow up healthy and strong. In this is the future of our state. 
And the nation. In its entirety. Let us consider this on the 
anniversary of the Chornobyl catastrophe. 
  From the editors. In future work, the author plans to give 
more concrete recommendations for purification of the organism 
of the child from radionuclides.

of Sciences of Ukraine, Director of the World Economy and 
International Relations Institute, ANU [Academy of Sciences of 
Ukraine], Yuriy Mykolayovych Pakhomov "There Can Be Way Out but 
One Must Use Different Methods - Surgical Ones"; it is not the 
first time Yu.M. Pakhomov is quoted in UKRAYINA MOLODA] 
  [Text] Yuriy Mykolayovych, our State has entered the 
next stage of its transformation. This time this stage is 
related to elections of the new Parliament which, one hopes, 
will approve a new Government, and the latter will be pulling 
the reform cart further. However, who these people will be and 
whereto they will be pulling is a problem with a lot of 
unknowns. At least one does not want the cart to be pulled in 
all directions, which has been the case so far, so as a result 
the cart has been oscillating rather than moving. But apparently 
the blessed moment has arrived when one can "stop and look back" 
to understand where we have found ourselves and where we are 
going. 
  - First of all I would like to say that everything is going 
as planned. 
  - ?.. 
  - Well, this is a special plan that no particular person 
approved, but according to the plan everything is happening as 
irreversibly as a certain plant grows out of a certain seed and 
a different plant grows out of a different seed. January 1, 
1992, the Rubicon had been crossed, and objectively inherent 
processes began unwinding... 
  - In other words, you mean price liberalization. 
  - Yes, and as far as the implementation of this project is 
concerned I cannot even give the garland to anybody in Ukraine 
or in the CIS. And not because the project had no adherents. 
Quite the opposite, it hardly had any opponents. And those who 
understood that the project was ruinous to Ukraine were more 
realistic than Don Quixote and did not take to fighting 
windmills. The more so that the "windmills" were portraying 
these folks almost as enemies of the people or at best as 
conservatives. And as far as the project we have been 
implementing in recent years - one cannot even call it an 
International Monetary Fund project. It is a version of one of 
IMF directions. This model has its peculiarities. It was 
developed for certain debtor countries in Latin America - 
countries that don't have a highly developed industry, science 
and education. Then big capital buys up their mineral resources 
and land, and rapid development begins. The land's wealth slips 
away, while financing -somebody else's capital - comes in. And 
the country is surely, if not for good, trapped in debt bondage, 
and the people become impoverished. Still, in undeveloped 
countries this model has rather limited capability of 
destruction, moreover, there is development, albeit one-sided. 
But the story is different when such a model is thrown over a 
country with a highly developed technical basis and high 
scientific potential - the model's destructive force increases 
substantially and yields terrible results. Liberalization, which 
the model envisages as the most important task, begets 
wide-scale inflation and with it the reign of momentary and loss 
of strategic interest. Science, state-of-the-art technology, 
basic education - they are all rejected as unnecessary and are 
rapidly destroyed. This especially happens in countries where 
the State sector rules and the production and technological 
space is deformed. 
  The main thing is the model has not brought prosperity to 
any 
country that adopted it. They are all debtors, all of them 
experience, one way or another, recession and lose their 
education and S&amp;T potential (if any). 
  There is an entire history of countries' resistance to this 
model. In particular, Japan has blossomed not due to but in 
spite of this model. Southeast Asia countries, South Korea, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and now Malaysia also 
have rejected this model. And at the time so did the post-WWII 
Europe. Unlike us, the maximalists, the 1917 people ("we will 
burn to the ground, and then..."), the wise Europe did not allow 
price liberalization for 10 to 15 years. The free market pricing 
mechanism only began working as the necessary conditions were 
being created, first of all mastering and widening the range of 
competitiveness of their industrial and agricultural products, 
although under the Common Market conditions new restrictions on 
all of this were imposed. A prominent reformer Erhard (FRG) had 
started not only with a monetary reform, but also with 
directives. Acting a "Soviet way" he renewed severed contacts 
and by directives forced economic mechanisms to spin. There was 
planning there - at a macroeconomic level. And only when 
everything had been spinning did the economy begin transition to 
the market regulation mode, and only then were prices freed up. 
  By the way, in Japan almost until recently rice had been 
distributed on a plan basis. Price liberalization began in 1984. 
And this was accompanied by strict regulation and monopolization 
of major industries. Powerful corporations, with the State 
standing above them like a cat above a mouse. This is how they 
had shot forth - under State protection, by concentration of 
effort and prevention of chaos. 
  One of Ukraine's, as well as Russia's, peculiarities is an 
ugly structural and production space. Prices and the entire 
financial mechanism had been "fitted" to this ugliness and 
deformed accordingly. The balance demanded correction, but via 
technical modernization rather than via prices. And as far as 
"freeing up" prices, under those conditions these measures, 
being just the start, could only produce an explosive effect and 
ruin the economy. First one should have evened out the 
proportion of heavy and light industries, of MIC 
[military-industrial complex] and "civil" sectors (the MIC is an 
immovable rock that can wreck any reform). One should have 
gotten rid of multiple production structures which included 
everything - from archaic structures of the late 19th century to 
supermodern technologies the world did not even suspect existed. 
In other words, our economic structure first should have had to 
undergo internal transformation through pre-market structural 
changes, whereas the freeing up of prices resulted in paralysis 
of the economy. Hence the crisis of payments, clots, the 
recession, barter and other distortions. 
  And now we cannot do what we could and should have done 
before. There can be a way out, but one must use different 
methods - surgical ones. 
  - It was not our initiative to start price 
liberalization. So did we have a choice and was the Government 
able to actually correct anything under these conditions? 
  - The foundation for adopting this destructive for us model 
had been laid as early as during the M.S. Gorbachev time. It is 
then that the criminogenic revolution had begun and economic 
power shifted from the State to a legalized shadow economy. It 
is then that the wave of liberal market euphoria had risen, and 
the people were told to expect a miracle from completely 
unlimited economic freedom. Ideas of statehood and its decisive 
role in the transition to market were rejected. Instead of ideas 
of State renewal and market transformations slogans "The less of 
the State the better" were reigning. And we finally had found 
ourselves in a wild stream of market chaos. This was not a 
confession of modernity but rather of the passing archaic 
market. And those who looked innovative were in essence 
conservatives. Because the modern market is an integral 
combination of market and State forces. 
  - So what is one to do now - loose heart? "Don't waste 
your effort, buddy..."? 
  - Well, first of all every wild stream has an end. But, as 
long as it is carrying us, the faster the better. And the more 
market mechanisms we adapt for the economy the better hope there 
is that the necessary critical mass will be created in 
individual places. But there are things that have to be subdued. 
For instance, prices in the production sector will not stabilize 
on their own - they depend on technological skewness. Their 
explosive movement is not leading to an emergence of motives for 
improving the situation in the economy. 
  At present prices in the consumer sphere have been stopped 
using a purely monetary method. But at what price? No credit had 
been extended, so no payments were made - and prices stopped. 
  - Are you against monetary methods? 
  - I am against excessive reliance on them. Besides, their 
action here is fairly limited to the consumption sphere while 
the sources of inflation are in production. There is a certain 
hierarchy of tasks and methodology for achieving them. Here is 
an example. First of all one must stop hyperinflation. And not 
in the consumption sphere but in the huge ocean of State 
facilities where expenses are increasing unceasingly, taking 
prices with them. Nothing can be done here by using direct 
regulation and command economy methods. 
  It is necessary to form a new type of self-organization that 
would combine market centralism and market self-regulation. 
Market centralism is not just a certain action by the State. 
This is also centralization using financial institutions, as 
well as regulation of the economy on the part of transnational 
companies, industrial-financial groups, syndicates, corporations 
etc., which, by using their internal mechanisms and because of 
complex hierarchy and synchronous interaction, affect processes 
of price stabilization along complex technological chains. 
  I have no doubt that in the end the very mechanisms of 
market 
centralization combined with market self-regulation will 
facilitate successful implementation of those individual 
anti-inflation measures that at present under the market chaos 
conditions have no effect. 
  - So who will personify this strong authority? The 
President? The Verkhovna Rada? The Prime Minister? 
  - He who controls executive structures. If it is the 
Cabinet, 
then not a pocket-size one but a Cabinet that has complete 
authority to tame the situation. 
  - Similar to the authority Kuchma had a year ago? 
  - Maybe even greater. 
  - And an Erhard-like person at the helm? 
  - The further down we fall the more chances there are such a 
person will emerge. Despair always begets new ideas and new 
leaders. So far there has been mainly demand for populists and 
destroyers... Among the creators of the new way there was no 
strong reformer, both in terms of ideas and strong character, as 
well as experience. I especially regret that we did not "recall" 
from Moscow Yuriy Yaremenko of Ukrainian extraction. As far as I 
am concerned he had no match within the former Union. Even 
Shatalin, a whimsical egoist, even he considered him a 
first-class figure of unattainable stature. 
  - So how should such a person act? 
  - First alternate centralist economic and purely market 
decrees on inflation quenching measures. 
  Then the long-term mechanism of gradual straightening of 
structural and technological deformations and transition to 
market regulation comes into action. I would also like to 
caution our reformers against their belief that free prices will 
regulate everything by themselves. This too is ancient archaism 
and ignorance. At work in the world are mechanisms of market 
decentralization that cover entire industries and industry 
complexes. General Motors, as well as well-known German 
companies are multi-industry structures that include thousands 
of enterprises. Within chains of technological links, each 
depending on another, everybody who is ahead holds in check the 
trend to increase prices exhibited by the one who is ahead of 
him [per original]. This is how mutual regulation works. 
Competition, as well as a fight for profits are concentrated at 
end points of long technological chains. There are companies 
that represent industries of the entire world, not just of their 
countries. In these companies competition works in the end 
product at the world scene. 
  - What do you think: will we have our house in order in 
about ten years? 
  - It will happen sooner. What is destined to rise will rise 
as if it has been leavened. World capital immediately supports a 
rising country. It becomes extremely profitable for investment. 
We should only take the right steps.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Doctor of Economic Sciences </F>
Volodymyr Chernyak by S. Slyusarevska: "How to `Cure' 
Inflation"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Professor Doctor of Economic Sciences 
Volodymyr Chernyak, the outstanding scientist and politician, 
talks with journalist S. Slyusarevska about his conception of 
anti-inflation policy. 
  [Slyusarevska] Our economy is badly ailing. One of its 
ailments is inflation. Various ways to "cure it" have been 
proposed. In your opinion, Volodymyr Kyrylovych, what is the 
distinguishing feature of a method of "curing" inflation? 
  [Chernyak] The nature of the inflation. A particular set of 
"cures" should be used depending on the nature of the inflation. 
Spending inflation requires one kind, demand inflation requires 
another. In our case, spending inflation has combined with 
demand inflation, although spending inflation predominates. In 
Ukraine, inflation is of a monetary, structural, and 
institutional character. Hence, the Ukrainian version of 
inflation has a very complex nature. Hence, the "cure" for 
inflation has to be integrated, consistent, and specific. The 
situation requires a combination of "cures." Ukraine's 
anti-inflation policy has to combine monetary and nonmonetary 
methods (with emphasis on the latter, I believe). There has been 
too little effort to limit the amount of money in circulation 
(to restrain monetary and credit emissions and uncontrolled 
wages), and in any case that is not the decisive condition for 
curbing inflation. It would be sufficient if inflation was 
merely a monetary process. Hence, the ineffectiveness of purely 
monetary methods of curbing inflation in Ukraine is an objective 
fact. 
  [Slyusarevska] By the way, what is the level of inflation in 
Ukraine right now, and what tendencies are apparent? 
  [Chernyak] Inflation in 1993 added up to 4619 percent. In 
that regard, Ukraine ranked second in the world after 
Yugoslavia. Toward the end of last year, inflation ran as high 
as 80 to 100 percent per month. Starting early this year, 
however, the rate dropped substantially: retail prices rose by 
19.2 percent in January, 12.6 percent in February, and 5.7 
percent in March. That effect was gained through purely monetary 
methods--stopping the issuance of bank notes (as a result of 
which wages were not paid regularly) and implementing a tough 
credit policy (as a result of which mutual settlements between 
enterprises practically halted). Naturally, it is impossible to 
go on for long not paying wages and not extending credit, and as 
soon as the taboo is lifted the inflation spiral begins anew. 
Monetary measures produce an effect swiftly, but it vanishes 
just as quickly. 
  We need nonstandard, nontraditional solutions. In 
particular, 
nonmonetary methods of curbing inflation--more specifically, a 
combination of monetary and nonmonetary methods. Monetary 
methods alone tend to suppress demand and paralyze the incentive 
to work and invest. 
  [Slyusarevska] Now let's find out what the causes of 
inflation in Ukraine are. 
  [Chernyak] Indeed, in order to cure an illness you have to 
treat its causes, not its symptoms. The basic culprits of 
inflation in our country are not rising wages or even monetary 
and credit emissions but rather the shortage of goods, declining 
productivity, the lack of effective incentives to work, 
structural distortions of the economy, monopolism and 
corruption. Although, to be sure, we cannot discount monetary 
and credit emissions, subsidies and indexation of earnings. 
  [Slyusarevska] In your view, what has been our government's 
biggest mistake in anti-inflation policy in the past few years? 
  [Chernyak] If we can talk about any anti-inflation policy of 
our government at all, we must point out that over the past two 
years it has been oriented toward freezing wages and controlling 
enterprise consumption funds--hence, restraining effective 
demand. This is definitely in conflict with our realities. 
  [Slyusarevska] What would the right thing be? 
  [Chernyak] As I have said, spending inflation predominates 
here. Yet the policy which the government and the National Bank 
have been conducting is more suitable to demand inflation. An 
element of anti-inflation policy such as suppressing effective 
demand works effectively only where there is a market, and not 
just a market but a buyer's rather than a producer's market. But 
conditions here are quite otherwise today. Therefore, 
suppressing demand as an element of anti-inflation policy must 
be relegated to the background. Let me emphasize that while I do 
not deny its importance overall, I am merely pointing out that 
the emphasis has to be placed correctly. In our situation, 
prices on goods are not going down despite weak demand. 
Depressed demand is one of the causes of declining production. 
All countries having a developed market economy try to stimulate 
rather than suppress demand. So we will have to apply different 
tools of anti-inflation policy. 
  [Slyusarevska] Which, specifically? 
  [Chernyak] The development of the production of goods and 
services must serve as the foundation of anti-inflation policy. 
We face the necessity of simultaneously stopping the decline in 
production and rising prices. As a rule, just one thing happens 
in the world--either prices go up, or production volumes go 
down. In our case, however, there is an ominous combination of 
processes which economic scientists call "stagflation" (that is, 
a combination of stagnation and inflation). Therefore, the most 
effective anti-inflation measure today would be to boost the 
production of consumer goods. The main thing is to saturate the 
market with goods, and everything else will follow. 
  [Slyusarevska] But how is that to be done? As they say, the 
spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.... 
  [Chernyak] By designing effective incentives to work and 
invest. This is possible on the basis of privatization in 
various forms, the creation of an environment fostering the 
development of entrepreneurship, liberalization of foreign 
economic activities, as well as promoting stabilization--that 
is, establishing a finance system--all of which requires changes 
in monetary, budget, tax, and credit policies. Primarily, 
anti-inflation measures are those which foster the development 
of the production of goods, making it more effective and 
competitive. 
  [Slyusarevska] This question would seem to merit more 
elaboration. 
  [Chernyak] Our main problem is production (to which, owing 
to 
disastrous anti-inflation policies, we must also add the problem 
of sales) rather than inflation. The development of production 
is closely linked to transformations in ownership relations, 
including ownership of the means of production, land, and 
property, the formation of market mechanisms and the development 
of entrepreneurship, and restructuring of the economy 
(eliminating structural disproportions on the macro-level and 
streamlining [sanatsiya] enterprises on the micro-level). Any 
anti-inflation policy can be successful only on the basis of 
privatization. Privatization is an anti-inflation measure 
because, first of all, it fosters the designing of effective 
incentives to work and invest, and, second, it serves as a 
source of revenue for local and state budgets. It is possible to 
balance money and goods only on the basis of structural shifts 
in favor of the production of consumer goods rather than by 
raising prices and freezing wages. Incidentally, the only 
inflation that is dangerous is the kind that doesn't work to 
effect restructuring of the economy. 
  [Slyusarevska] Hence, structural policy also requires the 
rethinking of certain changes. What ones, specifically? 
  [Chernyak] We're talking about changes in structural policy 
which must include these basic directions: the releasing of 
energy, raw materials, financial, and labor resources from the 
extractive sectors and the military-industrial complex and 
channeling them into the production of food and other consumer 
goods in order to bring the economy's consumption sector out of 
its crisis; instituting of a complex of measures to supply the 
economy with fuel and energy resources (expanding exploration 
work, creating joint stock companies to boost the output of 
petroleum on our own territory and in the oil and gas regions of 
other countries, the construction of a tanker fleet and oil 
terminals, rebuilding of oil refineries, making use of 
alternative energy sources, and implementing an active energy 
and resource conservation policy). 
  I would also include these things among necessary changes in 
structural policy: the development of science-intensive and 
ecologically clean industries and the enhancement of our export 
potential and production of goods to trade for imports. Any 
structural policy can be effective only on the basis of 
activating innovation and investment activity, the material 
basis of which is the development of investment 
machine-building, which has been badly neglected. Imported 
equipment can improve the technological structure of capital 
investments. To the foregoing we must add the following: 
measures that are anti-inflationary are those linked to the 
creation of a competitive environment. Hence, anti-monopoly 
policies are anti-inflationary at the same time. 
  [Slyusarevska] Among measures of anti-inflation policy, what 
importance do you assign to the streamlining of production? 
  [Chernyak] High priority. What is needed is a scalpel in a 
firm hand, and let's not forget that there must be trust in that 
hand. And let's not forget the anesthesia. It is obvious that we 
have to give up on supporting inefficient enterprises and design 
a mechanism for financial bankruptcy. The longer we avoid 
dealing with this problem the worse things get. Applying the 
financial and credit system to the process of supporting 
enterprises' artificial solvency only serves to foster inflation 
swings. Let me emphasize that bankruptcy may constitute 
retribution, but under our conditions enterprises frequently go 
bankrupt as a result of depreciation of their own reserves, a 
shortage of circulating capital, excessive interest on their 
loans, and nonpayments (a nonpayment crisis provokes inflation). 
When instituting streamlining, of course, we need to see to it 
that its negative social consequences are neutralized as far as 
possible (in particular, unemployment). 
  One essential condition for enterprise streamlining is the 
abolition of state orders as interpreted by the Cabinet of 
Ministers. The only thing that should be preserved is the state 
contract between enterprises and state clients which pay for 
orders from state resources (or credits). We need to allow banks 
to accept state property as collateral, so that if the 
enterprise is unable to pay, the banks can sell the property for 
the market price. The problem of streamlining is closely linked 
to privatization (bankruptcy is a form of privatization). To 
overcome inflation we need to bring the main elements of the 
national wealth into commodity circulation--the means of 
production, state property, and land. 
  [Slyusarevska] What role is assigned to reducing the state 
budget deficit in implementing anti-inflation policy? 
  [Chernyak] In 1993, the budget deficit stood at 25 percent 
of 
the gross domestic product, which is higher than in any of the 
neighboring post-socialist countries. Ukraine has a chance to 
wind up in the "Guinness Book of World Records." And because the 
budget deficit is a cause of inflation, reducing it and 
balancing revenues and expenditures constitute a vital direction 
in anti-inflation policy. State budget revenues can be increased 
by formulating and implementing an effective new taxation 
system, liquidating unjustified tax breaks and changing tax 
rates in order to stimulate business, also improving the work of 
the tax inspectorate; introducing land taxes and fees for 
natural resources; revising taxes on citizens' property and 
individual income which are not invested in production; 
converting to settlements for exported goods in world market 
prices; introducing economically justified tariffs on foreign 
goods transported over Ukrainian territory; and introducing 
state securities to make up for the budget deficit. In order to 
reduce the expenditure portion of the budget it is necessary to 
liquidate budget loans and subsidies to losing enterprises, 
reduce the number and size of sectorial ministries and their 
departments and local agencies, abolish budget loans and 
financing of capital investments of enterprises, revise certain 
social programs, restrict migration into Ukraine by pensioners 
from other countries, and include the pension fund and social 
insurance fund in the budget. Under present conditions, it is 
useful to draw up the budget quarterly, because the financial 
system is virtually destroyed. 
  [Slyusarevska] What about wages? Rising wages are also a 
cause of inflation. 
  [Chernyak] Yes, but not the main one. Rising wages are a 
cause of inflation when they are paid for by means of monetary 
emissions--that is, when the wage dynamic is divorced from the 
production dynamic. Hence, we need a correlation between the 
size of wages and the dynamic of production as well as the 
dynamic of prices. One mechanism for slowing wages can be 
taxation. Therefore, wages need to be indexed, and control over 
enterprises' consumption funds must be abolished. 
  [Slyusarevska] Let's discuss the controversial question of 
credit. Should credit be cheap or costly? 
  [Chernyak] It is hard to give an unequivocal answer. In 
order 
to provide sufficient credit to the economy, of course, we need 
to increase rather than reduce credit resources. What I have in 
mind is mobilizing real credit resources. Credit should be 
granted primarily on the basis of collateral, which will require 
the institution of a lien law. The national economy can be 
restructured only on the basis of credit and tax breaks. Hence, 
we need to combine a tough financial policy with respect to 
existing production facilities, on the one hand, and a policy of 
cheap credit for the restructuring of the economy, on the other. 
Generally, demand inflation is generally "treated" with costly 
credit, but what we have, keep in mind, is spending inflation. I 
would say that the essence of the problem is not excessive 
credit emissions but rather the ineffective application of the 
credit mechanism. Credit can be both inflationary and 
deflationary (if it fosters restructuring, renovation of the 
production apparatus, acceleration of capital circulation, and 
plentiful goods in the market). It is obvious that credit should 
not be extended fanwise but along the chain of producers. It is 
urgently necessary to change the system of refinancing, having 
created a market of credit resources so that each bank can buy 
them and invest them in profitable projects. 
  [Slyusarevska] A final question: What should we do with 
traditional--monetary--"cures?" 
  [Chernyak] Apply them in definite doses and certain 
combinations with other "cures." Any effort to curb inflation 
requires substantially limiting amounts of money in circulation. 
The general rule is this: the amount of money in circulation 
must not increase faster than production. Excess money in 
circulation leads to increased prices. The essence of the 
question is what means to use to limit the amount of money in 
circulation. We need to replace direct monetary emission by 
National Bank credits. It is possible to limit money in 
circulation by issuing securities (stocks, bonds, and so on), 
and also through the circulation of notes as a form of mutual 
settlements. The most reliable form of securities is the 
issuance of earmarked loans for projects which can be put into 
operation swiftly (for example, the production of food products, 
medical equipment, education, and so forth), also the issuance 
of municipal loans for specific programs.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yevheniya Romaniv: "A :`White Crow' in a </F>
Black Business: An Economic Commentary"] 
  [Text] The wave of auctions in Lvov has crashed against the 
reinforced-concrete parapet of prices. Facilities being 
privatized cost more than a billion coupons, and this could make 
not only work collectives insolvent, but also newly appeared 
businessmen and entrepreneurs. Some of these fat moneybags with 
dubious credentials have begun to fear that the appropriate 
organs really will insist upon declarations regarding their 
incomes--something which the police chief has already threatened. 
  But here's an unprecedented occurrence, which is included 
neither in this scheme nor in our understanding of business. One 
private firm withdrew its application to participate in a recent 
auction because the required packet of suitable documents... 
does not provide for the submission of a declaration regarding 
income. Just what is all this about? 
  Teodor Dyakiv, the general director of this firm--which is 
named Formula--has interpreted the motives for his action as 
follows: "If the people's patience snaps, business will be 
ruined; it will not be explained that some of us are conducting 
it honestly, and all of us will be completely wiped off the face 
of the earth. We have to bear this in mind if we wish to 
preserve and safeguard our own business affairs. The situation 
in Ukraine's business nowadays is such that it allows 
questionably obtained money (shadow capital) and illegally 
acquired foreign currency to be used for the purpose of buying 
facilities to be privatized. And, as a result of this, 
mafia-type groups are able to legalize their own capital, and 
foreign firms can buy our properties at prices that are as low 
as one-hundredth the amounts required from Ukrainian buyers." 
  The fact that privatization in Lvov has started down an 
illegal, criminal, anti-Ukrainian, and antistate path is no 
secret for its organizers. At a recent seminar on the topic of 
market reforms Mr. Pakholyuk, the former head of this city's 
Communal Property Fund, openly declared that the legalization of 
stolen money was being allowed, and predatory foreign capital 
was being brought into Ukraine during the course of 
privatization. This unprincipled attitude runs through 
practically every briefing in the city administration when 
matters come up regarding the auctions, privatization, municipal 
problems, or the budget. The treasury needs money, and the 
mayor's office views the sale of certain nonresidential 
facilities as a source of it. Nor do they look too closely at 
those persons or firms who pay more for a hotel, barber shop, or 
store. But what will be the political consequences of such an 
approach? What will be the reaction of the population to this 
kind of privatization? Can a so-called middle class of 
property-owners--the foundation of economic stability--be 
created by following such a path? 
  None of this coincides at all with Mr. Dyakiv's plans to 
begin a national business in Ukraine--one which would not reduce 
the people to rags, but rather help to raise their standard of 
living. For--sooner or later--we will have to eradicate the 
mafia from Lvov, before it has eradicated us. The only 
surprising thing is that the process of small-scale 
privatization--which would be more suitably termed grabbing--is 
being carried out under the monitoring controls of the IFC 
[International Finance Corporation]--an independent member of 
the World Bank that is working together with 101 of the world's 
countries. In order to understand what kind of a goal this 
corporation has set for itself, all we have to do is become 
acquainted with an interview that Roberta Feldman--an IFC 
expert--granted to the newspaper DILO. She openly stated that 
consultants for privatization projects are recruited and 
selected for the corporation based on the following three 
criteria: "knowledge of the country's language, a fundamental 
knowledge of economics, and the desire to live in the country 
concerned. Experience in small-scale privatization is not a 
mandatory requirement inasmuch as very few people have such 
experience." And so these are the consultants! All they have to 
be is an unemployed economist in the world, and they can come to 
someone else's country and teach the people there something 
about which they themselves have not the slightest idea! No 
wonder we have such lamentable results with regard to our market 
reforms. 
  Nor did Ms. Feldman conceal the fact that the program 
entitled "Small-Scale Privatization in Ukraine" is a 
high-priority item for the corporation, as well as for the 
American Government, which is compensating the IFC for more than 
half of its total expenditures on this project. It would be 
naive to expect the United States to throw away a packet of 
"greenbacks" for the sake of helping the prosperity of Ukrainian 
business. Where the interests of Dyakiv's entrepreneurs and 
those of Genshaft [as transliterated] clash, for example, Mr. 
Teodor Dyakiv can hardly expect aid from the American 
Government. Therefore he is knocking on Ukrainian doors for the 
time being by way of acknowledging his subordination to the 
local authorities. Also lying on the desks of many persons in 
high municipal and oblast-level posts are numerous statements of 
his and "notes of protest" against the methods of small-scale 
privatization, which--in fact--constitute the great grabbing in 
Lvov. Mr. Teodor Dyakiv considers that such a document on the 
privatization of communal property as "A Declaration on the 
Distribution of the Statute Fund Among Its Founders" 
unconditionally permits private firms to buy up real estate at 
reduced prices on the accounts of other--as a rule--foreign 
firms. The authors of a packet of these documents (including 
some from the IFC)--to Mr. Dyakiv's way of thinking--do not know 
either the principles of the financial functioning of 
enterprises with various different forms of property ownership, 
or the actual possibilities of the tax inspectorates within the 
bounds of their jurisdiction. Therefore, he has proposed that 
the participants in an auction submit a "Declaration on the 
Origin of Capital," which would include a paragraph to the 
effect that the results of a buying-and-selling transaction can 
be revoked by a court if the winner at an auction has concealed 
the actual origin of his funds. Teodor Dyakiv considers that 
competitors will make sure that attention is drawn to the 
revelation of such facts. In his opinion this endeavor will 
lower the astronomical prices on the facilities being 
privatized, increase the real chances of buyers' associations, 
and weaken the justifiable opposition to these auctions on the 
part of the population. But the most important thing is that it 
will impel business toward playing the game honestly. 
  Mr. Dyakiv has his own plan for carrying out small-scale 
privatization. He is proposing that an appraisal be made of the 
value of each particular facility, based on a 100-point scale. 
Potential participants in an auction would have to have an 
independent auditing firm verify the legality of their income 
and the absence of unregistered foreign capital. Provisions are 
made for according certain measures of relief and assistance to 
workers' collectives for the purpose of buying property. As to 
the integrity of real estate nowadays, his proposal would see 
that facilities located within certain buildings are to be 
resold as private property together with the land plots on which 
they are situated. And for those persons interested in locating 
their businesses there it is proposed to introduce a "leasing 
certificate"--a security for restricting the right of property 
ownership. However, this certificate would also guarantee the 
return to the owner of expenditures (for example, those spent on 
repairs) by way of selling the certificate in case its owner 
should decide to terminate his business at that location. After 
a certain length of time the "leasing certificate" would be 
exchanged for a document of ownership, whereas the leasing 
payment would be replaced by a tax on the real estate involved. 
  All these provisions--in the firm opinion of this Ukrainian 
entrepreneur--would return business to a place within the 
framework of the law. They would also attract a wider circle of 
buyers to privatization, as well as making the latter genuine, 
accessible, and suitable for a market economy. 
  Well now, we can only rejoice that some white crows will be 
appearing in our business, which--in the imagination of the 
masses--is black.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Constantly Lower and Lower"] </F>
  [Text] According to the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Statistics the indices of our economic activity, or more 
precisely, our inactivity, are going down. 
  Thus in the first quarter the decline of social production 
accelerated in the country. The gross domestic product decreased 
by comparison with the same period of last year by 34 percent 
and the national income produced was down 36 percent. The volume 
of production as compared with the first quarter of last year 
dipped by 38 percent while labor productivity went down by 32 
percent. Production cutbacks took place at up to three-fourths 
of the industrial enterprises. The drop in production affected 
the absolute majority of basic types of production both in 
industry and agriculture. 
  In the first quarter of 1994 collective and interfarm 
agricultural enterprises and sovkhozes produced almost a third 
less meat in live weight than in the corresponding period of 
last year, 21 percent fewer eggs, and the milk yield was almost 
at the level of last year. Cattle and poultry breeding decreased 
by 11 percent. 
  The building of production facilities declined. There was a 
slowing down in the rates of construction of projects in the 
social sphere and some 46 percent less housing was made 
available than in the same period of last year. 
  The operation of transport deteriorated further as a result 
of the decrease in production, the break in economic ties, 
nonfulfillment of contractual obligation, and the shortage of 
fuel: the dispatch of freight by rail was down 25 percent. The 
greatest drop in shipments (more than twofold) was noted in 
motor transport. The rate of decrease in passenger 
transportation on the whole amounted to 18 percent. 
  The report of the Ministry of Statistics stresses that the 
further growth of processes involving lack of balance in state 
finances is also one of the manifestation of the crisis 
situation in the economy of Ukraine. 
  The state budget of Ukraine involves a deficit of 8.6 
trillion karbovantsy. The budgets of the Republic of Crimea and 
of the oblasts and cities of Kiev and Sevastopol were prepared 
with an insignificant excess of revenues over expenditures. 
  Currency emission in the first quarter of this year came to 
10.8 trillion karbovantsy and increased by comparison with the 
same period of last year by a factor of more than 36. 
  At the same time a monthly decrease in inflation was 
observed 
in the first quarter of 1994. In January its index amounted to 
119.2 percent, in February to 112.6 percent, and in March to 
105.7 percent. 
  During the quarter consumer prices rose overall by a factor 
of 1.4 as compared with a factor of 2.7 during the same period 
last year. It should be noted that in the first quarter of 1994 
the rate of price increases for nonfood consumer items and paid 
services for the population outstripped those for food products 
by a factor of two. 
  A decrease in prices took place for certain groups of 
foodstuffs, such as meat products, butter, eggs, and citrus 
fruit. Products in mainly the fruit and vegetable group (except 
citrus fruit) became more expensive. 
  Parenthetically it is necessary to note here that both 
domestic and foreign expert economists explain the paradox of a 
decrease in inflation rates by the fact that wages are not paid 
the population for months at many enterprises, which further 
aggravates the already extremely low purchasing power of the 
citizens of Ukraine. 
  Among essential nonfood consumer items the prices for 
children's clothing, children's shoes, books, and newspapers, 
office supplies, and pharmaceutical products increased the most. 
  The cost of public transportation, leisure and cultural 
services as well as barbering services rose the most among paid 
services for population. 
  The situation with production of consumer goods remains 
difficult. Thirty-nine percent less was produced in the first 
quarter than in the first quarter of 1993. Almost three-fourths 
of the enterprises cut back their output and by comparison with 
the first quarter of last year the shortfall in consumer goods 
amounted to 38 trillion karbovantsy. Over 45 percent of that sum 
is accounted for by products of enterprises of the State 
Committee on the Food and Processing Industry and the Ministry 
of Agricultural Production, and almost 20 percent by those of 
the State Committee for the Light and Textile Industry. 
  The number of those employed in all spheres of economic 
activity in the first quarter remained virtually unchanged and 
amounted to almost 24 million persons (without those engaged in 
study while on leave from production, military personnel, and 
those in housekeeping). By the beginning of January the 
unemployment level in Ukraine as a whole was 0.29 percent of the 
able-bodied population. 
  Again, let us note parenthetically that what is desired is 
being depicted as reality inasmuch as that figure certainly does 
not reflect the massive hidden unemployment that exists today at 
hundreds of enterprises in the country. 
  The Ministry of Statistics notes that the crime rate 
continues to rise. The number of crimes recorded by organs of 
internal affairs exceeded the level reached in the same period 
of 1993 by 16 percent. 
  Over two-thirds of all recorded crimes were against 
property: 
theft of state and collective property and crimes against 
private property of citizens. 
  There was an increase in illegal foreign currency 
operations. 
Some 1,030 cases of illegal trade activity were revealed 
exceeding the amount in the first quarter of 1993 by a factor of 
3.3. 
  The population of Ukraine on 1 April 1994 was 52.1 million. 
In the first quarter the number of deaths exceeded births by 
75,000.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor V. Chernyak, doctor of economic </F>
sciences: "What To Save: the Hair or the Head?" 
  [Text] Inflation rates declined considerably over the 
past several months in Ukraine from 80-100 percent at the end of 
last year to 12.6 percent in February, 5.7 percent in March, and 
6 percent in April of this year. How should that be viewed? In 
several ways, I believe. On the one hand that is a sign of 
economic stabilization, primarily of the monetary system. On the 
other hand the slowing down of inflation is accompanied by a 
sharp drop in production (this drop amounted to 39.1 percent in 
four months of this year as compared with the same period last 
year). In essence that spells destruction of the economy. 
  In economics not only the result is significant but also the 
method by which it was obtained. A decrease in the rates of 
inflation was obtained by strictly monetary methods: by the 
conduct of a rigid monetary and credit policy, as well as a 
policy of wage freezing. Over the past four months wages 
remained at the same level. In February the average wage of 
workers in the state sector amounted to 760,100 karbovantsy, 
which is 40 percent below the minimum consumer budget. The 
freezing of wages and their irregular payment resulted in 
diminished demand becoming a factor in lower production, while 
poor credit availability aggravated the nonpayment crisis. 
Inflation cannot be slowed down by halting production. That 
would be saving the hair but losing the head. 
  At present the main issue is not curbing inflation but 
animating production. Our principal problem is not the problem 
of inflation, but that of production, and now also that of 
marketing because of the depressed demand. It is necessary to 
bear in mind not only the growth rate of prices, but also their 
level (compared to wages). 
  The government anti-inflationary policy of the past two 
years 
was directed at restraining wages and controlling enterprise 
consumption funds, that is, at the suppression of effective 
demand. V. Lanovyy and especially V. Pynzenyk were responsible 
for its formulation. Such a policy does not suit our realities 
since in our case we have mostly an inflation of costs and not 
an inflation in demand. Suppression of demand conditions a 
further decline in production and it is specifically the decline 
in production and a shortage of goods today that constitute the 
main reason for inflation, along with, of course, monopolism and 
the lack of a competitive environment. 
  Therefore the development of production on the basis of 
privatization, demonopolization, restructuring, promotion of 
entrepreneurship, and stabilization of the financial system must 
become the basis of the anti-inflationary policy. It is clearly 
necessary to introduce indexation of wages and all income while 
eliminating control over enterprise consumption funds.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleksandr Kharchenko, observer for UNIAN </F>
(Ukrainian Independent Information News Agency), especially for 
"Biznes P-P": Six Against Inflation?] 
  [Text] On December 29 of last year the President signed a 
decree creating a commission concerned with the question of 
financial stabilization in Ukraine. This decree had the stamp 
"not subject to publication," and, although the news agencies 
rather quickly informed the public concerning the creation of 
this commission, all its subsequent activities have been veiled 
by secrecy and truly nothing "has been subject" to publication. 
  Certainly, no one today doubts the necessity of overcoming 
hyperinflation in Ukraine. From this standpoint the creation of 
a commission to develop a plan for financial preparations 
appears to be completely normal. As much as the appearance of 
this commission, structured as it is, is logical, there is a 
more complex question (members of the commission are the 
presidential adviser Valentyn Symonenko-the head of the 
commission, Mykola Syvulskyy deputy head of the agency for 
international cooperation and investment, Israeli ex-finance 
minister Itzak Moday, two entrepreneurs - Boris Hubskyy, the 
head of the center SLAVUTYCH and Viktor Medvedchuk, the 
president of the association of lawyers in Ukraine.) In the view 
of some professionals, what seems strange is that the commission 
contains no representatives of the Ministry of Finance or any 
professionals from the National Bank. But according to others 
this is precisely what the makeup of the commission should be - 
a minimum number of people (for productivity), a maximum of 
expertise and an almost obligatory presence in the commission of 
representatives of the executive departments. The last is not 
without sense: many economic reforms were prepared by one or 
more people, were enacted by a command, headed by a totally 
different person (according to some sources, the legendary 
Ludwig Erhard worked to the recommendations of two American 
economists). 
  There is a different problem, that of personalities. The 
riddle remains, for example, as to why Valentyn Symonenko was 
appointed head of the commission, a man who was not known for 
any prominent achievements as an expert on financial questions 
(obviously, in this case the President relied on his adviser as 
a person in whose bureaucratic talents he had full confidence). 
One member of the commission who is truly an authority on 
finances on the Ukrainian side is Mykola Syvulskyy. The 
appearance on the commission of Boris Hubskyy, Hryhoriy Surkis 
and Viktor Medvedchuk seems strange, in as much as, certainly 
not one of them until now has been known as a prominent 
financial expert. According to the words of one Ukrainian 
official, who considers himself as well informed, these people 
were included on the commission as practical men, who well 
understand the "loopholes" in the law, and how to circumvent 
them, and therefore can protect the program for financial 
stabilization against the appearance within the plan of such 
"loopholes." This argument is original, but it is necessary to 
admit the following: to compete with the above mentioned trio as 
with "practical men" is really quite complicated: how valuable 
is just the battle for the Kiev "Dynamo", won by Hryhoriy Surkis 
but not without the help of Viktor Medvedchuk, Borys Hubskyy and 
other business partners (after Viktor Bezverkhyy, president of 
the football club "Dynamo," emerged untouched from the scandal 
"on the level of Interpol," associated with the sale of Protasov 
and Lytovchenko, it seemed that no force could be found which 
would defeat him - but one was found, and it turned out to be 
Surkis and his partners). Besides that, one can speculate that 
this selection was not accidental, yet for another reason: 
Viktor Medvedchuk heads the Ukrainian-American-Israeli 
attorney's office of BIM; the makeup of the committee includes 
the ex-finance minister for Israel - therefore, evidently, this 
could also be a question of definite Israeli capital interests 
in Ukraine. 
  But, absolutely, the most interesting figure on the 
commission is the former Israeli finance minister Itzhak Moday. 
A man who has three advanced degrees (in engineering, 
jurisprudence, and economics), a highly qualified financier, 
Itzhak Moday acquired in Israel a reputation as a brilliant 
organizer. Becoming minister of finance in 1984, when inflation 
was coming close to 500 percent per year, he left the post in 
1986, when inflation was at 19 percent. During his second tenure 
in this position during 1990-1992, inflation was reduced from 18 
percent to just under 10 percent. As was recently reported by 
one of the influential Israeli newspapers "Maariv," in January 
of last year, on Itzhak Moday's 67th birthday, his former 
secretaries arranged a "surprise" party: on a huge cake was 
written "9.4 percent inflation - thank you. We have not 
forgotten." The fact that many other people in Israel "did not 
forget" the achievements of the minister is certified by the 
number of legends which are associated with his name. Ukrainian 
financiers have also been able to convince themselves of the 
exceptionally high professional level of the Israeli 
ex-minister. According to Viktor Yushchenko, head of the 
directorate of NBU [National Bank of Ukraine], only a few among 
those with whom he has had dealings have such a keen sense of 
financial problems, and can so brilliantly generate ideas in 
this area. 
  Thus, having united into one commission according to the 
directive of the President, these people were to develop, in a 
month and a half, a plan for the financial stabilization of 
Ukraine and give it to the President back in February. According 
to Mykola Syvulskyy, the members of the commission came together 
on the position that today's inflation in Ukraine cannot be 
subdued purely through monetary methods, that is, only through a 
severe restriction on the supply of money; a real effect must be 
induced by the policy of a steady reduction of inflation from 
month to month, at 5-10 percent, depending on the status that 
prevails in the production sector. The money supply is also to 
increase, confirms Mykola Syvulskyy, corresponding to the supply 
of goods in the market, but at the same time, not in proportion 
to the rise in prices (if you are to have, for example, a 
guideline of a monthly reduction in inflation by 40 percent, 
then the aim is to increase credit deposits by 30-35 percent). 
What the other steps are that have been included in the program, 
we were unable to determine either from Mykola Syvulskyy or from 
Itzhak Moday, nor from the other members of the commission, in 
that all of them believe that publication of the details of the 
program at least until the beginning of its implementation is 
premature. 
  How will the Israeli experience of overcoming inflation be 
adopted and what will be the role of Itzhak Moday in case the 
program is approved? It is not simple to give an answer to the 
first question in that the tactics announced by Mykola Syvulskyy 
do not totally match with the stabilization which took place in 
Israel during the years 1985-86. (As is known, the program of 
stabilization which entered history as the "plan of professor 
Bruno," first of all provided for a strict financial policy, a 
sharp reduction of the budget deficit, subsidies and privileges, 
and an increase in taxes against a background of a decrease in 
the real income of the populace. At the beginning of the reform, 
three way deals were made between the government, employers, and 
the trade unions according to which the trade unions temporarily 
halted strikes and were actually agreeing to the freezing of 
wages, the entrepreneurs were agreeing to the actual freezing of 
prices, the government took upon itself to control 90 percent of 
prices and to maintain the frozen exchange rate of the shekel at 
the same level (although it is true, not without the help of the 
USA in the form of 1.5 billion US dollars for the stabilization 
fund). Specifically due to such dynamics and strict methods, the 
country was able to knock down inflation to less than 20 percent 
per year and to reduce the price of credit on the world market 
from 880 percent to 53-55 percent.) Considering this, the role 
of the minister of the country that emerged from a crisis via 
such "silken" methods appears to be rather unique in the 
realization of a plan for a progressive surmounting of inflation 
in a different country. Considering the high professional level 
of the ex-minister of finance for Israel, one can suppose that 
he sees in our realities a basis for this. One thing which at 
the moment Ithzak Moday is emphasizing is the essential need for 
him to be personally present in Ukraine if the program is going 
to be carried out: "Economics - this is a living entity which 
reacts very sensitively to all changes. This is why the creator 
of the program needs to oversee his creation, in order to have 
the ability to make essential corrections and modifications to 
its behavior." 
  And the last question - what fate awaits the program? The 
answer will depend on how developments in parliament will 
unfold, who will join the government and who will head it. (It 
is interesting that three members of the commission - Mykola 
Syvulskyy, Viktor Medvedchuk, and Valentyn Symonenko - ran for 
the new parliament, but only Valentyn Symonenko succeeded). Thus 
the plan can be buried as easily as it was created, once again 
testifying to the simple truth that in Ukraine you can create as 
many programs as you wish, but this does not mean that they will 
mean anything in this country.

<F P=106> [Article by Mykola Petrushenko: "Miners No Longer Ask for </F>
Wages. After Meeting Representatives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy 
Rayon, Ukraine's President Ordered Creation of a Commission 
Which Is Obliged To Undertake Measures in Ten Days To Save the 
Coal Sector"] 
  [Text] Everyone remembers the miners' rebellions and 
strikes. The miners shook the government like a pear tree. And, 
they gained something for themselves. 
  It wasn't for the good life that representatives of one of 
the most difficult and essential professions left their jobs. 
And then, speaking of wages and improved working conditions, 
they hoped and believed that the government would really do 
something about the sector. Because without energy independence 
the young state cannot develop normally. 
  But the government quenched the conflict without getting 
into 
the root causes. By hook or crook they managed to raise wages in 
the mines. But the government's measures had no effect on the 
main thing--stabilization of the operation of the sector. Now it 
is on the verge of collapse. This was stated by representatives 
of labor collectives of Donbass's Tsentralnyy Rayon at a meeting 
with Ukraine President L. Kravchuk. 
  What's the problem? Payment failures have paralyzed 
production. Since the start of the year, the mines have not been 
paid 3 trillion karbovantsy [Ukrainian rubles] for coal shipped. 
  Under these conditions, naturally, the mines can't even 
maintain production. And in order to boost production, new mine 
faces have to be opened. But there's no money. The work front is 
declining, as is the motivation to work. 
  "It all started with talk about the market," said O. 
Kalfakheyan sadly (he's the general director of 
Dzerzhynskvuhillya Association). "We have state orders, but we 
get nothing for state prices. The businessmen are living off the 
state and the working people. We have nothing to work with, the 
sector has been artificially paralyzed." 
  L. Kravchuk: 
  "What do you suggest to get out of the crisis?" 
  "The state needs to extend credit." 
  "What will it be spent on?" 
  "Settling our debts." 
  After that brief dialogue, there was a pause in the meeting. 
Extending credit means settling the debts of the past; there are 
nonpayments for 1992 and 1993. How are people to live now? 
  There is no easy answer. One good thing, however, is that 
the 
fault of the state for the sector's problems was acknowledged. 
And the next step was taken: the government cannot just put out 
the fire, it has to draw up an integrated plan to solve the 
sector's crisis. In the presence of the miners, L. Kravchuk 
created a commission to study the situation and draw up specific 
proposals. It is supposed to submit a concrete program of action 
in 10 days. 
  Everything seems to be fine and logical. But I should like 
to 
make this comment. None of the troubles in the coal sector, 
which is so essential to Ukraine's economy, took shape 
overnight. The government failed to act. 
  The idea of meeting with the miners didn't come up on the 
day 
of the meeting, either. Hence, the commission could have been 
created earlier so that its proposals could have been discussed 
at the meeting, but this was not done. Time is being lost, and 
problems are getting worse. We don't seem to know how to look 
ahead. We operate on the principle, "The peasant doesn't cross 
himself until he hears the thunder."

<F P=106> [Article by Alla Nosova: "Perhaps Metallurgists Are Not </F>
Against Conversion to Joint Stock Company Status. The Only Thing 
Is, Will the Present Board of Directors Own Enterprises if 
Workers Can Only Buy 7 to 9 Percent of the Shares?"] 
  [Text] This question did not get much attention, because it 
was slipped in near the end of Ukraine President L. Kravchuk's 
meeting with the directors of the 14 biggest metallurgy 
enterprises in the country. But it was shoved "under the 
curtain" by the voices of numerous concerned people. And a 
mechanism was proposed for ensuring that "90 percent of the 
shares do not end up in the hands of outsiders." In response, 
Industry Minister Anatoliy Holubchenko promised that he had 
arranged with the State Property Fund to reserve 30 to 40 
percent of the shares for further buy-out. But the audience 
hooted that bit of information down too. Clearly, people sensed 
that the powerful directors' corps would like to become 
enterprise owners almost automatically. 
  In general the meeting was planned to check up on previous 
agreements on ways to revive the sector. From Minister A. 
Holubchenko's report it was clear that the greatest worries are 
the status of gas payments, trade with Russia and the other CIS 
countries, and currency regulation; there was particular focus 
on shortcomings in the buying and selling of currency for 
tenders. Unquestionably, this meeting brought together old 
directors, to be sure, but they were discussing how to solve the 
problems that have arisen during the time of market reforms. 
Right now, the metallurgy complex is 640 million dollars short 
of enough to pay for gas. The proposal was made to change the 
decision regarding compulsory sales of 50 percent of the 
enterprises' hard currency earnings to the state, and to sell 
only 25 percent. And 75 percent is enough to pay for gas and to 
buy essential equipment. 
  A tough future is in store for metallurgical enterprises 
which have already, essentially, halted production owing to 
mutual indebtedness. Participants in the meeting also talked 
about note settlements as a panacea for all economic ills. But 
in fact they do not work. As yet, a mechanism for introducing 
them is not fully in place. Mutual mistrust of these papers is 
apparent both on the part of buyers and sellers. Whatever the 
future may bring, notes will have to be introduced. 
  One cause of the slowdown in trade with Russia is that 
sometimes that country sells its raw materials to our producers 
at prices that are higher than world prices. The cost of raw 
materials boosts the cost of products. This then is the root of 
indicator prices whose use the directors called criminal. But 
the objection can be made that sometimes they sell the same 
product to Russia more cheaply than in Ukraine. 
  Some directors spoke in thinly veiled fashion about seceding 
from their Industry Ministry. That question is one that has yet 
to be discussed. 
  The only thing is, why are discussions about problems like 
these held by the production council in the presence of the 
President?

<F P=106> [Article by Yaroslav Khobta: "Signs of Spring Have Appeared </F>
at the End of May in Ukraine's Relations With the World"] 
  [Text] In the spring of 1994 Ukraine began a massive 
advertising campaign to create a positive image of itself in the 
world. An unexpected shock for world observers was the March 
indicator of the inflation rate for the karbovanets. This figure 
amounted to 5.6 percent, whereas at the start of the year it had 
been higher by several orders of magnitude. The very tough 
monetary policy introduced by Zvyahilskyy, after several months 
of hand-wringing, has only now begun to lose its funereal 
colors. Only now--in the observers's opinion--have the 
presidential edicts and the decrees adopted by the Cabinet of 
Ministers as well as the National Bank taken on a quality of 
logic and purposiveness. 
  Of course, this could not fail to have a marked effect on 
Ukraine's foreign relations with the most influential circles in 
the West. It's most likely that the West has ceased to blink in 
astonishment after each new item of information from Ukraine. To 
be sure, investors who have already invested their U.S. dollars, 
German marks, and other such hard currency here are still 
grasping their heads, but they are no longer spitting in all 
directions and cursing the day when their money crossed our 
border. The packet of privileges for investors which was 
proclaimed by the president of Ukraine prior to 1 April has not 
yet attained the status of an April Fools joke; and under our 
conditions even this can be considered an achievement. In 
commenting upon the course of economic reforms during the spring 
period, certain analysts have expressed the opinion that the 
liberalization of the economy is directly linked to the 
elections. But--on the other hand--if nobody is worse off 
because of this, then what is the difference as to when the 
reforms were conducted--during the elections, before them, or 
after them? In essence, the West began to take a new attitude 
toward Ukraine after Kravchuk's visit to the White House in 
Washington. The granting of assistance to Ukraine by the United 
States in the amount of 700 million U.S. dollars (which exceeded 
the previously allocated total several times over) served as a 
unique guarantee not only for the governments of other 
countries, but also for potential investors. And although right 
now the situation in Ukraine is far from being what such 
investors would have wanted, they have 
all--nevertheless--reached the conclusion that we are not to be 
deserted. And if tens of millions more must be poured into our 
country today, then tomorrow or the day after tomorrow we will 
begin to yield some profits. And just where are we headed now? 
  According to data provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of 
Statistics, as of 1 April 1994, the growth of investments in 
Ukraine's economy during the period from January through March 
of this year reached the figure of 66.7 million U.S. dollars. At 
the beginning of 1994 the total amount of investments in Ukraine 
had reached the level of 1.2-1.5 billion U.S. dollars. However, 
according to data provided by the Cabinet of Ministers, we need 
to employ four times that total in order to carry out our 
top-priority tasks in the immediate future. The legal foundation 
for investors in Ukraine is still the Decree passed by the 
Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers dated 20 May 1993, "On the System 
of Foreign Investment." In line with this Decree, the Law "On a 
State Program for Encouraging Foreign Investments" was passed in 
December 1993; it designated 11 high-priority sectors for 
investing in our economy. Furthermore, Ukraine has just recently 
introduced several more legislative acts aimed at encouraging 
foreign investments here. To sum up, the West will continue to 
have a sentimental attitude toward us until such time as we 
ourselves cease to have a sentimental attitude toward the West. 
  But, meanwhile, this spring the world's financial 
institutions have significantly stepped up their scrutiny of the 
conditions for granting credits to Ukraine. On 19 May the 
mission of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] completed its 
work, the goal of which was to standardize the conditions under 
which Ukraine could be granted the so-called STF (Standard 
Transformation Facilities)--credits amounting to 700 million 
U.S. dollars, keyed to a period of 15 years at interest rates of 
6 or 7 percent percent per annum. As a rule, the IMF grants STF 
to countries with a transitional type of economy for the purpose 
of amortizing the deficits in their budget payments. Of course, 
it would have been best if--during this visit--the Ukrainian 
government had prepared a letter to the IMF, in which a method 
of putting such credits to advantageous use could have been set 
forth, although even this cannot be regarded as a panacea. In 
the words of Lorenzo de Milnera, the IMF's permanent 
representative in Ukraine, one of the mandatory conditions for 
granting STF to Ukraine is political stability in our country; 
this would manifest itself--first and foremost--in the existence 
of "solid persons" in positions of authority. And, therefore, it 
can be safely predicted that--in any case--the IMF is waiting 
for the election results. 
  A discussion of the global initiatives with regard to 
granting assistance to Ukraine--initiatives which were set forth 
several weeks ago by the Commission of the European 
Union--recently took place in Brussels at the level of the 
ambassadors from the 12 member-states of the EU [European 
Union]. The specific total figure for such assistance was not 
revealed, but Great Britain's ambassador noted the importance of 
the proposals set forth by the Commission, and the EU 
Commission's official representative--Peter Gilford--hinted that 
the problem of assisting Ukraine Ukraine would not remain in the 
corridors of power at Brussels. In contrast to the United 
States, Canada, and other trans-oceanic investors, the EU is 
more disturbed by Ukraine's nuclear problem and--in 
particular--by the question of the Chernobyl AES [nuclear power 
station]. Specifically because of this, Western Europe is still 
dancing about in its interrelations with Ukraine. This matter is 
to be discussed during the course of the meetings between the 
leaders of the "Big Seven" states in June 1994; and Ukraine will 
be practically the first country to feel the results of these 
discussions. 
  Quite a good result of the final accord among Ukrainian 
politicians reached on 17 May was a "first" in the history of 
the relations between Washington and Kiev. This was the signing 
by U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry and Ukrainian Deputy 
Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov of an agreement on cooperation in 
the sphere of converting military-type production. An agreement 
to create the Ukrainian-American Westron JV [joint venture] was 
signed at the highest level. It is the first substantive proof 
that Ukraine's relations with the United States have entered 
upon an entirely new stage of development. All this gives us 
occasion to consider that--in the very near future--Ukraine can 
anticipate the first wave in our memory of ardent, assiduous 
attention from the world's financial giants. But on one 
condition: that we stop spitting into our own well.

<F P=106> [Interview with Suren Harutyunyan, former first secretary of </F>
the Armenian Communist Party, by Ruben Hayrabedyan in Moscow; 
date not specified] 
  [Excerpts] After his voluntary departure Suren Harutyunyan, 
the former first secretary of the Central Committee of the 
Armenian Communist Party, avoided any interviews with the 
republic's press. He did not wish to cast any shadow on the 
leadership of the republic or to play any destabilizing role in 
Armenia's political affairs. However, recently various rumors 
began to spread about him, some approaching the proportions of 
absurdity. First they said, to Harutyunyan's surprise, that he 
is a leading representative of Russian-American business (let us 
say that he goes to work at the Russian Foreign Ministry by 
metro). Then they linked his name with the leader of one of the 
factions of the Armenian Pannational Movement [APM]. Then they 
accused him of being a renegade within the Armenian Communist 
Party. When I called Harutyunyan to ask for an interview, he 
said that he considers it below his dignity to answer those 
charges, adding: "I have been in politics for too long to 
respond to them." However, he is prepared to talk and express 
his thoughts about Armenia, the destiny of his people and the 
most recent period of its history. 
  [Passage omitted] 
  [Hayrabedyan] Now it is possible to hear in Armenia 
"diatribes" that if Harutyunyan had been more decisive, the 
opposition would not have assumed power and thus would not cause 
so much damage to the people with the mismanagement it has 
demonstrated in its administration of the state and would not 
have turned a prosperous republic into ruins. 
  [Harutyunyan] They acted "more decisively" in Georgia and 
Azerbaijan, and what happened? The fact that no blood was shed 
in the explosive environment of those days and things did not 
escalate into a civil war, was principally an accomplishment of 
Armenia's leadership at that time and not that of the 
opposition, as it is often portrayed. The latter approached 
matters with the principle of "the worse it gets the better it 
is for us" and tried to provoke the authorities. Recall the 
sieges laid to buildings during the meetings of the Supreme 
Soviet, the acts of violence against some deputies and so forth. 
One cannot enumerate all of them. There were many opportunities 
to use forceful methods. But deliberately we did not resort to 
such steps to avoid creating in the republic a conflict 
situation with tragic consequences. On the other hand I should 
not conceal the fact that they put much pressure on me from 
Moscow and in Yerevan to undertake the "decisive" steps you 
mentioned. I can only imagine how they would condemn me then and 
now if I had used force. [passage omitted] 
  [Hayrabedyan] Mr Harutyunyan, let us now discuss a very 
sensitive subject: Armenia's independence. You were the 
republic's leader when it was under "Russia's yoke" and when 
Russia was "plundering our national treasures" and was 
"trampling" over our national feelings and so forth. We were 
able to win that independence, and now we are running from it as 
if it was the plague. And where do we run? Overwhelmingly to the 
detested "imperialist Russia." It always seemed to me that, 
given our geographical location and limited resources 
(especially energy), Armenia would be the last to leave the 
USSR--it had to. Please tell me how you view Armenia's 
independence. 
  [Harutyunyan] I welcome the independence of our fatherland. 
The independence of any nation deserves respect. On the other 
hand when I look at today's poor Armenia, I begin to wonder 
whether this is what the struggle was for, whether this is what 
every Armenian dreamed of and whether everything was done 
correctly. To be frank, I have thought at great length about 
these issues and I have always always been told that I have a 
cautious approach with regard to the concept of independence for 
Armenia. As a consequence of my work, I knew well the republic, 
its capabilities and means and I often asked myself whether we 
can survive on our own. There is no need to look too far. Only 
18 percent of our raw material needs came from local sources. 
Our entire supply of fuel, iron, and was imported. We imported 
80 percent of materials needed for light industry. Our domestic 
farm production accounted for 25 percent of our grain needs, 39 
percent of dairy needs and 60 percent of the meat we needed. One 
can enumerate such numbers ad infinitum. 
  [Hayrabedyan] Yes, but did not the proponents of 
independence 
know about that? If they did, what did they rely on? 
  [Harutyunyan] You should ask that question to them. If you 
add to what I said the unreliability of our surroundings and the 
lack of any access to open seas, then you find yourself facing 
an unpromising situation. It is wonderful when you achieve peace 
and prosperity with independence. Independence is preferable 
even when the situation does not get any worse. But when life 
turns into a complete hell and when tens of thousands of people 
are forced to flee the promised land... 
  This automatically leads to the question: How did Armenia, 
the prosperous republic of not so long ago, end up in a pit of 
disasters? Do we not guilty when we seek self-sufficiency and 
when our own resources are highly exaggerated? The lessons of 
the last few years, as bitter as they may be, are very 
instructive for our people. Hrant Matevosyan is right when he 
writes: "Today we are settling old scores with the empire, but 
was it not that empire that fed and clothed us? Did we not smile 
and laugh? Were we not happy with our lives? Were we not in 
charge of our lives?" 
  [Hayrabedyan] At a recent anniversary ceremony in Moscow 
[poet and activist] Silva Kaputikyan said bitterly that 
evidently the people can also make mistakes. 
  [Harutyunyan] The truth is that winning independence is 
completely different from demonstrating it. How can you arouse 
the people and fight for an idea when you do not know how you 
can realize it and when you do not have a more or less realistic 
program for national development. I repeat: I am also attracted 
to the idea of an independent national state, but I knew well 
that political independence without economic independence is a 
hollow notion. 
  [Hayrabedyan] For 70 years we said that Armenia cannot exist 
without Russia. Then, over the course of a few months, we 
"proved" unexpectedly that we can live better without the 
Russians. After all, "we have cognac, mineral water, and we are 
a talented people." There were even threats uttered against 
Russia. You have held leadership positions in Moscow and 
Yerevan. You know the domain of relations between the two 
countries well. What is the place of Russia in our nation's 
destiny? 
  [Harutyunyan] "Having been liberated" from Russia we now 
turn 
to it--let us be candid--with begging hands. In the past we 
demanded even more. Could the well-fed and satisfied Armenian of 
Soviet Armenia ever contemplate going into exile? Today a 
degradation of the nation is under way. Its character is 
changing. We are losing our national dignity. We are becoming 
uninvited guests and making our hosts nervous. 
  I think that Armenia must have good relations first with its 
neighbors, including Turkey, and it must have strong ties with 
Europe and the United States. However, every small nation must 
have its supremacies [as published] in its geopolitics. Whether 
we like it or not, we are condemned to be together with the 
Russians. I think that in the aftermath of the events of the 
last few years we realized once again Russia's role in the 
protection of Armenia's independence. To me this is very natural 
and does not need additional proof. In that context, I would 
like to say the following: I am terrified by even the 
theoretical possibility that what happened to the USSR may 
happen to Russia--that is the disintegration of that country. 
With whom will we be left then? Every Armenian must think about 
that. [passage omitted] 
  [Hayrabedyan] Do you not think that in Armenia there are 
forces that wish to discredit you in order to isolate you from 
the republic's political life? 
  [Harutyunyan] I feel very comfortable with regard to 
everything that is undertaken around my name. It would be 
surprising if my person were viewed unequivocally, perhaps for 
the simple reason that I had the task of governing the republic 
during an extremely critical period. However, it is another 
matter when there is inserious talk. Being unwilling to rise 
above their unrealized ambitions, my opponents sink to the 
cheapest levels of defamation. Experience shows that the "most 
demanding" critics are those who demand the impossible from 
others because they do not know what to do and how to do it. 
  [Hayrabedyan] What would you say about Armenia's Communist 
Party? In general how do you view your past? Do you try to erase 
it? 
  [Harutyunyan] The Armenian Communist Party was in a deep 
crisis in as early as 1988. It had been weakened in an 
organizational and political sense. But that was not a 
phenomenon that occurred in Armenia alone. The entire Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union was sick. The course that events took 
not only in Armenia but also across the entire Soviet Union can 
largely be explained by that phenomenon. 
  Today, the Armenian Communist Party is being rebuilt on new 
foundations. I believe that it has quite promising capabilities 
to influence the process of extricating the republic from the 
jaws of this brutal crisis. My posture with regard to the work 
of the Communist Party as well as that of the other political 
parties in Armenia is one of supreme respect. I would only 
caution that a wave of orthodoxy does not overtake the Communist 
Party, especially given the fact that it is operating in the 
especially peculiar conditions of Armenia's reality. 
  As for my past, we learn lessons from the past. What has 
happened is my life, and I would not run away from it under any 
circumstances. 
  [Hayrabedyan] So, Mr Harutyunyan, what do we have today? We 
have a fatherland with a ruined economy, a population that is on 
the brink of bankruptcy and despair and horrifying levels of 
unemployment. Meanwhile the war goes on, and the country 
continues to lose intellectuals and entrepreneurs. The people 
are completely depoliticized. How can they live? What must be 
done? 
  [Harutyunyan] It is useless to make any predictions, given 
Armenia's current situation. I would not want to come across as 
a self-proclaimed strategist who watches the battle from the 
sidelines. I have met not too few such individuals. The present 
Armenian authorities have made many mistakes and have many 
flaws. On the other hand, I understand the objective 
difficulties that loom before our nation and the leadership of 
our republic. 
  There are many critics, but constructive approaches are 
missing. Today there are more questions than answers. The 
principal weakness of the present opposition is precisely that 
it, too, cannot answer the question "What is the way out?" Today 
there is an evident struggle for survival in the land of 
Armenians. Obviously everyone is doing that the best way he can. 
But we cannot be saved individually. I sympathize with those 
people who believe that a pannational program to extricate 
ourselves from the current impasse is our principal task. 
Armenia is stepping into the 21st century without a planned 
national program. The incompetence of Armenia's political mind 
is discouraging. 
  In the present circumstances I support not the division of 
the public but its unity and national consensus. Today none of 
the Armenian political parties have the ability to extricate the 
country from its crisis. It is essential to bring together all 
patriotic forces and to form a united broad-based front for 
national salvation. The condition of the republic sometimes 
appears to be insurmountable. Even so, I am convinced that the 
country may be reborn and joy may come to the Armenian hearth. 
The only thing that is necessary is that that hope and belief 
does not die out in the heart and mind of every Armenian.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Armies and Battlefronts Cannot Be Run with </F>
Roundups"] 
  [Text] What is happening today in the capital's streets, 
roads, bus and metro stations, markets and coffee shops is 
beyond anyone's imagination. Classic Armenian disorganization 
and cottage-industry and self-enterprise mentality could not 
have taken a worse form than the means that have been "selected" 
for the organization of the current conscription drive. At 
virtually every step men, especially young ones, are targeted 
for roundups that use the crudest methods: force, brutality and 
disparagement. What is being done behind slogans of defending 
the fatherland and mobilizing the army is discrediting the 
entire essence of this worthy program. As a result, neither the 
army can be properly mobilized nor can the defense of the 
borders of the fatherland become more sound. Instead, fear, 
panic and demoralization may overtake people's minds, perhaps in 
an irreversible manner. 
  What is most disturbing, however, is not the roundups but 
the 
mistrust which follows them. In the past few days, our office 
has received numerous reports that the individuals who are in 
charge of these "operations" rob and plunder indiscriminately 
everyone--those who are liable as well as those who are not 
liable for military service--with insatiable enthusiasm. Our 
information about the seizure of cash and jewelry and the 
collection of bribes in American dollars has already gone beyond 
the limits of rumors. Strong protests are heard especially from 
those who cannot afford to "liberate" their kin, because they 
think that if they had the means their sons and husbands would 
not be taken to the army and that the defense of the army would 
not have turned into a "merchants'" business. 
  Yes, mistrust rules everywhere, and the minister of state 
responsible for defense [Vazgen Sargsyan] could not dispel that 
mistrust with his well-known television address. He could not 
dispel it by presenting the conscription drive as a personal, 
almost private, task to the people without taking into account 
Armenia's morale and psychological state, the socioeconomic 
condition of the people, the presence of foreign influences that 
corrupt the young, the natural fear of military service and 
especially the political capital that the ruling group has lost 
amongst the people. 
  Since there is no organization or press organ which opposes 
a 
strong army and a sound defense, an important task such as the 
conscription drive should have been arranged pannationally as 
befits a state in a truly organized and professional manner with 
the appropriate propaganda. 
  Otherwise, with the current foul means we can have neither a 
combat-ready army nor a sound defense.

<F P=106> [Article by Khosrov Arutyunyan and Yuriy Grigoryan: "Is </F>
Collapse Being Programmed?"] 
  [Text] Two opposite structures of the economy may 
quite definitely be distinguished: the state structure, with its 
centralized production and distribution system, and the 
decentralized structure, where relationships are formed "at the 
bottom" by the originally market, spontaneous path. There is no 
doubt that the self-organized society is more progressive than 
the artificially structured one. But the industrial potential 
that took shape in past decades rejects market spontaneity, and 
the transition process has been conditioned by contradictory 
trends. Nonetheless, we have yet to see the harmonious 
combination of these extreme forms in a single government 
program. The dominant idea is the market, and merely when it 
reduces to crisis a sector that has succumbed to reform are 
backward steps taken in order to stabilize if only the low level 
of the economy, as was the case with industry in 1993, but 
subsequently the same type of alterations with, it has to be 
assumed, a new spiraling of collapse are programmed. That is, as 
long as a choice between different directions is possible, the 
leadership of the republic will opt for a path at the end of 
which we will find ourselves in an extraordinarily difficult 
situation with just one, nondiscretional, way out. And the 
forced measures are, as a rule, the former rejected methods of 
management, in their worst version, what is more. Swings between 
two polar-opposite approaches were clearly manifested, for 
example, in the program of socioeconomic development for the 
present year that has been drawn up by the government. Let us 
take the measures to stabilize prices and increase the 
well-being of society. As was to have been expected, control and 
prohibitory methods are prevalent here: government price 
control, a ban on the sale of foreign currency, a fuel price 
fork, restrictions of currency exchange, and so forth. But 
prohibitory campaigns even in the times of the command economy 
amounted in the initial demonstration period more often than not 
to selective repressive measures and, on the whole, merely 
engendered new problems. The method most beloved of our 
government is, it would seem, being taken from the arsenal of 
the state's regulatory influence on the market: commodity and 
dram intervention. With a well-computed quantity and precisely 
chosen time and place it does, possibly, have the desired 
effect. But if the measures are adopted inopportunely? Several 
attempts by the government to knock down prices in the market 
were condemned to fail from the very outset since, first, the 
action was mounted when the high prices had already taken hold; 
second, and this is particularly important, the quantity of the 
commodity that was poured out was so small as to have been 
unable to have had any powerful impact. The market did not even 
notice the flea-bite, but some people made out pretty well. More 
sober-minded people proposed simply selling the available stocks 
to the needy, and they were right. One-time interventions of a 
commodity, as of currency also, make sense as a calming 
influence given incidental outpourings and perturbations of the 
state of the market, but not as a means of rectification of a 
constantly intensifying crisis. It is necessary once again here 
to immediately combat the cause, not the effect. It is the 
economic policy of recent years that we have to thank first and 
foremost for the inconceivable deterioration in the well-being 
of the population of the republic, the shortage of basic 
necessities, the jacked-up prices, and the decline in the value 
of the dram. We could have avoided all this or have experienced 
it in a more tolerable form had the ill-considered price 
liberalization not been implemented, had there not been the 
accelerated winding down of state trade, had the sweeping 
privatization of agriculture not been undertaken, and had the 
state not begun hastily to rid itself of the leadership of 
industry. 
  But let us examine these matters individually. 
<H5>  Price Policy </H5>
  Price liberalization will continue. Certain measures of 
control and regulation will affect merely a very limited list of 
commodities, but commodities and services at fixed prices will 
be made available to the whole population. 
  In our view, these are fundamentally mistaken measures. The 
point being that the formation of prices is genetically 
conditioned by the form of economic system. If it is basically 
composed of an aggregate of self-sufficient independent works, 
the natural form of the exchange of commodities is the market 
with a completely unrestricted price system. If, on the other 
hand, a state-organized production system operates, the price of 
a product is both coordinated and regulated by the state. 
  With a mixed economy, pricing should reflect the predominant 
system of production. Both command intervention in the price 
relationships of private manufacturers and liberalization with 
the prevalence of the public sector are equally wrong (unless we 
are talking about special cases, of course). 
  The state can merely maintain low prices for consumer goods 
in order to bring them into line with the established minimum 
wage. But this privilege cannot be extended to all, since income 
and remuneration in the private sector are of a market nature. 
  Now, when the dance of prices is in full swing, and they are 
subject to the influence of the vast market of Russia and, 
partially, of the world market also, the state is required for 
the purpose of the stabilization of production and the social 
condition of part of the populace (whose income depends on the 
state and is for this reason less labile) to regulate in the 
public sector exchange, price relationships. It is necessary 
particularly to harmonize with the minimum wage the prices of a 
vitally necessary set of commodities and services, with their 
identical periodic indexation. In a number of instances it is 
more convenient to have prices tied to the market index, but to 
compensate them by subsidy. In order to successfully influence 
the market and regulate its prices, it is essential to bring the 
relative value of the consumer merchandise presented for sale by 
the state into line with the generated state product's share of 
the gross national product. Barter exchange, clearing, and state 
trade are perfectly capable of securing this proportion. 
<H5>  Trade, the Market </H5>
  It is hard to provide any rational explanation for the fact 
that a working person in receipt of wages established on the 
basis of his labor in the public sector, where the bulk of the 
wealth of the republic is created, is supplied with goods in the 
marketplace, for here the tradesmen have put the price of his 
labor on the level of that of a laying hen. We can hardly be 
satisfied here with the explanation that it is easiest to 
privatize subjects of trade, and this is why the state has rid 
itself of the last component in the "commodity-money" system. 
The last instance of the movement of money has come to be in the 
hands of businessmen, and so it is they who hold sway over 
everything. The government is on the one hand devising special 
measures to stabilize prices and the dram and to restore the 
well-being of society and, on the other, never having understood 
cause and effect, evidently, is blessing that same policy of the 
privatization of trade. 
  It is hard not to see the harm of such an act. 
First, we have acquired a distorted economy. It is 
based predominantly on a state system of production, and at the 
level of exchange, something akin to a market with some 
arbitrarily established commodity prices. A market economy has 
not eventuated, all the same, nor could it have. For this it is 
essential to have a certain number, meaningful in the overall 
system of production, of noninterconnected independent 
enterprises. Trade is not creating them. 
  Second, the production-consumption chain, into 
which a mass of businessmen, more often than not simply 
profiteers and swindlers, has been squeezed, has been 
artificially extended. The super-profits that they obtain have 
served to increase prices. The remuneration of the direct 
producer has become meager compared with the income of those 
who, following a series of exchanges, sell to them the product 
of their labor. The coffers of the state, which has voluntarily 
given away its auriferous vein, are empty. The population is 
starving. 
  Third, There has been a shift of stimulus of the 
activity of the entrepreneurs. Everyone has made a dash for 
trade, where it is possible to get rich without any particular 
effort. It has swallowed up, all else aside, human business 
capital also. 
  Fourth, against the background of the virtually 
constant decline in production, a small group of people is 
becoming incredibly wealthy. The negligible good things that are 
still being created ultimately become the spoils of nimble smart 
operators who are very far removed from production, but who are 
dexterously availing themselves of the current situation. 
Personal income is concentrated in their hands. The structure of 
consumption is being distorted. The product of light industry, 
which could cover a considerable proportion of the national 
currency that has been issued, is going begging on account of 
the exorbitantly inflated prices of the products necessary for 
people's existence. In order to maintain the circulation of cash 
and drams, the government has been forced to switch its 
attention to the requirements of the latter-day nouveaux riches. 
They are interested least of all in investment in industry. You 
can indulge them with jewelry and foreign currency, which the 
government does from time to time, lest the dram be strangled at 
birth. 
  The stabilization of the dram in January, which was an 
object 
of the unconcealed pride of the government, was secured by 
several measures: a delay in payments to the public, the sale of 
foodstuffs via state trade, a ban on the sale of currency, and 
currency intervention. The first measure in fact signified a 
reduction in personal income, which is simply impermissible. 
Prohibitory and control measures are ineffective, and currency 
is urgently needed for more important things. There remains, as 
a method for the future, state trade, but it is this that the 
program for 1994 assigns merely an auxiliary role for a sporadic 
impact on jacked-up prices. 
  It is time to conclude the flawed market game. An 
alternative 
policy in the sphere of trade should consist of the state taking 
control of just as much of it as is necessary for the form of 
exchange to be brought into line with the form of production. It 
is possible to this end to organize the sale of a prudently 
limited quantity of basic necessities exclusively to employees 
of the public sector and to persons in receipt of a payment from 
public funds in a fixed per capita amount, with regard to their 
dependent underage children. To appoint for the corresponding 
organizations wholly subordinate stores and distribution 
outlets. Commodities purchased on a clearing or barter basis and 
via state trade without parasitical middlemen would be priced 
considerably below the market. This path would permit the social 
protection of the populace against mistakes of the reforms that 
are being undertaken, the enhancement and balance of consumer 
demand, consolidation of the position of the dram, and the 
preservation of foreign currency. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  When the land was being exultantly distributed to the 
peasants, it was believed, evidently, that the sense of 
ownership would signify a growth of the productivity of rural 
labor to the level of the private farms of the West, almost, but 
no thought was given to the fact that the farmer is merely a 
link in an integral system of the production, shipment, 
processing, and sale of agricultural produce. All components of 
the system--be they the creation and servicing of equipment, the 
supply of chemical agents, or transport, marketing, or 
consultation services--operate in strictly interconnected 
fashion. The farmer has only to be squeezed out of this system, 
and, despite the astonishing degree of provision with equipment, 
production begins to decline sharply. What is to be expected of 
our peasant, whom we gave a piece of land and whom with delight 
and an expectation of gratitude we ejected from the former 
agro-industrial complex? He is no longer in a position to feed 
not so much several dozen people, as the farmer of developed 
countries is, but even the requisite dozen people, given the 
current ratio of the population of town and country. The 
disruption of the infrastructure and rural production has been 
the cause not only of a diminution in the volume of the 
agricultural product, but also of a considerable increase in its 
cost on account of the excrescence of intermediate service 
components. The farmstead cannot get the better of the middlemen 
fleecing it and is sliding toward subsistence farming. Last 
year, when the situation had become critical, the government was 
forced to take a step toward the former methods, making 
available to the countryside services at acceptable fixed 
prices. But in the program for 1994 it is proposing a directly 
opposite solution: the priority privatization of facilities of 
the agricultural infrastructure. It has to be assumed that this 
was more a political than an economic decision. 
  With the alternative approach, the brunt of the servicing of 
rural labor is to be assumed by the state, the mistakes of the 
ill-considered privatization of the land being rectified hereby. 
Inasmuch as the peasant is now a proprietor, it is necessary to 
work out a form of settlement with him, making clearing on the 
strength of the actual or future agricultural product the basis. 
It is necessary to give thought to a series of measures for 
modernization of the countryside, create in vacant areas 
specialized farms, model animal husbandry and poultry-breeding 
units included, step up advisory services, and provide for 
material backing for progressive techniques on favorable terms. 
And the principal method of settlement between the rural worker 
and the state should be the product of rural labor in absolute 
or (in certain cases) relative values, what is more. 
<H5>  Industry </H5>
  The slight stabilization of industry in 1993 was achieved 
thanks to centralized methods of management. Nonetheless, 
government policy, to judge by the program that has been 
presented, will be sustained in the previous reform style. It 
has been shown quite convincingly, it would seem, that the 
relatively developed industrial economic system of Armenia may 
function only with high organization linking all its components. 
Until self-formed internal relations have taken shape, they 
should be predetermined from outside, by central management. 
Otherwise, a collapse of the system affecting all its components 
will begin. But despite the obvious destructive phenomena, the 
policy of transformations remains invariable: On the one hand, 
the program provides for huge outlays on defense industry, the 
non-revenue-producing infrastructure, grants and subsidies to 
the countryside, loans to entrepreneurs, and on social needs, 
and, on the other, privatization and denationalization such as 
will ultimately signify a dissipation of resources and a further 
decline in production and, consequently, in receipts for the 
treasury will be undertaken. Such reform will also harm, for 
that matter, progress toward the goal for the sake of which it 
is being undertaken: the creation of a developed capitalist 
economy. First, the economic environment in which any 
enterprise, private included, can exist and operate will be 
destroyed. Second, funds that could be channeled into the 
allocation of credit to enterprise will be irretrievably lost. 
Third, the range of persons comprehending under the actual 
conditions problems of production and marketing will be limited. 
Instead of artificial "incubators" of business, the state has an 
opportunity to have a school of management at the enterprises 
themselves, attracting to them those who wish to show in 
business of what they are capable. 
  The reform actions of the government amount mainly to 
privatization. It is notable that no document giving the 
go-ahead for privatization adduces economic justification of the 
benefit of this step or criteria of an evaluation of its 
consequences and the economic conditions and circumstances 
permitting or prohibiting the transfer of title of a specific 
facility. Merely a trend toward an order of priority of 
privatization is noticeable. Components of at times a global 
sector or sphere are being pulled into it, with a consistent 
switch from the lower stories of the economic system to the 
upper stories. Trade, agriculture, infrastructure, and small 
light industry enterprises, subsequently the rest also. In 
addition, it may be observed that preference in the order of 
priority is being given "weak," unprofitable enterprises, which 
is why the stimulus of a temporizing deterioration in their 
activity has begun to operate. Either the principle of easiness 
or of rapid turnover. 
  A nonpoliticized attitude toward privatization should be 
based exclusively on the economic utility of each individual 
act. A set of criteria whose fulfillment could guarantee 
salutary consequences of a change in the form of ownership 
should be formulated. Specifically, inasmuch as the economy 
represents a multilevel interconnected system, from which it is 
impossible to remove in full any level without appreciable 
damage to the remaining and to the detached parts, it would make 
more sense to reduce the centralized pyramid system, severing it 
the length of the vertical line and thereby preserving the 
possibility of its stable operation. 
  The principle of the redemption of the fixed capital only 
for 
the surplus product of an enterprise or for profit obtained 
thanks to the use of the production capacity granted its 
unrestricted enjoyment could be another criterion. Only the work 
force, management, or individual that by their labor, expanding 
and modernizing production, are able to show the prospects of 
the transfer to them of a given facility would deserve to become 
owners of state property. Several supplementary requirements 
would create an incentive to the labor, not the inaction, of the 
existing enterprises. 
  In line with privatization, the public sector would be 
painlessly constricted, the sphere of market management being 
expanded. The transitional period could be considered complete 
when private capital investments cater in full for the further 
development of the economy--the level of self-sustaining growth. 
  The adduced analysis of the government program has proceeded 
from the fundamental principles of the formation of an economic 
system and has attempted to reveal the strategy of the proposed 
methods. More than a year ago an author of these lines--then 
prime minister--raised before parliament the global issue of the 
direction of the reform policy. Unfortunately, the Supreme 
Council has not, evidently, deemed this problem of sufficient 
importance for its special study. This has enabled the 
government to continue unnoticed its former policy, hoping that 
the wood of shock therapy will not be visible behind the trees 
of specific decisions and, in this case, program measures.

"When a City's Major Enterprises Are Idle"] 
  [Text] If a city's mayor tells you that all the major 
enterprises there are idle, under normal circumstances it would 
not occur to a normal person to ask, "Is that good or bad?" 
Although given the situation we find ourselves in these past few 
years, which you might call anything but normal and usual (for 
example, sarcastically: "interesting," fashionably: 
"paradoxical," agitatedly: "critical," realistically: "pathetic 
and deplorable"), any kind of question can arise and even demand 
an answer. What is left to wonder at when that most absurd of 
phrases--"logical paradox" (we hold the copyright)--has a right 
to exist? Nevertheless, the above question did not occur to us. 
Later, as we talked about various things, Rustavi Mayor Soso 
Areshidze himself posed it. 
  We sensed that the question was not rhetorical; he had an 
answer, but not the logical "It's bad." What's good about having 
enterprises stand idle when resumption of operations could 
affect not only Rustavi itself but, in a few days, the whole 
republic? But if that were true, the question would not have 
been asked. 
  In such cases, the question is usually answered by the one 
who asked it: 
  "It depends on who you ask," said the mayor. "As far as I am 
concerned, it is better for an enterprise to stand idle than for 
its earnings to go to the wrong place and be used for the wrong 
things. 
  "Oh yes, I know that just about all countries have the mafia 
problem, but there has to be a limit. Even the mafia has its 
rules. First of all, it is not banditry, otherwise it would have 
a different name. But nobody cares about anything, or respects 
anything or anyone! They've got everything, now they want power. 
Hey, why not?! 
  "They even act as if they were the people's champion! Once 
they took over the bakery. Who asked them?" 
  It used to be that if a raykom secretary asked a friend to 
come work with him, the man's joy--and then his luck--knew no 
bounds. Now, if the mayor or rayon head asks you to come work 
with him you have to have a lot of respect for him not to say no. 
  The ordinary working man does not care for politics, it 
doesn't interest him. He wants a decent life, and if he doesn't 
have it he sees the city's or rayon's top man as the source of 
all his woes. Anonymous persons telephone regional leaders at 
home with brief and specific complaints--"Do your lights work?", 
"Do you have water?", "You aren't hungry or cold, are you?" 
These are so much like the old days (although then the 
complainers probably didn't phone), but the psychology is the 
same: everyone demands that he--the top man--solve their 
problems. 
  Regional management is one of the most important problems of 
Georgia today. As in other aspects of our lives, there is 
disorder and confusion here as well. 
  "We do have our independence," says the mayor. "No one from 
above either helps us or bugs us. In short, they don't get 
involved." 
  A question again, this time from us: "Is that good or bad?" 
And again the answer: "It depends on who you ask...." A little 
later, after he tells us that in the old days he couldn't have 
served as raykom secretary, he wasn't good enough, we pretty 
much understood the meaning of his answer, in this case "It's 
not a bad thing. After all, we have to learn to stand on our own 
feet." And if we recall the beginning of our talk, the 
idea--containing one indispensable condition--logically 
continues: "But first, law and order has to be established." 
  That is indisputable, but of course it does not mean that 
there are not certain other, equally important conditions. We 
talk about cadre policy. The mayor emphasizes the importance of 
choosing personnel correctly, in particular leadership cadres. 
That is as indisputable as the fact that in many spheres, 
reality imposes quite different demands, and poses questions 
too: "How long do we have to put up with our appointed 
leadership?", "Where is the institution of proprietorship?" We 
do agree, after all, that we don't want to go back. We are no 
longer trying to rebuild what we destroyed--otherwise, what was 
the point of destroying it?! Life changes rapidly in terms of 
reality and paradigm, and every step that is delayed hits us 
right in the sorest spots. 
  However slowly, privatization is proceeding [the mayor 
continues]. Relatively small entities--retail and consumer 
outlets--are winding up in the hands of private owners, but 
things are more complicated in the case of major enterprises. 
The process of creating joint-stock companies has been slow 
getting started. At present, only six joint-stock companies have 
been registered, while the documentation has been prepared for 
10. 
  Small-scale privatization is hampered by the slow pace of 
differentiating state and municipal property, owing to the 
unacceptability of the law on municipal property ownership. 
Practical steps are being taken to privatize retail and 
transportation outfits which definitely ought to be subject to 
municipal ownership. 
  There are also complaints about joint stock companies: 
enterprise officials have a negative attitude toward amounts of 
shares to be transferred to the labor collectives free of charge 
or at reduced prices in accordance with the republic's 
privatization program, namely 4-5 and 10 percent. At a joint 
meeting of the Mayor's Office and the Collegium of the State 
Property Management Ministry the opinion was expressed that not 
less than 20 percent of the shares should be transferred free of 
charge to the labor collective, and in cases where the state 
does not keep a package of shares, the collective ought to have 
the right to purchase up to 51 percent of the shares on 
preferential terms, which, in our opinion, would be more fair. 
The collectives are treated badly enough as it is. Here's one 
example: by the government's decision, consumption quotas were 
imposed on goods produced last year; according to them, a quota 
of 75 percent of an enterprise's production output went to the 
state, 10 percent stayed with the local administration, and only 
15 percent went to the enterprise. You can imagine how well that 
stimulates the plant's operations! 
  Another issue which I have to raise: this year's 
first-quarter budget. In the case of electricity and gas alone 
we have to pay a subsidy in the amount of a price differential 
of 31 and 35 billion coupons. Not counting other costs, we must 
add to this the funds for health, culture, education, and 
municipal services, adding up to at least 20 billion coupons. In 
other words, the first-quarter budget came out to more than 90 
billion coupons, at a time when, based on present normatives, 
revenues total about 30 billion coupons. 
  This absurdity is due to the fact that the republic Cabinet 
of Ministers decided to reduce enterprise profit taxes, which is 
a good thing in and of itself, but it shouldn't have been done 
at the city's expense alone. At least some percentage ought to 
be retained; the republic takes 90 percent of the value-added 
tax, and only 10 percent remains here. Even if all this tax were 
to be kept by the city, which is not only desirable but 
essential, it wouldn't help things, because it won't pay our 
costs. There is just one solution: the republic ought to take 
over the subsidy, otherwise we won't have the means to pay the 
price differentials. 
  [Question] What are the prospects for developing 
entrepreneurship in the city? 
  [Answer] We are doing everything we can to foster small 
businesses. A total of 2,176 small and one-man businesses, 
additional-liability and limited-liability companies, and 
cooperatives are registered in Rustavi, of which 953 are now in 
operation, including 117 in industry, 101 in construction, and 
735 in commerce. 
  In 1993, 28 billion coupons of finished goods were produced. 
Profits totalled 17.2 billion coupons, and 5.7 billion coupons 
went into the budget. The results would have been better if it 
were not for the energy crisis, which has not only hurt small 
businesses and firms but also major industrial giants, and if 
they cease operations we are in trouble. After all, Rustavi is 
an industrial city, we have no other reserves. Some progress has 
been made; a few enterprises have resumed operations. We need 
more. 
  [Question] Any chance of that? 
  [Answer] There is hope. If we can get the energy, we'll get 
on our feet. The Azot Production Association needs 80 megawatts 
of electricity and 50,000 cubic meters of gas per hour to 
operate properly, and supplies need to be steady. Other 
enterprises have similar problems. If Azot can't work, almost 
all of agriculture will fail. These problems are interconnected 
and condition one another. 
  [Question] We think of the resumption of enterprise 
operations as a solution, but "who are they going to be working 
for?" Isn't that problem still on the agenda? 
  [Answer] Things are hopeful there too. The recent 
republic-wide effort--open, implacable war against the criminal 
world--gives grounds for optimism. 
  There are many problems. Moreover, as the mayor says, "each 
problem comes first." Nevertheless, two main problems stand 
out--the economy, and law and order. Should they be dealt with 
in parallel or in sequence? On the one hand, there is the 
criminal, created by society, for whom the appropriate 
environment must be created--a real chance to make a living 
through honest labor--before asking him to go straight. On the 
other hand, until law and order is in place any thought of 
creating wealth is just an idle dream. 
  "Where shall we begin?", says city Police Chief Rezo 
Belkania, answering our question with the same question. "From 
my viewpoint it would be best to start with the economy." 
  [Question] The businessman would probably say that first you 
need law and order. 
  [Answer] And both of us would be right. All kidding aside, 
probably we have to act first, to create the necessary 
conditions for creating wealth, and, in addition, a mechanism 
for protecting it, or, to put it another way, provide a 
guarantee that the wealth will go to its proper destination. 
  [Question] Who gives you the most trouble in your 
activities? 
  [Answer] The armed formal units. There are virtually no 
armed 
informal units left in the city. 
  For example, let's say we catch someone in the act. We 
report 
them to their superiors and turn them over for appropriate 
action. But only one action is forthcoming--the criminal is out 
on the streets the next day. Once we arrested some military 
police officers in a restaurant for hooliganism, we disarmed 
them and turned them over to the Military Police authorities. 
They released them in a half hour and gave their weapons back. 
And then you know what they did? They went back to the 
restaurant and resumed their drinking party, after which they 
caught one of our officers that had taken part in the raid, 
killed him and threw him into the Kura River. 
  Another incident: Someone stole an automatic weapon and two 
submachine guns from an armed unit belonging to the Defense 
Ministry. We caught the thieves, who turned out to be uniformed 
personnel of the same unit. They were free in a week. 
  Recently, 13 men armed with automatic weapons broke into the 
auxiliary farm of the Metal Components Plant and stole five 
cows. The bandits were caught red-handed, and guess who they 
were? Members of the Rustavi Reconnaissance and Landing 
Battalion of the Defense Ministry's First Army Corps. 
  [Question] Wow! Almost hard to believe.... Apparently they 
reconnoitered the target, then they made their assault and 
carried out the operation. But it fell through. 
  [Answer] They were free in two days, although after the 
incident that Corps was abolished.... Nevertheless, we can all 
see that a fresh breeze is blowing, from the top. The process is 
underway. Nothing can stop us now. The criminals' days are 
numbered. But would you like to know what kind of equipment they 
have? We could only dream. They are in radio contact with each 
other. Weapons and gasoline are no problem to them. We, on the 
other hand, when two crimes take place at once, have a hard time 
deciding which one is more urgent to go to. There is no way we 
can go both places. Everything is a problem for us, even 
uniforms for the personnel. Still, we are accomplishing some 
things. But we are still far from being satisfied. We need the 
public's support, and though it is slow in coming I think we are 
getting it. And so, we are not retreating. We have to establish 
order. People have enough trouble without being fearful as well. 
[end of Belkania quote] 
  The police chief's attitude is commendable. 
  The police are working and will probably win. 
  "Where shall we start?" Rustavi's First Deputy Mayor for 
Economic Affairs Malkhaz Gvazava has an unequivocal answer to 
that question: "Start by establishing order. Without that, 
anything else is empty talk. The economy can get on its feet 
only under conditions of law and order. A vigorous economy and 
proper management of it--privatization, the formation of 
joint-stock companies, and land distribution--these are the 
things that create the conditions which foster development. 
Budget-funded organizations will have to start making the 
changes called for in the plan. These are the conditions that 
will serve to correct the situation. Our city's great potential 
gives grounds for real optimism. 
  "To put people to work we need the appropriate mechanism, 
but 
we are not giving enough thought to it. In the past few years we 
have destroyed a great deal, but we have not destroyed what we 
should have destroyed first--the socialist mentality and way of 
thinking. We will have to totally reorder our thinking and 
views, cut new patterns. Consider this simple example: How many 
educators or, for example, doctors do we need? Not as many as we 
have. Not everyone is going to be able to work in his specialty, 
only the best ones will succeed in doing so. The selection has 
to be objective and tough. I realize that this is a harsh 
policy, perhaps even cruel, but it is the only way. Our thinking 
has to be pragmatic. The principle of our best interests has to 
be paramount. This is the only way to ensure professionalism. 
There is no other way to build the future society." 
  When Rustavi's mayor says that almost all the city's 
enterprises are idle, it can only foster a hopeless mood, but 
when Rustavi's police chief says that he has real grounds for 
optimism, that makes us hopeful. What we have here, undoubtedly, 
is a sense of the responsibility which today's harsh realities 
impose on officials who must break through the blank wall of 
hopelessness. 
  The mayor's statement that the city is beginning to move, 
that enterprises are resuming operations, are practical 
confirmation of this.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleko Aslanishvili and Odik Kukhilava under the </F>
rubric "Report From the Emergency Zone": "The Sun Is Peeking 
Through"] 
  [Text] 1. "I'M NOT AFRAID TO GO INTO ANY 
VILLAGE"A 
  For the philistine, the "trouble in Mingrelia" is not over. 
The philistine looks suspiciously at the man just in from 
Zugdidi or Tsalendzhikha and tries a "shrewd" guess: "Are there 
still roadblocks on the highways?" "Are people walking freely in 
the streets?" The philistine wants to know the truth, but he's 
still suspicious; for him, the truth is bounded by his own 
narrow vision. For him, therefore, the question that is on 
everyone's lips, "What's happening in Mingrelia?", still carries 
political import. 
  Well, then, we will start by answering that question: What's 
happening in Mingrelia now is, in general, what's happening all 
over Georgia. There's hope and there's hopelessness; people are 
fearful of the morrow, people are tired of the uncertainty, 
people want work and quiet, people are less agitated about 
politics, and, to tell the truth, they couldn't care less about 
a lot of things that, we think, people here in Tbilisi worry 
about.... 
  If there is anything that greatly stirs the emotions in 
Zugdidi these days, it is the adversities of the Abkhazian war 
and the refugee problem, because both matters are terribly close 
to them. These are probably the main concerns, although a city 
and rayon that are on the front lines have plenty of other 
problems too. 
  Nevertheless, what is probably of most concern to readers is 
the present political confrontation and crime situation in the 
region. We have already partially mentioned this in general, but 
now we will elaborate. 
  This lovely city is in dire straits. Everywhere you look 
there are burnt-out buildings. The streets are thronged with 
people--refugees who have nothing to do or anyplace to go, and 
so they kill time talking to each other, grasping at straws, 
fine-combing a thousand times through any bit of news in the 
desperate hope of a tangible chance to return to Abkhazia. 
  A brief digression: Last year (and the year before 
last) were really difficult and extraordinary times for Zugdidi 
and its people. Between January 1992 and November 1993, about 30 
buildings burned down--the Inguri Pulp and Paper Combine's 
Egrisi Hotel, the Odishi Hotel, the military commissariat, the 
city internal affairs department, the environmental protection 
building, municipal services buildings, the Tutarchela shopping 
center, the trade administration warehouse, School No 8, the 
main building of the boarding school.... The television tower 
was blown up, and dozens of industrial, agricultural, 
educational, cultural, consumer service, and other structures 
were trashed. The machine building plant has been looted (copper 
components have been removed from costly program-control 
machines, and a third of the equipment cannot be restored. The 
Music and Choreography Society's enterprise has been stripped 
clean, the Meat Combine is now nothing but a shell; everything 
else has simply been looted. The damage done by fires alone is 
estimated at over 60 billion rubles. That's just the estimate! 
But there is no way to calculate in rubles the spiritual and 
physical trauma suffered by society, or the lives of 130 
Zugdidians sacrificed in the confrontation of brothers "on both 
sides." 
  Colonel Pridon Adamia, chief of the Zugdidi Internal 
Affairs Administration, has this to say: I was appointed to 
this position last year, on 6 November. Before that, I served as 
Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister of Abkhazia. We had to fight our 
way out of Sukhumi, which was surrounded. I know Zugdidi very 
well; 20 years ago I served as its chief of militia. I almost 
got killed twice here last year in attacks by the ex-President's 
followers. First near Ingiri, and another time near Tsaishi, 
where I had come on business from Abkhazia, they caught me and 
were going to shoot me. When the Head of State appointed me and 
rayon head Edisher Chargazia, he said "You with your wise gray 
head and experience, and Edisher with his youthful energy and 
enthusiasm, will complement one another, and I hope we will soon 
return Zugdidi to normalcy." We gave him our word and are doing 
everything we can to keep it. 
  Now about your question: The "Mingrelian resistance" is a 
myth, a concocted story designed to aid their side, and they 
even managed to convince some segments of the public, or rather 
they convinced themselves. There was no "Mingrelian resistance." 
What was happening here was absolutely unacceptable to 80 
percent of the region's population. Eighty percent! What 
happened was that the ex-President's followers brought all their 
supporters together in Zugdidi, from all over the republic, 
where they indulged in violence and lawlessness, senseless 
sabotage and terror, which the law enforcement agencies, manned 
by weak and unprincipled cadres, could not cope with. Zugdidi 
and some neighboring rayons were virtually cut off from the rest 
of the republic. The public at large, its leaders, and--most 
important--the basic nucleus of the urban and rural 
intelligentsia, were afraid and downhearted. Hence, Mingrelia 
had nothing to do with it. The pace of stabilization that is 
underway in the region now will convince you of this. 
  Until November 1993, when government troops entered Zugdidi 
and took control of the situation, the police were attacked 
repeatedly, resulting in the building being burned down and 
destroyed, officers being killed, and almost all weapons, 
equipment, and vehicles being stolen. The police were only 
guarding certain special and vital objects such as banks, the 
bakery combine, the milling combine, and the museum. In order to 
reinvigorate the Internal Affairs Administration, we reorganized 
the personnel. We discharged over 50 officers and demoted over 
20. City and rayon departments were set up in the city's and 
rayon's territory. We recently added 100 staff slots. We are 
creating subdepartments in Narazeni, Darcheli, Tsaishi, Zeda 
Etseri, and Kuleshkari, which will enable us to deal more 
promptly and efficiently with crime and maintain closer contacts 
with the public. 
  Today there is not a single armed supporter of the 
ex-President hiding in the woods of Zugdidskiy Rayon. We have 
brought them over to our side (about 500 men!); today they are 
wielding hoes or have been formed into official military 
outfits. A number of them have left the rayon. They voluntarily 
turned in about 500 automatic weapons (not to mention 
confiscated heavy equipment and lots and lots of shells and 
cartridges), and we are not prosecuting them. Forty men whose 
weapons we had to take by force are being prosecuted. 
  These days I'm not afraid to go into any village. By this I 
mean, there are no more organized armed political opponents. On 
the other hand, the crime situation is very bad. For one thing, 
there are about 80,000 refugees in the city and rayon. Many 
low-lifes and criminal elements came with them, and they are 
continuing to engage in banditry and make trouble. For another 
thing, besides the police there are eight different armed 
formations in Zugdidi, and they do not obey one another--namely, 
Sukhumi, Ochamchire, Gali, and Zugdidi internal troop units, and 
Gali and Zugdidi Mkhedrioni units.... Eight different military 
units! Many of these fighters are obviously undisciplined, and 
some of them have been in jail three or four times. Moreover, 
the Abkhazian Military Police, headed by Colonel Temur Khazalia, 
which is supposed to be keeping order among them, is defending 
the temporary border on the Inguri--besides the fact that 
Abkhazian boyeviki [guerrillas] and their mercenaries have been 
attacking peaceful villages and engaging in criminal activities, 
stealing property and kidnapping people. We have caught many 
criminal gangs. Unfortunately, they include many military 
men.... [end of Adamia quote] 
  Batoni Pridon Adamia told us that recently he had punished 
one officer because two of the man's cartridges were missing. He 
said it off-hand, while he was talking about strengthening 
discipline in the police administration, but that nuance caused 
us to draw a parallel several times when we heard confused 
gunfire in the city. One time we happened upon the boys of the 
"Gali Battalion" expending probably a couple of hundred 
cartridges on some bottles for target practice, just for fun. 
Another time, a warning shot by one "quick-on-the-trigger" 
officer of the property protection administration startled us 
right downtown. A third time, some unit's brave lads broke in on 
a gathering of refugees who were upset over a tasteless 
statement by Butros Butros-Ghali in the UN Security Council on 
21 March, acted like bullies and shot up the place. 
  This is just to illustrate that whenever the peace is 
disrupted in the city, it is generally due to the creative 
efforts of those numerous armed formations or news of the 
enemy's fresh attacks on villages across the Inguri, which are 
administratively part of Zugdidskiy Rayon. 
  Nevertheless, life goes on relatively normally in this 
front-line city and rayon. 
  The number one task today is to improve the region's economy 
and boost agriculture. 
  Agroindustrial Association Chairman Vazha Pipia has 
this to say: Our rayon's agrarian sector includes 25 
kolkhozes, 10 social-sector farms, 10 inter-farm enterprises, 
two agrocombines and five agrofirms and joint-stock companies. 
  Last year left us a poor legacy. Instead of the planned 
40,000 tonnes of tea leaf, only 9,400 were picked. Lack of 
control, disorganized labor and lack of discipline have brought 
it about that the tea plantations have not been tended properly, 
the necessary measures have not been carried out, 85 percent of 
the nut plantations have been appropriated by the people under 
the pretext of privatization, and the rest are in ruins and 
unfenced. Because of failure to carry out cropping operations 
properly, tung, bayleaf, mulberry, and other perennial plantings 
have declined. Things are critical in the livestock sector: only 
six social-sector farms still have a livestock section complex, 
and the cattle population is low. A lot of agricultural 
machinery and tools have been stolen or wrecked. 
  Everything needs to be repaired and restored. Even though we 
suffer from a chronic shortage of fuel (at this stage we need at 
least 200 tonnes of diesel and 30 tonnes of gasoline for spring 
operations, but so far we have only received 30 tonnes of 
diesel), somehow or other the pruning and shaping of the tea 
plantations is going smoothly, also laochay procurement. About 
200 tonnes of laochay have already been procured, and we could 
have boosted that to 1,000 tonnes if it weren't for the lack of 
fuel. We have customers for it too, who will pay in dollars. But 
instead of procuring it we're letting it rot in the ground. We 
also have an experimental tea pressing factory to make brick tea. 
  So far we haven't received any kind of mineral fertilizer. 
But we took 800 tonnes of phosphorous and potassium fertilizer 
left over from last year and applied them to the soil. 
  The power shortage is making it hard for us to prepare the 
tea factories for the season. The factories still have 150 
tonnes of half-finished goods that have not been sorted. 
  There is another problem that has us worried--we are afraid 
that the skyrocketing price of fuel and energy is going to make 
our tea industry unprofitable. According to preliminary 
estimates, a kilogram of packaged tea is now worth as much as 
3,000 Russian rubles, but in barter exchange our tea is not 
worth more than 1,500 rubles. The government ought to take a 
protectionist attitude toward agriculture. 
  The value of tea leaf has yet to be settled. Presumably, 
5,000 coupons for hand-picked tea. The controversy goes on. The 
peasant demands either Russian money or goods in kind. 
  This year we rectified one of last year's injustices: the 
tea 
factories made a lot of unearned profit by buying tea leaf 
cheaply from the social-sector farms (or, more accurately, at 
the current prices then), processing it, and then selling it 
dearly (the prices suddenly shot up), leaving the farms with the 
short end of the stick. Therefore, we made the factories give 
half their profits from last year back to the farms. This money 
will be used to save the plantations. In the past two or three 
years not a single gram of tea leaf has been picked on 45 
percent of our plantations--2,400 hectares (more accurately, 
followers of the ex-President wouldn't let it be picked)--and 
the plantations reverted to the wild. 
  There are 15 state-owned and 14 cooperative mini-factories 
in 
Zugdidskiy Rayon. These mini-factories have caused us no little 
trouble. They are currently being reregistered and relicensed, 
this in order to determine the legality of the sources of their 
tea leaf, allocation and construction of facilities, and 
compliance with technological specifications. As for the 
family-owned shops (there used to be more than 150 of them in 
the rayon), the Board has banned them. This is because they were 
not complying with the specifications of tea leaf processing, 
and because they were operating basically on stolen materials 
and electricity. [end of Pipia quote] 
  Other qualitative changes are taking place in Zugdidi. 
People 
are in favor of retaining the social-sector farms. The Board's 
course of action is to create Agro Associations and 
Agrocombines. Integration is underway. Where farms and tea 
factories were once separate, they are now being joined in the 
form of combines; otherwise, the farms would inevitably go 
bankrupt, and that would be a heavy burden on the working man. 
The idea of creating agrofirms and agrocombines was necessitated 
by this injustice. 
  The first agrocombine was created in Ingiri in 1986. Now 
tested in practice, the experiment is being adopted widely. 
Already created this year are the Zeda Etseri Agrocombine, the 
Rukhi Commercial Production Agrofirm, the Narazeni Agrofirm, and 
the Akhalsopeli Joint-Stock Company. So far, all the kolkhozes 
and farms have been preserved. 
  It briefly rained that day in Zugdidi. What happened was, it 
suddenly clouded over, the way it does in coastal areas, but it 
didn't turn into a downpour. Soon the sky cleared again and the 
sun peeked through, just as sunshine is beginning to appear in 
all spheres of the life of Zugdidi. But that is a subject for 
future articles.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Solovov, candidate of economic sciences and </F>
deputy chairman of the Bank of Russia: "The Monetary Policy of 
the CIS Countries: Coordination Is Needed"] 
  [Text] At the initiative of the Association of 
Russian Banks, the Council on Foreign and Defense Policy, 
Mezhekonomsberbank [Intereconomic Savings Bank], and the "Novaya 
Politika" [New Politics] Center for Humanitarian Relations and 
Business Cooperation, an international banking conference is 
being held with the title "Possible ways to establish an 
efficient mutual settlement of accounts system for Russia with 
the states of the near abroad on the level of central and 
commercial banks." 
  Taking part in the conference's work will be 
representatives of the central and commercial banks of Russia 
and the countries of the near abroad and managers of state 
departments. The material by deputy chairman of the Bank of 
Russia V. Solovov has also been prepared within the framework of 
this conference. 
  At the present time, resolving the problems of 
developing the monetary systems of the CIS states and organizing 
payments between the legal and physical persons of these states 
is becoming increasingly urgent. Introducing national currencies 
and making the currencies and credit markets of the states of 
the former Union distinctive have generated a lot of questions 
which must be answered to eliminate the obstacles which have 
formed in mutual settlement of accounts and to create an 
effective payment system. 
  I must confess that at this time there is no proper 
coordination of monetary-credit policy of the CIS states, most 
economic organizations are experiencing serious difficulties in 
transferring money from one country to another, the national 
currencies market is not developed, and certain currencies of 
these states are not quoted at all by the Bank of Russia, even 
for accounting purposes. Accordingly, there is no developed 
system of exchange of currencies of the Commonwealth states, 
freely convertible currencies and the Russian Federation ruble 
act as the real means of payment when citizens travel to 
neighboring states, and the Russian ruble's role on the "black" 
market of virtually all the CIS states remains significant, 
which naturally concerns their central banks when they are 
resolving questions of stabilizing their national currencies. 
  In these conditions, the desire to solve the problems of the 
accounts-payment relations of the members of the Commonwealth is 
becoming stronger and stronger. The need for such a solution is 
the result of the extremely close economic interrelations 
between the enterprises of these states, the many relations of 
kinship and friendship among citizens, traditional passenger 
traffic, and other factors which allowed the Soviet Union to be 
a real unified national economic and civil complex. Resolving 
the problem should provide legal entities the opportunity to 
make payments for output delivered and settle accounts on other 
debt obligations. 
  Since there are different currencies in the two states, 
payments must be made either in one currency or the currency the 
payer has must be converted beforehand into the currency the 
recipient of the payment needs. The first thing all the 
participants in interstate settlement of accounts of the states 
of the former Union encountered was their lack of an organized 
currency market. The central banks have to perform the task of 
creating currency exchanges. Not all states have managed to this 
at this point. A currency policy requires coordination. 
  After July 1992, the tendency toward a policy focused on 
full-scale introduction of national currencies in the states of 
the former Union increased. However, representatives of many 
states continued to declare their commitment to preserving the 
common ruble space and their intention to follow coordinated 
monetary-credit, currency, budget, tax, customs, and price 
policies. These sentiments were most fully reflected in the 
interstate agreement signed in Bishkek on 9 October 1992. But by 
November 1992, Ukraine had already introduced its own national 
currency, and then Moldova, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kirghizia, and 
Turkmenistan did so. 
  With the introduction of national currencies, the central 
(national) banks faced the task of supporting the payments of 
economic subjects to their partners from other states of the 
former Union, which is feasible with mutually convertible 
currencies. Banks, with the exception of the Bank of Russia, had 
no experience in currency regulation and the organization of 
trade in currencies, and many questions had to be resolved in 
slapdash fashion. Since both the Russian Federation ruble and 
the currencies of the other CIS states were constantly being 
devalued, the exchange rates of the currencies could not be 
stabilized. The Russian Federation currency in fact played the 
leading role in interstate settlement of accounts of the CIS 
countries, which again put the question of the role of the 
Russian ruble and the Bank of Russia on the agenda. 
  In practice, the mechanism for managing payments in the 
central (national) banks of the states of the former USSR (other 
than Russia) was reduced to selecting the top priority payments 
(at the discretion of the representatives of the governments and 
national banks) which the balance in the correspondent account 
in the Bank of Russia (in Russian book entry rubles) permitted 
to be transferred to the banks of Russia. With such a practice, 
commercial banks and their clients were deprived of the 
opportunity to manage receipts from the banks of Russia, and the 
capital passed entirely to the disposal of the national banks, 
which was not in the interests of the commercial banks' clients. 
  It got somewhat easier for commercial banks to handle 
interstate accounts in the second half of 1992 after the Bank of 
Russia allowed accounts to be done through the correspondent 
accounts of the commercial banks which they opened in others' 
banks. When an account was opened, certain conditions had to be 
met, in particular the requirements of legislation of both the 
Russian Federation and the state of the nonresident bank. 
  As for payments through the central banks, to an increasing 
degree they began to depend on the amount of technical credit 
which the Russian Federation offered to the particular state of 
the former USSR. From the very start, the Russian Federation 
government restricted the granting of technical credits, and 
starting on 1 July 1993, by decree of the Russian Federation 
Supreme Soviet of 30 June 1993, the Bank of Russia was 
prohibited from offering credits to governments and central 
(national) banks of the states of the former USSR. The new state 
credits began to be offered using only the capital of the 
Russian Federation budget. By the second quarter of 1993, a 
substantial part of trade exchange had already begun to be 
served by settlements on the accounts of commercial banks, and 
the role of the correspondent accounts of central banks in 
serving commodity turnover substantially declined. 
  This situation was the result of the fact that the currency 
and credit policy followed by the central (national) banks and 
governments of the CIS states did not give incentive to 
enterprises and commercial banks to transfer Russian rubles 
through the central (national) banks' accounts in the Bank of 
Russia. The problem of currency regulation and organization of a 
currency market arose in all its fullness for the central banks. 
  A normal market of the currencies of the CIS states has 
still 
not been organized in the Russian Federation's currency 
exchanges. The volumes of national currencies offered on the 
Russian Federation's currency exchanges are much greater than 
the demand for these currencies, and the quotation of these 
currencies made by the Bank of Russia based on the results of 
trading sessions can hardly be called representative. And it is 
no accident that in publishing these rates, the Bank of Russia 
does not assume the obligation of buying or selling the 
corresponding currencies at the rates set, and they are largely 
employed only for the purposes of accounting and taxation. 
  The shortage of Russian rubles on the markets of the CIS 
countries was created not only by objective factors (the 
imbalance of commodity exchange with Russia and the nonpayments 
of Russian purchasers), but is also a result of the currency 
policy of the corresponding states which makes it unprofitable 
for exporters of goods to Russia to transfer the rubles received 
through the official channels of the central banks. Commercial 
structures are actively speculating on various currency rates. 
  At present Russian sellers still have little interest in 
receiving payment in the national currency, since they 
experience some difficulty spending this capital on the 
territory of the corresponding states, including because of 
limited potential to convert the national currencies into rubles 
or freely convertible currency, as well as limited access to 
highly liquid goods of the local market, which is frequently 
monopolized. 
  The condition of the Russian Federation's credit-settlements 
and payment relations with the CIS states throughout 1993 was an 
object of special concern during all interstate negotiations. 
The crisis in interstate accounts settlement was in many 
respects also tied to the insolvency of Russian enterprises, and 
because of that the CIS states could not have at their disposal 
all the revenue from exporting output to Russia which could have 
been used to stabilize the national currency's rate relative to 
the ruble. 
  The fact that the customers from the CIS countries did not 
have ruble assets and that the Russian sellers were unwilling to 
accept payment in their national currencies from them in itself 
paralyzed normal market relations and led to a cutback in 
economic ties, which, given the high degree to which the 
economies of the members of the Commonwealth were integrated, 
had extremely bad consequences for all the states, including 
Russia. 
  So-called barter clearing began to be used as one of the 
measures for maintaining interstate cooperation; this meant that 
products vitally important to the states were exchanged in kind 
based on their equivalent values in world prices. But barter 
clearing substantially impaired the possibility of forming 
currency markets both in Russia (in view of the demand for the 
national currencies of the CIS countries) and in the 
Commonwealth states (in view of the supply of Russian rubles). 
  On 22 January 1993, the Agreement on the Creation of an 
Interstate Bank of the CIS States was signed, and it was 
supposed to help primarily in improving interstate settlement of 
accounts. But up to this point, this bank has not begun to 
perform its operations, since not all the founding states and 
members of the Interstate Bank have fulfilled their obligations 
to the bank. 
  The difficulties in handling interstate settlement of 
accounts by book entry instead of cash created increased 
interest in settlements in cash. Despite the prohibitions, these 
settlements became more and more popular. The migration to 
Russia of cash in the form of 1961-1992 series ruble notes of 
USSR Gosbank and the Bank of Russia, issued by the banks of 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and other states which had 
not introduced their own bank notes, reached a scale which 
threatened the interests of monetary circulation in the Russian 
Federation. 
  For this reason, on 23 July 1993 the Bank of Russia declared 
that 1961-1992 series banknotes of USSR Gosbank and the Bank of 
Russia would cease to circulate on Russia's territory starting 
on 26 July 1993. Previous to this decision, from the very start 
of 1993, the Bank of Russia had been putting exclusively 1993 
series banknotes of the Bank of Russia into circulation on 
Russia's territory, and they were not turned over to the 
disposal of the central (national) banks of the other states of 
the ruble zone. The result of this action was completion of the 
process of Russia's introducing a national currency, which 
started in mid-1992 with the introduction of a correspondent 
accounts system for interstate settlement of accounts. 
  This decision of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation 
required that Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, 
and Armenia immediately decide what paper money they were going 
to use on their territories and how their monetary systems would 
be managed in the future. 
  The Russian Federation expressed its readiness to offer the 
1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia to the disposal of 
the central (national) banks of these states, but given that 
they definitely comply with a number of conditions, the most 
important ones being that they transfer to the Bank of Russia 
the authority to regulate the volumes of credit and cash-money 
emission, strictly comply with the unified rules for completing 
banking transactions and interbank settlement of accounts, and 
follow a unified currency and interest policy. 
  These conditions defined the essence of the new type of 
ruble 
zone, and the agreement on practical measures for its creation 
was signed in Moscow on 7 September 1993 by the heads of the 
governments and central (national) banks of the Russian 
Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, and 
Tajikistan. Turkmenistan had already made the decision to 
introduce its own national currency by this time and did not 
take part in the agreement. 
  During interstate negotiations on the intergovernmental and 
interbank levels which took place afterward on particular 
conditions for combining the monetary systems of the states 
participating in the agreement of 7 September 1993, the parties 
did not manage to achieve accord on the conditions for the 
central (national) banks to immediately receive for their 
disposal cash in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank 
of Russia, which these states (other than Belarus) desperately 
needed. The adoption of a decision dragged out for an indefinite 
time and that destabilized the domestic market of the states 
where the Soviet ruble continued to circulate; in connection 
with that, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Armenia made the decision 
to refrain from hastily combining the monetary systems and 
introduced national currencies (November-December 1993), while 
Tajikistan received a state credit from the Russian Federation 
in the form of 1993 series banknotes of the Bank of Russia. 
  In this way, in 1993 the new type of ruble zone did not come 
about on the territories of six CIS states. At this time (late 
March 1994), negotiations on unifying the monetary systems of 
the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus continue and 
are close to completion. 
  So, as a result of the lack of proper coordination of 
monetary-credit policy followed in 1991-1993 by the states of 
the former USSR, the monetary system of the Soviet Union had 
ceased to exist by the end of 1993 and all states of the former 
USSR had acquired their own monetary systems headed by the 
central (national) banks formed on the basis of former USSR 
Gosbank institutions. These banks are accumulating experience in 
autonomous existence and almost all of them are encountering the 
same problems of development and growth. So regular exchange of 
experience is important and a joint search for decisions to the 
problems arising is necessary. 
  The extreme interdependence of the economies of the CIS 
states objectively serves as the basis for currency integration. 
It cannot be considered accidental that there is a growing 
awareness of the importance and objective need for economic 
integration of all or some of the CIS countries with the 
creation of superstate organs, including an emissions bank. It 
is noteworthy in the situation in the Commonwealth states that 
they are able, by relying on recent past experience, to resolve 
the problems of a currency union much faster than, say, the 
states of the European Community.

"On the Way to a Unified Economic Space?"] 
  [Text] The Moscow Meeting of the Leaders of the CIS 
States marked another frontier in the transformation of 
post-Soviet space. The frontier is more an economic one and 
marks the starting point for practical steps in compatible 
market transformations of the national economies and their 
integration in stages. 
<H5>  Imbalance of Interests </H5>
  During the time of the USSR, the mutual ties of the present 
participants in the Commonwealth accounted for at least 20 
percent of the aggregate gross national product. About 
three-quarters of the economic interests of the Union republics 
were oriented to Russia and roughly one-third of Russian needs 
for output of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemistry, 
machinebuilding, and light industry was in their hands. For 
certain types of raw materials, rare earth elements, and 
components, Russia even now is 70-100 percent dependent on 
supplies from the CIS. According to some estimates, the 
disintegration of economic ties in 1992-1993 accounted for from 
30 to 60 percent of the lost gross national product of the 
Commonwealth countries. 
  The awareness of objective interdependence is coming through 
the breakdown of the euphoria of sovereignty, the collapse of 
unrealizable hopes for the satisfying and warm embraces of the 
West and rich "spiritual-historical" relatives, and a sharper 
sense of the catastrophe of economic isolation. It is calculated 
that each percentage point of reduction or, in contrast, 
expansion of mutual deliveries impoverishes or enriches the 
partners in the CIS by between 4 percent (Russia) and 10 percent 
(Turkmenistan) of gross national product. But the complete 
disruption of economic ties in the Commonwealth threatens Russia 
with a one-third reduction in final consumption, and the other 
participants in it--with a decline to scarcely one-sixth the 
former level. 
  On the other hand, the impossibility and in fact uselessness 
of at any price preserving economic ties in the form in which 
they developed under the all-Union distribution of labor and 
cooperation is recognized no less clearly. An approach 
consisting of at least three forces of influence has clearly 
taken shape. First, the attempt to identify those 
production-technological links which--if they are not mutually 
coordinated--make it impossible to overcome the economic crisis, 
achieve stabilization, and develop in the future. Second, the 
aspiration for the kind of structural reorganization of 
production which ensures economic security and independence 
(oil, electricity production, and food) by relying on one's own 
efforts. Third, with the support of the CIS countries to create 
favorable conditions for increasing export potential, for 
attracting investments preferably from the far abroad, and for 
making breakthroughs to contemporary technologies and to new 
sales markets. 
  Under these approaches, national-state interests inevitably 
become paramount. Russia is attempting to overcome the donor 
attitude toward itself, establish equivalent exchange, and 
protect its current and long-term geopolitical and economic 
interests. This pertains especially to the effectiveness of 
deliveries to the Commonwealth countries of fuel and energy 
resources, preservation of traditional sales markets, and access 
to unique sources of strategic raw materials and the transport 
infrastructure. The Russian partners obviously are interested in 
cheap energy media, equipment, and consumer goods, sales markets 
for their output, and credit resources, and figuring on 
"fraternal aid." 
  Achieving parity of interests and balancing them is for now 
difficult to do. A more down-to-earth calculation predominates: 
who wins and who loses, and how much, based on prices, customs 
tariffs, conditions of settlement of accounts, and volumes of 
interrelated deliveries. 
  A "double standard" seems to arise: easy and complete accord 
at the higher levels in terms of general conceptual approaches 
and for multilateral reintegration understandings, and 
difficult, exhausting bargaining on specific bilateral 
agreements. The former remain on paper and the latter are as a 
rule not fully executed. Trade-economic cooperation is being cut 
back. Last year the total volume of commodity turnover between 
Russia and other Commonwealth countries was almost 44 percent 
less than in 1991, while this year the volume of mutual 
deliveries of the major commodities will decline by another 
30-40 percent. 
  Of course, critical drops in production, lower effective 
demand, and nonpayments because of uncoordinated breakthroughs 
to world prices for the basic raw material and fuel-energy 
resources have an effect. The increasing imbalance of interests, 
mutual economic distancing, and the search for more profitable 
alternatives on world markets play no less a role. But as a 
result, integration processes are impeded, their effect is 
reduced, and the new values of a unified economic space cannot 
be fully manifested. 
<H5>  Toward a Market System of Coordinates </H5>
  Today the logic of the integration movements in the 
Commonwealth dictates a different unifying formula--a common 
market space. Here there is no longer the need for structural 
correlation of the production-technological chains, strict 
cooperation relationships, or national-state economic complexes. 
Even if the system of specialization and coordination of 
production is preserved, the interdependence of technologies, 
supply lines, standards, and markets gives economic relations 
among the elements of this system a different market mobility 
and adaptability. The integration paradigms adopted by all the 
Commonwealth countries are more easily and intelligibly 
organized; those paradigms are equitable and mutually 
advantageous cooperation without violating the status quo in the 
political sphere and nonintervention in national-state 
development and without flagrant impact on national economic 
interests. 
  The change to a system of coordinates of a common market 
space is facilitated by a factor which is fundamentally new to 
the former socialist republics and perhaps in world 
practice--the emergence of insolvent demand and artificial 
overproduction... in conditions of a commodity shortage. The 
collapse of the unified currency space, the introduction of 
national currencies which are not interrelated, and the 
one-sided monetaristic policy destroyed the old mechanisms of 
mutual settlement of accounts and sharply constricted the 
already weak effective demand of enterprises and the population. 
Commodity producers and commodity consumers proved to be equally 
insolvent and bankrupt. The resource shortage overlapped with 
the money shortage. The avalanche of nonpayments also paralyzed 
what was left of the unified economic complex and destroyed the 
unified economic space for good. 
  The spontaneous jumps to world prices for raw materials and 
fuel and energy resources played a special role. The 
inconceivable burst of cost inflation put the producers of final 
output in a most foolish position: prices for their items was on 
the world level while quality was on the local level. Naturally, 
the consumer turned to markets of third countries where there is 
at least some selection and where they can buy things that are a 
little better and a little less expensive. 
<H5>  Pragmatism: A Cautious Gamble </H5>
  One certainly cannot say that these processes are not 
followed, noted, or comprehended in the management structures of 
the Commonwealth countries. On the contrary, they are perceived 
very acutely and conclusions which are at times decisive, rigid, 
and unequivocal are drawn. 
  The first and most apparent is that the search for market 
forms of cooperation which are fundamentally new to everyone is 
being stepped up. Above all for those which reduce or compensate 
for inflationary growth in production costs and help restore 
production and set up clarified payment-account settlement 
channels and more realistic mechanisms of mutual coordination. 
Actions in these directions are marked by their apparent 
restraint from abrupt, "shock" movements and cavalier ways, by 
their practicality, and by coordinated transition from the 
simple to the complex which carries real integration meaning. 
  On this level, the Moscow Meeting of Leaders of the 
Commonwealth States can be classified among the most productive. 
And the point is not only the 20 agreements and protocols on 
economic topics signed. The very fact of the translation of 
general talks into the pragmatic language of legal formulas 
which particular economic actions should now be subjected to is 
important. How realistic is this? 
  In terms of the schedule of realization, the closest is the 
start of work by the Interstate Bank for Economic Cooperation. 
Four months have passed since the day the agreement was 
concluded, but there have been no energetic actions--the bank 
cannot act until the founders make their contributions to the 
capital stock. And its main task is to organize interstate 
settlement of accounts within the CIS and be the center of the 
Payments Union and its specialized banking institution. 
  The causes of this situation are by no means the traditional 
disorganization or miserliness. They are deeper--the vagueness 
of mechanisms of currency-monetary settlement of accounts and 
mutual convertibility of the national currencies. For now there 
are more questions than answers. Only general provisions are 
fixed in the concept of the Payments Union: 

  -  the right of participants in trade transactions to 
independently choose the forms of accounts settlements, the 
currency of the contract price, and the currency of the payment; 
  -  mutual recognition of national currencies and the 
unrestricted 
right to use them as a means of payment; 
  -  the possibility of introducing a collective use currency for 
interstate settlement of accounts; 
  -  the sovereignty of the participating states in defining the 
system of convertibility of national currencies into foreign 
currencies for transactions involving the movement of goods and 
services; 
  -  setting of exchange rates of national currencies on the basis 
of supply and demand on the currency exchanges or according to 
the interbank currency market and the obligation to be 
restricted to a single currency rate for all types of foreign 
economic operations. 


    It seems that the Commonwealth has a chance to successfully 
survive the consequences of the collapse of the unified 
currency-monetary system of the USSR, the failure of the "new 
type of ruble zone" to materialize, and the introduction of weak 
and essentially surrogate national currencies. Even a general 
conceptual approach to bringing order here, if not the "light at 
the end of the tunnel," is at least a flicker in the present 
currency absurdities of normalization of trade relations in 
which the old donor-distributor customs and the new economic 
interests tinged with national colors have become intricately 
intertwined. 
  There is almost nothing to compare it with: the trade 
"divorce" was not realized and life together continues, although 
now in different apartments. Russia's new foreign economic 
partners require more of Russia than they are prepared and able 
to share themselves. For example, everyone amicably desires that 
customs duties and restrictions on exporting Russian goods be 
abolished right now; however, they do not want to make counter 
movements but augment the barriers against their exports to 
Russia and in every way possible facilitate those exports' way 
to third countries. And that includes by unsanctioned reexport 
of Russian goods. 
  The mechanism of interests is a simple one: take a few more 
goods in Russia, for the most part energy media, at domestic 
prices which are still lower than world prices, and deliver 
slightly fewer of their own goods and at the level of world 
prices or even higher. Incidentally, that is how it was in CEMA. 
But all we had to do, at Czechoslovakia's initiative, was change 
over to world prices and settlement of accounts in freely 
convertible currency and the production-economic ties which had 
developed over the decades and with them all trade crashed down 
in one hour. 
  Something like that is happening among the Commonwealth 
participants too. Last year under Goskontrakt [State Contract] 
alone, Russian exports exceeded imports by more than 400 million 
dollars. According to the contracts, the opposite balance was 
expected--imports should have exceeded exports by 500 million 
dollars. In a normal economy, a positive trade balance is an 
achievement. But for us it is nothing but losses: deliveries of 
batches at near world prices were paid for largely through 
Russian state credits. The debts on them by the start of 1994 
exceeded 3 trillion rubles [R], although a year before they were 
just R1.3 billion. If in addition Russia unilaterally abolished 
export duties, there would be roughly 4 billion dollars less in 
the federal budget. 
  Without parity in trade-customs policy, there is no free 
trade and there cannot be. Converting to it means in a 
coordinated way and in stages bringing customs regimes closer, 
narrowing nontariff restrictions, and ensuring strict discipline 
in executing contracts. 
  But for now, without reciprocity Russia has again 
magnanimously and recklessly moved along the path of improper 
liberalization of foreign trade. The number of goods under quota 
this year declined from 108 to 38 items. The overall quota of 
deliveries to the Commonwealth states is dropping substantially. 
Export duties on goods whose domestic prices have approached 
world prices are to be lowered. And enterprises and regions and 
private trade and intermediary firms receive priority in foreign 
trade. 
  There is unlikely to be an equivalent response from partners 
to these measures. This year Russia will receive fewer ferrous 
and nonferrous metals, steel pipe, cotton fiber, synthetic 
threads, and food, while its partners in the CIS Economic Union 
will receive fewer energy media and chemical and 
petroleum-chemical output. It seems that the sphere of mutual 
trade is narrowing like pebbled leather. 
  Everyone sees the fundamental solutions to trade-economic 
problems, both old and newly acquired ones, in creating 
civilized conditions for free trade realistic for a market and 
based on the Customs Union. Of course, the way to this is long 
and difficult--through a free trade zone, by-stage agreements, 
and complete development of customs rules and tariff and 
nontariff restrictions. The participants in the Economic Union 
decided to join this path on 15 April 1994. Of course, a free 
trade zone is not yet integration, but all the same it is a 
half-open door to the passage to a common market space regulated 
not by the will of the strong but on an equal basis with due 
regard for mutual interests. 
<H5>  Center-phobia: Remembrance of the Past, Fear for the Future </H5>
  Overall the problem of regulating integration processes and 
managing them still sounds incomprehensible, if not to say 
foolish. And the reasons for this are the persistent allergy to 
the supranational organs of the Economic Union. 
  A plan for an Interstate Economic Committee with very broad 
functions was prepared for the Moscow Meeting at Kazakhstan's 
initiative. Essentially this meant the formation of a 
supranational administrative core with the authority to make 
decisions mandatory for fulfillment. But centrifugal force, 
remembrance of the past, and fears for the future won out, and 
it was confined to a commission of professional experts under 
the CIS Coordinating-Consultative Committee. A decisive 
integration step was postponed for later. 
  Nonetheless, the creation of an Economic Union commission 
must be classified as yet another achievement of the sincere 
advocates of economic integration. Regardless of where, fairly 
powerful intellectual potential can be concentrated in one 
place. The important thing is that not occasionally but on a 
regular basis there is the possibility--on a sensible and 
balanced basis--to formulate recommendations on production 
specialization and cooperation, coordinated measures in the most 
important interstate spheres (transport, communications, energy 
supply, ecology, and elimination of the consequences of 
emergency situations), and joint scientific-technical research. 
Perhaps the most promising function of the commission is to 
formulate proposals on coordinating interstate organs of 
sectorial cooperation and economic structures of the future 
common market--transnational corporations, financial-industrial 
groups, banking consortiums, and joint ventures. 
  If the new commission does not fall into routine work on 
preparing draft agreements of every type but holds out as the 
"brain center," the general problems of economic integration 
will be untangled and its mechanisms worked up, and they will be 
interlinked more rapidly and systematically. Only then can the 
Economic Union be given concrete meaning and be turned into 
reality. 
<H5>  New Turns Toward Integration </H5>
  But for now internal moves are maturing in the Commonwealth; 
their sources are in the area of political ambitions and 
business calculations, distrust of the need for and possibility 
of reintegration of the CIS participants, and mutual 
dissatisfaction and suspicion. The undiplomatic injection of 
fear of Russia's "special role and responsibility" in 
post-Soviet space is feeding all this. One example of these 
moves that put one on guard is the emergence of a trend toward 
regional political-economic integration. 
  Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus awakened the impulse. Last 
summer they declared a Slavic Union. There was in truth little 
of a union or common ground behind this announcement, as life 
showed. It was rather a political declaration, but it stimulated 
processes which were not fully envisioned when its participants 
formed the CIS and the Economic Union. 
  Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were the first to respond and 
announced the creation of a "unified economic space," but 
essentially began to put together a Central Asian free trade 
association along with Kirghizia, which joined them. The 
specifics of this step were for the time being confined to 
eliminating customs borders. But we must expect more radical 
actions along the lines of N. Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian 
Economic Union. In any case, these three Central Asian states, 
it seems, are politically prepared to move toward one another, 
possibly even to the point of forming a regional "common market" 
and even a confederation. 
  On 12 April, after tough, mercenary disputes, Russia and 
Belarus finally announced the actual creation of a 
Russian-Belarusian "common market" with their monetary systems 
unified. But the entire procedure was planned as an action in 
stages, with an eye to its political consequences and economic 
results. 
  It was difficult, but a model of post-Union economic 
integration close to reality in fact emerged. Even though it is 
inferior, politicized, and controversial with a hypertrophied 
role of Russian economic departments. And if it comes about, 
with the exception of aspects which create a "Moscow center" 
syndrome, it will be perfectly acceptable to the rest. Even to 
those for whom unification is not yet a synonym for unity. In 
any case, a political testing ground has appeared for breaking 
in the idea of a Eurasian Confederation, which practical 
politicians repeat with unceasing persistence.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Belova, ABI expert, under the rubric "The </F>
Banking Information Agency": "Is the 'Transferable Ruble' 
Returning? Or, a 'Little Europe' in the CIS"] 
  [Text] In the last issue of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN, the 
Banking Information Agency [ABI] reported on the conference held 
a few days ago, "Possible ways to establish an efficient mutual 
settlement of accounts system for Russia with the states of the 
near abroad on the level of central and commercial banks," 
organized by Mezhekonomsberbank with the participation of the 
leaders of the central (national) banks of Russia, Ukraine, 
Belarus, Kazakhstan, Estonia, and Armenia, the Association of 
Russian Banks, the Interstate Bank, the European Union 
Commission, the Center for European Political Research, the 
Administration of the president of the RF, the State Duma, and 
commercial and savings banks of Russia and the CIS. 
  Today we offer for your attention excerpts from some 
speeches which allow the reader to make up his mind on the most 
important questions dealt with by the conference 
participants. 
  The deputy chairman of the expert council of 
Mezhekonomsberbank, Yu. Konstantinov, presented the 
"general concept of the establishment of an optimal mutual 
accounts settlement system on the level of the central 
(national) banks of the states of the former USSR" formulated at 
the council's initiative. 
  An efficient mutual accounts settlement system can only be 
formulated in a consistent, evolutionary way. Here are two 
acceptable methods for performing this task: 

  -  using nonconvertible currencies in settling accounts, 
bringing them into circulation, and later forming an 
international currency system like the Western European one; 
  -  combining monetary systems into a new type of ruble zone. 


    I would like to mention that a nonconvertible currency 
cannot 
play the role of an international means of payment. "Soft" 
national currencies have an unstable currency rate and are not 
properly supported with goods, gold, and other assets. As a 
rule, they rely on an inflationary economy, one in crisis, and 
frequently they move parallel to the U.S. dollar. 
  Taking into account the experience of 1950s Western Europe, 
creating a payments union of the republics of the former USSR is 
a step toward the convertibility of national currencies and the 
transition from bilateral account settlements to multilateral 
ones. Moreover, a payments union could at the same time help 
perform another pressing task, conserving means of payment 
through the mutual accounts settlement mechanism. 
  Settlement of accounts on nontrade payments, that is to say, 
a smoothrunning mechanism for citizens' money transfers, could 
become an inseparable part of an efficient system for mutual 
settlement of accounts on nontrade transactions. As yet there is 
still no clarity regarding the procedure for setting the 
currency exchange rate needed for nontrade settlement of 
accounts, the mechanism for linking nontrade circulation with 
trade circulation, or agreement between central (national) banks 
on norms for citizens and participants in money transfers to 
take out and bring in ready money. We must not allow national 
income to be pumped from one state to another. 
  Recently the idea of creating a unified currency in the 
context of the possible creation of a Eurasian Union expressed 
by the president of Kazakhstan, N. Nazarbayev, has drawn 
attention. If we start to create a payments union as an organ to 
assist multilateral settlement of accounts, then we will need a 
rated supranational monetary unit for it to function. 
  But the most important question may be the joining of 
monetary systems into a new type of ruble zone, taking into 
account the centrifugal trend which is becoming stronger. The 
creation of a single emissions center will be one of the 
mandatory conditions here. In this case the transition period 
presupposes coordinating the economic, tax, budget, and monetary 
policies of the states which have decided to integrate their 
monetary systems into the Russian one. 
  The position of the Bank of Russia was presented by the 
deputy chairman of the RF Bank of Russia, V. Solovov. 
It is that either a new ruble zone will be created under 
conditions defined by Russia or each national bank will have to 
resolve the problems of payments on its own. There is no way to 
create normal conditions for carrying out interstate settlement 
of accounts other than to ensure a sensible currency and 
monetary-credit policy, strengthen the national currency, fight 
against nonpayments within the country, and develop currency 
markets. Commercial banks are doing the main work on settlement 
of accounts between Russia and the former Soviet 
republics--those banks handle two-thirds of all payments. In 
supporting a large part of the payments, commercial banks can 
offer credits to the CIS countries in the form of overdraft or 
debit balance on a correspondent account. But because of late 
payments, the CIS countries also automatically receive a 
commodity credit from Russia (goods are shipped, but payment is 
not received). The behavior of Russia's partners is also 
notable: after signing documents on combining the monetary 
systems of Russia and Belarus and fixing the exchange rate, the 
National Bank of Belarus doubled emissions. This will obviously 
force Russia to raise the question of revising exchange rate 
ratios. The main condition of a ruble zone is the creation of a 
single emissions center and abandonment of the republic's right 
of emission. That is perfectly natural; a unified currency 
certainly requires a single emissions center. Whether the 
Central Bank of Russia should be this center is another matter. 
Perhaps the Interstate Bank, which will represent the interests 
of all participants, should assume this function. 
  The president of the Interstate Bank, V. Savanin: 
The Interstate Bank should ensure fair settlement of accounts 
among the states of the former USSR. Balanced foreign trade, 
state control over the dynamics of the exchange rate, and 
regulation of a positive payments balance are necessary for 
mutual recognition of the quotations of national currencies. 
Russia's relations with Western partners from the far abroad are 
similar to the relations of the countries of the near abroad to 
Russia. 
  To do this, the CIS countries need to take measures on 
currency regulation and control which ensure that currency 
earnings are returned during trade with Russia, measures similar 
to those which Russia takes in relation to trade with the West. 
The damage done to a country's economy because of the drain of 
capital to Russia or the West undermines the basis for 
settlement of accounts among the CIS countries. The situation 
with the medium-term balance of payments among the countries of 
the near abroad has deteriorated. Moreover, I must mention that 
the activity of the Central Bank of the CIS (if such a thing is 
created) and of the Interstate Bank must be stable and 
independent of the political situation. 
  Commercial banks help resolve day-to-day problems fairly 
well--interstate settlement of accounts among enterprises and 
the like, but they simply are unable to resolve more global 
questions such as stabilization of currencies and their 
quotations and regulation of the payment balance. That is the 
task of the Interstate Bank. But there are certain difficulties 
in organizing its work: as of today the capital stock has not 
been formed and the parties are not properly interested in its 
work. Today R5 billion (the amount of the bank's declared 
capital stock) is clearly not enough to support continuous 
settlement of accounts, and that may lead to the revival of the 
practice of offering technical credits. 
  M. Bronshteyn, the economics consultant at Estonia's 
embassy to the Russian Federation: Introducing a national 
currency in the summer of 1992 was advantageous for both Russia 
and Estonia. For Russia because it had stopped subsidizing the 
republic's economy. But for Estonia its own currency allowed it 
to establish and maintain a set rate in relation to the German 
mark and thereby check escalating inflation. The problem of 
settlement of accounts was immediately solved--commercial banks 
rather than the Central Bank make all payments. There is no 
problem of nonpayments in the republic. The fixed level of the 
Estonian kroon is the result of the independence of commercial 
banks and the absence of any settlement of accounts through the 
republic's Central Bank whatsoever; legislative restriction on 
the volumes of emissions; and the exclusive use of the kroon for 
payments and personal savings. 
  The possibility of normal settlement of accounts is based on 
this. But there can be a healthy currency only with a healthy 
balance. The introduction of world prices for oil and gas was a 
shock for Estonia too, and the problem of maintaining the 
equilibrium of the balance was extremely complicated. Despite 
strong competition on world markets, Estonia has reoriented the 
economy to trade with the West. 
  The deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
Institute of Europe, S. Karagenov, noted that all countries 
must recognize the absurdity of building a superstructure 
without a foundation and discussing minor questions before 
resolving global problems. If at least Russia decides what it 
wants and works out a long-term concept of development of 
economic and political cooperation with the countries of the 
former USSR, that alone will fundamentally facilitate the 
adoption of decisions on particular problems in cooperation with 
the CIS countries. 
  In the opinion of representatives of the Rossiyskiy 
kredit Bank, conversion of currencies with the 
participation of the national banks of the CIS countries is made 
difficult by ambitions regarding local currencies. Enterprises 
are obliged to sell ruble earnings at too low a rate and that 
causes prices to rise and earnings to be hidden. The lack of 
rubles at both national banks and at enterprises complicates the 
normal passage of payments to Russia. It is necessary to expand 
the group of participants in trade in "soft" currency and 
liberalize RF legislation in relation to CIS residents in order 
to resolve these problems. 
  The TOKObank advisor, A. Barnovskiy: The Russian 
ruble does not necessarily have to be the means for settling 
accounts among the CIS countries. A technically unified currency 
can be created on the basis of a weighted basket of national 
currencies. Today the multiple exchange rates of national 
currencies create speculation on cross rates, thereby causing 
the reciprocal export of inflation. The task of the Interstate 
Bank is clearing balances on unbalanced payments and regulating 
the net balance using credits, goods, securities, property, and 
so forth. 
  The advisor of the Center for European Policy Research, 
D. Gros, noted that using the experience of the European 
Community [EC] to create a system of payments in the states of 
the former USSR is problematical. 
  The point is that the structure of trade within the EC was 
very similar--most of them export and import similar goods. In 
contrast, the structures of the economies of the countries of 
the former USSR are fundamentally different. Some are exporters 
of raw materials, others depend on exports of agricultural 
goods, and yet others export industrially produced goods. 
Consequently, these countries have completely different 
interests and are subject to the influence of changes in the 
world economy in a different way. For example, higher prices for 
oil on the world market are good for some countries but require 
strict regulation for others. But in the EC all countries react 
the same way. 
  The second condition for successful integration into the EC 
was complete consensus on questions of economic policy. The tax 
systems of the EC member countries are similar, and stable 
prices and a stable national currency are a goal of 
monetary-credit policy common to all. The tax policy ensures a 
limited budget deficit in such a way that the government can 
service its debt without escalating inflation. There is no such 
accord among the countries of the former USSR now. Different 
countries are at different stages of reform; not one of them has 
stabilized its currency and there is not even accord on the 
question of the desirability of stabilizing it. 
  Until recently the CIS countries were part of one strongly 
integrated economy, and commodity exchange among the USSR 
republics was more intensive than among the EC countries. But a 
large part of the trade ties created in the past cannot be 
maintained for a long time. In the long run, all the CIS 
countries will trade more with other countries, especially with 
the EC countries, than with one another. For example, Russia's 
turnover with other former USSR republics now is roughly only 
one-third of the trade with the rest of the world. 
  The following conclusion can be drawn from what has been 
said: the countries of the former USSR do not now form an 
"optimal currency space." That is to say, from the purely 
economic standpoint, it would be unprofitable to create a common 
currency space with a common central bank. So the probability of 
the successful survival of the "new type of ruble zone" is 
small. Nonetheless, there is potential to stop the breakdown of 
mutual trade. To do this, all quotas, licenses, and tariffs on 
trade within the CIS must be abolished. The new national 
currencies must be stabilized and made convertible. Only then is 
the normalization of mutual payments possible. 
  The opinions expressed by the conference participants did 
not 
always match or did not completely match. But the question of 
the possibility of creating a common economic space and 
reintegration and accordingly the need to create special forms 
of unification of the CIS countries in order to handle 
international settlement of accounts, especially in the form of 
a "new ruble space," was the main disagreement between the 
representatives of the Center for European Policy Research and 
the Russian participants. 
  The question of creating a system of mutual settlement of 
accounts can be reduced not to the technical problem of 
organization, stabilization, and so forth, but to a political 
one: are the participating states (of the Interstate Bank or the 
ruble zone, for example) really ready to give up some of their 
interests and rights for the sake of creating an overall 
efficient system? For an "overall efficient" system will have 
some partial inconveniences for each participant. And now when 
young states which have just been formed are worried about 
preserving their "sovereignty" and "independence," can they 
abandon certain of their national ambitions? The answer is not 
an unequivocal one. 
  Another aspect is that the states which have been formed 
have 
different structures of economies, at times very irrational 
ones, and are at different levels of development and accordingly 
have different economic interests. So combining monetary systems 
may seem altogether economically unprofitable for some countries. 
  But if for subjective (political) or objective reasons, 
certain CIS countries lack incentive, then naturally there will 
be neither energetic work nor results. 
  In addition to that, there are altogether real 
contradictions 
among the subjects of the market within the country as well. For 
example, in most CIS countries there are contradictions between 
the state's goals (raising the exchange rate of its currency in 
relation to the ruble, supporting the national economy through 
its inflationary financing, and regulating currency in order to 
prevent the drain of capital) and the needs of enterprises 
(normal organization of interstate payments and the opportunity 
to freely buy and sell rubles and other currency at other than 
the real rate) as well as the needs of commercial banks which 
want to be able to work on the currency market unhindered. 
  The following conclusion may be drawn from everything which 
was said above: first of all, it must be clarified whether those 
countries for which integration is intended are interested in 
integration. Otherwise, even the optimal system worked out is in 
danger of not being realized in practice. Even with great 
incentive, the sides face a long path of realization in stages, 
one which has taken the countries of the European Community, for 
example, 50 years.

<F P=106> [Article by Katarina Koivisto: "Finland Investing Actively </F>
in Russia and Baltics"] 
  [Text] Finns are actively investing in both Russia and the 
Baltic nations, according to a recent report from the Bank of 
Finland [FB]. The Finns are involved in the most foreign 
companies in Estonia, but their activity in the Russian market 
is also great. On the whole, Finns have invested about a billion 
markkas in companies in the former Soviet Union. 
  Banks as well as taxes and other fees are the greatest 
problems in this activity, according to most business leaders, 
particularly in Russia. However, the majority of the businessmen 
believe that business in both these regions is developing to the 
better. 
  For many years, researcher Juhani Laurila of FB has 
collected 
data on Finnish companies and Finnish joint ventures first in 
the former Soviet Union and now in Russia and the Baltic states. 
Finnish investments have increased since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, Laurila states in his report. Companies believe it 
is so important not to lose market shares that they have made 
investments in Russia and the Baltic nations despite the 
economic and political risks involved in the region. And 
contrary to what most people believe, most of the companies are 
involved in some sort of production and far fewer are in service 
industries. 
  From 1991 to 1993 the number of companies with Finnish 
interests increased primarily in Estonia, but also in the St. 
Petersburg region. In April of last year there were over 200 
such companies in Estonia, representing an increase of over 100 
percent in two years. 
<H5>  Estonia Is a Limited Market </H5>
  In his investigations, Laurila explains the many Finnish 
direct investments in Estonia by the cultural and geographic 
proximity of the countries. Both sides also have a pronounced 
goodwill to do business. One problem perceived by Finnish 
businessmen, however, is that the Estonian market is so small 
that there is limited room for expansion. As a result, most 
Finnish companies in Estonia are small. 
  Many of the companies in Estonia serve as subcontractors to 
Finnish parent companies. This also explains why such a large 
part of their production is exported to Finland. 
  The situation on the Russian market is the opposite, 
according to Laurila. The companies that are active in Russia 
produce mainly for the Russian market, which supports the idea 
that investments have been made in an attempt to retain old 
market shares. 
  According to the study, the biggest problem Finnish 
companies 
have faced in both Russia and the Baltic nations is financing 
and banking services. Most of the investments in Russia have 
been financed with the help of loans from Finland or from third 
countries, while only 6 percent of the capital has come from 
Russia. This percentage is the same in Estonia and four-fifths 
of the Finnish investments there are financed from Finland. 
  According to Laurila, this shows that the old Soviet banking 
system and the new banking system that is developing are both 
unprepared for foreign investments. This lack of preparedness is 
particularly striking in Russia. 
  The banks also function poorly, particularly in Russia, when 
it comes to arranging payments and providing other services. 
  Most of the companies that have participated in Laurila's 
study indicate that, despite everything, they are satisfied with 
their activities in Russia and the Baltic states and believe 
their business will improve. But there are also companies that 
complain that higher and higher taxes and customs duties are 
making business more difficult and that the laws are unclear in 
many important aspects.

<F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Georgiyevich Shelkovnikov, chairman of </F>
"Rosaeronavigatsiya," the Commission for Air Traffic Control: 
"The Frontier of Reliability"] 
  [Text] We heard this name for the first time in 1992. 
Some people viewed the appearance of "Rosaeronavigatsiya" with 
doubt, but others expressed hope that there would be positive 
changes and that order would be brought to Russia's airways, as 
well as to the UVD [Air Traffic Control--ATC] Service itself. 
For many people these hopes were linked with the name of Valeriy 
Georgiyevich Shelkovnikov, the chairman of the Commission for 
Air Traffic Control. Employees of the capital's ATC Service had 
recommended him for this post. Persons who have been in civil 
aviation for more than a year know V.G. Shelkovnikov well. He 
worked in polar aviation, supervised the group testing "Start," 
the first automated system, and headed the TsUVD and GlavUVD MGA 
[Air Traffic Control Central Administration and Air Traffic 
Control Main Administration of the Ministry of Civil Aviation]. 
He is the president of the International Fund for Aviation 
Safety. And now he is once again in the ATC Service. The 
journal's editorial staff asked V.G. Shelkovnikov to tell us 
about the commission he heads and problems in organizing and 
controlling the traffic on Russia's air routes. 
  The creation of "Rosaeronavigatsiya," the Commission for Air 
Traffic Control, was a logical and natural step taken by the 
Russian Federation Government to improve the system for airspace 
use and air traffic control. I will not list all the tasks faced 
by the commission and its functions. I will specify only the 
main directions of its activity. 
  They include developing and introducing a system for 
airspace 
use and supervising adherence to it; organizing the airspace, 
making it available for use, and controlling air traffic; and 
coordinating the activity of ministries , departments, and 
airspace users, as well as interacting with international 
organizations on matters within the commission's competence. 
  Having worked for nearly 30 years in the ATC Service, I know 
all its internal and external problems firsthand and I am very 
familiar with its development. 
  Back in 1921, the Russian Government issued a decree on air 
travel. Even then they had to bring order to the airspace for 
the Sikorskiy, Tupolev, Polikarpov, and all kinds of Fokkers and 
Junkers airplanes to fly safely. But years went by before the 
Unified ATC System was formed in the country. 
  In 1960, the USSR Council of Ministers issued a decree "On 
establishment of a Unified State System for Automated Control of 
Air Traffic" which was to be implemented in three stages. 
However, only the first part of the work--the improvement of 
individual technical facilities--was carried out over the next 4 
years. 
  A draft of basic ATC regulations for the country and a 
preliminary draft for the organization by stages of the Unified 
State System for Air Traffic Control were worked out in the 
mid-1960's. But no further action was taken on these drafts. 
  By the beginning of 1970, the ATC system that existed was in 
such condition that a specially formed commission consisting of 
representatives from all the ministries and departments 
concerned issued a categorical statement: unless organizational 
and technical measures are taken without delay the ATC system 
can expect an extremely severe crisis, and the Unified State ATC 
System must be established over the next 3 years. Alas, after 3 
years civil aviation did not have a well-organized ATC Service, 
just the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers 
decree approving proposals by the Ministry of Defense and the 
Ministry of Civil Aviation to establish a Unified ATC System for 
civil and military aircraft in the 1973-1980 period. More than 
10 years passed before this system was established. It belonged 
to two departments--the Air Forces and the Ministry of Civil 
Aviation. This was its main drawback, and unfortunately, it was 
not the only one. The ATC system that was established was not 
unified, but combined. 
  Structurally and functionally, the system was unjustifiably 
complicated. The same may be said of the territorial and 
departmental division of the airspace. The system's technical 
level left much to be desired. In addition to everything else, 
it was very cumbersome--a great deal of work would be required 
to reorganize it in a critical situation. 
  There were other drawbacks as well. Long before work had 
been 
completed on formation of the Unified ATC System, it became 
clear that it was not meeting the essential requirements and 
needed considerable improvement. The collisions by aircraft 
which resulted in the loss of life and equipment each year were 
eloquent testimony of this. From 1974 to 1985, there were 19 
collisions between aircraft in flight. 
  The specialists continued to insist that the Unified ATC 
System become really unified and that it should be a state 
system. This question, as well as the question of technical 
improvement of the ATC Service, was raised repeatedly at various 
levels beginning in 1980, but the decisions needed were not made. 
  The political and economic changes which began in the USSR 
made the functioning of the services in organizing and 
controlling air traffic even more complicated. Air traffic 
control had to be adapted to the new realities, particularly to 
the existence of dozens of independent air transport firms and 
airlines. A problem arose in the training of specialists for the 
ATC Service: as a result of the collapse of the USSR, the 
principal centers training air traffic controllers turned out to 
be outside Russia--in Riga and Kirovograd. As before, the ATC 
Service continues to be inadequately provided with technical 
equipment. More than 40 percent of the equipment in use is now 
worn out. This figure will be doubled in about 5 years. I do not 
think I have to say what this will mean for Russian aviation as 
a whole. To all this we have to add the fact that there are 
numerous budgetary--and not only budgetary--enterprises and 
organizations that are going through these difficult times, with 
chaos in the economy, inflation, and galloping price increases... 
  The country's airspace is divided into eight zones today. 
The 
total length of airways in Russia is 600,000 kilometers; there 
are 125,000 kilometers of international airways and 300,000 
kilometers in the upper airspace. There are more than 2,500 
airports, including 400 main airports and 29 international 
airports. About 500 airports are equipped with technical and 
flight support facilities. Only 12 of the 132 rayon ATC centers 
are equipped with secondary radar facilities. Only the two 
integrated ATC rayons--Moscow and Rostov--have rayon automated 
ATC systems. The Moscow Air Traffic Zone and the rayons for 
another 11 airports have automatic airport ATC systems with a 
varying degree of automation. Eighteen Russian airports meet 
ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization] Category I 
requirements and six airports meet Category II requirements. 
  The remaining ATC rayons and airports have mostly obsolete 
equipment and do not meet ICAO requirements. Naturally, this has 
a negative effect on the quality of support for flights in 
Russian airspace and does not enable us to fully provide for the 
needs of foreign airlines interested in flights over our 
territory. 
  But this is not the only problem. Unfortunately, I have to 
state that the level of our air traffic safety is declining. In 
1990 it was nearly 1.5 times lower than the average level of 
countries in the ICAO and three to four times lower than the 
level of air traffic safety in the United States. Unless steps 
are taken, the level of air traffic safety in Russia by the year 
2000 will be four times lower than the average level in ICAO 
countries and six times lower than in developed countries. 
  Well, there is one more fact that is not very pleasant. The 
annual economic losses incurred by airspace users because of 
deficiencies in our ATC system add up to about 1.2 billion 
rubles and no less than 70 million American dollars. Inefficient 
consumption of aviation fuel is reaching nearly 1 million metric 
tons. 
  So the newly formed Commission for Air Traffic Control, 
"Rosaeronavigatsiya," has to resolve a considerable number of 
complex and important problems. But one's hands accomplish what 
intimidates the eye, as they say. In April last year, the 
Russian Government issued the Decree "On modernizing the Unified 
System for Organizing Air Traffic in the Russian Federation." In 
addition, there is an order from the Russian minister of 
transportation separating the subunits engaged in air traffic 
control and the operation of electronic and communications 
equipment from those civil aviation enterprises that are being 
converted to shareholding and privatized. The measures 
stipulated by these documents are aimed primarily at stopping 
the ATC Service's slide into a deep crisis and at creating 
prerequisites for the organization of state enterprises which 
organize and control air traffic based on ATC services which 
have been separated from the structures of airports and 
airlines. Later on, these organizations will be united in the 
Russian system for airspace use and air traffic control. 
"Krasnoyarskaeronavigatsiya," the Moscow and Rostov AUVD 
[Automated ATC] centers, "Tyumenaeronavigatsiya," and other 
enterprises have already joined the "Rosaeronavigatsiya" system 
as independent structures. 
  It is planned--and this is particularly important--to 
implement the principle of state regulation of activity 
associated with airspace use and in the technical field, the use 
of the latest achievements of science and technology, including 
advanced space equipment and technology. 
  The Program for Organization of Air Traffic in the Russian 
Federation Up to the Year 2005 has also been drafted. The 
program takes into account the plans for modernizing the 
existing system which are already being implemented, as well as 
the plans developed by the international GATCC consortium and 
the French Thompson-CSF firm. Everything set forth in the 
program has been coordinated with the corresponding programs in 
the ICAO European region and is aimed at interaction and 
integration with foreign systems for air traffic organization 
based on unified standards, technologies, and technical 
facilities. 
  In 10 or 11 years, the domestic system for OVD [air traffic 
organization] will be provided with new equipment of higher 
quality. Satellite systems for communications, navigation, and 
observation will be in active use; they will provide support for 
flights by "looking" at the lowest altitudes and in the rayons 
hardest to reach. Adaptive automated ATC systems with elements 
of artificial intelligence; digital flight control and 
navigation complexes for aircraft which make it possible to fly 
automatically from takeoff to landing; highly accurate 
interrogating secondary radar; aircraft landing systems in the 
centimetric-wave band; aircraft collision warning systems; and a 
great deal more which we can only dream about today will make 
their appearance. 
  Work is already under way to implement the first part of 
this 
program. Over the next 2 years, we will modernize the 
organizational and functional structure and the financing 
mechanism to provide for the operation and development of air 
traffic organization, as well as technical equipment of 
international airways; introduce resource-saving technologies in 
air traffic control; and carry out scientific testing of 
elements in the future system--primarily satellite 
communications and navigation facilities. We will also have to 
resolve the problem of training specialists for our service. A 
world-class ATC operations simulation center will be established 
in Moscow and an ATC training center will be established in 
Krasnoyarsk. 
  The program's second stage provides for creation of 
technical 
infrastructure, based on satellite communications and navigation 
facilities, capable of unimpeded functional and territorial 
expansion and rapid increase in the throughput system where this 
is necessary. The air traffic organization system will acquire 
on-board and ground-based facilities to ensure flight safety and 
regularity and reduce the inefficient uses of airspace. 
  In the year 2001, implementation of the third part of the 
program will become a reality: the requirements of airspace 
users for OVD services will be fully met and our system will be 
integrated with the regional system of Western Europe. After the 
year 2005, we will be able to speak about integrating the 
Russian system for air traffic organization with the world air 
navigation infrastructure. 
  Thus far I have spoken about the work planned for the 
future. 
But we have quite a few daily tasks which are no less important 
than those incorporated in the long-term programs. For example, 
we attach a great deal of importance to the expansion of airways 
and their straightening. The latter is especially important, 
because it enables us to reduce flight time and save fuel. We 
are devoting our main attention today to the international 
routes, and that is understandable, since by expanding them and 
bringing our technical equipment up to date, we are attracting 
foreign shippers and hence an influx of capital and foreign 
exchange. 
  It must be said that the managers in local areas, meaning 
the 
heads of administrations in various rayons and krays, are giving 
us all kinds of support, because they realize that in the final 
analysis, increasing the activity of foreign air shippers will 
have a positive effect on the economic development of their 
regions. 
  We are also collaborating actively with foreign partners. 
They in turn are showing interest in cooperation with us, for 
the shortest route to countries of the Asia-Pacific region for 
many Western airlines is through Russia's territory. Last year 
more than 10 new international airways were opened in the Far 
East alone. An international air route from Western Europe to 
Tokyo which will be 400 kilometers shorter than the current 
Trans-Siberian mainlines is now being developed. Financing and 
modernization of ATC air navigation facilities on this airway, 
as well as the designing, construction, and equipment of control 
towers with technical facilities, are being arranged with the 
help of domestic and foreign firms. 
  We have held talks with American firms such as Delta and 
Alaska [Airlines] and Booz, Allen and Hamilton, and with 
representatives of the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency [sic]. We are 
coordinating new international air routes and the conditions for 
their use with them. We are not refusing economic assistance 
from our American partners. Thus, the U.S. Trade and Development 
Agency has provided a grant to establish the technical and 
economic feasibility to build a simulation complex to train air 
traffic controllers and modernize the ATC system in the Far East. 
  One journal article is not sufficient to describe all 
aspects 
of the Commission for Air Traffic Control. But I hope I have 
succeeded in throwing light on the main objective of 
"Rosaeronavigatsiya"--to build a system for organizing air 
traffic that aircraft crews and passengers flying in Russia's 
airspace will associate with concepts such as reliability and 
safety.

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Krygin, chief designer of the Design </F>
Bureau imeni N.I. Kamov: "The Pilotless Ka-37"] 
  [Text] The idea of developing a pilotless helicopter began 
at our design bureau in the early 1970's. Its use in various 
sectors of the economy can be feasible and advantageous for 
economic and ecological reasons. For example, for aerial 
photography, the transmission and relay of television signals, 
patrolling oil and gas pipelines, monitoring the radiation level 
at nuclear power plants, and determining the pollution of 
chemical enterprises. Recently, the equipment and methods for 
using pilotless helicopters in agriculture were developed 
effectively. Our Ka-37 was adapted to operate with a sprayer to 
atomize small amounts of toxic chemicals. The tests conducted 
showed that 50 kilograms is the optimum payload for this version. 
  The helicopter has the coaxial configuration which is 
traditional for the KB [Design Bureau] imeni N.I. Kamov. As 
applied to the pilotless version, it has a number of advantages 
over the single-rotor configuration. Primarily because the 
coaxial arrangement rules out a loss of power to the drive for 
the tail rotor. This makes it possible to use full engine power 
to develop thrust for the main rotor. In addition, the coaxial 
arrangement makes it possible to build an aircraft with smaller 
dimensions. And the airflow from the coaxial rotors ensures high 
quality in the application of chemicals to agricultural crops. 
Incidentally, the two-bladed main rotors, each 4.8 meters in 
diameter, are made of light but very strong composition 
materials. 
  The aircraft is controlled by commands from the autopilot. 
This is done with the aid of electrical steering mechanisms 
installed in the collective-pitch channels--for longitudinal, 
lateral, and yaw control. The engines' throttle butterflies are 
also controlled by an electrical steering mechanism. 
Technically, the helicopter may be controlled by an operator 
with a specially-equipped console on the ground. In this case, a 
person controls the position of the helicopter visually or in 
accordance with information displayed on the monitor of a 
personal computer. In addition to flight control information, 
the display shows certain parameters which indicate the 
efficiency of the basic systems.

<H8>  Structural Features </H8>
  The helicopter's fuselage consists of three compartments; 
electronic equipment is positioned in two of them, fore and aft, 
and all the main units and systems are in the central 
compartment. The central compartment is the principal 
load-carrying member which accommodates internal loads. It 
consists of two metal frames, a reinforced floor, nonremovable 
side panels and removable upper panels. When the upper panels of 
the central compartment are removed, the load-carrying unit, 
which is assembled separately and consists of the gearbox and 
two engines, may be installed in the helicopter. In order to 
facilitate installation of this unit, the forward frame is 
tilted to the front to increase space in the upper part of the 
central compartment. The load-bearing floor was built as a 
three-layer panel with a honeycomb filler and skin made of 
composition material. There are two wide-diameter openings in 
the floor for cooling air to reach the engine fans. Four 
brackets for the gearbox mount are installed in the floor's 
upper surface. Underneath four attachment points are installed 
in the floor for the sprayer tank and the skid-type landing gear. 
  The aft compartment consists of a frame and the tail boom. 
It 
is attached with fittings and four bolts. A duralumin bulkhead 
is attached to the frame which separates the hot compartment for 
the power plant from the tail compartment. The tail boom has a 
cone-shaped load-bearing skin made of fiber glass, reinforced 
with metal diaphragms and a frame at the point where it is 
attached. Fiber glass stringers have been glued to the cone 
portion of the tail boom to provide the rigidity needed. There 
are brackets in the tail compartment for installation of a radio 
altimeter and the transmitter-receiver unit for the Doppler 
sensor of slipping speed. The empennage, consisting of a fixed 
stabilizer with an adjustable elevator and two fixed vertical 
fins positioned at the end of the stabilizer, is attached to the 
end of the tail boom. There is a small hatch in the lower part 
of the tail boom through which the magnetic plug of the gearbox 
can be inspected. 
<H8>  The Power Plant </H8>
  The power plant consists of two P-037 piston engines, the 
gearbox, the gearbox mount, and the fuel system. The engine and 
gearbox were developed at the Samara Engine Building Design 
Bureau under the supervision of Chief Designer N. Trofimov. The 
engines, gearbox, and gearbox mount form a single unit. The 
gearbox is attached to the frame by seven bolts. Each engine is 
installed directly on the gearbox by two studs and two bolts. 
  The piston engine is a two-cycle, two-cylinder engine with 
cylinders in opposing configuration, carburetor mixing and 
forced-air cooling. Air for cooling the hot parts of the engine 
is supplied by a centrifugal fan installed on the crankshaft. 
Air is taken from the fan for the needs of the helicopter's 
systems and to cool the muffler. The torque is transmitted from 
the other side of the crankshaft through a spring damper to the 
intake for the main gearbox. The fuel-air mixture is transferred 
from the carubretor to the manifold though a laminated-type pipe 
and valve. Ignition of the combustible mixture in both cylinders 
is produced by sparkplugs. Lubrication of all bearings is 
provided by the combustible mixture. 
  The resonator-type muffler has three chambers to ensure 
adequate efficiency. Air comes out of the muffler sufficiently 
cooled and slowed down significantly, which substantially 
reduces the overall noise level of the helicopter. 
  In order to warm the air in the carburetor when the 
temperature of the outside air is not favorable, the engine is 
equipped with an electric heater in the form of a gasket. It is 
installed at the point where the carburetor is connected to the 
branch pipe. Each engine is supplied with independent fuel 
supply, ignition, and cooling systems. The carburetor, which is 
the main unit in the fuel supply system, has a built-in 
diaphragm pump. Fuel flows to the carburetors by gravity feed 
through pipes from the tank. The welded 13-liter aluminum tank 
is located above the engines in the upper part of the central 
compartment. The tank rests on four supports and is attached to 
them by tension clamps. The upper part of the tank has a filler 
with a cap and measuring stick. The fuel glass is attached to 
the gearbox mount by two bolts. It contains a sensor to indicate 
the remaining emergency fuel. The fuel is drained through an 
opened valve in the lower part of the glass. 
  The gearbox is designed to transfer power from the engine to 
the two coaxial two-bladed main rotors, as well as to their 
revolution sensors and the drives for oil pumps and brake 
shafts. It consists of a casing containing geared wheels, two 
clutches, and brakes for the main rotors. 
  The gearbox contains two-stage reduction gear. The first 
cylindrical stage provides the cumulative power from the two 
engines, and the second stage provides for distribution of power 
in four flows to the two output shafts turning at identical 
revolutions in different directions. For the engines to operate 
steadily during startup and when idling, automatic clutches, 
which also perform the functions of overriding clutches, are 
installed in the gearbox. The clutch is a friction clutch of the 
centrifugal type; it transmits torque to the main rotors when 
the engine is idling. When one engine fails or its revolutions 
are decreased, it is automatically disconnected from the 
gearbox. The latter has an independent lubrication and cooling 
system. Lubricant is provided by a pump for the gears and 
bearings and is fed through them to the gearbox oil reservoir by 
gravity. The oil reservoir is cooled by air from the axial-flow 
fan (mounted on the oil reservoir shaft) through ducts inside 
the gearbox. In low temperatures, the gearbox and its oil 
reservoir are warmed before startup through a connecting pipe by 
hot air from a ground-based source. 
<H8>  The Lifting System </H8>
  As already stated, the lifting system of the Ka-37 
helicopter 
is coaxial in configuration, with the blades attached flexibly 
to the hubs of the upper and lower rotors. The aircraft does not 
have the traditional horizontal, vertical, and axial hinges. 
Their functions are performed by a flexible torsion bar made of 
reglued rubber and composition material. Because it has no 
lubrication points, this construction simplifies operation of 
the lifting system and increases its reliability. The bodies of 
the hubs are made of steel forgings and are linked by hinges 
with the shafts of the upper and lower rotors of the gearbox. In 
order to avoid whipping of the rotors during runup, centrifugal 
limiters are installed on the output shafts of the gearbox. 
These limiters prevent the hinges of the hubs from operating 
when the rotors are turning at slow speed. The internal rings 
of the wobble plates are installed on ball supports to reduce 
the size of the column. The slide bars of the upper and lower 
rotors make use of sliding bearings. 
  The blades of both main rotors are made entirely of 
composition materials. Each blade is trapezoidal in shape; they 
are manufactured in a special device with the shape of its 
external surface. The mounting point of the blade is attached to 
it by four bolts. The blade itself is connected with the 
flexible hub by one special bolt. This makes it possible for one 
individual to remove all the blades from the helicopter when 
necessary within a few seconds and without the use of a tool. In 
order to simplify construction, the antiflutter weight is 
fastened to the outside of the blade. 
  The blades are controlled by four electrical devices. The 
output shafts of these devices rotate in one direction or 
another in accordance with electrical signals from the automatic 
control system. Actuators for the longitudinal and lateral 
control channel are positioned on the lower slide bar of the 
main rotor column. But the actuator for collective pitch is 
installed on the upper lid of the gearbox casing. The rotor 
pitch is increased or reduced by shifting the slide bar up or 
down on the gearbox shafts by the collective pitch mechanism. 
The actuator for directional control is mounted on the lower 
casing of the gearbox. This device increases or reduces the 
pitch only on the upper rotor. At the same time, so that there 
is no change in the helicopter's altitude, the autopilot gives 
the command to reduce or increase collective pitch, maintaining 
constant rotor thrust. 
  The actuator for engine control is located on the 
load-bearing floor of the central compartment. The throttle 
butterflies are opened or closed by a progressive-action device 
with the thrust system. The main rotors' brake is controlled 
through an electrical device installed on the first frame of the 
central compartment. 
  The skid-type landing gear consists of two titanium springs 
and two skids made of duralumin tubing. It is attached with 
bolts to four points on the lower surface of the load-bearing 
floor. 
  A sprayer is installed on the helicopter for agricultural 
work involving chemical applications. It consists of a 50-liter 
welded tank and a centrifugal pump with an electric motor, which 
feeds the liquid through an overlapping valve to two booms with 
nozzles. The tank is attached by tension clamps to points on the 
lower part of the load-bearing floor in the central compartment. 
The tank has a filler with a cap on the left. There is an 
opening in its center through which an electric harness is 
passed--to connect with the ground-based system for supplying 
the helicopter on the parking ramp. The harness ends with a 
contact-breaking electric plug and socket unit, which enables it 
to be disconnected automatically from the ground-based source 
when the helicopter takes off. Antennas for the automatic 
control system are located on the lower part of the tank. 
  A 27-volt direct-current system provides electricity for the 
helicopter's units and apparatus in flight. Its source is a 
direct-current generator driven by the gearbox. Operation of the 
ignition system for the two engines, the electrical pump, the 
overlapping valve for the sprayer, and the automatic control 
system depend on the on-board electrical supply. In addition to 
the generator, a control and warning unit, an electrical filter, 
a junction box, and engine ignition units are included in the 
power supply. A secondary (reserve) source of power is provided 
in the automatic control system for reliability. 
  The automatic control system (SAU) was developed by us 
jointly with specialists from the "Kulon" firm (General Designer 
A. Novoselov). Together with the radio link and the transmitting 
and receiving unit on board, the automatic control system makes 
it possible to provide for automated flight as well as with the 
help of an operator through a control panel at some point on the 
ground. 
  Pre-startup preparation of the helicopter begins by 
connecting it to a ground-based power source. After starting the 
engines manually and adjusting them from idle to low power, the 
revolutions are stabilized and the automatic control system is 
shifted to power from the on-board generator. The program 
developed makes it possible to have the helicopter take off and 
hover against the wind at an altitude of 3 meters, accelerate 
and climb to the altitude needed for the path assigned, turn on 
the course needed, arrive at the point assigned, and fly on a 
standard path with the sprayer turned on. Upon completion of the 
spraying, the electric pump is turned off and the helicopter 
returns for a landing. 
  The entire cycle of flight may also be carried out under the 
control of an operator through commands transmitted on the radio 
link from the point on the ground. Flight control is either 
visual or by means of the control panel display. Computers with 
a unit of damping gyroscopes, sensors of angular accelerations, 
a system of air warnings, barometric and radio altimeters, and a 
Doppler sensor of slipping speed have been installed in the 
helicopter. 
  The control panel consists of a working position for the 
operator with levers for collective and cyclic pitch, as well as 
pedals for directional control. Everything needed for the 
pre-runup preparation of the helicopter's systems has been 
provided for here. The system for displaying information is 
based on the PC-AT-486 personal computer. The control panel is 
equipped with a power supply and communications. Before takeoff, 
the operator controls the helicopter by wire, and afterward by 
radio link commands. 
  A little over a year ago (3 March 1993), the Ka-37 took off 
on its first flight. Tests of this helicopter are now under way 
at our base. 
  Taking into account the experience accumulated, we propose 
that an entire family of pilotless helicopters for different 
purposes be developed in the future. The possibility of 
equipping them with engines of different power--both domestic 
and foreign engines--is being examined. It would be interesting 
to find out the opinion of GRAZHDANSKAYA AVIATSIYA readers and 
specialists who operate aviation equipment regarding the 
requirements for this kind of helicopter. We would appreciate 
receiving all suggestions which make it possible to expand the 
area of application of pilotless aircraft.

<F P=106> [Article by V.M. Usoskin, doctor of economic sciences, </F>
professor, and sector head of the Institute of World Economics 
and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences 
(IMEMO RAN): "Should We `Introduce' a Federal Reserve System?"] 
  [Text] The idea of the need to reform the Central Bank of 
Russia (CBR) on the model of the United States Federal Reserve 
System [FRS] has been more and more often expressed in the press 
recently. The latest evidence of this is an article in 
FINANSOVYE IZVESTIYA (No. 13, 31 March-6 April 1994), entitled 
"The Central Bank Is Ready To Establish a Federal Reserve 
System". Alluding to an interview with the responsible 
representative of the CBR, the article says that "there is no 
basic difference between an FRS and the CBR," that "they fulfill 
identical functions," that "the CBR is ready to start conversion 
to an FRS and the consolidation of regional administrations, 
reducing their number from 80 to 20," etc. If one compares these 
statements with other publications on this subject, it is 
essentially a question of "dispersing the power" of the CBR and 
turning over to the regional level the solutions to a number of 
important problems of credit policy and other functions. 
  The details of the plan being developed so far have not 
become public property and one can speak only of the general 
idea. It is a fact that the CBR in its present form has found 
itself little adaptable to fulfilling the role of coordinator 
and regulator of the processes in the monetary-credit sphere, 
under the conditions of the difficult transition of the 
country's economy to the market rails. With the departure from 
the planned-administrative model, control over monetary 
circulation and the movement of credit flows was serious 
weakened. No reliable and integral mechanism of financial 
management has been created yet, although individual elements of 
it are already springing up. Reform of the CBR is necessary and 
inevitable. 
  Quite a different matter is--how and in what forms to carry 
out the reform of the CBR. Should we take "as the basis" the 
structure and functioning mechanism of a "strong" foreign 
central bank, such as, for example, the United States FRS, or 
should we attempt, on the basis of a careful study of world 
experience, to create our own model of a CBR, oriented toward 
our potentials, economic conditions and the degree of 
development of the financial infrastructure and market 
relations? The second path is naturally preferable, although it 
requires more time and a large amount of preparatory work. The 
readiness with which our officials, without sufficiently 
thorough study of the problem and broad public discussion of it, 
are inclined toward the first variant is therefore puzzling. 
  Incidentally, this is not the only attempt to blindly 
"introduce" the FRS model on Russian soil, on the basis of 
superficial analogies. As far back as the period of preparing 
the Law on the USSR State Bank in 1990, the idea of a transition 
to a federal structure for the CBR (with the republic offices of 
Gosbank converted to "central banks of the republics") was 
discussed by the developers as some sort of a stunt to preserve 
the Union's unified banking system. This approach, stimulated by 
current political considerations and not based on a realistic 
model of the functioning of the institutions being created, is 
not very effective and fraught with serious losses. For example, 
the "Western" methods of credit regulation transferred from the 
1990 USSR law to Russian banking legislation were not 
efficiently activated because the appropriate conditions were 
lacking. 
  They say that "conversion to an FRS" can be accomplished 
rapidly and painlessly, that the functions of central banks 
throughout the world are identical. In reality, central banks 
everywhere control the emission of money, make monetary 
settlements on a nationwide scale, grant loans to commercial 
banks, fulfill the role of financial agent for the Treasury, 
etc. Here the analogy ends, however, for all central banks solve 
the problems facing them in a different way. The relations of 
these banks with the government and Ministry of Finance are 
different, the set of administrative and market methods of 
regulation when following a credit policy are different, and the 
scale and forms of refinancing for commercial banks are 
different, and this is true not only for the CBR of Russia and 
the FRS of the United States, but also for the FRS, on the one 
hand, and the central banks of France, Japan, Germany and Great 
Britain, on the other. 
  Our legislators are primarily attracted to the FRS by its 
external facade--a decentralized structure that at first glance 
resembles Russia with its vast territory, existence of large 
regions with organized national economic complexes, and 
difficulty in central administration under the conditions of 
abolishing the iron discipline inherent in the 
administrative-bureaucratic model. Hence the natural impulse to 
copy the already prepared form. 
  One must, however, take into consideration the fact that the 
external decentralization of the central bank structure of the 
United States is the result of the long historical development 
of the banking sector in that country and the complex 
interweaving of political and socioeconomic factors. In the 
course of many years, a situation of conflict formed around the 
creation of the central bank in the United States. Small banks 
saw in the central bank an instrument of the dictates of the 
large banking associations. Industrialists wanted to establish a 
bank independent of government pressure and to ensure the 
stability of the monetary unit. Agrarians, however, defended the 
idea of decentralizing functions and inexpensive loans. 
  The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 is the model for the 
political commission. Its authors idea was that the 
"decentralizing principle" of the FRS was ensured by 
establishing 12 regional federal banks (one in each of the 
districts created for this purpose). These banks, in the 
aggregate, formed something like a "collective" central bank; 
their capital belonged to the member-banks of the FRS of the 
given district, and they represented local interests when a 
credit policy was formed. Centralization was achieved through 
the head agency of the system--the Federal Reserve 
Administration (subsequently--the FRS Board of Governors) in 
Washington. The members of the Board are appointed by the 
President of the United States with congressional approval. The 
law specifies a number of measures here to lessen FRS dependence 
on the executive power (the members of the Board are appointed 
for long terms--up to 14 years, the FRS has independent sources 
of income, etc.). 
  In the years that followed, the system underwent 
considerable 
evolution, the main result of which consisted of the narrowing 
of the autonomy of the federal banks and the establishment of a 
centralizing principle. Externally, however, the system 
preserved the features of a decentralized institution and its 
basic principles, incorporated in the Federal Reserve Act, were 
not changed. 
  The FRS differs considerably from other Western central 
banks, not only in its unique "three-stage" structure (Board of 
Governors-Federal Reserve Banks-FRS member-banks), but also in 
many functional features. It retains greater independence from 
the Treasury than many West European central banks, which are 
often directly subordinate to the force of edicts from the 
Ministry of Finance. The basic specific characteristic, however, 
is related to the system of regulating the monetary mass and 
interest rates. In contrast to the countries of Western Europe, 
where administrative (selective) methods of control, in the form 
of credit quotas and limits for individual sectors, groups of 
banks and major credit institutions are quite widespread, the 
FRS relies on the "classic triad" of common methods of credit 
regulation and rarely resorts to selective control. In this 
case, operations on the open market--buying and selling of state 
securities by the central bank--serve as the main means of 
operational regulation of the money market situation. 
  The basis of controlling credit flows is the system of 
minimum compulsory reserves, to which the FRS is bound by its 
title and which arose long before a central bank was established 
in the United States. As far back as the 1830's, legislation 
introduced a compulsory metal reserve that was to guarantee the 
bank notes being issued at that time by commercial banks. Later 
on, a multistage system of reserve guarantee of liability for 
deposits was formed, in which the provincial banks kept reserves 
for accounts in municipal banks, and these in turn--in banks of 
the main financial centers. This system led to a concentration 
of the demand for payment funds in large credit institutions, 
which in turn exacerbated the course of the financial crises. 
  With the formation of the FRS, the function of 
reserve-keeping was transferred to the regional federal banks, 
but in this case the guarantee-insurance role of the reserves 
moved to the background. Minimum reserves became the basis of 
the mechanism of centralized regulation of the credit market. 
  It should be particularly emphasized that, in contrast to 
other countries, the reserve accounts of the banks in the FRS 
are not a "depository" of money taken out of economic 
circulation; for these accounts the turnover passes through 
interbank transactions connected with the collection of checks 
and other payment documents through FRS, interbank loans, 
securities operations, etc. These are "live," actively 
functioning accounts, in which some banks temporarily accumulate 
excess funds, and others incur a deficit (as compared with the 
compulsory norm). The banks are constantly forced to correct 
their reserve position, and the FRS, through the reserves, can 
affect the volume and structure of banking operations and, 
consequently, the credit market situation. The actual process of 
correction is very complicated, and it is hard to predict its 
ultimate outcome. The FRS does not try to determine how the 
credit infusions into the economy will be used. It tries to 
influence the general financial climate in the country, at the 
level of interest rates. 
  Of the three "classic" instruments--the normative of 
compulsory reserves, the rediscount rate, operations on the open 
market--the latter, as was stated above, becomes the basic 
support. The norms for compulsory reserves in the United States 
have rarely and very carefully been changed in the last few 
years (for example, with respect to time and Eurodollar 
deposits, the last change was in December 1990, and for 
transaction accounts--in December 1992). It is felt that this is 
too drastic a means and is unsuitable for everyday corrections. 
  As for the crediting of the central banks at the rediscount 
rate, the federal reserve banks carry out these operations 
selectively and in minimal amounts, acting as a "creditor in the 
last instance." In May 1993, unpaid FRS loans to commercial 
banks constituted $128 million, that is, a little over 
three-hundredths of a percent of the total sum of the FRS assets 
on this date. 
  On the other hand, the FRS carries out operations in buying 
and selling large consignments of state securities regularly, 
sometimes daily. The FRS management regards them as a means, 
more suited to American credit market conditions, of influencing 
business conditions--soft, easily dispensed and quickly 
producing an effect. The New York Federal Reserve Bank conducts 
operations on the open market through authorized dealers. The 
total of the operations varies within a range of from $1 million 
to $1 billion and more per day. The Federal Open Market 
Committee, which includes all seven managing members of the 
Board and the presidents of five federal banks (the latter 
periodically rotated), gives the instructions for carrying out 
the operations. It is also the main body for operative control 
of the credit policy. 
  Even a very fragmentary and incomplete survey of the special 
features of the FRS shows that it is a central bank system that 
does not conform to Russian conditions. The system of regulating 
monetary circulation and credit is based on an "active" 
mechanism of reserve coverage. At the same time, refinancing of 
commercial banks at the central bank rate is reduced to the 
minimum, and the main role is given to operations with state 
bonds, which in turn are based on the ramified secondary market 
of these bonds and a powerful dealer network. Such a market does 
not and will not exist in Russia in the foreseeable future, and 
the refinancing mechanism, in the form of a system of 
centralized loans, occupies the leading place in the CBR arsenal 
for the time being. 
  "Conversion to an FRS" would entail a lot of large and small 
problems, which are sometimes difficult to foresee. Let us take 
an apparently technical question such as the arrangement of 
federal districts and determination of their size. In the United 
States, this question had an underlying political factor, since 
the goal in creating the FRS was to prevent a concentration of 
economic power in any financial grouping. The size of the 
district territory and the number of banks on this territory 
were regarded as the "balancing" factor. In the northeast, where 
the most powerful banks were located, several small reserve 
districts were created. For example, the New York Federal 
District includes the state of New York and part of the state of 
New Jersey. At the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York accounts for 25 percent of all the FRS assets. In the 
midwest and western United States, where there were no large 
banking associations, the federal reserve districts cover vast 
territories. Let us now picture Russia's "federal reserve 
system." What principle of federal division should be chosen, if 
one takes into consideration the tremendous differences in the 
development of the banking structures, the plurality of 
Federation constituents, the "war of sovereignties," etc.? 
  Consequently, when selecting a model for the CBR in Russia, 
we must make use of the wealth of experience accumulated by the 
world banking fellowship. At the same time, however, there must 
be thorough and painstaking preliminary work, a comparison of 
the experience of different countries and a selection of the 
forms that are promising under the specific conditions of the 
transitional period. In any case, when solving such a crucial 
problem, we must not be guided by superficial analogies and the 
political considerations of the moment.

<F P=106> [Accountability Report on the Work of the Council of the </F>
Association of Russian Banks in 1991-1993 by S. Ye. Yegorov, 
president of the Association of Russian Banks] 
  [Text] The Fourth Congress of the Association of 
Russian Banks was held in the Hall of Columns of the House of 
Unions in the city of Moscow on 21-22 May 1994. It heard the 
report of the Council of the Association of Russian Banks and 
summed up the association's activity in 1991-1993. 
  The congress elected the association's leading bodies 
for the next 5 years and determined the amounts of membership 
dues for 1994. 
  Sergey Yefimovich Yegorov was elected president of the 
association. 
  The Council of the Association was elected. 
  Dear participants in the congress! 
  We have gathered to hold a regular congress at a time quite 
difficult for Russia. Despite the steps taken to reach civic 
accord, the political fight is being aggravated. I also have to 
state with regret that the situation in the economy continues to 
worsen. The intensification of the decline in production in 
material production sectors, primarily in industry, and the 
worsening financial instability are the most conclusive evidence 
of this. 
  Judging by everything, Russia is entering a new and, 
possibly, the most crucial and complex stage in the 
implementation of reforms--a period, which will be accompanied 
by mass bankruptcies and a rise in unemployment. It is no 
accident that I begin my address with a description of the not 
very joyful situation in which the country is, because it is 
difficult to overestimate the public role that the banking 
system as a whole and the system of commercial banks in 
particular plays today. The degree of our participation and 
influence on the adoption of appropriate decisions by state 
structures will largely depend on how we see the situation 
arising in the country, what ways of getting out of the crisis 
we are able to outline and propose, what is the degree of our 
consensus on these matters, and how seriously and unitedly we 
intend to implement our views. 
  Obviously, I need not speak about the causes predetermining 
the situation in which the country is. I will permit myself to 
mention only those that hang, literally with weights, on the 
ailing legs of our economy and the absence of a decision on 
which will inevitably have the most negative effect on the 
interests of all, including those present at this congress: 
  --the unwinding and self-reproducing spiral of nonpayments, 
which clearly attests to the systems crisis in the economy; 
  --the lack of any price regulation, which threatens to lead 
before long to complete noncompetitiveness on foreign markets 
even of goods of our traditional raw-material export; 
  --the excessive level of interest rates, which threatens to 
stifle not only industry, but also any trade, in the very near 
future; 
  --the anti-investment environment (sociopolitical, economic, 
and legal); 
  --the lack of sources of foreign financing for economic 
restructuring. 
  Discussing the results of activity of the Association of 
Commercial Banks and its council, we must not merely remember 
the situation existing in the country, but also try to formulate 
our view of possible and expedient solutions of the urgent 
problems that I have mentioned above. 
  As I have already said, the activity of the Association of 
Russian Banks and its council, as well as of all commercial 
banks, during the period under review took place under 
conditions of a deep sociopolitical crisis in society, 
unprecedented decline in the economy, disarray in monetary 
circulation, and extremely high inflation rates. On top of it 
all the situation began to be aggravated by the payment crisis. 
I will cite only several facts: According to the data of the 
State Committee for Statistics, in 1993 the gross domestic 
product decreased by 12 percent as compared with 1992 and by 30 
percent as compared with 1991. National income decreased to more 
than one-half. Prices rose 10-fold. In 1993 monthly inflation 
was at the level of 15 to 20 percent. The federal budget deficit 
totaled 25 trillion rubles, or more than the revenue part of the 
budget. Unemployment officially recorded by the State Employment 
Service makes up approximately 1 percent of the total labor 
resources (750,000 people), although hidden unemployment is 
estimated by experts at 10 to 11 million people. A total of 33 
million people live below the minimum living standard. 
  In March of this year the government has worked out some 
measures to stabilize the situation and government forecasts for 
1994 presuppose a certain improvement in the situation: 
reduction of inflation to one-half, halt in the rates of decline 
in production (8 to 10 percent), stabilization of investment 
volumes, and the federal budget deficit at a level not over 6 
percent of the gross domestic product. However, the results of 
work during the first quarter of this year do not confirm the 
reality of these measures: Industrial output decreased by 24.9 
percent as compared with the first quarter of 1993 and in March, 
by 27.4 percent as compared with March of last year. This is a 
record decline in production during all the years of 
restructuring. 
  At the same time, it is obvious that an improvement in the 
economy will not occur automatically. There is a need for the 
continuation and intensification of reforms and their correction 
in a number of directions on the part of the government and the 
parliament and, of course, it is very important that commercial 
banks be really drawn into this process of correction and 
development, in particular, of the goal-oriented program for 
financial stabilization. 
  Today we are worried by a fundamental question: Will reforms 
develop in the economy and society? Banks are directly 
interested in their continuation, because a new credit system 
has appeared as a result of economic transformations and, in 
turn, without an adequate banking system reforms are simply 
impossible. 
  Undoubtedly, significant changes have already occurred in 
the 
economy. The command and distribution system has been destroyed. 
Price liberalization, establishment of an infrastructure of the 
market economy, and privatization of state property are real 
facts. 
  At present, however, the state of economic reforming has 
seemingly come to a standstill. The market in its varieties is 
developing poorly. This concerns financial and stock markets, 
the manpower market, and the land and real estate market. The 
tax system tries to an ever greater extent to improve 
entrepreneurship in all its forms. The state permits itself the 
luxury of not paying for products under its orders and does not 
settle accounts concerning preferential credit with banks. In 
our credit and banking sphere we observe attempts at a direct 
command by authorities at all levels and a return to the 
distribution system. 
  The decree dated 4 March of this year "On the Situation of 
the Russian Economy and Prospects for Its Development in 1994" 
provides for the implementation of a moderately tight credit and 
monetary policy in the current year. In principle, we agree with 
this, but it is important to determine methods of realizing this 
direction. We do not understand the circumstance that the 
government credit commission determines the allocation and 
distribution of centralized credits. In a number of oblasts and 
krays this procedure spreads and local credit commissions are 
also established there, trying to command banks. This is direct 
confirmation of the return to the distribution economy and 
disregard for market mechanisms. 
  Adopting any decisions concerning reforms, bodies of state 
management seem not to note the newly established 
entrepreneurial sectors of the economy and do not lean on their 
unions, groupings, and associations. Yet it is precisely here 
that all problems of entrepreneurship are accumulated and they 
are ready to participate in the drafting of fundamental 
documents on economic development. 
  Basic directions in credit and monetary policy are developed 
and decisions on it are adopted by a narrow circle of workers in 
the system of the RF Central Bank. As experience shows, it 
suffers from very important miscalculations. In our opinion, 
representatives of all participants in the market economy, 
primarily commercial banks, which are the financial and economic 
base for the market economy, should participate in the drafting 
of this document. We have been saying for a long time that a 
banking committee should be established from among bank 
representatives, scientists, and entrepreneurs. For now, 
however, this remains only a wish. 
  Reforms need competent state administration and the 
parliament must establish the legal basis for reforms as quickly 
as possible. 
  Informing you about the state of Russia's economy and 
finances and analyzing the conditions under which commercial 
banks have to operate, I assume that every bank, when working 
out the strategy of activity for the current year, should take 
into account the economic processes that are taking place not 
only on the scale of activity of a specific bank, but also the 
processes that are developing at Russia's macroeconomic level. 
  Despite the very complex conditions under which banks have 
to 
operate, the new credit system is developing and adapting to the 
market to an ever greater extent. Reform in the banking sphere 
outstrips transformations in other economic sectors. As of 1 
April 1994 there were 2,041 banks with 4,660 affiliates (without 
the Savings Bank) in Russia. Last year the Central Bank 
registered 306 independent banks, or almost as many as in 1992. 
The declared authorized capital of commercial banks exceeds 1 
trillion rubles and in 1993 it increased 10-fold. The amount of 
assets is more than 110 trillion rubles. At the end of 1993 the 
amount of banks' credit investments totaled 24.5 trillion rubles. 
  A total of 11 banks, the authorized capital of which 
exceeded 
10 billion rubles, appeared in Russia for the first time. 
  I would like to especially stress the qualitative changes in 
bank operation. Undoubtedly, these are not the banks that were 4 
or 5 years ago. They, like sponges, absorb everything that is 
advanced in world banking experience, primarily modern banking 
technologies. A number of banks have become members of the SWIFT 
international settlement system, have mastered plastic cards in 
settlements, have introduced fundamentally new forms of bank and 
personnel management on the basis of modern computers, have 
greatly expanded the range of services provided to clients, and 
have improved services for the public. As of 1 April of this 
year the share of the population's deposits rose to 40 percent 
of the total amount, while in the Savings Bank it decreased to 
60 percent. 
  The figures cited above seemingly point to a large number of 
banks. However, an analysis shows that our economy is by no 
means saturated with credit institutions. If we exclude Moscow 
banks and banks of two and three other large economic centers, 
it will turn out that in the absolute majority of administrative 
regions there is one banking institution per region and 
sometimes not even this. This will not help economic 
development, small and medium-size business, farming, and the 
entire entrepreneurial sector. 
  Under conditions of high inflation rates there is also a 
problem with the amounts of banks' ownership capital. The 
authorized capital of more than two-thirds of the total number 
of banks is below 500 million rubles. Although in the economy 
there should also be small banks, an increase in bank liquidity 
is connected to a considerable degree with the amounts of 
ownership capital. We realize that under conditions of the 
shortage of funds literally in all economic sectors it is not 
simple to do this. Nevertheless, it is necessary to increase 
bank capital. 
  Incidentally, the campaign for summing up bank activity in 
1993 indicates that the absolute majority of banks assigned the 
basic amount of profit for an increase in their capital and the 
amount of dividends was determined much below inflation rates. 
  However, solving the problem of increasing bank capital, we 
must take into account the real financial resources of the 
economy, which are extremely meager in all its sectors. 
Furthermore, it is necessary to have the entire "assortment" of 
banks--large, medium-size, and small, which world practice 
confirms. The orientation of the Central Bank only toward large 
banks is highly disputable. You know that as of 1 March of this 
year the Central Bank set the minimum amount of the authorized 
capital of newly established banks at 2 billion rubles and in 5 
years they must increase ownership capital to 5 million ECU (10 
billion rubles), as is now accepted in the European Community. 
Under conditions of the acute shortage of funds this task is too 
difficult for the overwhelming number of peripheral banks--this 
will require 30 trillion rubles. 
  The Central Bank has permitted the establishment of new 
banks 
with authorized capital ranging from 500 million to 2 billion 
rubles for the performance of a limited range of operations. 
They have no right to keep clients' current accounts and to 
attract funds for a period of less than 1 year. Clients will 
hardly need such "banks." 
  In addition to the negative consequences noted above, the 
decision of the Central Bank will lead to the fact that the bulk 
of currently operating banks will be in a difficult situation. 
Many of them clearly realize that they will not be able to 
increase the amount of capital to 5 million ECU within the 
planned period and, therefore, have no prospects for further 
development. As is well known, a lack of prospects always is a 
destructive force. Banks are already informing the Association 
of Russian Banks that there will not be an increase, but an 
outflow, of capital from such banks, because shareholders are 
not interested in investing funds in an unpromising business. 
  As I have already stated above, the Association of Russian 
Banks, undoubtedly, supports the direction toward an increase in 
the capital of banks and in their liquidity. However, it is 
advisable to solve this problem in stages, depending on the 
financial resources of economic regions and with due regard for 
the sphere of bank activity, as we proposed last year. We 
informed the State Duma and Central Bank Chairman V. 
Gerashchenko of our position. It is important that participants 
in the congress also express their opinion on this matter. 
  I want to submit for your discussion a matter concerning 
various nonbanking organizations, which, having no licenses, 
attract and place funds, that is, perform the same functions as 
banks do, but without licenses. These are financial companies, 
funds, financial and industrial concerns, and so forth, which, 
advertising the computation of a high interest--700 to 1,000 
percent and higher--withdraw large amounts of the population's 
funds for questionable operations. These organizations are 
registered in the Ministry of Finance, but are not subject to 
supervision. Their deposits are not insured. People who deposit 
funds in them are subject to risk. Such organizations discredit 
the banking system before the population, their activity does 
not conform to banking legislation, and often simply swindlers 
are at work in them. The Association of Russian Banks addressed 
a proposal to the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the 
State Tax Service to prohibit them from performing banking 
operations. The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance 
supported our opinion and we hope that we will be able to 
jointly solve this problem. 
  There is another "burning" question. For many banks it is 
now 
the question of life or death in the literal sense of this word. 
In the current year a significant number of banks may cease 
their existence for three reasons: owing to the nonreturn of 
loans and general insolvency, loss of substantial funds in 
operations with forged letters of advice and "Rossiya" checks, 
and unprofitable activity. These are new phenomena in Russia's 
banking system and they require serious thought. It cannot be 
permitted that the collapse of one bank should entail the 
bankruptcy of other banks and their clients. For banking 
activity, which is connected with a high risk, in Western 
countries the bankruptcy of several banks is an ordinary 
phenomenon. However, a mechanism for the prevention of 
bankruptcy and support of banks, which experience difficulties, 
operates in all countries. 
  If a bank has temporary difficulties with payments not 
through its fault, it is necessary to provide for measures so 
that losses for other banks and, especially, for depositors be 
minimal. Unfortunately, this subject, essentially, has not been 
studied in our country, primarily at the Central Bank. When 
financial complications arise, the Central Bank uses only one 
remedy--deprivation of licenses. Essentially, preventive and 
therapeutic measures with a sick bank are not taken. Of course, 
every bank, first of all, should have its own reserves for the 
recovery of losses on loans. However, in world practice other, 
external, methods of support for banks, when they have 
difficulties, with the participation of central banks and 
governments have also been developed. 
  Our Central Bank has collected substantial amounts of money 
of commercial banks in three funds: in reserve accounts, in the 
bankruptcy insurance fund, and in the deposit insurance fund. 
However, during past years this money has virtually not been 
used for the support of banks experiencing difficulties. 
Probably, this can be attributed to the fact that an entire 
package of measures concerning state regulation of the banking 
sphere has not been formed in our country. 
  For example, in the United States, in order to maintain 
current liquidity, commercial banks can receive loans in the 
Federal Reserve System. This method is very effective and prompt 
in order not to cause a mass withdrawal of deposits from a bank 
experiencing difficulties. However, the insurance deposit 
corporation is the main body providing support for banks. It 
performs its functions by three methods. The first: It issues 
sureties or guarantees to a bank experiencing financial 
difficulties. Second: It carries out the merging of banks, which 
arouse apprehension, with bigger ones. Third: It makes insurance 
compensation payments to owners of deposits through the 
bankruptcy procedure. 
  The Association of Russian Banks has persistently sought the 
separation from the Central Bank of functions connected with 
deposit insurance into an independent organization. In January 
of this year the Central Bank has adopted the decision to stop 
collections of money from banks into this fund. However, there 
is no deposit insurance committee or corporation. The 
Association of Russian Banks is preparing its proposals on this 
matter and we ask the State Duma, the government, and the 
Central Bank to take into consideration the acuteness and 
importance of this problem. 
  Discussing bank liquidity, we cannot keep silent about the 
quality of credit portfolios and the credit issue procedure. We 
recommended that commercial banks establish strict technology 
for the adoption of a decision on these matters. In our opinion, 
for this purpose credit committees consisting of highly skilled 
and principled specialists should be set up in all banks and a 
specific procedure for the preparation of materials for the 
committee meeting and personal responsibility for their quality 
should be established. As international and domestic practice 
has shown, the solution of such, as well as other, problems 
connected with individual management of bank assets is extremely 
dangerous and sooner or later will lead to bank failure. The 
difficulties, into which some commercial banks have gotten now, 
are connected precisely with this. 
  A financial market has begun to emerge in Russia. From the 
very beginning the Association of Russian Banks either initiated 
its organization itself, or helped its establishment in various 
forms by commercial banks. Moscow, St. Petersburg, and 
Novosibirsk interbank currency exchanges actively operate now. 
The Interbank Financial House, the Organizational Bank, 
subdivisions of the "Delovaya Rossiya" [Business Russia] Bank, 
and so forth have been established for trade in credit 
resources. The privatization of state property and the 
transformation of enterprises and banks into joint-stock 
companies strengthen the stock market. However, the refinement 
of the mechanism of the financial market and expansion of the 
volumes of transactions on it require additional efforts and 
initiative on the part of all participants in the market, 
including commercial banks. 
  Overdue payments are not only a big economic, but also 
social, problem. Owing to nonpayments, many enterprises are shut 
down and organizations of the social sphere stop their 
operation. There is a real threat of bankruptcy of enterprises 
and banks. 
  The government has repeatedly examined the state of overdue 
debts. A few days ago the Federal Council also discussed 
measures and adopted a decree, which took into account proposals 
by the Association of Russian Banks. However, despite 
resolutions and directives, as yet nothing has been done in 
reality and mutual debts make the economy and the population's 
social living conditions feverish. 
  Following the government report the Federation Council 
adopted a decree dated 7 April of this year "On the Crisis of 
Insolvency in the Russian Federation Economy," which reflected 
proposals by the Central Bank and our association for the 
restoration of solvency of enterprises. The realization of this 
decree will also make it possible to strengthen the financial 
situation of banks. It has a number of serious provisions: 
introduction of state wage regulation, reduction by the Central 
Bank of the discount rate of interest on credits, and 
reservation of funds for wages in accounts of enterprises. Their 
fulfillment can significantly affect mutual relations of banks 
with clients. Banks, which attract medium- and long-term 
resources with a high interest, should give thought to how the 
decision on lowering the discount rate of the Central Bank will 
affect their profitability. At the same time, however, they must 
take into consideration that such a measure can noticeably 
revive the credit activity of banks. Undoubtedly, wage 
regulation will affect primarily the banking system, because the 
highest wage level is in our sphere. 
  The Federation Council instructed the government to provide 
for measures to replenish the circulating capital of enterprises 
and to offset mutual debts. The association repeatedly addressed 
such proposals to the government and the former Supreme Soviet. 
We consider it to be a positive fact that superior bodies of 
power have finally understood this important problem and it will 
find its solution. At the same time, the question arises why the 
government, repeatedly discussing the problem of nonpayments, 
did not make a decision. After all, to regulate mutual relations 
in the area of the economy, in fact, is the function of the 
government, not the legislative function of the parliament. 
  At the same time, the Federal Assembly confirmed the need 
for 
an unconditional fulfillment of the president's edict dated 19 
October 1993 "On Improving Settlements in the Economy and 
Increasing Responsibility for Their Prompt Execution." As you 
remember, in this edict emphasis was placed on the processing by 
banks of promissory notes of enterprises on overdue debts. I 
would like to exchange views and to hear your proposals on how 
to best carry out such an operation, taking into consideration 
that the conditions necessary for the introduction of the 
promissory note turnover do not yet exist in Russia. 
  The Central Bank with our participation should work out 
forms 
of settlements between enterprises and banks. Advance payments, 
or the so-called prepayment, cannot remain the prevalent form: 
They maintain sellers' dictate with respect to purchasers of 
products and lead to a vast growth of debts. Buyers, 
transferring advances, lose control over their funds. They are 
not left even with a document confirming the receipt of money by 
suppliers. It is quite clear that the settlement system hampers 
the development of market relations, not to mention that it 
withdraws a vast amount of money from the turnover. 
  The International Coordinating Committee for Improvement in 
Russia's Payment System was established a year go. This 
committee includes representatives of the RF Central Bank, of 
the Association of Russian Banks, and of a number of commercial 
banks, as well as of such international organizations as the 
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the Commission of 
the European Communities, and central banks of the United 
States, France, Germany, and England. Proposals for the 
organization of intrabank settlements, interbank clearing, a 
system of transfer of big payments, and an informatization 
system, for the development of new financial tools, including 
promissory notes, and for the training and education of 
personnel in the field of settlements and informatization have 
been developed within the framework of this committee by now. It 
is only necessary to speed up the realization of these proposals. 
  The Association of Russian Banks will inform their members 
as 
work at the indicated sections is completed. 
  The organization of mutual economic relations and 
determination of optimum forms of mutual interstate settlements 
at the level of both central and commercial banks is a vitally 
important problem, which politicians and managers of banking 
systems in near abroad must solve. Life forces commercial banks 
to search for methods of settlements, essentially, blindly. The 
chief thing is that it is not clear along what path to build the 
system of mutual settlements: To completely give up the idea of 
the ruble zone of the new type and to give preference to 
payments in national currencies, or to find other variants 
combining both? In order to discuss this entire set of problems, 
the Association of Russian Banks, together with the Central Bank 
of Russia and the International Economic Savings Bank, plans to 
hold a banking conference "Possible Ways of Forming a System of 
Mutual Settlements With States in Near Abroad." 
  The poor state of accounting is one of the unsolved problems 
in banking. This is connected not only with the shortage of 
skilled accounting personnel, but also with the obsolete account 
plan and the absence of an efficient normative base and of 
methodological support for the financial reporting of banks. 
  At the end of last year commercial banks, as an experiment, 
began to draw up new financial reporting and new accounting 
standards. However, there are no new normative documents 
conforming to new banking legislation. The account plan and 
accounting and reporting rules approved in 1987 have become 
obsolete. Moreover, they come into conflict with a number of 
laws, in particular with the fundamentals of civil legislation, 
with the Law "On Ownership in the Russian Federation," and with 
the Law "On Banks and Banking Activity." 
  In our opinion, the accounting of commercial banks should 
gradually approach international standards. This means that 
accounting should be reliable and ensure a real evaluation of 
the results of activity and of the assets and liabilities of 
banks and the safety of the banking document turnover. In 
accordance with existing legislation the methodology of 
accounting is determined by the Central Bank, but its efforts in 
this, obviously, are insufficient. 
  We realize that the Central Bank has difficulties in 
connection with the departure of skilled personnel and we are 
ready to appeal to banks to establish a group from among 
specialists of commercial banks for the preparation of the 
necessary documents. 
  Since the beginning of reform investments have dropped by 
more than 50 percent. Undoubtedly, the decline in production, 
change in forms of ownership, and, especially, inflation have 
affected this. Owing to this, banks participate in investments 
approximately at the rate of 4 percent of all the credit 
investments. 
  On 21 March of this year the RF Government approved the 
"Temporary Statute on Financing and Crediting Capital 
Construction." We welcome such a step by the government. 
However, it concerns only state enterprises. Therefore, the 
distributive principle prevails in it. In our opinion, a system 
for granting credits for these purposes on the basis of an 
arrangement between clients and commercial banks with state 
support by means of interest on credit, so that enterprises may 
receive loans, as now, at an annual interest of 13 percent, 
would be an effective measure. 
  In our opinion, the government has not taken advantage of 
all 
the opportunities to attract funds for investments. The 
Association of Russian Banks has analyzed ways of reviving 
investment processes from this standpoint and addressed a 
special note to Government Chairman V.S. Chernomyrdin. For banks 
that put money in investments it is necessary to lower 
obligatory reserves, to make tax policy more favorable, to set 
apart the keeping of funds earmarked for these purposes, and so 
forth. Unfortunately, our proposals have not yet found a real 
way out. In our opinion, it is necessary to once again return to 
this matter, taking into consideration that the investment 
capacity in Russia's economy makes up 15 to 20 trillion rubles, 
while capital investments now total approximately 7.0 trillion 
rubles. 
  The association attentively examined the plans for the 
possible direction of investments prepared by the RF Ministry of 
Economics. In our opinion, the policy of big investment projects 
(with a recovery of 5 to 12 years), which prevail in these 
programs, will intensify inflation. Therefore, it does not 
correspond to the possibilities and tactics of implementation of 
investments. In our opinion, this plan, first of all, should 
contain projects primarily connected with an increase in 
consumer goods, processing of agricultural products, and 
production of equipment for small and medium-size business. This 
will make it possible to realize them more rapidly and to 
increase the mass of commodities and national income, which will 
actively promote a reduction in inflation rates. Such projects 
will accelerate the return of funds put in investment programs. 
  There is another source of investments, but it is of the 
nature of political decision-making. Unfortunately, Russian 
money circulates all over the world and one should not be 
surprised at this. The experience of other countries indicates 
that, when in a country there is a high level of inflation, 
extremely high interest rates, and unstable legislation and 
internal political situation, there is an outflow of capital. 
Fear of the possibility of regular confiscations from Russian 
entrepreneurs should be added to this--this is a fully 
understandable matter. Therefore, one should hardly be surprised 
that the currency earned by our entrepreneurs disappears from 
the country. If the political and economic situation and 
legislation in Russia had been more stable, undoubtedly, these 
dollars would have worked for our economy, that is, the 
effectiveness of investments in Russia's economy is very high. 
According to various evaluations, the amount of these funds in 
foreign banks ranges from 20 to 40 billion dollars. In order to 
return this vast amount of money, Russia's authorities should 
examine the method of guaranteeing owners of capital its safety. 
This path is more preferable to waiting to receive dollar 
credits from international financial organizations. In our 
opinion, a joint statement by the president, the Federal 
Assembly, and the government on guarantees to entrepreneurs 
returning capital to the country could be one of such measures. 
The Federal Assembly should adopt laws on such guarantees. It 
would not be superfluous to back such guarantees with our 
state's international obligations. 
  The economic situation also dictates an energetic decision, 
possibly, by involving commercial banks or their leading group 
in the problem of settlement of the country's foreign debts to 
the London Club. No matter how unpleasant the idea of increasing 
our debts to Western creditors may be, we must realize that, 
without settling the problem of rescheduling our debts and 
without readiness "to betray principles," we will not find 
foreign sources of financing our investment projects. 
  The regulation of the activity of commercial banks is one of 
the most complex problems of mutual relations of two links of 
one banking system. The contradictions arising in our country 
are also inherent in different forms in other countries with 
long existing banking systems. The problem lies in seeing to it 
that contradictions are not serious and are regulated in a 
civilized manner. 
  What matters worry our banks now? They are methods of 
supervision, the determination of economic normatives of 
activity, and the creation of favorable conditions for 
partnership relations of commercial banks with Central Bank 
organizations. A stable activity of commercial banks should be 
regulated by long-term normative documents of the Central Bank 
so that Central Bank organizations do not interfere in the 
current activity of banks. However, telegrams, which regulate 
current activity, as before, predominate in normative documents 
of the Central Bank. In European countries and the United States 
during the preparation of decisions on important matters central 
banks discuss them with commercial banks and bank associations. 
We, however, find out about decisions adopted by the Central 
Bank only when telegrams have already been sent to regional 
administrations of the Central Bank. The demand to increase as 
of 1 March the minimum amount of the authorized capital for new 
banks to 2 billion rubles is characteristic of this subject. 
  In principle, relations of commercial banks and of the 
Association of Russian Banks with the Central Bank have improved 
slightly, but remain complex. This concerns the regulation of 
the activity of commercial banks by the Central Bank, opening of 
affiliates, availability of consultations, and a flexible 
approach to difficulties arising in commercial banks. 
  The independence of the Central Bank often leads to direct 
arbitrariness with regard to commercial banks. Let us recall the 
writing off, without investigation, of funds from correspondent 
accounts of banks in connection with forged payment documents, 
entry of payments of over 100 million rubles in individual 
accounts, introduction of control by banks over the expenditures 
of clients' funds used by them for wages, exchange of money when 
banks were presented with a fait accompli and the population 
directed its anger at them. 
  At times the Central Bank is blindly guided by 
recommendations of international financial organizations, which 
are good in an established market economy. As before, the 
Central Bank issues an abundance of all kinds of constantly 
changing instructions and letters, which at times it is 
difficult to understand. 
  Previously, there was the practice of exaction of interest 
on 
credits once in a quarter. In the current year the Central Bank 
gave the instruction to exact interest from commercial banks 
every month. Such an instruction put many banks, especially 
those crediting seasonal sectors of the economy, in a difficult 
situation. Banks have been deprived of the possibility to 
maneuver their resources during the quarter and suffer great 
losses. 
  I have already discussed above the need to create fair 
conditions for the support of commercial banks on the part of 
the Central Bank, when for independent reasons temporary 
difficulties arise, so that two links of a single credit system 
may operate as partners and find mutual understanding. In all 
fairness it should be said that many chiefs of main 
administrations assist in the efficient operation of commercial 
banks in their regions. However, we receive constant complaints 
against formalism and even arbitrariness on the part of some of 
them with regard to commercial banks (Krasnodar Kray and Rostov 
and Novosibirsk [former chief of the main administration] 
oblasts). 
  The Executive Board of the Association of Russian Banks took 
part in the preparation of a number of normative documents by 
the Central Bank. Such a coordination, in the process of which 
there is a discussion of fundamental problems with associations 
of commercial banks, is useful, but is used very rarely. We 
again address to Mr. V.V. Gerashchenko the proposal to acquaint 
the association with drafts of normative documents so that the 
position of commercial banks may be taken into consideration. 
With such an interaction the quality of normative documents will 
improve. 
  Bringing normative documents of the Central Bank promptly 
and 
accurately to the notice of commercial banks is of great 
importance for their execution. Now this is done by a primitive 
method, with great delay, and often in distorted form. In a 
number of cases main administrations do not send copies of 
normative documents of the Central Bank, but give instructions 
in their statements. The Association of Russian Banks considers 
such a form of communication of normative documents undesirable. 
We ask Mr. V.V. Gerashchenko to include in the plan of 
distribution of normative documents all banks with the use of 
electronic mail and to introduce systems codification, which 
will be used by banks to control the receipt of Central Bank 
documents. 
  The laws on banks and banking activity adopted 3 years ago 
played their positive role. However, it must be stated that many 
of their provisions no longer meet the real needs of practice 
and a large number of problems have not been regulated at all at 
the legislative level. In connection with the intensification of 
economic reform and with due regard for the accumulated 
experience there is an urgent need to create full-weight banking 
legislation. 
  The Council of the Association of Russian Banks actively 
worked with the former Supreme Soviet and the president's 
administration on the preparation of new legislation. The 
association sent several versions of changes in and supplements 
to banking laws. 
  The question of how to act is now being discussed: To follow 
the path of making changes in and supplements to existing laws, 
or to draft fundamentally new ones? When solving this problem, 
apparently, we must take into account the fact that thus far the 
main law for all economic subjects has not yet been adopted--the 
Civil Code--and there is no concept for the further development 
of Russia's banking system, which should become the base for new 
banking legislation. 
  It seems that in this connection we must use both ways of 
solving this problem: While continuing to insist on the 
introduction of urgent amendments in existing laws, to actively 
produce material for new legislation. 
  We believe that a legislative base for seriously reforming 
the upper level of the banking system is needed. A number of 
functions now performed by the Central Bank divert its forces 
and attention from the solution of problems of credit and 
monetary policy and the combination of the partner and 
controller of commercial banks in one body gives rise to a 
formal administrative attitude on the part of the Central Bank 
apparatus toward banks. It is advisable to separate some 
functions of the Central Bank and to form independent bodies; 
for example, for deposit insurance and supervision over the work 
of commercial banks. 
  There is a proposal for the establishment of the National 
Council on Banks, in which all participants in the credit and 
monetary process--the Central Bank of Russia, commercial banks, 
representatives of the association, of the Ministry of 
Economics, and of financial bodies, and entrepreneurs--should be 
represented. This proposal deserves an examination and a 
corresponding legislative affirmation. Clarifying the concept's 
basic provisions, it is necessary to work out a draft law on 
Russia's banking system and to submit it to the State Duma for 
consideration. 
  It is important to more fully utilize useful foreign 
experience in the management and legal regulation of the 
monetary and credit sphere as a whole and in the organization of 
the central banking system, as well as the system of commercial 
banks, maximally stimulating the mastering of world banking 
standards in banking. However, this should be done with due 
regard for our specific features and, most important of all, 
real possibilities. 
  Speaking of the improvement in legislation regulating the 
activity of the commercial banks themselves, it must be said 
that laws should be of the nature of a direct effect and not 
consist of references to instructions of the Central Bank, the 
State Tax Service, and other departments. We assume that 
direct-effect laws regulating the system and procedure of 
payments, principles of crediting, mortgage, and problems 
concerning the development of competition and restriction of 
monopolism in the banking sphere and on bank holdings are 
needed. The top-priority ones include the problem of legislative 
regulation of the procedure for the formation of reserves in the 
Bank of Russia and the conditions of their use. 
  In work on improving banking legislation we count on the 
help 
of deputies of the State Duma, especially those that previously 
worked in commercial banks. In the new parliament the interests 
of banks are represented more competently than in the former 
Supreme Soviet. In the parliament the banking system cannot be 
in the background, as was before, but should act as an 
independent economic category, which in the West now is called 
the banking industry. The Association of Russian Banks supported 
banker candidates during elections, although we did not 
participate in political parties. Eight former bankers are 
represented in the Committee on the Budget, Taxes, Banks, and 
Finances. We hoped that in the Duma there will be an independent 
committee on banks. Unfortunately, however, leaders of political 
fractions did not listen to our opinion, proceeding from their 
party positions. Now, however, the structure of the committee 
has already been determined, we have established business 
contacts with it, and we will actively work together. 
  The unstable tax policy creates serious complications for 
the 
formation of the new banking system. Last year banks paid more 
than 1 trillion rubles in taxes. The tax burden does not make it 
possible to form ownership capital and to establish the material 
and technical base for banks. The high level of taxes and cost 
of credit undermines shareholders' interest in investing funds 
in banks, because they receive low dividends as compared with 
inflation rates. 
  The Association of Russian Banks pays much attention to the 
tax protection of banks both at the federal level and the 
microlevel, coming out in support of every bank. At the 
beginning of last year we managed to greatly reduce the tax on 
bank property and during the fourth quarter, to lower the 
taxable base of securities, certificates, and a number of other 
revenues. The Association of Russian Banks appealed to the State 
Duma and the Ministry of Finance in connection with a number of 
taxes and matters concerning them are being examined. 
  In its nature the tax on bank income was unfair and tougher 
than on profit. Any revenues were taken into account, but 
expenditures connected with the receipt of revenues and wage 
funds were not. The Association of Russian Bank attained the 
introduction for banks as of 1 January 1994 of taxation on 
profit as for all enterprises. If everything is calculated, it 
can be said without exaggeration that we managed to "save" many 
hundreds of billion of rubles for banks. 
  However, the general level of taxation on all economic 
sectors has risen during the current year. Furthermore, 
according to the president's edict, local bodies were given 
authority to introduce additional taxes. In connection with this 
the share of taxes paid into local budgets increases 
considerably and we recommend that you protect bank interests by 
common efforts in oblasts, krays, and republics during the 
preparation of draft decrees by local bodies. 
  In 3 years the Executive Board of the Association of Russian 
Banks organized the training of more than 7,500 people, 
including those that study now, in regular educational 
institutions. With the association's participation a network of 
base educational institutions, which have received teaching 
licenses, has been formed and measures to improve the skills of 
the teaching staff and study programs and to expand subjects 
have been implemented. 
  Together with the Finance Academy, the Central Bank, and a 
number of commercial banks, as well as French and English 
centers for personnel training, the Moscow Banking School was 
established. With the Academy of the National Economy imeni G. 
Plekhanov we participated in the establishment and work of the 
"Mirbis" School. The association itself carries out course 
activities for a number of professions: with lawyers, 
accountants, "key workers," and workers engaged in contacts with 
the public. 
  At the beginning of the current year the Academy of 
Management and the Market was established with our 
participation. A course on banking was prepared within its 
framework and it will be guided by the Association of Russian 
Banks. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is 
the program coordinator and sponsor. 
  We have managed to solve another important problem: To 
establish under the Association of Russian Banks the Center for 
Banking Consultations, the expenditures on the maintenance of 
which will be financed basically at the expense of Russian banks 
and the European Economic Community (5 million ECU). Consultants 
from Western banks and Russian specialists will work in the 
center. We have also come to an agreement with a number of 
foreign banks about the preferential training of our bank 
specialists. 
  Probably, however, all this will be insufficient. Therefore, 
we recommend that in cities, where there are higher and 
secondary specialized institutions, including former tekhnikums 
of the USSR State Bank and now schools of the Central Bank, you 
establish a course network and that you organize your own 
schools in big banks. A number of banks already have such 
schools and we are prepared to assist in their establishment. 
  The criminogenic situation is worsening in the country. 
According to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in 
1993 more than 110,000 crimes were uncovered in the economic 
sphere. This is one-fourth more than during the previous year. A 
significant number of violations have been uncovered in currency 
exchange centers. Counterfeiters have also become more active. 
This problem has reached the state level. 
  According to the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
last year more than 5,000 crimes were committed in financial and 
credit systems. More than 2,000 criminal cases concerning forged 
letters of advice and other monetary documents are being 
investigated now. During these years 20 bank workers were 
killed. In connection with N.P. Likhachev's murder at the call 
of the Association of Russian Banks banks held a protest action. 
  Taking into consideration the increase in the criminogenic 
situation, three times we addressed a request and a demand to RF 
President B.N. Yeltsin to take measures concerning bank safety. 
On his instruction the Ministry of Internal Affairs, jointly 
with the Association of Russian Banks and the Central Bank, 
worked out a special plan of measures connected with bank 
safety. However, banks themselves must increase vigilance and 
establish their own internal protection system. This is the 
world banking practice. The Executive Board of the Association 
of Russian Banks distributed a number of approved 
recommendations on this matter to all banks. 
  The criminalization of Russian entrepreneurial activity is 
largely connected with major problems in existing legislation. 
That is precisely why many bank clients and sometimes mere 
adventurists calmly conclude transactions, knowing in advance 
that they will not be able to fulfill their terms and that the 
law will not punish them for this. The rights of all 
participants in the economic turnover are poorly protected now. 
In this connection there is an acute need to revise the Civil 
Code, legislation on the regulation of the activity of 
joint-stock companies, and legislation protecting the rights of 
creditors and, primarily, banks. 
  However, the criminogenic situation has now picked up speed 
to such an extent that individual sectors of the market economy, 
including the banking system, are not able to cope with it. A 
special federal program on this problem and the use of the 
entire state power are needed. 
  We pay special attention to the legal protection of banks. 
In 
1993 the Legal Department of the Association of Russian Banks 
sent more than 400 written replies to commercial banks. The 
jurists of the Association of Russian Banks participated in the 
examination of a significant number of legal actions and helped 
banks to win them. For the purpose of a better orientation of 
bank jurists 79 consultations and councils were provided for 
them. The Legal Department, jointly with the Department for 
Personnel Training of the Association of Russian Banks, 
conducted several seminars of jurists of commercial banks, in 
which more than 500 people were retrained. 
  As you know, an arbitration tribunal was established under 
the Association of Russian Banks. Banks have begun to use its 
services quite actively. The activity of the arbitration 
tribunal is characterized by the following data: A total of 28 
pieces of material were sent to it, the total amount of demands 
for relief being 4,179.5 million rubles and 439,700 dollars. 
Four judgments were rendered and claims in the amount of 2,705.8 
million rubles out of 2,710.0 million demands for relief were 
satisfied. 
  The existing pension system of social insurance cannot 
ensure 
the standard of living that a person had when working in a bank. 
In connection with this the problem of creating in banks a 
mechanism of additional nonstate pension security becomes 
urgent. Today, however, about 150 nonstate pension funds 
function in various economic sectors. A number of banks 
(Inkombank, Menatep, Tori-Bank, and so forth) have also begun 
the formation of pension funds. For now, however, this process 
is slow. We recommend that banks examine this matter and we are 
prepared to coordinate their efforts for the establishment of 
the indicated pension funds. The RF President's Edict No 1077 
dated 16 September 1992 "On Nonstate Pension Funds" serves as 
the legal basis for this. However, for a stable operation of 
these funds an edict alone is obviously insufficient. Government 
decisions on developing a system of nonstate pension security 
and on granting tax privileges to funds are needed. Taking into 
consideration that in the very near future in nonstate pension 
funds tens of billions of rubles can be accumulated and used for 
investing, the funds themselves can become a powerful factor of 
stability both in the economy and in the social sphere. 
  The revival of Russian entrepreneurship is inseparably 
linked 
with the revival of noble traditions of charity in our country. 
Owing to the efforts and material support of various commercial 
structures, including banks, many spheres of public health, 
social security, science, and culture deprived of state 
financing continue to operate. Russia's banking system advanced 
further than other sectors of the market economy. Banks received 
the opportunity to carry out large-scale charitable actions and 
to help those that, owing to various reasons, were below the 
poverty line. This is not only our good deed, but our civic duty. 
  From the very beginning of its activity the association has 
actively supported all good initiatives by bankers. Good deeds 
by banks include assistance to the poor, sick, old, and orphans, 
many saved human lives, restored temples, and so forth. 
  We are grateful to our banker colleagues, who did not leave 
unanswered many recommendations and requests, which the 
Association of Russian Banks addressed directly to them, gave 
assistance to dozens of people, and supported several most 
interesting journals, which were on the verge of disappearance, 
and the restoration and decoration of temples. 
  Many banks support fine arts, helping artists and galleries. 
Some of them create their own collections. The Association of 
Russian Banks, especially in order to help banks, established an 
expert art council, which includes excellent specialists, and 
banks can ask the Association of Russian Banks for competent 
assistance in these matters. 
  Your charitable and sponsorship activity should not dry up. 
It points specifically to the participation of commercial banks 
in Russia's spiritual revival. 
  The First Congress of Banks, at which the Association of 
Russian Banks was established, was held 3 years ago. At that 
time 65 banks joined it. Today the Association of Russian Banks 
has 790 banks in its ranks, that is, it increased 12-fold. The 
combined authorized capital of banks--members of the Association 
of Russian Banks--makes up 52 percent of all the banks. Almost 
all big banks are members of the Association of Russian Banks. 
  However, there are still potentials for a closer 
consolidation of Russia's commercial banks and they should be 
utilized. 
  The protection and representation of the interests of banks, 
creation of a favorable atmosphere for growth and improvement, 
and active participation in the establishment and strengthening 
of Russia's new national banking system were the main directions 
in the work of the Council and the Executive Board of the 
Association of Russian Banks. Without false modesty it can be 
said that all of us managed to do a great deal. The Association 
of Russian Banks has become the headquarters of commercial 
banks, to which people turn with joy and sorrow and, the chief 
thing, for help. The fact that two foreign commercial banks 
operating according to Russian laws have joined it also points 
to the association's prestige. 
  The management of the Association of Russian Banks has been 
working for business connections with bodies of state 
administration and the solution of problems of the banking 
system through them. During that time meetings with RF President 
B.N. Yeltsin, several meetings with RF Government Chairman V.S. 
Chernomyrdin and his deputies, and regular meetings with V.V. 
Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia, his 
deputies, the management of tax inspectorates, the Ministry of 
Finance, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were held. Business 
relations with deputies of the State Duma and of the Federation 
Council, primarily with the Committee on the Budget, Taxes, 
Banks, and Finances, were established. As a rule, we find 
support everywhere. 
  The Council of the Association of Russian Banks consisting 
of 
27 people, which was elected at the First Founding Congress, 
worked actively and held its meetings on the dates determined by 
the Charter of the Association of Russian Banks. Fundamental 
problems concerning the activity of the banking system were 
discussed at meetings. During those years 17 meetings were held, 
at which 138 questions were discussed. According to the subjects 
they can be unified into the following three groups: 
  --improvement in banking legislation and coordination of 
bank 
activity--147 questions; 
  --representation and protection of bank interests in bodies 
of executive and legislative power--161 questions; 
  --social and organizational questions--74. 
  For immediate work on the fulfillment of decisions of 
congresses and of the council an executive board with a small 
staff--only 26 people--was established. The executive board 
carries out work on the fulfillment of decisions of congresses 
and of the council and conducts correspondence with bodies of 
state power, banks, courts, and so forth. In 1993 and during 3 
months of 1994 alone the board's total document turnover was 
about 2,000 letters. 
  What have the Council and the Executive Board of the 
Association of Russian Banks managed to do in the last 3 years? 
  1. To help the new banking system to become firmly 
established and to hold a firm place in the business world as 
the most organized, consolidated, and actively operating 
organization and to establish business contacts with the Central 
Bank, the government, the parliament, and the president. 
  2. To gain a firm position as an active protector of 
interests of commercial banks. To make the Association of 
Russian Banks the professional lobbyist body of commercial 
banks. The association tries to prevent the emergence of 
problems, which can do damage to the new banking system, from 
whomever they may originate, and actively comes out in the 
defense of commercial banks. It made a number of fundamental 
protests and statements, which explained the position of the 
Association of Banks and commercial banks in the economy and 
society. 
  3. To promote the introduction of advanced technologies and 
computer hardware into banking. 
  4. To create conditions for the training, retraining, and 
qualification apprenticeship of banking personnel both in the 
country and abroad. 
  5. To establish bodies for the protection of commercial 
interests of banks of the internal banking community, primarily 
the arbitration tribunal. 
  6. To provide banks with the necessary information, which is 
an important condition for their orientation in commercial 
activity, and to ensure the publication of the Information 
Bulletin. The first issue of a "thick" journal, BANK, will be 
published in the very near future and a banking encyclopedia is 
being prepared for publication. 
  7. To familiarize banks with world banking experience and 
with the application of world banking standards in their work 
and for this purpose to hold several international conferences 
on various aspects of banking, meetings, and negotiations with 
our foreign colleagues. 
  8. To represent the new banking system in the business world 
of various states, as well as in the World Bank, in the Economic 
Commission of the European Economic Community, and in the 
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. To establish 
business relations with banking associations, central banks, and 
commercial banks in the United States, England, Germany, 
Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, France, Australia, Japan, 
Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Finland, Ireland, and other countries, 
which promoted an improvement in the Russian banking system. 
  9. To expand the number and to improve the quality of 
services provided by the Association of Russian Banks to 
commercial banks. 
  10. To transform the Association of Russian Banks into a 
competent partner of the Central Bank, as is being done in all 
foreign countries, and to become an active participant in the 
establishment and improvement of Russia's new economic and 
banking system. 
  New times also raise more complex, new problems before the 
banking system and the Association of Russian Banks. It is 
necessary to enhance the association's role and status and to 
expand the sphere of its influence during the elaboration and 
examination of fundamental questions concerning the development 
of the economy and banking. In our opinion, it would be correct 
if the Association of Russian Banks had the right of legislative 
initiative and state bodies were obliged to examine, jointly 
with the Association of Russian Banks, fundamental plans for the 
development of the economy, credit and monetary policy, and so 
forth. 
  More and more regional banking associations and unions are 
now being established, including with the help of the 
Association of Russian Banks. This structure is very important 
for the solution of problems connected with the activity of 
commercial banks, which arise in localities, and, first of all, 
for contacts with local administrations. We have not yet found 
the optimum solution of the status of these organizations. Now 
they are organized as independent, administratively not subject 
to the Association of Russian Banks. On the one hand, this is 
good, because this does not tie them to any obligations. 
However, with such a situation there is a certain isolation from 
the general banking movement and, although we involve them in 
the elaboration of some problems, advise them of the work plans 
of the Association of Russian Banks, and invite them to meetings 
of councils of the Association of Russian Banks, probably, this 
is insufficient. Perhaps we should give thought to making them 
regional departments of the Association of Russian Banks without 
violating democracy or tying them within a strict administrative 
framework. 
  Dear colleagues! 
  I reported to you on the work done during these years. Very 
many problems lie ahead, which the new Council of the 
Association of Russian Banks and the entire banking community 
will have to solve. Basically, they are known to us, but many 
will appear anew. I would like to end my report on an optimistic 
note. Undoubtedly, we will advance, reform the economy and 
society, and gradually get out of the crisis. Russia has all the 
conditions for this.

<F P=106> [Article signed K.G.B.: "Intrigues as Politics. What the </F>
Kremlin Is Whispering About"] 
  [Text] There are three laws that define the "dogfight" 
under the Kremlin carpet. In the first place, it is constantly 
going on and never ceases even for a single hour. In the second 
place, this refined battle consists of a number of bilateral 
duels in which analytical notes, telephone calls, proximity to 
Banana's (the Kremlin nickname for Yeltsin) aides, etc. are 
used. Third, periodically they all gang up against one who is 
bothering many of them and at whom the finger of the "leader" 
(another nickname for the president) is pointed. 
  Yuriy Baturin, the president's aide for national security is 
persistently intriguing against Oleg Labov, the secretary of the 
Security Council. So successfully that a couple of weeks ago he 
forced him to hastily hide in the hospital. But Baturin (the 
Kremlin's nickname--Sour Cabbage Soup) and S. Filatov, who 
supports him, miscalculated and underestimated the traditions of 
the "Sverdlovsk grouping": The president and Labov communicated 
in a friendly way for a long time on the eve of the meeting of 
the Security Council last week. 
  Incidentally, at that same meeting of the Security Council 
the president blew up at A. Kozyrev. "There is no Russian policy 
regarding the Caucasus." And what about the other regions or 
problems--is there a policy for them? The foreign affairs 
minister turned pale. He had prepared to answer on the Yugoslav 
crisis and managed to warn his deputy, V. Churkin, that he would 
be the scapegoat. One can assume that of those present at the 
meeting of the Security Council, the newly appointed Deputy 
Prime Minister S. Shakhray would gloat the most. Because the 
conflict in the Northern Caucasus was largely on his conscience. 
  Incidentally, observers doing time and motion studies of the 
Kremlin intrigues are more and more frequently asking one 
another this question: When will Shakhray "deny" Prime Minister 
V. Chernomyrdin? 
  Recently S. Shakhray persuaded the prime minister to abandon 
the idea of creating his own party and proposed his own PRUA 
[Party of Russian Unity and Accord] "to rule and guide." S. 
Shakhray had turned the ministry entrusted to him into a PRUA 
staff headquarters. You cannot deny him the ability to speak 
intelligently and significantly in the provinces, supposedly on 
behalf of Yeltsin or Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, and get his own 
people elected as deputies in the localities. Recently he 
received another "trump card" from the prime minister: Credits 
for Northern deliveries will go through the PRUA. 
  But observers find that S. Shakhray is "too frisky." Does he 
want to turn the PRUA into the CPSU? But there is still the law 
on de-party-ization held in reserve. The necessary people also 
recall the strong hostility the deputy prime minister felt for 
Viktor Polyanichko, who was still alive at the time. And they 
also note S. Shakhray's desire to play on the disagreements 
between the president and the prime minister. Observers are 
inclined to think that eventually he will have to choose between 
the two gentlemen. 
  Ultimately, even Yu. Luzhkov--that successful member of the 
nomenklatura, steeled by swimming in ice holes on the coldest of 
days, recently read with terror in an official communication: 
"...acting mayor of the city of Moscow Yu. M. Luzhkov." 
  In the darkness of the political blind alley everyone tries 
to kick the "acting mayor" harder. "Why stick your neck out? Did 
you want to become president? Do you think that just because you 
have money you can be impudent! We will show you the presidency!" 
  Yu. Luzhkov was denied access to the president's physical 
presence. V. Chernomyrdin is confidently attacking "the acting 
mayor." First Deputy Prime Minister O. Soskovets, who also 
"placed his bets" both on the prime minister and on Yu. Luzhkov 
has begun to cautiously distance himself from the lover of the 
ice holes. And they continue to whisper to the president: Yu. 
Luzhkov and V. Pankratov, the chief of the Main Administration 
of Internal Affairs of Moscow, as before, are mourning the early 
demise of their close friend Otari Kvantrishvili. The president, 
they say, is downcast and taps his pencil on the desk. And in 
the Kremlin offices they are whispering: "Why does Luzhkov want 
to move several domestic troop divisions from Yerin's command to 
Pankratov's? To fight crime? Do not make me laugh, Ivan 
Ivanovich...indeed...", smiles are stretching from ear to ear, 
and even the excellent microphones cannot catch it. 
  Spring had a favorable effect on the president of the 
Strategy Fund, G. Burbulis. Under the influence of the rays of 
the sun Gennadiy Eduardovich again felt like a strategist and a 
fighter. According to rumors, he calls V. Chernomyrdin "Viktor 
Boozevich" and Ye. Gaydar, in his own words, he has "crossed off 
his list for good," and he wants somehow to make B. Fedorov, a 
member of the State Duma and former finance minister of the 
Russian Federation, the leader of the younger generation of 
"democrats." Who needs G. Burbulis today, observers ask 
themselves; and they answer--S. Filatov. 
  Under the influence of the warm spring weather ties between 
the radical democrat S. Filatov and the social democrat I. 
Rybkin have become closer. The speaker of the State Duma, for 
example, phones the leader of the president's administration: 
"OMON [Special Missions Militia Detachment] representatives are 
coming to us here at the Duma from various parts of the country 
and demanding that we adopt a law on the inadmissibility of 
using the OMON against the people." "But you have more important 
draft laws" comes the answer. "And that is right," answers the 
speaker. 
  ...Sun, warmth, spring. Last year's leaves and illusions are 
burning. Green grass and new intrigues are ripening.

<F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Dudko, clergyman of the Russian Orthodox </F>
Church, spiritual adviser for the newspaper DEN-ZAVTRA, Easter 
1994: "An Easter Message"] 
  [Text] This year the celebration of Easter coincides with 
the celebration of May 1st--the holiday of the Communists. Is 
this coincidence not an sign? 
  If you look at the hardships the true Christians and the 
true 
Communists are bearing in our time, you will say: Yes, there is 
some kind of sign, and right away you will add: and not just 
some kind. I think that the fate of the Communists and 
Christians are in some way the same. Although the majority of 
Communists in Soviet times declared their lack of faith, as the 
philosophers say, a lack of faith is the back door to faith. 
They are basically for the people, they care about their 
well-being, and they are self-sacrificing, their heroism being 
reminiscent of the Christian martyrs. Take just Anpilov, who 
stated outright that he is a natural Christian and can even 
forgive his enemies in spite of the fact that they are 
constantly tormenting him. Therefore, I would like to send an 
Easter greeting first of all to the orthodox Christians and 
Communists. 
  Christ is risen!--this means that our suffering will turn to 
joy! No, this has never happened on our earth, not to mention 
the fact that the physical collapse of the country will soon be 
complete and moral degradation is making an ever more stunning 
impression. From the screens of television sets and on the radio 
the people are being duped, lied to outright, and exposed to 
unconcealed cynicism and Satanism. It would seem that evil 
forces are triumphant. But it just seems that way; behind all 
this one must be able to see the triumph of Christianity. We 
must not live the way they are living and the way we are called 
to live! It illuminates Christian truths. Along with the poet 
you will say: The darker the night the brighter the stars. 
  Christ is risen!--and Hell has been destroyed, its locks are 
worn out, although some people are trying to reinforce them. 
Hell has been destroyed not only in eternity but also here and 
now, on earth. Listen to the beating of your heart: It beats 
harmoniously and confidently. Sheep and wolves do indeed feed 
together. Chekists who were previously threatening to us are now 
asking forgiveness from their victims. Even from me. I cannot 
forget the humble image of two Chekists who in the church where 
I serve got down on their knees before me and said: "Forgive 
us." I closed my eyes to all their offenses and said to the 
Chekists: And you forgive me for the fact that I once allowed 
myself to become bitter, willingly or not. 
  Orthodox Christians and Communists must walk in the front 
ranks to save Russia--help us God, Christ is risen. 
  But it is not just I who see that believers and Communists 
can speak the same language; soon all of us who populate Russia 
will start speaking in the same language--of courage, 
cheerfulness, and joy. 
  Easter is celebrated in Russia as it is in no other country. 
In the West they celebrate Christmas more and in a secular way; 
here even the so-called atheists back in Soviet times celebrated 
this holiday along with believers because Russia, like Christ 
himself, has always been on Golgotha awaiting its resurrection. 
  On which Golgotha or, rather, on which one of the Golgothas 
are we celebrating Christ's resurrection and, consequently, ours 
this year? The Golgotha with the name of Christ will not and 
cannot bear destruction, this exhaustion of creativity. Russia 
is exhausted in order to create because her creation is needed 
by more than just the Russian people. 
  Look at what America is doing, at the police-like fervor 
under the guise of reconciliation with which it inflames 
hostility. Russia, tempered by all kinds of troubles and 
misfortunes, having emerged from the crucible of all kinds of 
temptations, is necessary to everyone. Her loving heart which 
reconciles earthly passions is needed. Without her wise word, 
said Dostoevsky, there will be no harmony in the world. That 
would be a minor loss, but the disaster is that the world would 
believe the deception of the Antichrist and blindly follow him 
into the abyss. 
  Our Golgotha leads not to death but to resurrection!--it is 
with these encouraging words that I wish to address all readers 
of the newspaper DEN-ZAVTRA. Dear readers, you along with the 
newspaper workers have experienced both the bitterness and the 
joy, you have stood before the shameful court of law, and more 
than once. That will not be in vain. We will not gloat about our 
enemies and the fact that they have not always managed to 
realize their evil intentions. Thus we want to say to them: God 
be with you! 
  I also want to address my Easter message to workers and 
readers who are not Russian and not Christian. Who knows the 
human heart? Perhaps Christian truths are already beginning to 
take hold in your hearts. Therefore I do not think that the 
truths of love and resurrection are alien to you. And that being 
the case I say to you: Christ is risen! We all have the same 
God, there is no other God than the true God! Since for the 
present day we are involved in the newspaper together it means 
that we are proceeding together toward the true God, although in 
different ways. And that which unites and gladdens us--this is 
our common suffering. We shall always be brothers and rejoice in 
one another's success, especially the success of our 
long-suffering motherland in which we live together. 
  Nor would I want to forget those who are hostile to us. 
Hostility has blinded you and you yourselves cannot see what you 
are doing. Some day you will shed bitter tears: After all, many 
of you are our blood brothers, but we are going against one 
another as aliens. 
  God grant us that, having looked from our Golgotha of 1994 
we 
have seen the crucified and resurrected Christ and, along with 
him, the crucified and resurrected Russia. All is forgiven with 
resurrection, as it is said in the Easter Psalm, embracing one 
another we shall cry out: Christ is risen from the dead, defying 
death with death, giving life to the entombed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Anpilov by Aleksandr Prokhanov; place </F>
and date not given: "`We Shall Not Submit!' Dialogue Between 
Aleksandr Prokhanov and Viktor Anpilov"] 
  [Text] [Prokhanov] Assessing today's real members of the 
opposition, politicians, and chiefs, one of our comrade men of 
letters called you the Russian Che Guevara. Because, most 
likely, your political behavior, your revolutionary romanticism, 
your self-sacrifice, predilection for demonstrations and 
marches, and orientation toward the elemental force of the human 
masses make you close in mentality, in practice, and even in 
fate, perhaps, to the revolutionaries of the 1960's, who were 
extolled by Marcuse and Sartre when they spoke about the inner, 
existential state of the soul of a people hurling them against 
the system and breaking down the most brutal barriers of this 
system. 
  I partially agree with this assessment of your personality. 
None of today's leaders, perhaps, has so earned through 
suffering the right to engage in politics as you. Your ideas, 
your popularity, and your loudspeaker appeals and speeches at 
demonstrations have been paid for by beatings and attended by 
violence and the fearful risk to which you have always subjected 
yourself. You have been beaten up after demonstrations on 
several occasions, on last year's tragic May Day holiday you 
were seized and tortured in a dungeon, and on 6 October you fell 
into the clutches of the secret police and were put in jail.... 
That is, all that you preach is not simply ideology, not simply 
a cri de coeur; it is, perhaps, a tortured fate. 
  I would like first to ask you to recount a few details of 
the 
May Day events--how it all happened, what you went through, what 
you felt there, and then your prison torments in Lefortovo. 
Readers know little of the details. They see a face and hear 
statements, but the details and actual particulars of what 
happens often elude them. 
  [Anpilov] All generalizations always suffer from 
superficiality somewhat. Yes, there are loudspeakers, an 
elemental force, demonstrations, but, in my view, this is only 
part of the truth, as is also the fact that I really do respect 
Ernesto Che Guevara. Not because I have been to Latin America or 
was fascinated, say, by Che Guevara's diary written in Bolivia, 
but simply because he was a remarkable, most honest individual. 
  I once visited in Havana a carbon black factory. On its 
grounds everyone, on account of its production process, was 
immediately changed from a white into a black because there was 
soot everywhere. Che Guevara had been dead for 15 years, but the 
workers of this factory still remembered that, considering the 
importance of this small enterprise for tire production, he 
would come here without fail once a quarter to put in an unpaid 
day's work. He worked together with everyone, unloading this 
carbon black. Che Guevara worked both in ships' holds and 
elsewhere. As minister of industry of Cuba and also president of 
the national bank, he still found time to work shoulder to 
shoulder with the ordinary people and to meet with them. There 
is for me something sacred in this: He did not become detached 
from the people, he was a part of them. 
  When I am compared to Che Guevara or some other figures, 
therefore, I permit myself to observe that I am first and 
foremost part of the people, I am a grain of their sand. And I 
cannot fail to express the cherished aspirations that are now 
arising at the very heart of my people. It is like this because 
I was born in an ordinary peasant family, and this was, if you 
like, the most treasured and purest aspect of my life. I was not 
only raised by my mama and father, who came back from the war 
missing an arm, an invalid, and whom, as soon as he was back on 
his feet, we all helped. He fired ceramics, pots, as we say. I 
had another education also. I remember many of our neighbors, I 
remember Mariya Stepanovna, an old woman, who said: "Do not pull 
down the green pears when they are ripening; I will give you 
them myself." And she would bring ripe and appetizing ones.... 
  I do not mean to say that I was raised by the people. But I 
have always felt myself to be a part of them and have imbibed 
the best that there is in humanity. This means Che Guevara and 
Copernicus, if you like, and Garcia Marquez and the all the 
immense possessions bequeathed by universal experience that our 
people have accumulated. All this can never be personified by 
just one personality, even an outstanding one; the people are 
always more important. 
  At some stages of history, the people push forward from 
among 
themselves persons expressing their aspirations, and I am happy 
that this has, possibly, been the case with me. But I repeat: 
Without that universal concept of goodness which our people has 
accumulated, Viktor Anpilov is impossible, please consider this. 
I myself am by no means an elemental force; no, this is a 
deep-seated thing, and there is behind each demonstration 
organization and hard painstaking work. But I am a part of a 
popular elemental force, whence the hatred of me to a large 
extent. Because were it possible to buy the people, say, they 
would have bought Anpilov also. Were it possible to intimidate 
them, they would have intimidated Anpilov too.... 
  We were acquainted with the violence of which you speak back 
in December 1991, when we gathered at the Spasskaya Tower, 
demanding the release of Parfenov. On an order from Dovzhuk, I 
was seized before the people's eyes by a Special Militia squad. 
I realized then for the first time that the system was changing, 
that everything customary and Soviet was changing. I was thrown 
to the floor of the bus, and hefty types piled in on top and 
jumped on me and worked me over. As a police backside crushed my 
chest, there occurred to me the comparison that it was this that 
was the society with "values common to all mankind," as they 
say, toward which I was being pulled by Gorbachev, Yeltsin, 
Margaret Thatcher, Reagan, and Kohl--no end of them. It was 
THEIR society, and I do not want such a society!... 
  Everything proves that the Moscow authorities, and not only 
they, violated on May Day a number of laws and the Constitution, 
primarily the freedom of street marches and demonstrations. In 
addition, the actions of the authorities were from the very 
outset of a provocative nature.... 
  Luzhkov delayed a response to our notice of a street 
procession. We should have been given an answer within five 
days' time, and not a refusal even, possibly, but an offer to us 
of another route.... But he gave it only on 29 April in the 
afternoon, when just one day remained until May Day. We appealed 
immediately to the Supreme Soviet, calling this a provocation. 
It was aimed, following the referendum in April, allegedly a 
"victory" for Yeltsin, at wiping out the opposition. 
  My entire line of conduct was structured with regard to this 
danger. When I said: "We are leaving the center!" many people 
shouted at me: "Anpilov is a stoolie, we are not leaving, we are 
going to the center!" People had to be persuaded; we had to 
encourage them to leave. We left, but we were overtaken, because 
they needed blood. They were thirsting for this blood!... 
  And after May Day came 9 May, and after such events, the 
people objectively had to take to the streets. And, to provoke 
unrest, Anpilov had to be snatched at that time. I thought a 
great deal about this incident in Lefortovo, and it was more 
frightening there, of course, because you are expecting to die 
at any moment. You have been blindfolded, you are helpless, and 
your hands have been cuffed behind your back. There is nothing 
worse for a man than the sense of his insignificance and 
impotence. You cannot resist, it is useless to shout 
anything--you have a gag in your mouth. And what is there to 
shout? The last things--the scents of the forest, my Russian 
forest--when I was dragged from the Rafik vehicle, were 
particularly heart-wrenching, perhaps. I was suddenly assailed 
by the thought that I was breathing this air for the last time. 
  Unfortunately, our society is moving toward such methods. 
And 
this is borne out once again by what happened on 3 October.... I 
was arrested on 7 October. I had contemplated our making our way 
toward a center of Working Russia in the heart of the country, 
where it was operating the most strongly. But I would have had 
for this to have altered my appearance, if only somewhat. I 
thought, well, my beard will grow a little, perhaps, and I could 
alter my ID somewhat in order to have shifted my base to the 
Rostov-na-Donu area, to Shakhty. I had a long-standing 
invitation from the miners. But I was not in time.... 
  I was in Tula recently, after my release. I was given a 
magnificent greeting. None of our people betrayed me, not one. 
All kinds of rumors were going around there.... Neither the 
owners of the dacha--ordinary Russian people--nor others in the 
community said anything. 
  I did, indeed, hide out at the dacha. I was lying down and 
resting on the second floor, and suddenly I heard the noise of a 
powerful engine. I looked out the window; right outside stood an 
armored transport vehicle, from which soldiers were jumping 
down. I had no weapon. Should I run? They would kill me as I 
tried to flee--and that would be that. I climbed into the loft 
and hid there. For a long time they could not find me, until a 
lieutenant colonel of the interior forces, I don't know his 
name, guessed. I did not for a long time tell anyone that he had 
struck me once when I was handcuffed. But I was told in Tula 
that he himself had bragged of this: "I gave Anpilov a good 
whack!" Well, may the Lord be his judge. I did not speak about 
this, I did not want to put the man to shame for having hit me. 
  They searched for two hours. They surrounded the entire 
community and posted men with assault rifles everywhere. These 
were the actions of members of punitive detachments, this, most 
likely, was how they caught the partisans. They said: Any 
suspicious vehicle--open fire. What does suspicious mean? It 
could have been a person who had nothing to do either with Reds 
or Whites or Yeltsin or Stalin. But this was the order--I heard 
it distinctly. They had set up radio communications right in 
this dacha, on the second floor, and I heard everything from the 
loft. 
  And then the lieutenant colonel, he was tall and fit, rapped 
with his fist on the ceiling, and the empty dishes--jars--began 
to rattle, and, as usual in a dacha, he realized that there was 
some space up above. They began to search. I would like to 
mention one person taking part in this search. We met eye to 
eye. He said nothing. It is hard to convey this: My mouth was 
completely dry, my whole body was tense because I realized full 
well that an order to do away with me could be given. This was a 
very convenient occasion for killing "while attempting to flee," 
but this man said nothing and subsequently said nothing 
throughout this whole trial. I realized that there are still 
honest people even in their ranks. 
  The lieutenant colonel, unfortunately, found the entrance, 
and there was a light switch there. When the light was switched 
on, I said: "I'm here, I am unarmed." They shouted: "Come out!" 
They were overjoyed to have found me. It was when the handcuffs 
had been put on that he struck me. In order, perhaps, to lift 
some guilt from his heart, perhaps he felt uncomfortable and, in 
order to suppress this pang of conscience, he was forced to lash 
out. 
  Then the television cameras, I know how they, these rogues, 
try to operate. They immediately trained the lens on my worker's 
boots, which had come from the dacha, unattractive, rough--the 
owner's working boots. The owner, apparently, had put on my good 
boots and said: "Anpilov has just left. I will show you the 
direction. He wanted to divert them from the dacha and went out 
in my boots. For a long time I could not understand where my 
boots were and had to put these on. The camera immediately 
focused attention on these boots: There is Anpilov for 
you--homeless, not a real man. 
  I was escorted under armed guard to Tula, then to Moscow. I 
was taken to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Yerin's 
first deputy came out and looked me over: "Ah, Anpilov! Let him 
live, for the time being." I realized that the big guy was not 
joking. "For the time being"--this was a long time: just an 
hour, I would be of use to the people. I did not get into a 
fight with him: I was in handcuffs, he was at liberty. 
  I was taken to Lefortovo, accompanied by about 20 masked 
sharpshooters, what is more. Perhaps they were for deterrence 
purposes, but it was even ridiculous to me at that time, a kind 
of comedy. 
  The first day in prison was psychologically very difficult; 
each sound, each rustle would put the nerves in a state of 
numbness. But three days later I was transferred to a cell with 
another person. I had, understandably, to display caution, but 
we found a common language, nonetheless. He was a KGB officer 
who had been charged with having divulged a state secret, and he 
talked about suicide the whole time. 
  I did not consider it my duty to dissuade him or to impress 
upon him that he should live, but it is possible that I managed 
to somehow influence him by my behavior. Each day I did morning 
exercises, went on the outside walk, and learned by heart poems 
of Lorca and Marti and some pages of Jack London's "Call of the 
Wild." This is an old way of mine of keeping the mind busy. And 
then I became used to it and began to write, and the warders 
were now, I believe, giving me paper with pleasure. 
  Prison has its own little peculiarities, and it is only 
there 
that you sense them. If someone asks: "Give me some paper," they 
are required to provide it, but they immediately ask: "How many 
sheets, three, four, five?" No more. When I asked, however, they 
would give me 15, 20 sheets--this was a luxury. 
  My treatment in prison was proper, although my solitary was 
tough. But at the same time I believe that Solzhenitsyn and many 
others maliciously slandered the system of camps and prisons 
that existed in the USSR. Professionals work there. They are 
doing their duty, carrying out their official instructions. But 
not once did I have the feeling that there was a desire to 
humiliate me. Moreover, when we could not get something from the 
warders, sometimes the water in the shower was boiling, 
sometimes there was only cold water, for example, they were 
upset and would try to fix everything as quickly as possible. 
There are, then, small human pleasures, and they tried to ensure 
that the prisoners have these also. On the whole, they were, of 
course, jailers. Nonetheless, I stress once again: I agree with 
this treatment in the sense that the law is the law, nor should 
I have anything more, let me live and exist within the framework 
that is enshrined in law, so that neither you nor I violate it. 
  [Prokhanov] I did much thinking after those events--galling, 
bloody, frightening. I did not suffer your fate, thank God, 
although I also had to go into hiding for the first three days: 
I and my friends from the newspaper were forced to leave Moscow. 
We lived in the woods, and this also was a flight into the fall 
forests away from these appalling pogroms, from the blood, the 
roundups.... I saw on television in a peasant's hut how you were 
taken. 
  And this is what I was thinking with bitterness at that 
time: 
You are a politician, you are the leader of a party, of a 
popular movement, not only a Moscow, but Russian movement. The 
main thing in a movement is organization, but neither you nor we 
had a clandestine structure or reserves for a catastrophe 
situation. There were no secret addresses, no regime for a 
switch to underground activity, despite the fact that your party 
is in its practice, in its ideology, in its type of leaders the 
most radical, and it condemns itself to counterstrikes, to 
persecution, to terror on the part of these ruthless 
authorities. And I thought about this without any censure of 
you, because the Communists, whom you represent, had, truly, 
been kicked out into this post-communist, liberal, capitalist 
period by their recent party comrades themselves, by the party 
riff-raff, as you sometimes say. They kicked out not only the 
Communists, but the whole nation, the whole people. 
  I continue to ask myself in conversations with Emergency 
Committee people, with members of the last Soviet Government, 
with representatives of the former Soviet elite: How did a 
superpower, how did a very great communist empire, how did the 
second, perhaps even the first, economy of the world, how did 
this entire great organizational project fall to pieces so 
easily and so ineptly? Why did this organization, the greatest 
in the world, the Soviet Union, not have immune systems? Why did 
the party not have party political intelligence? 
  Back in the prewar period, even Stalin installed an 
underground organization on the territories that could have been 
occupied by the enemy and thought about the fact that it would 
be necessary, in the event of a fascist assault, to rebase the 
economy beyond the Urals, in Siberia. In recent decades the 
country essentially lived with a premonition of a third world 
war--weapons systems were prepared, plans for an offensive in 
the European theater were developed, there was a struggle of 
intelligence agencies, civil defenses were created.... Why did 
the party not make provision for forms of transition to an 
underground existence? Thought could have been given to this in 
the Gorbachev period, when it had become obvious that the party 
was being killed off, the state was being killed off. 
  Why were you, who spent two years forming a movement, unable 
to install secret underground structures within it? How do you 
explain this? 
  [Anpilov] First, I would mention that we are not political 
masochists. We do not want the authorities to be continually 
hounding us. Yes, truly, the Russian Communist Workers Party, 
which I represent, and the Working Russia movement are under 
daily, furious assault. And not only from the regime; fellow 
travelers sometimes prevent us from developing at full power. 
Attempts are continually being made to humiliate us and to make 
of us some insignificant, passing phenomenon, I would say, of 
Russian reality. 
  Yes, we have realized that we should prepare for underground 
work in earnest. But skills do not come without experience, 
without bitter experience, when, for example, your own life 
hangs by a thread. And what is most important here, what is 
more, is not to expose the lives of others, but one's own--this 
is a secondary consideration. 
  My main mistake, when I went to the dacha near Tula, was 
that 
I considered this land my land. The sun was shining, it was a 
beautiful fall, in which Lev Tolstoy exulted in these places. I 
went for walks, sawed wood.... The hell of it is that when an 
enemy has come to us openly, we have immediately understood 
this, but on this occasion we are harvesting the fruit of such 
quiet hidden work of global forces, not just Russian. 
  Just think, seven years have elapsed since Gorbachev's April 
Plenum of 1987, but can we say that there is no struggle? On the 
contrary, the intelligentsia is now rising up. Here is a letter 
I received: "Viktor Ivanovich, I can do everything--edit, print, 
I can talk to people, I am prepared to stand at the factory 
gate." Ah, so he has matured. So life itself and our struggle 
have given him a shove. 
  Our mission, overriding mission, rather, and my personal 
mission is to prevent this spirit of indomitability from 
perishing. To prevent the dying of hope, when all, seemingly, is 
over, when television and radio are antipopular, when the United 
States supports the regime, Germany, Japan.... Thatcher was 
overjoyed: What they had been dreaming of came to pass.... 
  We have discharged our function merely in the fact that we 
have not allowed the love of freedom of the people, the Russian 
people, as the pivot of the state, of the Soviet Union, to 
perish and have kept the hope of millions of people alive. I 
have just been in Novosibirsk, in Tula. In Novosibirsk--a packed 
hall, nowhere for an apple to fall, people give me a standing 
ovation. Why is this not shown on television? They are simply 
afraid that millions awaiting this would see this joy: For many 
are, after all, living as if in a dungeon. 
  [Prokhanov] The newspaper DEN and now ZAVTRA, which friends 
and enemies accuse of a certain eclecticism, has always had as 
its mission the unification of patriots, understanding here that 
with the spread of ideologies and political formulas and the 
wide spectrum of leaders we are condemning ourselves to 
eclecticism and a certain confusion. Although the idea of the 
combination of the scattered national field and the severed 
ideological body is in itself so far-reaching and important that 
all imperfections connected with this mission may be disregarded. 
  And we succeeded to some extent in the pre-October period in 
doing what was practically unprecedented. We succeeded, with 
reservations, in creating a formula of the combination of left 
and right patriots and Red and White statists and in persuading 
them for a while to halt the polemics, destructive for the 
opposition, devise the rules of a collective game, and impose a 
taboo on the desecration of objects of worship. There thus took 
shape a certain field of resistance, which was manifested so 
intensively in September-October, when anarchists and 
communists, atheists and clerics, radical nationalists and 
internationalists were on the same side of the barricades.... 
Misfortune and love brought us all together at that time in the 
White House. 
  Explain to me why, with the combination of red and white 
material, the red material has, nonetheless, been unable to 
unite in itself? Why do I, not being a communist, perceive as 
tragic these mutations in the communist milieu? 
  [Anpilov] Let us speak plainly. We could have made progress 
in the cohesion of the opposition while at least honesty was for 
us an immutable principle. But what is honesty? Everyone 
interprets it in his own way. Although we know precisely when we 
are behaving dishonestly. 
  When we say that there is no unity among the Reds, I recall 
the first demonstration under the leadership of Working Russia 
and the Russian Communist Workers Party in Moscow. It took place 
on 7 November 1991, when many people were literally in a state 
of shock from August. No one believed in the former leaders, and 
it was being said of some people at that time: "There is a 
national leader." I grabbed one by the arm on this long march 
from Marx Avenue to Red Square: "Go to the people, we are so 
much in need of a leader, go to the old people who are standing 
around the Lenin Museum, say that you are here, that you, damn 
it, are alive!" "No, my time has not come," I was told. "I am 
for later." But they were needed immediately. I did not lay 
claim to the role of leader, but if the people themselves push 
you forward, you cannot betray them or renounce the principles 
thanks to which the people put their faith in you. 
  We brought out no fewer than 150,000 people at one time on 7 
November. Remember that slush--we were forced to walk through 
these vile pools by the mayor, it was still Popov. There was not 
a single instance of anyone going too far. We walked on, 
inwardly incensed at not having been given elbow-room, whereas 
the democrats had been given Lubyanka and Marx Avenue, although 
they amounted to altogether nothing. 
  But then came May Day, and everyone saw that, apparently, 
the 
people could get up off their knees themselves and put forward 
their own leaders. That they could manage without the recognized 
leaders, who held the levers of power. And here the mortal 
struggle for the masses began. They came to be pulled apart and 
split on various pretexts, rumors were circulated: He is such 
and such. 
  I shall tell you an innermost thought: On account of a fear 
of losing, seemingly, a large detachment of supporters, I, 
Anpilov, having no experience, allowed the masses that we had 
immediately begun to lead after August 1991 to be pulled apart 
under various flags and led in different directions. And the 
more we shouted about unity, the more sparsely attended our 
meetings became. The time came when I said: Ideological 
omnivorousness will do nothing; it is better to define our 
principles more precisely, and then it will be easier to agree 
to an alliance with whomever we like. 
  What, in fact, do we want? Here I approach the key problem. 
I 
consider Red those who advocate a cardinal solution of two 
questions. The first is the power of the working people. The 
political power of the people formula is a fraud. The power of 
the working people, on the other hand, is a strict formula. 
Decoded, it means that we need to strive for a situation where 
the worker, from the engineer through the lathe hand, has an 
interest in the results of his labor and not genuflect either 
before the secretary of the party committee or before the 
director of the plant or before the trade union boss to obtain 
an apartment, a place in a kindergarten, or a pass to a 
sanatorium. It is he who should distribute everything, via his 
elective bodies, including the hiring of management and the 
determination of its pay--this is what is meant by power of the 
working people. 
  This is the very essence of the interests of our people. 
They 
supported Yeltsin, after all, because they thirsted for justice, 
they were sick and tired of putting up with the double standard. 
People would shout about socialist morals and would themselves 
be basking in luxury with these underground banquets, young 
women.... It was a corrupt party, and to tolerate it was to 
become a traitor oneself. And if we want Reds, this means, if 
you will excuse me, being so kind as not to walk away from the 
dictatorship of the working man. The question of power is 
fundamental. 
  The next is property. An excellent combination of the 
individual and the public was found under Stalin. There were 
handicraftsmen, and the workshops paid taxes. Heavens, for every 
Russian individual who can do something I would, you can be 
sure, ensure these conditions. 
  The dual form, on the other hand, multi-structural, as they 
say, is a fraud also. There is no coexistence between them. The 
private rapaciously swallows up the public. Once again the 
people are being urged: Never mind, this is normal. No, it is a 
fraud, I do not want it! And everyone can see these absolutely 
predatory endeavors, which are being supported from overseas. 
They have an interest, after all, in the predator feeling 
himself to be a little princeling, be it in Buryatia, in Komi, 
or wherever you like. They will buy such a princeling, the main 
thing being that they have the money. 
  The Private Property Act, the reforms.... What do these 
mean? 
Gennadiy Andreyevich Zyuganov says: "I also am for the reforms." 
I am categorically opposed! What reforms? I am for man having a 
better life. But they have hidden behind the word "reforms," 
Gorbachev and Yeltsin, and carried through a change of 
social and political system! Forgive me, they acted against 
the Constitution. What "reforms" are there here? And what kind 
of "reformers" are they? An entirely different word fits such 
activity; in my opinion, it is enshrined in the Criminal Code. 
  Give me an opportunity to say openly who I am. This is today 
both my tragedy and the tragedy of the Red movement. We have 
been cut off from people both by those who control television 
and the big press, and, unfortunately, the few tiny tots of 
information that remain on the other side, it would seem. The 
DEN-ZAVTRA newspaper has adopted the correct position, 
therefore. Let there be eclecticism, I agree.... 
  Artificial unity would burst at the seams at the first 
contact with reality. This was the case in the September-October 
days, say. The people came, but there was no strong political 
leadership, no strong idea. The tricolor Yeltsin flag fluttered 
there, at the House of Soviets. And however we begged that it be 
replaced by the red flag, it was not. And there was a tricolor 
flag in the office of Acting President Rutskoy also. He said 
that we should not annoy the democrats supporting legality. But 
it should have been remembered also that people are dying 
beneath this flag. Is this flag not a monstrous insult to those 
who died, defending the law? Both armored transport vehicles and 
the tanks carried a tricolor flag also.... We should be 
clutching just one. 
  [Prokhanov] You know that I am an apologist for the Soviet 
Union, the Soviet superpower, an apologist for Soviet military 
power, our super-industry, and huge organizational projects, 
which were possible only under the socialist management of the 
economy. Only socialism could have mastered the northern sea 
route and have created the industrial center in Siberia and 
space-based defenses. But I know that despite the colossal 
organizational building of the 1930's and the postwar boom, when 
we vanquished the strongest and most evil enemy of all mankind, 
we lost the battle for the peace, for the social ideal. 
  Listening to you say that the Reds mean dictatorship of the 
worker, I have to ask: So you come to power--I want you to come 
to power--what kind of revolutionary project would you be 
undertaking in this divided, shattered, worn-out society, which 
has gone through all the phases of socialist building? 
  [Anpilov] We did not lose the peace. There has been, is now, 
and always will be struggle for world domination. The question 
is who will control mankind, this planet: a handful of rogues, 
some country, a chosen people inappropriate for the "mankind" 
concept, or will Planet Earth live according to the laws of 
universal reason and simultaneously in the interests of 
man-the-toiler, who plows or invents. This is the whole cursed 
question. 
  I am for the second version, naturally. I believe that it is 
these two trends that condition modern development. And you will 
not escape this. But it would be wrong to say that the idea of a 
just society, a truly humane society, if you will, has been 
defeated. 
  Struggle is under way, and everyone knows for what he is 
fighting. There is people's fraternity, and there is 
self-interest and an endeavor to exploit others and oneself 
burst from being overfull. There are no other ideas in the 
world. We have not lost, therefore. I by no means consider that 
I have been brought to my knees; I will fight. 
  You ask what we would do were we to come to power. We have 
not done so yet, but even today I am attempting to hook up with 
Yuriy Maksimovich Slobodkin and present a brief, perhaps, but 
comprehensible bill charting clear, specific ways of ensuring 
the self-management of the workforce, be it of a research 
institute, kindergarten, plant, or shop. I received a call from 
Tver, and, according to the election results, precisely 51 
percent there are our people--Reds. So let us offer a basis 
uniting to some extent both the legislators of the Duma and the 
representative authority of the oblasts, cities, and rayons. 
  Were I personally to come to power, as president, say, I 
would abolish the very office of president, the presidency in 
Russia generally. It is getting in our way, it is alien to us. 
And this decree should clear the way for a revival of the power 
of the working people. 
  For such to be accomplished, the broadest movement of the 
masses is essential. I consider the most important task, 
therefore, that of raising the people, the working people, to 
the struggle for their vital rights. But I am not relinquishing 
the struggle at the top also. The field of struggle is enormous, 
and it may be conducted in each sector. And alliances can and 
should be concluded in each sector. But let us conclude them 
openly and honestly, that is, people must know what I have given 
up and what we will get in return. 
  We begin to support someone, say--we withdraw our own 
candidacy and we defend yours. But what will we get in this 
case? We cannot be continually bringing up the rear and begging 
alms from the victor. I remember the exclamations of the power 
ministers in the House of Soviets: "Where are Anpilov's people?" 
"Where is he with his people?" I did not consider all the people 
there mine, no, there were various people there. But this "Where 
is he?" was in the air. But since they were asking: "Where are 
the people?" allow me also some dignity, because I shall not 
otherwise deserve the trust of the people who follow me. 
  We have reached a point in the Red movement at which I do 
not 
have the moral right to enter into Tsipko's alliance. Everyone 
is free to choose for himself a class and goal, defend this 
class, and strive for this goal. I have not heard from Tsipko 
any statements contradicting the system of views that he 
defended in pushing through Gorbachev's reforms, demeaning my 
people and spitting in their face. I am a Christian by origin 
and am prepared to forgive. But, excuse me, are you ready to 
repent? You continually called on us to repent, you said the 
whole time that that was not where the temple was, go in the 
other direction. You shouted the whole time: "Repent!" Abuladze 
shouted: "Repent!" As far as removing his father from his grave 
and throwing him onto the garbage heap. This is what was foisted 
on us. I have no wish to unearth my father. More, I am prepared 
to fight for this grave, even if they kill me, tear me to 
pieces. There are sacred things, and stepping over them is more 
than I can do. It would be better to quit politics. 
  [Prokhanov] Our newspaper was, as you know, illegally and 
abominably closed down by Yeltsin, closed down by Luzhkov, 
because DEN was smashed up by Luzhkov's gang--30 men armed with 
assault rifles burst into our offices in camouflage, looted, 
burned, and desecrated our premises, rummaged around in my 
papers, dragged in a television camera and shot our world, our 
iconostasis, our emblems, our tattered flags. This whole gang 
came with a warrant signed by Luzhkov. The mayor had organized 
the pogrom against the newspaper. 
  And here we are once again being pulled into strife. Once 
again the mayor wants to wipe us out. Luzhkov has brought suit 
against the newspaper ZAVTRA. We said in one of our articles 
that he, Luzhkov, was responsible for the bloody events of May 
Day and 23 February. He latched onto these words and termed them 
insulting, although we all know that the mayor was responsible 
for the entire carnage wrought against us on 3-4 October also. 
Now we are faced with a lawsuit. 
  Luzhkov is now one of the most sullen and, for me, most 
dangerous and repulsive figures that have arisen on this burned 
ground called the motherland. He is moving toward brutal, 
ruthless, and bloody power, and competing with him is 
extraordinarily risky. I do not rule out the windows of my 
office being shelled by grenade launchers and our staff and 
correspondents being abducted, as you were abducted in May, I do 
not rule the entire might of the venal Luzhkov jurisprudence 
being heaped on us or our small office fighting against his 
billions. But we have accepted the fight and we will do battle 
with Luzhkov in the name of the people and hurl at him the 
accusation that he is not only responsible for the bloody events 
in May and February, he is responsible for the tragedy of 
Moscow, for the tragedy of Russia.... 
  [Anpilov] I take this opportunity to declare that I will 
call 
on my supporters to take part in the public proceedings. I hope 
that I can appear on your side as a witness. 
  Your newspaper once carried splendid material--the 
interrogation of Pankratov by the examining official Chuglazov. 
You only have to read it, and it all becomes clear. He says: 
Wherever Anpilov appears, there is unrest. This is all lies. 
Whatever obstacles have been put in our way, we have always 
found a common language with the regular militia officer, not 
only with the private and the sergeant, but with officers--the 
major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel--also. I can confirm this 
too. But Pankratov admitted, and attention needs to be called to 
this at the trial, that they had begun IN ADVANCE to practice 
operations for bringing enormous masses of armed people onto the 
streets of Moscow. To what end? And by what right? Who gave them 
this right? One is immediately drawn into a provocation. We have 
yet to threaten anyone, but you, with dogs, mounted officers, 
armed officers, posted these monsters--vehicles with concrete 
panels. We were threatened by force in advance. This was in 
itself a violation of human rights. International conventions, 
ratified under Yeltsin, proclaim that the administration is 
required to adopt all measures to prevent violence. But they, 
precisely the other way about, adopted all measures to ensure 
that violence did occur. This is their principal guilt. It was a 
deliberate use of violence against a peaceful demonstration. 
  The trial of the newspaper DEN is of enormous significance, 
also, because another provocation is brewing. They are once 
again inflaming tension in society. Some troop movement at 
Paveletskiy Station.... All this is being done to once again 
stage a bloody carnage on May Day. They want this. But our 
people will take to the streets just the same. 
  Luzhkov recently declared that he had purchased water cannon 
abroad and chemical agents for the noncontact dispersal of 
demonstrations. Once again the same thing! Have we already done 
something, or has Anpilov declared that he will go to Luzhkov's 
house or to his dacha to drag out his young wife by her hair? 
No, this is absurd. I am not a fascist, and if we go to this 
dacha, it will only be within the framework of the law. 
  But this is a national holiday! You have not canceled this 
holiday, the holiday of the working people! I know that Greek 
trade unions have sent our government a demand that we be 
allowed to march through the streets of Moscow unhindered. We 
want nothing more. We want to march in a demonstration, we want 
to set up a stage to sing our songs, the songs that we love. Why 
must you put obstacles in the way? 
  I have always said and will tell Luzhkov in court that if 
all 
militia officers are on this day of the working people's holiday 
cleared from the streets of Moscow, this will be the calmest day 
in Muscovites' lives. Let the militia go catch thieves and 
criminals, let them guard apartments.... 
  [Prokhanov] Tell me, Viktor Ivanovich, in prison, when there 
was this involuntary stillness and almost total solitude, or at 
night in your dreams, or at other moments has there, perhaps, 
come an instant of quietude, when your lonely, mortal, 
essentially defenseless soul, which at the start of the 
interview you called a grain of sand, reaches out after God, 
reaches out after the wonder, the mystery, the enigma? Have 
there been in your life states in which through all these 
barricades, loudspeakers, prisons, and beatings, some other, 
crystal, structure of the world has been revealed? 
  [Anpilov] It is revealed by the hour. Only I view these 
things not as romantically as you, perhaps, I do not, perhaps, 
give them the names that you give them. Yesterday I visited 
together with an Italian trade union delegation in drizzling 
rain--as though the skies were weeping--the places where our 
comrades fell. We told them how our brothers had been slain at 
the barricades around the House of Soviets. And then I took them 
to the Ukraina Hotel. We were all frozen and decided to have a 
coffee. The cafeteria assistant recognized me and said: "I will 
now make you the strongest, best coffee." And she then gave me 
back my money and treated us to some pastries in addition. I was 
happy at this moment. 
  Call this what you will, call it communion with God, but 
there was for me everything in this instant--the golden forest, 
the clear glade.... And I have very many such moments. This is 
people's recognition, and I consider that there is nothing in 
life, strictly speaking, higher than this....

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pospelova: "The Shoots of Zemstvo"] </F>
  [Text] The current Russian Zemstvo Movement is only 
half a year old. The recently held 2nd Congress of the RZM 
[Russian Zemstvo Movement] adopted movement's program, which 
will become its guideline for action for the next few years. 
  Civil peace will not happen by itself or by edict. It will 
have to be patiently constructed out of different building 
blocks: Mutual understanding, kindness, the desire to meet each 
other halfway, and many, many other things. The Russian Zemstvo 
Movement may also become such a building block. 
  In years past it often made itself known. The zemstvos 
[elective district councils in pre-revolutionary Russia] did 
more than just try to give the state a competent, skilled worker. 
  Having their own income, zemstvos improved the life of their 
province, volost, city or village, based on the specific needs 
of society. In Kaluga Province alone, for example, by the 
beginning of the current century there were 200 hospitals under 
zemstvo management, which employed 4,000 doctors. The relative 
share of allocations for medical aid in the zemstvo budget 
comprised about 26 percent, and for education--30 percent. Funds 
for farm credit were established in the province, and craft 
industry was supported. A technical high school was built in 
Kaluga, craft and railroad vocational technical schools were 
established, as well as a school for doctor's assistants, and 
several men's and women's trade preparatory schools. 
  The idea to recreate, and not to revive, the zemstvo under 
current conditions signifies not only the rebirth of the 
traditions of people's self-government. It is a rebirth of 
citizenship, state consciousness and togetherness. In short, it 
is that common bond which is still capable of saving Russia. The 
idea received support from the Russian Culture Fund and numerous 
local culture funds, the Association of Small and Medium-Sized 
Cities, the Moscow Confederation of Industrialists and 
Entrepreneurs, the Russian Orthodox Church, as well as from 
representatives of the administrations of a number of cities and 
regions. 
  "Concrete endeavors--for the benefit of the Homeland and 
Russian citizens"--that is the slogan of today's zemstvo 
members. And they are ready to act immediately, relying on their 
own efforts. The movement has developed a number of programs 
which have taken into consideration the age-old experience, and 
which are directed toward the social and economic development of 
the regions. They are intended for a long-term period. Thus, the 
"Family" program provides for the organization of medical 
consultation centers, funds for aid to large and low-income 
families, and for the founding of zemstvo-operated maternity 
homes and children's pre-school institutions. (We might add, 
such a nursery school is already in operation in Krasnogorskiy 
Rayon near Moscow.) Particular attention is given to family 
welfare. In cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church, 
old-age homes will be opened at the monasteries. 
  Or, there is also the "Enlightenment" program. It includes 
the preparation and publication of textbooks on the Russian 
language, history and literature, books for extracurricular 
reading, and for stocking the libraries of schools and 
pre-school institutions. There are plans to create a 
wide-circulation and inexpensive series entitled "The Zemstvo 
Library," which will acquaint the reader with an anthology of 
Russian literature, and a series of monument-books in philology, 
art, philosophy and religion. One of the first priority tasks 
will be a program of vocational training for rural youth. 
  Russia is strong in her provinces. These words have become 
almost an incantation. But how does the province live? The 
lion's share of what it earns goes to the federal budget. Only 
3-4 percent is left for the local treasury. Just try to teach, 
cure and elevate culture on this money. In fact, it turns out 
that the local organs of self-government have neither powers and 
authorities, nor financial levers. Only a law on local 
self-government, on new land reform can grant the regions broad 
powers and authorities. 
  The opportunity to help one's native city, village, or 
region 
attracts Russian entrepreneurs to the RZM. Without limiting 
themselves to the charitable bowl of soup, although this too is 
often necessary, they are investing capital in the construction 
of schools and kindergartens, in the restoration of 
architectural monuments and in the repair of hospitals. The 
leader of the movement, Yelena Panina, in October of last year 
instituted and is already paying out three monthly stipends in 
the name of Yekaterina Dashkova to women graduate students at 
scientific-research institutes of the Academy of Sciences. The 
company of Vladimir Sedoy, which is well known in Nizhniy 
Novgorod for its trade enterprises and practice halls, has built 
a school. For the present time, the attendance is comprised of 
only first and second grade children, but Sedov intends to 
expand and add on to it. 
  The RZM is a public association. It is notable that Russian 
citizens themselves--teachers, engineers, scientists, and 
representatives of the creative intelligentsia--act as the 
initiators for organizing its local sections. As in the time of 
Minin and Pozharskiy, the first to act was Nizhniy Novgorod. 
However, the idea was soon picked up by Tver, Kaluga, 
Petrozavodsk, Ufa and Krasnoyarsk. 
  As a form of improving local life, the RZM is capable of 
integrating in itself various national and ethnic peculiarities 
and traditions of the people living on a given territory. The 
Ufa Zemstvo, for example, has unified the Russian, Tatar and 
Bashkir communities. 
  In the lobbies of the congress I had occasion to speak with 
its delegates and guests representing various strata of our 
society. 
  "We, the communists," stressed Gennadiy Zyuganov, Chairman 
of 
the RFCP [Russian Federation Communist Party] Central Executive 
Committee, "view the zemstvo movement as a counterweight to our 
power. Our regional patriotic organizations closely cooperate 
with the local zemstvo sections." 
  This thought was continued by the ottoman of the Kuban 
Cossack troops, Yuriy Serebryakov: 
  "Today we are trying to take power into our hands by 
democratic means, and primarily to take control of our primary 
wealth--the land. We want to manage it ourselves, and not hand 
it over to be squandered away by yesterday's partocrats and 
today's sorry excuses for democrats."

<F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Shipunova: "The Accursed Truth; The Art </F>
and Politics of Stanislav Govorukhin"] 
  [Text] The deeper the disintegration in the state and the 
schism in society, the more persistently annoying becomes the 
question of the intelligentsia's responsibility for all that has 
happened, the intelligentsia which has served as the detonator 
of the destructive processes. Those representatives of the 
scientific and artistic elite who have enough courage to admit 
this, to repent in the error of their ways and to openly speak 
out against the regime whose establishment they at one time 
significantly facilitated, find the most fervent and grateful 
support among the people and are perceived by them on par with 
the leaders of the patriotic resistance. 
  In recent times, we have also seen the well-known film 
producer, actor and writer, State Duma Deputy Stanislav 
Govorukhin, within these ranks. It is enough to recall his 
sharply critical televised speeches during last year's 
pre-electoral campaign (after one of which V. Shumayko even 
proposed excluding the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] from 
participation in the elections), his break with the Union of 
Cinematographers immediately after the October events, and 
now--his delineation from N. Travkin, who signed the treaty on 
accord. Among the actions which required civic courage we may 
cite also S. Govorukhin's last film, "The Great Criminal 
Revolution." The film is perceived as a condemnation of the 
current regime, as documental proof of what the "democratic 
transformations" have brought Russia to. 
  Recently, at the invitation of the coordinating committee of 
the Kuban patriotic movement "Homeland" and the editors of the 
kray newspaper, KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI, Stanislav Govorukhin visited 
Krasnodar. We must note that our city and kray receive their 
share of attention by guests from the capital. In the last year, 
many prominent persons have visited here, beginning with the 
country's president and ending with Masha Rasputina. However, we 
cannot recall anything analogous to the meetings with 
Govorukhin. The large hall of the former House of Political 
Enlightenment was packed to overflowing. People were standing 
shoulder to shoulder in the aisles and sitting on the stage 
steps. Govorukhin showed clips from his film which in essence 
has been banned, and answered questions posed by the 
audience--questions which expressed all the confusion, all the 
tension and all the dissatisfaction of the present-day public 
consciousness and spirit. 
  He began by making an admission which not everyone would 
dare 
make: "I am carrying around a great sin. On 12 June 1991, I went 
to vote for Yeltsin, and what's more--I also misled my wife and 
relatives into doing so. Standing before you is an utter fool, 
and it is even remarkable that so many people have come to see 
him!" 
  No, the people did not come to see "an utter fool." 
Especially since this sin may be ascribed more than just to 
Govorukhin alone. Many people were confused at that time. The 
main thing that attracted the people was the opportunity to hear 
the truth. The truth today is the commodity of which there is 
the greatest shortage, and for which there is a huge demand. 
Govorukhin is well known as a person, a politician who, 
regardless of anything, speaks the truth. 
  He brought with him a book with a title of the same name, 
which was a sort of literary recording of the film. Since the 
television management will not allow the film to be screened, 
the author decided to write a book, which was published by the 
"Andreyevskiy Flag" publishing house in Moscow in a circulation 
of 100,000 copies. Moreover, tens of regional newspapers 
(including KUBANSKIYE NOVOSTI and KUBANSKIY KURYER) have 
reprinted it on their pages. We must note that the editors of 
local papers have also exhibited a certain courage in this. The 
first to publish the book as a separate supplement, back in 
November of last year, was the editor of a Samara newspaper. 
After that, he began to be persecuted--commissions, taxes, 
courts, and finally he ended his life with suicide... 
  Thanks to the newspapers, millions of readers have now 
become 
acquainted with the materials gathered by Govorukhin on his trip 
through Russia--from the western borders to the Pacific Ocean. 
The materials are frightening. There is an unprecedented ongoing 
brazen pilferage of the country through commercial structures, 
through state organizations, and through opportunists from 
abroad. 
  "I get the impression that there is a criminal revolution in 
progress," writes the author. "More accurately, it is being 
completed. The victory will be the final construction of a 
criminal-mafioso state... I call this revolution great, since it 
is not some Panama which has fallen into the grips of the 
criminals, but the sixth largest country on the planet." 
  The film clips show the Russian-Chinese border. Everything 
you can think of is being driven from here to there--non-ferrous 
and precious metals, building Materials, KamAZes, all kinds of 
equipment... They are sending, as if it were scrap metal, 
torpedo engines, silver-zinc storage batteries from submarines, 
the submarines themselves, and military ships. The author of the 
film even found along the way... an army mobile headquarters, 
which was also moving for sale abroad. On the return trip, our 
trucks are bringing nothing, thin air. On our side of the border 
is poverty, on the other--a new Chinese city is being built and 
getting rich. 
  There were pictures taken in Zabaykalsk, where 
everything--shoes, tape recorders, food products--was being 
pilfered off of railroad cars left on side tracks. Moreover, it 
is primarily children who are doing the stealing, looking so 
much like the homeless waifs from the times of the civil war. It 
is as if this is the image of Russia itself--forced into a dead 
end and given over for total pilferage. And these children, who 
do not go to school, with pockets full of money--are they its 
future? 
  The reaction in the auditorium to these pictures: People 
grabbing their heads, sighing heavily, almost groaning. It was 
frightening... 
  Stanislav Sergeyevich was asked: "Have you shown this film 
in 
the Duma?" 
  His response: "I see no sense in showing the film to the 
deputies. The Duma, like society, is divided in two. One half 
knows all this as well as I do, and to show it to the other half 
is useless. I see my only task today in telling the truth to the 
common people, to fulfill, if you will, the legacy of Pushkin: 
'To burn the hearts of people with the word...' From my travels 
throughout the country, I have understood: The people have stood 
up shoulder to shoulder in their opposition to the regime." 
  From the book, "The Great Criminal Revolution" (chapter 
entitled "Choice of Russia"): 
  "All of us have lost her (Russia--S. Sh.) in shouting and 
empty prattle. The blame lies with all of us. And with the 
author of these lines--especially." 
  "It is enough to say that my film, 'We Cannot Live This 
Way,' 
helped Yeltsin to become chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet. 
The following episode took place in the Spring of 1990. Two 
times the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia did not ratify 
Yeltsin as chairman of the Supreme Soviet. A third vote was to 
be held in the morning. The evening before the voting, we drove 
buses up to the building where the congress was being held (the 
buses were given to us by the Moscow Soviet, with which Yeltsin 
later dealt so easily!). We put all the congress deputies on the 
buses and took them to "Mosfilm." There, in the large Standards 
Hall, we showed them the still unedited version of our film, "We 
Cannot Live This Way." And what happened then! About 150 
orthodox communists marched out of the hall in close ranks--as a 
sign of protest. The rest gave a standing ovation. I remember 
the voices from the auditorium: "Tomorrow those who voted 
against Yeltsin will come to their senses." In the morning the 
third vote was held. The congress (that very same congress which 
Yeltsin later fired upon from cannons) elected Yeltsin chairman 
of the Supreme Soviet by a majority of four votes. From chairman 
to president it was a short road. That means I too had a hand in 
the destruction of Russia." 
  "As painful as it is to admit, my honest and sincere work 
(not devoid, of course of delusion) had a destructive effect. 
The viewers turned out to be unprepared for such a waterfall of 
truth which rained down upon their heads. They understood only 
one thing from the film--they would prosecute the communists." 
  "...Aleksandr Zinovyev said it most accurately: `We were 
aiming at communism, but we hit Russia.' And that is what 
happened to me, too: I was aiming at communism, not even at 
communism, but at camp communism of the Leninist-Stalinist type, 
but I hit--Russia..." 
  ...In order to understand things as Govorukhin understands 
them today, one does not necessarily have to be a commuist (he 
never was one). It is enough simply to be an honest, decent 
person. We might add that the heroes of Govorukhin's previous 
artistic films were far removed from politics, but all of them 
were distinguished by real nobleness, some even romantic. These 
were honest, strong and brave people. And a preference 
specifically for these types of heroes, and not the others, says 
something about an artist. 
  I often think: If Vysotskiy were alive today, whom would he 
be with? Could it be those who are singing the praises of the 
new czar?... No, I do not believe that. He could not!... "If a 
friend suddenly turns out to be..." --you will recall from the 
"Vertical," his first permitted song? Govorukhin was friendly 
with Vysotskiy and, it seems, Vysotskiy would not have betrayed 
that friendship. 
  Excerpt from the diary of S. Govorukhin: 
  "Today I read about myself in the newspaper. By the way, I 
found myself in good company--Aleksandr Zinovyev, Tatyana 
Koryagina, Yuriy Vlasov... It turns out that all of us 'have 
fallen out of the coach at some turn in history.' The author of 
the article does not specify which turn this was. I will tell 
him. It was at that very turn when suddenly it became clear that 
swindlers had decided to make use of the fruits of our efforts 
in destroying the totalitarian system, the results of the 
efforts of all society. I can even name the date of that 
historic turn--21 August 1991. And we have no one to blame but 
ourselves. We ourselves placed the banner of democracy in the 
hands of the swindlers." 
  The diary appeared in October of 1993, when work on the film 
and the book was already being completed. The events of 3-4 
October burst into them in unforeseen chapters. They were 
written following hot on the heels of these events, but turned 
out to be surprisingly limited. In making a film on the 
large-scale criminalization of the country, Govorukhin became an 
eyewitness to the gravest crime of our day--the execution of 
parliament. In his book, he called it the "the apotheosis of the 
criminal revolution." 
  Responding to the questions of meeting participants in 
Krasnodar regarding his evaluation of the October events, (no, 
they are not being and will not be forgotten--over half the 
questions were on this topic), S. Govorukhin said: 
  "On 3-4 October, real fascism was wandering throughout the 
streets of Moscow. In the courtyards around the White House they 
were killing and torturing people. There was, for example, a 
deputy, a worker from Kazan. He was a sick man, with a pacemaker 
sewn under his heart. The OMON [Special Purpose Militia 
Detachment] troopers danced on him and broke eight ribs. At that 
same moment, his mother was viewing a broadcast of the shooting 
on television, and she had a severe attack of insulitis." 
  (We might add, one of the most appalling chapters of the 
book 
and the film is the "Testimony of Oleg Germanovich Rumyantsev," 
who was subjected on that black Monday to ferocious beatings, 
insults and fear of death). 
  "But the greatest shock for me," continues Govorukhin, "was 
to stand on the bridge on the morning of 4 October and to see 
how, at every shot from the tanks, the crowd which had gathered 
there applauded and shouted: 'That's the way, that's the way!' 
These were the young people who had chosen "Pepsi," and whom, 
evidently, we had already lost..." 
  Listening to Govorukhin, I, like perhaps many others in the 
hall, thought about those of his colleagues in art who had taken 
an entirely different position during those days. It seems to 
me, disenchantment with politicians is not as painfully 
experienced by the people as disenchantement with their favorite 
artists, writers and producers. Politicians arrive on the scene, 
do their deeds, and leave. And others come to take their 
place--that is the way it is. Yet the artists became idols long 
before the present-day tragedies. They were always known and 
loved, and none of them can be replaced--a empty space remains. 
  Many we simply do not know about, where they are, with whom. 
They are quiet, they have faded into the shadows. The people 
take betrayal by their idols more acutely to heart because it is 
specifically the "people's" idols, the ones who are most loved, 
those who created the standards of Heroes, Generals, and Honest 
People that are now the betrayers. 
  At the meeting with Govorukhin, people asked: But why 
Ulyanov, and why Ryazanov... why? 
  "This is a question not for me, but for them," he avoided 
giving a direct answer. "Just keep in mind that there are many, 
very many people in art who think differently. But it is another 
matter that they are not receiving such a tribune in the press 
and on television as those who support this power. Take 
Rasputin, Bondarchuk and Rozov, for example... When, immediately 
after the October events, I made a public announcement about my 
departure from the Union of Cinematographers, the first to call 
me with words of support were Tatyana Lioznova, Leonid Filatov, 
Sergey Shakurov, and Stanislav Lyubshin... And then I thought: 
How many honest and decent people there still are, who think 
like you and me, who love Russia and its people!" 
  Later, talking with Stanislav Sergeyevich, I returned to 
this 
question, whose answer did not entirely suit me: Why? Why, 
nevertheless? We do not want to think about primitive greed, 
about cowardice, about a conscious absence of love for all that 
is dear. You begin thinking up excuses for writers and actors 
who were once your favorites: Maybe they are sincerely confused, 
maybe they are ashamed to admit that they once made a mistake? I 
cannot, for example, agree with the fact that such a prominent 
writer as Viktor Astafyev does not see, does not understand, 
what is really going in Russia. Perhaps he and many others have 
simply locked themselves into their cycle of opposition to the 
past, and it will still not let go of them and continues to dim 
their view? 
  Govorukhin does not accept such mitigating explanations. He 
is merciless: 
  "No, no, that is not it! Understand that our intelligentsia 
faithfully serves any power, especially when it is strong. They 
did not really serve Yeltsin before, but as soon as it became 
clear (in October) that he held the power... This is common 
cowardice." 
  "And nothing more?" 
  "No, of course not. They all do not serve for free. One is 
invited to lecture, another is given money for a film, a third 
one has his book sent to the West for publication... After all, 
look what is happening: When we had power of the workers and 
peasants, the heroes of our films were also workers and 
peasants. Recently, I conductedd a special analysis of up to 100 
films. The heroes were all thieves, prostitutes, `outcasts,' 
etc. Because now what we have is power of the criminals, and our 
art already serves this power. Then others will come, and they 
will make films about them. Just stop and think: A satirist, who 
is destined to be out of sorts with the authorities, gets a 
medal!..." 
  "That means there is a rebirth?" 
  "I do not know. I only know that the Russian 
intelligentsia--under the czar, and under Stalin, and under 
Brezhnev--was in opposition to power. Perhaps in the kitchen 
opposition, but in the opposition nevertheless. And 
suddenly--the most petty, the most thieving power, and--not only 
are they not in opposition, but it is real love! Meanwhile, 
Russian culture is perishing and being substituted for Western 
culture. Movie theatres are closing. There are no libraries. 
Where is cinema? There is none. And there will not be, because 
one cannot create art based on lies and bribery. The only person 
who can create a great work in cinematography today is Nikita 
Mikhalkov. And literature? It is also absent. The most 
'outstanding' book in recent times has been the 'Notes of the 
President.' The intelligentsia is in ecstasy! Although the name 
of the journalist who wrote it is known to all." 
  With these words, I recalled the theme of the television 
program, "Novosti": Mark Zakharov, speaking at the presentation 
of the book, said: "I am astounded by the simplicity of this 
book!". 
  "Yet at one time," continues Govorukhin, "they would not 
even 
shake Ye. Matveyev's hand because he played Brezhnev, or V. 
Tikhonov's, who read "Small Land" on television. 
  No, Stanislav Sergeyevich does not feel sorry for his 
brothers in the artistic shop... Perhaps there are cowards and 
greedy men among them. But an important role, it seems to me, 
has been played by the following. 
  At the beginning of perstroyka, Gorbachev, as we recall, 
flirted strongly with the intelligentsia. Prominent leaders in 
science and culture began to be included in the president's 
council, elected to the party leadership and the Supreme Soviet, 
and even appointed as ministers. Far from the most outstanding 
of Soviet scientists--G. Popov and A. Sobchak--suddenly became 
mayors of two Russian capitals. Among the intelligentsia, which 
had not been spoiled with high state positions, this gave rise 
to certain illusions, including the one that the power was now 
in their hands. If before the opinion of the intelligentsia in 
state affairs was not overly sought after, under Gorbachev this 
opinion began to be given overly great attention. For example, 
an article by A. Nuykin or N. Shmelev was enough to undertake 
another review of the country's economic policy. Gorbachev was 
very prone to the influence of the radical intelligentsia, and 
cared most about his image specifically with that part of 
society which, in turn, was becoming ever more self-assured and 
demanding, pushing first Gorbachev and then Yeltsin toward ever 
more radical actions. First to the repeal of certain articles of 
the constitution, then to agree to the separation of Lithuania, 
then to the break-up of the Union, then to the disbanding of 
parliament... And that is how we got to October of '93. 
  From the diary of S. Govorukhin: 
  "Who called us to `decisive actions'? It was not only the 
`reds' who called us to arms. The artistic intelligentsia also 
called for bloody reprisals. Only because of its inborn 
cowardice did it call for volunteers not from its own ranks--it 
called for the army and the militia to accomplish these feats." 
  "...One after another on the screen we see popular artists 
and artistic leaders. They have come out of the trenches. 
Risking their lives, they have come to Shabolovka. The artistic 
leaders, interrupting each other, swore their allegiance to 
power. Almost every other speaker demanded harsh punishment for 
the apostates. `Shoot them, guillotine them... Put them on 
display at the zoo!' Yet all the while I recalled Solzhenitzin's 
`Calf.' Everything--not quite like that, but everything was very 
similar." 
  "...Yet the communists were a bit softer. And a bit more 
honest. Those three days in August I spent in the White House, 
defending `democracy.' No one turned off our telephone or our 
lights. We lived quite comfortably. I remember the last night 
with Rastropovich. The champagne flowed like a river. No one 
attacked us or surrounded us. On the contrary, we bristled up 
with the barrels of tank cannons." 
  Upon meeting any artist or well-known leader, people thirst 
to hear from him not only words of truth, to quench themselves 
with unknown information which had been concealed from them, to 
get a confirmation of their own thoughts and judgements. They 
also want to hear an intelligible answer to the question: What 
to do? What is the way out of the situation? This is the 
expression of eternal hope of the people toward their leaders, 
the eternal hope of the province toward their mother-capital. 
  And so it was this time. The people questioned Govorukhin: 
What next? And he answered honestly: I do not know. 
  He had a positive appraisal of Rutskoy: "He is not 
a friend to me, but I like him for his directness. He is an 
interesting person, multi-faceted, talented in different areas." 
Although Govorukhin does not believe in his chances to become 
president. 
  About Zhirinovskiy he expressed alarm: "There are 
two of him. One speaks, and the other acts. In words he is a 
fierce enemy of the regime, but in his actions--he is a man of 
the president... He is precise, calculating and smart... He has 
mastered the art of 'dirty politics.' He will bring many more 
misfortunes. I would not say that he has no chance to become 
president. So consider the history of the LDPR 
[Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia], just in case." 
  About Travkin he noted that he had signed the 
treaty on accord in spite of the opinion of the DPR [Democratic 
Party of Russia] faction in the State Duma. Govorukhin himself 
is not a member of the DPR, and only went in a block with this 
party to the elections. After 28 April he made the announcement 
in the newspaper PRAVDA that he will not make any agreement with 
this power (he calls them the "thimble men"). 
  About Solzhenitsyn, whom he respects as being the 
greatest Russian writer of those living today, he said that the 
recent events in Russia seem to have separated them. "I wrote to 
him honestly in a letter about what happened here. After that 
our relations were disrupted. In May he is coming to Russia. We 
will see what he says." 
  And finally, not without some interest--about 
Gorbachev: "I met him a few times. He has gotten much 
smarter. As I was speaking to him, I was thinking: What a smart 
man, he is the one who should be president! But he was, alas, he 
was! And he could have made the people happy, but instead he 
made them unhappy." 
  "Well, who then, who finally will make Russia and the people 
happy? And whom do you yourself support? For whom are you?", the 
Krasnodar residents asked. 
  "For the present, I do not see any great state leader such 
as 
Peter I, which Russia needs so desperately today. Power today is 
very strong. And in order to oppose it, the opposition must 
unite. That is why I went to the `Agreement in the Name of 
Russia' movement. But as yet the opposition cannot present a 
single leader. He does not exist. Although I do not believe that 
such a great spiritual country as ours will not give birth to 
such an individual, perhaps he is somewhere on the way." 
  Some of the most active patriots, who were literally rushing 
into battle, left the meeting a bit disillusioned: He had 
stirred up their souls, but he never did tell them what to do. 
He did not instill any optimism. I too was at first disappointed 
by this pessimism of his. Even his book ends on this same note: 
"These days, an optimist can only be either a fool or a 
scoundrel." 
  But then I thought that this is not pessimism, but realism. 
That ultimately he is an artist. His business is to see and tell 
people the truth. "To burn with the word..." To stir up, to 
awaken. 
  And only the people themselves can change their life for the 
better, when they stop enduring and keeping silent. 
  When they finally understand that we cannot live this 
way.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Vasiliy Likhachev, vice-president </F>
of the Republic of Tatarstan and doctor of juridical sciences, 
conducted by correspondent Dmitriy Lukashov: "Vasiliy Likhachev: 
It Is Not Yet Clear To Whom the Realization of the Treaty 
Between Russia and Tatarstan Will Bring Greater Political 
Capital..."] 
  [Text] [Begin boxed material] Three months have passed 
since the day of conclusion of the "Treaty of the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Tatarstan `On Delineation of 
Objects of Management and Mutual Delegation of Powers and 
Authorities Between the Agencies of State Power of the Russian 
Federation and the Agencies of State Power of the Republic of 
Tatarstan'." 
  Today in Tatariya they no longer speak pretty words on this 
subject, but have begun to think about how to live in the 
future. A program is being development to bring the economy out 
of crisis (and this crisis is obvious, since even oil drilling 
is at a standstill). Most likely, major reforms await the local 
government. The republic authorities, whose main words during 
these last three years have been: "As soon as we conclude the 
treaty with Russia...," and which have directed all their 
efforts specifically toward this end, to the detriment of the 
economy, are now faced with the problem of realizing the treaty 
and implementing real reform. 
  This was the subject of discussion between our correspondent 
in Kazan and one of the "fathers" of the treaty, vice-president 
of the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] and doctor of juricial 
sciences, Professor Vasiliy Likhachev. [End boxed material] 
  [Correspondent] Vasiliy Nikolayevich, it seems to me that 
the 
period of euphoria following the signing of the treaty with 
Russia in February has passed. The comments by leaders of 
Tatariya, including yours, ever more often express the thought 
that it is time to start realizing this treaty. Of what should 
this consist, first of all? 
  [Likhachev] Well, first of all I must say that the treaty is 
already in effect. This is expressed, specifically, in the fact 
that the government of Russia and the federal ministry have 
finally begun to perceive us as normal partners whose opinion 
must be listened to. And today the factor of our republic in the 
political life of Russia and the CIS is not simply the factor of 
a former autonomy which has travelled a certain path toward 
formulation of statehood. It is the image of a rather competent 
politician with an all-Russian, all-CIS reputation as 
represented by an entire republic. 
  As for the intra-republic aspects of the treaty's 
realization, it will receive the support of the population only 
if it is oriented toward the specific individual. Specifically, 
immediately after we signed this treaty, people came up to me on 
the streets and in the stores and thanked me. They perceived 
this treaty as a means of solving their problems--from the 
national to the everyday. 
  From this standpoint, the economic aspects of realization of 
the treaty with Russia are beginning to worry me more and more. 
Therefore, during the last meetings with the leadership of 
Russia, and specifically with Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg 
Soskovets, we discussed questions of economic stabilization to a 
greater degree. 
  This treaty has synonymously entered political history. And 
no matter what anyone says today, no matter what lengthy 
articles are written, the event has come to pass. It is an 
entirely logical event which has justified the hopes of most of 
the republic's residents. 
  [Correspondent] You said that the treaty must be oriented 
toward specific problems... 
  [Likhachev] Of course, it is difficult to lay out all the 
pluses and minuses on a bookkeeper's abacus. First of all, we 
must mention that the treaty allows us to create a normal state. 
The level of responsibility of this state is increasing. The 
need for increasing the intellect, competency and 
professionalism of its public officials is increasing. 
Ultimately, this will be a benefit for the people. I am not even 
speaking of some specific projects whose realization would be 
impossible without mutual understanding with Russia. Moreover, 
the treaty also removes many questions of international 
relations: It places at the forefront the problems of human 
rights and respect for the individual regardless of nationality. 
  The so-called common man, of course, wants things he can 
understand--low prices, low rent, peace on the streets and 
material well-being. However, we cannot expect immediate 
benefits from this document. 
  Moreover, without the active inclusion of the republic's 
citizens in the realization of the treaty--not in perception on 
the level of "like-dislike," but specifically in creative and 
conscious work--it is unlikely that we will be able to 
accomplish anything. Do not think I am trying to be coy. We are 
speaking here of the formation of a civil society in the 
republic. The complexity of the signed document consists of the 
fact that we, making an effort to depart from the former system, 
have nevertheless not gone away from it, but have built a picket 
fence of theses from the dictionary of the market economy. 
Marketing, management, investments--we hear these words every 
day, several times a day. But ask the common man what they mean, 
and he will shrug his shoulders at best. Politicians, economists 
and the people seem to be living in different dimensions. Some 
complain about the lack of education of the people. Others 
simply do not understand anything. This is very dangerous, 
because the average citizen does not feel himself to be a member 
of society and, it seems, soon he will become totally 
indifferent to what is being said there, "at the top." This 
difficulty will, naturally, be expressed in the realization of 
the treaty. 
  [Correspondent] Is the process of realization of the treaty 
currently being formulated in a documental manner? 
  [Likhachev] Yes, a draft program of action by the agencies 
of 
state power of the republic on realization of the treaty with 
Russia has been developed within the apparatus of the president 
and the cabinet of ministers. There is a supplement to this 
program which points out the need for adopting various edicts, 
laws and decrees. Moreover, it contains a list of supplemental 
agreements and treaties with the Russian Federation. 
  In working on this document, the experts proceeded from the 
fact that, first of all, the treaty directly points out the 
presence of specific agreements--on transport, foreign policy, 
higher education and so forth. And secondly, the need for 
adoption of such documents is dictated by life itself. 
  I might add that the shortest time alotted for preparation 
of 
various agreements is by the end of 1995. 
  In this connection, I would like to turn to the problem of 
reforming the republic's apparatus of state structures. It is in 
need of rejuvenation. I believe this process must begin soon... 
  [Correspondent] Some time after the adoption of the 
Declaration on State Sovereignty and before the signing of the 
treaty with Russia, none of the leaders of Tatariya, including 
you, ever directly answered the question of whether the republic 
is within the make-up of the Russian Federation. From this 
angle, the problem of the existence of Tatariya as a state is 
not being overly reviewed even today. Yet, in my opinion, from 
the treaty it clearly follows that the republic is nevertheless 
within the make-up of Russia. Having signed this treaty, have 
you not closed that door which opened the way to adoption of 
more and more new decisions securing and strengthening the 
position of the republic which, ultimately, could have led to 
ideal results for many of the political forces of the republic? 
  [Likhachev] From the very start of negotiations with the 
organs of power of Russia, and even before, we knew where we 
were going. Our tactical steps were not always substantiated and 
justified, but we always kept our strategic goal in view. 
  Whether the treaty turns out to be specifically such depends 
largely on the time factor. Had we concluded it a big sooner or 
a big later, it would have been somewhat different, perhaps 
closer to the ideal. However, the limit of time and the limit of 
confidence of the people had already been exhausted. After all, 
we cannot say for almost 3 years: Wait a bit longer, we will 
define ourselves soon. Negotiations continued, but there were no 
specific results--neither agreements, nor a treaty. And, 
naturally, after a certain time the question of confidence in 
the president and the state structures of the republic would 
have arisen. 
  The treaty states that, "...the Republic of Tatarstan is a 
state united with the Russian Federation..." My 
colleagues--jurists in Moscow and in Europe--evaluated this 
formulation as being rather flexible. Such flexibility has 
allowed us to adopt many elements of life of the Federation 
while at the same time retaining our own, legitimized, view of 
our existence. In this case, and I repeat this for the 101st 
time, we cannot approach the question with standard measures--"a 
little federation-confederation." This is a certain intermediate 
model which corresponds to the given historical period, the 
expression of will of the people of the republic at the 
referendum of 21 March 1992. And, undoubtedly, it does not close 
off the path to development of the Russian Federation, to 
modernization of its state-legal forms, as well as to the 
movement of Tatarstan toward strengthening and expanding its 
independence. 
  It is quite another matter that it is reasonable to fear the 
realization of the treaty in the sense that it is not yet 
provided with cadres, finances, or currency... However, if it 
did not exist, we would simply not have paid attention to many 
aspects of the republic's existence, just as we do not pay 
attention to our own miscalculations. If it turns out well, we 
are good fellows. If it does not turn out--Moscow is to blame. 
This, after all, is the most comfortable position... 
  In my opinion, the positive moment of signing of the treaty 
between Russia and Tatarstan is obvious. We were the first and, 
God willing, not the last in Russia to show that we can achieve 
what we want by political methods instead of tanks. The 
leadership of Russia, in turn, demonstrated that it is capable 
of perceiving the new and of resolving at the negotiating table 
any contradictions which may arise. Now we must prove to the 
people with specific examples that the process of reforming 
Russia is in progress. Not only the leadership of the republic 
is interested in the treaty's realization, but also the 
leadership of Russia. And it is still unclear to whom it will 
ultimately give the greatest political capital. 
  [Correspondent] By the way, in regard to earning political 
capital. The fact of signing of the treaty, it seems to me, has 
stirred up the extreme forces in the republic, activated them. 
In all probability, with the signing of the treaty, the 
opposition, which previously was in a state of ignorance and 
then also a state of confusion, now has grounds and a subject 
for criticism of the republic's leadership... 
  [Likhachev] That is so, but it seems to me that in many 
people who call themselves politicians, the sense of political 
feel has simply been dulled. Since the referendum, criticism of 
this treaty cannot speak about anything else. 
  Opposition is necessary in any society. But our opposition 
is 
acting strangely somehow. Those who call themselves federalists 
want Russia to be a unitarian state. The nationalists, 
meanwhile, strive to get maximum independence and full state 
separation from Russia. In doing so, both become removed from 
real life in their aspirations. 
  The credo of the republic's leadership consists of following 
the main postulate of physicians: Do not cause harm. 
  [Correspondent] During the period of the treaty's 
preparation, the republic authorities spoke about the fact that, 
having delegated a large part of the powers and authorities of 
Tatariya, Moscow will also give it a greater portion of 
responsibility. And the republic authorities, in turn, would 
readily accept this responsibility. In other words, they have 
taken out a promissory note of trust from the people, and now 
the time has come to repay it. And, perhaps, it would be 
entirely logical if people blame not Yeltsin, but Sheymiyev for 
the high prices in the stores. And no one will listen to 
explanations that, supposedly, the Moscow authorities are 
conducting an inept financial and tax policy, that the printing 
press which encourages inflation works not in Kazan, but in 
Moscow... Are you not afraid of such responsibility? 
  [Likhachev] Only foolish people are not afraid of anything. 
Our situation is rather difficult. On one hand, we have 
formulated our independence, and on the other--we find ourselves 
in a unified economic, cultural and other types of space with 
Russia. It will be very difficult to ensure a standard which 
differs for the better from the average Russian indicators. Yet 
we must do so, because the people need not some political and 
legal formulas, but specific results. This is the problem for 
today and tomorrow, and this is a tactical problem. Yet the 
strategy has been and remains as before: The republic is a 
state, and must realize its economic and political sovereignty. 
And this includes reforming the supreme organs of state power, 
creating a full-fledged system of organs of local 
self-government, training high-class administrative cadres, 
ensuring a normal living standard, and so forth. 
  The tasks, as you see, are not the easiest. But there is 
nowhere to go. The promissory note, after all, really does have 
to be repaid...

<F P=106> [Article by Ildar Tukmakov, deputy chairman of the National </F>
Bank of Tatarstan: "Banks Continue To Grow"] 
  [Text] The continuing development of the banking 
system has now been registered in the republic: New banks are 
opening; chains of branches, including those outside Tatarstan, 
are expanding; statutory funds of banks and their assets are 
growing. 
  As of 1 April of this year 38 registered commercial banks 
with 59 branches, of which 11 were outside the republic, 
operated in the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  Compared to 1 January 1992, the number of commercial banks 
registered in Tatarstan increased from 17 to 38, and 
branches--from eight to 59. During the period in question, the 
statutory fund of banks grew from R305.4 million to R28 billion. 
  In addition, the Tatagroprombank and 49 of its branches 
which 
mainly serve enterprises and organizations of the 
agro-industrial complex and rural rayons of the Republic of 
Tatarstan operate in the territory of the republic. 
  As far as the branches of out-of-town banks are concerned, a 
branch of the Inkotransbank commercial bank (Nizhniy Novgorod) 
has been opened in Kazan. 
  Of 38 commercial banks, six are public joint-stock companies 
that offer their shares for unrestricted sale; 15 are privately 
held joint-stock companies, that is, selling shares only to 
their shareholders; 17 banks have been established on a 
contributory basis. 
  At present, 14 commercial banks in the republic hold 
licenses 
to perform banking operations with foreign exchange which are 
issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation after at 
least one year of banking activities. These banks include the 
Tatsotsbank, the Tatpromstroybank (Kazan), and the Kama 
Industrial Bank (Naberezhnye Chelny). They hold general licenses 
with the right to perform foreign exchange operations both in 
the Russian Federation and outside it. 
  Four commercial banks have an expanded license with a 
restricted right to foreign exchange operations with just six 
foreign banks. Seven commercial banks have domestic licenses 
granting the right to perform foreign exchange operations solely 
through correspondent accounts at the banks holding general 
licenses. 
  Based on the results of operations in 1993, commercial banks 
contributed to the budget more than R23 billion in the form of 
income-based payments, paid to their shareholders and partners 
R13.9 billion in dividends, and transferred R8.7 billion to 
centralized, insurance, reserve, and other mandatory funds. 
  Based on the results of operation in the first quarter of 
this year, 13 commercial banks turned a loss in the amount of 
R4.9 billion. 
  An analysis of the operation of banks indicates that the 
commercial banks generated a loss because of the deterioration 
of the repayment of credit and the interest on it by borrowers. 
  At the same time, almost all banks met their commitments to 
pay interest on holdings and the deposits of the population, as 
well as on interbank credit, which was reflected in the results 
of their operations and the generation of a loss. 
  The development of the banking system necessitates the 
further capitalization of the charters [as published] and assets 
of banks, collateral, and guarantees of their reliability and 
creditworthiness. 
  At present, 13 out of 38 commercial banks have statutory 
capital amounting to or exceeding R1 billion, including only 
seven with statutory capital of R2 billion or more: the 
Tatpromstroybank, the Tatsotsbank, the Kaminbank (Naberezhnye 
Chelny), the Interkamabank and the Idel-Ural (Nizhnekamsk), the 
Selkhozbank (Mendeleyevsk), and the Akbarsbank (Kazan). 
  Attracting funds to accounts in the banks and subsequently 
placing them in the form of credit extended to enterprises and 
organizations with all forms of ownership, primarily for 
measures associated with the development and support for the 
economy of the republic, is one of the significant tasks of 
commercial banks. 
  During the period 1 January of last year and 1 April of this 
year, the volume of funds raised through bank accounts increased 
from R147.1 billion to R1,061.1 billion, including those 
attracted in the form of holdings--from R9.1 billion to R100.5 
billion, and in the form of deposits of the population--from 
R0.7 billion to R75 billion. 
  Efforts to attract interbank credit were stepped up, 
including its attraction through a chain of branches in other 
regions. As of 1 April of this year, interbank credit from other 
regions exceeded R65 billion. 
  We should note in particular efforts to attract the deposits 
of the population and pay to it guaranteed interest rates as 
protection against systematic inflation and depreciation of the 
currency. The efforts of banks in this area are not easy; they 
entail credit risks and direct losses to individual banks. 
Despite this, such efforts are made in the interests of the 
entire population. 
  With a view to assisting their clients in overcoming the 
payments crisis and facilitating the acceleration of settlements 
with enterprises in other regions, the commercial banks of the 
republic, in addition to expanding the chain of their branches, 
are vigorously establishing correspondent relations by way of 
opening correspondent accounts at other banks and effecting 
out-of-town payments between relevant enterprises through them. 
  The Volga-Kama Joint-Stock Bank has an extensive network of 
correspondent accounts which make it possible to perform direct 
settlements, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Izhevsk, 
Chelyabinsk, Perm, Kaliningrad, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk, 
Nizhniy Novgorod, Ulyanovsk, and Yaketerinburg. 
  Along with the Volga-Kama Bank, the Tatpromstroybank, the 
Tatsotsbank, the Zarechye, the Kambiznesbank, the Kama 
Industrial Bank, the Avtogradbank, and the MNB Continent 
vigorously operate in this area. 
  Last year, 20 commercial banks floated 32 issues of 
securities registered by the National Bank in the form of bank 
shares. The banks placed the securities both among their 
shareholders and by way of unrestricted sales to the population. 
  At the same time, despite the fact that six public 
joint-stock banks, i.e. banks whose shares may be freely sold 
and bought on the on the secondary market (exchanges), operate 
in Tatarstan at present, only the shares of the Volga-Kama 
Joint-Stock Banks are quoted on the Moscow Central Stock 
Exchange. This indicates the poor activity of the banks in the 
securities market both in the republic and outside of it. 
  In addition to shares, the National Bank has registered 
conditions for the issuance of deposit and savings certificates 
of commercial banks; last year, six banks issued their own bank 
bills of exchange. 
  The aforementioned securities (certificates, bills of 
exchange) are issued for the purpose of both raising funds in 
bank accounts and effecting settlements with them without 
withdrawing the corresponding ready cash from the banks. 
  The unstable economic situation causes changes in the 
operation of commercial banks. 
  Despite the general growth of the resource base of 
commercial 
banks, a number of banks are experiencing a considerable 
resource shortage. Within the structure of attracted funds, a 
considerable growth of nontraditional sources of credit 
resources has been registered, specifically, of credit received 
from other banks, holdings, and deposits. 
  The extension of credit for periods of no more than three 
months, and at individual banks for periods of no more than one 
month, has developed extensively. 
  Complex economic policies necessitate adjustments in the 
investment policy of commercial banks, too. At present, they 
prefer to extend credit for operations involving tangible 
merchandise while formalizing the collateral and insuring their 
credit. 
  In generalizing the above, we should note yet again that the 
banks of the republic are now vigorously mastering a broad array 
of banking services on the basis of perfecting technical support 
for them and improving the professionalism of the banks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Tatarstan Needs Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] On the eve of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet 
session, which opens on Monday and whose task will be to 
consider the government's anticrisis program, the sociological 
service of the Inform-Club-ES agency under the sponsorship of 
IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA conducted an express poll of Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet deputies. 
  1. Do you believe that Tatarstan's Cabinet of Ministers is 
capable of functioning effectively in its current composition? 
  Yes30 percent 
  No45 percent 
  No opinion25 percent 
  2. What is your assessment of the economic situation in 
Tatarstan? 
  Situation stable3.5 percent 
  Situation critical2.3 percent 
  Pre-crisis situation54.0 percent 
  Crisis situation40.0 percent 
  3. Does Tatarstan's parliamentary system need to be 
reformed? 
  Yes76.5 percent 
  No19.0 percent 
  No opinion4.7 percent 
  Among parliament members who are directly involved in 
decisionmaking as part of the executive authority (heads of 
local administration, enterprise directors) and who hold about 
one-third of the seats in the parliament, the mood is even more 
radical than in the deputy corps as a whole. In this group, 36 
percent are convinced that changes in the government are 
necessary. They also look more critically at the current 
economic situation in Tatarstan. 
  As to deputy groups and factions, the following picture 
emerges. 
  Representatives of the Party of Unity and Progress believe 
that the priority task for the parliament is to change the tax 
system and intend to state their position at the session. 
  The Equality and Legality bloc believes that the issue of 
cabinet membership per se is not important--the system of 
administration as a whole needs to be changed. 
  The group Tatarstan expresses the opinion that the 
government 
has not kept the promise it had given to the parliament, and 
instead of an anticrisis program has submitted another 
declarative document on a number of priority measures. The 
bloc's representatives intend to voice their complaints on this 
subject in the parliament. 
  In the course of the survey, 85 deputies were 
polled--35 percent of the deputy corps. The survey was done on 
the telephone by random selection. The results are 
representative.

<F P=106> [Report of R. Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic </F>
of Tatarstan, at 20th, Special, Session of the Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet on 6 June 1994: "Revisions to the 
Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the 
Republic of Tatarstan"] 
  [Text] We are discussing at this session an urgent 
present-day problem--how to avert increasing crisis phenomena in 
the republic's economy. 
  The most important question arises: What is the situation 
with regard to people's daily urgent requirements, and what can 
we guarantee them in the foreseeable future? Unless an answer to 
this question is obtained, how can we win the trust and support 
of our population in the business of the continued 
implementation of reforms? We need to find within ourselves 
courage and honesty and tell primarily ourselves and the people 
what our lives will be like henceforward: What will the living 
standard be, how can we pay worthy tribute to our veterans for 
their labor invested in the name of our welfare, what will be 
the fate of our children today, and what will they inherit from 
us tomorrow. 
  We need to make our position clear--the economy for man or 
man for the economy. 
  Our practical actions will be the answer to all these 
difficult questions. It is from these positions that I would 
like to discuss all problems connected with the government's 
social policy for this period of time in respect primarily to 
children and veterans, and in our republic they constitute more 
than 2.3 million persons, or 55 percent of the total number of 
inhabitants. We all need to recognize that, in any event, 
regardless of the state of the economy, concern for their living 
standard is on our conscience and will depend on the results of 
the labor of those in work and the efficiency of the state 
mechanism of income redistribution, that is, the budget. 
  Considering that the subsistence level, which, as we know, 
prevents death by starvation, today constitutes approximately 
R50,000 a month per person and that, in addition, subsidized 
payments in the amount of approximately R30,000 are allocated 
from the republic budget monthly for each inhabitant of the 
republic, regardless of his income level, which constitutes R11 
billion, the subsistence level for children and veterans 
guaranteed by society will thus constitute approximately R80,000 
a month on average. This is the line beyond which lies 
starvation, the degradation of the personality, and social 
upheaval, with all the ensuing consequences. This means that we 
have as of the present to guarantee from various sources of 
funding (the wages of those in work, the retirement fund, the 
targeted social protection fund, the republic budget) the 
appropriation of a minimum of R162 billion of [word illegible] 
funds, R85 billion of this for children. For what proportion of 
this expenditure can the state realistically provide, and for 
what, the working section of the populace? 
  Let us try to comprehend how efficiently we are working, 
what 
the efficiency of our economy is, and what is dependent on all 
of us for the creation of opportunities for an increase in the 
growth [as published] of income of the approximately R1.5 
million persons employed in the republic. 
  Inasmuch as foodstuffs account for the bulk of individual 
spending, I shall permit myself to start with agriculture here. 
  It is hard to exaggerate the role of agricultural production 
in the republic's economy. It is thanks largely to the 
agricultural workers and the single-minded work of the president 
of the republic, the administration chiefs, and the agricultural 
activists that the stable provision of the republic's populace 
with food has been established. 
  The living standard of those employed in agricultural 
production, and this is 17 percent of the republic's able-bodied 
population, is markedly higher than in the Russian Federation on 
average. Thus, the average monthly wage in the month of April in 
agriculture constituted R94,200, which is 25 percent higher than 
analogous indicators for Russia, and this despite the fact that 
the average monthly wage in Russia in the national economy as a 
whole is 20 percent higher than in Tatarstan. This means that 
the rural worker is not only worthily discharging his 
obligations to the children and veterans, but has taken on some 
of the obligations of the employees of industry on 
administrative leave. 
  We see the development of the positive trends of a rise in 
the living standard by way of an increase in the income of the 
agricultural workers in the realization of the following 
principles: 
  --the establishment of private ownership of the land, 
starting with long-term land leasehold relationships and an 
increase in the size of the subsidiary plots; 
  --state protectionism in the sales markets; 
  --a binding obligation on the part of the state in respect 
to 
timely payments for agricultural products that it has 
commissioned; 
  --a voluntary approach in the choice of forms of management 
and the sale of one's own products; 
  --a differentiated pricing policy. 
  During the consideration of the bills on social policy 
submitted to the session today, the observations and 
expectations expressed by the administration chiefs and kolkhoz 
and sovkhoz leaders to the effect that we are not taking account 
of the income obtained from the subsidiary plots when 
determining the amount of the compensation payments from the 
targeted social support fund proved very useful. The draft 
revisions to the Targeted Social Protection Program contains, 
considering your expressed wishes, a procedure of the 
determination of aggregate per capita income with regard to the 
income from the personal subsidiary plots. 
  The situation in industry is far more complicated. We are 
talking about 526,000 employees, or 35 percent of persons 
employed in the republic's economy. 
  It is here, unfortunately, that the most negative trends in 
terms of the living standard are being observed. The average 
monthly wage in the industry of Tatarstan, for example, is 26 
percent lower than the analogous indicator for Russia. It may be 
observed also that in the past nine months the ratio in industry 
of the average wage per employee to the subsistence level has 
declined by a factor of 1.5. It is not hard to imagine what will 
have happened by the end of the present year if this trend 
persists. 
  It would be unfair not to mention that, despite the entire 
complexity of the situation, a number of major industrial 
enterprises and associations such as the Tatneft Stock Company, 
the Kama Truck Plant Stock Company, petrochemical plants, and 
others are managing to maintain the living standard of the 
employees and their families and, in a number of cases, to raise 
it, even. Such enterprises should, understandably, be supported 
by the state first and foremost, and they, in turn, should 
guarantee those employed in production a minimum wage not less 
than the cost of the minimum consumer budget. 
  Similar approaches should be employed in respect to all 
other 
enterprises also on the basis of a selective approach [as 
published]. It is essential, when employing the selective 
approach, aside from all else, to use a separate balance sheet 
with the introduction of accounts for expenditure on the social 
infrastructure. These accounts will afford an opportunity to see 
the viability of basic production and make it possible to obtain 
information on the cost of social functions, which should 
subsequently be assumed by the state. 
  Unfortunately, we have to affirm that at a number of 
enterprises the extent of sold output is insufficient for 
allocations to the retirement fund and the payment of wages at 
least up to the subsistence level. Availing themselves of the 
absence of a mechanism of state control, these enterprises have 
begun a process of self-corrosion: On the strength of 
enterprises' public assets, created to a large extent by the 
labor of previous generations, they are obtaining from the banks 
financial resources at a high rate of interest and channeling 
more than 75 percent of these resources into the wage fund. Each 
ruble thus borrowed from the bank and channeled into this 
corrosion requires society to pay back to the bank within a year 
no fewer than R2.5. A process of the self-corrosion of the 
resources of all of society and our national wealth thus arises. 
  In addition, such social dependence based on free resources 
and an absence of responsibility has engendered and is 
increasing rapidly various forms of concealed unemployment. The 
motivation to labor is disappearing, wage-leveling is 
flourishing. As of today, concealed unemployment numbers 
approximately 200,000 persons. Would it not be more beneficial 
to give society this ruble from the employment fund, thereby 
saving R2.5? Would it not make more sense to channel these 
resources into the return of the arrears to the countryside by 
means of the building of facilities of a social infrastructure 
and for the development of the health care, culture, education, 
and intellectual potential of society, and also for an increase 
in the financial support for veterans? 
  A specific mechanism of realization of the program for the 
support of veterans could be the government's transfer of part 
of the state's share of the stock in privatized enterprises for 
management by specialized trust companies and those same banks, 
but on an entirely different, commercial, basis. The resources 
obtained from this should be channeled into an enhancement of 
veterans' living standard. We would thereby be ensuring fairness 
in the privatization of public property created to a large 
extent by the labor of preceding generations. 
  Merely in respect to 27 industrial enterprises that were 
surveyed, the sum total of arrears to the banks amounts to R39 
billion, which constitutes the lion's share of the value of 
these enterprises' assets. There is something here for us all to 
think about and to decide what we will, in fact, leave our 
children. 
  The question arises: Who allowed the banks to dispose of 
public assets, and what has happened to the control of the 
National Bank, if it is in fact defending the interests of the 
economy of Tatarstan? If the banks are permitted to continue 
this practice, we will be throwing out the baby with the 
bathwater. The conclusion that suggests itself is that credit 
must not be granted against the surety of public assets without 
government permission. 
  It is also obvious today that the government cannot remain 
aloof from financial support for the enterprises of the aviation 
complex and certain others that as of this time have specific 
promising developments and a big future. The government must 
help them overcome the arrears problem, fund the social 
infrastructure, and allocate investment resources for structural 
reorganization and, in particular cases, according to harmonized 
lists, resources from the employment fund for compensation 
payments up to the subsistence level for highly skilled 
specialists who are on administrative leave. 
  There is no doubt that these methods, provided they are 
fulfilled, will make it possible to maintain and enhance 
individuals' living standard. 
  The bill "The Minimum Wage," which provides for employers' 
liability for a failure to comply with the laws of Tatarstan in 
this respect, has been prepared for your attention. 
  The center of gravity of the resolution of social problems 
of 
the transitional period will increasingly shift in the direction 
of the budget and will thereby engender the preconditions for a 
decline in the living standard of the population of the 
republic. The arising vacuum of society's sources of income may 
be filled only by the elaboration of adequate measures of state 
regulation under the conditions of a market economy and state 
support for enterprise. 
  The support of enterprise demands that the state and its 
official representatives gradually withdraw from the spheres of 
economic activity in which the development of the private sector 
is required. In market economics, disagreements on economic 
matters in the fields to which the writ of the state does not 
run should be resolved in legal form. We must have the 
opportunity to rely on the judicial system in the defense of the 
rights of private individuals against encroachments on the part 
of the government. 
  It is essential also to raise the level of pay of employees 
of the justice system, the militia, and the tax authorities, 
such that it be appreciably higher than the wages in other 
fields. Work in these authorities should be held in high regard. 
But there should at the same time be an increase also in their 
responsibility for timely and high-quality treasury receipts and 
for the protection of the interests of society, including the 
fledgling nonstate structures, in accordance with the rules of 
international law. They are called on also to contribute 
actively to the transition of entrepreneurs from the "shadow" 
economy to the legal tax space, with regard to the specific 
features of the transitional period expressed in the discrepancy 
between the old operative laws and the basic principles of the 
market economy. 
  As you know, the state itself is a major employer and 
provides jobs for 286,000 persons, which constitutes 19 percent 
of the total numbers of those in employment in the republic. An 
analysis shows that the average wages in April of the employees 
of health care and social security exceeded by more than R50,000 
the average wage of persons employed in the field of culture, 
art, and research. The living standard of those employed in the 
sphere of culture, art, and research is below the republic 
average. This state of affairs is impermissible. The government, 
as an employer, should in the transitional period provide for an 
average monthly wage not less than the cost of the minimum 
consumer budget. We have simultaneously to devise a mechanism of 
the adaptation of these spheres to market conditions. 
  Thus, the state is directly responsible in the transitional 
period for the living standard of children, veterans, and 
persons on the public payroll--2,316,000 persons altogether--and 
this means 62 percent of the republic's population. This means 
that all the conditions should be created for the remaining 38 
percent of the population of the republic for the application of 
their entrepreneurial activity. And whether they work for 
society or go into the "shadow" economy will depend on the 
rationality of the structure of our tax field. 
  There are two paths of the possible behavior of the state 
aimed at maintaining the living standard of the 
population--passive and active. 
  The first path--passive--is geared to the artificial 
containment of prices and an increase in subsidies in all areas. 
With this approach, the number of persons living below the 
subsistence level will have grown by almost 1.5 million by 
December of this year. This would be a progressive figure, which 
our budget could not sustain. 
  The second path--active--is oriented toward high personal 
income and presupposes the creation for the able-bodied 
population of the conditions for a display of initiative and 
enterprise and a stimulation of the role of the state in 
maintaining an adequate living standard for veterans, children, 
and persons on the public payroll. It is to this path that I 
have, in fact, devoted my speech, for I consider it the sole 
correct one. 
  Thanks to the persevering, dogged labor of the president, 
the 
Supreme Soviet, and the government headed by the prime minister, 
sufficient political potential has been created for the start of 
immediate, dynamic, and fundamental transformations in the 
economy of the republic, and I hope that we will be up to this 
task. 
  Thank you for your attention!

<F P=106> [Press release by the Tatarstan Cabinet of Ministers Press </F>
Center: "To Overcome the Hardship of the Period of Transition"] 
  [Text] As has already been reported, a republic-wide 
conference of the heads of administrations, chairmen of city and 
rayon soviets, leaders of ministries and state committees, 
executives from the president's staff, the Supreme Soviet, and 
the Cabinet of Ministers was held in Kazan on 17 May. The 
conference was opened and chaired by President M.Sh. Shaymiyev. 
  F.R. Gazizullin, deputy prime minister and chairman of the 
Committee for State Property, noted in his presentation that the 
Russian program of mass check-based privatization is nearing 
completion. Out of 3.840 million Russian vouchers distributed to 
the population of our republic, about 2.5 million have been 
used. During the time remaining until 30 June, it is necessary 
to gather from the population the remaining vouchers to be 
canceled and turned in to the National Bank. 
  With a view to accelerating the emergence of a market 
economy 
and ensuring the extensive and involved participation of 
citizens in the process, it is necessary to vigorously use check 
investment funds, ensure the exchange of vouchers into the 
shares of privatized enterprises, and put the chain of stock 
outlets to extensive use. We should also hold auctions to sell 
real estate for tender, including Russian vouchers, speed up the 
conduct of subscriptions to the stock of highly profitable 
enterprises for citizens who do not take part in production 
activities, and issue stock in the process of converting 
enterprises, including municipal, into joint-stock companies. 
  Touching on the distribution of unclaimed vouchers, F.R. 
Gazizullin proposed to distribute them among the least protected 
categories of the population--orphaned children, Categories I 
and II handicapped, and families with many children. 
  Special attention was paid in the presentation to the 
registered privatization deposits (IPV) of the republic. 
  In keeping with a presidential edict, on the whole, the 
IPV's 
will be distributed on a priority basis to the least protected 
strata of the population--handicapped war veterans, Categories I 
and II handicapped, the families of servicemen who perished, 
families with many children, and retirees over 65 years old. 
Issuing them the stock of the most prestigious enterprises has 
already begun. The task was set to complete this work before 1 
June. 
  Between 1 June and 1 September, the IPV's should be traded 
in 
for the shares of prestigious enterprises by all retirees. 
Between 1 September and 1 December, the IPV's for organizations 
financed from the budget should be used, and, from 1 December 
on, the remaining shares will be sold at the nominal price to 
all categories of the population. In the process, the members of 
labor collectives shall use their IPV's in keeping with 
privatization plans and regardless of the above deadlines. 
  Moving on to the problems of small-scale privatization, F.R. 
Gazizullin noted that registered deposits may be used for up to 
90 percent of the sale price of a facility in the case of trade 
sector, public catering, and consumer service enterprises. By 
now, 430 such enterprises have been privatized. In a number of 
rayons (Bavlinskiy, Zainskiy, Zelenodolskiy, and Leninogorskiy), 
the level of small-scale privatization comes to between 70 and 
90 percent. However, in many rayons, this important state 
endeavor has been left to its own devices, or worse yet is 
restricted, especially by trade administrations and 
associations. Unfortunately, the heads of administrations of 
individual cities and rayons and chiefs of ministries and 
departments have taken a wait-and-see attitude. 
  With a view to laying a strong foundation for the completion 
of small-scale privatization in 1994, it is necessary to 
immediately break up and eliminate the existing trade 
administrations, trusts, and associations. It is important to 
sell facilities through competitions (especially investment 
competitions), to keep the selection of products, their 
assortment, physical volume, sales, and so on, and tap as much 
as possible the "hot" money held by entrepreneurial structures, 
that is, implement privatization at a fee. 
  In keeping with the State Program of Privatization, 
enterprises of the trade sector, consumer services, and public 
catering located in the downtown and other prestigious zones of 
cities must be sold primarily at auctions. 
  F.R. Gazizullin noted that, with a view to avoiding 
violations of the law, upholding the legality of privatization, 
and protecting the interests of citizens and the labor 
collectives, all privatization documents must be drawn up in 
keeping with established rules, signed by the chairman of the 
city or rayon committee for the management of municipal 
property, and verified by the Committee for the Management of 
State Property, with a relevant certificate being issued and the 
act of purchase and sale being recorded in the state register of 
Tatarstan. 
  The conference heard a report by Minister of Finance D.N. 
Nagumanov about the status and priority measures to stabilize 
the financial situation in the republic. 
  He said that all our troubles are associated with the 
nonpayment crisis that has broken out in the entire Russian 
Federation. Our main sector--the oil sector--is going through a 
difficult time. Oil-refining enterprises of Russia owe the 
Tatneft more than R400 billion. The financial situation is being 
exacerbated by the continuing slump in production. However, even 
under such circumstances, a lot depends on the standard of 
organizational efforts, inquiry, and overcoming stereotypical 
thinking. There are, after all, enterprises that have good 
economic indicators. These are the associations Teplokontrol, 
Elekon, and Tatkhimfarmpreparaty. 
  D.N. Nagumanov stressed that, in the environment of 
transition to a market economy, the state should support 
enterprises that manufacture easily salable and tax-intensive 
products, which are in demand on the market. At present, these 
are mostly the goods produced by the light and food industries. 
  The extensive implementation of the circulation of bills of 
exchange and guaranteed backing for the bills are another 
important problem. Sharp criticism was leveled in the 
presentation against the managers of a number of enterprises and 
heads of administrations who have substantially increased the 
administrative and management staff, are carried away by the 
acquisition of high-priced equipment and passenger cars, and 
overstate wages and various forms of financial remuneration. The 
chiefs of housing and municipal facilities, health care, and the 
association Tatenergo drew criticism in conjunction with this. 
  The minister has called for the strictest possible economies 
and thrift. Strict accounting and monitoring of the expenditure 
of funds and material resources should be organized. 
  Dwelling on the issues of mutual budgetary relations with 
Russia, D.N. Nagumanov said that they have been completely 
settled at all levels and now there are no obstacles to engaging 
in independent financial and credit activities. Everything 
depends on the involvement of the republic heads of ministries, 
departments, enterprises, and organizations. 
  Minister of Agriculture and Foodstuffs F.S. Sibagatullin 
devoted his presentation to the state of affairs in the republic 
agroindustrial complex and the tasks of its future development. 
He outlined the results of the work of cattle breeders during 
the [first] four months and dwelled on the task of an organized 
transition to the summer pasture management of public-sector 
cattle. 
  The wintering of cattle was not easy. A slump in the 
procurement of animal husbandry products was allowed to occur on 
some republic farms despite an adequate supply of fodder, 
perhaps because of the poor quality of fodder. Added to these 
were organizational shortcomings, and, in some places,. the 
irresponsibility of the chiefs of farms and specialists. The 
herd of cattle is diminishing because of the less intensive 
efforts to reproduce it. It is necessary to restore the herd, to 
reduce the intrafarm consumption of animal husbandry products, 
and to increase meat and milk procurement from the population. 
  Planting in the republic is coming to an end at an optimal 
time; the quality of planting is good. However, in view of the 
fact that less mineral fertilizer has now been applied, as 
compared to last year, a considerable volume of crop cultivation 
work has yet to be done, and a set of measures has to be taken 
to protect the plants against pests, disease, and weeds. 
  F.S. Sibagatullin proceeded to touch on the issues of 
procuring cattle fodder and repairing fodder and 
grain-harvesting machinery. It is necessary to reduce the 
scrapping of machinery to a minimum. 
  As far as reforms in agricultural production are concerned, 
the Edict of the President "On Procedures for the Transformation 
of Kolkhozes and Sovkhozes and Privatization of State 
Enterprises and Organizations of the Agroindustrial Complex of 
the Republic of Tatarstan" is the legal foundation in this 
matter. Collective enterprises, partnerships, joint-stock 
companies, agricultural cooperatives, and peasant farms and 
associations that have already appeared in our republic have 
convincingly proved, through the results of their work, their 
advantages over the obsolete forms of economic operations. By 
now, 200 kolkhozes and sovkhozes have already been transformed, 
and 300 farms have been prepared for this. 
  Further on, the presenter dwelled on the issues of providing 
credit and monetary support to rural areas, putting the use of 
the bills of exchange in order, granting relief to the rural 
producers of goods, regulating procurement prices for the 
products of crop farming and animal husbandry, and reforming the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs and its local 
subdivisions. 
  Chairman of the National Bank Ye.B. Bogachev covered the 
status of the republic banking and finance-and-credit systems 
and priority tasks in stabilizing the situation in this area. 
  In summing up the results of the conference, President M.Sh. 
Shaymiyev described the republic sociopolitical situation. The 
leadership of Tatarstan and local government organs operate 
harmoniously and jointly; there is complete understanding 
between them, stressed M.Sh. Shaymiyev. Referring to the 
historic significance of the treaty between Russia and 
Tatarstan, the president noted that the conviction that it was 
signed at the proper time grows with every passing day. A recent 
meeting with the president of Chuvashia who stated that the path 
traveled by Tatarstan is correct and commands great respect also 
testifies to this. 
  Dwelling on economic problems, M.Sh. Shaymiyev noted that 
the 
economic and cadre potential in our republic makes it possible 
to overcome the hardships of the period of transition rapidly. 
The republic leadership is working on a detailed program for 
further socioeconomic development. In conjunction with this, he 
called on participants in the conference to approach the 
fulfillment of the state privatization program with a full 
measure of responsibility. 
  Among priority tasks, the president mentioned the 
acceleration of settlements with kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and 
enterprises of the agroindustrial complex for delivered 
products, stabilization of remunerations payments to employees 
of institutions and organizations financed from the budget, 
hiring of individuals for management positions on a contractual 
basis, changes in the taxation system, and restoration of order 
in the operation of off-budget funds. Touching on the issue of 
herds of cattle kept on the personal lots of rural residents, 
M.Sh. Shaymiyev stressed that their reduction cannot be allowed 
to occur under any circumstances. It is necessary to provide all 
possible incentives for the growth of the herd of cattle and 
procure milk and meat from the population at fixed rates. 
  In his presentation, the president paid much attention to 
the 
issues of renewal in local self-government. 
  The 50th anniversary of the great victory of the Soviet 
people over fascism is drawing closer, said M.Sh. Shaymiyev in 
summation. This is an unforgettable date, which is particularly 
dear to all of us. It is necessary to begin preparations for the 
50th anniversary right away, without delay, so that every 
resident of Tatarstan, whether young or old, may feel the 
greatness of this victory with his soul and heart and develop 
respect for those who protected the honor and independence of 
their Motherland at the price of incredible efforts, 
self-sacrificing labor, and life itself. 
  Chairman of the Supreme Soviet F.Kh. Mukhametshin, Prime 
Minister M.G. Sabirov, and Vice President V.N. Likhachev took 
part in the conference proceedings.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Kolesnik, people's deputy of the Republic of </F>
Tatarstan, under the rubric "The Deputy's Tribunal": "Mutually 
Advantageous Trade Is the Best Policy"] 
  [Text] I must write about the significance of the Treaty 
between Tatarstan and Russia since its consequences extend not 
only to Tatarstan and Russia. Analysis of it is important, and 
from a purely utilitarian standpoint, so is analysis of the 
practical possibilities for Tatarstan to realize its economic 
sovereignty. Of course these possibilities are not unlimited. On 
the one hand, our own base must be prepared in order to realize 
them. On the other, we must consider what we can really do and 
what is more important to us. I must certainly mention that 
before the Treaty was concluded, our potential to maintain 
foreign ties was very limited. When it was signed, we received a 
legal base, and that is important not only to us but especially 
to partners in contracts. What we can and cannot do in 
accordance with the Treaty in the area of foreign ties is 
precisely what our analysis is devoted to. 
  I must say that in the process of negotiations (and I was a 
participant in them), the Russian side admitted but by no means 
agreed to recognize the possibility of Tatarstan's independent 
foreign-economic activity. But now the Treaty stipulates 
Tatarstan's participation in international relations and the 
opportunity to establish relations with foreign states, conclude 
with them agreements which do not contradict the Constitution 
and international obligations of the Russian Federation, the 
Constitution of the Republic of Tatarstan, or the Treaty, and 
participate in the activity of the appropriate international 
organizations. 
  So, Tatarstan has the right to conclude agreements but not a 
treaty with foreign states, which in fact restricts the range of 
its foreign activity to economics and trade. In addition, these 
agreements, we point out, must not contradict, first, the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, secondly, its 
international obligations, and, finally, the Treaty itself. Such 
an entry is read, first, as "not affecting the sovereignty and 
integrity of the Russian Federation"; second, the sides are 
guided by clearly defined norms fixed in international treaties 
and other agreements of Russia; and third, Tatarstan has the 
right to enter international relations only on questions under 
its jurisdiction. And, in concluding agreements, our republic 
does not have the right to deal with questions of the 
international relations of the Russian Federation as a whole, or 
with questions of war and peace. The last, according to the 
Treaty, is under the jurisdiction of the RF [Russian Federation]. 
  In practice this means that we can conclude primarily 
agreements of an economic character. This is reflected even more 
definitely in the agreement between the governments of Russia 
and Tatarstan on questions of foreign-economic activity. There 
the following are classified as exclusively under our republic's 
jurisdiction: 
  concluding foreign-economic agreements with subjects of 
foreign federations and administrative-territorial formations of 
other countries; 
  concluding trade-economic agreements with foreign states; 
  attracting state, bank, and commercial credits and loans 
guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan Government and 
monitoring their use; 
  forming and monitoring the use of the Republic of 
Tatarstan currency fund; 
  formulating and conducting a policy to attract foreign 
investments to the republic's territory; 
  offering state guarantees to participants in Tatarstan's 
foreign-economic activity; 
  participating in the work of international economic and 
financial organizations and organs; 
  receiving aid from foreign partners and using it; 
  offering credits, loans, and aid to foreign partners; 
  creating free economic zones on the republic's territory. 
  So does the Republic of Tatarstan have the right to 
participate in foreign policy relations? The Treaty does not 
directly restrict this activity and it says that the republic 
"participates in international relations," but only outside the 
limits of the powers of the Russian Federation as a whole. 
  In this way, our republic is considered to have a broad 
range 
of foreign-economic activity. And the sides have apparently 
agreed that the best policy is mutually advantageous trade. But 
to be precise, Tatarstan has been given complete freedom of 
action on its territory under the condition of full 
responsibility for it (guaranteed by the Republic of Tatarstan). 
But foreign policy activity is subordinated to the interests of 
foreign-economic activity and entails a set of questions to be 
resolved jointly with the Russian Federation. In accordance with 
the agreement, the following are included in those questions: 
  protecting Tatarstan's economic interests and its 
enterprises and citizens abroad, which really means Russia's 
representing our republic's interests in the courts or 
arbitration tribunals of third countries; 
  regulating payment-accounts relations with foreign states, 
which indicates the need for Tatarstan to follow the procedure 
for mutual settlement of accounts established by Russia for the 
particular foreign state; 
  establishing a trade-economic regime in relations with 
foreign states and international trade-economic and 
currency-finance organizations--this means jointly establishing 
a regime in trade for countries with which Russia has not 
defined such a regime and following the established regime in 
places where it was defined earlier; 
  licensing Tatarstan's investments abroad, and with joint 
jurisdiction that means Russia's controlling our republic's 
investments. 
  In other words, this means foreign policy on questions of 
economics, finances, and trade handled by Tatarstan jointly with 
the Russian Federation. 
  Overall one can conclude that the provisions of the Treaty 
and corresponding agreement have finally fixed de jure what the 
republic tried to achieve so persistently throughout the entire 
negotiation process. But I must mention that it is hardly wise 
to be content with that. Among other things, it is not clear how 
"coordination of international and foreign-economic ties," which 
is classified among jointly executed powers, is going to be 
carried out. For, as analysis of the Treaty and the agreement 
shows, they do not envision a coordinating mechanism. On its 
territory the Republic of Tatarstan is under its own 
responsibility in executing the entire list of powers, under the 
condition that these actions satisfy the provisions of the 
Treaty and the international obligations of the Russian 
Federation. 
  Or here is another feature. Agreements concluded by 
Tatarstan 
must not contradict the Russian Federation's international 
obligations. Hence, we must know Russia's trade-economic policy 
in detail and systematically study the very respectable volume 
of its trade-economic agreements and treaties. Of course, we do 
not have to do this, but then we are forced to entrust this 
expert study to someone else. This means that in 
foreign-economic activity Tatarstan may prove not to be 
self-sufficient. 
  All this points to the persistent need to formulate a state 
foreign-economic doctrine of Tatarstan which takes into account 
Russia's policy in different regions of the world. Against the 
background of the unstable political interests of the present 
Russian Government, "coordinating" our interests with the 
Russian Federation will not be simple. Everyone knows very well 
that in economics, as in politics, incidentally, not all 
interests coincide. So we are obliged even now to intensively 
prepare cadres of specialists devoted to the republic's 
interests and able to figure out the stratagems of Russia's 
trade agreements and of the economic legislation of the 
countries which are our future partners. We certainly have to 
create a Department of Foreign Relations. The task of studying 
and monitoring Russian foreign-economic policy must be primary 
among the duties of this department.

<F P=106> [Text of decree of the presidium of the Republic of </F>
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet "On the Practice of Applying the 
Republic of Tatarstan Laws on Administrative Responsibility"] 
  [Text] After hearing and discussing the report of the 
minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Tatarstan, I. G. 
Galimov, and the information presented by the procurator of the 
Republic of Tatarstan, S. Kh. Nafiyev, and the chairman of the 
Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Commission on Legality, Law 
and Order, and Human Rights and Privileges, R. G. Vagizov, on 
the practice of applying the Republic of Tatarstan laws on 
administrative responsibility; the presidium of the Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet notes that the Republic of Tatarstan 
laws "On Administrative Responsibility for Violating Public 
Order and Administrative Order," "On Administrative 
Responsibility for Violating the Rules of Traffic, Operation and 
Storage of Transport, and Maintenance of the Road and Street 
System and Technical Means for Organizing Traffic," "On 
Administrative Responsibility for Legal Offenses in the Sphere 
of the Preservation of Property, Monetary Capital, and 
Securities Which Are State or Municipally Owned," and "On 
Administrative Responsibility for Violating the Rules for 
Acquiring, Storing, and Using Firearms and Gas Weapons, 
Ammunition, and Aerosol Packaging" adopted in May 1993 to 
fulfill the State Comprehensive Program To Fight Against Crime 
in the Republic of Tatarstan in 1993-1995, despite the overall 
short effective period, have helped prevent crimes and other 
legal offenses and strengthen legality and law and order. 
  The application of Article 1 of the Republic of Tatarstan 
Law 
"On Administrative Responsibility for Violating Public Order and 
Administrative Order," which establishes administrative 
responsibility for failure, within a month's time, to execute an 
administrative penalty in the form of a fine and its 
substitution with administrative arrest, which helped realize 
the principle of inevitability of punishment and increase 
citizens' responsibility, yielded definite results. 
  When the Republic of Tatarstan Law "On Administrative 
Responsibility for Violating the Rules of Traffic, Operation and 
Storage of Transport, and Maintenance of the Road and Street 
System and Technical Means for Organizing Traffic" went into 
effect on the republic's territory, transport discipline rose 
substantially, the number of road and transport accidents with 
serious consequences stopped rising, and the number of accidents 
due to drivers who were not sober declined. 
  In connection with the adoption of the Republic of Tatarstan 
Law "On Administrative Responsibility for Legal Offenses in the 
Sphere of the Preservation of Property, Monetary Capital, and 
Securities Which Are State or Municipally Owned," the internal 
affairs organs of the Republic of Tatarstan inspected 9,927 
installations for technical reinforcement, alarm systems, and 
preservation of physical assets. 
  The adoption and application of this Law was positively 
reflected in the preservation of physical assets and the 
increased responsibility of managers of enterprises, 
organizations, and institutions. For the first time in the last 
several years, the number of thefts of state property declined 
by 11.2 percent. 
  But the following shortcomings were identified during the 
realization of the Republic of Tatarstan laws: 

  -  the proper application of all these laws and monitoring of 
their performance have not been organized in all cities and 
regions of the republic. Thus, for example, Article 1 of the Law 
"On Administrative Responsibility for Violating Public Order and 
Administrative Order" was poorly utilized in the cities of 
Naberezhnyye Chelny, Zainsk, Leninogorsk, Menzelinsk, and Agryz 
and in Alkeyevskiy, Atninskiy, and Kaybitskiy rayons; 
  -  the impossibility of bringing people to account for failure, 
within a month's time, to fulfill an administrative penalty in 
the form of a fine and its substitution with administrative 
arrest based on other laws, with the exception of the Republic 
of Tatarstan Law "On Administrative Responsibility for Violating 
Public Order"; 
  -  the absence of the possibility of applying less of a 
punishment 
than the lowest level set, which removes the possibility of a 
differentiated approach to administrative offenses and 
accordingly reduces the preventive effect of their use. 


    The Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet presidium 
decrees the following: 
  1. Take under consideration the report of the Republic of 
Tatarstan minister of internal affairs, I. G. Galimov, and the 
information presented by the procurator of the Republic of 
Tatarstan, S. Kh. Nafiyev, and the chairman of the Republic of 
Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Standing Commission on Legality, Law 
and Order, and Human Rights and Privileges, R. G. Vagizov. 
  2. The Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Commission on 
Legality, Law and Order, and Human Rights and Privileges must do 
the following: 

  -  continue work on summarizing the practice of applying the 
Republic of Tatarstan laws on administrative responsibility, and 
report on the results of that work based on 1994 outcomes at a 
meeting of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet presidium; 
  -  submit a draft of the Republic of Tatarstan Code "On 
Administrative Offenses" for the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme 
Soviet presidium to study in the third quarter of 1994, taking 
into account the practice of the application of current 
administrative legislation and the proposals made. 


    3. Make a recommendation to the republic mass information 
media to conduct explanatory work on the laws adopted and on 
coverage of the practice of their application. 
  4. The deputy chairman of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme 
Soviet, A. P. Lozovyy, is charged with monitoring the 
fulfillment of this Decree. 
  Chairman of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet, F. 
Mukhametshin.

<F P=106> [Report by the Republic of Tatarstan Center for Social </F>
Problems under the rubric "Social Monitoring: Month by Month": 
"How We Lived in March: We Continue the Monthly Publications on 
the Standard of Living of Our Republic's Population"] 
  [Text] Recall that the standard of living is assessed by 
the criterion of personal buying power, while the cost of living 
is determined by the system of consumer budgets: the minimum 
living standard and the minimum consumer budget. In accordance 
with the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] Law "On the Minimum Living 
Standard in the Republic of Tatarstan" signed by the president 
of the RT, M. Shaymiyev, on 20 October of last year, the cost 
amount, make-up, and structure of the minimum living standard 
are periodically published in the mass information media. The 
republic's inhabitants should know the cost amount of the 
minimum living standard for the additional reason that according 
to the RT Law "On the Minimum Wage," the minimum amount of labor 
payment cannot be lower than the minimum living standard. 
  So, according to RT Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee] 
data for March, the value of the minimum living standard for 
Tatarstan rose by 11.1 percent (at an absolute value of 3,729 
rubles [R]) and totaled R37,445 as opposed to R33,716 in 
February. And expenditures for food rose by 11 
percent and totaled R28,808 or 76.9 percent in the structure of 
the minimum living standard [MLS] (figure 1 [not reproduced]), 
expenditures for nonproduction goods increased by 16 
percent and totaled R3,420 (9.1 percent), and expenditures for 
personal paid services rose by 7 percent and totaled 
R3,495 (9.33 percent). Analysis of the expenditure headings of 
the minimum living standard shows that in March prices for 
nonfood goods rose at a faster rate (16 percent) than for food 
(11 percent) and for personal paid services (7 percent). 
  The cost of the minimum consumer budget [MCB] in March rose 
by 8.5 percent and totaled R131,984 as opposed to R121,595 in 
February. The structure of expenditures of the MCB: expenditures 
for food--R53,085 (40.2 percent), expenditures for 
nonfood goods--R36,077 (27.3 percent), expenditures 
for personal paid services--R36,750 (27.8 percent), 
and expenditures for taxes and other payments--R6,071 
(4.6 percent). 
  Analysis of the cost of the minimum living standard by 
cities 
and regions of the republic shows that the cities of Kazan 
(R40,324) and Naberezhnyye Chelny (R35,678) continued to be the 
most "expensive" in Tatarstan in March, while the "cheapest" 
were the city of Bugulma (R32,822) and Aksubayevskiy and 
Sabinskiy rayons (R31,437 and R31,516, respectively). 
  Besides the consumer budgets, personal income is also 
classified as a basic social indicator. According to the rough 
estimates of RT Goskomstat, average per capita income for 
Tatarstan in March was R90,100, which is 1.2 times the February 
figure (R74,870). 
  In studying the rate of growth in the cost of the minimum 
living standard and average per capita income during 1993, we 
saw that average income during the year rose by a factor of 9.7, 
while the minimum living standard rose by a factor of 7.3 (see 
RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN of 27 January 1994), that is to say, last 
year the standard of living of the average statistical resident 
of the republic did not decline at least. But if we study the 
year from March 1993 through March 1994, we get a slightly 
different picture. In March of last year, the MLS was R4,500 and 
average per capita income was R11,800, while in March of this 
year the corresponding figures were R37,440 and R90,110. During 
the period from March of last year through March of this year, 
average per capita income rose by a factor of 7.64, while the 
cost of the MLS rose by a factor of 8.32. This means that the 
rise in prices exceeded growth in our income and the standard of 
living began to fall in 1994. 
  Here mistakes made in managing the economy most likely began 
to have an effect. For example, the Government just did not 
manage to "force" the directors of certain enterprises to comply 
with the law on the minimum wage and instead of R30,000 (the 
"minimum" in the RT since February of this year), R14,620 (the 
minimum for the Russian Federation) are paid. This is another 
example: the minimum living standard in March "stretched" to 
R37,400, while the "minimum" is balanced at just R30,000. But we 
have already written that the minimum living standard is the 
line where poverty begins. And that in evaluating the standing 
of living the cost of the minimum consumer budget must be taken 
as the reference point rather than the cost of the minimum 
living standard.

securities, investment funds, and holding companies of the

"The End of Voucher Privatization? What Now?: On the Development 
of a Stock Market and Investment Policy in the RT"] 
  [Text] The end of voucher privatization in Russia and 
accordingly in Tatarstan substantially changes the situation on 
the stock market: a high volume, highly liquid security 
disappears and a large quantity of not very liquid stock of 
privatized enterprises appears. Using the voucher, both the 
stock market and the nonstock market, although they were 
underdeveloped, drew away a large amount of private capital, 
thereby supporting the basic turnover of capital. There were 650 
check investment funds of Russia, a large number of the 
population, and stock structures engaged in exchanging 
securities whose basis was the voucher. 
  Today an enormous task has appeared, the task of developing 
the investment process. The performance of this task is made 
harder by the disastrous drop in production and the inability of 
the state to allocate or increase capital for investments. It is 
obvious that in these conditions investment policy must also be 
changed and its mechanism must be based on the primary and 
mandatory participation of nonstate capital in financing 
investment projects. 
  Changing over from the direct allocation of state 
investments 
on a centralized and outright basis to distribution of these 
resources on the principles of payback and income-production in 
the form of state guarantees for particular investors and 
particular investment projects can be proposed as one of the 
ways to accomplish the above. 
  According to the predictions of analysts, a situation of 
free-falling crisis and investment stoppage in its classic 
variant (United States, 1929) may occur in Russia by fall. 
  A solution to the situation which has taken shape, starting 
up the investment process with minimal state participation and 
creating a system of state guarantees, is possible on the basis 
of stock market instruments using market methods for attracting 
additional capital of private investors (including the 
population). In creating and developing a liquid securities 
market as a most important regulator of investment processes in 
a market economy, we initiate an influx of private investments 
guaranteed by the state in the form of securities. 
  A packet of documents on this mechanism needs to be 
formulated. The essence of them can be reduced to the following: 
the state interested in developing priority sectors invests in a 
project. The emissions body issues its stock and transfers to 
the government (in the person of the agent) a block of stock in 
exchange for investments, but with the guarantee to subsequently 
buy it back at a price, say, indexed in relation to the dollar's 
rate at the moment the transaction is registered. In addition, 
transferable bills in the amount of the state's annual interest 
rate set for investment credit are transferred. A transferable 
bill is written out for every year. 
  The state transfers this block of securities in trust to the 
government's agent, in doing so delegating the state guarantees 
to him. The trust agreement stipulates that the securities be 
distributed among private investors, including the population. 
  The agent structure accepts the state securities on its 
balance and issues its own bonds which ensure the attraction of 
additional investments of private investors and the full return 
of the capital to the state. 
  It is obvious that the government's agent can be either a 
state or a nonstate structure with which a trust contract has 
been concluded. These structures are needed to attract the 
capital of the population, nonstate pension funds, socially 
oriented funds, and so forth. They reduce the risk of long-term 
investments for them given an unstable economic situation. 
Nonstate agents issue their bonds either in the form of 
mandatory payment of fixed dividends, or the issuance of 
securities at a specific fixed rate after a particular time, or, 
finally, in the form of the purchase and sale of securities on 
investment projects with the state's share participation. 
  In this way, the risk is redistributed and the interests of 
the participants in ensuring the success of the investment 
project (AVVA, for example) are combined. 
  The government's agent, a general investment fund, is 
interested in the quick return of state capital, since this 
raises its income on securities expressed as long-term bonds, 
which stimulates investment activity. In this way, the general 
investment fund can operate on a fundamentally new level of 
participation in the investment process: not only as a guarantor 
but as an active investor with an interest in a higher exchange 
value of the securities, that is to say, in the long-term 
development of enterprises. The return of investments to the 
state and accelerated turnover of investment capital are 
ensured, substantial amounts of capital of private investors can 
be attracted in a short period of time, and state capital is 
released to turn over again. 
  The best prepared nonstate agent structure today is the 
system of investment funds which has taken shape (there are 16 
of them in our republic). They are the ones who are able in a 
short time to change from an apparatus for accumulating and 
redistributing checks and IPV's [personal privatization 
deposits] into a mechanism for efficient redistribution of real 
capital. We already have large and stable funds: the National 
Fund, the Zolotoy kolos [Golden Grain] Fund, the Obrazovaniye 
[Education] Fund, and the Doveriye [Trust] Fund, which are the 
largest holders of stock of privatized enterprises. 
  They integrate their capital and could act as specialized 
institutions to realize state investment policy in the republic. 
Especially since the funds must be integrated to join the 
all-Russian and world securities markets. 
  The end of voucher privatization does not rule out the 
continued operation of check funds. According to the Statute on 
Investment Funds, they may not be liquidated as check funds for 
3 years, especially since in our republic they must continue to 
work vigorously until the effective period of the IPV's is up. 
But at the same time, new trends in the development of check 
funds have been noted, taking into account the coming crisis of 
the stock market, the threat of bankruptcy, and the need to 
accept the new forms of work which have become established in 
world practice. 
  Some funds specialize in creating a universal diversified 
portfolio (stock, deposits, and short-term investments). Another 
group is oriented to long-term investments and "know-how" and is 
reviving sectorial directions of investments. Finally, a 
considerable number of funds will merge or change their status. 
The funds appear to be ready for transformation into investment 
companies, investment banks, affiliates, and branches of 
investment banks and are being transformed or are creating 
investment funds with deferred payments related to pension and 
insurance support, payment for the future education of children, 
and savings for building housing. 
  It would be right to support this aspiration of theirs and 
use them as the basis to create the necessary structure of 
agents of the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan. 
  This must also be done in order to prevent a social 
explosion: the crisis of organizations which have hundreds of 
thousands of stockholders among the population as their 
investors puts responsibility on the state for their stability 
and the reorganization of funds; therefore their activity should 
be put on a civilized track. 
  Continued state support of check funds is needed, fund 
departments must be created in every joint stock company, and 
support in developing the whole stock market in Tatarstan and 
Russia must be provided. 
  The All-Russian Fifth Conference of Check Funds held 
recently 
in Izhevsk, where the problems of post-voucher privatization 
were discussed, confirmed that our position in regard to state 
support and the creation of better conditions for the activity 
of check funds on the republic's territory was right. 
  The first annual meetings of stockholders of check funds 
showed that funds like the following are most trusted among the 
population and have the greatest potential to pay the largest 
dividends: Zolotoy kolos (400 percent annually), the National 
Fund (250 percent annually), Obrazovaniye (210 percent 
annually), APK-Invest [Agroindustrial Complex-Invest] (200 
percent annually), and Doveriye (200 percent annually). 
  We understand that the least protected categories of the 
population (pensioners, disabled persons, budget sphere 
employees, and employees of the military-industrial complex, 
public organizations, and other enterprises which are not to be 
privatized) are the stockholders of check funds. The issuance of 
some of the stock of privatized enterprises to stockholders of 
check funds at face value and their exemption from tax on 
profits and dividends, even for just the first 2 years (or until 
the effective period of the IPV's runs out), will be the minimum 
support needed for this group of the population. 
  Funds must allow transactions practiced in the West and 
remove the enormous number of restrictions. This was also 
discussed at the all-Russian seminar. Among other things, the 
use of debt obligations must be permitted. For example, the 
bills of exchange ["veksel"] of Tveruniversalbank [Tver 
Universal Bank] suggest that such a category of securities is 
promising. The opportunity to buy back one's own stock must be 
granted and there must be the possibility of changing into other 
investment forms, merging must be promoted, and the most 
important thing, the offices of check funds must be extensively 
used in the councils of directors of joint stock companies. The 
egoism of labor collectives must be overcome and private capital 
and the development of a civilized stock market and a secondary 
securities market must be set in motion. 
  The first results of the work of the National Investment 
Fund, which has more than 5 billion rubles in assets and 
integrates capital of other funds under conditions of 
consolidation, shows that we have the potential for 
entrepreneurship. Today the National and a group of other funds 
have created an investment bank and a nonstate pension fund and 
have formulated a number of interesting, socially oriented 
investment projects and are forming an insurance company. All 
this increases the turnover and stability of personal 
investments. 
  The question of protecting the rights of all stockholders 
and 
insuring their investments is becoming most important. In our 
republic we have not had cases such as those involving 
Tekhnicheskiy progress [Technical Progress], Privat-Invest 
[Private Invest], and Neft-Almaz-Invest [Oil and Diamonds 
Invest], but that does not mean that we should lessen control in 
this direction. It is also important to create conditions to 
lessen the difficulty of transactions with securities in the 
work of check funds. So, we will support check funds, but we are 
for tougher control over the capital of the collective investor, 
the stockholders of the funds.

throughout the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan with 
regard to privatization of housing in state-owned and 
municipally-owned housing holdings, terms for the payment of 
compensation in the form of an additional amount of individual 
privatization deposits to citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan 
who have substandard living conditions, as well as the 
fundamental principles for payment of expenditures for the 
maintenance and repair of housing that has undergone 
privatization. 
  2. The fundamental principles governing privatization of 
state-owned and municipally-owned housing are: 
  -- acceptance of housing ownership on a voluntary basis; 
  -- free transfer to citizens of housing occupied by them in 
state-owned (or municipally-owned) housing units, regardless of 
the total amount of living space or the commercial value of the 
housing; 
  -- preservation of the key elements of the previous system 
for the use, repair and maintenance of privatized housing; 
  -- payment of compensation in the form of an additional 
amount of individual privatization deposits to citizens of the 
Republic of Tatarstan who do not have housing or have housing 
conditions that are below the average level achieved in this

regardless of the form of housing ownership. 
  Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in housing 
that is not slated for privatization or who has living 
conditions below the average level of housing provision in the 
republic (16.2 sq. meters per capita) has a right to receive 
compensation in the form of additional means of payment, usable 
for purposes of privatization. 
  A citizen has the right to receive compensation once, 
regardless of the form of ownership of the housing occupied by 
that citizen. 
  Compensation will be provided in the following amounts: 
  -- for citizens without housing (renters in privately-owned 
buildings and buildings belonging to housing construction 
cooperatives; persons subletting in state-owned and communal 
housing with no other residence permit): R40,000 [rubles] in 
individual privatization accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens without housing who are living in specialized 
buildings (in buildings belonging to the Republic of Tatarstan 
Ministry of Social Security, the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry 
of Health or the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, and who have no permanent residence permit outside 
those institutions): R40,000 in individual privatization 
accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens with no housing who are living in dormitories 
(with the exception of seasonal and temporary workers and 
individuals working under temporary contracts, as well as 
citizens who are resident in connection with study): R40,000 
rubles in individual privatization accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens living in housing classified (according to 
legally established procedure) as hazardous and dilapidated: 
R40,000 in individual privatization accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens living in closed military settlements and in 
official housing: R30,000 in individual privatization accounts 
(deposits); 
  -- citizens with less than 5 sq. meters of living space 
(inclusive) per person: R30,000 in individual privatization 
accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens with between 5 and 10 sq. meters of living space 
(inclusive) per person: R20,000 in individual privatization 
accounts (deposits); 
  -- citizens with between 10 and 16.2 sq. meters of living 
space (inclusive) per person: R10,000 in individual 
privatization accounts (deposits). 
  Every citizen of the Republic of Tatarstan living in a 
building belonging to a housing construction cooperative has a 
right to receive compensation in the form of additional 
privatization payments in the amount of R10,000 in individual 
privatization accounts (deposits). 
  3. The right to privatization of housing in state-owned and 
municipally-owned buildings belongs to the citizens who are 
permanently registered in those buildings, including citizens 
who are temporarily absent but have retained a legal right to 
the housing in question. 
  Citizens who have reserved housing have a right to the 
privatization of housing at their place of reservation. 
  4. Housing may be privatized only with the written consent 
of 
all the adult citizens living in the housing in question. 
Privatized housing becomes the joint property of all the 
citizens living in it, including minors. 
  Minor citizens must be listed among housing owners. 
  In the event that citizens move to other state-owned (or 
municipally-owned) housing for the purpose of improving their 
living conditions in accordance with current legislation and 
have taken up residence in that housing on the basis of a lease, 
the citizens in question have a right to privatization of the 
housing previously occupied by them. 
  A housing privatization contract may be dissolved with the 
mutual consent of the parties to the contract, or in the event 
of a dispute, by a court on the basis of a suit filed by one of 
the parties. 
  Any citizen who dissolves a housing privatization act 
through 
legally established procedure retains the right to free 
privatization of the housing in a state-owned (or 
municipally-owned) building which that citizen occupies under 
the terms of a housing lease. 
  5. Housing units in buildings in need of capital repairs are 
to be privatized on the usual terms. 
  6. Housing which is in a hazardous state or is located in 
dormitories, specialized buildings or in buildings at closed 
military settlements may not be privatized. 
  Local soviets of people's deputies, in conjunction with 
enterprises, institutions and organizations and with 
consideration for the opinion of trade unions (as expressed by 
appropriate bodies thereof) or, in the absence of such, the 
opinion of workers' direct representatives who have been 
properly elected and authorized in accordance with the laws of 
the Republic of Tatarstan, shall determine the portion (list) of 
official housing that is not subject to privatization. 
  Privatization of housing (apartments) in buildings which are 
historical or cultural monuments must be carried out in 
accordance with the "Statute on Procedure and Terms for 
Privatization of Buildings Which Are Historical or Cultural 
Monuments." 
  7. Housing in communal apartments may be privatized with the 
consent of all tenants. In such cases rooms occupied by tenants 
become the property of their residents, but kitchens, hallways, 
bathrooms, etc. remain common property. 
  8. As a rule, interviews with citizens and the preparation 
and issuance of documents establishing property rights are to be 
carried out by housing maintenance enterprises and their 
subordinate units (susequently to be referred to as HMEs), 
ministerial (departmental) enterprises, organizations and 
institutions which have state-owned housing on their books, and 
HMEs under local soviets of people's deputies which own 
municipal housing. 
  Special centers (agencies, bureaus) for the privatization of 
state-owned and municipally-owned housing may be established to 
perform work connected with document processing relative to 
housing privatization in cities (or rayons). 
  9. Local soviets of people's deputies shall establish 
regional commissions to oversee and organize housing 
privatization processes. 
  A housing privatization commission operates pursuant to the 
"Statute on Commissions for the Privatization of State and 
Municipal Housing," as approved by the Republic of Tatarstan 
State Committee for State Property Management. 
  10. During the preparatory period, i.e. prior to enactment 
of 
the law, HME specialists shall fill out a draft "Contract on the 
Transfer of Housing to Citizens" for each housing unit that may 
be privatized. 
  This draft contract is to be signed and registered by the 
head of the city (or rayon) administration, and also be 
registered with technical inventory agencies. 
  Upon completion of this preparatory work, HMEs shall inform 
each area's population of the business hours and location of the 
office that will conduct interviews with citizens. 
  11. Citizens must submit to the appropriate HME an 
application for privatization of a housing unit signed by all 
the adult citizens who live together in that unit. 
  In view of the fact that every citizen has a right to 
acquire 
a housing unit in a state- or municipally-owned building free of 
charge as part of the privatization process only one time, in 
the event of changes of residence a document must be attached to 
the application certifying that the housing unit previously 
occupied by the citizens in question has not been privatized. 
  12. A specialist will verify the correctness of the 
application form and correlate the information inidicated 
therein with corresponding information contained in the 
previously prepared draft contract. If no comments are to be 
made, one copy of the completed contract will be issued to the 
applicant. A second copy of the contract will remain with the 
HME, and a third will be sent to technical inventory agencies so 
that they can maintain state-mandated records of housing 
according to established procedure. 
  13. In cases of discrepancies between information provided 
by 
the applicant and information contained in the draft contract, 
documents pertaining to privatization of the housing unit in 
question shall be handed over to a regional commission for 
consideration and resolution. In such cases decisions on housing 
privatization matters must be made not later than one month from 
the date the documents are submitted to the HME. 
  14. Payments for processing of documents pertaining to the 
transfer of housing ownership will be made by citizens at a 
single rate equal to 0.4 times the minimum wage. 
  15. In the event that a citizen's rights are violated in 
connection with housing privatization matters, that citizen has 
a right to appeal to a housing privatization commission or to a 
court. 
  16. Rules for record keeping regarding citizens, including 
those living in privatized housing units who require improvement 
of their living conditions, as well as assignment of housing 
units in the Republic of Tatarstan, shall be governed by current 
legislation. 
  17. Owners of privatized housing units in buildings that are 
state-owned or municipally-owned constitute building users with 
regard to physical plant and common areas, and owners joined 
together in societies or other associations constitute co-owners 
in proportion to the area of the building occupied by them. 
  18. Maintenance and repair of privatized housing units 
(apartments), buildings which contain privatized housing units 
(apartments), and entirely privatized residential buildings are 
to be performed in compliance with existing regulations and 
standards governing housing use and repair. 
  19. State HMEs retain their obligations with regard to the 
maintenance and ongoing and capital repairs of privatized 
housing units (apartments) and buildings containing privatized 
housing units (apartments) which were serviced by them prior to 
the start of privatization. 
  20. Owners of housing units (apartments) in a multi-unit 
apartment building are required to share common expenditures for 
the maintenance and repair of the structure (residential 
building), its physical plant and areas adjacent to the building 
in accordance with the "Contract on Transfer of a Housing Unit 
to Citizen Ownership." 
  21. For the purpose of efficient maintenance, servicing and 
repair of privatized housing, owners may form societies or other 
associations operating on the basis of bylaws. 
  22. Prior to the formation of a society of apartment owners 
(co-owners of a building), relations between apartment owners 
and the HME that administers the multi-unit apartment building 
in question with regard to servicing and repair of the building, 
adjacent areas and privatized apartments shall be based on a 
contract covering services to the building, adjacent areas and 
privatized apartments. 
  Under that contract the HME pledges to perform a number of 
jobs in connection with the maintenance and ongoing and capital 
repair of the building and adjacent areas in accordance with the 
requirements of the "Regulations for Housing Use and Maintenance 
of Housing and Adjoining Areas" on the terms specified for 
state-owned and municipally-owned housing, and also: 
  -- conduct preventive inspections of plumbing fixtures in 
apartments twice annually; 
  -- repair plumbing fixtures at the request of the apartment 
owner using the owner's materials or in exchange for additional 
payment, if the HME supplies materials. 
  The property owner is required to make monthly payments for 
the HME's services and for municipal services equivalent to the 
payments (rent and payment for municipal services) as 
established for renters in state-owned and municipally-owned 
housing. 
  A schedule of monthly payments for building maintenance, 
municipal services and other services to the apartment owner 
must be attached to the contract. 
  23. Owners of privatized housing units are required to pay a 
tax in accordance with current tax legislation. 
  24. A society of apartment owners is a co-owner of a 
multi-unit apartment building, and the terms of this 
co-ownership must be set forth in a "Contract on Joint Ownership 
of Housing and Share Participation in Its Maintenance." 
  The entity on the balance sheet of which the building is 
listed and other legal persons that are co-owners of the 
building are required to conclude the aforementioned contract. 
  25. When concluding a "Contract on Joint Ownership of 
Housing 
and Share Participation in Its Maintenance" an HME may, by 
decision of the building's co-owners, delegate to the society a 
portion of its rights and obligations with regard to maintenance 
and repair of the building and adjoining areas. 
  The society may act as customer when contracts are concluded 
with contractors for municipal services, ensure participation in 
all expenditures connected with property maintenance and repair 
commensurate to each co-owner's share of ownership, ensure 
timely payment of funds set aside for those purposes, represent 
the co-owners' interests before state and other institutions, 
etc. 
  26. After all the apartments in a multi-unit apartment 
building have been privatized, the apartment building, with the 
exception of attached or adjoining non-dwelling structures, may 
be transferred to the ownership of the citizens who have joined 
together to form a society. Only in that case may the building 
be transferred from the balance sheet of the HME to that of the 
society. 
  Transfer of ownership of an apartment building is to be 
performed by the entity on the balance sheet of which the 
building is listed by agreement with the owner or a body 
authorized by the owner, in accordance with current legislation. 
  27. Relations between the client -- the society of apartment 
owners -- and the contractor -- the HME or other organization 
that repairs or maintains the building and adjoining areas -- 
are to be established on a contractual basis. 
  28. Communications networks inside apartments, physical 
plant 
and other facilities are not subject to privatization. 
  29. The owners of privatized housing units are responsible 
for their maintenance and repair in accordance with current 
legislation. 
  30. Monitoring of the condition and timely repair of 
privatized housing is to be carried out by local soviets of 
people's deputies.

<F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Nedashkovskaya: "Russian-Chechen Talks </F>
on the Way to Harmony"] 
  [Text] The "Chechen revolution" three years ago was the 
result of the struggle of the Russian and USSR centers for 
mastery in the Russian home. Considering the present desire of 
Russian politicians to achieve harmony on the territory of the 
entire Federation, it makes sense recalling the events of those 
revolutionary days. 
  In 1991, the official elite of the Russian autonomies (and 
Doku Zavgayev, leader of Checheno-Ingushetia, was no exception) 
supported the USSR center in exchange for the right to sign the 
USSR Treaty. The national movements of the autonomies, on the 
other hand, supported the Russian democrats headed by the chief 
fighter against party privileges--Boris Yeltsin. The chairman of 
the Russian parliament reciprocated the support of the national 
leaders: it was the Russian parliament that in June 1991 sent a 
telegram of greetings to the National Congress of the Chechen 
People (NCCP), which had by that time proclaimed the sovereignty 
of the Chechen Republic of Nokhchi-cho and announced the 
republic Supreme Soviet's loss of its legitimacy. 
  The official leadership of Checheno-Ingushetia reacted to 
the 
August putsch in the same way as the leaders of the majority of 
administrative and national-state units of the ex-USSR, that is, 
remained in session for three days. The National Congress of the 
Chechen People, like the informal movements in other regions, 
organized a demonstration in Groznyy's main square and then 
demanded that the "continuous-session" Supreme Soviet be 
dispersed. By that time, the NCCP was supported by thousands of 
unemployed persons (merely according to official figures, there 
were approximately 100,000 of these in the republic) and 
representatives of the "shadow economy" hoping with the help of 
Dudayev's group to squeeze out the clan of Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Doku Zavgayev from the main sources of revenue (oil) 
and take control of these sources themselves. 
<H5>  Some Things From Recent History </H5>
  Representatives of the Russian leadership--General Aslanbek 
Aslakhanov, member of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet Presidium, and 
Inga Grebesheva, deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of 
Ministers--warned Zavgayev at the emergency session of the 
Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet Presidium of the 
impermissibility of the use of force for breaking up the 
demonstration and the national guard of the NCCP demanding 
parliament's resignation. Especially since at that moment 
General Dudayev was declaring that "only the laws of the Russian 
Federation are valid on the territory of the Chechen Republic of 
Nokhchi-cho." 
  The Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet resigned, and 
guardsmen of the NCCP broke up the parliamentary presidium 
following an assault on the House of Political Education on 3 
September 1991. Power in Groznyy passed to the NCCP Executive 
Committee. Russian politicians made an attempt to take control 
of the situation in Groznyy. State Secretary Gennadiy Burbulis, 
Information Minister Mikhail Poltoranin, RSFSR Supreme Soviet 
Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov, and Vice President Aleksandr 
Rutskoy flew to Groznyy for this purpose. But, the Russian 
authorities' attempt to form a provisional supreme council made 
up of deputies of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet and 
Checheno-Ingushetia and political organizations ended in 
failure: Hurt by the role of extra, the Congress of the Chechen 
Peoples Executive Committee broke up also in the early hours of 
8 October the Supreme Council that had been consecrated by the 
supreme Russian authorities. 
  The Russian leadership's subsequent attempts to intervene in 
the "Chechen revolution" led to Groznyy's isolation from Moscow, 
the general mobilization of the male population, and the 
declaration of a "holy war" against Russia. The elections of 
President Dzhokhar Dudayev and the parliament of the Chechen 
Republic were held on 27 October, and independence was 
proclaimed on 2 November. 
  A decisive role in Dudayev's victory was performed by the 
Russian presidential edict on the imposition of a state of 
emergency in Checheno-Ingushetia of 8 November 1991: The 
opposition, which had opposed Dudayev's usurpation of power and 
had divided the republic, was forced to remove its demands and 
go underground. The cancellation of Boris Yeltsin's edict two 
days later could not by this time have changed anything: The 
arms stores had been ransacked, and the population was armed. 
The Chechen and Russian leaderships said scurrilous things about 
one another, but in January 1992 still embarked on long and 
absolutely fruitless negotiations on the status of Chechnya. 
<H5>  Dzhokhar Dudayev and His Opposition </H5>
  The opposition to Dudayev is diverse: The political and 
economic interests of various opposition groups and parties are 
interwoven with clan inequality and territorial demarcations. 
  The first opposition to Dudayev arose back in the 
"pre-revolution" times, when some of the new politicians headed 
by Lechi Umkhayev, unhappy with the radicalism of Chairman 
Dzhokhar Dudayev, who had originally been assigned the role of 
"wedding general" in the NCCP, walked out of the National 
Congress of the Chechen People. 
  The next opposition--the Democratic Reform Movement, the 
Movement for a United Checheno-Ingushetia--was formed at the 
time of the "Chechen revolution" and consisted of parties and 
movements unhappy with the usurpation of power on the part of 
the NCCP. But the "political" opposition was small and did not 
constitute a threat to Dudayev's power even at that time. 
  The territorial opposition, which has as of this time 
embraced the valley areas, arose primarily in Nadterechnyy 
Rayon, the birthplace of Doku Zavgayev, the ousted chairman of 
the Checheno-Ingushetia Supreme Soviet. The mayor of this rayon, 
Umar Avturkhanov, heads an opposition that calls itself 
"constructive" and lays claim to a particular role in the 
Russian-Chechen negotiations. 
  The next opposition group--that of Yaraga Mamodayev, "vice 
premier of the first Dudayev intake"--arose in the spring of 
1993. As local observers believe, the main motive for 
Mamodayev's move into the opposition was the loss of control of 
the trade in petroleum products. The rift between the prime 
minister (Dudayev) and vice prime minister (Mamodayev) signified 
the formation of a territorial opposition in Urus-Martanovskiy 
Rayon also, in which the leading parts are being played by 
representatives of the Chankhaya Clan (to which Mamodayev 
belongs). 
  The political crisis in Chechnya and the growth of 
corruption 
led to the "political" opposition's demand for a limitation of 
Dudayev's power being supported by both parliament and the 
Constitutional Court. But, the lesson of neutralization of the 
opposition with the aid of an external threat had been well 
assimilated by Dudayev back in 1991: The struggle against the 
opposition has invariably been conducted to the accompaniment of 
the imposition of a state of emergency in order to defend the 
fatherland against Russian encroachments. Parliament, the 
Groznyy Municipal Assembly, and the Constitutional Court were 
broken up in May-June 1993, and criminal proceedings were 
instituted against parliament in January 1994 "for having 
undermined the sovereignty of the republic." 
  But, despite everything, General Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
positions 
are quite stable in Groznyy. This is connected not only with the 
fragmented nature of the various opposition groups but also with 
the lack of a common policy in respect to the "former Russian 
colony" on the part of the Russian political establishment. 
<H5>  Elections Optional? </H5>
  The general's enemies in Chechnya, and in the Caucasus also, 
explain the president's stable positions by the fact that the 
republic long since became a joint venture of the president of 
Chechnya and certain Russian generals in the sale of weapons to 
"flash points." And, cited as proof of this version is the 
geography of the general-president's unimpeded trips--Bosnia, 
Libya, Somalia.... And the absence of the signing of any 
documents enshrining the republic's new status. 
  Negotiations between the Russian leadership and Chechnya 
have 
been under way since 1992, for that matter. Both sides have in 
fact deemed these negotiations to be illegal. First, Chechnya 
broke up parliament, accusing it of collaboration with Russia, 
and then Russia's deputies this March adopted decrees of the 
State Duma and the Federation Council "A Political Settlement of 
Relations of the Federal Authorities and the Authorities of the 
Chechen Republic," which, according to Shakhray, were essential 
for overcoming the legal vacuum after General Dudayev's regime 
had at the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR been 
deemed illegal. 
  The documents adopted by the Russian leadership were based 
on 
the "Shakhray concept." They provide for consultations with all 
political forces of Chechnya and the signing of a treaty on the 
mutual delegation of authority following "free elections to the 
organs of power of Chechnya and to the Russian Federation 
Federal Assembly." This wording suits that part of the Chechen 
opposition that calls itself "constructive" (Avturkhanov's 
group). But such a concept is not to the liking of another part 
of the opposition or Groznyy officialdom. 
  First, because the Chechen authorities do not consider the 
republic a component of Russia and Sergey Filatov, leader of the 
Executive Office of the Russian Federation President, had 
already let slip in an interview with Radio Ekho Moskvy that he 
regarded Chechnya as a republic within the Russian Federation. 
Second, because the Chechen leadership is unwilling to conduct 
multilateral negotiations with the participation not only of the 
"constructive" but also other oppositions to Dudayev. 
<H5>  Switching Off the Electricity--Telling Argument </H5>
  On the other hand, Groznyy officialdom has as of this time 
no 
other way but Russian-Chechen negotiations. The republic is on 
the verge of a social explosion: Wages at the oil fields have 
not been paid since last October; and, on 12 April, according to 
an Interfax report, power in the republic was switched off for 
the nonpayment of arrears--approximately R20 billion. Even the 
traditional deployment along the republic's borders "on the 
threshold of an emergency situation" was no help under these 
conditions. 
  With the switching off of electricity on 12 April, the 
vocabulary and tone of the highest echelon of the Chechen 
Republic changed. In an interview with INTERFAX, Dzhokhar 
Dudayev agreed with the position of the current Russian 
establishment: "The sole way out of the current imbalance of 
forces in the world is a revival of the defense might of the CIS 
and the sovereign status of Russia." The ideologist of the 
"Chechen revolution" and Movladi Udugov, Chechen minister of 
information, cited as the most acceptable position of Russia for 
them that of Valeriy Fateyev, Russian deputy minister of 
economics, who called for recognition of the legitimacy of 
President Dudayev and termed the attempts to make the question 
of the signing of a treaty dependent on elections in Chechnya 
the "imperial policy syndrome." 
  But, Valeriy Fateyev's words can hardly be considered 
decisive, and there is also opposition to this approach not only 
in Chechnya but in Russia also. But, in any event, Russia and 
Chechnya are condemned to seek an accord. Especially since this 
course has today been proclaimed official doctrine in Russia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yusup Soslambekov by Olga Vasilyeva; place </F>
and date not given: "Dudayev's Positions Are Stable"] 
  [Text] Yusup Soslembekov is a former deputy of 
Dzhokhar Dudayev on the National Congress of the Chechen Peoples 
Executive Committee. During the attempted suppression of the 
"Chechen revolution" by force on the part of Moscow, he was 
acting defense minister. In December 1992, he switched to 
opposition to President Dzhokhar Dudayev. Like many leaders of 
the Chechen opposition, he currently lives outside the 
republic. 
  [Vasilyeva] Could you assess the stability of President 
Dudayev's positions? 
  [Soslambekov] Neither the opposition nor Dudayev controls 
the 
situation throughout the republic. But the situation is similar 
in all the new CIS states, and this argument could not, most 
likely, serve as a criterion of a leader's stability. 
  I would assess Dudayev's position in Chechnya as being very 
stable. Support for the opposition on the part of society is 
greatly exaggerated: Umar Avturkhanov, for example, a leader of 
the opposition, does not have unconditional support even in 
Nadterechnyy Rayon, where he is mayor. Support for Avturkhanov 
by other rayons in opposition to President 
Dudayev--Urus-Martanovskiy, Gudermeskiy, Sherinskiy, the rural 
Groznenskiy (although it is a long time since this rayon 
existed), and Vedenskiy--is altogether out of the question. I am 
sure that the idea of the formation of a provisional committee 
of opposition rayons was "tossed" to Avturkhanov: Russian 
politicians need some trump card for pressure on Dudayev. This 
idea will enable Russian leaders to negotiate with an actual 
opposition, but the legitimacy of the provisional committee is 
greatly in doubt. 
  Political methods of struggle against the Dudayev regime are 
today exhausted, nor is there a force capable of removing it 
from power and restoring the constitutional system in Chechnya. 
Those who believe that the Chechnya issue may be settled by 
force within 24 hours are mistaken. With the modern types of 
arms, a conflict cannot be settled by numerical superiority. 
Practically all conflicts that we are observing currently in 
Bosnia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ossetia, Iraq, or Somalia are 
insoluble. There will be no military victory at the current 
stage. 
  [Vasilyeva] Let us, nonetheless, imagine a situation where 
Russia has decided to plant a governor general in 
Groznyy--Zavgayev or Khasbulatov, for example. What would happen? 
  [Soslambekov] As far as Khasbulatov is concerned, Russian 
politicians would hardly be longing to see him even in Chechnya: 
Khasbulatov is a delayed-action mine for Russia. In terms of 
scale, Chechnya is one administrative district of Moscow. But 
Chechnya in Khasbulatov's hands would signify the destruction of 
modern Russia: Khasbulatov could quickly establish interaction 
with the leaders of the North Caucasus republics, with the 
Cossacks. And this is the south of Russia, which has 
historically opposed the center. 
  As far as Zavgayev is concerned, his imposition by force on 
Moscow's part would not signify peace in Chechnya: It is 
sufficient to recall how he was removed in the fall of 1991. He 
or Avturkhanov would be supported only by Nadterechnyy Rayon. 
Besides, the Russian leadership has no interest in the removal 
of Dudayev. 
  [Vasilyeva] Why? 
  [Soslambekov] There is no one with whom to replace him: it 
is 
impossible to find a person capable of controlling the situation 
in Chechnya and at the same time to abide by the policy of 
present-day Russia.

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Gorodetskaya, reporting from Groznyy: </F>
"Chechnya Decides To Establish World Islamic Center: Peoples of 
the Northern Caucasus Urged To Unite Against Russian Genocide"] 
  [Text] The report that Groznyy was to be the site of an 
international seminar entitled "Genocide in the USSR: Ideology, 
Policy and Practice" put nationalistically inclined segments of 
the public into ecstasy -- no events on this scale have been 
held in Chechnya since the "Revolution of 1991." According to 
eyewitnesses, when the director of one of the best health 
resorts in the republic told his staff that the seminar 
participants would be staying there, many of the staff cried for 
joy. The patients, upon hearing the news, "themselves packed 
their belongings and went home, saying that they would finish 
their treatment later, and many of them were crying for joy and 
praying" (only the most seriously ill stayed). The guests, who 
despite the fears of the organizing committee came not only from 
the Northern Caucasus republics but also from the United States, 
Syria, Kazakhstan, the Crimea, Moscow and Lithuania, were 
received with hospitality that exceeded the wildest 
expectations. On the first evening the road-weary visitors were 
placed in mud baths, sulfur baths and other therapeutic baths, 
anyone who wanted got a special water massage, and then all were 
given showered with food and drink. Furthermore, as later became 
known, it was not just female attendants and nurses who 
smilingly carried away dirty plates and glasses and attended to 
the guests' every whim, but also an anesthesiologist, surgeons 
and even the head of the surgical department. The visitors were 
somewhat confused to see the pistols hanging from the belts of 
the health resort's director and several conference 
participants, something that was particularly noticeable when 
they were dancing the lezginka with their jackets 
off, as well as automatic weapons in the hands of numerous young 
people, both in uniform and in civilian clothing. However, local 
residents assured them that "this was the custom" and that the 
young people were presidential guards assigned to protect the 
guests. It should be noted that the only shooting on the streets 
was at weddings, in honor of the brides, something that has been 
done in Chechnya since time immemorial. The streets themselves 
were cleaner than in Moscow, and new paving machines purchased 
in the FRG (for $6,000,000) have already begun repairing road 
surfaces. 
  The conference was opened by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of 
the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, who immediately set the mood 
among those attending. Since, he said, previous crimes against 
humanity have gone unpunished, genocide is now on the rise. The 
U.N., said the president, "on which the citizens of the USSR 
pinned their hopes, has usurped the right to human life." In his 
opinion, in Russia there are no democrats, the West's human 
rights activism is a mere "fig leaf," and as a result genocide 
is becoming ever more refined and overt: "Russia's troops and 
armored units are cavorting across the entire USSR, showing off 
their might," said Mr. Dudayev. 
  Incidentally, the zealousness of many speakers at the 
conference is not without justification -- in the period between 
1792 and 1943-44 the Chechen people were removed from their 
homeland six times. Eyewitnesses to the deportation of the 
Chechens during the Great Patriotic War tell how NKVD troops 
shot down or burned alive the disabled, the sick and children, 
hunted down in the mountains those who managed to escape, mined 
their homes, and left poisoned food scattered about in the 
forests. The story of the life and death of many Chechen people 
in exile is a story worthy of respect. Also known to us are the 
suffering of the Shapsug people, who for many years have been 
attempting to establish an ethnic territory near Sochi, of the 
Crimean Tatars, who have returned home and have had to spend 
four years living outside Simferopol in tents and houses hastily 
pieced together out of any materials available, and of the 
Ingush, who dream of returning to their homes in North Ossetia's 
Prigorodnyy Rayon. 
  However, despite the fact that virtually every speaker 
declared that he did not in any way blame the Russian people as 
a whole, and that "those to blame for the genocide were the 
rulers of the time," a general anti-Russia sentiment could 
clearly be felt. Russia was accused of "considering the Chechen 
an inferior people incapable of governing a state," and of 
intentionally preventing the Chechen people from obtaining 
education. A former republic procurator read an entire treatise 
on persecution suffered by the Chechens in the Russian 
Federation in 1993-94, about how they were beaten and convicted, 
how people's assemblies forced them to move. Incidentally, these 
new facts were not accompanied by any information as to why the 
Chechen are still being subjected to persecutions that are not 
always unfounded (unless one counts the decree by Yuriy Luzhkov, 
which has been condemned by the world community). However, one 
should not think that now Russians are being subjected to 
physical violence by of the Chechens: Dzhokhar Dudayev warned 
that "any violence against the Russian-speaking population will 
be regarded on a par with the most serious crime" and, as one 
Russian resident of Groznyy said, "it is much safer for Russians 
to live here than it is for the Chechens." 
  Speakers addressing the conference accused Russia of 
great-power chauvinism, demanded that it give a legal, political 
and moral assessment of "cases of genocide," and that it make 
compensation for damages suffered by Chechnya during the last 
deportation (according to estimates by Chechen experts, a total 
of R522 billion [rubles]). In the opinion of a majority of those 
attending the conference, all "of Russia's crimes against 
humanity from the 17th century up to the present day" should be 
considered and condemned by the International Court and 
Tribunal. Russian recognition of Chechnya's sovereignty, 
speakers stated, is "the only real guarantee there will be no 
more deportations." 
  For fairness' sake it should be noted that not everyone in 
the ChRI [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria] defends its sovereignty 
so resolutely. Many people I spoke with would prefer for the 
republic to remain a part of Russia, though on certain 
conditions. Ruslan Khasbulatov, former speaker of the Russian 
Federation parliament, is very popular among the Chechens, and 
many people dream of seeing him as head of state, because "he is 
a real politician, whereas Dzhokhar Dudayev is more practically 
oriented and has a poor understanding of foreign policy." 
  On 21 May, in honor of the end of the Russian-Caucasus War, 
ChRI President Dzhokhar Dudayev issued an edict declaring that 
from that time forward the day would be celebrated as the 
republic's national holiday: the Day of the Beginning of 
Caucasian Peoples' Rebirth. In addition he decided to delight 
those attending the conference and apparently at the same time 
demonstrate to them his firm decision to create an independent 
state with all the appropriate attributes. He issued an edict 
awarding banners to the republic's armed forces. Banners were 
received by 12 units of Chechnya's regular army: the 
presidential guard, the military college, the special operations 
regiment (formerly the Abkhazian Regiment), the assault brigade, 
the Shalinskiy Armor Regiment, the internal troops, the 
firefighting troops, the border brigade, the missile and 
artillery unit, the air force, the airborne troops, and the 
aviation school. Then, to the tune of a military march and the 
roar of low-flying fighter jets, the troops passed in review 
before the generals and the president on Freedom Square. The 
president was dressed in military uniform and was wearing all of 
his USSR decorations and medals. 
  The president of the ChRI, accompanied by the 
vice-president, 
attended the conference all three days it was in session, 
speaking twice. The second time was to deliver a report in which 
he praised the democratic system of Chechnya, in the language of 
which there is no word meaning "to order," and express sympathy 
for the Russian people, whose tragedy, according to Mr. Dudayev, 
lies in the fact that "atrocities have been elevated to the 
level of a state program." In the opinion of Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
today religion is emerging as the trump card, and it is time for 
the Islamic peoples to establish a world religious center, 
either in Chechnya, or in Tibet, or in Jerusalem. In addition, 
he proposed the establishment of a Caucasian home "without 
slaves and masters," as well as Baltic and Central Asian homes, 
all of which would then be united on a peaceful basis. 
  The conference included in its final resolution the idea of 
establishing a World Islamic Center either in the Caucasus or in 
Jerusalem. From Russia it demanded legal recognition that 
genocide has been committed, recognition of the ChRI's 
independence, and the immediate commencement of negotiations. 
The U.N. Security Council, the resolution stated, should be 
stripped of its special powers and the international 
organization that guarantees the rights and freedoms of people's 
"radically reformed."

<F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Crime Has Decreased in </F>
Ingushetia: Law-Abiding Citizens Will Live in the New Capital"] 
  [Text] A report from the Ingushetian Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, presented for the attention of Ruslan Aushev, president 
of the republic, on the results of the department's work in the 
first three months of this year, notes a 20.1 percent decrease 
in the indicators for the rise in crime, as compared with the 
1st quarter of last year. This figure, the police emphasize, 
includes the indicator for the number of serious crimes, reduced 
by 33.9 percent, attempted homicides (27.2 percent), aggravated 
assault (12.5 percent) and theft of state property (17.9 
percent). Side by side with this, complains the republic's MVD 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs], it has not succeeded in 
achieving positive results in reducing the number of crimes 
involving theft of personal property and possessing and selling 
drugs. To the chagrin of the republic's organs of internal 
affairs, in the period being analyzed there was a sharp increase 
in the number of motor vehicle accidents on the roads of 
Ingushetia, in which 60 people died and 75 were injured. 
Notwithstanding the 33.3 percent reduction in the indicators in 
the 1st quarter, juvenile crime is a particular worry for the 
staff members of the Ingushetian MVD. The conclusions of the 
departmental report contain proposals on improving the work of 
GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate] and the management of the 
republic's motor transport enterprises, and on educational work 
among young people. On the initiative of the Ingushetian MVD, 
the republic is discussing the problem of building correctional 
institutions, which, in the opinion of representatives of the 
organs of law and order, should contribute to more harmonious 
relations between the people of the republic and the law. 
  At the same time, Ingushetia is preparing to build a new 
capital for the republic, an on-going building project which 
will be approved at the end of this June. The local press is 
presently carrying on an animated discussion on the name of the 
city, and planning-surveying work has already begun, six 
kilometers southwest of Nazran, on the banks of the Sunzha. The 
administrative-cultural and housing complex of the capital, for 
50,000 inhabitants, includes the settlements of Sunzhu and 
Ekazhevo. Right now in Nazran, a commission of architects from 
the North Caucasus is considering five plans, submitted to the 
government of Ingushetia, for the future city. According to NG 
information, the government of the republic has focused its 
choice on the design of the Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Urbanistics. Valeriy Kim, its director, feels that 
urban construction in Ingushetia should take into consideration 
the heightened seismicity of the region, as well as the special 
features of the foothill landscape. The dominant architectural 
features of the future capital, according to the design of the 
Scientific Research Institute of Urbanistics, will be the great 
mosque, the orthodox temple and the presidential palace. Open 
spaces around each of the objects, small streets with unique, 
truly Caucasian buildings, mountain slopes within view of the 
city -- this is how the architects envisage the new capital of 
Ingushetia. To NG's question to an associate on the staff of the 
president of the republic, as to whether a penitentiary would be 
included in the plan for the capital, it was said that by the 
time the city is built on the banks of the Sunzha (construction 
is slated for completion in 10 years), crime will be completely 
eradicated in Ingushetia, and the need for this type of service 
will fade away by itself.

<F P=106> [Article by L. Lagin: "Sociologists Suggest the Solution: </F>
How the Chelyabinsk Administration Makes Use of Their 
Conclusions and Predictions"] 
  [Text] In the course of a little over two years, a group of 
sociologists from the Chelyabinsk branch of the Institute of 
Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as an assignment 
for the Chelyabinsk administration, has been making sociological 
studies. The authorities are interested in everything: how the 
Chelyabinsk citizens feel under the new conditions and how 
certain specific actions should be planned. It would be a good 
idea to become familiar with certain aspects of this difficult 
job. 
<H8>  `Pro' or `Con' </H8>
  Practically every staff meeting of V. Tarasov, head of the 
Chelyabinsk administration, begins with the latest sociological 
poll and the conclusions and recommendations of sociologists. 
Moreover, in addition to the constantly repeated questions 
(monitoring) -- how much have the citizens adapted to the new 
prices, is their standard of living on the whole rising or 
falling, how satisfied are they with the work of a certain 
specific municipal service -- the directors of the committees 
and the head himself ask the scientists to take a special 
interest in some specific subject. On the basis of the data from 
the polls, a conclusion is drawn as to the advisability of the 
actions or measures planned by the municipal authorities. 
  For example, the question was asked: "Are the citizens 
planning to get vegetables and potatoes at stores or are they 
relying on their own stock?" It was ascertained that most of the 
Chelyabinsk citizens rely more on themselves and on the market 
than on state trade. This served as the basis for the trade 
committee to amend its plans and try to have a necessary, but 
not excessive reserve at the vegetable warehouses. 
  Another example. There was a great deal of "pro" and "con" 
about holding a trade fair on Revolyutsiya Square. The 
sociologists said unequivocally that the city needed these trade 
fairs. The administration was guided by their conclusions. 
  Before introducing compulsory registration for foreign 
citizens in Chelyabinsk, the sociologists were charged with 
determining the attitude of the citizens toward this extreme 
measure. Their conclusions convinced the head of the 
administration that it was not the right path. No registration 
procedure has so far been established, true, but it must be, by 
summertime. Also taken into consideration was the opinion of the 
Chelyabinsk citizens, that no daily payment should be taken from 
foreigners for staying in the city: a fine for violation of the 
registration rules is compulsory, but they do not have to pay 
for each day. 
<H8>  Life Has Become.... </H8>
  At one time our fathers and grandfathers were convinced: 
"Life has become better, comrades, life has become merrier!" 
Today this slogan does not do it -- one must operate with 
scientific data and figures. To what do they attest? 
  As sociologists affirm, over half of the Chelyabinsk 
inhabitants (54 percent) eat as well or better than in March 
1992. Moreover, in March 1992, this was true of only 42 percent. 
The percentage of those who have begun to be worse fed has 
dropped from 57 to 34. No one, of course, is shouting "Hurrah!": 
after all, this is one-third of the citizens! These are 
primarily the pensioners and the poorly-paid categories of 
employees and workers. It is to their social protection that the 
municipal services are oriented: subsidies, compensations, 
benefits. 
  The percentage of those finding it difficult to buy 
themselves clothing and footwear has dropped (from 86 to 58). It 
has been reduced by one-third -- good. What is bad is that these 
Chelyabinsk citizens constitute a majority. There must therefore 
be a group of measures to help this majority: pensioners, 
teachers, physicians, cultural workers and scientific workers. 
The conclusion of the scientists is: consumption of food 
products will increase somewhat, and the need for clothing and 
footwear will increase, but by much less. This is very important 
information for the committee for trade and services: clothing 
and footwear must be less expensive. 
  For the majority of the citizens (56.5 percent), there is a 
possibility of starting to work. This is 10 percent more than in 
1992. At the same time, there were only 1,038 persons, 0.61 
percent, officially (registered) unemployed in Chelyabinsk in 
February (compare: in the small town of Nyazepetrovsk, 11 
percent are unemployed!). Not counting the hidden unemployed. 
But this depends to a lesser extent, you will agree, on the 
"city's leading economic section" and its administration than on 
various AO [joint-stock company], AOZT and TOO [expansions not 
given], large combines and plants. 
  Yesterday and today and tomorrow, it is hard to find a 
person 
who would say: "I am satisfied with my life." Nevertheless, 15.7 
percent of the Chelyabinsk citizens are satisfied with their 
lives. This is more than last year. Some 56.6 percent feel 
dissatisfied, but this percentage has dropped. Compare: 73 
percent of the Moscow citizens, 72 percent of the inhabitants of 
Chelyabinsk Oblast but "only" 55.6 percent of the Chelyabinsk 
citizens put down "dissatisfied" with their lives. To some 
extent, this is an evaluation of the work of the municipal 
administration, which has managed to "amortize" the difficulties 
--although not so much that a majority of the citizens put down 
a favorable evaluation. 
<H8>  A Beloved City </H8>
  Chelyabinsk remains one of the major cities in Russia: it is 
in third place after Moscow and St. Petersburg with respect to 
industrial potential, and has a population of 1,161,000 people. 
It is both easier and harder to live in a city like this. It is 
easier because Chelyabinsk is a city of plants, the center of 
metallurgy and heavy industry. Specialists feel that tomorrow is 
for these precise citizens. For the same reason, it is more 
difficult for us to live today. 
  "How do you evaluate the situation in the city?" -- the 
sociologists are constantly asking this question. In all the 
years of the studies, the relative proportion of those who 
evaluate the situation in the city as tense holds steady in the 
area of 28 percent (one-third). Depending on the time of the 
year and the month, the number of Chelyabinsk citizens who 
consider the situation calm fluctuates (from 32 percent in June 
1993 to 14 percent in January 1994). On the basis of this, the 
percentage of those who evaluate the situation as on the border 
between calm and tense changes (from 41 to 57 percent). 
  In the opinion of sociologists, the most unfavorable months 
for Chelyabinsk are March, April and the first half of May. The 
peak of tension falls precisely in these months, year after 
year. There are several reasons: economic, climatic, 
psychological, organizational, material -- you cannot list them 
all. If you turn to preceding years, it is in spring that the 
mass revolts of the miners occur, with the protest actions of 
the metallurgists as their consequence. It becomes clear to 
anyone: in these months, the work of all the units should be 
organized with particular precision, without any breaks. 
  Specialists of the International Bank of Reconstruction and 
Development (IBRD), in drawing up predictions of a way out of 
the crisis in various regions and Russia as a whole, feel that 
the basic economic and social problems can be solved in a region 
or city taken individually, without waiting for them to be fully 
resolved throughout the country. The Chelyabinsk citizens were 
not acquainted with the conclusions of the foreign scholars, but 
nevertheless, every third one (32 percent) intuitively agreed 
with them -- they can be solved in our city, they can! Some 54 
percent reject this idea. The IBRD asserts that the industrial 
regions, where the metallurgical industry predominates, will 
start to come out of the crisis first. This includes Chelyabinsk 
and Chelyabinsk Oblast. 
<H8>  Feedback </H8>
  One of Russia's leading sociologists asserts: "With 
socialism 
there was complete agreement of opinion -- anyone who thought 
otherwise would find himself subject to the action of the 
repressive organs. Today, any authority, in order to hold its 
ground, must know the opinion of the people and amend its work 
in accordance with the reaction of the people." Feedback today 
is not a tribute to fashion, but a vital necessity for any level 
of authority. This feedback is working in Chelyabinsk.

transportation, where losses amounted to R6.4 billion. Almost 
one-third of all the losses in the sector were incurred by 
virtue of the enterprises and organizations of Chelyabinsk. 
  The nonpayments problem continues to be a critical one. The 
credit indebtedness of enterprises and organizations amounted to 
R2.3212 trillion as of 1 March 1994, of which R1.1673 trillion, 
or 50.3 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness. The share 
of enterprises with delinquent indebtedness to suppliers 
comprised 65.6 percent of the total delinquent indebtedness; 
only 8 percent was indebtedness to the budget. Bank-credit debts 
totalled R331.9 billion over this period, including 23.5 percent 
attributable to delinquent debts. A large amount of the total 
indebtedness is attributable to industry. The indebtedness with 
respect to loans procured amounted to R11.1 billion. 
  The large amounts of delinquent credit indebtedness are 
related to the presence of debit indebtedness. Thus, as of 1 
March 1994, debit indebtedness amounted to R2.3379 trillion, 
including delinquent debit indebtedness of R1.3037 trillion, or 
55.8 percent. A large portion of the delinquent indebtedness is 
attributable to the delinquent indebtedness of purchasers 
(R1.1673 trillion, or 89.5 percent of the total debit 
indebtedness). 
  It is mainly due to the lack of funds in settlement accounts 
of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, and 
agriculture that the timely payment of wages to workers is being 
delayed. The percentage of enterprises in industry that were in 
violation of the time frame for payment of wages was 34.6 
percent of the total number of enterprises in debt. In 
construction, the percentage was 25.4 percent, and in 
agriculture--40 percent. 
<H5>  LEVELS AND INDICES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>
  The consumer price index characterizing the change in actual 
family budget expenditures was 134 percent for March as compared 
with December 1993. 
  A determining influence on the overall consumer price index 
was exerted by sharp increases in the cost of paid services to 
the populace (costs rose 2.5-fold in March over the level of 
December of last year). The maximum rise in prices and rates was 
observed for housing and public-utility services (sixfold), 
including a 14.4-fold increase in services of the housing 
sphere. The rate of growth of passenger transportation costs 
continues--the March level was 307.6 percent of the December 
level. The trend towards accelerated price increases was 
maintained for consumer services (1.7-fold), communications 
services (2.3-fold), and tourist and health resort services 
(twofold). 
  Prices of consumer goods were 28.4 percent higher in March 
1994 than in December 1993. In general, price increases for 
consumer goods over the period in question slowed down 
significantly, especially with respect to food products. Food 
product prices rose 29 percent over December 1993 levels, 
including a 1.8-fold increase for fish and other maritime 
products, cheese, and vegetables; 1.7-fold increase for 
potatoes; and 1.5-fold increase for milk, dairy products, canned 
vegetables, and edible fats. Rapid price growth was maintained 
for vegetables, canned vegetables, and ice cream. 
  Prices for nonfood products rose 28 percent over the levels 
of December 1993, including a 1.9-fold increase for printed 
publications, 1.7-fold increase for flaxen fabric and matches, 
and 1.6-fold increase for detergents, thread, toys, and 
gasoline. Accelerated price increases were characteristic of 
children's clothing and footwear, knitted underwear, rubber 
footwear, glassware, stationery, television sets, radios, and 
medicines. 
  The consolidated index for wholesale industrial production 
prices was 144 percent in March over the December 1993 level. A 
significant price increase was noted in the fuel industry (price 
index of 171.4 percent over December). Increased prices in the 
fuel industry, the metallurgy complex (where the index was 116.5 
percent), and chemical industry (116.4 percent) brought about 
price increases in the machinebuilding industry (where the index 
was 205.4 percent over December 1993). The index for output of 
the building materials industry increased 1.9-fold. Significant 
price increases were observed with respect to the output of 
light industry (154.1 percent) and the food industry (124.1 
percent). 
<H5>  INDUSTRY </H5>
  The sharp production decline continues in industry. Physical 
volume of production decreased 32 percent as compared with the 
first quarter of 1993, 34.1 percent in March. The production 
decline was most significant in ferrous metallurgy, 
machinebuilding, light industry, and the building materials 
industry. The financial condition of enterprises, the payments 
crisis, and problems with production output sales are ever more 
frequently forcing enterprises to halt production partially or 
completely, to shift operating mode to one of shorter work 
periods, or to direct employees to take unpaid or only partially 
paid leave. Whereas 35 enterprises monthly on the average stood 
idle last year, the number for the first quarter of this year 
was double, and in March production stopped at 94 enterprises. 
  In the fuel and energy complex, electric power generation 
diminished by 19.8 percent, and coal production decreased 21 
percent. In ferrous metallurgy, reduced demand resulted in a 
36.6-percent decrease in the production of rolled metal, a 
13.3-percent decrease in the extraction of iron ore, a 
38.9-percent reduction in the smelting of cast iron, and 
41-percent decrease in steel smelting. 
  In the chemical and wood-processing industry, production of 
sulfuric acid decreased by 21.9 percent, and mineral fertilizer 
output by 31.9 percent. The reduction in output of synthetic 
resins and plastics was especially sharp--constituting only 3.6 
percent of the level produced during the first quarter of last 
year. Only the output of medicinal preparations increased, their 
growth constituting a 13.3-percent increase over last year's 
levels. Timber-producing enterprises produced 137,800 densely 
packed cubic meters of commercial timber over the three 
months--42.1 percent lower than the level for the first quarter 
of last year. Sawn lumber production decreased by 33.8 percent. 
  The most perceptible production decline was seen at 
machinebuilding enterprises. Production of metal-cutting machine 
tools, excavators, bulldozers, and tractors was reduced by more 
than half. Motor vehicle production decreased by almost 23 
percent. The volume of sector output decreased by 42.3 percent 
on the whole. 
  Production output of enterprises of the construction 
industry 
was reduced significantly in connection with decreased volumes 
of construction and the insolvency of clients. The volume of 
production output of these enterprises was reduced 37.5 percent. 
Production of cement decreased by 47.3 percent, asbestos-cement 
sheeting by 86.4 percent, precast reinforced-concrete parts and 
components by 33.5 percent, construction bricks by 43.3 percent, 
and construction glass by 40.5 percent. 
  The output of commodities for the populace diminished to a 
greater extent than did industrial and technical production 
output. In January-March consumer goods were produced totalling 
R272 billion--32.2 percent less in comparable prices than in the 
first quarter of 1993. In this regard, production of food 
products decreased the least amount--by 27.5 percent, while 
production of cultural and domestic products decreased by 31.6 
percent and light-industry commodities decreased by 56.6 percent. 
  Light industry continues to experience deep crisis. 
Production volume in this sector was reduced more than twofold 
over the three months. The production output of light industry 
totalled R19.2 billion, or just a little more than R5,000 on the 
average per inhabitant for garments, knitted articles, and 
footwear. Production of knitted articles diminished by half, 
socks and hosiery--by three-fourths, and leather footwear--by 
almost 57 percent. 
<H5>  THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX </H5>
  As of the start of the spring sowing season, agricultural 
enterprises of the oblast were supplied to the 98.5-percent 
level with seed for spring crops, including wheat--96.7 percent, 
millet--117.5 percent, and buckwheat--80.9 percent. Seed 
potatoes were supplied to the extent of 86.1 percent. The 
insurance stock for spring-crop seed amounted to 29,400 tonnes 
(59.6 percent of the demand). As of the beginning of April of 
this year, agricultural enterprises had 4.4 times less diesel 
fuel on hand than last year, and 2.7 times less gasoline. As of 
the same date, 21.7 percent of tractors and 24.9 percent of 
trucks were in a state of disrepair. A significant portion of 
these were to be found on the farms of Varnenskiy, Nagaybakskiy, 
Nyazepetrovskiy, and Chesmenskiy Rayons. 
  Over the three months of the current year, 27,600 tonnes of 
livestock and fowl (live weight) were sold for slaughter; 84,000 
tonnes of milk and 151.7 million eggs were produced. These 
figures are smaller than those for last year by 0.5, 24.6, and 
4.9 percent, respectively. One cow yielded 395 kilograms of milk 
on the average--91 kilograms (18.7 percent) less than last 
year's level. The average egg-laying capacity per hen decreased 
by 3.3 percent, amounting to 58 eggs over the past three months. 
  The decreased livestock production volumes were caused both 
by the diminished productivity of livestock and fowl and by 
their reduced numbers. As of 1 April, agricultural enterprises 
had 622,900 head of cattle (88.9 percent of the level as of 1 
April 1993), 221,500 cows (93.2 percent), 268,900 pigs (90.6 
percent), 395,100 sheep (81.1 percent), and 7,666,600 fowl (98.3 
percent). 
  The share of total sales volume of livestock and fowl 
attributable to state purchases was 70.5 percent for the first 
quarter of this year; milk, 93.5 percent; and eggs, 91.4 
percent. Some 16,600 tonnes of livestock and fowl were purchased 
by all categories of farms over this period, 54,500 tonnes of 
milk, and 133.1 million eggs. This is less than the levels for 
the same period last year by 27.4, 34.8, and 5 percent, 
respectively. In March the purchase price (not considering 
subsidies) of one kilogram of meat or poultry (live weight) 
amounted to R919, which was 3.1 percent less than the previous 
month's level. For milk, this figure was R201 (2.5 percent 
greater), and for eggs--R640 (3.2 percent greater). 
  As of the beginning of April of this year, there were 7,191 
peasant farms covering an area of 418,700 hectares (58 hectares 
per farm, on the average). 
<H5>  CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION </H5>
  We continue to see a decline in the scale of construction. 
Volumes of capital investments directed towards development of 
this sphere amounted to R211 billion in the first quarter, a 
decrease of 29 percent from first quarter of last year. 
Operations at a number of construction sites came to a complete 
halt. 
  As before, the main source of capital investments continues 
to be the funds that enterprises and organizations have at their 
disposal--R140 billion, or 66 percent. Some R71 billion, or 34 
percent, were allocated from the republic and oblast budgets. 
Thirty-nine percent of the total volume of capital investments 
were used by state enterprises and organizations; 60 percent--by 
joint-stock companies. Fifty-seven percent of all funds were 
directed towards the construction of production facilities. 
  The volume of capital investments directed towards housing 
construction decreased by 30 percent. The volume directed 
towards construction of schools, preschool institutions, 
hospitals, and clinics decreased by a factor of two or three. 
Total housing space commissioned amounted to 104,300 square 
meters--1,711 new apartments. This represents an increase over 
last year in housing commissioned of 13,000 square meters, or 14 
percent. The number of individual residences put into operation 
increased 2.5-fold; individual builders constructed 57 
single-family dwellings, totalling 5,300 square meters in area. 
  Some R3.6 billion was targeted towards measures to eliminate 
the aftereffects of radioactive contamination, of which R3.4 
billion went to the construction of residential housing 
facilities. 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION OF HOUSING </H5>
  As of 1 April 1994, 326,700 state apartments were 
privatized. 
This is 28.3 percent of the total number of apartments subject 
to privatization. In January-March of this year, 27,400 
apartments were converted to citizens' property (8.4 percent of 
the total number of privatized apartments). 
<H5>  TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS </H5>
  Freight shipments continue to diminish. The volume of 
freight 
hauled by public-use transportation decreased by 17 million 
tonnes (48 percent) from the level of first quarter 1993, 
amounting to 19.1 million tonnes. The volume of freight 
transported by rail decreased by 34 percent, motor vehicle 
transport by 59 percent, and air transportation by 55 percent. 
  No improvement is being seen in transportation services 
provided to the populace. The number of vehicles being put into 
service is being reduced, and routes are being eliminated or 
curtailed. In March, 7 percent of the scheduled bus and trolley 
bus trips in Chelyabinsk were not completed, as was the case for 
up to 3 percent of the streetcar trips. With respect to suburban 
and intercity bus travel, 5,000 trips were not completed in the 
first quarter, and about 500 trips were accomplished with 
schedule violations. 
  With respect to railroad transportation in January-March, 42 
passenger trains (1.5 percent) arrived an average of 1.5 hours 
late. Regarding domestic airline traffic for Chelyabinsk 
Airport, 18.5 percent of flights were completed with schedule 
violations, the average delay being almost three hours. With 
respect to Magnitogorsk Airport, the applicable figures are 10.7 
percent and 2.5 hours. 
  Communications enterprises rendered services during the 
first 
quarter valued at R16.9 billion, including services to the 
populace of R3.9 billion. This is 10.7 times greater, in actual 
prices, than the figure for the same period of last year. At the 
same time, the physical volume of communications services 
rendered continues to diminish. 
<H5>  THE CONSUMER MARKET OF GOODS AND SERVICES </H5>
  In January-March of this year, consumer goods valued at 
R411.2 billion were sold to the oblast populace. This is 5.3 
times greater, in actual prices, than the figure for the first 
quarter of last year. In comparable prices, however, the volume 
of goods acquired was 21 percent less. 
  The major portion of commodities (63 percent) were acquired 
in private stores. The share attributable to state trade was 27 
percent, consumer cooperatives 6 percent, and enterprises of 
other forms of ownership 4 percent. 
  The trade volume of public-kitchen enterprises amounted to 
R31.9 billion, 16 percent less than last year, in comparable 
prices. The share of production output done on premises was 65.2 
percent. 
  The volume of food product sales rose to R235 billion in 
January-March. In product volume, however, this represents a 
reduction of 10 percent from the level of the same period last 
year. The sales volume of main food products in organized trade 
is decreasing, including a 33-percent reduction in sales of meat 
and poultry, 48 percent in sausage products, 46 percent in fish, 
32-39 percent in eggs and margarine products, and over 50 
percent in canned meats and fish. A 12-percent smaller volume of 
vodka, beer, and other alcoholic beverages was sold. 
  At the same time that sales volumes of food products in the 
retail trade network decreased, increases were seen in sales of 
nonorganized trade, on the kolkhoz markets, for example, where 
the sales turnover of agricultural products rose 1.4 percent on 
the whole throughout the oblast. 
  The sales volumes of nonfood products decreased by 32 
percent, in comparable prices, amounting to R176.2 billion. 
  Paid services to the oblast populace during the first 
quarter 
of this year amounted to R50.8 billion, 9.2 times greater in 
actual prices than the 1993 level, but 65 percent lower in 
comparable prices. Privately owned enterprises provided almost 
14 percent of the total volume of paid services and 39 percent 
of the volume of consumer services. 
<H5>  MONETARY INCOME AND EXPENDITURES OF THE OBLAST POPULATION </H5>
  The monetary income and expenditures of the populace over 
January-March of 1994 rose more than fivefold over the level of 
the same period last year, reaching the level of R818.3 billion. 
The greatest rise in income was seen in February--a 1.3-fold 
increase over January income, amounting to R60 billion. The 
growth of income in March was 20 percent less than the February 
level (R54 billion). 
  Calculated on a per capita basis, the income of oblast 
residents came to R59,200 in January, R75,800 in February, and 
R90,700 in March. A slowdown was also observed with respect to 
growth of ready cash at the disposal of the populace and 
withdrawal of monetary assets out of the oblast. In 
January-March 1993 this rate of growth was 13.5-fold, and this 
year--6.7-fold. 
  The consolidated consumer price index for the full circle of 
goods and services continues to exceed the growth of income and 
consumer expenditures: 661 percent in March 1994 over March 
1993, while incomes over this period rose 6.1-fold and consumer 
expenditures--5.6-fold. 
  The amount of funds directed towards consumption in February 
of this year in all sectors of the economy, calculated on a 
per-worker basis, reached the level of R147,900. This is 6.7 
times greater than the level of February 1993, and 2.3 percent 
greater than the level of the previous month. 
  The level of average monthly wages reached R137,600 in 
February--6.6 times greater than the level for the same period 
last year and 1.2 percent greater than the January level. 
Average monthly wages in February decreased by 27.4 percent from 
the January level at institutions of culture and art, and by 
16.9 percent at planning and research organizations for 
construction support. 
  The highest wages in February were received by workers in 
financial and credit institutions and organizations--R332,400, 
and workers in transportation enterprises and 
organizations--R212,700. The lowest average monthly salary was 
observed at agricultural enterprises--R54,400. Wages in sectors 
of the nonproduction sphere were 5.9 percent higher than in the 
production sphere, amounting to R142,000. The highest wage in 
the oblasts of the Urals region was paid in Sverdlovsk Oblast 
(R143,500), the lowest was paid in Kurgan Oblast--R105,000. 
<H5>  LABOR </H5>
  Average authorized worker strength in all sectors of the 
economy totalled 1,348,400 people in February, 4.3 percent lower 
than the level for the same period last year. 
  Significant personnel strength reductions were seen in the 
organizations of data processing centers--by 19.2 percent, at 
procurement enterprises--by 13.4 percent, and at planning and 
research organizations for construction support--by 11.3 
percent. The average authorized worker strength doubled at 
enterprises engaged in general commercial activity in support of 
the market, and increased by 17.2 percent at institutions of 
culture and art, organizations of housing and municipal 
services, and organizations of the nonproduction varieties of 
provision of consumer services to the populace. 
  As of the beginning of April, 24,700 unemployed were 
registered with the employment service, including 22,600 people 
(91.5 percent) receiving unemployment compensation. Of the 
latter number, 34.9 percent constituted young people aged 16-29, 
and 64.3 percent were women. Some 14,100 individuals were 
entered in the register of unemployed over the quarter, of whom 
94.8 percent were authorized to receive unemployment 
compensation. (During the first quarter of 1993, 9,200 
unemployed were placed on the register, 8,900 of these being 
authorized to receive unemployment compensation). Some 7,300 
unemployed were removed from the register over the accounting 
quarter, including 3,300 (45.1 percent) who were placed in job 
positions. 
  On the whole, the number of workers being discharged is 
double the requirement for manpower. Thus, the number of persons 
unemployed will increase still further. 
<H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS </H5>
  In January-March 1994, the oblast volume of foreign trade 
turnover through direct ties amounted to $65.98 million in 
foreign trade prices. Goods and services valued at $43.951 
million were exported, including exports to industrially 
developed countries of $32.753 million (74.5 percent), to 
developing countries--$411,000 (0.9 percent), and to remaining 
countries (the former CEMA countries, republics of the former 
Yugoslavia, China, Korean People's Democratic Republic, and the 
Baltic countries)--$10.787 million (24.6 percent). 
  Oblast imports through direct foreign trade ties were valued 
at $22.029 million. Some 54.8 percent of the total volume of 
imports was attributable to the industrially developed 
countries, 5.8 percent to developing countries, and 39.4 percent 
to the remaining countries. 
  The foreign trade balance with respect to direct cooperation 
between oblast enterprises and organizations and foreign firms 
was a positive one in the amount of $21.922 million. 
<H5>  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION </H5>
  A gradual decrease in pollution is being observed against 
the 
background of overall production decline. Thus in 1993, 1.5453 
million tonnes of pollutants were discharged into the 
environment by surveyed enterprises. This is 34.4 percent less 
than in 1990 and 15.3 percent less than last year. 
  The oblast Committee for Ecology and Utilization of Natural 
Resources is monitoring compliance with environmental 
legislation. Enterprises paid fines in the amount of R26.3 
million for various violations of this legislation.

<F P=106> [Article based on report of the Volgograd Oblast Statistical </F>
Administration: "The Oblast National Economy in the First 
Quarter of 1994"] 
  [Text] The non-payments crisis continues to have a 
huge effect on the oblast economy. Not only has it had a 
negative effect on production and brought it into further 
decline, but it has also aggravated the problem of timely 
issuance of wages, pensions, stipends and other payments. 
<H8>  There is income, but no money </H8>
  According to the data of the oblast financial 
administration, 
the income of the consolidated oblast budget for the first 
quarter of 1994 comprised 147 billion rubles (R), and exceeded 
the expenditures by R4 billion. 
  According to the data of the Central Bank Main 
Administration, credit investments in the national economy as of 
1 April 1994 comprised R420 billion, and increased by almost 
four times as compared with the first quarter of 1993. The 
relative share of long-term credits within the overall volume of 
credit investments comprised only 7 percent. 
  The share of enterprises reporting losses increased from 27 
to 30 percent in February as compared with January. There was a 
particularly high relative share of unprofitable enterprises in 
transport, housing and municipal services and culture (from 47 
to 90 percent). 
  The unyielding payments crisis is aggravating the financial 
position of enterprises, disrupting the rhythm of economic 
activity and causing social tension in the production 
collectives. 
  Due to the absence of funds in the accounts of enterprises 
and organizations, payment of wages has been delayed. This 
question is particularly acute in agriculture. 
<H8>  What is in our pocketbooks </H8>
  For the first quarter of the current year, the monetary 
income of the oblast population comprised around R545 billion, 
while the expenditures were R410 billion. 
  Computed per oblast resident, the nominal monetary income in 
March was defined in the sum of R84,000 and increased by 28 
percent over the preceding month. Despite the significant growth 
in nominal monetary income of the population, the decline of its 
real value continued in the first quarter of the current year. 
  The surplus money on hand continues to increase. For the 
first quarter of the current year, it increased by R135 billion 
(for the first quarter of 1993--by R21 billion). A significant 
part of the cash money is being held by persons who have high 
income or who are engaged in commercial activity, and is being 
used by them as working capital. The increase in cash money on 
hand among the main mass of the population is associated largely 
with the need for current savings to make purchases at sharply 
increased prices. 
<H8>  Prices grow like grass in the springtime </H8>
  Consumer prices on goods and services provided to the 
population increased by 1.5 times during the quarter. Their 
growth each month during the quarter was stable (14-15 percent). 
  Prices on food products increased two times faster than on 
non-food items. 
  Of the food products, bread and bakery goods, milk, cheese, 
meat, vegetables and fruits increased in price by 1.8-2.1 times 
during the first quarter. 
  For non-food items, prices increased by 25 percent in 
January-March. 
  Prices on paid consumer services tripled in March as 
compared 
with December of last year. This increase was formulated 
primarily due to the increased payments on housing-municipal 
services (their growth comprised 9.5 times), urban transport--5 
times, communications--2.4 times, public health--2 times, and 
consumer services--1.5 times. 
<H8>  That is all--about us </H8>
  Population. The demographic situation in the oblast 
continues 
to remain extremely unfavorable. The natural decline in the 
population which began at the end of 1991, when the number of 
deaths began to exceed the number of births, has been retained 
over the last two years. The situation did not improve in the 
first quarter of this year: The natural loss comprised 4,200 
persons, and exceeded the corresponding indicator for the first 
quarter of last year by over half. 
  As was the case last year, there is a continued increase in 
the mortality rate and decline in the birth rate. The number of 
deaths exceeded the number of births by 1.7 times. During the 
first three months of this year there were 6,300 births in the 
oblast, and 10,500 deaths. As compared with the corresponding 
period last year, the number of births declined by 100, or by 2 
percent, while the number of deaths increased by 1,300, or 15 
percent. 
  As before, growth due to migration remains the only growth 
factor in the oblast's population numbers. In the first quarter 
of this year it comprised 7,400 percent. Of those, according to 
the data of the oblast migration service, forced migrants 
comprised 800 persons, and refugees--900 persons. 
  A further reduction in life expectancy was also noted. 
  Unemployment figures. In January-March of the current year, 
5,800 unemployed persons were registered, or almost two times 
more than in the first quarter of last year. By the beginning of 
April their number comprised 7,200 persons. Of those, 21 percent 
live in rural areas. Young people under 30 years of age comprise 
almost 30 percent of the unemployed. There are 2.6 times more 
unemployed women than men. 
  Consumer market in goods and services. Consumer goods 
account 
for one-fifth of the total output of industrial products, and 
comprised R228 billion worth of goods. As compared with the 
corresponding period for 1993, their production has declined by 
23 percent. 
  The production of food products declined by 22 percent. The 
output of meat and butter has declined by almost one-third; the 
output of whole milk products and vegetable oil--by 19-20 
percent, and the output of canned goods and macaroni 
products--by 42-43 percent. 
  Bakery enterprises have somewhat reduced the output of bread 
and baked goods. 
  The production of vodka and liquor-vodka products has 
declined by two-thirds. 
  The supply of goods in trade in the current year continued 
to 
increase, although the increase in prices significantly reduced 
the capacities of the buyers. Purchases of all basic food 
products declined as compared with the first quarter of 1993. 
  There were R114 billion worth of non-food items sold in the 
oblast trade organizations. As compared with the first quarter 
of last year, the sale of televisions increased by 14 percent 
and of household detergent--by 38 percent. The sale of 
refrigerators remained at the same level as last year. At the 
same time, the sales volumes of cotton, woolen and silk fabrics, 
tricot goods and leather footwear declined by 40-50 percent. 
  The sales volume of consumer services declined by 40 percent 
in comparable prices as compared with January-March of 1993. 
<H8>  Privatization and the voucher </H8>
  Beginning in 1992, there were 1,800 enterprises involved in 
the process of privatization. The overall value of the property 
of these enterprises exceeded R20 billion, which comprises 59 
percent of the overall value of state property. 
  One in every three enterprises privatized in January-March 
is 
in the sphere of trade, public catering and consumer services. 
Industrial enterprises comprise 28 percent of the total number 
of privatized enterprises, and building organizations--22 
percent. 
  The privatization of facilities in the current year 
generated 
monetary revenues in the sum of over R1.6 billion, and 
privatization checks--in the amount of over 160,000. 
  The exchange rate of the privatization check, according to 
the data of trading sessions on the Lower-Volga Commodity-Raw 
Materials Exchange, comprised R36,000 at the beginning of April 
(at the beginning of March it was R23,000). On the "black" 
market, privatization checks went for from R30,000 to R34,000. 
  Since the beginning of privatization (since 1989), there 
have 
been around 230,000 apartments privatized in the oblast (36 
percent of the apartments subject to privatization). 
<H8>  Dropped by one-fourth </H8>
  In the first quarter, industrial enterprises in the oblast 
produced R898 billion worth of products in effective prices. For 
January-March the volume of goods production declined by 
one-fourth as compared with the same period last year. 
  At the same time, 65 out of 332 enterprises increased 
production of their manufactured product in March as compared 
with the same month last year. Among these were: The Volgograd 
Plant imeni Petrov, the AO [joint-stock company] 
"Volgogradmebel" imeni Yerman, the AO "Keramicheskiy zavod," the 
AO "Plastkard," the Volga Pipe Plant, the Volga TETs-2 [central 
heat and power plant], the Karpovskiy Mixed Feed Plant, the AO 
"Volzhskiy orgsintez," and others. 
  Production of most vital types of products declined in the 
first quarter of the current year. 
<H8>  The rural areas are in a difficult state </H8>
  In January-March the financial position of agricultural 
enterprises, kolkhozes [collective farms], joint-stock 
companies, and peasant farms did not improve primarily due to 
the delays in payments for products sold, as well as the 
continuing disparity in prices on consumed industrial products 
and produced agricultural products. 
  Due to the shortage in monetary means, farms are 
experiencing 
difficulties in acquiring material-technical resources for the 
Spring planting. There is a chronic shortage of equipment, 
mineral fertilizers, toxic chemicals, and fuel-lubricant 
materials. 
  By the start of the planting season, agricultural 
enterprises 
had one-fourth less diesel fuel than last year, and 29 percent 
less gasoline. In a number of rayons the reserves of 
fuel-lubricant materials do not exceed even half of last year's 
level. 
  Equipment readiness for the last three years is the lowest 
in 
the current year. By the beginning of April, 19-23 percent of 
the tractors, trucks, plows, sowing machines and cultivators 
were in a state of disrepair. 
  The peasant (individual) farms are experiencing no less 
difficulty. 
  A difficult situation remains in livestock raising. As a 
result of the low recoverability of this product, the herd size 
of livestock and poultry continues to decline. 
<H8>  We are building, but not enough </H8>
  Enterprises and organizations held in all forms of ownership 
assimilated R112 billion in capital investments, which in 
comparable prices is 28 percent less than in the first quarter 
of last year. 
  R70 billion in capital investments were used for industrial 
construction, or 62 percent of all capital investments. 
  In the agro-industrial complex, R10 billion in capital 
investments were assimilated, or 9 percent of all capital 
investments in the oblast. 
  In the construction of facilities of housing-municipal 
function, R43 billion in capital investments were assimilated. 
Oblast residents received 859 new apartments with overall 
(living) space of 57,000 square meters. Of these, 19,000 square 
meters were placed into operation in the cities of Volgograd and 
Volzhsk. 
  The rate of construction of individual houses has increased. 
In the three month period, private individuals have introduced 
192 houses into operation, with overall area of 20,000 square 
meters. This is 49 percent greater than the corresponding period 
last year. 
  Among other facilities in the social sphere, a children's 
combined school for 280 students in the city of Volzhsk was 
placed into operation. 
<H8>  Plane, car, train... </H8>
  In January-March of the current year, the volume of cargo 
shipments in general use transport declined by 26 percent, 
including in air transport--by 67 percent, motor transport--26 
percent, and railroad--25 percent. 
  In railroad transport there was a reduction in the load 
level 
for almost all the vital types of national economic cargo. 
  At the same time, at the beginning of April there were 
283,000 tonnes of cargo on loading platforms, ready for shipment 
and not taken out by railroad transport. There was also an 
increase in the idle times of cargo cars at industrial stations 
and in cargo handling operations. 
  The increase in rates on passenger transport led to a 
decline 
in the passenger turnover. 
  The situation with services provided to the population on 
intra-city and suburban communications remains difficult. 
  In connection with the cancellation of runs, the shortage of 
fuel, divergence from routes and other reasons, 187,000 (20 
percent) of the scheduled bus routes were not fulfilled, as well 
as 29,000 (7 percent) trolley routes, and 10,000 (3 percent) 
street car routes. 695 electric trains were cancelled--6 percent 
of the number planned. 
<H8>  We are trading in raw materials </H8>
  The foreign trade turnover, according to preliminary data, 
comprised $129 million in U.S. dollars, and increased by 42 
percent as compared with the first quarter of 1993. The balance 
of foreign trade was positive in the amount of $76 million. 
  The oblast export comprised $102 million, and increased by 
38 
percent as compared with the corresponding period for last year. 
Raw materials, including oil, petroleum products and aluminum, 
continue to be exported. Their relative share in the overall 
volume of export comprised 88 percent. 
  $26 million worth of goods were imported during 
January-March 
of the current year. This is 62 percent more than in the 
corresponding period last year. Among these were machinery and 
equipment, raw materials for the aluminum industry, 
food-flavoring goods (sugar, coffee, tea, etc.), industrial 
consumer goods (clothing, shoes, carpets, etc.) and other 
products.

<F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Bagayev under the heading "Regional </F>
Privatization": "Kemerovo Seeks Ways of Nationalizing Industry"] 
  [Text] The regional authorities are unhappy with the 
results of voucher-based privatization, which has shut not only 
federal but also local bureaucrats out of direct regulation of 
enterprises' operations. In contrast to Moscow mayor Yuriy 
Luzhkov, who is openly opposed to "Chubays-style" privatization, 
outlying administrations are attempting to get around the State 
Committee for State Property Management quietly. But the goal is 
the same: to use privatization to turn state property into 
municipal property. Yesterday Aleksandr Lavrov, chairman of the 
Kemerovo Oblast State Property Management Committee, confirmed 
in an interview with a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent the 
intention of Kemerovo governor Mikhail Kislyuk to nationalize 
the oblast's processing industry. 
  Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the local government 
"overlooked" privatization of enterprises in the processing 
industry "in their haste." A portion of potential investors 
(participants in all stages of the processing and sale of 
agricultural produce), finding themselves outside the circle of 
privileged closed subscription to shares in processing 
enterprises, vented their rage on the oblast administration. For 
that reason, at a recent oblast meeting of agricultural workers 
Mr. Kislyuk told the offended parties that "the administration 
is prepared to resort to nationalization of processing 
enterprises, which will then make it possible to 're-privatize' 
them for the benefit of agricultural producers." However, in Mr. 
Lavrov's opinion the administration has no legal right to do so. 
  Therefore there are most likely two options for the further 
development of events. The first is that producers will appeal 
to a court of arbitration, asking it to overturn the local 
government's decision to privatize processing enterprises. 
However, in that case the administration will be blamed for what 
happened and will lose its ability to improvise in the sectors 
of the economy that are most promising from an investment 
standpoint. 
  Therefore it is clear that the regional authorities will 
insist on a different course of events. In the opinion of the 
region's leaders, the federal authorities should not only 
increase the regional quota for closed subscription on favorable 
terms to shares in processing enterprises, but also approve 
"from above" the region's initiative aimed at "preventing social 
tension" through "re-privatization" of enterprises. In that 
scenario, the local administration hopes not only to save face, 
but also to gain additional opportunities to redistribute the 
item that is in short supply, i.e. shares in enterprises that 
are attractive to investors. Furthermore, this second option 
gives the executive branch an exceptional opportunity to get 
control of (and hang onto) a controlling block of stock in 
highly profitable enterprises. It is also possible that in this 
manner the administration has commenced the realization of its 
plans to select the enterprises that will comprise the basis of 
the region's financial-industrial groups, whose operations will 
be controlled by the local authorities.

<F P=106> [Article by Gennadiy Belotserkovskiy, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI </F>
correspondent: "Contacts Are Not Turning Into Contracts"] 
  [Text] Rostov Oblast has developed regional programs 
for economic restructuring. It is the beginning of their 
implementation that is currently giving people there hope for 
the future, however illusory that hopes may be. 
  One of the main programs pertains to conversion of the 
defense industry, which comprises 6 percent of the oblast 
economy. The administration made the right choice when it 
entrusted creation of the program to the staff of the 
defense-related Gradient All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute, whose director, V. Blokhin, became chairman of the 
oblast committee on conversion. What eventually resulted was a 
collection of specific business plans for which R5.3 billion 
[rubles] in loans on favorable terms and R4.3 billion in 
subsidies were allocated by the central government. The oblast 
came up with another billion. According to estimates, within a 
year those investments will yield R2.0 billion in profit, and 
R2.6 billion within three years. 
  The region's unique location and the unique position of 
Rostov itself as southern Russia's transportation hub, a point 
where principal water, air and land transportation routes meet, 
also dictates that the authorities devote priority attention to 
the rapid development of those routes. All sorts of firms and 
joint-stock companies are springing up like mushrooms along the 
Don River, specializing in the creation of such programs and the 
search for serious investors to finance them. One example is the 
Port Petrovskiy Joint-Stock Company, which is intent on building 
a modern seaport near Taganrog. 
  The administration realizes that the meager local budget 
will 
not be enough to solve every problem. Therefore they have 
selected the most important ones, and then of those selected 
those that can be accomplished. Investment priorities have been 
established: the social realm, the agro-industrial complex, 
physical infrastructure, and construction of housing for retired 
military personnel. Incidentally, in one year the flow of 
investment into non-production-related construction increased 
from 26 to 32 percent. Housing completion increased by 4 percent. 
  But not everything is going so smoothly; some mistakes have 
also been made. It is has proved virtually impossible to attract 
foreign investors to the Don and get them to commit to major 
investments. Administrators from the Don region are busily 
traveling abroad and eagerly welcoming visitors, but contacts 
are not turning into contracts. Many talks with foreigners are 
for some reason being conducted quietly, in secret from local 
business people, prompting objections from the latter and the 
suspicion that there is some personal stake in this for the 
officials, some of whom would not mind dabbling in international 
business themselves. The Rostov Chamber of Trade and Industry, 
established by major enterprises and banks (with the oblast 
administration among its founders, incidentally) has for some 
reason met with a cool reception from the oblast 
administration's Foreign Economic Affairs Department, which 
views it as an unnecessary competitor, though they should both 
be pulling in the same direction. Incidentally, staff members of 
the Foreign Economic Affairs Department are, in violation of the 
"Statute on Federal State Service," also employed by the 
Integratsiya Fund To Assist Foreign Economic Operations. 
  Incidentally, a commission of the President's monitoring 
administration has studied the administration's foreign economic 
activities in Rostov. Its conclusions were, one must assume, 
serious, though for some reason they have not yet been revealed 
to the local public. True, soon after the commission's departure 
the head of the oblast administration signed Decree No. 93, 
which was sharply critical of activities by the Foreign Economic 
Affairs Department. Yevchenko was given until the end of May to 
come up with a program. 
  Of course, the programs by which the oblast administration 
is 
managing the region are only a first step. But, as the ancients 
said, if you do not know to which shore you are sailing, no wind 
will seem fair to you.

<F P=106> [Report by Vyacheslav Shchepkin: "A Governor in Conflict </F>
With the Constitution"] 
  [Text] An attempt by the head of administration of 
Ulyanovsk Oblast, Yu. Goryachev, to bring about a review by the 
Russian Supreme Court of a regional court decision which 
actually forced him to shift elections to the local legislative 
assembly from the spring to the fall has ended in defeat. The 
statute which regulates an election campaign was drawn up by the 
governor's subordinates with so many "stipulations" for local 
conditions that citizens' right to direct, secret, and equal 
elections declared by the Russian Federation Constitution turned 
out to be in question, to put it mildly. 
  They were planning in the oblast to create a bicameral 
representative organ and to organize voting in two stages with 
the help of electors--persons entrusted by their fellow citizens 
to elect the deputies. This was needed for an obvious purpose: 
they put forward their own nominations among the other 43 
representatives of the oblast administration at various levels 
for the 50 seats in the legisalative assembly. The protectionist 
articles in the local statute on elections were to contribute to 
their election as well. 
  Activists of the Ulyanovsk regional center of the Russian 
Democratic Reforms Movement and the Simbirsk "Democratic Russia" 
sounded the alarm. They instituted action in a local court 
demanding a review of the obviously overstated powers of the 
administration in the Statute on Elections. The Ulyanovsk Oblast 
Court contended that the third branch of government is also 
capable of holding a consistent and independent position in 
observing the law. It remained only for the governor to make a 
complaint to Moscow. Which he did. 
  The decision of the Collegium on Civil Matters of the 
Russian 
Federation Supreme Court set a noteworthy precedent in denying 
the recent appeal by Yu. Goryachev. No one has been authorized 
to rewrite the Basic Law of the state and adapt it to his own 
purposes. 
  Alas, the costs of the elections held in the oblast are paid 
from the budget, and hence out of our common pocket.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Representative Authority </F>
Consolidates Its Status (Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies 
Third Session)"] 
  [Text] As distinct from the first two, the agenda of the 
third session of the oblast soviet of deputies, which opened 
yesterday, was more than full. It included the following items: 
  --structure of the administrative machinery of the 
Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies; 
  --budget of the oblast for the second quarter and 1994; 
  --oblast soviet of deputies' expenditure estimates; 
  --rate of profits tax and enterprise and organization 
property tax; 
  --the law "Legislative Activity in Novosibirsk Oblast"; 
  --draft plan of legislative work of the oblast soviet of 
deputies; 
  --standing orders of the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of 
Deputies; 
  --the law "Support for the Activity of the Deputies of the 
Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies" and others. 
  But the first matter considered by the session concerned 
personnel--the deputy chairman of the soviet. Addressing the 
deputies, A. Sychev, chairman of the soviet, moved that the 
candidacy of Deputy V.Ya. Karpov be considered for this office. 
There were no other nominations. Vladimir Yakovlevich Karpov was 
elected deputy chairman of the oblast soviet of deputies by 
ballot (24 in favor, 8 against). 
  On the basis of A.P. Sychev's report the session approved 
the 
structure and list of personnel of the administrative machinery 
of the oblast soviet of deputies numbering 50 persons. The 
following committees were approved as part of the soviet: for 
fiscal, tax, and financial and credit policy; for economics, 
interregional foreign economic relations, and property 
management; for industry and the production infrastructure; for 
social questions, agrarian policy, and the consumer market; for 
social policy, health care, research, education, and culture; 
for the environment and natural resources; for legislation and 
interaction with the local government authorities, political 
parties, grassroots movements, and the news media; a consultant 
will operate under the auspices of each committee. 
  The soviet resolved to create on a permanent basis the 
institution of oblast soviet deputy assistants. 
  The deputies examined and approved oblast soviet expenditure 
estimates of R700 million for the maintenance of the 
administrative machinery of the soviet itself and R147 million 
for the support of the activity of the deputies. Having received 
the report of I.Yu. Glebova, deputy chief of the Office of 
Finance and Taxation Policy of the oblast administration, the 
session approved the statute "Rate of Profits Tax on Particular 
Types of Income and Enterprise and Organization Property Tax and 
Stamp Tax for the Registration of Enterprises With Foreign 
Investments." Specifically, the following rate of profits tax to 
be paid into the oblast treasury was approved: for banks and 
insurance organizations--30 percent; for exchanges and broker's 
offices--32 percent; on the income from video rooms and the 
rental of video and audio cassettes and recordings on them--57 
percent of income; on income from casinos and gaming houses--77 
percent (the decision on this will be published in full). 
  Active discussion was evoked by the question of the law "The 
Oblast Budget for 1994." Deputies G.V. Ivashchenko, A.I. 
Bulgakov, A.P. Melnikov, A.S. Plyushkin, A.K. Khilchenko, N.G. 
Krasnikov, A.A. Stepanov, K.L. Komarov, G.I. Makarenko, and P.N. 
Isayev spoke in the debate on this item. 
  The soviet approved the amount of revenue and expenditure of 
the oblast budget at R970.461 billion. Of these, R311.821 
billion will go to finance the economy. Some R239.345 billion 
have been appropriated for the financing of socio-cultural 
measures. 
  Discussion of the items on the session agenda continued at 
the evening sitting.

<F P=106> [Excerpt from the stenographic record of the Federation </F>
Council Sixth Meeting on 1 June 1994: "Federation Council Deputy 
Ivan Ivanovich Indinok: `I Will Attend This Rally. I Will Be 
Held Accountable for My Work and Yours'"] 
  [Text] [Chairman] I give the floor first to Ivan Ivanovich 
Indinok for a statement that he wanted to make. 
  [I.I. Indinok] Esteemed deputies, I wanted to make this 
proposal at the beginning of our proceedings, but this is the 
way it worked out--everything moved ahead quickly, and I 
understood that today my presentation and proposal precisely 
coincide with the topic of the issue that we are now discussing. 
  We can listen today to agricultural machinery builders; we 
can listen to producers of medical equipment, we can listen to a 
representative of the military-industrial complex, we can listen 
to anyone at all--the problems will be the same everywhere, they 
will talk about one and the same thing. 
  This is what I would like to say. More than a year ago, a 
"Person Unknown" tossed a rag liberally soaked in acid into the 
face of the chief of the Central Bank Administration for 
Novosibirsk Oblast. The man was crippled. He has now retired. 
Another person was appointed, a very energetic woman. We found a 
common language, and she began to put the banking system of 
Novosibirsk Oblast in order. We took the path of creating 
fiduciary banks and other solutions. 
  On the night of 31 May, at 0145 hours, an assassination 
attempt was made on Yekaterina Ivanovna Zhabotinskaya, the chief 
of the Central Bank Administration for Novosibirsk Oblast. She 
is currently in the hospital with numerous shrapnel wounds. Her 
husband has been operated on; he has lost an eye, and it is not 
clear how this entire affair will end. The assassination attempt 
was made by way of a grenade thrown into their apartment through 
a window. 
  Esteemed colleagues! This was done by a "Person Unknown." A 
few months earlier this same man, by the name of "Person 
Unknown" (not to be confused with the well-known sculptor 
[Neizvestnyy, meaning "person unknown" in Russian--translator's 
note]) cruelly beat up and crippled the general director of the 
Novosibirsk Beer and Wine Combine. A great many names are 
unknown in Kemerovo, where leaders have perished.... 
  In April 1994, Lieutenant Colonel Tomsov, the chief of the 
missile and artillery weapons service of a military unit based 
in the city of Novosibirsk, was arrested. Since 1991, he has 
misappropriated and sold to criminal structures 60 units of 
firearms, 135 Kalashnikov assault rifles, nine grenade 
launchers, 16 Makarov pistols.... Am I speaking to the point? 
  [From the floor] To the point! 
  [I.I. Indinok] In May 1994, a group of servicemen who were 
selling ammunition and had already sold 50 million rubles' worth 
of it were apprehended in the marketplace.... 
  Esteemed colleagues! A "Person Unknown" killed a deputy, 
persons unknown beat up on the deputies. Is it not high time to 
give first and last names to these persons unknown? This is a 
Cataclysm, this is Irresponsibility against the background of an 
economy falling apart. How are we to go on living? Recently, a 
presidential edict on fighting crime in 1994 and 1995 was 
issued. May God help this edict to begin making any impact at 
all. 
  I take part in the proceedings of the Federation Council. 
Last night, I tried to sum up the results: What have we adopted 
during the day, esteemed colleagues? We extended yet again the 
Edict on the State of Emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
This goes on at each meeting of the Federation Council. 
  I appeal to you, Ramazan Gadzhimuratovich: Are there 
leadership principles? For some reason, I have not heard your 
report or your opinion on this issue once. One of the leadership 
principles is simple: When the going gets tough, when they 
revisit the same issue several times, the leader heads the 
effort to solve the problem. The director goes to the shop and 
"clears away" the logjam. To be sure, there is one condition: In 
this case, the shop chief does not come back to his work station 
anymore. 
  For example, I subscribed to this principle in my work: When 
two people cannot agree, both leave. You know, this was an 
excellent remedy, and we always found a common ground. How much 
longer can we listen to the two presidents? I respect both of 
them. However, at present I am convinced that they are not 
stabilizing the situation, they do not need this. Look at how 
they speak. They already speak with hatred for each other. I can 
only surmise that, as he nominated himself president, he said: I 
will not give an inch of the land to the other republic. 
Meanwhile, the other said: I will make sure that my land is 
returned! 
  Esteemed leaders, let us do work. I cannot take part in work 
when it gets nowhere and is in vain. In July, we will have a 
recess. So we have been working for a year. Let us sum up the 
results. What does our prestigious forum, in which among others 
the heads of administrations participate, have to its credit? 
  Being aware of this assassination attempt yesterday, I voted 
in favor of putting the issue "On the Procurator General" on the 
agenda. I will tell you this, esteemed colleagues: It is 
questionable who gave more thought to the honor and dignity of 
the president--those who voted in favor of putting this issue on 
the agenda or those who voted against it. 
  I signed the Treaty of Accord. It has wonderful words in it. 
I want this Treaty of Accord to be carried out. Some of the 
opponents rebuke me: What are you signing, this treaty will not 
be carried out yet again! And I try to prove to them: No, it 
will! 
  Esteemed colleagues, I did not come here in order to be in a 
humiliating condition and position, I did not come in order that 
some people might say: This is not our jurisdiction, and that is 
not within our jurisdiction. What is in our jurisdiction? You 
tell me. What decisions must we make in order to get out of the 
chaos and the crisis that has embraced the entire country, all 
sectors--industry, agriculture, culture, and science? 
  I am inviting you, esteemed colleagues, to a grandiose 
rally-demonstration in the city of Novosibirsk. By a decision of 
the trade unions and managers of many industrial enterprises, it 
will be held with economic demands being made. Come, let us 
learn democracy. I will attend this rally, I will be held 
accountable for, among other things, my work and yours. 
  Pardon me, I might be overly emotional; perhaps, I have not 
put the accents correctly in certain words. However, I would 
like nobody to count me either among the left or the right, 
among his people or outsiders--I am a citizen of Russia, and I 
am not indifferent to its fate. At present, I am trying to do 
everything possible in my position, the position I have been 
entrusted with. However, they do not want to listen to me. I 
speak, I make proposals; we have held a applied science 
conference in which 25 territories took part, including you, 
esteemed Valerian Nikolayevich. There has been no response! 
  We have now created the Regional Support Center for Russian 
Statehood, which was founded by academicians, presidents of the 
academies of sciences--we wish to change this situation. What 
about the Federation Council?... 
  [Chairman] Ivan Ivanovich.... 
  [I.I. Indinok] ....We are back to square one. I will now 
wrap 
up, Valerian Nikolayevich. It is good that they at least furnish 
information to us. There is a wonderful article by an excellent, 
great specialist on self-government, Taisiya Zaytseva, in 
ROSSIYSKAYA FEDERATSIYA magazine. As a vice president of the 
Union of Russian cities, I worked on this issue with her. We are 
back to square one, as if there had been nothing before us. In 
another magazine, DELOVYE LYUDI, there is an article by Natalya 
Fonareva. It is called "Wild Advertisement in a Wild Market." 
Look what is going on in the country! There is deceit all 
around: Yesterday, Yulya and Igor danced for joy because they 
purchased the shares of the MMM Joint-Stock Company. They danced 
so hard they fell down. A correspondent said: How could you.... 
  [Chairman] Ivan Ivanovich, you are already over the time 
limit. 
  [I.I. Indinok] I am wrapping up and making a proposal: to 
hear at the next meeting of the Federation Council a report by 
V.F. Shumeyko, the chairman of the chamber, on the situation in 
the country and on the role and place of the Federation Council 
in overcoming the crisis that is gripping our country (I 
understand that this proposal is tactless to a degree, because 
it is being made in the absence of the chairman of the chamber, 
but anyway). Currently, I do not understand our place or our 
role.... Why has a proposal concerning the third deputy not been 
made yet? Why have we created a working group that should work 
together with the government? I came back from Nikolay 
Nikolayevich, and he told me: Wait until after the 10th, we will 
go and meet with the prime minister concerning your proposal. 
So, I waited on the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 15th, and I told him 
yesterday: Nikolay Nikolayevich, I was waiting for a call from 
you, and it never came. 
  Listen, if we want to make our contribution now, and just 
half a term remains for us, then let us begin working and be 
accountable for what we have been elected to do.... 
  [Chairman] Ivan Ivanovich, you have gone over your time 
limit.... 
  [I.I. Indinok] Thank you for your attention. I ask that my 
proposal be put up to a vote. (Applause). 
  [Chairman] Esteemed colleagues, I ask that you make 
political 
statements at the end of the day, once the agenda has been 
considered (Commotion from the floor).... I ask that you go back 
to the issue under consideration. (Commotion from the floor). 
  Letter from Federation Council deputies to Federation 
Council Chairman V.F. Shumeyko. 
  Esteemed Vladimir Filippovich! In the course of the 
Sixth Meeting of the Federation Council (1 June), Deputy I.I. 
Indinok made the proposal to hear in the course of a regular 
meeting a report of the Federation Council chairman on the 
situation in the country and on the role and place of the 
Federation Council in overcoming the crisis that is gripping our 
country. 
  We, the Federation Council deputies, insist on this 
proposal, and consider it necessary to specifically open the 
Seventh Meeting with it. 
  Respectfully, 
  Federation Council deputies
