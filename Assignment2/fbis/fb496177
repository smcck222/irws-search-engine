<F P=106> [Article by A. Alimov, department chief, Republic of </F>
Uzbekistan Goskomprognostat [State Committee for Statistical 
Forecasting], and E. Salimov, responsible organizer, Republic of 
Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet Committee for Economic Reform, 
Budgetary Policy, and Local Self-Government, under rubric 
"Facets of Reforms":"Uzbekistan Is Improving the Climate for 
Investors"] 
  [Text] At the present time the economic reforms in 
Uzbekistan are entering a new stage, which is typified by the 
expansion of the scope of market reforms; a substantial increase 
in the role of economic regulators; the creation of a 
competitive environment and a resources-saving economic 
mechanism; and the intensification of the selectivity of the 
state support of the material-production branches and the 
specific addressing of the population's social protection. 
  Steps are being implemented to stabilize and assure the 
further guaranteeing of the increase in production, including a 
consideration of the dynamic attraction of foreign capital; and 
to reinforce the financial system and monetary circulation on 
the basis of the introduction of a national monetary unit. The 
republic has begun to carry out structural reforms aimed at 
overcoming the raw-materials nature of the economy and at 
increasing the share of finished, competitive output produced. 
  The work in all sectors of the economic reform received a 
new 
impetus after the issuance of the January Edict of the President 
of the Republic of Uzbekistan, entitled "Measures to Achieve the 
Further Deepening of the Economic Reforms, to Guarantee the 
Protection of Private Property, and to Develop 
Entrepreneurship." The enactment of that edict is the latest in 
a series of crucial steps on the path of carrying out 
socioeconomic reforms. Indisputably, that document will promote 
the further rise in Uzbekistan's prestige on the international 
scene and the reinforcing of its economic and political 
sovereignty. Finally, that document has become new testimony to 
the fact that the young state is faithful to the course of the 
gradual implementation of reforms. Thanks to its unique path -- 
the correct determination of the rules and forms of the 
transition to a market economy --and thanks to the gradual 
formation of market relations, last year and in the first 
quarter of the current year Uzbekistan managed to prevent a 
sharp reduction in the economic indicators and achieved definite 
success in producing manufactured output. 
  In addition to the previously enacted laws governing 
foreign-economic activity, foreign investments, property, 
entrepreneurship, banking activity, etc., this edict has been 
called upon to effect a fundamental change in the current 
economic situation in the country. 
  The reform program is in acute need of resources, highly 
trained specialists, and the latest technologies. There is not a 
single branch that does not require radical modernization and 
major investments. Our country is currently faced with the 
serious problems not only of "our daily bread," but also of mass 
computerization, the creation of a technical production base, 
education and public health, modern means of communication, 
ecological safety, new energy sources, and many, many other 
ones. It is obvious that no one other than ourselves is capable 
of resolving these vitally important tasks and of making a 
breakthrough. 
  But there is something else that is true: history has given 
us such a short period of time that we cannot disregard even one 
chance out of a thousand. This chance -- and it is no small one 
-- offers us time. We are discussing the truly massive and 
purposeful attraction of foreign capital to our economy. 
  Under the conditions that have developed, the broad 
attraction of foreign investments would provide that gain in 
time that is so necessary for us. Experience that would be 
beneficial here is the Russian experience of the 1920's 
concessions and especially the present-day practice of 
transnational business, and of foreign entrepreneurship in the 
world's developed and developing countries. 
  The situation cannot be summarized simply as the obtaining 
from without of the resources and technologies that we lack, 
although, in and of itself, that alone would accelerate the 
process of getting our country out of its present situation. In 
these actions one can discern one of the incentives that 
facilitate the difficult process of gradually assimilating the 
market mechanisms of management, of creating for that purpose 
the necessary competitive basis of an antimonopoly mechanism, 
and, in the long view, an open economy. 
  As a truly inexhaustible market for the investment of 
capital, the Republic of Uzbekistan currently is carrying out 
consistently an open foreign-economic policy that is aimed at 
the successful solution of the problem of integrating its 
economy into the world economy. 
  The foreign-economic ties that are based on the active use 
of 
the advantages of the international division of labor must 
become an important factor in increasing the national income. 
The success of resolving the problem of including the republic 
in world economic space requires the carrying out of major, 
fundamental reforms, the diversification of the production 
structure, and the qualitative development of all forms and 
types of foreign-economic activity. 
  During the pat two years the foreign-economic reform in the 
republic moved noticeably ahead, primarily in its legal and 
organizational aspects. Practically speaking, all the necessary 
republic-level institutional structures have been formed. The 
Ministry of Foreign Economic Ties; the National Bank of 
Foreign-Economic Activity; and the customs services are 
operating successfully. Corresponding functional subdivisions 
are operating in the republic's government, ministries and 
departments, and local agencies of self-government. A 
republic-wide international-trade complex is being created. 
  A base of normative law has been created to permit 
enterprises to go independently into the foreign market. That 
base encourages the creation of new economic-organizational 
structures, including enterprises with foreign investments, and 
provides reliable guarantees for the activity of the foreign 
investors on the republic's territory in conformity with 
international norms and rules. 
  At the same time, the attraction of foreign investors 
remains 
one of the problems in the resolving of which our republic has 
been encountering definite difficulties. 
  As has been indicated by an analysis of the activity of 
joint 
ventures, there still exist problems and tasks that must be 
resolved by means of state regulation. For example, most of the 
SP [joint ventures] (more than 70 percent) are situated in the 
cities of Tashkent and Samarkand. In addition, enterprises with 
foreign investments that are very capital-intensive and that 
have social importance are being created basically only on the 
initiative of the republic's government in the fuel-and-energy, 
metallurgical, chemical, machine-building, and cotton-processing 
branches, which from the beginning have been oriented on local 
raw materials and the production of output to replace imported 
items. Enterprises that can serve as an example are the joint 
ventures that were created with such well-known companies as Deu 
Corporation (South Korea), Rank Xerox (Great Britain), Bursel 
(Turkey), Buller (Switzerland), Newmont (United States), and a 
number of others. 
  The course aimed at increasing the activity rate of 
attracting foreign investments and at increasing the 
effectiveness of the activity of the joint ventures raises, for 
the republic's state agencies, a number of qualitatively new 
tasks that are being resolved on the basis of chiefly economic 
methods of management under conditions of the transitional 
period. This is a guarantee to private entrepreneurship and to 
the successful formation and stabilization of market relations. 
  Foreign investors in the republic are granted broad 
opportunities, including the right to purchase on a competitive 
basis, for investment purposes, production areas, building, 
equipment, and housing, and to take out long-term leases on 
land. In addition, the question of expanding foreign capital in 
the privatization program is being worked out. 
  In order to provide the necessary financial and economic 
guarantees for foreign investors, a state company for insuring 
investments -- Uzbekinvest -- is being created under the 
Ministry of Finance, and some of the republic's gold-currency 
resources are being transferred to it. 
  A very important incentive factor is preferential taxation. 
In conformity with the legislation that is in effect, provision 
is made for freeing enterprises with foreign investments from 
payment of income tax for a period of two years after obtaining 
the first profit. The President's edict has freed from taxation 
that part of the income of enterprises with the participation of 
foreign capital which is reinvested into the expansion of 
production, technological modernization, and the implementation 
of social programs. The rate of the income tax of a foreign 
investor that is being transferred abroad has been reduced to 10 
percent. Joint ventures that specialize in the production of 
producer goods, in which the share of foreign capital in the 
statutory fund exceeds 50 percent, are freed for a period of 
five years, starting with the moment of registration, from 
mandatory sale of part of their currency proceeds to the Central 
Bank. 
  Something that is becoming an important factor is the 
developing system of international treaties that regulate both 
the general principles of commercial and economic activity and 
the principles of investment cooperation. Agreements of 
incentive and the reciprocal protection of investments have been 
concluded with West Germany, Turkey, South Korea, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, and India. 
  The question arises: why -- given the stable political and 
economic situation in the republic; the consistency in the 
actions of the Supreme Soviet and the President of the Republic 
of Uzbekistan in guaranteeing the legislative basis for 
protecting the investments; the very rich natural and 
raw-materials potential; and the favorable climatic conditions 
--aren't foreign investors rushing into Uzbekistan? 
  Without a doubt, there are both subjective and objective 
reasons. We are taking our first steps, without having any prior 
experience; we are being hindered by inertia in thought 
processes; the bureaucracy; etc. But this is a market. No one is 
waiting for anyone here. There is no time here to seek the 
reasons, whether objective or subjective. We must move ahead. We 
must succeed and resolve issues. 
  A very important question that requires urgent development 
is 
the creation of conditions that guarantee an assurance to 
foreign investors of capital that the projects to be carried out 
by them will be profitable. In this situation we are talking not 
only about specific terms that guarantee the foreign capital 
against political risks, against a change in legislation, 
against nationalization and compulsory requisition with the 
cessation of investment activity, but also about the creation of 
completely valid market space, in which the joint ventures, 
foreign companies, and their branches would have the opportunity 
to function under conditions of free entrepreneurship that are 
natural for them. 
  The new law, entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees 
for 
the Activity of Foreign Investors," which was approved by the 
recent session of the Republic of Uzbekistan Supreme Soviet, is, 
as it were, a logical continuation, supplement, and further 
development of the Law entitled "Foreign Investments in the 
Republic of Uzbekistan," with a consideration of the changed 
attitudes toward the problem of foreign investments under the 
new conditions. 
  In the final analysis, a decisive role is played 
specifically 
by the legislation that regulates the activity of foreign 
investors and that must necessarily guarantee them, in addition 
to all the other favorable circumstances, economic incentives. 
We realize that without such incentives it is difficult to count 
on any significant influx of foreign capital, especially under 
the present-day conditions, when the countries that are 
experiencing an acute need for foreign financing are actually 
competing among themselves in creating a more favorable 
investment climate for foreign companies. 
  The law entitled "Foreign Investments and Guarantees for the 
Activity of Foreign Investors" defines the overall legal, 
organizational, economic, and social conditions of investment 
activity on the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan. It is 
aimed at guaranteeing favorable conditions for national and 
foreign subjects of investment activity, and at guaranteeing the 
state protection of the rights, interests, ownership, and the 
industrial intellectual property of the subjects of investment 
activity, irrespective of the forms of ownership, for purposes 
of the effective development of the republic's socially oriented 
market economy, as well as for purposes of integrating 
Uzbekistan's economy into the worldwide economic system. 
  This law defines the state's foreign and domestic investment 
policy, which is aimed at creating financial markets, output 
(commodities and services) markets, and a labor market, and at 
types of vestments, and a procedure for carrying out investment 
activity depending upon the investment regulations that are in 
effect on the territory of Uzbekistan; and also defines the 
forms and procedure for the state's coordination and monitoring 
of the carrying out of investment activity. 
  The law provides a new definition of enterprises with 
foreign 
investments. Usinit the sizeg the international practice (the 
definition of the International Currency Fund), as well as 
bilateral agreements of the Republic of Uzbekistan concerning 
the procedure for excluding dual taxation, the law stipulates a 
low limit in the share of foreign participation in enterprises 
-- no less than 10 percent of the holding (stock or shares), 
which limit falls within the jurisdiction of the preferential 
taxation situation stipulated by legislation for enterprises 
with foreign investments. 
  It is necessary in the republic to strive for precision, 
stability, and consistency in the regulation of investments. The 
formation of this regulation must proceed in the direction of 
unifying the efforts in the activity of the domestic and foreign 
investors in Uzbekistan. In worldwide practice this is 
characterized as "natural regulation," the sense of which lies 
in a nondiscriminatory attitude toward foreign investors. The 
task consists in creating equal regulation for domestic and 
foreign investors in our republic. 
  In addition, during the transitional period at the initial 
stages of the reform it is necessary to grant foreign investors 
definite benefits that are aimed at reducing the risk of losing 
their capital. In particular, the article indicated emphasizes 
that, for foreign investors who are being directed into the 
priority branches of the economy and into the regions, the 
legislation of the Republic of Uzbekistan can establish 
additional benefits. And Article 11 establishes a procedure in 
accordance with which the tax system that was in effect at the 
moment of concluding the contract will be preserved for no less 
then ten years. 
  The experience of recent years and worldwide practice 
indicate that for the broad attraction of foreign capital it is 
necessary first of all to provide economic guarantees. 
  A way out is seen in the creation of a system for insuring 
foreign investments in our republic. The use for this purpose of 
only foreign insurance companies will not make it possible to 
resolve the problem completely. First, the insurance itself will 
be rather expensive. Secondly, and this is more important, the 
scope of attraction of investments will be extremely limited: 
the insurance companies will limit the size of the investments 
in a single "client," and the investors will not view the 
guarantees as being complete, inasmuch as, in the event of 
actual loss of capital in Uzbekistan, that can cause a definite 
overload in the foreign insurance system. 
  Therefore what would seem to most promising is the broad 
attraction for insuring investments of a definite part of the 
state gold-currency reserves and the creation of a National 
Insurance Company, as well as, jointly with the world's leading 
insurance companies, an International Insurance Fund. 
  On the whole, the law has been called upon to provide a 
qualitative turning away from measures of a limiting nature and 
bans toward a legal policy of intelligently admissible 
liberalization and to the dynamic attraction of foreign capital 
into the republic. The attraction of foreign investments to 
Uzbekistan is proceeding along the path of creating an open 
market economy, and, consequently, an effective one.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Kirchev, member of the Uzbekistan Journalists </F>
Union, under rubric "Nature and the Economy": "More Precious 
Than Gold: or, How To Build Interrelationships Between the 
Branch That Extracts Precious Metals and the Environment"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  World Money Is Being Extracted From the Depths of the Earth </H5>
  Gold. The first of the metals that were discovered by man. 
There is a film of mystery over this word. Possibly because, in 
the category of raw materials created by nature, it has occupied 
a special place. Nowhere else in the world has anyone found 
another product (with the same chemical and physical properties) 
that could be as suitable for the role of universal equivalent, 
as a single gauge of values. Incidentally, all this is well 
known. 
  Our Republic during the Soviet era was in the second or 
third 
place in the Union with respect to the amount of the currency 
metal that was being extracted. That, to a rather large degree, 
determined our Republic's weight and role. 
  Then independence came. And it brought with it new problems. 
It is well known that foreign investments can help to build an 
economically strong country.. We have political stability and 
civil peace. For a foreign investor these are very important 
factors. But he would prefer to invest his capital and provide 
credit if he is also given the guarantee that his capital is 
backed up by currency gold. 
  Nature has bestowed on us abundant gold-bearing ore. 
"Uzbekistan occupies eighth place in the world with regard to 
the overall volume of gold production and fifth place with 
regard to production per capita of population," Republic 
President I. A. Karimov said in his statement at the 4th Session 
of the Forum-Fund International Economic Organization in 
Switzerland in June 1993. "Thirty deposits have been discovered 
in the country, and their total reserves exceed 4000 tons... The 
quality of Uzbek gold corresponds to the highest world standards 
and, over a 20-year period, no claims were made against it. 
During the past two years it has been awarded three 
international quality prizes." 
  The extraction of gold and other precious and nonferrous 
metals is primarily a mining process. The ore specialists have 
been aided by science and by the technology with which 
Uzbekistan's mining industry has been abundantly equipped. The 
basis of the gold-mining branch is made up of the mines with 
shafts, quarries, and concentration plants. Their output is 
industrial concentrate with a large content of precious metals, 
from which high-grade gold and silver are produced at mining and 
metallurgical combines (Navoi and Almalyk). 
<H5>  Happy Birthday, Association! </H5>
  After the well-known 21 January 1994 edict of the Republic 
president, the State Committee for Precious Metals became the 
Association for Mining Gold and Processing Diamonds. Its short 
name is Uzalmazzoloto. At a meeting of the founders in April, 
the chairman of the association's board was elected. That 
chairman is 46-year-old Shavkat Nazhimov, who previously headed 
the state committee. He began his career in the gold-mining 
industry as a foreman at a concentration plant. 
  Our leading, strategic branches are managed by a firm state 
hand. Acting as the chief state instrument for management in the 
gold-mining industry are the fixed prices that are established 
for precious metals. The world price of one gram of gold today 
is U.S. $12. 
  Sh. Nazhimov says, "The state pays us only part of this. We 
take an attentive attitude toward this temporarily enforced 
measure: times are difficult for the Republic and it is 
necessary to provide for the social program..." 
  The higher administrative levels are considering the 
question 
of increasing the payment for the gold miners' output, but, as 
they themselves feel, the size of that payment must outstrip the 
inflation level. Otherwise it will be impossible to pay back the 
production expenses, or to replenish the mining capacities that 
are being depleted. Because the mining of precious metals must 
increase. 
  Mining is the "eating up" of the mineral resources. It is 
active contact with the environment. 
  It is no secret that in previous years we took the attitude 
toward the protection of the environment as being of secondary 
importance. Today the situation is changing. We have come to the 
realization that technology that is ecological tested or that is 
free of waste products (in almost every branch) means that that 
technology is also the most economical one in the final 
analysis. In the mining industry, destruction and waste products 
are unavoidable. If a ton of ore contains 3-5 grams of gold (and 
this is considered to be rather good content), then it is easy 
to imagine what mountains of ore have to be processed in order 
to extract from that ore hundreds of tons of the precious metal. 
  Today science, technology, and the environmental protection 
services are struggling to resolve the problem of these tailings 
-- artificial mountains. A large amount of money is being 
expended. We shall discuss a little while later how this should 
be done from the start in the best way -- both for the 
environment and for the economy. 
  Have you noticed that the association's name includes the 
word "diamond"? Didn't it surprise you to learn that we have 
this valuable stone here, although its homeland is the Urals and 
Yakutia? 
  This "raw material" for the manufacture of diamonds is 
delivered to the Almaz Plant in Burchmulla by the Russian 
Committee for Precious Metals. The hands of the local expert 
craftspeople who at one time studied at related enterprises 
manufacture two types of precious stones -- 17-faceted and 
57-faceted diamonds. The finished articles -- and the largest 
weigh as much as one carat, 0.2 grams -- are sent back to where 
the raw material came from. 
  Plant director Rustoy Ziyavidinov discusses his people very 
warmly: "These expert craftspeople with astonishing hands love 
their work very much." First the diamonds go to the markers and 
cutters. It is necessary to discern in the small shining stone a 
future diamond, and to "design" it correctly. Subsequently they 
go to the grinders and polishers. It is delicate work. The work 
ends with the facet-cutter. 
  There is also a shop for processing fianity 
--semiprecious stones from the Urals. In addition, the plant 
manufactures gold-plated teaspoons, engagement rings, sewn 
garments, sets of kitchen knives... 
  The shops at the Almaz Plant have been set up in the 
repaired 
facilities of the former mining and concentration combine which, 
during the war years and subsequently, used to mine arsenic. 
Tailings that have accumulated are also situated on the 
territory of the form bismuth Ustasaray Mine. There are a lot of 
tailings. For a long time ecologists have been demanding that 
they be carefully buried and rendered harmless, inasmuch as the 
poisonous substances are located on slopes above the Charvak 
Reservoir. Both the plant and association administrators 
understand the seriousness of this problem and intend to resolve 
it by the end of the current year. 
  The past frequently looks at us with loathsome ecological 
sores. They were created by us. And we are also the ones who 
should heal them. 
<H5>  The Ecology and the Economy Should Go Hand in Hand </H5>
  People's present needs must be satisfied without any 
detriment to future generations. That idea arose under the 
influence primarily of ecology. Ecologists attempt to correct 
the errors of the past and to look into the future. Economists, 
as a rule, are interested in increasing the immediate profits. 
Bringing them closer together contains the key to resolving many 
problems. 
  Does there exist in the gold mining branch any experience 
when ecological priorities guarantee the achievement of high 
economic results? I was told at the association that for a long 
time we have known about the existence of this kind of 
experience, but we were not able to acquaint ourselves with it 
first-hand until we flew last year to... the United States. 
  Sh. Nazhimov headed the delegation, which also included N. 
Namazayev, the leader of the association's science group; T. 
Igrashev, chairman of the oblast environmental protection 
committee; and A. Yemelyanov, chief geologist at the Angren 
Mine. They visited a private gold mining company. It is a small 
one that mines 13 kilograms of gold a year. 
  Our specialists saw progressive technology for extracting 
the 
precious metal from the ore. They saw a strong and very 
authoritative ecological service, the precise organization of 
labor, and high working efficiency. In a couple of days all this 
was perceived as something completely obvious. But there were 
things that made a staggering impression. 
  Just imagine being shown pleasant-looking slopes, hills 
overgrown with grass and little trees, and being told that just 
a few months ago there had been a quarry here, where operations 
with explosives used to be carried out, and where a road used to 
wind over the slopes... But where are even the slightest traces 
of this? There is nothing. All one can see is the primordial 
natural beauty, recreated by man with surprising diligence and 
with love. Even the little trees had returned to the places 
where they were born. It was fantastic! 
  What is this, then? The greatest patriotism? The strict and 
respectful observance of environmental protection laws? Or is it 
simply something that is economically beneficial for them? 
Apparently it is all of these things, taken together. They have 
fused together and given rise to standards of everyday existence. 
  Of course we shall not idealize everything that our people 
saw in America. That country also has a large number of 
ecological problems. But, objectively speaking, the people there 
were earlier in recognizing the seriousness of those problems 
and began to engage seriously in resolving them. 
  The second thing that could not fail to surprise our 
delegation was the poverty of the gold-bearing ores from which 
their colleagues extract the precious metal. Half a gram in a 
ton of ore? In our country that is the same amount of the 
precious metal that exists in the tailings. 
  One gram of gold costs the company $8. It sells the gold to 
the state at $12 (the world price). The remaining $4 are 
completely sufficient for reproduction, for new technology, and, 
of course, for providing the people with a good life. And 
necessarily one dollar out of the $4 will go into the protection 
of the environment. That's a lavish amount! We spend only a 
tiny fraction of that amount for those purposes. 
  The association -- this new structure -- will have to 
assimilate qualitatively new steps in environmental protection 
work. It must do so. Proceeding along this road is difficult, 
because the past has left us a "rich inheritance." Almost 15 
million tons of tailings. In addition, more than 50 million 
cubic meters of rock overburden have accumulated. Almost 1700 
hectares of land has been destroyed in the mountainous and 
foothill rayons. It will be necessary to recultivate several 
quarries. 
  But, no, everything is not really that gloomy. Interesting 
experience also exists at the Angren Gold Mine, where the best 
ecological results have been achieved and where the output 
produced is cheaper than anywhere else. 
  Last year the concentration plant that is situated here held 
a housewarming party on the occasion of the introduction of 
ecologically effective and highly productive equipment. The 
people at the enterprise have attempted to do the maximum to 
assure that no more ecological problems will develop in the 
future. And the intention is that that principle, which is 
based on the improvement of the technology and of the 
environmental protection service, will be introduced everywhere 
at the association's enterprises. It is for these purposes that 
a program for the ecological rejuvenation and technical 
improvement of the enterprises by the year 1997 has been 
prepared. It is planned to improve the process of secondary 
extraction of gold and silver from substandard ores and 
overburden, and that means additional kilograms and tons of 
precious metals. It is also planned to obtain building materials 
(crushed rock, sand, silicate and clay bricks) from waste 
products, and also to carry out secondary extraction of 
side-produced nonferrous metals -- lead, copper, zinc. Certain 
quarries and depleted deposits will be sealed up. 
<H5>  Prospectors Continue To Be Esteemed </H5>
  Whatever forces and capabilities of scientific-technical 
progress we put our hopes on or count on, a good result in any 
job invariably depends upon people's skill, knowledge, 
industriousness, and devotion. 
  In gold mining there continue to be a rather large number of 
people who have remained true to the traditions of cooperative 
handicraft labor. They are the prospectors. One should not think 
that these are only manual laborers with a pick and shovel. 
Their strong point is their maneuverability, and sometimes also 
their ability to extract a considerable quantity of metal at 
deposits with small volumes of gold reserves. Life is difficult 
for them. But the gold that they mine is cheaper for the state. 
  For many years a certain S. Bondarenko headed the famous 
Kyzylkum Cooperative. He died two years ago. The cooperative 
elected as its leader S. Aksenov, a smart miner. 
  The labor performed by the cooperative members is today in 
demand with new force under conditions when the problems of the 
material-technical support of major subdivisions have been 
complicated. And those cooperative members are successfully 
engaging in the mining not only of gold, but also of salt, 
marble, and coal. 
  Prospectors... It's a good word. It is applicable to people 
of any occupation who put their heart and soul into their work. 
Currently we are talking about gold miners. This branch has 
grown many expert workers and highly qualified specialists who 
deserve to have their names known. They include N. Karabayev and 
B. Dekin -- crew leaders at the Kochbulak Mine; S. 
Khudaybergenov, chief of the Kyzylolma Mine; A. Mirzayev, chief 
of the Angren Gold-Extracting Factory; N. Sannibayev, crew 
leader at the Zarmitan Mine; and many others. 
  When we have more people like this, society will be richer, 
and it will have more of all kinds of valuables, including, of 
course, gold.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Neyburg: "Joint Ventures in Economy of </F>
Southern Part of Republic"] 
  [Text] As the Republic of Uzbekistan enters the broad 
international arena, foreign entrepreneurs have begun showing 
great interest in the economy of the southern part of the 
republic. Almost 50 joint ventures are now operating in 
Surkhandarya Oblast. 
  One of them is at the Namuna Kolkhoz, which is not far from 
the oblast capital. The local confectionery factory that an 
Afghan firm is helping establish and operate produces products 
of excellent quality. 
  A chain of stores selling food products to the public has 
been opened through the joint efforts of an Iranian 
export-import firm under the Buned Foundation and the 
Surkhandarya firm Turon. This same route has been taken in 
Altynsaye, renowned for its vineyards. Uzbek and American 
businessmen have set up a winery there that will produce and 
bottle 1 million decaliters annually. 
  A tannery is being built in Denau in conjunction with 
Finnish 
entrepreneurs. A medicine plant at the Surkhan factory is also 
under construction. The latter project is being carried out in 
conjunction with an Indian firm. 
  Joint enterprises are now producing a very broad mix of 
goods 
for the consumer market: knitwear, shoes, furniture, and much 
more. Even more goods will be produced in the future, as joint 
ventures are currently being established with firms from China, 
Spain, France, and other countries. Special attention is being 
devoted to restoring business ties with the Commonwealth 
countries. One confirmation of this is the construction in 
Termez, in conjunction with Russia's Radiozavod Production 
Association in the city of Aleksandrovsk, of an enterprise that 
will produce black-and-white and color Rekord televisions.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan deputy </F>
minister of energy and fuel resources, by N. Shulepina: "Energy 
Systems and Gas Pipelines Are Indivisible"] 
  [Text] Beating politicians, energy officials were 
first to reach agreement on creating an integrated energy space, 
which they did two years ago. They serve the Greater Central 
Asian Energy Ring. A joint dispatching administration in 
Tashkent handles operations--determining station loads, 
operating modes, and maintenance schedules. It is subordinate to 
a council of energy industry officials of the region's 
republics, who meet to agree on who will produce how much and 
who will buy it. An agreement has also been reached on 
cooperation between gas industry officials. 
  How are the republics building their relations in the 
highly complex fuel and energy complex today? A PRAVDA VOSTOKA 
correspondent put this question to Erken Anafin, Kazakhstan's 
deputy minister of energy and fuel resources. 
  We get 600 million kilowatt-hours of Uzbek electricity 
annually. More than 3 billion more kilowatt-hours of Turkmenian 
and Kyrgyz electricity are supplied to Kazakhstan via 
Uzbekistan. For example, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan have energy 
surpluses, while Kazakhstan has a shortage in winter. And so our 
colleagues help us out. We had a difficult situation on our 
hands in the spring of this year as well. The Dzhambyl 
hydroelectric station was operating a single power unit, while 
five others were idled on account of fuel problems. We bought 
Uzbek gas on credit, as there was no fuel oil since we had not 
received petroleum from Russia. 
  The Kzyl-Orda Heat and Power Station is powered by Angrei 
coal. And another payment problem arose. Energy was cheap in 
Kazakhstan until recently, and so the industry operated at a 
loss. The tenge dropped in value, and our partners lacked hard 
currency too. And so we agreed to keep our mutual accounts in 
dollars. But when it came time to settle, we had nothing with 
which to pay. 
  We owe Uzbekistan $98 million for electricity and gas. The 
Uzbek side's debt to us is only one-tenth of that. It was a 
tough situation. We started looking for solutions. And we took 
drastic measures. They were economically warranted and fully in 
keeping with the spirit of a market economy. We raised 
electricity prices twice in spring, so that the prices were 
comparable to production costs. 
  The gas situation was also resolved in a market spirit. We 
cut off the gas to those who had not paid. We cut consumption to 
40 percent. Is that a little or a lot? We received 6.2 billion 
cubic meters of gas from Uzbekistan via the Gazli-Chimkent gas 
pipeline last year. This year we have ordered 4.2 billion, and 
we are not even using all of that. We took 1.3 billion in the 
first four months, but paid for 400 million. The Uzbek side took 
an understanding view of our situation, and said: Take what you 
need within the agreed-upon amounts. But we squeezed our 
enterprises. 
  We are in a difficult transitional period. There is no 
longer 
any rigid state regulation in Kazakhstan. As an experiment we 
are introducing the use of bills of exchange to settle accounts. 
For example, if you cannot pay in cash, we will take payment in 
copper or lead. The legislative basis for this is being created. 
The Kazakh president issued an edict in April on securities. The 
matter is now being worked out in the Economics and Finance 
Ministries. 
  In the meantime we are trying to utilize clearing 
settlements. This is not all that easy. We are unable to fulfill 
many of our obligations for reasons beyond our control. What is 
the situation, for example, with shipping petroleum products to 
Uzbekistan from the Chimkent Refinery? We try to keep on 
schedule, but Chimkent began operating at normal levels only in 
May. Before that there had been unbalanced relations with 
Russia, from which it gets the oil. We finally reached an 
agreement with Russia. We are shipping it oil from Mangizstau, 
and receiving Tyumen oil in Chimkent via the oil pipeline from 
Omsk and Pavlodar. And we are selling part of the oil to Fergana. 
  The Fergana Refinery supplies us with transformer and 
turbine 
lubricants for our power stations. Again you have an 
interdependence. It is very important to maintain good relations 
with our partners. We are dependent in very many areas both on 
each other and within the country. Let me return to 
clearing-based deliveries and settlements for them. We agreed in 
an intergovernmental accord that Kazakhstan will pay for energy 
resources with tinplate and iron ore pellets. The products come 
from the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant. But Karaganda is 
dependent on Dzhambyl, whose hydroelectric station was idle for 
virtually the entire month of April. 
  Uzbek gas is extremely important to us. We lease the 
Gazli-Chimkent gas pipeline, which runs through Uzbek territory. 
And the Uzbek side cannot do without the Poltoratskoye 
underground gas storage facility, in the vicinity of Chimkent. 
Its reserves guarantee vital services in Tashkent. And here the 
Uzbek side leases from us. 
  We also have problems with operations. This used to be 
handled in Central Asia and Kazakhstan by Sredazgazprom [Central 
Asian Gas Industry Association]. Since the Soviet Union broke 
up, we have divided its facilities and equipment. We established 
the Kazakhgaz [Kazakh Gas] State Holding Company. The gas 
pipeline is operated by a subsidiary know as Dzhetisugaz. The 
gas pipeline is 312 kilometers long. Our specialists have 
experience in operating such installations, as we used to 
service the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline and its compressor 
stations. But here we have dual responsibility. We have to 
ensure the gas pipeline's operation on foreign territory. Our 
lease agreements provide for mutual control and inspections. We 
undertook to deal with any accidents that might happen. But it 
is important to prevent them! 
  Now we are running into the problem of rising water tables 
in 
the pipeline's vicinity. This problem has to be solved with the 
local Ministry of Water Resources, which has to raise the dams 
and lower the groundwater level. 
  In general, the ties have remained strong at bottom level. 
All of us power- and gas-industry workers have worked together 
for many years. And today too we help each other whenever we 
can. We began producing fittings and oil-field equipment at 
converted enterprises in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Petropavlovsk, and 
Almaty, and we immediately informed our Uzbek colleagues. 
Partners in Pavlodar used to supply caustic soda. But last year, 
on account of environmental concerns, the enterprise was closed. 
And not only for us, but also for our neighbors. The situation 
is the same with lubricants, which no one in the region 
produces. For example, for 300-megawatt units. So we bought them 
abroad for energy workers throughout the region. 
  Our outlook? The economy will get on its feet. And our task 
is to maintain our fuel and energy potential and expand it.

<F P=106> [Report by Sergey Volkov: "A Real Headquarters May Soon </F>
Appear in Almaty. So Far Only Central Asian, Though"] 
  [Text] While Eurasian ideas so far remain on paper, 
the Unified Economic Space project (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzstan) is beginning to acquire an increasingly real 
shape. 
  One gets this impression from a frenetic pace of preparation 
of numerous documents for the July meeting of heads of these 
three countries that is currently being carried out in the 
bowels of Kazakh ministries and agencies. Despite personnel and 
structural reshuffling in republic state organs, more than 10 
agreements and accords are going through final polishing, which 
gives one hope for at least an outward success of the upcoming 
Shymkent summit of Presidents Nazarbayev, Karimov, and Akayev. 
  The unquestionable "bomb" among these documents (at least 
for 
other CIS partners) will be the substantiation of proposals 
being prepared by our side for making Almaty the site of the 
proposed headquarters of a permanent executive body of the 
"Central Asian trio's" intergovernment commission on 
intensification of economic integration. Kazakhstan is preparing 
not only the draft on this organization's status, but also its 
estimated budget, and will provide the technical infrastructure 
for its functioning. Such serious preparation for organizing the 
structures of the Unified Economic Space (EEP) seem to be 
pointing in the direction that this interstate structure is 
being set up seriously and long-term. There is, of course, a 
danger that even after setting up the organization's 
headquarters, as time goes by and circumstances change, its 
parents will lose interest in the idea of Unified Economic 
Space, and this will result in another unproductive squandering 
of the republic budget money. 
  Notable among other documents is a memorandum and program 
for 
creating conditions to reduce the population's migration. It is 
not yet clear, though, which migration Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
and Kyrgyzstan intend to reduce--interrepublic or general? At 
the root of this question is that it is quite difficult to 
separate the regional migration issues from general migration 
problems existing today on the territory of the entire 
post-Soviet space. 
  Naturally, in attempting to create something unified and 
economic, the sides concentrated their attention first and 
foremost on economic issues. Among them, agreements on the 
following should be noted: 
  --setting up an arbitration court (Supreme Economic Court); 
  --setting up a joint commercial bank; 
  --setting up joint enterprises; 
  --manufacturing cars on the operating capacities of the 
three 
countries; 
  --manufacturing cotton yarn and fabrics made of it; 
  --manufacturing textile machinery; 
  --joint construction of an Aktau-Beyneu-Kandagach oil 
pipeline and reconstruction of oil refineries. 
  Most likely, dealing with these items (if agreements on them 
are signed) will become the prerogative of the aforementioned 
Unified Economic Space's permanent executive body and the 
planned Business Cooperation Council (SDS), in which our side 
apparently will be represented by specialists from the Ministry 
of Economics, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and the 
Congress of Kazakhstan Entrepreneurs. The presence of the latter 
organization in the lists of candidates for participation in 
international structures says that the young businessmen who 
constitute its skeleton are already tired of simply asking the 
government for this and that and decided to engage themselves in 
writing economic history (even though only a Central Asian one). 
There is a concern, though, that the new generation of 
entrepreneurs will find themselves too much involved in such 
close cooperation with Cabinet of Ministers structures, which 
will eventually leave them firmly linked with the current 
government course, which is not particularly popular among the 
people. But this is, as they say, their own problem. 
  In short, we do not have to wait long to find out whether it 
is right to say that Unified Economic Space ideas are eternal 
because they are correct.

<F P=106> [Article by Oleg Kim, KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA: "In the Unity </F>
of Speech and the Press"] 
  [Text] The printing industry of Kazakhstan has ended up a 
captive of the severance of economic relations. Its life depends 
100 percent on imported equipment, binding materials, ink, 
paper, and other raw materials. The problems of this industry 
are now shared by all Central Asian republics of the former 
Union. 
  The leaders of the press systems of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, 
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan decided that a way to 
overcome the crisis should be sought jointly. Last year, they 
established an interstate regional commission for the issues of 
printing, the press, and book publishing on the initiative of 
A.S. Sarsenbayev, Kazakhstan Republic minister of the press and 
mass information. The commission was headed by Yanvarbek 
Tlevlenov, director of the Dauir republic newspaper and magazine 
publishing house. 
  The results of one year of joint work were summed up in 
Almaty at a regular conference of the ranking leaders of the 
systems of the press and mass information of the Central Asian 
states and Kazakhstan. A KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent 
asked [first initial illegible] U. Sandybayev, a Kazakhstan 
Republic deputy minister for press and mass information, to 
discuss the activities of the interstate regional commission. 
  "During this period, the working group of the commission 
held 
conferences in Tashkent, Ashgabat, Dushanbe, and Bishkek. The 
potential of each region from the standpoint of organizing its 
own production of import-substituting materials with the 
existing raw-material and technical resources was evaluated. We 
are quite in a position to manage ourselves in the publishing 
business. 
  "Thus, Uzbekistan is prepared to establish, of course with 
support from neighbors, the production of PVA [polyvinylacetate] 
glue, which is indispensable in book publishing. The Uzbek 
Varnish and Paint Plant can master the joint production of 
printer's inks, binding materials, and bookbinder's cloth. 
  "The issue of paper is also being resolved. Only two 
specialized enterprises that manufacture cardboard and 
writing-wrapping paper from imported raw materials and waste 
paper operate in the Central Asian region; these are the Uzbek 
Uzbum Joint-Stock Company and the TsKZ [pulp-and-cardboard 
plant] in Kzyl-Orda. Given the current state of affairs, it is 
necessary to support them not only through steady waste paper 
deliveries but also through funding from the budget. Following a 
partial retooling of the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ they would be able to 
establish the production of writing and printing grades of paper 
there. 
  "Representatives of Kazakhstan proposed another way to solve 
this problem. There are Chinese technologies for boiling pulp 
out of cereal straw and manufacturing various grades of paper 
with the pulp. Specialists from the Kazakhstan Ministry of the 
Press and Mass Information and the Kzyl-Orda TsKZ have already 
visited such operating enterprises in the PRC. Chinese experts 
have managed to familiarize themselves with our conditions and 
potential. It was resolved that the construction of several 
pulp-boiling plants in the vicinity of the breadbaskets of 
Kazakhstan is feasible. 
  "The Tajik regional commission submitted interesting 
information. Experiments aimed at producing paper by the 
unconventional method of 'wood molding' with the use of a 
completely new principle of polymerization in the electrical 
field are underway in Tajikistan. Wood of all types is suitable 
for manufacturing such paper. The Tajikistan Government is 
financing this project. In addition, they are working on 
producing rolled aluminum and PVA glue at one of the local 
plants. 
  Turkmenistan is also making its contribution to the common 
cause. Jointly with the Turkmensnab, the printing industry is 
"pushing through" spare quotas for alumina, sulfur, soot, 
silicates, and other raw materials necessary to manufacture 
printing supplies. 
  Deliveries of spare parts, modules, and assemblies for 
printing equipment have become a headache to all enterprises of 
the industry. At present, general combined requests for the 
assortment of spare parts are being drawn up. The plan is to 
manufacture the spare parts at heavy machine building plants in 
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The Tashkent State Design and 
Scientific Research Institute for the Integrated Design of 
Printing Industry Enterprises, the sole specialized design 
institute in the region, has become involved in solving the 
issue of a shortage of offset plates. Technical calculations 
have indicated that the most advantageous scenario calls for 
establishing a joint-stock company for the production of 
bimetallic offset plates in Karagandy at the facilities of local 
enterprises. The contract of incorporation has already been 
signed; preparatory work is already underway. 
  "However, the development of the industry is naturally 
impossible without the participation of other printing industry 
representatives of the once united state. For this reason, the 
Kazakhstan Ministry of the Press and Mass Information appealed 
to our Commonwealth colleagues for pooling our efforts in 
solving our common problems. 
  "Prospects have been mapped out, and the outcome of a 
well-conceived breakthrough toward cooperation as equals on the 
printing-industry market of the CIS will now depend on 
coordination and mutual understanding."

<F P=106> [Roundtable discussion under the rubric "Roundtable in GOLOS </F>
ARMENII"; material prepared by Marina Grigoryan: "The National 
Idea in the Party Program"] 
  [Text] That was the wording of the topic of the 
roundtable discussion held in the editorial offices of GOLOS 
ARMENII to which representatives of various political 
forces-parties and organizations were invited. Participating in 
the discussion were: Ashot Navasardyan--chairman of the 
Republican Party of Armenia, Aram Sarkisyan--chairman of the 
Democratic Party of Armenia, Igor Muradyan--from the 
sociopolitical organization Zharang, Sergey Badalyan--secretary 
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia, 
Grant Khachatryan--chairman of the union Constitutional Law, 
Karlen Torosyan--chairman of the executive committee of the 
Union of the Sports World, and Vaan Ovanesyan--chairman of the 
National Democratic Union. Let us note that representatives of 
the ARF Dashnakiutyun, the RamkavarAzatakan, the AOD [Armenian 
National Movement], and the ONS [expansion not identified] were 
also invited but, unfortunately, they did not consider it 
necessary to participate in the discussion. 
  A. Sarkisyan: Apparently to begin with we need a 
small amount of representative information about what 
unification around a national idea should be, taking into 
account the fact that our people have already proved that such a 
unification is possible and is a powerful consolidating force. 
This includes the problem of Karabakh, which, unfortunately, has 
degenerated into something else. This idea simply does not exist 
today, which is obviously a disaster for our entire society. In 
our view, this is the fault of the ruling force that came to 
power as a result of the consolidation of the people around a 
single idea. 
  As concerns the national idea in the program of the 
Democratic Party, it is fundamental and emerges from the 
following concept. We are faced with the problem of restoring 
the national image of the nation, which might also be the idea 
that holds things together in the matter of revival of the 
Armenian nation as a civilized one that respects human values 
and is developing in this direction. The restoration of this 
kind of image, in our view, presupposes the existence of many 
programs around which the most diverse political forces can 
rally. Above all it is necessary to determine national 
priorities--the range of these tasks and the possibilities of 
carrying them out. We see a number of them that could quite 
possibly be carried out even under current conditions. 
  But this is not being done. We have not created an 
integrated, constructive program, which, incidentally, is 
natural, taking into account the fact that the people who have 
come to power are not of a constructive inclination but, on the 
contrary, are working only for the idea of rejecting the 
communist one. As a result their actions have included so little 
that is positive that the effect is purely destructive. 
  Our party has developed a program in which Armenia's 
external 
priorities, its position and role in the modern world, have been 
worked out along with the domestic policy ensuing from this. It 
is even somewhat awkward for me to say that the difference 
between the national and the nationalistic is not only 
methodological but also practical in nature, while the president 
of the Republic of Armenia in his speech tried hard to prove 
that the end point of a national ideology is nationalism or 
fascism. One must assume that the failure of the program that 
they supposedly had required an ideological "packaging" of a 
bankrupt policy, because to try to prove that national ideology 
and national accord are false concepts is simply absurd. 
  In our program the national credo follows from common human 
values that, in our view, are in harmony with national ideas. 
Every people also has specific peculiarities that, of course, 
must be taken into account. And I do not know of a single 
democratic country that does not have a national program. 
According to the president's logic, for example, France would 
have to be considered a fascist state since there 
everything--beginning with the constitution and ending with 
politics--is subordinate to national interests, which in no way 
contradict the interests of other peoples. It is appropriate to 
recall that even General de Gaulle was put into power only after 
the society's democratic institutions were formed. Moreover, he 
initially became prime minister only so that he would not have 
the opportunity to concentrate an immense amount of power in his 
own hands, and only several years later was he allowed to become 
president. 
  GOLOS ARMENII: I would like to draw the attention 
of those present to the next point: If we think that in 1988 we 
had a consolidating national idea, how and why has it become so 
degraded that today we speak of its absence? Would the easiest 
path not be to heap the responsibility for this on the 
authorities alone? 
  A. Navasardyan: To deny the national idea means to 
deny the existence of the nation in general, to reduce all of 
our life to a process of liberation from prejudices. It turns 
out that we simply reject absolutely all values created and 
respected by nations and consider ourselves on this side of the 
barricade while on the other side there is nothing but falsity, 
illiteracy, idolatry, and prejudice. The so-called centrists can 
only run--from time to time serving on one side of the barricade 
and then on the other. In essence, this is the environment in 
which essential factors operate. In this sense the Republican 
Party is purely nationalistic since it is fairly well grounded 
in its world view and has its own ideology based on the priority 
of national values, considering them the highest ones after God. 
Naturally, national interests are the highest for us, and our 
defining concepts are the motherland, the nation, and the state. 
At the same time the creation of the state is by no means an end 
in itself but a necessary condition for the existence and 
development of the people, which should embody the most 
essential particularities of the nation. 
  In our view, in the world, on the one hand, there is a war 
with the purpose of destroying nations conditioned by the clash 
of various political and ideological concepts, and, on the other 
hand, there is a struggle for the survival of the species. 
Between these two poles there are a multitude of forces of the 
most diverse trends. We include ourselves in this range of 
sociopolitical trends that values highly the national gene pool 
and national peculiarities. Hence our idea of a state that 
contributes to the greatest degree to their preservation, 
development, and flourishing. In our view, today the Armenian 
people are considerably removed from a true self-evaluation, 
alienated from it, and therefore we set as our goal improvement 
of the society, interpretation of the path that has been 
traveled, and a striving for the future. As for the loss of the 
national idea we had previously, it has essentially dissolved in 
the worldwide ideology that has pervaded Armenia. But our 
society is searching again today--this roundtable is evidence of 
that--and it is trying again to find the foundation on which our 
national idea should be built. 
  G. Khachatryan: It seems to me that in our 
discussion it is impossible to avoid the existing background, 
which is, undoubtedly, the president's assertion that "the 
national ideology is a false political category." It is very 
important to understand why he said that. I am convinced that 
this was said not because the president himself thinks this way 
and not even in order to please someone outside Armenia. There 
was a different purpose: To weaken our ability to oppose the 
virus of extreme liberalism brought in from outside Armenia, 
against which our people have not yet developed an immunity and 
proponents of which are the ruling elite headed by L. 
Ter-Petrosyan. 
  This is where we must begin. And when we try to prove the 
opposite associations arise with a certain fable to the effect 
that one fool threw a rock into a hole and 100 wise men were 
unable to pull it out. Therefore, I consider it superfluous to 
prove that national ideology does indeed exist--that was proved 
long ago, and not by us. More essential for me is another part 
of the question--how the national idea is reflected in our 
party's program and actions. 
  The Constitutional Law Union program was written in 1989 and 
at that time the existence in the party program of points 
pertaining to national categories did not surprise anyone. They 
amounted to the following: 
  First of all, we declare our support for and devotion to 
absolutely all national values. Other points in the program 
pertain to national structures and, to a certain degree, they 
reflect the circumstance that the party skeleton was made up of 
people with a technical education. In our view, the best way of 
organizing the nation is to develop national structures. For our 
individuality, our personality, is sufficiently well formed just 
as are the following degrees of organization: The Armenian 
family, the concept of the Armenian community, which was 
flattened to a certain degree in the former USSR but was 
nonetheless preserved in the Western diaspora; the concept of 
the Armenian party has also been formed. In order to move on to 
a new level of sovereignty it is necessary, consequently, for 
the state to develop those national structures that are not yet 
sufficiently formed. 
  Unfortunately I must say that since the first days of the 
creation of our statehood, to our own surprise we have ended up 
in the ranks of the political opposition and have a greater 
opportunity to fight not "for" something, but against the policy 
that is aimed at the destruction of national structures. This 
can be rectified only if there is a radical change in the 
attitudes of the people in the direction of creative activity. 
Then we will have broader possibilities of participating in it. 
  S. Badalyan: I do not agree that there was no 
national idea--it was only because of it that our people 
survived. This is the idea of survival, the creation of our own 
statehood, an individual society, briefly, the idea of national 
and social liberation. 
  Let us recall where the notion of the lack of a national 
idea 
came from. The problem of Nagorno-Karabakh did not come up out 
of the blue. The forces that wanted to destroy the country, 
particularly the Armenian Republic, to get the Communists out of 
power, introduced the idea of the absence of a national idea in 
the Communist Party of Armenia, accusing it of departing from 
national approaches and betraying national interests. Hence 
there arose speculation about the need for a national idea, a 
national program. The falseness of this premise led to today's 
impasse. 
  For it turns out that the period from 1920 until 1988 was 
not 
the realization of a national idea, it was promised in 1988 but 
it was not found, and we ended up, as it were, at the 
crossroads. I do not think that the people today are unaware of 
the way out of the impasse. Do not count on political 
propaganda; the policy and program will become national not from 
frequent repetition of this word but from real activity on the 
part of one political force or another. The Armenian people have 
become civilized in a European way with the corresponding level 
of statehood--perhaps with a certain limited sovereignty--as a 
result of the policy conducted by the Communist Party of 
Armenia. All values toward which we are oriented, about whose 
salvation and restoration we are speaking, originated as a 
result of this policy--with all the shortcomings of the latter. 
  We do not see national self-isolation as a way out for the 
Armenian people. Over 70 years it has become clear that the real 
spirit, the potential of Armenians has been manifested only 
because of close contacts with other peoples of the former USSR. 
Only because of this has our people risen out of nonexistence. I 
want to remind you that during the war years it was around 
Soviet Armenia, fighting along with other states against 
fascism, that all progressive Armenians united--both inside and 
outside the republic. It was Soviet Armenia that became the 
embodiment of the Armenian people for a sufficiently independent 
existence, the development of culture, science, and economics. 
And today we think that the national program can be implemented 
in close connection with the historical surroundings of our 
existence throughout the past 200 years. We see the only way out 
of the existing impasse in the creation of a union of 
independent states--with preservation of all the attributes of a 
subject of international law. This is our historic destiny. If 
the largest states of Europe strive for integration, we have 
needed this for a long time. The collapse of the Union hit us 
Armenians hardest of all. Therefore we must be among the first 
to strive for the restoration of the union of states--taking our 
past mistakes and omissions into account. 
  It would be wrong to reduce all of our problems to Karabakh 
alone. But here, too, we have taken certain steps along with 
Russia so that when we create a new union it will include not 
only the former Union republics but also all disputed 
territories. If we want to be realistic and find a solution we 
must join together into a new union under a new name with a new 
content. There is no other way for the Armenian people--this is 
our national idea and our national program. In our view it is 
inevitable--and the sooner this unification takes place the 
sooner we will solve our national problems. 
  GOLOS ARMENII: Are we to understand that unless 
this new union occurs our people have no future? 
  S. Badalyan: I am fairly familiar with the 
processes occurring on the territory of the former USSR. These 
processes are going on and we must manage to be among the 
architects of the new plan. There are no other options for 
Armenia. Otherwise we will simply exist at the level of some 
kind of African country--Somalia, for example. And this, 
incidentally, would suit Turkey just fine. 
  I. Muradyan: Nationalism is a political method of 
preserving traditions. The Armenian tradition, the 
land-motherland was given to Armenians by the Lord God and 
Armenians must exist as a nation to work their land. These are 
the ends that must be served by the national system for survival 
and life support. This is what the Lord God wants. The national 
system of survival and life support must include as a totality 
the state organization, economic and social structures, and 
ethical norms. This system must not be based either on liberal, 
one-world, or on totalitarian-communist principles, it must not 
adopt either the left or right ideology, but must be based on 
the ideology of revolutionary conservatism, which presupposes a 
national, nonclass revolution for the preservation of tradition. 
  As a political method nationalism is identical to socialism 
and corporativism, at the bases of which lie the principle of 
subordination of the interests of the individual to the 
interests of the nation, on the basis of protection and 
preservation of the possibilities of the individual as the 
bearer of tradition. In the present historical conditions 
corporativism is a form of existence of those social groups 
whose vital activity is based on the life of the nation in the 
native land. That is, the motherland is for them a spiritual and 
material means of existence to which there is no alternative. 
The social base of national corporativism is the majority of the 
peasant-land owners and many of the most skilled hired workers 
and intelligentsia, and also part of the bourgeoisie, whose 
existence as a social group is conditioned by activity in the 
motherland. Unfortunately, only a small part of the diaspora is 
spiritually and materially interested in national corporativism. 
  The concrete conditions for Armenia's existence do not allow 
socialist or corporative methods that are based on the "theory 
of large enclosed autarchic spaces," whose ideologists are 
Leibnitz, Friedrich List, and Fichte, since Armenia will 
automatically be a part of either Russia or a liberalist 
supersystem. Corporativism is a guarantee of Armenia's 
independence under the conditions of its active participation in 
international division of labor and the struggle for an economic 
place in the sun. 
  Regardless of how politically attractive and aesthetically 
irreproachable one might find the truly traditionalist world 
line of conservatism, running from Plato and Thomas Aquinas to 
Leibnitz, Fichte, and List and brilliantly carried on by Werner 
Zohlvart, Artur Leclerc, Vandenbruk, and Alain Benois, the 
essence of nationalism lies in the fact that no ideology, 
regardless of how true, may be applied by a nation in 
cosmopolitical form. There is no nationalism without recognition 
of the unconditional priority of Armenian blood over any 
ideology. 
  Therefore the eastern Armenian national-conservative club 
Zharang sets as its task to develop a national ideology based 
not on conservative social concepts that are ultimately 
cosmopolitical but on the basis of an understanding of the 
essence of the national tradition that proceeds from the Lord 
God. 
  Political nationalism is unthinkable without the formation 
of 
a certain mentality, ethic, and style. This stereotype of 
behavior becomes national when an entire generation responds to 
the question "To whom does Armenia belong?" by saying "Armenia 
belongs to us." If the nation is truly viable and the Lord God 
is willing for it to express itself precisely as a nation and 
not a bearer of some alien cosmopolitical mentality or idea, 
this nation is capable of nationalizing any ideology. I do not 
see in Armenia any parties that would be bearers of any specific 
ideology. But if I am told that in order to save the life of one 
Armenian, in order to prevent one drop of Armenian blood from 
being spilled I have to accept some party--then I will do that. 
  A. Sarkisyan: Allow me to disagree with the idea 
that parties today unite people according to their mentality, 
etc. Perhaps this is not so clearly expressed in our reality, 
but still, parties unite people around ideologies. A party that 
does not express a national ideology simply does not have the 
right to exist. Let me give a concrete example. 
  The democratic party expresses the interests of the hired 
worker. If we are denied this right society will lose a good 
deal because there will be no parties expressing the interests 
of social segments. There is no need to jump from one extreme to 
the other. Cosmopolitanism is the same kind of utopia as 
communism. Incidentally, now, because of our president's efforts 
we are trying to insert ourselves into some kind of created new 
world order. This too is a utopia. But we are speaking about the 
fact that we must have a national program and the nation must 
carry it out. Today the idea exists; it is another matter that 
it is not of a consolidating nature. 
  V. Ovanesyan: The very fact of our discussion is 
evidence that this question is still open. It is not even that 
there is no national idea--in addition there is no understanding 
of what a national ideology is. In my view it is a fairly 
complex construct that should include the mysticism of the world 
view, cultural and historical values, economic formulas, social 
structure, and civil relations. It is not a text that can be 
placed in the program of some party--it is simply that in this 
organic "edifice" there are individual blocks that must be 
reflected in the programs of various parties. 
  In essence, a discussion of national ideology must be not of 
a party but of an economic nature. It is no secret that the 
primary cause of this discussion was the president's speech. Let 
us try to understand why such a speech was possible. 
Additionally, let us recall the background against which the 
national movement was born in 1988. In the large scheme of 
things at that time academic thought had not provided ready-made 
formulas, and the study of the history of Armenian ideological 
thought convinces us that we did not have the necessary basis 
for creating an effective modern national ideology. Rather, 
there was an ideological crisis, certain mothballed systems with 
respect to which we would have liked to express ourselves. 
  There are several integral systems. The Dashnak ideology of 
Aydat has a pyramidal nature that presupposes a supertask. As a 
counterbalance to this the opposite pole was formed, which has 
already been discussed here--liberalism that opposed all 
existing stereotypes. But neither of the poles, as it turned 
out, worked in reality. I wish to draw attention to the 
following: We criticize and reject liberalism, but have we seen 
it in action? Are the forces speaking today from liberal 
positions--particularly the president--actually liberals? Must 
we evaluate liberalism precisely from the results of their 
activity? 
  In reality the problem is that we still have not revised our 
past, our history. Nor do we have an interpretation of the 
events that have occurred during the past six years or provided 
an academic assessment of these processes. I would like to 
recall another of the president's speeches on the occasion of 
the 50th anniversary of the Academy of Sciences where he said 
that academic thought is not fulfilling its function. One can 
agree with this in part. That is, under the conditions of the 
universal vacuum, are said opportunistic purposes and we are 
trying in response to build some kind of "edifice" of our own. 
But there can be no serious "edifice" because our culturalogical 
and political evaluations are fragmentary, there is no organic 
binding thread, we have not clarified for ourselves what 
nationalism is or what liberalism is, and we need to reinterpret 
all concepts. 
  Thus one can state that Armenia is faced with an ideological 
crisis with two parameters: First--there is no consolidating 
ideology and second--there is no agreement about the issues that 
compose one. Several approaches are being offered: Absolutely 
nationalistic and to a certain degree socialist formulas which 
are not revealed since their bearers themselves do not 
understand their essence; spineless liberal democracy, which 
does not exist as such-in reality a groundless state is being 
created. Mr. Byadalyan offers another version--to place basic 
responsibility on Russia again and work together, but then the 
center of gravity shifts as well. 
  All of these constructs are imperfect since with respect to 
any of them there arises a multitude of questions for which 
their apologists have no answers. There is no ideological 
construct today that is capable of rallying the society around 
itself and hence the lack of economic, foreign political, 
social, and other programs. 
  I would call the field within which the National Democratic 
Union is seeking a solution a synthesis of two opposing 
currents. The first is a reformation of the national supertask 
in issues related to Aydat, and the second--nationalization of 
the liberal-democratic system of values. But generally speaking 
parties cannot within themselves or in interparty contacts 
resolve problems of creating a national ideology since academic 
circles have not yet been drawn into this process. In the press 
today you will not find material of a conceptual nature, they 
are rather of a situational nature--that is, in essence the 
edifice has no first floor. It is by taking advantage of this 
vacuum that the president can allow himself to say absolutely 
absurd things. I envision the national ideology in the form of 
an open construct in which it is possible to unite around 
questions and separate in their answers. But we do not have an 
integrated idea of the range of these questions and therefore we 
cannot speak of answers yet. 
  A. Navasardyan: It is unthinkable to draw any 
conclusions today. The political parties are trying to adapt to 
the situation without any ideology and trying only to achieve a 
certain harmony of existing forces. I think that this is 
actually only a desire to adapt, but based on what and in order 
to preserve what? That in and of itself is already an ideology. 
Ultimately everything amounts to the main question: for the sake 
of what? For the sake of what are we striving to have a state 
and a competitive society? It is this question that lies at the 
basis of ideology while the other one--how?--determines the 
mechanisms. 
  K. Torosyan: We agree with many of the ideas 
expressed here, but our party's ideology is closest to what I. 
Muradyan said. I would very earnestly ask you not to scornfully 
view the concept of the sports world as people who engage only 
in sports. That is not true. The area of sports has produced 
many outstanding people--bearers of national ideology. They have 
always been bothered by the fact that they do not represent 
their motherland, Armenia, in the world arena, even during the 
times of the Soviet Union. Today they are acting under the flag 
of Armenia and, naturally, each of them would dream of acting 
under the flag of Great Armenia. Nonetheless sportsmen 
necessarily must bear a certain ideology--without it they cannot 
represent either their homeland or their nation. 
  We consider the main thing to be to preserve national 
traditions arising out of the depth of centuries and bearing a 
moral principle. What is a man in our understanding. He is above 
all a soldier for the motherland, which presupposes a high 
degree of physical, moral, and spiritual development. This is 
one of the postulates of our ideology. For us it is very 
important to have, if you will, knightly qualities of Armenian 
men, including devotion, a sense of duty and responsibility, etc. 
  When speaking of the problems bothering our people today we 
must not, of course, fail to mention first of all Artsakh. Here 
our position is simple: We are in favor of what the people of 
Artsakh want and choose for themselves--freedom. Exactly the 
same thing is true with questions of Aydat: These lands were 
given to us by God and we shall always look at the map with hope 
and faith. These are more future problems, as it were, as 
distinct from those of the present day. They amount to the 
following: Structures have been destroyed, we need new 
approaches, and in these conditions strong and courageous people 
must influence the rest with their ideology so that the people 
will achieve their goals. I would not want to criticize anybody 
but it seems to me that any party must be an advocate of the 
idea of a strong Armenia. How to achieve this is another 
question. 
  Many question the need for the creation of our party. But 
the 
people gathered in it are famous, they are bearers of the 
national ideology, and they are capable of leading. We would 
like very much for our ideology to be aimed at the creation of a 
national school where patriotic education would be at the very 
highest level. For us it is very important to have close 
contacts with other parties and on this plane today's roundtable 
has done a great deal for us. We need joint efforts of all in 
order to bring the people out of the crisis. 
  S. Badalyan: Meetings like this are indeed very 
necessary and not only for exchanging ideas. In essence our 
major and common idea today is the existing crisis of power and 
the need to constitutionally remove the ruling grouping from 
power and hold early elections. And on the plane of preparing 
for these elections a permanent roundtable would be very useful. 
  I liked V. Ovyanesyan's analytical approach to the problem. 
But I want to ask one thing: In your attitude toward the 
Communist Party do not be guided by the stereotype that we want 
to shift the responsibility to Russia once again. We are 
speaking only about a voluntary association of states with equal 
rights. The first such experiment, with all its minuses, 
provided for the flourishing of our people and therefore we want 
to be among the architects of the new union. 
  V. Ovyanesyan: I, too, have a request of that 
nature. You spoke of a stereotype with respect to the Communist 
Party. But there is also another stereotype--anti-Russism which, 
in my view, is of a mythical nature. Let us agree that in 
Armenia there are no nonpragmatic, anti-Russian vectors, there 
are only differences in approaches. And only on the basis of 
this will we hold further discussion, in any case, the image of 
the enemy should not be created on this soil. 
  GOLOS ARMENII: In concluding our discussion, let 
us return to the question as initially posed. In principle we 
all agree that in 1988 there was a national consolidating 
idea--Karabakh. But while six years ago this idea brought almost 
a million people out into the square, if it was capable of 
ousting the communist regime from power, today's sad realities 
are that in parliament there were not even 123 votes for 
including on the agenda a discussion of the Karabakh problem in 
light of the latest events. 
  Nonetheless one can state that the Karabakh movement has not 
solved all of its problems. We suggest giving a brief answer to 
this question: Is it possible today to revive the Karabakh idea 
and rally the nation around it? 
  S. Badalyan: I am absolutely certain that it is 
unthinkable to solve the problems facing our people without 
solving the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is a necessary 
constituent part of both the national ideology and the national 
program. 
  A. Sarkisyan: I think that the consolidating idea 
for today could be the problem of ways of establishing the 
state. As for the model, we see it as social democracy taking 
our national specifics into account. 
  Moreover, we have to get away from revolutionary romanticism 
in any case. It seemed to me that we had already gotten over 
this disease but, unfortunately, this approach still exists. In 
any case we must deal with reality and proceed from the fact 
that national interests must be subordinated to existing 
political realities. 
  A. Navasardyan: The accusation of romanticism 
probably proceeds from the fact that I may have understood the 
topic of the roundtable incorrectly since several of the 
statements heard here pertained rather to mechanisms than a 
truly national idea. As for the ideological vacuum, it seems to 
me that there is none since every party has its own ideology, in 
any case, its activity must clearly show which ideology is 
served by one party or another. On this plane the Republican 
Party has a very clear ideology. 
  G. Khachatryan: The only consolidating idea there 
can be is freedom of the nation, which also guarantees freedom 
to each of its representatives. Why does the idea that worked in 
1988 not exist today? The people's mass awareness has received 
the idea that slavery is valued more highly than freedom. The 
idea may work again, in the first place, when people are 
convinced that slavery certainly did not reward everyone with 
the same generosity and, in the second place, when those who are 
rewarded understand that material goods are certainly not a 
criterion for freedom. 
  I. Muradyan: I consider romanticism to be the 
presumption that the people can be the bearer of a national idea 
in a formalized way. This is a harmful and dangerous illusion. 
People must have certain stamps, they must have a clear idea of 
who is an enemy and who is a friend. As seen by the people the 
national idea should be expressed by certain tabulated concepts 
and categories. For example: Karabakh must not be betrayed. This 
is a taboo and if we go against it, it will be the beginning of 
degradation. And the task of political parties is to understand 
and interpret the processes taking place and be able to present 
them to the people. 
  G. Ovanesyan: It is difficult for me to give a 
simple answer to such a large question. In any case, today the 
consolidating idea could be that of a leader who is capable of 
showing us the way into the 20th century as a strong state with 
a free Karabakh, a self-organization of Armenians on a worldwide 
scale. 
  K. Torosyan: I think that under conditions where a 
considerable part of the society is deprived of any hope and is 
apolitical, our task is to be able to inspire and unite people 
within the framework of the national idea that has been 
discussed today. As for Karabakh, this has already become a 
question of national honor for our people. There is no other 
solution but the expression of the will of the people. 
  GOLOS ARMENII: We thank you all for participating 
in our roundtable and we hope the discussion was useful to you 
and interesting to the readers.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Golotyuk: "There Will Be No Demographic </F>
Catastrophe: The Women of Nagorno-Karabakh Are Giving Birth to a 
New Generation"] 
  [Text] Estimates by certain experts who predict that after 
slightly more than five and a half years of warfare 
Nagorno-Karabakh is just about on the brink of a demographic 
catastrophe seem excessively pessimistic. To losses which are 
serious for such a small population, the Karabakh are filled 
with determination to respond with "adequate measures" for 
surviving and preserving their gene pool. 
  According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS [Civil 
Registrar's Office], at the end of May 1994 the birth 
rate--although continuing to lag behind the death rate--is 
already gradually overtaking the latter. Since 1 January, 404 
deaths have been registered (according to ZAGS Inspector Elmira 
Grigoryan, 90 percent of them perished at the front) and 320 
births. Whereas during the prewar years men in Karabakh used to 
marry--as a rule--after reaching the age of 24 or 25, nowadays 
they are marrying at much younger ages, i.e., 18 or even 17, so 
as to leave an heir behind before going off to the front. 
"Karabakhians have now come to understand that having 
traditionally small families with one or two children was our 
biggest mistake." So states Boris Arushanyan, first deputy 
chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers. "Every family should 
have a minimum of four or five children. The leaders of this 
republic are attempting to provide a personal example. For 
example, my youngest daughter is three months old, and the 
chairman of the NKR Supreme Soviet had a boy two and a half 
months ago. We understand that things will be hard for these 
children; those who are now two or three years old were mostly 
born and grew up in cellars under shelling and bombing. However, 
we must give life to a new generation of Karabakhians." 
  As noted by Mr. Arushanyan, the protectionist policy of the 
NKR leadership will proceed along two principal lines: one 
prohibitive and the other providing incentives. The former 
provides for introducing a ban on abortions in the NKR in the 
very near future. According to a law--the draft of which is now 
being considered and amended--it will clearly be forbidden for 
women under the age of 45 to have abortions, unless there are 
medical grounds. As to providing incentives for having many 
children, the government is introducing a system of benefits and 
creating privileged conditions. It will give families having 
three or more children considerable humanitarian assistance, to 
be obtained from charitable funds. 
  An unprecedented method of providing social protection for 
children who have been deprived of a breadwinner is the 
institution of "posthumous marriages"--an institution that has 
been officially legitimized in the NKR. By a special edict of 
the NKR State Committee for Defense it has been decreed that in 
the case of a soldier of the Karabakh Army living in a 
common-law type of marriage before leaving for the front but not 
getting around to registering this marriage, and in the event he 
is killed, his widow--on a court decision--may be recognized as 
such in full accordance with the law. Accordingly, she--together 
with the children of the deceased--may receive the appropriate 
pension. Moreover, such cases cannot be called isolated 
instances. According to data provided by the Stepanakert ZAGS, 
of the 173 marriages entered into since the beginning of this 
year, one out of every 10 has been "posthumous." 
  Measures have been undertaken to prevent the mass killing of 
children and youths during shelling and air raids. Specifically 
in connection with the April bombings by ground-attack aircraft 
of the Azerbaijani Air Force, secondary schools in Stepanakert 
were closed down for about a month. "We do not have enough 
children to risk having scores of them wiped out by a single 
bomb," the Karabakhians explain. Finally, attempts are being 
made to recall minors from combat units of the Karabakh Army of 
Defense. Whereas just a year ago the Army Staff Headquarters 
mentioned with pride a battalion made up entirely of 15- and 
16-year old volunteers fighting in the Mardakert Region, 
nowadays Major Murad Petrosyan, the chief of the Army's 
Political Section, assures us that it is strictly forbidden to 
accept youths under the age of 18 for service and that the Staff 
has ordered the Finance Unit to exclude all minors from the 
lists of combat units. 
  As of today, the exact number of Nagorno-Karabakh's 
inhabitants is unknown, but as a rule the approximate figure of 
150,000 persons is cited. Nor has there been an official report 
of the total number of losses suffered by the NKR during the 
years of the conflict (unofficial sources proceed on the basis 
that the number of persons killed among the civilian population 
as well as among the combatants amounts to something like 
5,000). Be that as it may, Boris Arushunyan, first deputy 
chairman of the NKR Council of Ministers, asserts the following: 
"The losses incurred by Nagorno-Karabakh during the years of the 
Great Patriotic War were much greater than they have been during 
the course of the present conflict. Therefore, even if we are 
now compelled to continue this war, I am confident that this 
will not bring our people to the brink of extinction."

<F P=106> [Interview with Rasul Bayram ogly Kuliyev, chairman of the </F>
Supreme Council, by Elmira Akhundova; place and date not given: 
"'We Need Peace and Radical Reforms'"] 
  [Text] As distinct from the previous speakers of 
parliament, he cannot be called an "office individual." He is 
actively involved in military organizational development and 
spends more time in the areas of combat operations than in 
parliament itself. Before he was elected to the office of 
chairman of the republic Supreme Council, he worked for a long 
time in industry and was in recent years head of a major Baku 
oil refinery. He is a practical expert and manager. A fierce 
supporter of the market. The main hope of Azerbaijan's 
businessmen and entrepreneurs. Today Rasul Bayram ogly Kuliyev 
is the main and most influential figure in Geydar Aliyev's team. 
He is interviewed by our correspondent Elmira Akhundova. 
  [Akhundova] The war, negotiations with the leaders of 
Armenia, economic reforms. Is not the plethora of duties getting 
in the way of your main activity--work as chairman of parliament? 
  [Kuliyev] I don't believe so. On the contrary, parliament is 
now working very productively. It is not, after all, a question 
of the number of bills that are adopted but of their qualitative 
level and their correspondence to the laws of civilized states. 
As far as the military questions are concerned, when it is a 
question of defense of the motherland, I am no longer speaker 
here but an ordinary citizen. I consider myself simply duty 
bound to go to the areas where combat operations are being 
conducted and resolve on the spot the problems that arise. 
Implementation of the economic reforms, on the other hand, is 
for me a most important question. We will acquire genuine 
independence only with the creation of a developed economy that 
operates, truly, according to market laws of economics. If, on 
the other hand, we continue to live and work according to the 
laws of the totalitarian system that held sway in the former 
USSR for many decades and that continue to exist in Azerbaijan 
to this day, we will never create an efficient economy and will 
constantly be on the verge of a loss of state independence, 
which we acquired with such difficulty and such sacrifices. I 
see as the purpose of my life and present activity in the office 
of speaker of parliament, therefore, the implementation of 
fundamental economic reforms. 
  [Akhundova] Unfortunately, there has been virtually no 
movement in the republic in this respect. What or who, in your 
opinion, is impeding the implementation of radical economic 
reforms in Azerbaijan? 
  [Kuliyev] The majority--80 percent--of the representatives 
of 
the state-bureaucratic nomenklatura that are in power at this 
moment do not at all represent the essence and meaning of the 
economic reforms. They are far from any market notions whatever. 
Had this been entrusted to me, I would not have ventured the 
implementation of economic reforms with them. I cannot say here 
that there are no personnel in Azerbaijan capable of tackling 
the urgent problems of the day. But they need to be sought among 
the incipient new growth of young, vigorous entrepreneurs, 
scientists, economists aged 30 to 40. They have made their 
presence felt in the past five or six years and have already in 
practice assimilated all the subtleties of the market economy, 
commerce, and so forth. These people should come to power. 
Personnel and personnel policy are the main and most important 
"painful" problem in Azerbaijan. A concept of the systemic 
restructuring of the organs of state administration has been put 
together in the republic at this time. But without 
professionally trained personnel, no concept, even the most 
dazzling, will do anything. The war, the need to liberate the 
occupied territory, the most complex political situation in the 
Caucasus as a whole--all this is having a negative effect on 
internal processes in the republic and fettering our actions. 
But I believe that the coming month will be a turning point in 
this respect. Generally, if you want to know my opinion, I am a 
supporter of shock therapy and of the broad and instantaneous 
introduction in the republic's economic organism of the 
processes of denationalization and privatization. Strenuous work 
on the creation of a package of laws that would make it possible 
to embark on the accomplishment of this task is being performed 
in parliament at this time. 
  [Akhundova] What is happening today on the 
Armenian-Azerbaijani front? Despite the fact that the 
Azerbaijani Army has managed to halt the advance of the Armenian 
formations deep into Azerbaijani territory, it has scored no 
appreciable successes. Are such significant losses justified? 
Perhaps the path of peace negotiations would bring the two sides 
more rapidly to the desired goal? 
  [Kuliyev] We have never rejected the path of negotiations, 
the peaceful path. Yes, the negotiating process is proving 
difficult, and finding a mutually acceptable version is very 
hard--too much blood has been spilled, there is too much mutual 
distrust in the parties to the conflict. But there is no 
alternative: Continued military confrontation is fraught with 
mass new casualties and the final exhaustion of the physical and 
moral resources of the two peoples. It is for this reason, I 
believe, that I did right to append my signature to the Bishkek 
Protocol, recording Azerbaijan's good will and its readiness for 
a long-term cease-fire and political negotiations. 
  [Akhundova] This protocol has evoked a stormy reaction in 
Azerbaijan. The opposition has for about a month been using your 
name every which way, and the most irreconcilable have even 
accused you of a betrayal of national interests and have 
demanded your resignation. The main charges amount to the 
following: First, in having appended your signature alongside 
that of the representative of the Armenian community of Nagornyy 
Karabakh you de jure recognized the self-proclaimed Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh and, second, your signature gave the "go-ahead" 
for the version of a settlement of the conflict within the 
framework of the CIS and the deployment of a Russian military 
contingent on the territory of Azerbaijan. 
  [Kuliyev] I consider all these charges a malicious invention 
of the destabilizing forces in the republic that have for 
several years now been playing the "Karabakh card" in the turbid 
water of political commotion and populist speculation in their 
endeavor to come to power. No one in the world, not even Armenia 
itself, has recognized the so-called Republic of 
Nagorno-Karabakh. At the same time, on the other hand, we need, 
finally, to recognize the current realities: A war is being 
fought on the territory of Azerbaijan, and Nagornyy Karabakh is 
a party to the conflict. As far as the question of the plan of a 
settlement of the conflict that is preferable for Azerbaijan is 
concerned, there is a good opportunity, I believe, for combining 
two plans--the Russian plan and the one proposed by the 
international community in the shape of the CSCE and its Minsk 
Group. There is one "but" here.... If peace is offered 
Azerbaijan on shameful terms, I want no part of the conclusion 
of this peace. The main thing is that the four UN Security 
Council resolutions must be fulfilled and all the occupied 
territory of our republic unconditionally liberated. All other 
questions may be decided in the process of political 
negotiations. And I disagree, incidentally, with your assertion 
that we have scored no military successes. We have advanced 
along the entire perimeter of the front from 5 to 50 km. And 
this in just two months. Yes, we have sustained certain losses, 
but I am not afraid to say that we have to pay in blood for the 
liberation of our territory. 
  [Akhundova] And how do you view the idea of the commitment 
to 
the conflict zone of a peacekeeping force, primarily Russian? 
  [Kuliyev] The leadership of Azerbaijan is a supporter of 
peacekeeping actions by the forces of international observers. 
Since there is a need for the commitment to the conflict zone of 
a disengagement force, let it be composed of representatives of 
a mixed contingent, not just Russia. The leaders of leading 
Western states that are participants in the CSCE's Minsk Group 
agree with us on this issue. I am generally an opponent in 
principle of the deployment of the armed forces of Russia or any 
other state on the territory of Azerbaijan, of the creation of 
military bases here even more. This would infringe the 
republic's national sovereignty to this extent or the other. 
Russia and Azerbaijan should, in my opinion, strive for the 
consolidation and revival of the common economic and cultural 
space, but by no means for political or, even less, military 
dependence on one another. I spoke about this in the course of 
my recent visit to Moscow and am pleased that my position 
encountered understanding among the leaders of the Russian state. 
  [Akhundova] Your forecast as to how events will develop in 
the coming months in the political, economic, and military 
spheres? 
  [Kuliyev] Much will depend, of course, on the foreign policy 
macro-situation. Unless something unexpected happens, we will 
embark on radical economic reforms in the very near future. We 
can no longer delay--we could find ourselves hopelessly behind. 
Unless we resolve the problem of Nagornyy Karabakh peacefully, 
we shall continue to liberate our land. True, I greatly hope 
that the Armenian side and the leaders of the neighboring 
republic will finally understand that the path of confrontation 
and continued military opposition will bring them nothing. 
Armenia is in a most difficult situation. With the help of the 
overseas diaspora and foreign injections it may hold on for some 
length of time, even score a number of military successes, but 
this will not last long. 
  Our political strategy? We must show the world community 
that 
we are truly building a civilized state. After all, however much 
we praise ourselves, we are still a long way from a truly 
democratic, civilized society. So there is an abundance of work 
to be done.

<F P=106> [AZERTADZH correspondent's report: "Curbing Inflation Is the </F>
Main Goal"] 
  [Text] Baku, 17 June--The increase in the minimum wage and 
the price of bread and energy specified by the edict of the 
president of Azerbaijan on measures pertaining to the social 
protection of the populace and the financial stabilization of 
the economy will not signify a sharp spurt in inflation and a 
decline in the living standard. This was stated at a news 
conference held yesterday by Vakhid Akhundov, state counselor of 
the republic for economic policy. 
  V. Akhundov termed the present increase in the price of 
bread 
and energy extremely necessary. According to him, this will make 
it possible not only to reduce their intensive exportation from 
the republic--that had been stimulated by the unjustifiably low 
prices of these products--but also to evoke a more solicitous 
attitude toward them. In addition, the increase in the price of 
bread will make it possible to reduce government subsidies by 
almost one-third and also to eliminate the strain that has 
occurred recently in the provision of the society with bread 
products. The increase in the cost of oil, on the other hand, on 
which the oil workers have long been insisting, will permit a 
recovery of the financial state of the oil-producing sector, 
which is the basis of the economy of the whole country and the 
main source of its currency receipts. 
  As the state counselor announced, the funds derived from the 
price increase will be spent on sums of compensation for the 
needy strata of the populace, which are already being paid. 
  Answering journalists' questions, he observed that the 
measures specified by the presidential edict pertaining, 
specifically, to a tightening in the republic of credit policy 
would make it possible to avoid another spurt in inflation, 
which usually accompanies a price hike. The current turmoil 
here, expressed in the uncontrolled issue of credit unsupported 
by real monetary resources, had become a factor of the growth of 
inflation, a deterioration in the financial state of the 
country, and a steep decline in the living standard of society. 
As V. Akhundov reported, as of the present time the republic's 
banks have issued 20-30 million manat over and above available 
resources. The cancellation of interbranch turnover (MFO) and 
the introduction of a system of correspondent accounts 
signifying control of credit resources on the part of the 
National Bank will make it possible to eliminate this negative 
phenomenon. According to the state counselor, this was the main 
condition set for Azerbaijan by the IMF, the World Bank, and 
other international financial organizations. 
  The recuperation of finances will be aided also by a 
tightening of control of the repayment of loans, an end to the 
funding of facilities of incomplete construction, except for 
those nearing completion, and the sale of some of these 
facilities to private investors. As V. Akhundov maintained, the 
precise fulfillment of these and other measures specified by the 
edict will have made it possible by the end of the year to have 
considerably reduced inflation, whose level currently 
constitutes 30 percent a month.

<F P=106> [G. Akhmedov report: "Factor of Development--the Market: </F>
Word of the Organizers of a New Party"] 
  [Text] Fuad Asadov, president of the Union of 
Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs, delivered a statement at a news 
conference. He announced that a congress of members of his union 
had been held at the end of May. It had decided on the creation 
of a new political organization--the Azerbaijan Republic Reform 
Party (ARRP). 
  The action committee formed an organizing committee, 
which commissioned Fuad Asadov to hold a news conference and 
describe the business and tasks of the party that is being 
formed. 
  Journalists of republic newspapers and agencies--BAKINSKIY 
RABOCHIY, VYSHKA, RESPUBLIKA, MILLYAT, ADALYAT, EKHO SUMGAITA, 
ASSA-IRADA, ANS-PRESS, and others--displayed great interest. The 
party is being formed on the basis of the Union of Leaseholders 
and Entrepreneurs. Several years ago its members were the first 
to embark on the transformation of Azerbaijan's industry and 
agriculture on a market basis--to create leased and small 
enterprises, cooperatives, stock companies, and private farms. 
  Of course, things were difficult for them, and some of them 
had their fill of hard times. Had it not been for the decisive 
actions of the leaders of the union, who vigorously defended the 
rights of the leased collectives in the court of arbitration, 
and their protests in the press and on radio and television, it 
would hardly have been possible to preserve their market 
structure status. For example, Edison Akhundov, director of the 
Remdetal small enterprise, went to law six times with the 
leadership of the Automotive Trust of the Ministry of 
Agriculture, and justice was ultimately restored. And the 
leadership of the State Committee for Sport attempted with a 
squad of police officers to induce Maya Ismaylova, general 
director of the Ilman leased production association, to hand 
over her files. The workforce stood solidly behind her and the 
Supreme Court of Arbitration rejected the plaintiff's unlawful 
importunings. 
  The Union of Leaseholders and Entrepreneurs in fact became 
the public defender of all who aspired to switch to market 
relations. Together with the News Media Workers Union Republic 
Committee it conducted a competition under the motto "For the 
economic revival of Azerbaijan." Many newspaper, journalist, 
economist, and scientist winners were awarded valuable gifts and 
cash prizes. The union is participating actively in law-making 
activity of the republic Supreme Council. 
  Its leaders have now embarked a new difficult venture--the 
organization of a party. According to Fuad Asadov's statement, 
the main factor of Azerbaijan's development and its emergence 
from the crisis is the market economy. But the brakes have been 
applied to the switch of the national economy to the tracks of 
the latter, and it is proceeding only middling well, as they 
say. This situation can no longer be tolerated. The main reason 
for the running in place is the absence of a set of laws on the 
market economy. The entrepreneurs are bound hand and foot 
because of this, which is preventing them from investing their 
forces, knowledge, and talent in production in full. To achieve 
their goals, the entrepreneurs are forced today to bow to 
government, ministerial, and customs officials, yet what is 
necessary is that all be subordinate to and depend only on laws 
regulating economic and social life. The current chaos and 
turmoil and the absence of prescriptive documents are creating 
conditions for endless and prejudiced inspections by 
representatives of the prosecutor's office, the police, 
financial and tax authorities.... 
  A principal task, whose accomplishment the new party will 
tackle first and foremost, is an acceleration of the adoption of 
laws regulating and organizing the economy in a new way, 
remembering here the classical expression: policy is the 
concentrated expression of the economy. 
  Of course, the ARRP will fight also for people's social 
rights, and it has other goals also. To journalists' questions 
as to whether the party would aspire to seize power, it was 
stated that such was not its mission. 
  Any citizen of Azerbaijan may, without distinction as to 
national origin or religious belief, become a member of the 
party. Group membership of enterprise and organization workers 
also is permitted. 
  The ARRP urges Azerbaijan's development along the path of 
democracy, civilization, independence, and liberty. It rejects 
extremism and violence aimed at the overthrow of the current 
system and supports the efforts of the president of the republic 
for a political solution of the Karabakh conflict and his 
efforts to stabilize society. The ARRP Organizing Committee 
points to the danger of inaction and indifference and calls on 
the citizens for unity, active struggle against internal discord 
and the dirty games of various political forces, and unification 
for the sake of the prosperity of their native Azerbaijan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Elsavar Ibragimov, head of executive power </F>
of the city of Gyandzha, by Vagif Abdullayev; place and date not 
given: "The Difficult Daily Routines of Gyandzha"] 
  [Text] Gyandzha, the second largest city of our 
republic in terms of size and industrial potential, is facing 
difficult times. A catastrophic fall in production, a large 
"hole" in the local budget, a complex crime situation, and the 
low incomes of the city folk hamper the accomplishment of many 
social and economic tasks. The situation is exacerbated by the 
fact that the supply of basic necessities--meat, butter, sugar, 
and even bread--in the city is as bad as it gets. This is no 
longer about obtaining merchandise with monthly ration cards, 
but about supplies to so-called closed institutions as well. 
Without exaggeration, many day-care centers and boarding schools 
are almost on starvation rations. Under these difficult 
circumstances, moral and material aid should also be provided to 
350 families of martyrs and more than 30,000 refugees. 
  There is one more difficulty. It is found in the fact 
that the desire to do as much as possible is not matched by the 
financial and economic potential and runs into the absence of 
clear-cut laws in the sphere of the economy and the banking 
system. 
  How do the city authorities operate under such complex 
conditions? What is their vision of solutions to the most 
painful problems of the city's economy? Elsavar Ibragimov, the 
head of executive power of the city of Gyandzha, discusses this. 
Incidentally, let us note that he is the fifth person to hold 
this vital position in the last two years. 
  [Ibragimov] When this office was entrusted to me in November 
last year, many people were interested to know whether I had a 
specific program for economic and social recovery in Gyandzha. 
Of course, there should be an element of planning in the work. 
This is certain. Unfortunately, in the last two to three years 
the condition of the city had become so lamentable that it was 
not easy to decide what to undertake first. There were problems 
with bread, gasoline, gas, and electricity; there was a shortage 
of cash in banks.... On top of everything, the crime situation 
has also become aggravated. Against the background of these 
unfavorable phenomena, certain forces have repeatedly attempted 
to disrupt the operation of the industrial sector and to 
discredit state authorities. 
  We recall the nightmare of last winter and our powerlessness 
to do anything in response to a never-ending stream of 
complaints about the absence of gas. They began to use 
electricity everywhere to heat apartments. As a result, 
overloads caused 42 substations to burn out. In turn, without 
the substations it was impossible to provide drinking water from 
artesian wells. In a word, conditions were those of a city under 
siege. 
  Everything possible was done in order to mitigate the 
situation. Despite their internal difficulties, many enterprises 
and organizations provided assistance to the city at that time. 
  [Abdullayev] As we recall, that time was difficult for the 
residents of Gyandzha indeed. However, as we can see, the 
situation has more or less stabilized. We would like to know 
what the priorities are in the operation of the executive 
authorities at present. 
  [Ibragimov] Locally, be it in a city or rayon, the operation 
of the authorities is rated on how good the supply of bread and 
water to the people is, what condition the roads are in, how 
urban transit operates, and how effective crime-control measures 
are. In the process, they entirely lose sight of the economy. I 
know that it will appear strange, but a majority of the 
residents of Gyandzha for some reason do not see that the city's 
facilities are dependent on how the industrial potential is 
used. It is no secret that the severance of economic relations 
and the introduction of national currencies in all former Soviet 
republics have paralyzed all industries almost everywhere. 
Certainly, Gyandzha is no exception on this score, either. 
Suffice it to mention that the decline in the volume of 
production since the beginning of this year comes to 20 percent 
of the corresponding period of 1993. As we can see, the causes 
are objective in nature in this case. It is understandable why 
we are not in a position to eliminate them with our own 
resources. For this reason, we focused our attention on areas of 
the development of the urban economy which are feasible for us; 
these are the roads, water supply, sewers, transportation. 
Incidentally, at one time large funds were assigned for these 
purposes. However, very little was actually done. There are no 
such centralized receipts now. However, the demand of the 
population for such services has, on the contrary, increased. 
Suffice it to say that one-quarter of the city does not have 
sewers; the water supply also leaves a lot to be desired. 
  [Abdullayev] You said that at one time sizable funds were 
allocated to meet the needs of the city, and even stressed that 
this was done on a centralized basis. Clearly, all this is a 
matter of the past. Everything now depends on the potential of 
the city treasury.... 
  [Ibragimov] I will say right away that it is being 
replenished with difficulty. Thus, in 1994 the expenditure side 
of the budget comes to 3 billion manats, whereas the revenue 
side is one-half that amount. Therefore, the budget deficit is 
set at 1.5 billion manats from the outset. This is why we are 
forced to take out a loan. Recently, we wheedled out 150 million 
manats from the Ministry of Finance of the republic. We received 
slightly more than this amount from that same Ministry of 
Finance last year. Living on credit has already become something 
of a norm. Opportunities for an infusion into the budget will 
remain quite modest until we succeed in substantially raising 
the effectiveness of the national economy. 
  Some see a way out in raising taxes, floating internal and 
external loans, and currency emission. However, this is not the 
way. Incidentally, I cannot but recall the high tax rates on 
commercial space which were introduced a few weeks ago. In 
essence, this is a tax on empty counters. As a result, the 
stores divided their sales floors into two parts. One of the 
halves is supposedly assigned for storage. Many stores in 
Gyandzha have become quite ugly because of this. Yet this could 
have been foreseen had they been aware that the condition of the 
state trade sector is now lamentable. 
  Unfortunately, we appear to have forgotten that all of 80 
percent of the budget, at any rate in Gyandzha, is replenished 
by contributions from the profits of industrial enterprises. So, 
if they functioned the way they did before, there would be no 
problems at all. However, as we can see, industry turned out to 
be powerless in the face of the disintegration of the unified 
economic mechanism on which the economy of the Soviet period was 
based. 
  [Abdullayev] In a word, it so happens that now it is 
difficult to hope for the implementation of particular large 
economic projects. To your mind, is there a way out of this 
financial impasse? After all, there are times when you cannot 
get loans. Besides, on occasion it is very hard to pay them back. 
  [Ibragimov] We understand this full well. I admit that the 
money received goes into a bottomless pit--this is how expensive 
everything has now become. For example, we recently spent 70 
million manats we had obtained on credit just to cosmetically 
repair the roads. You would agree that under the circumstances 
it would be best to use internal reserves. This is what we are 
doing. Thus, we began, on a contractual basis, the construction 
of a shopping area in which 44 small stores will be located. 
Construction was done by a special construction and repair trust 
reporting to the city executive authorities, with funding being 
used from both legal entities and individuals. This made it 
possible to contribute more than 27 million manats to the 
treasury. Later, these funds were used to restore a 4 
kilometer-long water main as well as sewers within the city 
limits. In a word, we saved a lot of funds. This is point one. 
Second, a work opportunity was provided for the special repair 
and construction trust whose financial situation was difficult. 
  The search for internal reserves continues. We have several 
developed projects whose effectiveness has been evaluated. The 
construction of single-family houses, the sale of unfinished 
apartments in standard high-rise buildings to the population, 
and other measures. We want to thus draw housing and land 
allocated for houses and dachas into circulation on the market. 
Later, it will be possible to also sell small state enterprises, 
especially ones that are unprofitable. 
  However, these are all forced measures. How are we to 
proceed 
otherwise if the funds taken in by the budget make it possible 
to pay only 60 percent of the wages in organizations financed 
from the budget? We have to compensate for the lacking 40 
percent through loans. Unfortunately, as I see it, the people in 
Gyandzha, like those in other regions, do not always have a 
clear notion of the processes that are underway. They forget 
that previously the enterprises of the republic operated at full 
capacity. At present, many plants and combines in Gyandzha and 
everywhere else are on the brink of shutting down production. 
  [Abdullayev] Actually, this is easy to conclude based on the 
fact that many locally produced goods, even basic ones, have 
disappeared from store shelves. 
  [Ibragimov] The trouble is that a catastrophic slump in 
production has been registered not only in Gyandzha but 
everywhere. This is not to justify our local shortcomings. There 
is no dearth of those. Suffice it to say that compared to the 
corresponding period of last year, the decline in production in 
the first two months of this year comes to five tonnes for 
butter, 248 tonnes for dairy products, 720 tonnes for laundry 
soap, and 242 tonnes for meat and meat products. Some 110,000 
fewer square meters of carpet and carpet products and 296,000 
fewer pieces of porcelain products were produced. The list goes 
on. How are we to reverse the situation? We think that it is 
necessary to either undertake reorientation of industries or 
perfect the banking system. It is not ruled out that other 
constructive ways out of the impasse exist. Who should show the 
initiative? Primarily, reorganization of the industrial sector 
is at issue. So far, market reforms have not affected it at all. 
This is how it happens that the ministries should act as 
helmsmen. However, the ministries work on anything at all except 
production. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture responded 
with absolute calm to a stoppage at enterprises in Gyandzha such 
as the confectionery plant, the meat combine, and the dairy 
combine. The same situation has emerged with the production of 
industrially manufactured construction materials. The management 
of the industry is unconcerned about the fact that finished 
products worth billions of manats have accumulated at the 
alumina combine. The same is the case at the instrument-making 
plant. 
  I will say this: The countless army of ministerial officials 
is of no use at all. Yet, they are good at harming all 
endeavors. I will give the following example. By a decree of the 
Cabinet of Ministers, the executive authorities of Gyandzha were 
authorized to dispose of 15 percent of the products manufactured 
at the enterprises of the city. We could bring in to Gyandzha 
many types of foodstuffs through barter transactions by taking 
advantage of this right. However, the ministries demand that we 
prepay the proportion of products which we could dispose of, but 
we do not have funds for these purposes "ahead of time." Our 
appeals to the heads of departments asking that they themselves 
provide foodstuffs to at least the day-care centers and 
hospitals reporting to them likewise produce no results. A 
vicious circle emerges. The answer is found in shortages, in the 
striving to make money off them, make it in any way possible. 
For example, overstocked warehouses at wineries, incidentally 
not only in Gyandzha, testify to this. 
  One cannot help getting the impression that such an economic 
situation suits some people. 
  [Abdullayev] How does the community of directors respond to 
this? 
  [Ibragimov] It tries to avoid mass unemployment. For our 
part, we support in every way possible all initiatives of 
enterprise managers aimed at offering new jobs and becoming 
self-sufficient in at least the basic necessities. 
  We also encourage the development of entrepreneurship and 
small businesses. These forms of activity that are new to us 
make it possible to provide jobs for many residents of Gyandzha. 
Suffice it to say that about 6,000 people work at small 
enterprises and in associations. 
  [Abdullayev] As we know, a slump in production, deficit, and 
inflation are always accompanied by mounting crime-generating 
tensions. We would expect that not everything is favorable on 
this score in Gyandzha, too. 
  [Ibragimov] You know, even earlier our city was one of the 
hot spots on the criminal map of the republic. The motives for 
and nature of crimes have now changed in a way. First, organized 
crime dominates. Second, if I can put it so, criminal entities 
have begun to penetrate industrial facilities, commercial 
structures, and banks. Moreover, they frequently attempt to 
control the activities of local authorities in the area of 
personnel selection. There are things for us to think over in 
this area. As is known, in the West organized crime controls 
only the criminal sectors of activity, such as prostitution, the 
drug trade, and gambling. In turn, our organized crime controls 
virtually all types of activities. This is associated with the 
fact that for a number of objective reasons, many facilities 
have in a way become criminal themselves. For example, in the 
environment of the severance of economic relations and absolute 
shortages, many enterprise managers are forced to resort to 
illegal means in order to obtain the resources necessary to 
fulfill production plans. This is how the initial knots of 
corruption are tied. Honest people also get caught in its nets 
against their will. For example, how are they to avoid the 
so-called "payola" which has become the norm when final products 
are sold? What kind of measures can one take given that the 
criminal elements intertwine with police organs and officials of 
all ranks? It is no secret that such intertwining endangers the 
political and economic development of our republic as a whole. 
  In Gyandzha we are particularly concerned about the growth 
in 
grave crimes. In the last 1.5 years alone, 83 premeditated 
murders were committed. Most of them occurred last year when 
many firearms were "making the rounds" in private hands. Owing 
to the measures taken, bursts of automatic weapon fire are no 
longer heard at night, but based on certain facts we can 
conclude that by far not all of the weapons have been 
confiscated. 
  [Abdullayev] However, the executive authorities are also 
responsible for order in the city.... 
  [Ibragimov] Certainly. However, we are frequently at odds 
with the leadership of the republic's Ministry of Internal 
Affairs. Thus, a few months ago the chief of airport police was 
relieved from his position by a decision of the city executive 
authorities. However, our petition on this issue still remains 
"unresponded to"--pardon me for unintended bureaucratese. All of 
this causes various false rumors. The most terrifying thing is 
that people lose their belief in justice. 
  [Abdullayev] As is known, progress in society as a whole 
largely depends on the welfare of all regions. This begs the 
question.... 
  [Ibragimov] I understand. I think I will be expressing 
everybody's opinion if I say that we first of all need to put an 
end to the war by political means. It claims many human lives. 
In Gyandzha alone 350 families are in mourning; tens of 
thousands of refugees are in a hopeless situation. Putting it 
plainly, people are just tired. The republic budget is not 
standing up to the war, either. For this reason the citizens of 
Gyandzha, like an overwhelming majority of Azeris, entirely 
support the peace-loving policy of the president of our 
republic. Of course, we understand that not everything will fall 
into place, and not right away. However, we believe that even a 
bad peace will make it possible to refocus our attention on the 
implementation of reforms and the economic revival of Azerbaijan. 
  [Abdullayev] We second your hopes. Thank you for the 
interview.

<F P=106> [Republic of Azerbaijan presidential edict: "Measures To </F>
Increase Social Protection of the Population and Financial 
Stabilization of the Economy"] 
  [Text] The increase in inflation and the decline in 
production have led in recent times to a lowering of the living 
standard of society and have exerted a negative influence on the 
financial state of the republic. This has been connected to a 
decisive extent with the inefficient use of the financial and 
credit resources of public enterprises and organizations, the 
unjustified increase in their crossover into nonstate 
structures, and the absence of precise mechanisms of the pursuit 
of a price policy and the regulation of wages and the currency 
market. All this is creating difficulties for the implementation 
of the program of market transformations and bringing about a 
growth of socioeconomic tension. 
  To increase social protection of the population and ensure 
financial stabilization of the economy I resolve: 
  1. To establish as of 1 June 1994 minimum remuneration at 
2,000 manat a month. 
  2. To appoint as of 1 June 1994 for social and nonworking 
retirees, students of day courses at higher educational 
institutions, and trainees of technical schools and 
vocational-technical schools monetary compensation amounting to 
1,500 manat, and for families with a per capita monthly income 
of less than the minimum wage times two, monetary compensation 
amounting to 750 manat a month per child 16 years of age and 
under. These sums of compensation shall be paid from the 
resources of the republic budget. 
  To consider lapsed in this connection the Republic of 
Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 "Payment of 
Compensation to Nonworking Retirees" and clause two of Republic 
of Azerbaijan presidential edict of 22 November 1993 
"Supplementary Measures in the Field of Regulation of the Price 
of Bread and Bakery Products and Increased Social Protection for 
the Needy Strata of the Populace." 
  3. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers 
shall 
implement the following system of anti-inflation measures to 
ensure financial stabilization in the economy: 
  as of 16 June 1994, increase the prices of energy and bread 
and hence forward review them not less than quarterly with 
regard to the rate of inflation; 
  within three days' time, make the corresponding changes, 
based on coordinated proposals of the Ministry of Finance and 
the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of the Populace, to 
the uniform wage scale for workers and employees to prevent the 
formation of an appreciable gap between the remuneration of 
employees of the low-income and high-income categories; 
  prior to the end of 1994, suspend the construction of 
facilities financed from funds of the republic budget, except 
for projects of the current year that are close to completion, 
and adopt measures to ensure the safe preservation of these 
facilities; 
  reverse the decisions it adopted earlier on public 
enterprises being granted soft loans; 
  in interaction with the banks, adopt measures to ensure the 
public enterprises' repayment of credit within the established 
timeframe; 
  within two weeks' time, present proposals for the 
reorganization of the structure of the central organs of state 
administration in the direction of a reduction in their numbers 
and also a downsizing of staff and administrative-managerial 
costs, thanks to a reduction in the number of official motor 
vehicles included; 
  within 10 days' time, devise rules for the allocation of the 
resources of public enterprises and organizations on charitable 
purposes and introduce a precise mechanism of supervision to 
ensure that these resources be used as specifically intended; 
  within 10 days' time, confirm the maximum rate of use of the 
profits of public enterprises and organizations for wages; 
  in the necessary quantity to partially cover the budget 
deficit, provide for the manufacture and sale of government 
securities; 
  within a month's time, prepare and present proposals 
concerning a transition from the system of tax and nontax 
privileges for particular categories of individuals and legal 
entities to a system of monetary compensation for the socially 
unprotected strata of the populace; 
  ensure strict compliance with legislation on the 
registration 
and issue of a certificate to higher and secondary specialized 
educational institutions and adopt the necessary measures aimed 
at a reduction in the admittance of trainees to 
vocational-technical schools and of students to evening and 
correspondence departments of higher educational institutions 
funded from the state budget; 
  within a month's time, devise and present for consideration 
by the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan a concept for 
transition to insurance medicine and also proposals pertaining 
to its legal support. 
  4. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Economics and 
the State Committee for Antitrust Policy and the Support of 
Enterprise shall intensify supervision of the formation of 
prices at public enterprises that are monopolies and 
systematically present to the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers information on enterprises permitting a deviation from 
the market prices of the products (services) they manufacture 
(provide). 
  That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers shall 
adopt stringent measures against enterprise executives 
permitting such a deviation. 
  5. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance 
shall: 
  within a month's time conduct an audit of the resources of 
public enterprises and organizations diverted into founder's and 
other contributions to the nonstate sector of the economy. 
  That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers shall 
provide for the adoption of specific measures for the more 
efficient use of these resources; 
  provide for the precise delineation of the republic and 
local 
budgets, broadening the independence of the local budgets with 
regard to the fuller use of levers of their formation; 
  with regard to inflation review quarterly in conjunction 
with 
the Main State Tax Inspectorate of the Republic of Azerbaijan 
the treasury tax receipt targets. 
  6. To propose that the National Bank of the Republic of 
Azerbaijan: 
  tighten the reserve requirements in respect to 
joint-stock-commercial and commercial banks and, with regard to 
the rate of growth of inflation, review quarterly the discount 
rate on centralized credit resources; 
  disallow the practice of the mutual off-setting of arrears 
between enterprises and organizations; 
  implement measures to terminate lending to enterprises and 
organizations with foreign currency assets; 
  adopt all measures to ensure the stabilization of the 
exchange rate of the manat and the regular operation of the Baku 
Interbank Currency Exchange. For this purpose authorize the 
National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan, following 
consultation with the president of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 
to use resources of the Stabilization Fund for restrained 
intervention in the interbank currency market; 
  provide in conjunction with the joint-stock-commercial 
agro-industrial and industrial-investment banks for their 
transition as of 1 July 1994 to a system of correspondent 
accounts to prevent the issue of credit not backed by resources; 
  adopt in conjunction with the Republic of Azerbaijan 
Ministry 
of Economics, the Republic of Azerbaijan Ministry of Finance, 
and the Republic of Azerbaijan Main State Tax Inspectorate 
measures to stabilize monetary circulation and reduce money 
issue by means of the establishment of a stimulatory deposit 
interest rate and regulation of the activity of the commercial 
sector in the sphere of monetary circulation. 
  7. For an increase in the efficiency of the use of public 
financial resources to propose that public enterprises and 
organizations switch to full credit-payment and cash service in 
joint-stock-commercial banks whose controlling block of shares 
is publicly owned. That the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers shall implement urgent measures in this sphere. 
  8. To propose that the Republic of Azerbaijan National 
Assembly speed up the confirmation of the guidelines of the 
credit policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 1994 and the 
official program of privatization as an important means of 
economic and financial stabilization and the adoption of a law 
on property and other legislative instruments ensuring a legal 
basis for the transition to a market economy. 
  9. To commission the Republic of Azerbaijan Cabinet of 
Ministers and the Republic of Azerbaijan National Bank with 
presenting the Republic of Azerbaijan president with information 
monthly on execution of this edict.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilgonis Upmalis, Chief of the Bureau to </F>
Control the Withdrawal of the Army of the Federation of Russia, 
and Ludis Pavilonis, his deputy, by Viktors Berzins: "They 
leave. Facilities remain; The Russian army is leaving so briskly 
that the Latvian state cannot keep up with resolutions on the 
former army facilities."] 
  [Text] In summary, the number of resolutions by the 
government, which would determine the future ownership of the 
facilities, is unable to keep up with the number of acceptance 
and committal acts. 
  [Pavilonis] During its time, the Supreme Council passed a 
resolution stating that the Council of Ministers must review the 
case of each such facility and adopt a resolution on awarding it 
to either the municipality or some other party, all within a ten 
day period. 
  In practice, this cannot be done because the process takes 
too long. Before the Cabinet of Ministers adopts the resolution, 
the resolution bill must be written, in conjunction with the 
judicial division and other institutions. In total, about 10 to 
15 signatures must be collected. When these and the archival 
reports are gathered, the case is reviewed by the appropriate 
committee of the Cabinet of Ministers, and if the latter finds 
that all of the documentation is in order, only then is it 
presented to the administration. In a meeting of the 
administration, the final resolution is adopted on the 
disposition of the facility. 
  [Berzins] Then a whole month would go by ... 
  [Pavilonis] Ye-es (drawing out the word)... You said one 
month? Now let's take a look at the list of facilities returned. 
For example, Cesis rayon, Sarkani, medical warehouses. Committal 
act -- April 27, 1993. Administrative resolution -- March 5, 
1994. Almost one entire year! Naturally, it doesn't take this 
long for everything. Now, here is another entry: committal act 
-- June 8, 1993, resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers -- 
January 4, 1994. Half of a year. And there are more and more. 
  [Berzins] At such a rate, we will never get rid of the 
Russian army! 
  [Pavilonis] We are getting rid of the Russian army, because 
they are no longer in these facilities. The army says "so long" 
to those areas as soon as there is an acceptance and committal 
act. 
  [Berzins] What happens to the vacated facility during the 
time between the committal act and the adoption of the 
administrative resolution? 
  [Pavilonis] The municipality must provide protection to make 
sure that nothing happens, but it is not allowed to take over 
ownership. It cannot allow in a private organization, nor do 
anything else. 
  And what happens if the municipality has agreed to be the 
owner, but then some interested ministry turns up, which decides 
something as follows: Why should the municipality have it? We 
need it! We will turn it over to the municipality, then prepare 
a resolution to have it turned over to us. And they prepare and 
receive the resolution by the Cabinet of Ministers. Now the 
occupant selected by the municipality must be evicted. Can the 
municipality feel secure and confident: Although the Cabinet of 
Ministers is preparing these resolutions very slowly, they will 
be finished someday, and then -- who will be the legal owner of 
the facility? There have been numerous precedents where the 
facility has been taken away from the municipality. 
  Now about protection. The municipalities are not paid for 
providing protection, and they must find the money from internal 
reserves. But, when the municipality is turned out of some 
facility, it says: -- We are removing our protection, but pay us 
for the period during which we provided protection. -- But the 
ministries, in turn, have no money, and so they just don't pay. 
  [Berzins] What should be done to speed up the disposition of 
the former military facilities? 
  [Pavilonis] At the least, we should increase the number of 
members in the Ministry of Finances group that prepares the 
administrative resolution bills, so that we can catch up with 
the acceptance and committal acts. Naturally, this is impossible 
to do in ten days, since signatures cannot be obtained at such a 
rate, but let them attempt to do it in twenty days. Don't 
prolong it to a year. 
  [Upmalis] The next meeting of the commission led by Mr. 
Kosisis will be dedicated to a discussion on how to speed up 
production of these administrative resolutions. 
  In order to adopt a resolution, which will have a completely 
singular significance for the commission, and the 
administration, and so that there will be no basis for an 
argument by any entity, there must be clarity on what is under 
each facility; who owned the land? Has the owner submitted a 
claim? Who owned the facility built before 1940? All of this 
archival information is essential. Plus, we need the plans of 
the building or facility. In the beginning, while the military 
unit was still in there, they were impossible to obtain. Now, we 
have made an agreement with North West Military Group Commander 
Mayorov, and there are no longer any refusals. We even received 
them for the Maiznicas Street facility, which contains the 
counter-intelligence unit. It is a complicated matter to gather 
all of the archival information, to obtain the necessary 
documents from the Land and Property Reclamation commissions. 
  If it is absolutely certain that the land under a facility 
belongs to the municipality, then, naturally, the facility 
belongs to the municipality. If a mistake is made at the meeting 
of the administration, then this could lead to the curious event 
that the administration, by its resolution, gives the 
municipality's land to some ministry. Mistakes happen, many 
mistakes -- because incomplete documentation is submitted. 
  Commercial organizations are very quick in using this to 
their advantage when they are interested in a certain facility. 
As you could say, they climb over corpses, with the help of 
false information, with various incomplete reports, to attempt 
and sometimes even succeed to establish the grounds for their 
claim. Municipalities are also guilty. And there are cases where 
all of the interested parties do not want to settle their claims 
in accordance with the law, and then the only way to clear up 
the confusion is by the prosecutor and the court. 
  There will be a "mad dash", there will. 
  [Berzins] Let us assume that the Russian army will leave by 
August 31. The majority of military units will probably prolong 
the turnover of the facilities as long as they can. The "mad 
dash", presumably, will occur in July and August... 
  [Pavilonis] Maybe there will be much more of a "mad dash" 
towards the end, but I can say that at present they are turning 
over their facilities on a somewhat regular basis. As soon as an 
area is empty, they draw up the acceptance and committal act: 
please, take it and do what you will. It is no longer the way it 
was at one time, -- major discord: Mayorov was not signing the 
acts, Moscow was simply not allowing him to sign -- the military 
unit area was empty, but it was not turned over. Now these 
matters are being handled promptly. 
  [Berzins] There is probably still a great deal left to 
settle. 
  [Pavilonis] Yes. There are still 191 Russian army units in 
247 facilities in Latvia. 
  [Berzins] How many have been turned over this year? 
  [Pavilonis] Twenty-one units with 86 facilities. 
  [Berzins] Twenty-one units in four months. For the remaining 
four months -- 191. How can this be accomplished without a "mad 
dash"? 
  [Pavilonis] There will be a "mad dash", there will... 
  [Berzins] They will make a "mad dash", but they are most 
likely prepared for it. But are we, likewise, prepared to handle 
such a mountain of returned property? The facilities should at 
least be protected. And it will also be necessary to make 
determinations... 
  [Pavilonis] Up until now, if there was an owner, the take 
over and protection did not create any major problems. 
  [Berzins] But there can be no owner until the Cabinet of 
Ministers confirms one. But that grindstone is turning very 
slowly. 
  [Pavilonis] The Cabinet of Ministers is issuing resolutions 
out of turn for certain facilities that may be needed more 
quickly. But even so, the number of resolutions has not managed 
to keep up with the number of committal acts. 
  [Berzins] So, we already couldn't keep up when there were 
relatively few facilities turned over. What will happen when the 
"mad dash" starts and there are many facilities to take over and 
decide on? How can these be protected to avoid their destruction 
and demolition? 
  [Pavilonis] It is possible that illegal activities will 
occur. If some official wants to "screw" someone, he could say: 
-- You are managing this property illegally, and I am suing you 
and throwing you out. 
  [Upmalis] The only positive thing is that for those 
facilities where the army unit is still present, likely owners 
have already appeared. As for what remains -- I don't think 
there will be a problem with taking over facilities located in 
Riga. The major facilities -- training grounds, airfields -- 
have already been taken over. There is still the matter of Adazi 
and Dobele, where the 25th brigade is situated. There is still 
the matter of "Strautini" in the Aluksne rayon, where a few 
complications will most certainly arise. There is also the 32 
meter high radio-telescopic antenna in the Ventspils rayon, 
which has not been awarded to anyone, yet. In turning over this 
facility, we are looking for possibilities of better utilization 
and preservation, because it is so specialized and so far into 
the forest that it will be impossible for the municipality to 
preserve it. Discussions about this facility are being held with 
the Russian Scientific Academy about cooperation among 
scientists from Latvia, Russia and other nations, all united 
under of the "Kvazar" program. Although the problems are 
monstrous -- this facility takes up 209 hectares of the forest, 
Latvian scientists do not have the strength to manage it, and 
the Russian side does not have the strength to organize and 
finance it, because, in order to prepare this facility for 
scientific purposes, the equipment must be changed. There are 
also high ranking officials in Latvia who would like to see this 
unique antenna turned into ashes and dust, because this is what 
some foreign services have supposedly recommended. 
  However, delays can be foreseen in the preparation of the 
administrative resolution bills. It will be a major job, and, in 
my opinion, after just one year, it is doubtful whether we will 
have all of the administrative resolutions in order for a 
property to be legally registered, etc. 
  Insatiable ministries are swallowing up plans and 
priorities. 
  [Berzins] Four years have already elapsed since Latvia 
declared independence. Soon, it will be three years since Latvia 
was recognized as independent. After half of a century, the 
foreign army is finally leaving, but only now, at the last 
minute, we are starting to worry about what to do with the 
Latvian land and the buildings constructed on this land for 
military purposes. We are looking for owners. Haven't we 
composed any sort of comprehensive program? 
  [Pavilonis] There are no comprehensive programs. When the 
commission on the takeover of military facilities has examined 
the case agreed upon, the question may be raised: what do you 
intend to do in this facility? And this does not happen every 
time. 
  [Berzins] This question doesn't have to be raised? If no one 
else wants it, then just take it away? 
  [Pavilonis] Yes. But, if there is more than one contender, 
then each is asked what he intends to do there. 
  [Berzins] Is it possible that there are some good facilities 
that no one wants? 
  [Pavilonis] There are some. Then basically the Supreme 
Council's resolution is in effect that the municipality must 
provide protection. 
  [Berzins] Even if that means from now until eternity? 
  [Pavilonis] Let the municipality decide how to manage it. 
  [Berzins] But then it would manage everything which happened 
to be in its territory, as, for example, the cooperative and 
state cooperative farms, which appear to be unnecessary at 
present. 
  [Pavilonis] If no one wants to take over a facility, then 
the 
Russians could be requested to take down the facility and plant 
grass. A green meadow would be left behind. 
  [Berzins] Of course you can ask, but will they do it? And 
even if they would take it down, who will have the nerve to ask 
them, when everyone is celebrating that "Thank God! They're 
finally gone!" Let's keep them here, so they can dawdle with the 
demolition?... 
  [Pavilonis] In some cases, it was headed in that direction. 
The Ventspils military unit vacated the territory, but the 
Ventspils municipal government did not want to receive this 
territory, if it was not included as a property owner. However, 
this land belongs to the state. 
  [Berzins] It seems as though we have not had enough time to 
resolve these and other sticky questions. But then, while all 
details may not be worked out, we could at least form a general 
conceptual program... 
  [Upmalis] Such a program has been very difficult, if not 
impossible, to set up because the ministries and municipalities 
have been so greedy. In the beginning, when these facilities 
were still very far from being turned over, all of the 
ministries presented their proposals and requested so many 
facilities that, when they reached the stage of actual takeover 
and examined them with their own eyes, they understood: the 
territory is enormously large, and they would have to pay taxes 
on it, and so, at the very last moment, they started to refuse 
these facilities. 
  And all of our plans -- we had beautiful plans! -- were gone 
with the wind. For example, the Ministry of Defense was given 
absolute priority, and some others were also given priority. But 
now, the Ministry of Defense has refused, on more than one 
occasion, to accept facilities, which have been turned over 
already, and now, we don't know what to do with these 
facilities. Like the Daugavpils fortress, for example, and that 
is not the only one. In the Naujene rural district, close to 
Daugavpils, there is also a miliary facility that was requested 
by the Ministry of Defense, but then refused. After that, the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs refused it. In the end, after this 
facility was already ransacked, when there was no longer 
anything there, it was graciously offered to the municipality. 
But Mr. Geiba said: "Nothing can be done there anymore, so we 
are also refusing to take it". 
  The point is reached that a facility literally goes to ruin 
because of irresponsibility. That is what happened with Vainode 
airport, as well. If they had not granted the request by the 
Ministry of Transportation to be assigned this facility, without 
asking the Ministry of Transportation what it wanted to do with 
the Vainode airport, then, in my opinion, it may have been 
possible to save this facility. Now it has been totally 
ransacked, and a large number of residential buildings stand 
empty and destroyed. It all looks very sad. That is what happens 
when a ministry agrees to accept something, but when it is 
necessary to start managing the property, it is unable to do so. 
  [Pavilonis] The saddest aspect is that the residential 
buildings remain uninhabited. We see and hear in Riga that many 
have no place to live. But, there, they have large five story 
buildings remaining empty and going to ruin. 
  [Berzins] The misfortune lies in that the Russians could not 
take them along, and we cannot take them to Riga. Nor to some 
city closer. 
  [Pavilonis] And why not. Vietumis does that: the 
construction 
company can take apart a large five story panel building, bring 
it closer to the city and "set" it up. I am not sure what this 
accomplishes, but at least the materials don't have to be 
assembled from scratch. 
  In Paplaka, already quite some time ago, the municipality 
inherited large residential buildings that were unwanted by 
everyone. They said: -- We don't have anyone to put in them, 
because, for the majority, we have our own private homes. 
  Private firms, fighting for a place in the sun, have a 
propensity for buying former military facilities from the 
Russian army. 
  [Berzins] But you are saying that all types of illegal 
actions are occurring, court hearings, one company, wanting to 
get in, chases out another one, which happens to be there 
already... 
  [Upmalis] Some of the returned facilities have been bought 
up 
by firms, which none of the Latvian institutions have been 
unable to determine what type of company they are. 
  For example, what is Lat-West-East, which has purchased a 
petroleum base still containing an army unit from Russia, and 
the sales contract states that this army unit can remain in 
Latvia and on the firm's territory, until such time that Russia 
decides to remove its army from there. In such a case, who 
decides whether the Russian army can be present here in Latvia? 
The administration of Latvia, Russia, or the firm? And, 
unfortunately, we are unable to do anything concrete. The only 
thing was when members of this military unit, which is located 
in the Viesturs Prospect petroleum base, and is owned by 
Lat-West-East, came to me and asked if I would please issue them 
driving permits for their automobiles, so that they could 
perform their routine activities, and I replied: -- You sold 
your territory, and you no longer have any here. 
  There are very many similar occurrences. 
  Furthermore. It is still possible for firms to purchase a 
facility from the army, and backdate the sale. This is because 
it is still not down in writing that firms must register and 
notarize the contracts for the sale of these facilities. 
  If you are a military unit commander and you have a seal, 
and 
I am a firm representative and I have a seal, and we perform the 
sales transaction using sales checks, then we would have no 
problem concluding a document dated, for example, August 1, 1991. 
  If everything has been performed to the letter of the law, 
plus, if the firm at that time was registered in the Latvian 
Registry of Businesses, then, in my opinion, no Latvian legal 
institution will be able to prove that this was an illegal 
action. 
  There is another painful matter that I would like to focus 
attention on: various firms that manufacture firearms have 
turned up in Latvia. 
  I am still uncertain about the licensing of such firms. One 
has moved in to an army manufacturing plant, which remains 
un-returned. It has made the purchase from Russia, and in quite 
an unusual manner. As we know, all manufacturing plants in 
Russia are part of the State Property Fund (SPF). That is not a 
military structure. Thus, the firm has made its purchase not 
from the army, but from Russia's SPF. Thus, it would seem that 
SPF has property in Latvia, since it is able to make the sale. 
  With respect to the firm La Con, in the Daugavgriva fortress 
territory, which, according to our views, is not operating in 
conformity with the laws of Latvia, we have submitted materials 
to the prosecutor's office for review. Our bureau does not have 
the right to review -- legally or illegally. We have not yet 
received the findings from the prosecutor, although we have in 
our possession agreements concluded between the firm and the 
Latvian naval forces on the use of the facility for 15 years. 
The facility is assigned to the Ministry of Defense, but the 
naval forces have already managed to conclude an agreement with 
the firm, without organizing any competitions, which they should 
have done. Many firms have signed up for this Daugavgriva port 
territory. 
  [Berzins] What is the major attraction there? 
  [Upmalis] Undoubtedly, the port. Agreements have been 
concluded with the blessings of the commander of the naval 
forces without, as far as I can tell, coordination with the 
Ministry of Defense. We can "thank" Mr.Zeibots, Mr. Zingis and 
the rest of the leading workers for this. This is no surprise, 
because the firm has a high ranking "benefactor", who is in the 
practice of lobbying. He is Mr. Kaza, who is attempting to 
support this firm with all sorts of means. I have a list of its 
founders. It was founded by the tradition principle: at the 
forefront is a person of Latvian nationality, who is a citizen, 
and all the rest -- people of Russian nationality. That is the 
traditional manner for companies. They say that the list of 
founders was later amplified with the name of Mr. Kaza. 
  I am most concerned in these cases, because they are not 
holding competitions on the basis of the business plan, as 
defined by the law. 
  This company, unfortunately, has taken down many major 
buildings which are still in unassigned territory. 
  I could mention many, many facilities for which the 
concluded 
actions will have to be reviewed by the prosecutor's office in 
time. This is because the documents concerning these actions, 
which we have available to us on the respective facility 
takeover, and those -- most interestingly! -- which the firms 
have not submitted, are, in our opinion, not too clean. 
  At one time, we had the plenary powers of the entire Council 
of Ministers, now we have only one -- the plenary power of the 
Ministry of Defense, and that is too little for us to be able to 
control the conclusion of all these actions. We also do not have 
to right to use sanctions against firms that pursue illegal 
actions. 
  Often with the help of a high ranking person, they go around 
the bureau, and have various ministries do the resolving, in 
accordance with their own views. 
  The bureau is not involved with the takeover of facilities. 
The bureau is concerned with the control of facility takeovers 
-- how they are turned over. 
  The commission led by Mr. Kosisis, -- the commission on the 
takeover of military facilities from the military forces of the 
Russian Federation, can also only make recommendations, and on 
the basis of such, the Cabinet of Ministers adopts resolutions 
on the utilization of such a facility. 
  Only they understand 
  [Berzins] Can we assume that the bureau has a complete 
picture of the Russian military units and military facilities 
still remaining in Latvia? 
  [Pavilonis] Yes. All have been accounted for and entered in 
the records. Nevertheless, there are times when some military 
unit shows up which is not in our records. Either it had been 
very well hidden, or was newly formed. That happened when the 
15th Air Army Headquarters at 55 Brivibas Street was eliminated. 
The military personnel remaining in Latvia relocated to Skulte 
airfield, where a new military unit was formed. Such a trick had 
not been anticipated in our documents. 
  [Berzins] Do they come to you for driving permits? 
  [Pavilonis] Not only that. If, for example, officers need to 
cross the border, drive somewhere on official business, they 
come to us for a permit. Permits to relocate automobiles. To 
bring out property. In this manner, we learn that a new unit has 
formed. This has been a rare occurrence recently. Thus, we have 
to assume that all of the military units present in Latvia have 
been accounted for. 
  [Berzins] When did it become clear that everything was 
included? 
  [Pavilonis] Two years ago, when the bureau started its work, 
two thirds of the military forces were known. The remaining 
third was accounted for in six months time. 
  When we started working, all units present in Latvia were 
considered to be secret. The Russian army would not give any 
lists. When we could say: here you have such a military unit, 
there -- that type, when we brought all ends together, only then 
did the veil of secrecy fall away. Recently they released a 
formerly highly secret document -- a summary of how many 
military units have been in Latvia since 1940. And not only 
military units, but also equivalent units -- institutions with 
various names which did not have a military unit number, but 
were simply issued a number. However, they have not admitted 
that the secret units with box office box numbers are theirs. 
  [Berzins] Then who do they belong to? 
  [Pavilonis] We are now trying to find out who started 
issuing 
post office box numbers for secret workshops and secret 
factories. Our bureau does not have extensive materials on the 
post office box factories. 
  [Berzins] But don't the factories exist? And what about 
their 
products? 
  [Pavilonis] The factories exist, but the products, which 
required the "post office boxes", have not been manufactured for 
a long time. There were secret workshops in VEF, Komutators, the 
Liepaja agriculture machinery factory, and many other places. As 
soon as ownership of the All-Union factories was tuned over to 
the Republic of Latvia, the manufacture of military products was 
discontinued. 
  [Berzins] Minor battles are being waged over the special 
military factories. 
  [Pavilonis] We have to find a compromise. If both sides 
refuse to budge from their positions, then the factory will be 
ransacked. The Russian army is secretly bringing out the major 
machinery. If they cannot manage to get it across the border, 
they sell it to some commercial concern, and the factory is left 
unable to function. 
  [Berzins] But maybe there is nothing wrong with bringing the 
machinery out. Let them do it in full force -- there won't be 
anything for the followers of Interfront to rally behind. The 
Latvian army, most likely, will never have that many tanks to 
keep a factory busy doing repairs at full capacity for a whole 
growing season. 
  [Pavilonis] The factories that were not needed by Latvia 
were 
all low level and have already been eliminated. But there are 
also those, which can be utilized expediently, and which have 
relatively modern equipment. It is economically more practical 
to save them, instead of eliminating them. 
  [Berzins] But we already have factories standing, which 
cannot produce anything substantial. What good will it do to 
have additional factories? 
  [Pavilonis] While the products of Latvia's industries have 
remained in warehouses until now, none of the military factories 
have full warehouses. Everything was sold. Their products were 
not only for the needs of the military units, but also goods for 
their personal consumption. And, likewise, these did not remain 
in warehouses. They were either of better quality, or the 
management was more exacting in production, and issued only as 
many products as needed. 
  Worthy, worthless. 
  [Berzins] And nothing worthless will remain behind after the 
Russian army leaves? 
  [Upmalis] There are at least three bunkers, which we don't 
know how to utilize. One in Adazi, in Muceniekos -- two. The 
15th Military Air Army Force Command Point in Muceniekos and the 
North Western Military Group Commander's Command Point in Adazi. 
They are two to three story underground buildings, containing 
equipment which consumes a great amount of energy to maintain 
suitability for occupancy -- pumping out underground water, etc. 
There is very high electrical consumption. 
  [Berzins] Let Mr. Mayorov take them along. 
  [Upmalis] We could allow him to do that. The demolition 
involves major problems. Likewise, with the bunker in Muceniekos 
-- it contains enormous amounts of reinforced concrete, all 
covered by soil. Should we allow it fill up with water? That is 
dangerous -- it could cause accidents. Blow it up and then bury 
it? Or maybe keep it as a historical monument and turn it into a 
tourist attraction. 
  Mr. Pavilonis, however, is very economically minded -- these 
bunkers would be suitable for mushroom cultivation, because a 
constant temperature and humidity can be maintained in them. The 
problem is that there are many bunkers and only one vegetable 
farming company, Riga, which would not be able to manage 
everything. If only there were funds to install an appropriate 
boiler system -- the one built by the army is too large to use 
for such purposes. 
  [Berzins] Aren't there also doubts about utilizing the 
formerly Baltic Military District, now North Western Military 
Group's Pentagon (read -- headquarters -- V.B.) 
building for Latvian army purposes -- even though a huge 
quantity of all types of listening devices remain planted there? 
  [Upmalis] We will have a great deal of problems with it. But 
how can you compare listening devices with live KGB agents, who 
are employed by our leading firms?! 
  [Berzins] Our Saeima, with amazing sincerity and for a long 
time, has been occupied with the KGB sacks and the five deputies 
suspected of collaboration, while several hundred KGB staff 
members are living high off the hog. 
  [Upmalis] I personally know a person who admits that he 
worked for the KGB. Looking at the list of a certain firm's 
founders, he showed me names of people he had worked with. And 
this is a very famous firm's founders list. Thus, if these 
gentlemen have healthy, very powerful firms, then why talk about 
five Saeima deputies, who probably don't have the financial 
means to influence anything today. Such firms have much greater 
possibilities. Everyone knows that, but nothing is done about 
it. That is why we need a law on these KGB agents, which, I 
believe, we will have soon. 
  I like the position taken by Mr. Bojars from the very 
beginning: yes, I don't deny I was such, but now I work for the 
good of Latvia, and so, accept me for what I am. If everyone who 
worked there would come forward to confess, and regret his 
sins... Patriotism is not dependent on where a person 
worked, but, rather, on how he did his job, 
what he did in his place of work, and how 
he is acting at present. 
  [Berzins] The Pentagon on Elizabetes Street will probably 
leave at the very end of the withdrawal term. 
  [Pavilonis] The 15th Air Army Headquarters left, even though 
some of its military units were still here. We assume that the 
North Western Military Group Headquarters will do the same. In 
private conversations, they are saying that they won't be the 
last to leave their premises.

<F P=106> [Conversation between Yelena Svetova and Vladimir </F>
Sergeyevich Kovalenko, academician, New York Academy of 
Sciences, professor, Kiev Polytechnic Institute (KPI), director, 
Institute of Laser Equipment and Technology, interspersed with 
commentary: ``Just Born and Already Universely Known. So They 
Say of the New Laser Equipment and Technology Institute Recently 
Appearing on the Scientific Map of the Ukraine''; the first four 
paragraphs are an introduction] 
  [Text] In actuality, scientists already long ago called 
this department of the university in the capital an 
``institute.'' Indeed, it was difficult for them to visualize 
that the personnel of the laser technologies laboratory of the 
KPI were by themselves capable of reaching the world level of 
development work and that the results of its activity would draw 
the closest attention in many countries. 
  And indeed, the former laboratory director, now the director 
of the new institute, professor Vladimir Kovalenko, is 
acknowledged to be one of the world's leading specialists in the 
modern technologies field. Accordingly, he was one of the first 
in the former USSR to be elected an academician of the New York 
Academy of Sciences and has become a member of the most 
prestigious international organizations of laser specialists, 
the coauthor and coeditor of many ultramodern scientific 
publications and catalogues. 
  The new scientific research institute is a structural 
subdivision of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute, intended to bring 
together the efforts of scientists at the university and many 
research institutes for solving problems in the scientific 
branch. This will assist considerably in regeneration of the 
Ukrainian economy. 
  At the KPI research in the field of laser equipment and 
technology has already been in progress for more than 30 years. 
The university laboratory, headed by Professor Kovalenko, has 
been transformed into a singular interbranch instructional, 
methodological and scientific center. His students have proposed 
to practical workers more than a few new methods for large-scale 
working of objects from metal, their hardening and local 
alloying, using laser radiation. Control points have been 
established at many enterprises where KPI representatives are 
helping to introduce modern technological processes. 
  ``Many feel that the establishment of new scientific 
institutes at the height of a very serious crisis is Utopian. 
After all, you are in no position to receive the most necessary 
material resources. How do you dare take the risk?'' I say in 
addressing the director. 
  ``On the other hand, we have a primary resource -- 
intellectual,'' responds Vladimir Sergeyevich Kovalenko. ``Only 
several years ago the former USSR accounted for more than 
32% 
of the world's engineers and scientists, with the Ukraine 
accounting for about 7%. This is an enormous potential on 
which 
our young country rests its hopes. With respect to the 
technologies which we have developed, it is precisely they which 
it is desirable be used extensively in our complex times. They 
are easily applied in small shops and laboratories and in 
commercial service facilities where they can be used 
successfully in cutting, joining and marking metals and other 
materials and filling a great many other orders. And saturate 
the market with products produced without gigantic production 
sites and unwieldy equipment. 
  Why are many academic institutes on the rocks? They are in 
the stage of introduction of innovations into industry for 
organizing new experimental lines of production (when 
considerable sums have still not been earned) and have no 
relatively inexpensive work force. We, adhering to the 
experience of the leading, well-developed countries, intend to 
rely on young people, students, who have energy, enthusiasm, 
assertiveness and ambition. They have their entire lives before 
them and therefore they do not fear to take a risk. 
  And still another circumstance. I became aware of it during 
my foreign trips, especially the last, when over the course of 
several months I lectured at one of the largest universities in 
the United States, located at the center of the state of Ohio.'' 
  ``I see here: in the documents which the Americans gave you 
were called a `Distinguished Visiting Professor'...'' 
  ``It appears that they have such an official title. But let 
me finish my thought. Abroad they regard our work with extreme 
respect, they intend to cooperate with us, carry out joint 
research experiments and exchange students. And representatives 
of the Ukrainian diaspora are even interested in having their 
children receive a higher education in the Ukraine. This will 
mean additional income for the KPI.'' 
  The cessation of the activity of the Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance (SEV) and the disappearance from the map of 
such a country as the GDR for only a short time stopped the 
scientific and creative contacts between the two largest 
universities in Europe -- Kiev Polytechnic Institute and the 
``Friedrich Schiller'' University at Jena. Now it is not 
ideological compatibility, but the significance of the research 
conducted at the KPI which has again attracted the attention of 
German scientists and has forced renewal of the joint work on 
developing new laser technologies and diagnostic systems which 
was interrupted for a year (this work was carried out earlier 
within the framework of the Complex Program of the Member 
Countries of the SEV, intended to run to the year 2000). 
  ``As a result of cessation of SEV activity, the funding of 
our joint work also ceased,'' continues Professor Kovalenko. 
  ``For some time we knew nothing about the future fate of our 
joint research. But then a letter was received from Germany in 
which they proposed a new program to run until 1995. It is 
ensured funding by the Association of Rectors of German 
Universities and makes provision for activation of the exchange 
of specialists and intensification of scientific research in the 
field of laser technologies and equipment.'' 
  For a long time Professor Kovalenko presented lectures to 
students and specialists in China, Japan and many other 
countries, also including countries of the former socialist 
camp, with which mutually advantageous agreements also have been 
concluded. 
  The distant island of Taiwan, with which the Ukraine has no 
diplomatic relations and where we have no trade or cultural 
representatives, opened its formerly tightly sealed doors to the 
scientists of the Ukraine. The first among them to be invited 
was Vladimir Kovalenko. Over the course of three weeks he 
presented lectures and consulted with Taiwanese colleagues on 
new technologies. The principal organizer and sponsor of the 
visit of Vladimir Sergeyevich to the island was the general 
director of one of the largest international companies in the 
world engaged in the fabrication and application of computer 
systems, which is located there. It specializes in deliveries of 
very complex equipment to the countries of East Europe. 
  ``Recent events have made possible a new look at the problem 
of using the latest advances in science and technology in 
different economic branches,'' says the scientist in ending our 
conservation. ``We can and must develop fundamentally new 
aspects of increase in the quality of production, find 
many-sided approaches to the introduction of highly efficient 
technologies under conditions of a developing market. The former 
mechanisms of innovative processes are hopelessly outdated. 
  Despite the crisis we have succeeded in acquiring a solid 
material base: laser apparatus, computers and other equipment. 
The Laser Technology Center, which includes the new institute 
and the department at the KPI, will provide strong encouragement 
for the development of a high-priority field and will enable 
Ukrainian scientists rightfully to enter the world laser 
community.''

<F P=106> [Unsigned article: ``Arguments and Figures''] </F>
  [Text] In the last number we reported that the Science 
Subcommittee on Education, Culture and Science of the State Duma 
tabled the draft budget proposed by the government with respect 
to the part relating to appropriations for science. It was 
proposed that it be returned to the government for a radical 
reworking. What induced the subcommittee (one of whose concerns, 
incidentally, is the revision of the budget for the purpose of 
reduction of government expenditures) to take such a decisive 
step? We bring to your attention the arguments of the 
subcommittee experts set forth in their conclusions concerning 
the draft law of the Russian Federation entitled ``On the 
Federal Budget for 1994'' in the section ``Fundamental Research 
and Facilitation of Scientific and Technical Progress.'' 
  ``The amount of funding of fundamental and applied science 
provided for in the draft budget is catastrophically inadequate. 
In comparison with 1991, when the fraction allocated for science 
was 1.03% of the GNP, the expenditures on scientific 
research 
in comparable prices have been reduced by half. 
  The calculations serving as a basis for the presented budget 
depart from the practices which took shape during the preceding 
years, solidify and intensify the pernicious tendencies, make no 
provision for structural changes and principles of budgetary 
policy have not been laid which would facilitate the necessary 
restructuring of the organization of scientific research. 
  The proposed draft budget retains the deformed structure of 
expenditures on science which has taken shape during recent 
years when the fraction of sums for the payment of labor and 
social security has added up to more than 81/%. The indicated 
structure completely ignores the sharp, by a factor of 30-50, 
increase in prices for fuel and electric power, the significant 
rise in prices for transportation and communal services, 
expenditures on scientific equipment, materials, reagents and 
scientific information. Thereby this ensures only the 
maintenance, and extremely inadequate at that, of part of the 
scientific personnel, without the possibility of conducting 
scientific research itself. 
  "The sum of proposed expenditures for science in the amount 
of 11.8 trillion rubles, figuring in the composite balance, 
should not lead one astray because 2/3 of this sum is an 
unbudgeted fund for scientific research, development, testing 
and engineering work, allocations to which are not of a 
mandatory character and therefore under economic crisis 
conditions are unrealistic (in 1993 of the predicted 1.7 
trillion rubles of unbudgeted sums for scientific research, 
development, testing and engineering work in actuality only 41.6 
billion were actually received). Thus, in actuality, one should 
count only on the budgeted component -- 4.5 billion rubles 
(0.6% of the GNP). 
  The presented draft budget strengthens the residual 
principle 
of funding of the scientific sphere because it is funded from 
the development budget, whose formation, in accordance with the 
law ``On the Budget System of the Russian Federation,'' can be 
carried out only in the absence of a budget deficit, but such a 
deficit is embodied in the presented draft. Thus, science has 
virtually no guarantees of funding. 
  In the opinion of the subcommittee, the expenditures for 
civilian science included directly in the federal budget for 
1994 in Article 15, Section 4, should not be 4.5 trillion 
rubles, but not less than 7.7 trillion rubles (1% of the 
GNP 
and 4.2% of all the budgeted expenditures, which is half 
less 
the fraction of the GNP allocated for science in the 
well-developed countries and is acceptable only if there are 
substantial tax, tariff and customs privileges), of which not 
less than 2.8 trillion rubles must be directed to material 
expenditures, purchase of scientific publications, ensuring a 
modern level of informational servicing of scientists, as well 
as compensation for the expenditures on energy for the 
maintenance of scientific institutions and covering the 
expenditures on energy by scientific projects having high energy 
requirements. Thus, the minimum expenditures on science require 
the additional allocation of 3.2 trillion rubles. 
  Even these sums will make it possible to cover the needs of 
only a part of the scientific research and therefore at the same 
time it is necessary to make provision for an increase in the 
direct funding of projects and programs, specifically directed 
support of scientific schools and groups, as well as individual 
researchers. The fraction of the budgeted sums (including the 
monies subject to distribution through funds, ensuring the 
implementation of a selective scientific and technical policy, 
must be not less than 45% of the total expenditures on 
science. 
  In this case it will become possible to direct to the 
funding 
of fundamental science, which is a national cultural treasure 
and which which will provide the premises for economic rebirth 
of the country, about 2.5 trillion rubles (0.35% of the 
GNP, 
which corresponds to the structure of expenditures for these 
purposes in the well-developed countries). It must be emphasized 
that the funding of fundamental science throughout the world is 
virtually completely assumed by the state.'' 
  The conclusion that there is a need for allocating 
additional 
sums was supported by the participants at a conference of the 
subcommittee which was attended by representatives of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, Russian Academy of Agricultural 
Sciences, Russian Academy of Education, Russian Academy of the 
Arts, Russian Academy of Architecture and Construction Sciences, 
Russian Engineering Academy, Academy of Technological Sciences, 
Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow State University, Council of 
Rectors of Moscow Colleges and Universities, State Archives, 
State Committee for Higher and Intermediate Education and 
Russian Ministry of Science and Technical Policy.

<F P=106> [Interview of V. Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of </F>
Agricultural Sciences, by Viktor Trushkov, PRAVDA correspondent, 
``Science Suffers From Starvation''; the first paragraph is an 
introduction, the last paragraph is a postscript] 
  [Text] V. Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences, deputy chairman of the Committee on 
Education, Culture and Science of the Russian Federation Duma, 
answers questions from a PRAVDA correspondent, Viktor Trushkov. 
  Trushkov: Viktor Stepanovich, permit me to 
congratulate you: insofar as I recall, for the first time in the 
history of Russian legislative authority the parliament has 
included in its agenda a special law on science. 
  Shevelukha: Not simply on science, but also on the 
critical situation in science. It is true that such an approach 
did not sit well with some deputies. 
  Until now there have been no programs for the reorganization 
of scientific research in our country. Accordingly, the 
Committee on Education, Culture and Science of the State Duma 
decided to draw the attention of the Duma, government leaders, 
ministries and departments to this vitally important problem. 
  In world and former national practice 60-67% of all 
the 
appropriations for science were spent on fundamental research, 
25-30% went to applied research and 8-10% went to 
technical 
and other development work. Such an infrastructure of 
expenditures on science has been the case for many years in the 
United States and other well-developed countries. So it also was 
both in the USSR and in Russia up to 1990 inclusive. Now 
everything is different. First slowly, and then at an 
accelerated rate, the government of Russia began to reduce the 
amounts of budgeted funding for science and by late 1993 had 
reduced it to 0.7% of the GNP. The financial bind in 
science 
first of all affected salaries of scientists. In late 1993 they 
received from 30 to 70 thousand rubles per month, which is two 
or three times less than the average wage of all categories of 
workers in the country. The payment of even this miserly wage is 
constantly in arrears at many institutes and institutions of 
higher and intermediate education. 
  Trushkov: Is it not fundamental science which has 
suffered most severely? There is no real market for its product. 
  Shevelukha: To be sure. Here development work 
cannot be turned immediately into a product which would make it 
possible to obtain additional sums for the funding of science. 
As a result, there has been a rapid curtailment of research in 
the fields of mathematics, physics, electronics, information 
science, theoretical biology and the most important branches of 
the humanities. Highly qualified scientists are leaving the 
laboratories and institutes for other spheres of activity and 
are going abroad. 
  Becoming convinced of the growing catastrophe, the Ministry 
of Science and Technical Policy has attempted to bring about 
additional injections of funds. A fund for fundamental research 
was established. But its resources are negligible: 3% of 
all 
expenditures on science. It was clear that this was not enough. 
Then the government decided to ``rescue'' science in another 
way: designate science centers for the most important priorities 
in fundamental and applied sciences, based on already existing 
institutes. But this also will scarcely do the job. 
  First of all, where is the guarantee that a proper choice 
will be made of the future priorities in the field of 
fundamental research? The entire history of world science gives 
evidence that such priorities arise in the course of the 
internal logic of development of science itself, not on the 
basis of the prevision of government officials. And second, the 
organization of so-called science centers in accordance with the 
``latest'' concepts of the Ministry of Science and Technical 
Policy will inevitably result in the elimination of the solid 
front of fundamental research making up the optimum 
infrastructure of science, and also to the shifting of the 
greater part of expenditures from the sphere of the fundamental 
sciences into the field of technological development work. 
  Trushkov: Recently foreign sponsors have appeared 
in Russian science. Their assistance is widely heralded. And 
what is the effect? 
  Shevelukha: In actual practice this assistance for 
the time being for the most part has a propagandistic character 
and is being made available in inadequate, symbolic amounts. But 
it is accompanied, as a rule, by the collection of highly 
important information on the principal research directions, on 
scientific priorities, on the structure and attainments of 
Russian science. 
  Judge for yourself: Russian scientists each receive $500 in 
one small grant (donative sum for a high-priority purposeful 
project) from the International Soros Fund. Three years in a row 
the World Bank has promised to render assistance to Russian 
agrarian science. Many private proposals arrive from abroad for 
our scientists asking that they carry out special-order priority 
tasks in Russian or foreign laboratories, with their results 
being sent abroad. But, indeed, it is well known that almost all 
those who are rendering assistance to Russian science are 
pursuing the objective of adapting and using the powerful 
scientific and technical potential of Russia in the interests of 
their own countries. 
``echelon of science'' -- in technological research? 
  Shevelukha: There also the conditions are pitiful. 
I will cite an example from a sphere close to me. Due to the 
reduction in state support there is a sharp decline in research 
not only in theoretical biology, but also in bioengineering. 
Laboratories are closing and specialists are departing for 
abroad. 
  But it is precisely by modern bioengineering methods that in 
the next few years throughout the entire world there will be a 
qualitative improvement in plants, animals and microorganisms 
used in medicine, agriculture and in the processing and food 
industry. 
  Unfortunately, none of this is being taken into account by 
the leaders of the country. Meanwhile, in the United States, in 
the European countries, in Japan, and during recent years also 
in China, India, Vietnam and in many countries of Africa and 
Latin America national bioengineering programs are being 
developed and applied. But we made the first breakthrough. 
  Trushkov: The picture which you have drawn is a 
joyless one. The experience of Soviet science, if it is not 
being slighted, is being cast aside. But there is still world 
experience. Two different approaches to the choice of a state 
scientific and technical policy are known. First, the 
``American'' variant, in which there is assurance of a broad 
front of fundamental research carried out by budgeted and other 
financial sources in the United States. The research results are 
used both for national needs and for the world market. Second, 
the ``Japanese'' variant, in which most of the new technologies 
are based on the purchase of patents from abroad and on their 
basis the latest national industry is organized. The high 
competitiveness in production makes up for the cost of acquiring 
patents and makes it possible to create their own scientific 
potential. Which of these routes is more acceptable for Russia? 
  Shevelukha: Neither one of them is suitable in its 
pure form. We need our own way in the development of science and 
industrial technologies. And, in particular, under the 
present-day conditions. It essentially involves our own research 
in priority fields. This is much cheaper than the purchase of 
patents. Only in this case is it possible to ensure a gradual 
reduction in the volumes of importation of the latest 
technologies and the creation of our own competitive production 
of products with a high scientific input for our country and for 
sale on the world market. Precisely for this reason it is 
entirely inadmissible that there be a sharp reduction in space 
programs because there is an ongoing precipitous narrowing of 
the possibilities for producing the latest technologies in 
almost all economic branches. 
  Trushkov: But not being concerned about the 
future, may political favorites not put the focus on applied 
research? 
  Shevelukha: The reduction of budgeted funding has 
undermined the basis for the successful development of many 
priority aspects of applied research. As an example, I will once 
again cite a sphere which is close to me. The importance of 
plant selection and animal breeding is obvious to all; it exerts 
an enormous influence on the solution of acute agrarian and 
economic problems in the country as a whole. Precisely in these 
fields of applied science in the not distant past Russian 
scientists attained outstanding results which received world 
recognition. The genofund of varieties and hybrids of plants, 
animals and birds which they formed served as a basis for major 
achievements in plant selection and animal breeding in many 
countries. If today the good results of selection still persist 
in Russia it is due only to the enthusiasm of scientists of the 
older and middle generations. Despite the wretched wages, the 
lack of attention to it on the part of the state, they continue 
to manifest scientific zeal. During 1993 345 new varieties and 
hybrids of agricultural plants were developed and 182 were 
regionalized. More than 4000 varieties and hybrids have been 
developed and regionalized in Russia. This represents enormous 
national wealth. But the enthusiasm of selection specialists 
will soon dry up and the agrarian sector of the economy will 
have to rely on the old store of varieties and breeds. However, 
even that paultry economic support to selection science which 
was provided for by the Law on Selection Attainments, adopted in 
1993 and signed by V. N. Yeltsin, unfortunately is not being 
delivered. The Finance Ministry and the Economics Ministry still 
refuse to carry out the economic measures for supporting 
selection work provided for in the law. Meanwhile the level of 
budgeted funding for selection work in the country is already 
less than 30% of the needs. 
  Trushkov: But is it possible that applied science 
will begin to flourish with a changeover to a market economy? 
Possibly the scientists in this sphere, whose ``democrats'' are 
accused of inability to master market mechanisms, are 
responsible. 
  Shevelukha: To be sure, under conditions of entry 
into the market scientists working in the applied science sphere 
must learn to advertise and market their scientific products. 
And this also applies to research of a technological nature in 
all scientific fields. 
  But try to visualize a situation in which a talented 
scientist is forced to use more than half his time allocated for 
scientific research in seeking a buyer and sale of his product. 
This is a squandering of the national wealth. A scientist should 
be engaged in research work. Now many branch scientific research 
institutes are seeking different self- funding methods. The 
institutes and experimental stations of the Russian Academy of 
Agricultural Sciences, for example, cover almost of the 
expenditures in their activity by the sale of seeds, breeding 
cattle and vaccines, by contracting for the introduction of 
scientific advances and by other kinds of commercial activity. 
But in this case scientists are burdened by work which is not 
really their own and there is a decrease in the efficiency of 
scientific research. 
  Conclusion No. 1 -- more than half the expenditures on 
applied research must be covered by the state budget. For 
covering the second half of the expenditures it would be 
possible to enlist commercial organizations engaged in the sale 
of scientific products. But government agencies should be 
concerned about such a dual source of organization and funding 
of science. 
  Trushkov: Is there hope that the State Duma will 
assist in the survival of Russian science? 
  Shevelukha: I think that it will. The adoption of 
reasonable laws favoring a rebirth rather than the suffocating 
of science is the primary intent of the parliament. 
  Postscript -- The State Duma has adopted a decree entitled 
``On the Critical Situation in Russian Science.'' In this decree 
it is proposed that the government examine the problem of 
ensuring the preservation and further development of the 
scientific potential of the country on the basis of priority 
funding of fundamental and promising practical research, 
establishing a commission for developing mechanisms for the 
funding of science, working out a program of state support for 
the entry of national scientific and development work into the 
world market, setting up a fund for the funding of expenditures 
on the patenting of scientific attainments abroad and 
formulating a program of measures for preserving the personnel 
base of science. 
  The Duma spoke out for the granting of tax privileges to 
scientific, planning, design and educational institutions. It 
considers it to be inadmissible that monies for the funding of 
higher education be transferred to subjects of the Russian 
Federation and requires that in 1994 institutions of higher and 
intermediate education be funded from the federal budget.

<H5>  Announcement on INTAS Research Grants for 1993 -- 509 </H5>
Projects of Scientific Cooperation With the Former Soviet Union 
Launched 
  -- At its General Assembly meeting on 21st December 1993, 
the 
INTAS Association (International Association for the Promotion 
of Cooperation with Scientists from the Independent States of 
the Former Soviet Union), set up at the initiative of the 
European Commission, has adopted 509 cooperation projects 
between laboratories in West Europe and in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). The total contribution made by the INTAS 
Association to these projects amounts to 21 million ECU. 
  -- ``With this portfolio of projects, declared Prof. 
Antonio, 
Commissioner in charge of research at the European Commission, 
the INTAS Association constitutes one of the major actors and 
key elements in scientific cooperation between Western Europe 
and the former Soviet Union republics''. 
  -- Each project associates a minimum of two laboratories in 
Western European countries and one in a FSU country. In total, 
1214 FSU laboratories and 1754 of the INTAS member States 
laboratories are involved in the action. 
  -- Covering a wide spectrum of disciplines in exact and 
natural sciences (physics, astrophysics, mathematics, chemistry, 
life sciences, Earth sciences, environment); applied sciences 
and technologies (engineering sciences, aeronautics, space, 
etc.) and social, economic and human sciences, these projects 
represent frontier research and are based on cooperation with 
mutual benefit. Involvement in these joint activities will 
permit research teams of the New Independent States to stay in 
their laboratories and get to continue their work at an 
international level. 
  -- The funds awarded by INTAS to the FSU laboratories are 
essentially to cover the renumeration of their scientists; the 
funds directed to the Western European laboratories will cover 
project coordination costs. 
  -- The 509 projects are the result of a call for submission 
of research proposals launched just after the setting up of 
INTAS and with the deadline of 15 October 1993. The large number 
of proposals received were evaluated by the Council of 
Scientists of the Association, which consists of eminent 
scientists from the European Union and the New Independent 
States. 
  -- These projects represent a second wave of projects 
launched by INTAS. A first wave of 54 projects were launched in 
June 1993 for a total amount of 4 million ECU. 
  -- New INTAS Association activities are foreseen for 1994 
and 
should be announced in the beginning of this year. 
  -- INTAS Association groups the European Union, its twelve 
Member States, Austria, Finland, Switzerland and all of the 
independent states of the former Soviet Union (Armenia, 
Azerbaidjan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldovia, 
Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan). It 
was officially set up on 29 June 1993 by the first meeting of 
its General Assembly.

<F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Tokarenko, DELOVOY MIR; ``It is Better to </F>
be Clever and Rich... What is the Future of the Novosibirsk 
Akademgorodok: Intellectual Base of Civilized Entrepreneurship 
or the `Brain Center' of Criminal Syndicates?...''] 
  [Text] ...Surely for the first time the poet Andrey 
Voznesenskiy, spoiled by ``sold out'' notices, was faced with a 
hard fact: the public might not be coming to hear him. Not in 
this present-day Akademgorodok, the once freedom-loving child of 
the ``thaw.'' Some have departed for the West by permanent 
contract"; the capital of our impoverished science has 
``cleansed itself'' of others, those seeking the sole 
possibility for keeping themselves afloat: sell their apartment 
and acquire a modest corner beyond the limits of this 
prestigious region which is more in keeping with their salary. 
The once elite law-abiding Akademgorodok is today the second in 
the rate of increase in crime among the nine rayons of 
Novosibirsk with its population of 1.5 million. 
  The prediction, fortunately, did not prove to be justified. 
There were no empty seats in the hall of the House of 
Scientists. But the poet, not closing his eyes the entire night 
prior to his impending appearance, evidently himself sensed 
something, on the eve of his appearance writing in the plane: 
  Precious is the time when I visited Akademgorodok. After the 
passage of time I fly again in returning to the East. 
  Suddenly you are no more? And to what will I arrive -- Into 
the academic darkness or into the academic light? 
  I am drawn to this little city, I do not understand why. Or 
am I a paradox -- free in captivity? 
  Alas, there are more than enough paradoxes to go around. In 
a 
society in many respects ready for changes, caught up by the 
dogmas of a numbed and hypocritical system (it has been 
nicknamed ``demgorodok''), the habitat of intellectuals, of 
those in their sixties, today has literally been taken over by 
the criminal world, controlling the ``market'' in accordance 
with their criminal concepts. 
  During the incomplete last year there was a 48.7% 
increase 
in criminal activity; for heinous crimes, by 73.2%, for 
gang 
crimes, by 49.4%. The number of newly registered persons 
here 
has almost twice exceeded the number of displaced former 
residents of Akademgorodok (in other rayons these shifts were 
approximately equal). 
  Who are they who have ``closed in'' on the still not 
departing academicians and corresponding members? Data from the 
information center of the Novosibirsk Oblast police department 
also give an answer to this question: persons arriving with a 
checkered background of criminal code violations. Those who 
earlier already have committed crimes have here increased in 
numbers by an amazing 1550%. 
  And with them the very mentality of Akademgorodok also is 
gradually changing. Its world status is being degraded to a flea 
market with all the same petty hawkers, conducting their trade 
in lop-sided competitions with displays of the programs of 
international symposia. The cafe ``Pod integral'' [``Under the 
Integral'], famed for its ``suspect'' friendly evenings at the 
time of the ``flourishing of stagnation,'' has disappeared. The 
restaurants, where once at the tables discussions were continued 
by the leading lights of science, coming here from throughout 
the world, now also have other owners, including racketeers and 
``easy girls.'' And this was demonstrated by the clientele, 
mercilessly assaulting a recently respected academician who had 
been so bold as to dine at the ``Yermak''... 
  How did it happen that the scientists who both Cambridge and 
Oxford Universities have awarded the titles ``Man of the Year'' 
and ``Man of the Century'' have been forced to look each new day 
in the eye, bearing ever-increasing lack of assurance in life 
under the realities of the market? How is it that those who feed 
world science ideas (according to data of Western experts, 
together with Moscow scientists Novosibirsk scientists hold 
first place with respect to the number of citations to their 
studies) at times are basically unable to support their families? 
  As is well known, Professor Bormental from the novel ``A 
Dog's Heart,'' by Bulgakov, tried to humanize Sharikov. But he 
himself became his victim. Not finding its place in the changing 
coordinates of time and social conditions, the capital of 
Siberian science has granted to each of its inhabitants the 
``freedom'' to solve the market problem ``in their individual 
way.'' To put it more simply, to seek ways to survive. And 
become a victim not only of the chaos, but also of the clearly 
defined dangerous tendencies. 
  Here is the prediction of T. Galkina, a specialist of the 
Novosibirsk Russkoye Zarubezhye Humanitarian Center. 
  ``It would be the height of naivete to assume that the 
`brains' not used by the state have escaped the attention of the 
criminal gangs. The `conveyor of ideas,' which could create 
original industrial technologies, will be in the service of the 
criminal world. The external factors responsible for the burst 
of criminal activity (struggle of Western companies for the 
Siberian market, foreign exchange transactions, geopolitical 
situation, etc.) and the internal crisis, driving enormous 
masses of people to the brink of poverty, proved to be closely 
intertwined in Siberia. Novosibirsk, having a powerful 
industrial, financial and scientific potential, is at the center 
of formation not only of the traditional criminal elements of 
the work force, capital and valuable papers, but also, and which 
is most dangerous, shadowy intellectual elements. The recruiting 
of personnel for the criminal world will be from academic 
institutes, branch scientific research institutes, colleges and 
universities, disbanded design bureaus of industrial enterprises 
and other subdivisions. 
  It is most probable that in the very near future the state 
and power structures will run up against a very clearly 
expressed intellectualization of criminality in Siberia: that is 
the conclusion of sociologists. This links up with the warning 
of workers in public health agencies: Novosibirsk is in danger 
of becoming the center of drug traffic in the Asian-Pacific 
Ocean region. It is assumed that the heroin `picked up' here is 
in actuality the product of an underground laboratory and the 
organization of technically complex chemical production did not 
come about without drawing upon strong brainpower.'' 
  ``Are both the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of 
Sciences and the business people of Siberia, for whom the 
portrayed prospects are identically dangerous, taking heed of 
these predictions? Alas, the vectors of their movements in 
general are pointed in different directions.'' 
  ``Only recently, at the annual meeting of the Siberian 
Department, Russian Academy of Sciences, there was a discussion 
of precisely this subject. Having ascertained that state money 
will suffice only for a modest salary and the payment for 
electricity, some speakers were distressed: if only two or three 
years ago the presidium had decided to offer national and 
foreign companies rooms for offices, land for construction... 
Today Akademgorodok would be a Siberian business center, 
attractive for investments, including for the development of the 
social infrastructure. Such an idea was advanced in his time by 
V. Parmon, corresponding member, Russian Academy of Sciences. If 
only things had been speeded up a little and the AO Sibirskaya 
Yarmarka [Siberian Fair] had been established, an exhibition 
center would have been opened for the display of new 
technologies and products with a high scientific content... And 
this possibility went out the window. However, the ``Fair'' has 
today become the third in Russia (after Moscow and St. 
Petersburg) international trade center... 
  Now only 3 of 15 have remained in our laboratory. The 
laboratory head urged them on and on: you, he says, are the true 
knights of science. Together, he says, we will `hold the fort,' 
not giving in to the market bait. But today I was shaken when I 
saw him, a doctor of sciences, a professor, sitting in the 
subway on sacks and selling sugar! Now I myself will probably 
think that over. Evidently there is no other way out.'' 
  This monologue of a specialist of an academic institute, 
receiving, incidentally, a grant from the Soros Fund, is 
extremely characteristic. But there are examples boding still 
more weighty ill consequences, both to the priorities of science 
and to the economy of the country. Reference is to an 
``intellectual racket,'' when specialists, breaking free from 
real science, establish their own work associations, then using 
for their own advantage the development work which is the 
intellectual property of entire scientific teams. These are the 
fruits of all this same indecisiveness, when the fear of losing 
``pride'' in the end results in its loss at the greatest cost... 
  Hoping to the last hour that the state would not allow 
science to wind up in a recumbent position, Academy structures 
did not seek out possibilities for befittingly adapting to the 
market. By no means under the slogan ``Everything is for sale!'' 
But from a position of partnership, cooperation which could 
prove advantageous both to science itself and to business. Now, 
judging from the funding, which is contracting, like shagreen 
leather, the academicians understood: the state does not need 
science. 
  Without question, Academician V. Koptyug, chairman of the 
Presidium, Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences, was 
correct in saying: ``Sometime society will understand that 
without science and education there can be no normal state.'' 
But it is indeed not precluded that this awareness will arrive 
only when the Akademgorodok remains in ruins... Possibly it may 
be realized a little sooner that it already today is capable of 
serving entrepreneurship? Indeed, this will help in saving both 
personnel and potential and traditions. 
  But here is what is the most important. Siberian science is 
not only real ``food'' for entrepreneurship, capable, with 
advantage for the country and people, of developing and 
introducing sometimes priority development work and projects. 
The potential of the Akademgorodok institutes could provide a 
conceptual ideology of a civilized market, a prediction of its 
development (including in the highly important sphere of use of 
environmental resources), and set benchmarks for legislative 
initiative. Optimum approaches to solution of various problems 
with allowance for the trade and other infrastructure of the 
region could be suggested. 
  And how much can be learned from the history of 
entrepreneurship in Siberia! Indeed, much of that which at times 
led businessmen of the first generation into a blind alley had 
already been ``invented'' by the owners of metallurgical plants 
and landowners, grain traders and merchant dynasties of the past 
centuries... 
  But the market structures for the time being do not exhibit 
any special push toward such an alliance. However, credit must 
be given: the ``Siberian Merchants Meeting,'' the ``Siberian 
Fair,'' and the Interregional Association of Entrepreneurs were 
not sparing in their organizational expenditures for the 
scientific conference ``Siberian Entrepreneurship: Past, 
Present, Future.'' The preparations for it were made by 
scientists of the History Institute, Siberian Department, 
Russian Academy of Sciences. But the leading business figures 
were not in the half-empty hall. The scientists ``enlightened 
themselves.'' This fact, alas, is not the only one. And they, 
unfortunately, add to the pessimism of the citizens of 
Akademgorodok as to the very possibility of bringing science and 
business closer together. 
  Others with bitterness cite the example of Irkutsk, where 
scientists recently, with the support of the RF Ministry of 
Science and Technical Policy, established Siberia's first Market 
and Entrepreneurship Institute. It would seem that this 
scientific subdivision was assigned benevolent tasks: search for 
and validation of acceptable procedures for the transitional 
period, study of problems in the regional goods market, 
collaboration in the development of regional trade balances and 
research on the prospects for social development of Siberia. And 
here's what's surprising: the local entrepreneurs not only were 
not interested in contacts with the specialists, but are 
actively trying to dislodge the institute from the building 
legally belonging to it... 
  The following was heard at the already mentioned annual 
meeting of the Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences: 
the only thing which can now save Akademgorodok is income from 
the development of new technologies by orders from national and 
foreign firms. Such orders from the oil- and gold-producing 
branches and the fuel-energy complex also may enable us to do 
this. With respect to ``foreign exchange'' contracts, some 
scientists fear that they may become a scientific appendage of 
the well-developed countries, may become cheap ``brains'' for 
them. 
  It was really necessary to be clever in order to choose at 
what price to become rich...

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Smirnov, IZVESTIYA correspondent: ``How Yu. </F>
A. Izrael Was Elected an Academician''; the first paragraph is 
an introduction] 
  [Text] At the last General Meeting of the Russian Academy 
of Sciences, by 230 votes ``yea,'' 88 votes ``nay,'' with 14 
ballot papers deemed to be invalid, Yuriy Antoniyevich Izrael 
was elected a Russian academician. The election did not go off 
smoothly. The stumbling block was the behavior of Yu. A. Izrael 
during the Chernobyl catastrophe. He then headed the USSR State 
Committee for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring 
(Goskomgidromet; Gidromet]. Here are several fragments of the 
stenographic record of the discussion (the shorthand record is 
incorrect, but the essence of the accusations and the 
counterarguments is conveyed rather precisely). 
I know not about the number of new writings by Izrael, nor about 
his expeditions; I can look that up for myself. I would like to 
know the number of victims, the number of unfortunate there were 
due to the Chernobyl catastrophe, and after that, how Izrael 
concealed the true character of the radiation and the first days 
when no one visualized what this involved. Approximately how 
many of these victims were there, surely, at least what was the 
order of magnitude, the scale of the criminality?" 
  Academician S. T. Belyayev: ``The basis for taking 
the necessary measures after the Chernobyl accident should have 
been the numerous data on radiation conditions from different 
departments. Those data from the Goskomgidromet warrant the 
highest evaluation. The reliability and trustworthiness of the 
information collected by it were later checked by various 
international organizations and intercalibrations were carried 
out. The yearlong work of the enormous body of specialists of 
the international project of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency, which did not find any serious flaws in the data 
presented by Gidromet, is known to everyone. 
  Now about the role of Yuriy Antoniyevich himself. He relied 
only on scientifically dependable information, not giving in to 
any pressure on the part of the administrative and political 
agencies, which initially was especially strong. 
  With respect to the information which was suppressed, that 
is, what was not published in the newspapers, that is not 
Izrael's fault. That he insistently required the dissemination 
of all information to the local agencies which were responsible 
for all measures carried out on the spot, I myself was a witness 
to that. You know that the Chernobyl problem was closely 
intertwined in all political problems and ambitions, a situation 
which also is continuing to this time. 
  Here it was necessary display firmness and persistence based 
on scientific information and not yield to pressure from any 
other groups which were whipped up into a frenzy. And from what 
were there more victims later on: from the mass stress to which 
an enormous number of people was subjected, or from the specific 
radiation situation which actually prevailed? 
  "I think that I can speak of this because I observed Yuriy 
Antoniyevich during the course of all these events. And after 
1986 I was first a deputy of Anatoliy Petrovich [Academician A. 
P. Aleksandrov -- editor's explanation], who headed the 
Interdepartmental Coordination Council of the Academy of 
Sciences, responsible for all the scientific problems related to 
Chernobyl. An enormous number of nonprofessional organizations 
were involved in all kinds of measurements. And in each case it 
was necessary to analyze the methodological errors. All this 
work also was organized by Gidromet; there was a scientific 
council which examined all the measurements, all the data which 
were collected by all organizations whatsoever. And such data 
were never released until the reasons for discrepancies were 
clarified. 
  That's all that I want to say: the merits of Yuriy 
Antoniyevich as an administrator, as a scientist at the time of 
the Chernobyl accident, were manifested very clearly, as was 
noted, among others, by many international organizations.'' 
  Academician V. L. Maslov: ``I asked a specific 
question: what were the numbers, what was the scale? With 
respect to whether Izrael was involved in the misinformation, I 
did not ask that question. I know the answer to it. I also was 
engaged in the liquidation of the Chernobyl accident. 
  But I think that everyone saw Izrael on television when he 
gave the people incorrect radiation information. That the 
Gidromet did a good job, I know very well; I also know that it 
gave correct information. I say only that the people were given 
(and everyone knows this) incorrect information. I saw a 
videofilm, I saw how the children ran and looked at the fire 
there, in Chernobyl. I saw a pregnant woman who pushed a small 
child in a wheelbarrow, rather than in a carriage. But what was 
of importance to me was: what was the scale?'' 
  Next several of our respected academicians spoke out in 
defense of Yu. A. Izrael. There was mention of the first press 
conference on Chernobyl on 5 May 1986 where Shcherbina, citing 
Izrael, gave low figures on radioactivity. These were precise 
data, but applying to regions in a 30- km radius from the 
accident site. However, Shcherbina was silent that the 
Goskomgidromet also gave precise nuclear power plant figures for 
Pripyat. 
  In the opinion of the academicians, Izrael could not then 
publicly refute the accusations that he concealed information 
because until May 1989 all precise data on Chernobyl were kept 
under the strictest secrecy. But at the first opportunity he 
published his charts, prepared in 1986-1987. The verification 
commission of the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed 
his data. One of the international scientific centers awarded 
Izrael a gold medal with the inscription: ``For Chernobyl.'' 
Then he was awarded prizes by the UN and the International 
Meteorological Organization. 
  Conclusion: the guilt of the designers, the guilt of the 
government, three years concealing the true data about 
Chernobyl, cannot be shifted to Yu. A. Izrael, who from the very 
first day gave precise data on the scale of the catastrophe. 
  From the hall: ``A question, please, for Yuriy 
Antoniyevich relative to the discussion which arose. I fully 
trust those data which were presented here. But I have a 
question: why then did Yuriy Antoniyevich, at that time knowing 
that falsified data were being given in contradiction to the 
information which he gave, not resign from his position?'' 
  Yu. A. Izrael: ``No one forced me to present any 
incorrect data or to falsify them. As proof I can say that 
Mikhail Sergeyevich (M. S. Gorbachev -- editor's explanation) 
and Gromyko at a Politburo session asked me questions like: what 
is a `curie,' what is a `roentgen per hour'? Do you think that 
people with such a scientific background can force any 
particular figures to be given? Such people cannot give such and 
such a figure, you understand? 
  All the solid information was given to the leadership -- 
higher and local. Unfortunately, really, the matter of 
publication widely in the newspapers could not be solved by me, 
but we supplied objective information. I flew directly through 
the Belarus and Ukrainian countryside and in those regions which 
had been subjected to the greatest pollution I personally 
explained to the people why they had to leave their native 
villages. Many of them did not want to depart, they even shot 
back, can you imagine that? 
  I did not receive and we did not receive even a single 
professional negative comment with respect to our data. 
  With respect to the question which was posed last, I must 
once again assert that my task was to pass on all the data, 
insofar as they were objective, to those people who had need for 
them. These were the people who suffered from the pollution and 
those who made decisions. 
  We do not have such a book, but in France a book has now 
been 
published under the name ``The Chernobyl Incident: A War of 
Rumors.'' On this question there are so many different, 
generally inadequately checked rumors which sometimes result in 
a complete distortion of the physical truth. 
  I emphasize once again that I am answering and am ready to 
answer to any commission for the correctness of the cited data, 
for the fact that our team and I personally did everything for 
this information to reach the people. And I give my word of 
honor to all present that my conscience is clear.'' 
  It is the business of scientists to argue about the accuracy 
of scientific data. It is the business of politicians and 
philosophers to argue about the degree of guilt of an individual 
under conditions of absolute state authority. However, there are 
questions which go beyond these limits. Chernobyl remains 
painful and troublesome in the conscience of each of us, all the 
people and the country. And therefore it is too early to 
consider the doubts expressed at the general meeting to be the 
last word. 
  In actuality, what can a specialist do who knows the truth 
under conditions of total censorship? But today, when the letter 
of P. L. Kapitsa has been made public, both in defense of the 
arrested L. D. Landau and against the suffocation of Baykal and 
against other antihuman deeds of the supreme authority, the 
question about resigning does not seem rhetorical. Who is a 
scientist -- he is only a supplier of new knowledge or data or a 
person whose conscience cannot be at peace with respect to what 
will become of this knowledge, especially if it affects 
everyone, whether it will be made available to the public or 
will be turned into a state secret? 
  We had two principal secrets -- military and ecological. And 
Yuriy Antoniyevich, having available the totality of the precise 
ecological truth, faced with the impossibility of passing it on 
to the people, did not protest and did not resign. He 
beautifully went along with the government in covering up this 
truth. Moreover, he took upon himself the role of an ecological 
czar. Without the permission of his department the press was 
given access to not a single document relative to the alarming 
state of our environment, facts and figures were mercilessly 
stricken out so as ``not to sow panic among the population.'' 
  It is true that in speaking and writing about Chernobyl it 
is 
necessary to separate clearly the scientific facts from the 
phantasmagoria of rumors and wild tales. But indeed the primary 
source of the wild tales themselves was precisely the 
concealment of the truth. One of the arguments was: if the truth 
was told the number of victims -- from panic -- would be still 
greater. How clever. In any case until now there has been no 
direct and honest answer to the question posed by V. P. Maslov: 
what is the price of concealing the truth when reference is to 
what is most important: the life and health of man?

``Financial Indulgences for Scientific-Technical Business''] 
  [Text] In Moscow, a resolution of the government of the 
Russian Federation -- in this case the initiator was the 
Ministry of Science and Technical Policy -- has established a 
fund for facilitating the development of small forms of 
enterprises in the scientific-technical sphere. Its task is 
making financial support available to small business, 
facilitating the development of the innovative infrastructure: 
small companies with an emphasis on science -- incubators of 
business, venture enterprises, engineering centers, industrial 
parks, TOO, companies introducing new scientific products and 
scientific production companies. Assistance will be received by 
those having patents, licenses and know-how, those who want to 
become producers of various specific types of goods production. 
  The fund is concerned with seeking people capable of putting 
competitive products into production. It is not enough, let's 
assume, to propose an apt design for a new type of ball point 
pen, it also is important to become a real owner of a business, 
a full-fledged businessman. 
  The fund is a noncommercial, nonprofit organization, but by 
no means is philanthropic. The inventors of perpetual motion 
machines must cough up payment for a preliminary expert 
evaluation -- 0.1% of the declared estimated cost of the 
project. The applicants for financial support undergo a rigorous 
three-step examination: finalize preparation of the application 
(presentation of a detailed business plan), undergo an expert 
evaluation and win out over competitors in a final competition. 
  For the time being the fund is small: 0.5% of the 
state 
appropriations for science, which is approximately 20 billion 
rubles. If an average of 100-200 million rubles is allocated to 
one scientific-technical project per year, in this case 
financial assistance can be received by only 100-200 competitors 
-- winner of grants. Really not many. because, according to some 
estimates, in order to implement all the scientific and 
technical ideas accumulating in Russia it would be necessary to 
spend several trillion rubles! 
  It is intended that the modesty of the fund budget be 
compensated for in different ways. First of all, the work is to 
be conducted in close collaboration with banking capital. Now 
the conditions for getting money at the bank are severe: 
250-280% interest is charged for a loan and the money is 
usually given not for a year, but only for three months. 
Inflation! Under such conditions for a goods producer, 
especially one arriving from science, the chance of surviving -- 
returning the money and getting a profit -- becomes virtually 
equal to zero. 
  In order to break free from these shackling conditions the 
fund proposes the following. Let's assume that 150 million 
rubles are necessary for a business, 50 million are provided by 
the bank at 300% interest and 100 million are provided by 
the 
bank without interest. Thus, after a year a company highly 
oriented on science should return a total of 200 million rubles 
to the bank. As we see, the conditions for the loan are 
extremely advantageous. The newly established company so- 
to-speak receives a monetary forgiveness of sins -- an unusual 
financial indulgence. 
  Well, and what are the reciprocal advantages from the 
fund-bank alliance? There are several of them. The most 
important thing for the bank is that it receives more than its 
interest. For the bank, now after the careful preliminary expert 
evaluations made by the fund, there is a considerable decrease 
in the probability of subsidizing a future bankruptcy. The fund 
also comes out ahead. First of all, it schools yesterday's 
researchers, for the first time setting out on the slippery 
uneven path of business, to the market, to its severe laws. 
Second, the fund can employ well-organized banking mechanisms 
for recovering sums from organizations which either do not live 
up to the stipulated conditions or are not playing an entirely 
honest game, for example, are taking the money for scientific 
purposes and diverting it for other purposes, trading in 
consumer's goods. 
  The fund has a mutually advantageous link other than with 
banks. Such an organization (Ivan Bortnik, doctor of technical 
sciences, academician of the Russian Engineering Academy, became 
its general director) is striving to establish a partnership 
also with the leaders of regions of the Russian Federation. We 
saw that the fund does not have that much money. It certainly 
does not suffice for the whole of Russia. But it is necessary to 
support all the far reaches of our vast country. The regions 
must create a system of advantageous conditions, a favorable 
climate, for innovative activity by their citizens -- future 
goods producers (knock off taxes, not take payment for power, 
etc.). And at the same time define the range of goods and items 
for which they have an extreme need. The task of the fund, 
moreover, is to assist in establishing companies capable of 
rapid satisfying regional markets with all their needs. 
  Meanwhile, the fund already has received several hundred 
interesting applications. The personnel of the fund (they are 
few in number, only several tens of specialists plus an 
Observing Council, consisting of seven persons, representatives 
of the principal ministries and the Russian Academy of 
Sciences), appointed by the government, are acting efficiently 
and decisively. The funding of companies, winners of competitive 
awards, will not be opened every year, but quarterly. And the 
first funding will begin on 1 July.

  [Abstract] Circulating chromatography is a variant of 
chromatography where the mixture of substances is repeatedly 
passed through a single column or system of columns. Preparative 
circulating liquid chromatography, widely used abroad, employs 
the closed loop principle and is used for separation of 
substances in quantities ranging from milligrams to several 
grams of ultra-pure compounds. While multiple recycling of 
components through a column may separate portions of a mixture, 
such factors as the dead volume of the circulating pump, the 
duct work, dosimeters, and connecting joints become major 
sources of contamination and undesired erosion of the 
chromatographic band. Circulating two cycle chromatography has 
been proposed as an alternative to the closed loop principle of 
chromatography. The two cycle scheme requires no special pumps 
or other elements. The theory of fine separation of binary 
mixtures is expanded to include the possibility of programming 
the length of the sorbent layer and using step-wise 
chromatography. Theoretical analysis and calculations indicate 
that two cycle circulating systems with two columns filled with 
sorbent particles 10-35 microns in diameter provide high 
resolution separation with low pressure drop between the 
columns. Figures 3; references 15: 8 Russian, 7 Western.

  [Abstract] Quasi-liquid membranes may be used in place of 
liquid extraction to concentrate and separate metals. One of the 
shortcomings of membrane extraction is the low reproducibility 
of quasi-liquid membranes. This may be overcome by increasing 
the contact surface of the phases by multiple emulsification or 
by using a different type of module. However, there are other 
ways. When metals are passed through an extraction quasi-liquid 
membrane, maxima are frequently observed on curves representing 
stream size as a function of the concentration of 
carrier-extractant. These maxima represent the presence of 
parallel processes accompanying metal-carrier interaction. 
Basically, these are solution processes having an effect on the 
system viscosity when the coefficient of distribution of the 
metal in the aqueous and organic phases becomes a function of 
both the carrier and the concentration of the solvent. However, 
it is entirely possible that a change in the mechanism of the 
metal transfer takes place within these maxima. In the present 
work IR- Fourier spectroscopy was used to study the extraction 
of cobalt (II) from a hydrochloric acid solution with a 
tri-n-octylamine in decane solution. A marked increase in cobalt 
(II) transport over a narrow interval of extractant-carrier 
during membrane extraction is explained as being due to a change 
in the transport mechanism, hypothetically differing from either 
a diffusion or ``relay'' type mechanism. Figures 3; references 
22: 8 Russian, 14 Western.

  [Abstract] Conjugation in allyl and vinyl compounds of 
heavy elements has been analyzed by quantum chemical methods for 
a rather broad range of hetero-atoms, particularly compounds of 
Groups IV and VII elements. The present work focuses on 
analogous derivatives of Group V elements using semi-empirical 
quantum chemical MNDO methods for computations with parameters 
for nitrogen and phosphorus. Long wave electron transition and 
oscillator energies were calculated for various allyl- and 
vinylamine and allyl- and vinylphosphine conformers. The 
electron structures of these molecules were examined in detail 
and both the spectral and conformational manifestations of 
n,- and ,-conjugation were analyzed. Several 
hypotheses 
are advanced on possible manifestations of conjugation in allyl 
compounds of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. Figures 2;

  [Abstract] Photochemically active poly-functional 
compounds, which may be derived from styryl dyes and contain the 
crown ester group, and capable of selective complex formation 
with metal cations, present great interest. Such selective 
chromogenic crown esters may be used, for example, in the 
colorimetric determination of cations. Furthermore, the 
capability of crown ester-containing styryl dyes to change 
structurally under light makes it possible to consider them as 
elements in photo-switching molecular devices. In the present 
work the synthesis of indole from nitropyridinium salts was 
improved and a method was developed for the synthesis of 
quaternary salts of new indolenine derivatives. The resulting 
indolenine salts condense with formyl derivatives of crown 
esters to styryl series dyes. Photoisomerization and complex 
formation of the crown ester-containing dyes with salts of 
alkali and alkaline earth metals was studied. A correlation was 
found to exist between the magnitude of spectral shift of the 
long wave absorption maximum of the dye, and the size and charge 
density on the metal cation. Figures 3; references 18: 10

  [Abstract] Oxygen-free glasses containing sulfur, selenium, 
tellurium, and other heavy metals are used widely in the optical 
industry and the effluents resulting from production have been 
analyzed in efforts to develop effective measures for lowering 
the toxic metal content. Thus the present work recommends 
determination of Cu(II) and Pb (II) in the presence of other 
heavy elements using the volt-amperometric technique employing a 
crown ester (dibenzo-18-crown-6) modified coal-paste electrode. 
Volt-amperograms were recorded on a PU-1 polarograph and a PO- 
5122 oscillographic polarograph Model 03. Concentration of 
Cu(II) and Pb(II) (as complexes with the crown ester) takes 
place on the surface of the coal paste electrode within 1.0 - 
1.5 minutes. Copper and lead were determined in effluents 
containing Mn(II, III), Fe(II, III), Zn, Ag. Ti, Hg, Ge, Se, and 
Te with a sensitivity lower level of 9.5 X 10 [.sup]-9[/] 
(Cu) and 2 X 10[.sup]-9[/] (Pb) mole per liter. Figures 2; 
references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Powdered iron-nickel alloys are used in magnetic 
recording, relay switch technology, as catalysts, and as 
sintering activators for coarser powders. The traditional 
methods for preparing alloyed ultra-fine (micron and sub-micron) 
powders by reduction of oxalates and decomposition of carbonyls 
are both cumbersome and laborious. In a previous work an attempt 
was made to prepare ultra-fine iron-nickel powders by 
electrolysis in a double layered bath. However, the formation 
conditions and the properties of the resulting powders were not 
well studied. In the present work a study was made of the 
effects of the electrolysis conditions on the rate of formation, 
the yield according to current, the chemical and dispersed 
composition, the specific surface, and the magnetic properties 
of iron-nickel powders as prepared by electrolysis. Analysis of 
the resulting data demonstrates that by correct selection of the 
electrolysis conditions it is possible to prepare iron-nickel 
powders having the required particle size and the desired nickel 
content. Figures 2; references 12: 9 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Anodic oxidation is used widely in 
micro-electronics to make dielectric layers having a 
metal-dielectric-semiconductor structure (MDP). In making an MDP 
based on the intermetallide In-Sb (a p-type semiconductor), the 
dielectric layer 
In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] is 
prepared by anodizing In-Sb in the corresponding electrolytes. 
It is well known that the structure of the anode oxide coating 
is a most important factor which determines its electro-physical 
properties. The properties of the materials may be altered by 
doping the oxide coating. Thus doping the surface layer of 
Nb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] dielectric with indium 
significantly improves the electro-physical properties of the 
system Nb-Nb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-MnO[.sub]2[/]. In 
another work it was demonstrated that the doping elements may 
also be added to the composition of the anode oxide coating by 
including them in the anode reaction in the anode form. In the 
present work a study was made of the effects of niobium 
alcoholate on the process of anode oxidation of the 
semiconductor In-Sb in a glycerate solution of sodium carbonate. 
It was demonstrated that there is an acceleration in the 
formation of the dielectric film 
In[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] when 
doped with niobium ethylate. Possible causes for this 
accelerating effect are discussed. Figures 2; references 6 
(Russian).

  [Abstract] Cathodic surfactants have many useful properties 
such as the capability to inhibit corrosion, act as biocides, 
and the ability to adsorb onto the surfaces of various solid 
substances. These and other properties drew attention to these 
compounds for possible use to prevent corrosion in pipelines. 
This requires a more detailed study of these compounds on steel 
in the cathodic region of potentials. In the present work 
impedenceometry was used to demonstrate that 
N-alkyl-N-methyl-N,N-diethanolamine iodides are adsorbed onto 
the surface of steel in the cathodic region of potentials, 
thereby lowering the volume of electric double layer at the 
metal-coating-electrolyte interfaces. This in turn has a 
significant effect on the rate of cathodic sloughing off of the 
protective polymeric coating and the rate of corrosion of the 
metal being protected. Figures 4; references 13: 7 Russian, 6 
Western.

  [Abstract] Pyromellitic acid dianhydride, a basic source 
for the synthesis of heat resistant insulation materials, is 
obtained industrially by vapor phase oxidation of 
1,2,4,5-tetramethyl benzene (durol). During production, the off 
gases from the oxidation stage are cycloned and vented to the 
atmosphere. These gases contain harmful organic substances in 
both the vapor and dispersed phases. The vapor phase consists 
mainly of durol and its oxidation products, while the dispersed 
phase contains organic dust particles (2.1 microns, average 
size) and consists of pyromellitic acid dianhydride (74-80 
percent), 4,5- methylphthalic (12-14 percent), trimethyl, 
formyltrimellitic, and 4-methylphthalic, acid anhydrides and 
other substances. The dispersed phase is a pyrophoric substance 
which causes combustion and explosions in places where the dust 
accumulates. One of the least energy consuming methods for 
purging the off gases of organic matter is thermocatalysis. In 
the present work a three- stage scheme for treating the off 
gases is examined. The gases are passed sequentially through a 
blender-separator, a plate catalytic reactor, and a fluidized 
bed reactor (iron-chromium oxide catalyst). Design 
characteristics for the equipment and the results of industrial 
testing are presented. The off gases were 50 to 100 percent 
purged of pyromellitic acid dianhydride and other pollutants, 
depending on the operating conditions. Figures 3; references 5

notable improvement thanks to the efforts of scientific and 
production organizations. Top priority has rightly been assigned 
to the study of living nature and food products, water, and air. 
However, in the latter case only the aftereffects of pollution 
are being studied and not their causes and sources. Therefore, a 
specialized geological-economic study has been undertaken of one 
of most active environmental polluters, namely the 
electroplating industry. According to data from the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection, the annual waste within Ukraine 
comprises 550-560 million cubic meters, while the total 
accumulated volume is estimated to be 20 billion cubic meters. 
The greatest contributor is the mining industry which uses only 
12 percent of its output as compared to developed countries 
which use two thirds of the output. The electroplating, 
chemical, radio technical, and electronic industries have 
significantly lower volumes of industrial waste, and therefore 
are not always counted in the inventory. However, it is these 
very wastes which contain significant concentrations of toxic 
and useful metals. It is also important to note that these 
industries are located throughout the entire territory of 
Ukraine, although the substantive composition of the wastes is 
far from being well studied. In one respect this limits the 
possibility of practical utilization of individual valuable 
components, and in another the lack of special sites for storing 
harmful substances results in their being dumped into sewage 
systems or landfills which are harmful to agriculture, surface 
and subterranean waters. Thus the Ukraine State Committee has 
assigned the Ukraine State Committee on Geology and Utilization 
of Minerals to carry out the development of land evaluation of 
industrial enterprises producing toxic metal wastes; 
identification, based on preliminary study of substantive 
composition of wastes which contain high concentrations of 
valuable components, especially metals; develop a listing of 
those enterprises which produce wastes deserving of 
laboratory-technical investigation to provide an evaluation of 
the possibilities and prospects for extracting valuable metals; 
preparation of a list of enterprises whose wastes require 
storage at special sites. In the present work the problems, 
methods and preliminary results of geological-economic study of 
electroplating wastes at the Cherkaskiy and Lvovskiy Oblasts 
were examined and the economic aspects of extracting metals were 
evaluated. Recommendations are provided for conducting further 
research.

  [Abstract] Individual means of protection (SIZ) play an 
especially important role in safeguarding humans in situations 
where there is a danger of interaction with harmful factors 
during production. Various SIZ have been classified according to 
GOST 12.4.011-89 and include 12 classes for hearing organs, 
nose, feet, arms, head, eyes, face, respiratory organs, and for 
falling from heights. At the present time, about 1000 SIZ items 
being are produced and used with varying degrees of protection. 
Effectiveness in using these means and devices depends not only 
on their protective properties, but also on their correct 
selection by taking into account the conditions under which they 
will be used. A decree of the GOSSTANDART established a system 
of certification for individual means of protection in 1993 
which in turn established system structure and an order for 
conducting SIZ certification: starting on 1 Apr 93--SIZ for head 
and respiratory organs; 1 Jul 93--hearing organs, falling from 
heights and insulating garments; 1 Jul 94--feet, arms, SIZ made 
from plastics, and face, eyes, and skin; 1 Jan 95 special 
garments. The principles and order of SIZ certification is 
analogous to that of the European Community standards. A flow 
chart is provided which represents the structural system of the 
certification process. By the second half of 1993 ten 
certificates were issued on SIZ for respiratory organs and nine 
laboratories (centers) were accredited including the ITs [test 
center] ``Sorbotekhn'' and ``EKOTsENTER'' for testing filtration 
devices for respiratory organs (gas masks and anti-dust 
respirators). Figure 1.

  [Abstract] The organization and methodology of 
certification of production of individual means of protection 
(SIZ) are basically the same as for any other type of 
production. Monitoring production for the purpose of 
certification is carried out in accordance with a working 
methodology worked out by organs for the certification of 
production as applied to specific production of a SIZ. The 
methodology specifies the sequence and extent of checking of 
finished production, technological systems, maintenance and 
repair systems, and systems for control and testing. In the 
production of SIZ there are certain special features pertaining 
to the above first and second points. In checking and evaluating 
finished production special attention is devoted to 
registration, analysis and prophylaxis of defects outlined in 
the classifier which an enterprise presents together with other 
initial data needed for certification. In checking and 
evaluating technological systems, special attention is devoted 
to checking special and especially critical technological 
processes (TP). The main TP being checked (operations) on the 
fabrication of parts and assembly units of a production being 
claimed are stated in the methodology and must be stated in the 
list of critical defects outlined in the classifier. The defect 
classifier and list of checked TP (operations) for SIZ for 
respiratory organs are presented as an example.

  [Abstract] Means for individual protection of respiratory 
organs (SIZOD) are used in those cases where equipment design or 
other factors endanger personal safety. The basic requirement of 
a SIZOD is to provide air to a worker that meets sanitary norms. 
In the case of filtering type SIZODs this means an ability to 
treat incoming air in such a way as to bring it to within PDK 
(maximum allowable concentration) levels. An isolating type 
SIZOD must also provide sufficient oxygen. Thus the procedures 
and methods for evaluating SIZODs involve certain special 
considerations. In domestic standards the evaluation methods are 
slanted toward determining how complete the device is in 
preventing harmful substances from entering the respiratory 
organs of a human being and the extent to which the SIZOD can 
maintain this air quality over the period in which it is 
expected to be used. Therefore the following basic conditions 
are regulated: the space velocity of the incoming air stream 
passing through the SIZOD and its components; type and 
concentration of a control substance in the air stream; relative 
humidity of incoming air; nature of the incoming air stream, 
i.e. steady or sinusoidal (simulating breathing); number of 
component parts in the SIZOD subject to testing; duration of 
exposure during testing, the period of time during which a 
control substance penetrates the component; criteria for 
evaluating penetration, methods for determining them, and their 
levels as specified in the evaluation; accuracy and errors of 
the testing equipment. The regulations are covered in GOST 
12.4.034-85 SSBT SIZOD. Some regulations of foreign countries 
are also presented.

  [Abstract] In several species of Lepidoptera related to 
Lasiocampidae, leaf rollers, and real silk worms, conjugated 
_a_, -disubstituted dienes with cis- and trans-double bond 
configurations are characteristic sex pheromone components. 
These also include (7Z,9Z)-7,9 dodecadienyl acetate (Z,Z-1) 
pheromone or a component of pheromone composition. These 
compounds are normally prepared by the Wittig reaction or by 
cross-conjugation of vinyl electrophiles with vinyl nucleophiles 
in the presence of palladium complexes. In the present work a 
study was made of two similar routes to the synthesis of the 
title pheromone using organo-cuprate conjugation of Z,Z-diene 
electrophiles, (2Z,4Z)-1-acetoxy-2,4-heptadiene or 
(3Z,5Z)-1-bromo-3,5-octadiene with 
_o_-ter-butoxy-1-chloropentanome or -butane, respectively. To 
prepare the electrophiles, optimum conditions were determined 
for the reduction of 2,4-hepta- and 3,5-octadiene-1-ols into the 
corresponding Z,Z-alkadienols with activated zinc in a water- 
alcohol medium which facilitated high geometric purity of the 
products. Both schemes result in 1-ter--butoxy-7,9-dodecadiene 
(mixture of four isomers). Acetolysis of the latter results in 
the pheromone with traces of the stereoisomer. References 13: 3

  [Abstract] The chemosorption kinetics of 
alkylchlorosilanes, cyclic and linear organosilanes, and 
trimethylpseudohalides on the surface of pyrogenic silica were 
studied in previous works and a formula was developed which 
adequately describes the process kinetics. In the present work 
additional parameters for this formula were derived for the 
activation energy of the chemosorption of 
(CH[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/]SiX silanes and siloxanes on 
silica surface. The activation energy of electrophilic 
substitution of a hydrogen atom from the silanol groups of the 
surface by these compounds decreases with lowering strength of 
the Si-X bond and increasing inductive constant of the 
substituent X, as well as with decreasing enthalpy of reaction.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``British Television Journalists </F>
Confirm That Russia Has Ball-Sized Neutron Bomb''] 
  [Text] (Reuters) -- Journalists of British television's 
Channel 4 conducted an investigation and came to the conclusion 
that Russian scientists have invented a miniature neutron bomb 
the size of a baseball. The device was created by using what is 
called ``red mercury.'' 
  The bomb's small dimensions make it very attractive to 
terrorists. Dr. Sam Cohen, creator of the American neutron bomb, 
stated, ``This information terrifies me.'' 
  In conventional nuclear weaponry, plutonium is used to 
initiate a thermonuclear reaction. In the Russian device, ``red 
mercury,'' which Russian science discovered 40 years before the 
United States, acts as an igniter. 
  Doctor Cohen supposes that Russian scientists have created a 
bomb no bigger than a baseball. It has a power of 10 metric tons 
of TNT, and its radiation is dispersed over a 600-meter radius, 
destroying everything living and leaving an insignificant 
background after itself. 
  Speculation regarding ``red mercury'' arose not long ago. 
``As far as we know, no unique material called `red mercury' 
exists, stated Great Britain's Ministry of Defense. Materials 
called `red mercury' have been subjected to expert examinations 
and deemed useless.'' 
  When he was in Siberia, Russian ultranationalist 
Zhirinovskiy 
threatened more than once to use the secret weapon ``Elipton'' 
against Bosnian Moslems. 
  Channel 4 television reporters met with scientists in 
Russian 
and traveled to Yekaterinburg, where RM20/20 ``red mercury'' is 
said to be produced at a secret plant. British expert Frank 
Barnabey took part in these conversations and finally came to 
the conclusion, ``I am certain that Zhirinovskiy was telling the 
truth.'' 
  From the editor: For an explanation, IZVESTIYA 
correspondent Nikolay Burbyga turned to the ministries and 
departments that deal with weaponry. 
  ``Of course, we have`` secret developments,'' they said at 
the Ministry of Defense, but what British television reporters 
are stating is totally absurd. You should even be ashamed to 
comment on it.'' 
  The answers obtained at the Kurchatov Institute were no less 
categorical. Specialists involved with prospective scientific 
weaponry developments stated that ``red mercury'' has been 
talked about for a long time. But no one has succeeded in seeing 
it or ``touching'' it because a material with such 
characteristics simply does not exist in nature.

``All England Talking About ``Red Mercury'' and New Russian 
Weapon'': ``The documentary about the new secret weapon of mass 
destruction that has apparently been created in Russia and shown 
on British television's Channel 4 is being discussed in 
London''] 
  [Text] London -- The portable bomb that is barely the size 
of a teacup or ball is apparently capable of destroying 
everything living within the radius of a modern large city or 
rayon. 
  The British have been working on gathering material about 
this for an entire 18 months, trying to find confirmation of the 
rumors that have long roused the Western press to the effect 
that ``red mercury,'' whose very existence is denied by 
scientific-technical experts, is being brought in from Russia by 
some sort of secret contraband channels. 
  No, states G. Roberts, the leader of the narrative in the 
sensational English television investigation, this substance is 
not a myth. It is the main component in the ``pure'' 
thermonuclear bomb that was apparently made in Russia and no 
where else in the world. True, his Russian partners in 
conversation generally remain anonymous on the topic of ``red 
mercury,'' and their evidence does not, it must be confessed, 
sound too convincing. 
  The attempt to obtain responsible and knowledgeable 
commentators ultimately led the film's authors to Yekaterinburg, 
where they uncovered a plot very reminiscent of the old James 
Bond hits: secret meetings at twilight with some unknown persons 
who initially promised to provide the necessary information but 
disappeared at the last moment, afraid of the consequences. 
  Nevertheless, the group from England was apparently able to 
obtain secrets about a weapon that may become a new, even more 
terrifying threat for all mankind. They met with Russian 
scientists who had evidently themselves been personally involved 
in working on this project for 5 years. In any case, the film's 
consultants were convinced of the soundness of this evidence. 
  Another prominent expert in nuclear physics, the American 
professor Cohen, stated that as far as can be judged based on 
the materials gathered by the British television team, American 
scientists are lagging very much behind their Russian colleagues 
in this area. In Cohen's opinion, the spread of nuclear weaponry 
in the world will surely be impossible to contain. 
  The broadcast's finale was an interview with the director of 
a large German firm. The said participant announced that he has 
personal knowledge of sales of ``red mercury'' from Russia so 
large that they terrify him. 
  A Russian Federation Ministry of Defense representative 
denied the suggestion of the existence of either ``red mercury'' 
or a new ``mini-bomb'' created on its basis (see IZVESTIYA, No. 
70).

  [Abstract] The CVD method of chemical deposition from the 
vapor phase, used widely to prepare high temperature 
superconductor film, is easy to control, has a high film growth 
rate, makes it possible to obtain high quality films on large 
areas and complex substrates, and provides high temperature 
superconductor films with perfect surface structures without 
additional high temperature calcining. One of the most important 
problems arising in chemical precipitation from the vapor phase 
is the selection of volatile compounds which may be converted 
into the vapor phase and recondensed without change in 
composition. Low polarity compounds having a covalent bond 
between the metal atom and the ligand are the most volatile. The 
molecules of the complex must not interact with each other or 
with other compounds. Metal complexes with _b_-diketones are 
frequently used as starting materials having acceptable 
volatility to form fine superconducting films from the vapor 
phase. In the present work a study was made of the effect the 
structure of the ligand and the nature of the metal have on the 
volatility of the complexes used to prepare superconductor films 
having the composition Y-Ba-Cu-O and Bi-Sr-Ca-Cu-O by using the 
CVD method. Values are presented on the thermodynamic 
characteristics of vaporization of the above compounds, their 
heat and temperature of sublimation, and conditions for thermal 
decomposition and storage. References 60: 19 Russian, 41 Western.

  [Abstract] The use of luminescent chelates of rare earth 
elements as active additives to polymers requires stabilization 
of the luminescent site in the polymer matrix as well as an 
increase in the thermal and photo resistance of these polymers. 
It therefore seemed expedient to prepare and study the 
spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of complexes 
of rare earth elements with polymers. Only a few works on this 
problem have been published. In the present work a study was 
made of spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of 
Eu(III) complexes with copolymers of acrylic acid and esters of 
methacrylic acid. The photochemical behavior of the 
macromolecular complexes was observed to be markedly different 
from the properties of the low molecular analogs, e.g. during 
photo-decomposition the luminescent intensity of 
Eu[.sup]3+[/] does not diminish, but rather increases 
noticeably. The effectiveness of Eu[.sup]3+[/] luminescent 
glow is a function of the composition and structure of the 
initial macromolecular complex. A low metal concentration, low 
acrylic acid content, and an increase in the length of the alkyl 
radical on the methacrylate facilitate intensification of the 
effectiveness of luminescent glow of the rare earth ion. Figures

  [Abstract] Low melting point oligomers are used in 
photo-thermoplastic recording as a recording medium. An electric 
charge placed on a film of such material remains intact in 
darkness and diminishes under illumination. The remaining charge 
in unlit portions of the film is capable of deforming the film 
when heated to a temperature above the flow point, thereby 
forming an image. In the present work linear and radial 
(star-like) carbazole-containing oligomers, used as recording 
means for photo-thermoplastics, were synthesized. The 
coefficients of molecular packing of the synthesized oligomers 
were determined, and it was demonstrated that on transition from 
the linear to the radial (three and four rays) form, the 
coefficient of molecular packing decreases and the fraction of 
free space increases. This confirms the branched structure of 
the radial form. References 5 (Russian).

  [Abstract] It is extremely difficult to quantitatively 
determine the extent of destruction in a polymer. Determination 
of an accurate value by direct computation of change in average 
molecular weight is also complex. Therefore, it is more 
expedient to use other average molecular weight values, such as 
average viscosity and average weight. However, an estimate of 
rupture density of this type may be executed simply only for 
some particular molecular weight distribution, e.g. Flory 
distribution. For any other molecular weight distribution the 
problem becomes significantly more difficult, owing to the 
change in form in molecular weight distribution during the 
destruction. In the present work a generalized formula advanced 
by Charlseby is examined. With this formula, it is demonstrated 
that for a given polymer having an initial Schultz distribution, 
the computation may be completed only for a limited interval of 
index of destruction values, and this interval becomes narrower 
as the index of distribution increases. This formula is not 
suitable for logarithmic-normal distribution. Figures 2; 
references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The preparation of thin films by dissociation of 
metal-organic compounds is finding applications in 
micro-electronics. This method may also be used to prepare 
recording media for optical information carriers. Systems where 
the metal is included in the hydrocarbon matrix are particularly 
promising. The precipitation processes and the properties of the 
resulting polymer films are affected by such parameters as 
pressure, flow rate of the organo-metallic compound, temperature 
of the substrate, and energy characteristics of the low 
temperature plasma, which depend greatly on the type of 
discharge. In the present work a study was made of the processes 
for preparing thin films by dissociation of tetramethyl Sn in a 
high frequency discharge and in a direct current discharge. 
Differences in the Raman spectra of the tetramethyl Sn in the 
liquid and film states were established, and precipitation 
conditions were determined under which the resulting films have 
maximum sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio for use as 
recording media for optical recording of information. Figures 2; 
references 6 (Russian).

541.64:546.659:547.571] 
  [Abstract] For the first time, polypinacols were 
synthesized by reacting aromatic dialdehydes with samarium 
iodide under mild conditions. Tere- and isophthalic aldehydes 
and bis-(3-hydro-formyl-2,4,6-trimethylphenyl(methane) [BHPM] 
that had been purified by vacuum sublimation were used as 
starting monomers. Terephthalic aldehyde was reacted with 
SmI[.sub]2[/] in tetrahydrofuran [THF] in an argon 
atmosphere. Hydrolysis was performed with diluted hydrochloric 
acid. A study of the effect of temperature on the reaction in 
the temperature interval from -25 to +65C demonstrated that 
a portion of the aldehyde groups do not participate in the 
reaction at low temperatures (from -25 to -20C). Increasing 
the reaction temperature to 5-7C results in a slight 
increase in the polymer's logarithmic viscosity; however, once 
again not all the aldehyde groups are involved in the 
condensation. Finally, when the temperature is increased all the 
way to 65C, it is possible to obtain a polymer of the 
desired structure (i.e., a polymer with no absorption band at 
1,680 cm[.sup]-1[/] and intensive absorption bands at 
3,400-3,500 cm[.sup]-1[/]). The polymer's molecular weight 
also increases slightly as the reaction temperature is raised; 
however, the solubility in organic solvents of the polymer 
synthesized at 65C is significantly diminished. The said 
polymers only dissolve upon protracted heating in amide-type 
solvents and lose their solubility when the duration of the 
synthesis process at 65C is increased to several hours 
(evidently on account of cross-linking at the hydroxyl groups). 
The noticeable ash (samarium) content in the reaction products 
was also deemed attention worthy. Increasing the concentration 
of dialdehyde dissolved in the THF from 0.05 to 0.50 mol/l did 
not result in any increase in the polymers' viscosity 
characteristics but did increase the tendency toward formation 
of coordination compounds with samarium (even those products 
purified by reprecipitation contained samarium). The 
polypinacols obtained from other dialdehydes and 
SmI[.sub]2[/] under similar conditions were found to contain 
carbon and hydrogen in quantities corresponding to the 
theoretically calculated amount and no ash at all. This finding 
was attributed to the fact that side processes expending OH 
groups are suppressed as a result of steric factors and because 
of the fact that the mutual effect of the aldehyde groups in 
such cases is weak. The said compounds also had a lower 
molecular weight than the polymers formed from terephthalic 
aldehyde. This lower molecular weight was attributed to the 
lower concentration of starting monomer on account of its 
limited solubility in THF. The newly synthesized polymers on the 
basis of BHPM were white powder materials, and those synthesized 
on the basis of tere- and isophthalic aldehydes were yellow 
powders. All had an amorphous structure, a softening temperature 
of 160 to 190C, and a 5 percent mass loss in air at 
200-230C. The polypinacols based on BHPM had the lowest 
softening points and temperature of onset of heat destruction. 
All of the newly synthesized polymers were distinguished by 
their solubility in a number of organic solvents (those based on 
BHPM were soluble in chloroform and even acetone), and all were 
interesting as functional compounds from the standpoint of 
subsequent synthesis of derivatives at their hydroxyl groups 
(e.g., by reaction with isocyanates, etc., coordination with 
organometallic compounds, and synthesis of poly-_a_-diketones 
via oxidation). The possibility of modifying the newly 
synthesized compounds by reacting them with aldehydes to form 
polymers that are easily soluble in various organic solvents was 
demonstrated. Tables 2; references 13: 5 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] Crazed substrates were produced by using 
nonoriented polyethylene terephthalate [PETP] (meeting 
specification TU 6-19-138-79) and polypropylene (meeting state 
standard GOST 26996-86 and specification TU 01020) films with 
thicknesses of about 100 m. The semifinished products were 
stretched until a specified deformation was achieved and then 
dried while held with clamps or left free. Alkyl siloxane-type 
organosilicon compounds were then used as a filler for producing 
quasi-liquid membranes. The filler was incorporated into the 
substrate by replacing the crazing medium. This was done by 
stretching amorphous PETP in n-propranol, releasing it from the 
clamps, and transferring it into polymethylsiloxane [PMS] or 
polyethylsiloxane [PES] fluid. After several minutes it 
completely replaced the propranol in the crazes' micropores. Not 
all the PMS fluids used proved to be suitable fillers. The 
highly volatile ones (e.g., PMS-10) lost up to 50 percent of 
their mass in the first 4 days of storage. As a result, PMS with 
only very slight volatility (e.g., PMS-20 and PMS-100) were used 
along with PES-5 and fractioned oligodimethylsiloxanes. Samples 
of quasi-liquid membranes retained their dimensions after months 
of storage. The permeability of the quasi-liquid membranes with 
PMS or PES fillers was thousands of times greater than that of 
films of amorphous PETP with a selectivity of 
_a_[.sub]02/N2[/] = 2.2 to 2.4. Furthermore, the parameters 
characterizing the newly synthesized quasi-liquid membranes were 
on a par with those of Silar-type block copolymers, and their 
mechanical properties even surpassed those of block copolymers. 
As anticipated, the quasi-liquid membranes with the more viscous 
filler (PMS-100) had lower permeabilities because of the 
decrease in the coefficient of diffusion of gas in a liquid as 
that liquid's viscosity increases. A mechanism of active gas 
transfer was used to increase the quasi-liquid membranes' 
selectivity. Through directed alteration of the crazing 
mechanism, the researchers were able to obtain microporous 
materials with improved permeability. Decreasing the thickness 
of the working layer of quasi-liquid membrane and using polymers 
with a high permeability were said to be the simplest ways of 
further increasing the performance characteristics of crazed 
quasi-liquid membranes. Figures 4, table 1; references 22: 11

  [Abstract] Chemical analysis of materials by the x-ray 
fluorescence method, such an analysis being based on the 
relation between intensity I of fluorescence and the chemical 
composition C of the test specimen. The original version was 
trial analysis with use of a model without calibrating specimens 
(J. Criss, L. Birks; ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY, Vol. 40 No. 7, 1968). 
This simple procedure has been later found to be inadequate (R. 
Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 15 No. 3, 1986), inasmuch as 
no one mathematical model would simulate the reflection pattern 
accurately enough under any circumstances. One of the proposed 
modifications of this method was to determine the instrument 
errors and to reconcile experimental data with theory (R. 
Tertian; X-RAY SPECTROMETRY, Vol. 17 No. 3, 1988), but this 
required use of standard specimens and complicated the 
procedure. The method of fundamental parameters was proposed 
next, first on the conventional premise that determining the 
entire composition would require a preliminary separate 
determination of the lighter elements by some other method. 
Simpler variants of this method, especially effective in partial 
determinations, are empirical ones using coherent and 
noncoherent reflection of incident light by the analyzed 
specimen. Another variant of this method is approximating the 
equation I[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/] (i= 1,2,... constituent 
chemical elements in the material) by expanding the function 
C[.sub]i[/]/I[.sub]i[/] into a Taylor series: 
C[.sub]i[/]= C[.sub]i[/]*(1 + _s_ 
_a_[.sub]ij[/]'_D_C[.sub]j[/], where C[.sub]i[/]*= 
f(I[.sub]i[/] and _D_C[.sub]j[/]= C[.sub]j[/]- 
C[.sub]j,c[/] (C[.sub]j[/], C[.sub]j,c[/]- 
concentration of j-th significant element in analyzed specimen 
and in reference specimen respectively, _a_[.sub]ij[/]'- 
differential coefficient characterizing influence of element j 
on the intensity of fluorescence of i-th element). Several 
mathematical models have been proposed for implementation of 
this method, each with a generally different value of each 
coefficient _a_[.sub]ij[/] and different expression for 
_a_[.sub]ij[/]*= _a_[.sub]ij[/]+ _D__a_[.sub]ij[/] but 
all taking into account, though also differently, the dependence 
of _a_[.sub]ij[/] on C and on the analyzer geometry. Listed 
are six of them: 1) Claisse-Quintin, 2) Tertian, 3) 
Lachance-Claisse, 4) Rassberry-Heinrich, 5) Broll-Tertian, 6) 
Rousseau. Tables 1; references 160.

  [Abstract] A technology of automatic pH control by the 
volt-ampere method with a hard indicator electrode has been 
developed at the Institute's electrochemical laboratory for 
monitoring the reactants participating in gold extraction from 
pulp. As reactants are being used thiourea or sodium cyanide. 
Two transducer configurations are proposed, one with a bar 
electrode in an epoxy sleeve and one with a long enamel-coated 
wire electrode. As the electrode material have been selected 
graphite for use with thiourea and graphite or copper for use 
with sodium cyanide. A graphite electrode is also used for 
monitoring iron in FeSO[.sub]4[/] solution (Fe++ Fe+++ 
oxidation reaction) and for monitoring gold in thiourea or NaCN 
solution. Both electrodes are renewable ones, purity being 
restored by mechanically slicing off a thin surface layer. The 
electrical conductivity of the reactants is usually adequate for 
accurate measurements, especially when some 
H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/] has been added. The operating 
ranges are: 5-20C for copper electrode with NaCN, 
10-40C for graphite electrode with NaCN, 20-50C for 
graphite electrode with thiourea. Each transducer includes an 
electronic circuit for compensating the effect of temperature 
fluctuations within those ranges. For monitoring the gold 
content has been devised the inverse volt-ampere method, to 
either replace or supplement conventional method of atomic 
absorption spectrometry. The analyzer with any of the two 
transducers operates with direct current in either the straight 
mode or the differential mode, recording the current at the 
instant when the analytical signal peaks. It includes a 
regulator of the electrode renewal cycle needed for polarization 
and measurements of the variable voltage. The apparatus, built 
at the by the Scientific-Industrial Association 
``Soyuzalmazozolotoavtomatika'' (All-Union Diamond and Gold 
Automation), has successfully passed lengthy tests in a gold 
extraction plant. Tables 1; references 15.

  [Abstract] Degradation processes were studied in silicon 
carbide refractories exposed to high-temperature gas streams. 
Fired and unfired specimens were made from powders with grain 
sizes ranging from Nos. 3-125. The fired specimens were made 
with either a silica or a nitride binder, or they were 
siliconized (10-15% carbon in the refractory mass and 
firing in 
silicon vapors), and silica glass, bentonite, ferrosilicon, and 
boron carbide were added to impart strength to the silica binder 
and inhibit SiC oxidation. The unfired specimens were made with 
Bakelite binder polymerized at 180-200C. Specimens of each 
type of refractory with select physical and mechanical 
properties were tested in a high- temperature (2650-2730 K) and 
velocity (2300 m/s with a 1.2 air- fuel ratio) gas stream 
created by igniting alcohol in oxygen (nearly 13% 
O[.sub]2[/]). Test duration was 15 s, which is much shorter 
than usual for this type of test. The specimens were 
cylindrical, 50 mm long and 20-25 mm in diameter. Change in 
specimen height during the 15-second test period was recorded 
photographically. Oxidation of the SiC with the formation of 
SiO, SiO[.sub]2[/], and CO was the main process resulting in 
a dramatic alteration of the composition and properties of the 
specimens in the layer below the one exposed to the gas stream. 
The degradation processes occurred at the fastest rate within 
the first 5 s, after which the rate stabilized. The silica 
binder specimens had the greatest specimen height and mass loss 
rates (0.88 and 1.92 average specimen height loss, in mm/s, and 
degradation rate, in kg/sq m x s, respectively), followed by the 
siliconized specimens (0.85 and 2.46) and those made with the 
nitride (0.77, 1.81) or Bakelite binder (0.68, 1.63). The latter 
also had less SiC oxidation and a correspondingly lower 
proportion of SiO[.sub]2[/] in the layer concerned. Figures 
9, tables 5; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] A new lime refractory production process that 
utilizes titanium oxide as the sintering additive was proposed. 
TiO[.sub]2[/] was selected because the eutectic temperature 
of CaO-TiO[.sub]2[/] is 2010 K and because calcium titanates 
are resistant to atmospheric hydrolysis. The refractory is made 
by pulverizing pure or esp. pure calcium carbonate to a particle 
size of 100-150 m and adding 2-6% TiO[.sub]2[/] or 2-4% 

titanium ferrite. (Optimum additive percentage was determined 
empirically.) A 5-% aqueous solution of sulfite waste 
liquor 
with a density of 1.15 g/sq cm is used as the binder. The green 
mass is then pressed into briquets and fired at 2020 K. The lime 
refractory material has an apparent density of 2.75-3.03 g/cu 
cm, apparent porosity of 3.4-9.8%, compressive strength of 
60-140 N/sq mm, and a loaded deformation temperature of 1610 to 
1700C or higher. Figures 5, tables 1; references 5: Russian.

  [Abstract] The alloying of silicon carbide components with 
aluminum was studied to determine its effect on component 
structure and electrical properties. Three tubular specimens 
were extruded from an 85 wt. % primary SiC (SiC') mass and 
fired in a siliconizing packing at temperatures between 
1900-2200C for 5.5 to 6 h in a resistance furnace. During 
firing, the specimens were arranged in a symmetrical fashion 
relative to the tubular graphite heating element. Sintering of 
the green extrusions and structural formation was more readily 
effected by the addition of process carbon to the raw material 
and by the formation of carbon residue released during 
thermopyrolysis of the binder. These carbons, together with the 
carbide-forming elements present in the packing, helped to form 
secondary SiC (SiC''). In order to alloy the SiC with aluminum, 
an aluminous substance was also added to the packing. After they 
had cooled, the specimens were fired a second time. It was found 
that this method of forming SiC components creates a layered 
structure in which SiC'' grains are alloyed with aluminum, and 
that this structure promotes consistent electrical resistivity 
throughout the component cross-section. The degree of alloying 
can be monitored by X-ray microspectrometry. Electrical 
resistivity can be estimated within the framework of a 
generalized model of conductivity in a multi-component medium, 
in which SiC forms a continuous matrix, and SiC' grains make up 
a discrete phase. Figures 2, tables 1; references 11: 9 Russian,

  [Abstract] Cerium dioxide-tantalum oxide ceramic material 
was studied to determine the combined effects of a gaseous 
atmosphere and the tantalum oxide alloy on its electrical 
conductivity. More than 99.8% pure cerium dioxide and 
tantalum 
oxide powders were mixed to form compositions in which the 
proportion of tantalum oxide was 0.5, 2.3, or 5%. The 
powders 
were then briquetted, fired at 1870C for 5 h to synthesize 
a solid solution, and re- pulverized to obtain fractions from 
0.65 to less than 0.05 mm. Bar-shaped specimens 7 x 7 x 70 mm 
were compacted at 100 N/sq mm from tri-fraction mixtures of the 
powders and fired at 1820 K for 6 h. The fired specimens had an 
apparent porosity of 18-20% and a total porosity of 
20-22%. 
Electrical conductivity was measured with four PR-30 
platinum-rhodium probes utilizing direct current. In the first 
series of tests, the specimens were exposed to atmospheric air, 
and in the next series of tests, to an atmosphere of combustion 
products created by igniting propane in oxygen at air-fuel 
ratios of 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2. It was found that alloying cerium 
dioxide with tantalum oxide greatly increases the material's 
conductivity in air (to the solid solution saturation point). 
Unalloyed cerium dioxide ceramics exposed to combustion products 
have a much higher electrical conductivity than those exposed to 
atmospheric air. Moreover, the lower the air-fuel ratio, the 
higher the conductivity. Alloying cerium dioxide lowers the 
sensitivity of the conductivity of this material to the 
composition of the gaseous atmosphere of combustion products, 
especially for saturated solutions of tantalum oxide in cerium 
oxide. Figures 4; references 3: Russian.

  [Abstract] Non-destructive methods of assessing the 
physical and mechanical properties of refractory products are 
being more widely used in place of destructive testing methods 
throughout the refractories industry and by end-users of 
refractory products to ensure 100% quality control. The 
Novomoskva refractories plant is using x-ray analysis to detect 
inclusions, variation in wall thickness, graphite distribution, 
and internal defects such as cracks and splits in the refractory 
components of continuous casting machines. Radio-frequency 
inspection methods are being used primarily to measure porosity. 
Various acoustical methods, such as the shadow and echo methods 
and acoustical emission, are being used extensively by U.S., 
Japanese, and European firms for specific applications. For 
example, acoustical emission is being successfully used to 
assess deformation and destruction mechanisms and heat 
resistance. The echo method is used to detect internal cracks 
and cavities and to measure wear and the useful thickness of 
linings in thermal processing equipment. Ultrasound is being 
used in conjunction with physical measurements to measure the 
strength of a refractory material or product. Acoustical 
resonance is being used at the Vnukov refractories plant to 
measure density, porosity, and the mechanical strength of the 
plate linings of slide valves. These methods are highly accurate 
and reproducible and enable refractories producers to effect 
substantial savings in quality control costs while enabling 
end-users to avoid costly equipment failures. Figures 3;

  [Abstract] Experiments were performed to determine the 
factors affecting the service life of dinas linings in oxygen- 
process steelmaking vessels. Laboratory specimens were formed 
from 100% Ovruch quartzite on a laboratory hydraulic press 
under 50 N/sq mm of pressure and fired at 1360, 1380, and 
1420C for 6 h to effect different degrees of quartz 
degeneration. Two different compositions, No. 1 and No. 2, were 
formulated, depending on the additives used in the refractory 
mass. For both compositions, density decreased while apparent 
porosity and compressive strength increased as the firing 
temperature increased. The greatest proportion of residual 
quartz was found in the refractory compositions fired at 
1360C, and dinas No. 1 had more residual quartz than dinas 
No. 2. Therefore, dinas specimens fired at this temperature were 
used throughout the rest of the study. Thermal resistance was 
determined by measuring the thermal expansion coefficient, 
thermal conductivity, bending strength, and shear modulus of the 
dinas at temperatures ranging from 20 to 1300C. These data 
showed that the thermal resistance of the specimens sharply 
increased as the average temperature increased, especially at 
temperatures above 600C. Moreover, dinas No. 1 had greater 
thermal resistance than dinas No 2. The slag resistance of the 
dinas specimens was then tested by drilling a hole through the 
center of the cube-shaped test specimens, heating them in a 
Kryptol furnace to a temperature of 1670C, and allowing 
melted slag of typical composition to drip through the hole. The 
same test was performed on specimens of DM industrial dinas and 
MKV-72 mullite-fused alumina. The specimens were then 
cross-sectioned and the area of slag impregnation measured. 
Dinas No. 1 specimens had the greatest slag resistance; 
25% of 
their area was penetrated by the slag. Dinas No. 2 specimens had 
30% of their area penetrated by slag, and the other 
refractory 
specimens were completely impregnated. Petrographic analysis of 
specimen cross- sections revealed the presence of a distinct 
three-zone structure consisting of a least-changed zone, a 
transitional zone, and a reaction zone. The experimental data 
were used by the Krasnogorov refractories plant to manufacture a 
test batch of standard-size dinas lining materials, which were 
tried out in the 0.3-t laboratory steelmaking vessel at the 
Institute of Ferrous Metallurgy. Blowing time was 10-12 min., 
and the average post- blowing melt temperature ranged from 1600 
to 1720C, averaging 1660C. In comparison with the DM 
dinas and MKV-72 linings, dinas No. 1 proved to have the 
greatest overall resistance to the erosive effects of the 
blowing process in every respect and in nearly every section of 
the vessel, except for the cylindrical part and the throat, 
where the MKV-72 was better. The dinas lining also eroded more 
uniformly than the other linings. The lining wear pattern was 
typical for that of oxygen process steelmaking vessels. 
Depending on process temperatures and times, the maximum wear 
rate of dinas linings should be comparable to that of basic 
refractory linings. It is anticipated that considerable 
economies in raw materials and improvements in steel quality 
will be realized by converting to acid refractory linings such 
as dinas in oxygen- process steelmaking. Figures 2, tables 5.

  [Abstract] Results were presented from a technical and 
economic assessment of using various types of metallurgical 
waste in the production of refractory materials. 
Magnesia-silicate slags from the Serov ferroalloy plant were 
used to produce periclase- spinellid-forsterite linings for the 
anode furnace of the Kyshtym electrolytic plant. These linings 
were comparable in durability to chromite-periclase linings. 
Forsterite-spinel heating furnace bottoms for the Chelyabinsk 
forging press and forsterite-spinellid teeming vessels for the 
Chelyabinsk metallurgical combine were made from high-carbon 
ferrochromium slag at the Magnesite plant. The furnace bottoms 
were 2-4 times more durable than those made with conventional 
raw materials, and the teeming vessels were as durable as 
periclase-graphite vessels. Use of these slags is calculated to 
save 2.1 million rubles per annum in raw materials costs and 157 
thousand rubles per year in savings from reduced environmental 
damage. Savings from transporting and storing these wastes is 
expected to be 96.5 thousand rubles annually. The formulas used 
to arrive at these figures are presented, and other examples of 
refractories produced using metallurgical wastes are discussed.

  [Abstract] With application of the theory of a thin shock 
layer the article gives a formulation of the problem and a 
method for solution of the problem of optimization of wings with 
a short elongation in a hypersonic flow and at different angles 
of attack, the objective being ensuring a maximum aerodynamic 
quality. As a result of a parametric numerical study it was 
found that the optimum solution has two branches and the 
optimization process has a bifurcation character: with some wing 
span value there is a jumplike switch from one branch of the 
solution to another, accompanied by a fundamental change in the 
appearance of the optimized wing. The characteristic 
configurations of optimum wings are illustrated. An appreciable 
gain in hypersonic quality is obtained in a wide range of angles 
of attack. An algorithm is proposed for computing pressure in 
the inverse problem of streamline flow with a given form of 
jump. The pressure distributions on the surface of optimum wings 
are studied. Computations of aerodynamic forces are made by 
direct integration of pressure, making it possible to refine the 
maximum hypersonic quality value, which proved to be greater 
than that found by the authors earlier using an approximate 
formula. This article represents a continuation of earlier work 
along these same lines by the same authors (``Optimization of 
Spatial Configuration of Supporting Surfaces With Short 
Elongation at Hypersonic Velocities,'' ZH. VYCHISL. MATEM. I 
MATEM. FIZ., Vol. 31, No. 12, pp 1858-1870, 1991; ``Increasing 
Aerodynamic Quality of Wings With a Short Elongation at 
Hypersonic Velocities,'' PRIKL. MATEM. I MEKHAN., Vol. 56, No. 
3, pp 392-403, 1992) and draws heavily on these materials.

  [Abstract] Experimental studies were made of the generation 
of a relativistic electron beam and pulsed microwave radiation 
using the energy of chemical explosives. The microwave generator 
used was a highly precise relativistic generator based on a 
triode with a virtual cathode. The energy of a strong 
relativistic beam is transformed with an efficiency up to 
30-40% into the energy of an electromagnetic field with 
the 
oscillatory motion of electrons in a potential well created by 
the real and virtual cathodes. High-voltage explosive-magnetic 
generators with interception of the magnetic flux, which are fed 
by spiral explosive-magnetic generators, were developed for 
transforming the explosion energy into electromagnetic energy. 
The matching of the impedances of the explosive-magnetic 
generators and the relativistic generator, as well as the 
shaping of the necessary form of the electric pulse, was 
accomplished using electroexplosive current interrupters. As a 
result, voltage pulses up to 600 kV with a steepness of the 
leading edge about 60 ns are sent to the relativistic generator; 
the amplitude of the current across the triode attained 16 kA. 
The peak power of the microwave radiation sent into the 
atmosphere was not less than 100 MW. A model of operation of 
system elements is proposed. The experimental apparatus is 
described in detail. It is shown that the theoretical 
computations are reasonably consistent with experimental data.

  [Abstract] Retouch of surfaces for compensation of 
aberrations in real optical systems producing a diffractional 
image is considered, the r.m.s. error of residual wavefront 
aberrations at some point of the field being serving as the 
criterion of compensation quality at that point. The problem is 
to minimize the functional &PSgr;= (1/m)_s_[RMS](i)[.sup]2[/] 
(i= 1,...,m) representing the integral compensation quality 
criterion. The problem is solved for an objective with wave 
aberrations W[.sub]i[/](x,y) at points i= 1,...,m and their 
decrement _D_W[.sub]i[/](x,y) as a result of retouch at these 
points in the (x,y) plane. For simplicity but without loss of 
generality, all mean aberrations and their mean decrements are 
assumed to be zero in the pupil. The retouch profile is 
represented by a set of analytical functions, preferably 
polynomial power functions with coefficients 
_a_[.sub]1,...,n[/]. An exact numerical solution is very 
laborious, especially so because the light rays must be tracked 
through a system with nonaxisymmetric errors of surface 
treatment. Applying the theory of small perturbations is shown 
to simplify the problem and an ``approximate optimization'' in 
accordance with that theory is proposed, the necessary condition 
for functional &PSgr; to be zero being that its all its partial 
derivatives with respect to coefficients _a_[.sub]j[/] (j= 
1,...,n) be zero. This condition &PSgr;/_a_[.sub]j[/] (j= 

1,...,n) yields a system of m integrodifferential equations, a 
zero sum of m surface integrals, which is solved by seeking 
_D_W[.sub]0[/] as a series in linearly-independent function 
_ps_[.sub]k[/] (k= 1,...n. The algorithms of 
compensation by retouch calculations according to this method 
have been programmed for an IBM -PC/AT computer, the RETOUCH 
program consisting of five steps: 1) calculating the profile of 
axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric retouch, 2) representing the 
results in the form of tables and on graphs, 3) evaluating and 
analyzing the residual aberrations, 4) prediction of the 
contrast at all points where interferograms have been processed 
and estimating the effectiveness of retouch, 5) filing the 
retouch profile in the form of a two-dimensional power 
polynomial in the INTERF program format. The procedure is 
demonstrated on a high-resolution objective. Figures 1; tables

  [Abstract] Recognition of three-dimensional objects on a 
perspective image of a real locale is examined, the process 
involving detection and subsequent identification of an a'priori 
known object on a real image possibly much larger than that 
object. The basic procedure is to construct a reference image of 
the sought object and then find the latter on a large image. 
Inasmuch as it is not otherwise feasible to store reference 
images covering the entire gamut of conditions (aspect, position 
of light source, focal length of lens, resolution), automatic 
recognition by means of three-dimensional computer graphics is 
being resorted to so that both the locale and the shape of an 
object can be described mathematically in a form readily 
yielding quasi-photographic likenesses under practically any 
conditions. Successful computer-aided simulation of reference 
images requires storing in the computer memory not the numerous 
reference images of the sought object but only its shape and 
optical characteristics, a single reference image then being 
generated by a synthesizer under predetermined conditions. The 
procedure is demonstrated on automatic object detection and 
recognition with the aid of video sensors on an aircraft in 
flight. For reconstruction of a whole scene, each individual 
three-dimensional object or group of objects is fictitiously 
enveloped with a convex polyhedral shell. As an example is 
considered a hexahedral shell with the base on the ground, the 
parallel to it roof in the air, and the lateral four other faces 
of equal height h in vertical position. The calculations are 
programmed so that the width of the shell will, depending on the 
sun's position, automatically increase so as to optimally 
envelop not only the three-dimensional object but also its 
two-dimensional shadow. For this purpose the computer solves a 
system of four equations in space coordinates 
X[.sub]i[/],Y[.sub]i[/] of the four base vertices i= 1(1)4 
and space coordinates X[.sub]sun[/], 
Y[.sub]sun[/],Z[.sub]sun[/] of the sun, with the height h 
of 
the shell given. The algorithm of image synthesis yields first 
an image of the entire locale without objects in it and then 
adds zone-by-zone the images of objects, including their shadows 
and other graphically describable items, each within its 
fictitious enveloping shell. The algorithm includes also 
calculation of the image brightness based on information about 
the brightness of pixels, unless Nyquist's rule is observed and 
the space frequency of readout from the discretized locale image 
is accordingly at least twice as high than the spatial 
discretization frequency of that image. Figures 7; references 5.

  [Abstract] Minimizing the threshold temperature difference 
detectable by infrared imaging is considered, the detectable 
temperature difference being the principal performance 
characteristic of an infrared receiver and its minimum threshold 
being theoretically attainable in the absence of atmospheric 
noise and background interference. The noise equivalent 
temperature difference (NETD) is represented as the product of 
three terms containing the radiation wavelength, both focal 
length and diameter of the objective, the surface area of a 
photosensitive element, and the photoelectron storage time, also 
the numerical spectral density of photons emitted by an absolute 
black body and a parameter characterizing the degeneracy of the 
photon flux emitted by an absolute black body at a temperature 
T. It has been assumed here that objects within the field of 
vision radiate heat as if they were absolute black bodies, that 
the diameter of the objective is smaller than its focal length, 
that the infrared imaging device includes a photon receiver with 
a long-wave sensitivity edge _l_[.sub]m[/] and a cooled mask 
preventing incidence of extraneous radiation on the 
photosensitive surfaces, and that the photosensitive element in 
each channel is followed by a photoelectron storage device 
ensuring optimal filtration for extraction of the signal from 
its mixture with white noise in the background radiation. The 
dependence of the thus defined noise equivalent temperature 
difference (NETD) on the long-wave sensitivity edge of the 
photon receiver is evaluated for an infrared imaging device with 
a single photosensitive element and with image scanning along 
both orthogonal axes, assuming that photoelectrons are stored 
within a time almost equal to the frame period. As the 
sensitivity edge shifts to longer waves, the specific NETD* 
first decreases very fast to a minimum (slightly above 
5x10[.sup]-8[/] k.cm.s[.sup]1/2[/] when the sensitivity 
edge is 28.2 m and the blackbody temperature is 292 K) and 
then almost negligibly increases. Fluctuations of the incident 
radiation flux and nonhomogeneity of the photosensitive surfaces 
tend to raise the minimum temperature difference detectable by 
infrared imaging. It is also shown that the information content 
of infrared images is smaller when the temperature of objects is 
lower. References 4.

  [Abstract] Studies made concerning protection of optical 
surfaces against detrimental biological agents, specifically 
defects caused by fungi, have revealed that conventional 
volatile fungicides and fungistats do inhibit mold formation on 
optical glasses, but also either form films of a less 
transparent condensates on the glass surface or corrode metal 
parts of the fixtures. A mixture of dimethyl diethoxysilane and 
antiseptic N- cyclohexyl dichloromaleate in acetone-alcohol 
solution was proposed in 1985, but later found to be inadequate 
and also to form a fine-polycrystalline layer rather than a 
desirable continuous condensate film when exposed to water vapor 
in the air. While new fungicidal thin coatings are being 
synthesized, a rational and comprehensive procedure for 
evaluating their effectiveness is being followed which includes 
measuring their fungicidal power, spectral characteristics of 
their optical properties, also their critical contact angle with 
water and thus their effect on the surface wettability in water. 
Included are further chemical analysis, mechanical tests, and 
environmental tests under conditions as severe as a humid 
subtropical climate. In this way have been and still are being 
developed bioactive organoelemental compounds for film-forming 
hydrophobic fungicidal coatings. They must not influence the 
performance characteristics of an optical device and not corrode 
its metal parts, they must remain stable during storage at room 
temperature, must be readily producible and not be a scarce 
commodity. They must also be ecologically harmless. A technology 
of producing them in a single process stage has been developed, 
high-molecular compounds being successfully used for surface 
modification of optical glasses. Addition of a film-forming 
YRSiX[.sub]3[/] monomer (Y- Hg,Sn, or substitute atom; R- 
alkyl group; X- hydrolyzable group) and mercury acetate or 
organostannosiloxane on top of a film-forming polymer of the 
polyorganosiloxane elastomer (synthetic caoutchoucs) group will 
ensure long lasting comprehensive protection, owing to 
cooperative action and effective hydrophobization. Enrichment 
caoutchouc with OH-groups prior to its deposition on glass will, 
moreover, strengthen its adhesion to the optical surface. Tables 
2; references 9.

  [Abstract] Based on the principles of aerial infrared 
imaging for explorative survey of natural resources by gapless 
scanning of the ground surface, the performance of an infrared 
imaging device carried by an aircraft and operating in the 
superposition of images mode is analyzed for its dependence on 
the aircraft pitching and heeling dynamics. An example of such 
an infrared imaging device is one which includes SPRITE 
radiation receivers operating with internal integration of 
signals, which ensures a very high detection power but normal 
operation within a very narrow range of scanning speeds only. 
The effectiveness of an infrared imaging device is defined as 
the angular space frequency _n_ of the equivalent thermal 
pattern to be resolved and thus as the reciprocal of its angular 
resolution, the latter being uniquely and monotonically related 
to the probability of detecting or recognizing objects on the 
ground. That angular space frequency can be determined from the 
temperature-frequency characteristic Q= 
_D_T[.sub]R[/]/_D_T[.sub]0[/]= _ps_(x) of the infrared 
imaging device (x= _ps_; _D_T[.sub]R[/]- effective 
difference between temperature of object and ambient 
temperature, taking into account the transmissivity of 
atmospheric air and deviation of the equivalent pattern from the 
standard one; _D_T[.sub]0[/]- temperature difference 
equivalent to the set noise). Another characteristic needed for 
evaluating the effectiveness of infrared imaging is the 
dependence of the threshold m of Q-magnification due to 
superposition of image rows or frames on the total relative 
shift between images. The scan cycle period is assumed to be 
usually much shorter than the periods of angular oscillations of 
an aircraft about any of its principal axes. It is also assumed 
that the photodetector noise may have a hyperbolic component.

  [Abstract] A new telescope has been developed for night 
observations at 3-5 mlx background illuminance without 
brightening. The objective of this NZT-3 telescope consists of 
seven successively smaller lenses on the main optical axis: 
convexo-plane first lens; double-convex second lens and 
double-concave third lens forming a compound pair; 
double-concave fourth lens; convexo-concave fifth lens and sixth 
lens; concavo-plane seventh lens. The objective is followed by 
an electron image converter tube on the same optical axis and 
the latter by an image erector consisting of four compound 
lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the main one: 
plano-concave lens and double-convex lens forming first pair; 
plano-convex lens and double-convex lens forming second pair; 
convexo-concave lens and double-convex lens forming third pair; 
double-convex lens and concavo-convex lens forming fourth pair. 
A rotating plane mirror mounted at a 45 angle to each of 
the two mutually perpendicular optical axes reflects light 
emerging from the image converter into the image erector. A 
second such mirror parallel to the first one reflects light 
emerging from the image erector into an ocular consisting of six 
lenses on a common optical axis perpendicular to the image 
erector axis and thus parallel to the main one: plano-concave 
first lens; double-concave second lens and double-convex third 
lens forming a compound pair; double-convex fourth lens and 
concavo-convex fifth lens forming a compound pair; convexo-plane 
sixth lens. The light source enclosed with the telescope is a 
type-A laser and a beam-forming objective consisting of three 
lenses of the same size: plane-convex first and third lenses; 
double-convex second lens touching first lens on the optical 
axis. The telescope characteristics include a magnification of 
at least 5.4, a field of vision angle of at least 5, and a 
focusing power within (+/-)4 diopters. The telescope has 
successfully passed all tests, including illumination 
measurements. It operates with an internal or external 13.5 V 
electric power supply and weighs 4.5 kg. Figures 3; tables 1;

  [Abstract] A method of designing an efficient heat 
extraction system for silicon cryomirrors under vacuum used in 
infrared astronomy is outlined, the major constraint being that 
such mirrors will to operate in a transient temperature field 
until the cooling from room temperature to a given low 
temperature below is completed with the temperature gradients on 
the mirror surface not exceeding permissible magnitudes and the 
thermal response of a the mirror to changes in heat and other 
loads not exceeding permissible limits. Conventional conductive 
cooling is ensured by solid contacts between mirror and heat 
extractor. The design procedure is based on a thorough 
experimental study on 53 mm long cylindrical mirrors 45 mm in 
diameter cut from blanks of cast polycrystalline silicon. Two 
radial holes 2 mm apart and as deep as the mirror radius were 
drilled one on the reflecting side and one on the dark side, for 
insertion of two Cu-constantan thermocouples. The reflecting 
surface was totally covered by a solid disk of grade-OOb copper 
under a heater coil with power regulation enabling it to act as 
an adjustable heat load simulator, large temperature differences 
across the interface thus also being attainable for measurement 
of its thermal resistance. Its thermal resistance was minimized 
by insertion of an indium foil between copper disk and silicon 
mirror, and by pressing onto the disk a copper plunger of 
special shape 15 mm in diameter at the contact. The plunger was 
wrapped in a sleeve of special thermal insulation and to its 
free other end was soldered-on a 150 mm long heat extracting 
conductor with a 4 mm large effective diameter. From the results 
of measurements has been determined the dependence of mirror 
temperatures, of temperature differences across critical contact 
zones, and of thermal resistances along the heat path on the 
length of cooling time. On the basis of these experimental data 
supplementing the appropriate mathematical model have been 
developed three versions of a Si-cryomirror cooling system: one 
with a single heat extracting conductor, one with four such 
conductors, and one with a copper hoop around the lateral mirror 
surface. Figures 6; tables 1; references 14.

  [Abstract] Following a review of basic Doppler radar 
principles applied to detection of moving objects and 
determination of their velocities by measurement of Doppler 
reflection spectra, a Doppler radar with an optical rangefinder 
is described which has been developed and built for monitoring 
motor vehicles which move through dust clouds. The light source 
is an LGN-901 CO[.sub]2[/]-laser with operating at a power 
level of about 3 W. Its radiation is stabilized by means of a 
piezoceramic corrector and a diffraction grating, whereupon a 
primary plane Cu mirror reflects it at a 90 angle onto a Ge 
plate for splitting into an object beam and a reference beam. 
The object beam is twice reflected upon 45 incidence on two 
successive plane mirrors, for passage along a parallel path 
through a diaphragm into a collimating lens which reduces its 
divergence to one eighth of the original. The collimated beam, 
40 mm in diameter with a 0.6 mrad divergence angle, is then 
reflected by a plane scanning mirror onto the road under 
observation, whereupon a part of the returning beam is reflected 
by the same scanning mirror into a receiving objective coaxial 
with the collimator and operating in the Cassagrain mode. The 
objective lens has a 1000 mm focal length and a 200 mm outside 
diameter, its 110 mm inside diameter being larger than that of 
the collimating lens. The objective focuses the incoming 
radiation on the diffraction spot on the 0.2x0.2 mm[.sup]2[/] 
large light-sensitive surface of a HgCdTe photodetector, a 
high-speed photodiode with a 30 MHz wide passband. The reference 
beam meanwhile passes through two successive acoustooptic 
modulators operating at close to one another frequencies (40 MHz 
and 39.6 MHz) and then, after reflection by another plane 
mirror, through the receiving objective to the photodiode. For 
automatic frequency control another photodetector, a 
photoresistor with 1x1 mm[.sup]2[/] large light-sensitive 
surface and a 1 MHz wide passband, is placed at the entrance to 
the laser. Such a configuration of the optical system enables 
the radar set to operate in the energy mode and in the 
heterodyne mode without additional tuning. Use of two modulators 
significantly weakens the effect of direct illumination at the 
carrier frequency in the reference channel. The radar is 
calibrated against a foam plastic panel set into 50 Hz vibration 
by a 10GD-30 loudspeaker head. Figures 2; references 2.

UDC 681.327.12.001] 
  [Abstract] A technical sighting system for prevention of 
railroad train collisions is being designed, a major role being 
assigned to semaphores. Its three basic tasks are to detect 
objects (obstacles), to identify them, and to decode their 
encoded position. A telephoto camera with an optoelectronic 
receiver of semaphore lights feeds images to a detector (image 
converter). The latter sends signals to: 1. an object identifier 
followed by a semaphore lights color analyzer, 2. a 
stereorangefinder, 3. a path analyzer. A generator of brake 
activation signals, upon receiving signals from these three 
sources, transmits an output signal to the brake servomechanism. 
The stereorangefinder and the tracking device are interfaced, 
the latter sending signals to a light source for the road. In 
the stereorangefinder a right prism with mirror faces is placed 
symmetrically between two terminal reflectors of incident light. 
This prism combines the light coming from both reflectors into a 
single beam and sends that beam through an intensity regulator 
into an objective followed successively by a focus magnifier and 
a beam splitter. Two hoods, one around each reflector, prevent 
entry of sunlight or the headlight beam of a train into the 
system. The spectral sensitivity band of the system is 0.45-0.90 
m, which covers both visible and near infrared light so that 
the system can respond to semaphore lights of all three colors: 
green (0.51-0.55 m) - yellow (0.57-0.59 m) - red 
(0.62-0.78 m) semaphore lights. Object-obstacle 
identification is based on geometrical characteristics. The 
color of a semaphore light is identified by spectral 
discrimination. The path analyzer has an autointerrogator with 
an exclusive-NOR gate, and a decoder followed successively by a 
comparator, a memory, and an autoresponder. Figures 4;

  [Abstract] A laboratory goniometer has been developed and 
built by the authors for studying the spatial reflection 
patterns of particularly three- dimensional objects but also of 
predominantly diffusely reflecting objects. Its optical system 
includes an illuminator with a 30 V - 300 W (stabilized) 
incandescent lamp and a photometer with a photomultiplier tube, 
the optical axes of their respective objectives intersecting at 
an angle _a_ at a point 0.6 m equidistant from both. The object 
is placed with its geometrical center at that point of 
intersection. Two sets of diaphragms are provided, one with 1-5 
mm diameters to be placed in the focal plane of the illuminator 
objective and with 3-12 mm diameters to be placed in the focal 
plane of the photometer objective. The object is placed with its 
geometrical center at that point of intersection. Two light 
absorbers, each in the form of a sheave with a set of 
black-coated 30 V-grooves, are placed 0.6 m behind the 
object: one diametrically opposite the illuminator aperture so 
as to completely cover the collimated light beam after its 
passage through the object and one diametrically opposite the 
photometer aperture so as to completely cover its field of view. 
The object is oriented and rotated by means of a device with 
DVSh80-06 stepper motors and three degrees of freedom. Two 
degrees of freedom are with respect to two orthogonal axes: 
rotation about one through any angle within the full 0  
_P_  360 range and about the other through any angle 
within the -88  _th_  +90 range. The third 
degree 
of freedom is added by rotation of the photometer axis about the 
illuminator axis through any angle within the the -22  
_ps_  180 range. Within the interference zone on the 
illuminator and photometer side the range of _P_ angles is 
narrower, depending on both _a_ and _ps_ angles. Goniometer 
control as well as signal recording and processing, including 
digital-to-analog conversion, are automated with the aid of a 
personal IBM PC-XT type computer which executes the operations 
according to a given program and displays the results on the 
screen of a SETU-10 multipurpose monitor. In this way was, for 
instance, tested a conical body. The dependence of its effective 
reflecting surface area on its orientation angle _P_ relative 
to 
the illuminator axis was measured with its position around the 
photometer axis at angle _th_= 0, the position of the 
photometer axis at around the illuminator axis at angle _ps_= 
90, and with three different angular distances between the 
two axes: _a_= 25, 90, 132. The main sources of 
possible errors are: nonuniform luminance distribution over the 
light beam cross-section and nonuniform sensitivity distribution 
over the photometer field of view, instability of both 
distributions, nonlinearity of photometer components, ambiguity 
of object position angles due to inaccurate initial setup and 
backlash in the drive mechanism. The relative mean-square error 
is, however, not likely to exceed 15 % (20 % in 
speckle 
photometry) and the object position angles can be measured 
accurately within 45' relative to both object and photometer 
rotation axes. Figures 3; references 5.

  [Abstract] Cryogenically cooled infrared devices with 
small pupil have excellent characteristics suitable for space 
research, especially a sensitivity higher than that of large 
optical terrestrial telescopes, but require low background noise 
levels. The essential requirements are: field of view ranging 
from tenths of angular minutes to several angular degrees, 
angular resolution ranging from fractions of a minute to tenths 
of minutes, spectral range from 2 m to beyond 100 m and 
thus beyond the window in the earth's atmosphere, diameter of 
lens or mirror ranging from 100 mm to 1000 mm, photosensitivity 
within the 10-0.1 aW/cm[.sup]2[/] range, number of objects 
detectable during one observation ranging from a hundred to a 
million, usability for an observation time ranging from tens of 
a minute to one year, and 10-90 width of Sun, Earth, Moon 
containing sectors. As far as photodetectors for such infrared 
telescopes are concerned, the design problems have already been 
thoroughly analyzed and completely solved. One of them is 
selection of semiconductor materials for the photoresistors 
which will ensure minimum generation-recombination noise at 
specific wavelengths of incident radiation: Ge:Hg for 13 m, 
Si:Ga for 16 m, Si:As or Ge:Cd for 22 m, Si:B for 30 
m. 
The topology of such low-noise photodetectors and the dimension 
of their ``elongated'' elements contribute to high accuracy of 
angle and radiation measurements. The optoelectronic devices for 
infrared telescopes must be cooled to various appropriate 
temperature levels within the 4-77 K range, so as to minimize 
the heat load at those levels. The cryogenic IKON infrared 
telescope for the ``IK-Obzor'' (IR Field of View) experiment 
operates with its objective at  30 K and its radiation 
receivers at  16 K. The objective, 150 mm in diameter, has 
a 5 
foot field of view and a 2 inch or 3 inch angular resolution. 
The telescope has 128 sensitive elements, all 150 m large, 
for operation within three respectively 7 m, 11 m, 14 
m 
wide spectral bands. The storage time is 0.1 and the mean-square 
error of angle measurements is 20 inches. One problem not yet 
solved is adequate protection against contaminants such as 
condensates of surrounding gases. Figures 2; tables 2; 
references 12.

Khimich, candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, chief

UDC 681.7.062:681.7.03] 
  [Abstract] Research done on optical mirrors made of 
nonconventional materials for telescopes and lasers is reviewed, 
the aim having been highest possible precision for optimizing 
the image quality and minimizing the beam divergence by limiting 
the diffraction. The scientific-technical research program 
included: 
  1. construction of physical and mathematical models for 
comprehensive design analysis; 
  2. development and evaluation of promising new materials; 
  3. theoretical and experimental study of internal sources of 
dimensional instability; 
  4. methods of forming diverse optical surfaces, including 
eccentric aspherical and higher-order aspherical ones, methods 
producing ultrasmooth surfaces, and methods of joining mirrors 
to support structures; 
  5. development and deposition of reflective and protective 
coatings; 
  6. means and methods of continuous inspection throughout the 
manufacturing and testing cycle. 
  The only way to maximize the thermal stability of mirrors 
made of conventional materials is to minimize their coefficient 
_a_ of linear thermal expansion. The three conventional new 
mirror materials ULE doped-fused quartz (developed in the 
U.S.A.), Cerodur (developed in Germany), and Sitall 
glass-ceramic (developed in Russia) are inadequate in this 
respect, because they remain stable only within narrow 
temperature ranges. Considering, however, that the thermal 
strain under quasi-steady (slowly varying) conditions is 
determined also by the thermal conductivity _l_ of the material 
(namely the _a_/_l_ ratio), metallic materials (beryllium, 
aluminum alloys, copper alloys) and nonmetallic ones (Si, SiC) 
have been added to the list, especially since their critical 
mechanical properties are either superior (modulus of elasticity 
E) or comparable (E/k ratio, k- stiffness coefficient). Also 
composite materials are considered, mirrors made of the SiC-Si 
composite material combining light weight with high stiffness. A 
new technology has been developed for manufacturing mirrors with 
a structural-grade glass coating on a metal substrate, the 
expansion coefficients of the two materials necessarily 
matching. The technology ensures that the glass coating is 
sufficiently hard and chemically stable, that its softening 
temperature is sufficiently high and no crystallization occurs, 
and that the adhesion of glass to metal is sufficiently strong. 
The technology includes deposition of 3-5 mm thick glass plates 
on the metal surface, followed by a heating-soaking-cooling 
process according to a specific temperature-time cycle. Such 
mirrors up to 1200 mm in diameter have already been built and 
withstood temperatures down to -60C without fracture of the 
coating. Special polishing and diamond grinding processes have 
been developed which reduces the roughness of metal surfaces to 
within 2-3 nm and 4-5 nm respectively, as measured with a 
contact profilometer or on the basis of integral light 
scattering. Also other reflective and protective coatings have 
also been developed: a multilayer dielectric on metal mirrors 
for 0.308 m or 1.064 m radiation, and metal-dielectric 
ones on mirrors for 5.1 m or 10.6 m radiation. Another 
aim 
is reducing the weight of large mirrors, the first generation of 
light-weight mirrors with glass on beryllium up to 1200 mm in 
diameter having been built in 1985. These mirrors have an 
asphericity not exceeding 180 m and a mean-square form 
deviation in 0.63 m light not exceeding 0.02 (plane and 
sphere) and 0.1 (higher- order asphericity). Their relative 
aperture is 1:5 and their reflection coefficient is 0.92 for 
visible light, 0.96 for near-infrared light, 0.93 for 
far-infrared light. For cryogenic telescopes used in astronomy 
are considered highly isotropic and technological low-cost 
mirrors made of aluminum alloys with protective coatings which 
can be cleaned by conventional methods. For optical cavities of 
technological lasers are being developed mirrors up to 1000 mm 
in diameter with reflective and protective coatings on 
ultrasmooth surfaces, suitable for both continuous-wave and 
pulse-repetition modes of operation at power levels up to 200 
kW, multilayer compound mirrors with cooling as well as 
monolithic mirrors without cooling. Tables 3; references 2.

  [Abstract] Power lasers with widely variable 
characteristics have been built to serve as high-energy 
hyperdirectional radiation sources, as sources of luminous 
energy to be transmitted over long distances with minimum loss 
and to be received with subdiffractional precision. One of the 
largest research stands built at the Institute of Optics during 
the past 15 years is the 6-channel ``Progress,'' intended for 
the study of intense radiation and spherical target interaction 
relating to laser-induced thermonuclear fusion. It includes a 
Nd-glass master laser emitting pulses of up to 1.5 kJ energy and 
about 1 ns duration or a power of 3.5 TW in pulses of 0.1 ns 
duration. It also includes a chirp-pulse generator with a 
regenerative amplifier and a shaping-pulse generator, both 
feeding a common preamplifier with two inputs and three outputs. 
Pulses from one output pass through a compressor to the target 
inside a spherical chamber. Pulses from the other two outputs 
pass through a separator to a module which contains: a series of 
bar and disk amplifiers with successively larger (30 mm to 110 
mm) apertures with vacuum-type spatial filters separating the 
amplifiers and preventing self-action, electrooptical 
deflectors, electrooptical (Pockels) shutters and magnetooptical 
(Faraday) shutters decoupling the laser from targets, and 
harmonic filters. From here pulses proceed along six channels to 
six targets. Some pulses are deflected through an amplifier with 
a 140 mm aperture to two detectors with 150 mm and 250 mm 
apertures respectively. Some pulses are diverted to another 
compressor. This stand was used in experiments with pulse 
compression during stimulated Mandelshtam-Brillouin scattering. 
For generating and amplifying ultrashort chirp pulses of only 1 
mJ energy and 0.2-1.0 ns within a 2-4 nm spectral, a very 
inefficient Nd-glass laser is replaced with a mode-locked 
YAG:Nd[.sup]+3[/] laser emitting continuous sequences of 
pulses of 50 ps duration at a repetition rate of 100 MHz within 
a 0.2 nm wide spectral band. Chirp pulses of 0.15-0.6 ns 
duration are formed in single-mode fiber optics, where phase 
modulation and group velocity dispersion broaden the spectrum 
and elongate a pulse. Additional elongation of a pulse takes 
place in a lattice-type stretcher. Extraction of a pulse is 
effected by the electrooptical shutters, which are controlled by 
photoelectric switches. The regenerative amplifier then puts out 
a pulse of about 1 mJ energy, sufficient for transmission to the 
main amplifier channel with a 110 mm exit aperture. A second 
large research stand is the ``LAS'', which includes an Nd-glass 
laser with phase conjugation and a 110 mm output aperture. It 
emits pulses of up to 500 J and 25 ns duration in a beam with a 
divergence angle of 5 rad so that the axial radiation 
intensity reaches 80 aW/cm[.sup]2[/]. A third large research 
stand is the ``Chibis'', which includes a CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
operation in the pulse-repetition mode. Experiments with this 
apparatus have demonstrated the feasibility of a 
focusing-deflecting system which uses large compound mirrors and 
of compensating its aberrations by means of phase conjugation.

  [Abstract] The ultrasensitive laser atomic fluorescence 
spectroscopy (LAFS) method was used in direct determination of 
the content of Pb, Cd and Bi in samples of deep layers of ice 
from Antarctica and Greenland. The work was done in 
collaboration with French scientists from the LGGE at Grenoble. 
The LAFAS-1 spectrometer, in which the source of resonance 
radiation is a dye laser excited by the radiation of an excimer 
XeCl laser, was used. The spectrometer is fully described in the 
literature and briefly in this article. The sampling method and 
method for preparing the samples are described in detail. Ice 
cylinders 6-10 cm in diameter and 15-30 cm high were extracted. 
There was excellent agreement between the results of Pb and Cd 
measurements made by the LAFS method and the two classical 
methods. However, the sensitivity of the LAFS method is several 
orders of magnitude greater than the other methods. With the 
LAFAS-1 all three elements were measured with sample volumes 
20m (Pb) and 50 m (Cd, Bi). In the traditional method a 
much longer time was required in the sampling and the samples 
had to be much larger. There are three principal sources of 
entry of heavy metals into the atmosphere: wind erosion of the 
soil surface, volcanic ejecta and microspray from the ocean 
surface. The contribution of different sources is examined in 
detail in the example of Pb. Figures 2; references 21: 20

  [Abstract] Formulas are derived for computing the 
probability of detecting thermal anomalies arising when there is 
leakage from gas and oil pipelines. At least 100 such accidents 
occur in Russia annually and the number is expected to increase. 
The key parameters of the thermal anomalies (_D_T[.sub]R[/], 
S) arising with escape of the product from a pipeline and 
ambient inhomogeneities (_D_T[.sub]back[/]) were studied in 
key sectors of the Ural-Siberian gas pipeline during summer, 
autumn and winter under different meteorological conditions 
(clear, cloudy, rain, snow) with simulation of leakage of the 
product into the atmosphere, in the ground at different depths, 
into snow and into the ground beneath snow. Observations were 
made at altitudes 0.05...0.2 km in the spectral range 8-14 m 
with registry by a specially developed helicopter-borne thermal 
imager, whose principal technical specifications were optimized, 
outfitted with a device for measuring the difference 
_D_T[.sub]R[/]. The behavior of these parameters as a 
function of many other variables (including helicopter speed and 
altitude) was ascertained. For example, the maximum level of 
background radiation temperature fluctuations 
_D_T[.sub]back[/] is dependent on season and prevailing 
meteorological conditions: 3 K (summer, daytime, clear), 1 K 
(summer, daytime, cloudy), 2 K (winter, daytime, clear), 0.5 K 
(winter, daytime, cloudy). Such measurements are illustrated in 
the example of several thermal anomalies arising during real 
leaks into snow-covered ground. Figure 1; references 2: 1

  [Abstract] In developing thermonuclear targets with a 
positive energy yield it is customary to examine a case when the 
deuterium and tritium are present in the target in a condensed 
state. Such targets are used in laser thermonuclear fusion 
experiments at the Iskra-4 and Iskra-5 facilities. The material 
used for the coatings is liquid and solid deuterium or a 
deuterium-tritium mixture, as well as beryllium and titanium 
hydrides and polyethylene containing deuterium and tritium. An 
annotated diagram of the cryogenic unit for preparing a target 
in the interaction chamber is given. The technology for 
preparing cryogenic targets and their installation in the 
interaction chamber is fully explained in the text. This 
technology is similar to that developed in the United States 
(such as D. L. Musinski, et al., APPL. PHYS. LETTS, 34, 300, 
1979). The method makes it possible to obtain a cryogenic target 
100-300 m in diameter and 0.5-2 m thick. Details of the 
method are given. For example, the behavior of the cryolayer was 
registered by a motion picture survey of the shadow pattern or 
interferogram; holographic interferometry was used for more 
precise measurements of the thickness and uniformity of the 
cryolayer. Additional information is given on the procedures for 
controlling and monitoring the parameters and behavior of the 
layer. Figures 7; references 15: 13 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Computer tomography problems place high demands 
on computing equipment. Regularization methods must be used; 
consequently, matrix algorithms must first be developed. 
Cellular methods may be advantageously used to solve large 
linear algebra problems on parallel computers by recursively 
decomposing the matrix problem and taking advantage of computer 
features. This paper studies the applicability of cellular 
methods in two-dimensional linear computer tomography. The image 
is represented by a square symmetric matrix of order 
n, which determines the resolution. A 
cellular-triangular SIMD computer with numerous processor 
modules with a small amount of local memory and a moderate 
amount of common memory may be used to solve the problem. The 
entire system can be controlled with a single program in special 
computer memory. Another way of solving the problem is to invoke 
control from a host machine, typically a PC. The first solution 
is suitable for tomography, the second for design work.

  [Abstract] Pulse-code modulated and delta-modulated signals 
are used to represent speech signals. The Fourier spectra of 
pulse-code modulated signals were analyzed; Hartley spectra were 
also considered. The spectra were divided into frequency ranges, 
or spectral coefficients. Three spectra types were isolated: 
those with almost all energy at low frequencies, mixed spectra, 
and those with most energy in the high-frequency range. The 
number of coefficients which can be transmitted in one frame is 
determined. Methods of decreasing the initial number of 
coefficients are described. A graph of the signal compression 
algorithm is presented. An algorithm is developed to compress a 
delta-modulated speech signal: an Adamar-ordering algorithm is 
used to represent a delta-modulated signal in the form of 
coefficients expanded into a system of orthogonal Walsh 
functions. The minimum number of spectral coefficients is 
determined for which analog signal quality is not worsened. 
Vector quantization and orthogonal Fourier, Hartley, and Walsh 
transforms were found to be effective in compressing 
pulse-code-modulated and delta-modulated speech signals. The 
algorithm used to determine the optimal code size is described, 
and the results are discussed. Optimal transmission speeds are 
found to be 2.3-2.5 kb/s for delta modulation and 4.6-4.8 kb/s 
for pulse-code modulation. Figures 4; references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Automated terrain analysis requires reliable 
detailed information on the spatial position and relative 
heights of objects in digital form. Currently, this is done with 
photogrammetric processing of stereoscopic large-scale aerial 
photographs. This, however, is slow. A computer method of 
creating digital terrain models has been developed which uses 
individual large-scale space and aerial photographs, digital 
topographical maps, or large-scale topographical maps. The 
system uses an IBM-AT PC with a half-tone scanner. 
Single-exposure, panoramic, and infrared aerospace images may be 
used. The article examines the following steps in the process: 
preparatory work; photo scanning with a half-tone scanner; 
formation of a digital relief matrix; acquisition of the 
coordinates of reference points in the coordinate systems of the 
photo and the terrain; photographic resection; photo digitizing; 
photographic intersection; determination of the relative heights 
of objects; and formation of the digital terrain model. The 
resultant models are highly accurate, detailed, and reliable.

  [Abstract] Random vibrations in technical systems may 
provide information on an object or its internal 
characteristics. Estimates of the dimensions of attractors and 
fractal properties of chaotic time series of observations may be 
used to identify motion in dynamic systems, and may diagnose 
changes in their states. Separation of true chaos from system 
noise is discussed. Examples from the field of oil and gas 
extraction are presented which illustrate the possibility of 
using these charateristics to monitor and control technological 
proesses using data obtained in the course of normal operations. 
It is shown that this information may be used to increase 
operational efficiency and extend the lifetime of equipment.

  [Abstract] This paper examines rather complex statistical 
objects, random processes characterized by their own probability 
distributions. The objects are formalized using the concept of a 
statistical class, which is introduced in this article. The main 
vehicle for describing statistical classes is level sets. These 
sets are defined by set-theoretical operations on statistical 
classes, in particular, measures of mutual inclusion and 
equality of arbitrary classes. Many properties of level sets are 
studied in the first part of the article. It is shown that a 
group of these sets can be used to define a statistical class. 
Operations on statistical classes are a natural extension of 
operations on level sets. The link between level sets and the 
traditional axiomatic theory of fuzzy sets is described. The set 
of minimal events, described in this paper, leads to the 
representation of a statistical class in the form of a fuzzy 
set. The link between fuzzy sets and probability distributions 
is established. The measures of inclusion and equality used for 
statistical classes can be transferred to arbitrary fuzzy sets, 
and more importantly, to fuzzy intervals and numbers. However, 
not every fuzzy set corresponds to a statistical class, and this 
is an issue that must still be addressed. References 6: 4

  [Abstract] Cellular automata are discrete mathematical 
models of multi-component natural and artificial systems 
consisting of a large number of relatively simple elements 
linked locally into regular structures. Cellular automata may be 
applied to parallel asynchronous computation or image 
processing. This article examines an algorithm to model 
multi-dimensional deterministic finite asynchronous cellular 
automata with memory in a Turing machine with one-dimensional 
tapes (Turing machines without memory are also considered). 
Turing machines are claasical devices for evaluating the 
complexity of calculations. Estimates are obtained for the 
spatial and temporal complexity of modeling. It is found that 
the number of cell states, the size of the vicinity around a 
cell used to determine its state, the amount of memory, and the 
maximum delay as a cell changes from one state to another are 
either constant or vary insignificantly as the number of cells 
increases. Formulas are presented which are useful in evaluating 
the complexity of modeling asynchronous cellular automata with 
memory. Examples of the modeling of multi-component systems are 
presented. The case of a network of cellular automata is 
considered. Figures 8; references 16: 8 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] This article examines and analyzes a closed 
exponential network of queues of large dimension with several 
classes of calls. This network, which includes finite sources of 
calls of every class and a set of one-channel devices, is a 
generalized model of inhomogeneous multiprocessor systems with a 
completely connected interface, as well as a generalized model 
of multiterminal systems with external memory. The Laplace 
method is used to prove a system of assertions which define and 
validate asymptotic approximations for basic stationary 
characteristics of the model for a rather broad set of cases of 
load distributions among the servicing devices in the network. 
This is in contrast to previous papers where asymptotic 
approximations with a predetermined accuracy were obtained only 
for cases of a single class of calls or a small load on all 
(finite) one-channel devices. The simple form of the 
approximations makes it possible to guarantee accuracy and 
quickly obtain a solution to the problem of evaluating the 
performance of multiprocessor and multi-terminal systems. Figure

  [Abstract] This paper gives a general overview of the use 
of computers in the design of multi-component systems. The 
article begins by describing the concept of computerized 
teleconferencing, where all participants see the same thing on 
their screens and can act on it while communicating in real 
time. It is noted that collaborations of researchers are no 
longer limited by geography, and that international 
collaborations are becoming more and more common. The problem of 
evaluating the complexity of a task is discussed. Breaking down 
a project into parts which can be worked on by different teams 
speeds the design process, as does the use of expert systems. 
Limits on the number of designers and workstations require 
coordination of resources and efforts. A flow chart shows how 
work can be organized. The process of limiting the number of 
variants to examine and selecting the best variant is described 
mathematically. Integration of components and selection of 
optimal designs from the point of view of integrating them with 
other components are addressed. Basic concepts involved in the 
design and construction of a network for designers are outlined, 
as well as the connection of separate networks with gateways or 
by uniting them into one network. Multitasking and servers are 
described. Figures 5; tables 4; references 6: 4 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] In chemical and gas dynamic lasers, phase 
aberrations form in the resonator cavity on density 
inhomogeneities in the medium. These inhomogeneities occur in 
the stream beyond a specific nozzle. The degree of curvature of 
the two-dimensional edge as radiation passes through the medium 
determines optical quality. This paper studies the optical 
quality of the stream beyond flat nozzles typically used in gas 
dynamic lasers and cellular nozzles used in chemical and gas 
dynamic lasers. Phase distortions occur in both regular and 
turbulent structures. The stream in the resonator cavity was 
sampled with a small diameter beam. The focal point method was 
used to study the effect of stream features beyond flat and 
cellular nozzles on the optical quality of the medium. Light 
scattering occurs in turbulent wakes. Phase changes in the light 
beam are due to the structure and size of the wakes. Flat 
nozzles provide no advantage over cellular nozzles for 
resonators with a stream of around 80 m or greater. Figures 6; 
references 20: 6 Russian, 14 Western.

  [Abstract] This paper experimentally studies the effect of 
the design parameters of the injector nozzle of a combustion 
chamber on the stability of the combustion process with regard 
to relatively transverse gas vibrations within the chamber. 
Independent parameters studied individually are: length, 
diameter, and shape of gas lines, and the transmission rate of 
the injector nozzle when other design and operating parameters 
remain unchanged. The transmission rate of the nozzle is the 
ratio of the total area of the gas lines in the nozzle to the 
cross sectional area of the cylindrical part of the chamber. The 
nozzles tested here have ratios of 0.134 and 0.255. Different 
gas line lengths lead to a significant change in the flow rate 
at which vibrations occur. The minimum flow rate at the lower 
edge of the vibration region for both nozzles was virtually the 
same, given identical line lengths. There are two distinct 
stability minima in the studied ranges of line length, 48-62 and 
156-169 mm. The next minimum is at 250 mm. Maxima are clearly 
visible at 6-12, 100-120, and 210 mm. The stability of 
combustion is calculated as a function the Mach number and the 
ratio of the length of gas lines l to the wavelength of sound in 
the lines, _l_. At the best stability value, minima and maxima 
are separated by about 0.5l/_l_. At the worst stability value, 
they are separated by 0.25l/_l_. This is a key finding of his 
paper and indicates the acoustic nature of the effect of gas 
line length. Converging lines have advantages over cylindrical 
ones. Resonance properties of the nozzle lines are key in 
determining optimal length. The interaction of longitudinal gas 
vibrations in the gas lines and transverse (tangential) gas 
vibrations in the combustion chamber is studied. Figures 8; 
references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] One method of keeping up the pace of road 
construction in regions without stone deposits and with sparse 
transport and production facilities is the use of thermally 
fortified soil in the earthen road bed and top dressing. The 
local soil is pregranulated and dried in reactors equipped with 
electric arc plasmotrons. Optimal granule size must be 
determined, as well as the thermal processing parameters. 
High-temperature processing of granules in gas streams generated 
by electric arc plasmotrons involves complex radiative and 
convective heat exchange. This paper attempts to consider 
radiative and convective heat exchange in the heating of 
spherical soil particles in a stream of low-temperature plasma. 
The temperature distribution over the radius of the spherical 
particle is determined from the beginning of thermal processing. 
The temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the 
soil was determined experimentally in the 20-1200C range 
and can be tracked for a specific initial temperature of the 
sphere and gas medium temperature. It was found that for a wide 
range of radii the movement of the thermal pulse from the 
surface to the center of the particles occurs at an 
approximately uniform speed. Radiative heat exchange plays a 
significant role in radiative-convective heating of the 
particles. Other aspects of thermal processing are examined. 
Further research is needed to determine optimal parameters.

  [Abstract] This paper proposes a model describing the 
deformation and destruction of heat-releasing elements due to a 
pulsed energy release which arises in an uncontrolled release of 
positive reactivity into a reactor. The pulse is less than one 
second long. It is assumed that the jacket is destroyed by 
high-speed deformation due to internal pressure. In addition to 
pressure due to heating and evaporation of water, this paper 
also considers thermal expansion, fusion of fuel, and the 
presence of gas in the gap and within the fuel. A single 
approach is used to describe the dynamics of heat-releasing 
element behavior (in particular, the increase in internal 
pressure) and the threshold value of destruction in relation to 
energy release pulse parameters and the initial state of the 
heat-releasing element. Model figures agree with theoretical 
values for pressure amplitude and the onset of heat-releasing 
element destruction. As the proportion of gas increases, the 
threshold of destruction increases. The threshold power of the 
burst decreases as pulse length increases. Figures 4; table 1; 
references 9: 3 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] A modified model of a MIS transistor is 
developed which, in contrast to standard models, provides a 
continuous description of the volt-ampere characteristic, 
providing a more accurate model of analog circuits operating in 
pre-threshold mode. The slope and displacement of model 
pre-threshold characteristics is determined by induced charges 
which reflect physical processes in the irradiated structure. A 
new method of determining threshold voltages and current from 
measured volt-ampere characteristics is proposed. Compared to 
the method which determines threshold voltage at a constant 
current, this method more accurately describes the volt-ampere 
characteristic of irradiated transistors in weak inversion mode. 
The standard model of a bipolar transistor is supplemented with 
recombination components of the base current that arise in 
various areas of the structure. Each recombination component is 
unambiguously physically linked with the electrophysical 
parameters of the semiconductor structure, the geometric 
dimensions, and the radiation dose. Consequently, the new model 
can rather easily evaluate various design variants of transistor 
structures from the point of view of radiation resistance. 
Software has been developed to determine model parameters and 
radiation coefficients for this model. Figures 8; references 24: 
4 Russian, 20 Western.

  [Abstract] The threshold voltage of the onset of negative 
differential conductivity is studied in a thin film n-GaAs 
structure with a Schottky barrier and with a semi-insulated 
compensated substrate. When the Schottky barrier depletion 
region is adjacent to the film-substrate junction depletion 
region, as cut-off voltage increases at the barrier there is not 
the usual decrease in the threshold voltage of the onset of 
negative differential conductivity, but an increase. This is 
because the voltage at the gate increases with the ratio of the 
longitudinal field at the drain end of the gate to the 
longitudinal field at the source end (the distribution of the 
longitudinal field becomes more homogeneous). Figures 2; 
references 4 (Russian).

  [Abstract] This article presents a study of the 
electrophysical properties of silicon MIS structures with 
dielectric films of disprosium and lutetium oxides manufactured 
with high-temperature (1323-1593 K) oxidation of rare-earth 
metal films. Rare-earth metal oxide films have a specific 
resistance on the order of 10[.sup]17[/] _O_ cm, a large 
specific capacitance (3X10[.sup]4[/]-3.6X10[.sup]4[/] 
pF/cm[.sup]2[/]), small dielectric loss tangents 
(0.4X10[.sup]-3[/]-5X10[.sup]-3[/]) and a high electric 
strength (2X10[.sup]6[/]-4X10[.sup]6[/] V/cm). The 
volt-capacitance characteristics method shows that the MIS 
structures, compared to thermal silicon dioxide structures, have 
a substantially lower built-in fixed charge in the dielectric, 
and have a large breakdown voltage. The dependence of depth of 
bedding of the p-n junction on diffusion time of disprosium into 
silicon is determined at various diffusion temperatures. The 
depth of bedding increases nonlinearly as the time and 
temperature of diffusion increases, and this figure varies from 
0.5 to 2.5 m. Diffusion coefficients are determined for 
disprosium and lutetium atoms in single crystal silicon. 
Diffusion coefficients increase from 3X10[.sup]-13[/] to 
10[.sup]-11[/] and from 10[.sup]-12[/] to 
4.2X10[.sup]-12[/] cm[.sup]2[/]/s as temperature increases 
from 1373 to 1593K for disprosium and lutetium respectively. MIS 
structures with rare-earth metal oxide films have a positive 
fixed charge in the dielectric which is a factor of 4-7 lower 
than in thermal silicon dioxide structures. Figures 4; tables 2; 
references 5: 4 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Previous papers have outlined the basic physical 
phenomena behind electroluminescent structures and the processes 
which occur in the luminophore and dielectric layers. However, 
no electric model of electron processes in the 
electroluminescent structure of thin film capacitors has been 
developed. A thin film electroluminescent capacitor consists of 
a transparent electrode, dielectric, luminophore, dielectric, 
and opaque electrode on a glass substrate. The electric 
properties of the luminophore layer are nonlinear. In the 
equivalent circuit this is modeled with a capacitor with a 
capacitance equal to the geometric capacitance of the 
luminophore layer connected in parallel to a nonlinear 
resistance. The dielectric layer is modeled with capacitors 
whose capacitances are geometric capacitances of the dielectric 
film connected in parallel with variable resistors. A full 
schematic is given in a figure. The real thin film 
electroluminescent capacitor and the model were compared. It was 
found during testing that volt-charge characteristics could be 
used for quality control. The time dependence of current was 
determined for a sinusoidal and linearly alternating voltage. 
The model provides an adequate representation of electron 
processes in thin film electroluminescent structures.. The model 
may be modified to represent more complex effects. Figures 3; 
references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Both spectral and correlation characteristics of 
nonlinearly frequency-modulated pulse signals are 
comprehensively examined, nonlinear rather than linear frequency 
modulation being necessary for perfect shaping of compressed 
signals. For specificity are considered a pulse signal u(t)= Re 
[U(t)exp(j_o_[.sub]0[/]t)] and power-law frequency modulation 
_o_(t)= 
_o_[.sub]d[/](2|t|/_t_[.sub][/])[.sup]p[/]sign(t): t- 
time, |t|  _t_[.sub]i[/]/2, _o_(0)- carrier frequency, 
_t_[.sub]i[/]- pulse duration, U(t)= 
U[.sub]0[/]exp(j_ps_t)- complex envelope with amplitude 
U[.sub]0[/] and phase _ps_(t), _o_[.sub]d[/]- frequency 
deviation, p- power exponent, sign(t)- sign function. Analytical 
expressions are derived for the spectral density S(_o_) and 
the 
correlation function R(_t_) of such signals. The continuous 
phase _ps_(t) in the expression for the spectral density is 
approximated is approximated with a piecewise-constant function 
coinciding at discrete time intervals _D_t= |g[.sub]i[/]/2N 
and the phase difference _ps_(t)- _ps_(t- _t_) in the 
expression 
for the correlation function is made approximately equal to 
_t__o_(t). For a numerical analysis, S(_o_) and R(_t_) 
are 
normalized to S(0) and R(0) respectively. Calculation for p &lt; 
1 
and for p &gt;  1 including p= 1 confirm that within the _o_ 
 
|g[.sub]d[/] frequency range the signal spectrum is almost 
uniform when p= 1 (linear frequency modulation) and nonuniform 
when p &lt; 1 or p &gt;  1, with the maximum spectral density S at 
frequencies near _o_[.sub]d[/] when p &lt; 1 and near _o_= 0 
when p &gt;  1. The farther p is from 1, moreover, the higher and 
narrower is the S(_o_)/S(0) peak. Figures 5.

  [Abstract] A quasi-optimum but fast algorithm is proposed 
for digital radar aperture synthesis: subdivision of the 
reference function _O_ into M not overlapping time intervals 
(subapertures) with K readings in each and simplified data 
processing in each. For specificity is considered formation of a 
continuous radar image by the method of subframes, namely from 
(1  _D_N  N) readings taken along the signal path 
with 
partial change of information in the memory of the aperture 
processor after every image forming stroke. For usually small 
subapertures K and subframes _D_N the the two steps of the 
algorithm are: 
1) formation of M subaperture sums, after phase correction of 
each input reading; 
2) formation of _D_N output readings from the M subaperture 
sums, after additional phase correction and then another 
summation. The main advantage of this algorithm over the basic 
one is that the same and only the same M subaperture sums are 
used for formation of the _D_N output readings, inasmuch as the 
weight function included in the reference function remains 
constant within a subframe. Consequently, in the case of _D_N = 
K formation of each new reading for the output image requires 
only 2M complex multiplications and additions and thus K/2 times 
fewer than are required for conventional convolution. The 
algorithm will be still faster when a fast Fourier 
transformation is performed during execution of the second step. 
An analysis of the radiation pattern of an antenna with a thus 
synthesized aperture indicates that both the width of the major 
lobe and the height of the first minor lobe are determined 
principally by the radiation pattern of the array multiplier, 
which corresponds to a focused antenna of the same dimensions. 
The radiation pattern of a subaperture remains constant within a 
subframe and changes by jumps from one subframe to another.

  [Abstract] Complex discharge modes of hollow multimode 
waveguides with a multilayer case are studied with a rigorous 
electrodynamic method based on joining of field segments and the 
resultant dispersion equation in a complex plane. The waveguide 
case is composed of magnetodielectric materials with losses. By 
varying the thicknesses and permeabilities of the layers and 
their depth in the case, one can achieve a significant broadband 
improvement in mode selection at high frequencies. One can also 
achieve this by reducing losses in the main mode at low 
frequencies. The figures show run losses of the first few fast 
modes of a cylindrical multimode dielectric waveguide with a 
hollow channel for various configurations of complex 
permittivities and permeabilities and different numbers of 
layers. The effect of resonant and nonresonant materials on 
self-filtering are explained. Figures 6; table 1; references 19:

  [Abstract] This paper presents observations of the 
development of storm activity in the European region of Russia 
using single-point passive thunderstorm radar. The device has an 
electric collapsible whip antenna and a magnetic loop antenna, 
amplifiers, digital recorders for atmospheric phenomena, a small 
computer, a CAMAC crate, color display, and printer. The range 
is 300-2000 km. RMS range error is 7-10%, angular error 
up to 
2. Phenomena are received in the 5-20 kHz range. Readings 
are taken 1-3 times per minite. Examples of the recording of 
sources of thunderstorm discharges are presented on a map of the 
territory under investigation. Activity can be tracked 
simultaneously over the entire European region of Russia. The 
results agree with meteorological data obtained at the same 
time. The studies experimentally demonstrated the ability to 
evaluate the current thunderstorm situation and the dynamics of 
storm development in a territory with a radius of up to 2000 km.

  [Abstract] This paper studies the reverse problem of 
diffraction for local inhomogeneities rigidly attached to the 
surface of an object. The method of constructing a 
two-dimensional radar image is analyzed. The method is based on 
application of the synthesized aperture method to the 
development of a packet of broadband signals when one only knows 
the intensity of the reflected signal. The quality of the 
resultant image is studied. The limits imposed on the parameters 
of the discrete signal (to avoid an ambiguous measurement) are 
formulated. Modeling results are presented. Coherent 
one-dimensional and two-dimensional portraits are contrasted. 
Two-dimensional images are found to have a better resolution. 
Noncoherent images are poorer than coherent ones, as noncoherent 
images are plagued with false peaks and a decreased signal to 
noise ratio. Figures 6; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Materials now being developed will make it 
possible to improve the weight efficiency of aircraft and 
helicopters being built for use in 1995-2010 by 15-20 percent 
and extend their life by a factor of 1.5. High-strength aluminum 
alloys of the system Al-Zn-Mg-Cu and medium-strength alloys of 
the system Al-Cu-Mg are now being developed that will make it 
possible to produce molded components with strengths up to 
540-600 MPa and forged components with strengths up to 450-550 
MPa. One area receiving particular attention is that of 
developing lithium-alloyed aluminum alloys (the alloys 1441 and 
1430) with a reduced density (2.58 g/cm[.sup]3[/]), increased 
elasticity modulus, and a 10-20 percent longer life. The 
weldable structural alloy 1151 is much more heat and corrosion 
resistant than its foreign counterpart 2219 and is even superior 
to many nonweldable structural alloys. The process for producing 
casting aluminum alloys is also being improved. The 
high-strength alloys VAL12 and VAL14 are stronger than their 
foreign counterparts and do not contain silver, and their 
strength should reach 600 MPa by the end of the century. The 
high-temperature alloys ATsR1U and VAL18 may be used at 
temperatures up to 540, and corrosion-resistant and 
impermeable alloys with respective strengths of 420 and 480 MPa 
should be available by the year 2000. New strong casting and 
wrought magnesium alloys have made it possible to dramatically 
reduce the weight of aviation-related products. Work is under 
way to create magnesium-based composite alloys reinforced with 
B, C, and SiC fibers. The Mg-B composite has a density of 2.44 
g/cm[.sup]3[/], strength of 1,500 MPa, elasticity modulus of 
260 GPa, and ultimate strength of 61.5 km, which makes it 
significantly stronger than high-strength aluminum, magnesium, 
and titanium alloys. In the future, these materials will have a 
strength of 2,000 MPa, elasticity modulus of 300 GPa, and 
working temperature of 400. The main goals of research in 
the area of titanium alloys are to increase specific strength 
and heat resistance, increase reliability and life, and expand 
the temperature range in which such alloys may be used. VT36 is 
among the most promising developments in the area of titanium 
alloys. When compared with VT18U, it is 15 percent more heat 
resistant at 600C. The alloy VT8M, which is alloyed with 
tin and zirconium, is more crack resistant than VT9. The alloy 
VT35 has an ultimate strength of 1,150 to 1,200 MPa. Another new 
direction is that of creating high-strength and high-temperature 
structural titanium alloys on the basis of a triphase structure 
involving _a_- and _b_-solutions and intermetallide 
dispersion 
strengthening. Titanium alloys of this type make it possible to 
increase their operating temperature from 300-350 to 
450-500C and ultimate strength to 1,400 MPa. A great deal 
of attention is being paid to developing fundamentally new 
alloys based on titanium aluminides (Ti[.sub]3[/]Al and TiAl) 
that, at a density of 3.8 g/cm[.sup]3[/], make it possible to 
increase the working temperature to 750-800C and elasticity 
modulus practically to the level of steel (170 GPa). Research is 
also under way to use the method of granular metallurgy to 
produce a new class of steel-steel composites that, by the year 
2005, should boast an ultimate strength of 2,500 MPa and a five- 
to tenfold increase in fracture toughness. The general trend in 
modern aviation instrument making has demanded the development 
of increasingly miniaturized permanent magnets with complex 
configuration, and materials based on intermetallic compounds of 
rare earth elements and transition metals have been developed 
for such purposes. High-temperature nickel alloys appear to be 
the most promising material for turbine disks and the final 
stages of gas turbine engine compressors in the next decade. 
Principles of producing a controlled microstructure in stampings 
of disks providing the required set of service properties for 
new materials have been developed and implemented. A new class 
of disk materials based on nickel intermetallides is being 
developed that should become the primary material for gas 
turbine engine disks in the 21st century and that can be used at 
temperatures up to 950C. The single-crystal alloys ZhS32, 
ZhS36, and ZhS40 are also promising. Another important problem 
of aviation engineering is that of protecting the surface of 
turbine blades from high-temperature oxidation. New 
high-temperature multicomponent protective coatings have been 
developed that have proved effective in solving the problem. New 
combined condensation-diffusion plasma-ion coatings have been 
developed that are characterized by good protective properties 
at temperatures of 1,100-1,200 and that result in a turbine 
blade life of more than 1,000 hours. In the area of ceramic 
coatings, new coatings with a low heat conduction, high 
temperature coefficient of linear expansion, and heat resistance 
higher than that of familiar metallic coatings of the system 
Ni-Cr-Al-Y have been developed and are considered promising for 
use in the turbines of high-temperature gas turbine engines. 
Work to create metal-matrix composites is proceeding in the 
directions of improving their service characteristics and 
maximum realization of the starting components' properties. A 
boral composite material has been created that has an optimum 
combination of tensile strength (1,400 MPa), shear strength (an 
elasticity modulus of 230 GPa), fatigue resistance, and fracture 
toughness. The method of vacuum-compression impregnation has 
been used to develop promising fiber-reinforced composites. 
Another promising direction in aviation materials science is 
that of layered metal-polymer composites. The new layered 
composite alor (aluminum and acrylic plastic) is 10-15 percent 
less dense than aluminum sheets and more resistant to the 
development of fatigue cracks and has better static strength and 
damping properties. Bionics is another fundamentally new 
direction in creating aviation materials. Figures 3, tables 6.

  [Abstract] Studies of supersonic streams flowing from an 
axisymmetric nozzle in a nondesign mode have revealed 
unexplained azimuthal inhomogeneities in the distribution of 
their gas-dynamic parameters. One possible reason for such 
azimuthal inhomogeneity may be coherent vortex formations of the 
Taylor-Goertler vortex type. Longitudinal vortex structures have 
also been observed in the zone of interaction of a supersonic 
stream and liquid. Several publications have presented 
analytical descriptions of Taylor-Goertler instability in 
supersonic streams. The study reported herein is an expanded 
experimental investigation of the said phenomenon that includes 
sound measurements of variations in total pressure, data about 
the spectral profile of the wave numbers of three-dimensional 
inhomogeneities, and laser visualization of the stream's cross 
section. The experiments were conducted in a stream unit using 
equipment described elsewhere. The main difference between the 
present and previously reported experiments is that the 
experiments reported herein involved the use of a rotating 
nozzle, which made it possible to obtain data regarding the 
nature of the azimuthal inhomogeneities in the flow field of the 
entire stream (the range of variation of the azimuthal angle 
equaled 360 versus 57 in the previous experiments). 
The azimuthal inhomogeneities were studied in a supersonic 
underexpanded air stream flowing from an axisymmetric conical 
nozzle with a 0.02-m-diameter outlet into a submerged space. The 
stream had a Mach number of 1.5 at the outlet and, the ratio of 
the pressure at the nozzle section to the external pressure 
equaled 4.15. The Reynolds number, calculated on the basis of 
the characteristic stream velocity at the nozzle section, the 
dynamic viscosity in the submerged space, and the length of the 
first cell of the underexpanded stream, equaled 3.6 x 
10[.sup]6[/]. Because a comparison of the results obtained at 
nozzles with different degrees of inner-surface roughness 
demonstrated a link between the condition of the nozzle's inner 
surface and azimuthal inhomogeneity in the stream, the nozzles 
selected for use in the experiment had a surface rough spot 
height not exceeding 2.5 m. The intensity of the 
inhomogeneities observed differed for different azimuthal 
angles. The experiments confirmed that a significant 
inhomogeneity in the distribution of gas-dynamic parameters in 
the azimuthal direction is present in the outer part of the 
compressed layer of a supersonic underexpanded stream and that 
ignoring this fact may result in a systematic error in 
determining gas-dynamic parameters of as high as 40 percent. The 
spectral measurements of the wave numbers of three-dimensional 
inhomogeneities indicated a complex heteroscale set of 
interacting disturbances. A consolidation of the structures 
downward along the flow that was most likely caused by their 
interaction with one another and with the flow was observed. It 
was concluded that the observed quasi-periodic inhomogeneity of 
the distribution of gas-dynamic parameters along the azimuthal 
of the peripheral region of the stream is a result of 
disturbances that in all likelihood are disturbances of the 
Taylor-Goertler vortex type. Figures 6; references 18: 6

  [Abstract] The problem of calculating a three-dimensional 
compressible laminar boundary layer on a contoured delta wing 
with supersonic leading edges has been formulated and presented 
along with an algorithm for solving it. The algorithm has been 
used to perform calculations for the windward and leeward sides 
of a wing with a sweep angle (_ch_) of 45 given a Mach 
number (M[.sub][/]) of 3 and for the windward side of a 
wing with the same sweep angle and Mach numbers of 3 and 6 for 
any number of angles of attack (_a_). The effect of Mach 
number, 
angle of attack, and relative profile thickness on friction 
coefficient and its contribution to the wing's total drag have 
been investigated. Selected results of the calculations are as 
follows. The adjusted values found for a contoured wing exceed 
their values for a plane wafer by 30 percent. The difference 
between the values found for the friction coefficient on the 
nose and those on a plane wafer is much greater when 
M[.sub][/] = 6 than when M[.sub][/] = 3. 
Calculations of the effect of the angle of attack on the 
distribution of the friction coefficient on the leeward side of 
a contoured wing indicate that the friction coefficient 
decreases by about 15 percent when _a_ is increased by 5 
and that, given identical profile thicknesses and Mach numbers, 
the curves plotted for the friction coefficient (and also for 
the Stanton number) for different angles of attack are 
qualitatively similar to one another. A calculation of the 
contribution of the total intensity of friction 
(CF[.sub]x[/]) to the total drag (CX[.sub]0[/]) for each 
wing surface given Re[.sub]L[/] = 10[.sup]5[/] indicates 
that as M[.sub][/] increases, the value of CF[.sub]x[/] 
decreases somewhat when _a_ = 0 and increases when _a_ = 
5; 
however, wave drag decreases significantly, which results in an 
increase in the contribution of friction forces from 67 to 79 
percent when _a_ = 0 and from 21.5 to 43 percent when _a_ = 
5. The value of CF[.sub]x[/] is on average 15 percent 
greater for a contoured wing than for a delta wafer; however, 
wave drag is significantly greater in the case of a contoured 
wing, which reduces the contribution of friction forces to total 
drag when compared with that in the case of a plane delta wafer. 
An analogous phenomenon is observed when the angle of attack is 
increased. Although the value of CF[.sub]x[/] increases when 
_a_ is increased from 0 to 5, wave drag increases more, 
and 
as a result, the contribution of friction forces decreases from 
67 to 21.5 percent when M[.sub][/] = 3 and from 79 to 43 
percent when M[.sub][/]. Figures 6, tables 2; references 
12 (Russian).

  [Abstract] This paper examines the use of electroerosion 
machining (electic discharge machining, EDM) on current-carrying 
materials (copying and piercing operations). Conclusions reached 
from experience using EDM are expressed. Methods of improving 
EDM equipment are outlined, and include: increasing the range of 
pulse characteistics, better monitoring of the machining 
process, more flexible control, specialized machinery, new 
materials, special liquids for the machining process, and expert 
systems to design procedures. Flexible modules for piercing 
operations are described in detail. Current equipment achieves 
an accuracy of 0.01 mm. A number of machines in the SEP series 
have been developed for EDM. In one pass the machines can make 
up to 15,000 perforations; depending on the number and diameter 
of the holes this can take 30-70 minutes. The SEL-1 is a 
specialized machine tool with a semi-automatic mode, and it is 
described. It has two independent heads and machines the 
channels between the blade of monorotors. The accuracy achieved 
in 0.05 mm; the roughness ratio is 2.5. References 3 (Western).

  [Abstract] This paper clarifies the picture of the flow 
around triangular wings with a large sweepback at large attack 
angles. Experiments were conducted at subsonic speeds. 
Artificial turbulence was induced. Secondary eddy structures 
were formed which are similar to Taylor eddies between coaxial 
rotating cylinders. These structures lead to a laminar-turbulent 
transition. Creation of turbulence in the eddy may occur without 
altering the profile of the average speed, that is, without eddy 
decay. Figures 3; references 6: 4 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] One of the main conclusions of published 
discussions of optical reconstruction of holograms is that it is 
impossible to achieve correspondence between the lengthwise and 
crosswise scales of transformation of the field. This fact is a 
serious obstacle in analyzing antennas' directional patterns 
with optical information processing equipment to reconstruct 
microwave holograms. The optical reconstruction of microwave 
holograms in the absence of constraints on coaxiality of the 
optical transparent and image has been considered in a 
mathematical analysis. The radiation spectrum has been 
calculated as a function of the reference wave's angle of 
incidence, and the possibility of undistorted modeling of the 
directional pattern of a microwave antenna based on its hologram 
in the Fresnel region zone has been indicated for the 
one-dimensional case. An analogous consideration of a 
two-dimensional hologram confirmed the violation of the equality 
of the scales of transformation in the plane of the image and, 
accordingly, in spectral frequencies. Scale correspondence may 
be achieved only in a single cross section of the directional 
pattern, which must be taken into consideration when 
measurements are taken. Tables 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The problem of assessing the safety of AESs 
during severe accidents determines to a large degree future 
development of nuclear power industry. The most severe AES 
accidents that can lead to extensive radioactive contamination 
of the environment are the so called heat removal and reactivity 
type accidents. Currently there are two prevailing trends in 
solving the safety problem development of more reliable systems 
with multiple redundancy and additional safety barriers to 
propagation of fission products, or development of new in 
principle reactors wherein the possibility of accident creating 
processes is eliminated. The best way is an optimum combination 
of the two directions. With this in mind the authors discuss the 
possibility of using in water-cooled reactors fuel compositions 
based on fuel microelements used in high-temperature gas-cooled 
reactors (HTGR). The article examines an arrangement that gives 
a reactor unit a conceptually new quality. Preliminary analysis 
demonstrated that the proposed concept makes it possible to 
solve the AES radiation safety problem during an accident 
accompanied by complete loss of the heat-transfer medium and 
thus come substantially closer to solving the problem of 
reactivity accidents. The article describes a fuel module with 
fuel microelements, the reactor, neutron-physical and thermal 
physical features of the reactor core, and reactor behavior 
during a severe accident accompanied by complete loss of the 
heat-transfer medium. The use of such reactors will increase the 
cost of electrical power by 10-15%. Figures 5.

  [Abstract] The author proposes a new classification of 
subsystems of a system for automated control of technological 
processes in an AES power unit. The classification singles out 
the human operator as the main component that coordinates local 
goals control of power unit equipment, participates in control 
implementation and is responsible for safe operation of the AES. 
It is well known that the structure of any automatic control 
function consists of four components:information, situation 
identification, control decision making and implementation of 
the control decision. The classification for an operator support 
system will include four classes of systems: information 
support, situation assessment support, control decision making 
support and support of control decision implementation. The 
goals of each of the above classes of an operator support system 
are listed and explained. There are several serious problems 
with practical implementation of these goals by operator support 
systems. The most important problem is software certification. 
Among other problems are the impossibility in principle to 
simulate all failures of automation devices and a legal problem 
the responsibility for recommendations of the operator support 
system. A less serious problem is organization of personnel 
training interactively with support systems.

  [Abstract] Random (statistical) processes have played an 
important role in forming space distribution of radioactive 
contamination caused by the Chernobyl AES accident. There are 
fluctuations caused by nonuniform precipitation due to 
medium)scale (several hundred meters) atmospheric turbulence. 
Thereafter such statistical phenomena are called intermediate 
statistics. Local fluctuations of contamination density due to 
heterogeneous migration of radio nuclides (caused first of all 
by microrelief of the terrain) when the size of the studied 
territory is under 10 m are called local statistics. The 
objective of the work was to determine the character of 
statistical distributions caused by local and intermediate 
statistics, the number of soil samples necessary for determining 
the surface density of radioactive contamination with required 
accuracy, and parameters and structures of statistical 
regularities of the entire set of available data on soil 
pollution in Bryansk oblast settlements (selected because the 
largest volume of information is available for the oblast). At 
the local statistics level the distribution of radioactivity of 
soil samples is lognormal. At the intermediate statistics level 
the distribution is also lognormal, but with a larger standard 
deviation. Figures 8, references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Because of difficulties in performing direct 
radiochemical analysis of microscopic amounts of [.sup]90[/] 
Sr and [.sup]239+240[/]Pu and the ambiguity of 
derived results it is necessary to find ways for indirect 
estimates of concentrations of these radio nuclides in 
environmental samples based on the content of gamma radiators. [.sup]144 
[/] 
Ce content and concentration and isotope content 
of plutonium in soil samples were determined. The objective of 
the work was to develop a model that would make it possible to 
assess contamination of territories with [.sup]90[/]Sr and 
plutonium based on data of contamination of the territories with 
gamma-radiating radio nuclides. The first stage of the work 
consisted of experimental measurements that provided 
gamma-spectrometry and radiochemical analysis of soil samples 
taken at settlements with various levels of contamination 
located at various distances from the Chernobyl AES. During the 
second stage correlation analysis of Goskomgidromet [USSR State 
Committee for Hydrometeorology] data and experimental 
measurements conducted by the authors was performed. A linear 
model satisfactorily describes the relationship between [.sup]90[/] 
Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs in the remote zone 
(Bryansk oblast) soils and makes it possible to estimate 
territory contamination with [.sup]90[/]Sr based on data of [.sup]137[/] 

Cs contamination. Figures 4, references 10: 7

  [Abstract] The article presents results of calculation of 
the dose load of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm 
measured at the town of Baryshevka (145 km southeast of the 
Chernobyl AES and 45 km east of Kiev), Obninsk (107 km southwest 
of Moscow) and the central part of Moscow. Data for Kiev were 
not used because observations there only began on May 9. The 
highest concentration of radioactive products was observed in 
April and early May 1986. In Baryshevka the radiation dose has 
shaped by May 1, but in Obninsk and Moscow it kept rising in May 
and by June 1 it had doubled in Obninsk and tripled in Moscow. 
The main radiation dose is received by bone surfaces it is 
approximately four times higher than the dose received via lungs 
and liver and ten times higher than the dose received by bone 
marrow. Based on the obtained data the number of people that 
will develop cancer and the probability of cancer risk in 
Baryshevka, Obninsk and Moscow were calculated. Also calculated 
was the effective equivalent radiation dose due to inhalation of 
the sum of plutonium isotopes and [.sup]242[/]Cm for various 
population groups in Baryshevka. The calculated doses are 
approximate estimates from above, i.e. actual effective 
equivalent doses shall not exceed the calculated values. Figures

  [Abstract] Recently AESs have become an important source of 
tritium in the environment. Its content in AES regions in Russia 
and Ukraine has been increasing. Studies of tritium in the 
Ignalina AES region have been conducted since 1983. 
Concentration of tritium was measured in atmospheric moisture 
and precipitation and in surface, ground and artesian water. 
Emission of tritium in 1985-1992 as a result of Ignalina AES 
activity was calculated. Complex variances of distribution of 
tritium in the water objects in the Ignalina AES region 
demonstrate its important ecological role. Accumulation of 
tritium in vegetation can be up to 200 times higher than 
background amount. These effects can occur in the AES region, 
and they can affect dose loads. Figures 5, tables 3, references 
10: 8 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] The VVER-92 power plant design, like the APWR, 
Konvoi-95, MARS, ABWR, BWR-90, and Candu-3 designs, implements 
passive and active safety systems which prevent rupture of the 
core and protective hull, prevent leakage of radiation into the 
environment, and shut down the supply of energy and maintain 
control in emergency situations. These systems reduce the 
probability of a serious accident by an order of magnitude while 
reducing capital investment and cost price to 15-20%. The 
AR-600, SIR, SBWR, and V-600 designs make greater use of passive 
systems, which simplifies the design and reduces the number of 
components in the first circuit by a factor of 2-6. Construction 
based on these designs may begin in 1995-2005. The efforts of 
leading machine building and construction firms in the field of 
energy are focused on the development of new generation of 
plants using light-water reactors (up to 1300 MW). These plants 
should be built in the next 10-30 years and meet current 
requirements for safety and competitiveness. The VVER-92 design 
has an accident probability of about 2.5X10[.sup]-7[/] 
reactor-years. Predominantly passive systems are used in this 
design. The design conserves materials while providing a double 
hull for protection. Figures 3; references 31: 12 Russian, 19

  [Abstract] Hot flue gases are filtered by a stainless steel 
grid with a wire diameter of 0.003-0.004 mm. The housing of the 
unit contains multiple units consisting of several stages each. 
The height of the housing and the number of units are determined 
by the type of fuel and the rate of gas flow. Each unit contains 
a latticed disk attached to the face of the first stage. The 
diameter of each stage is determined by the diameter of the 
previous one. The effectiveness was tested. The number of solid 
particles is determined, as is the dependence of the degree of 
scrubbing on the number of filters for a particle size of 1.0 
m. Scrubbing decreased with the number of filters. By 
regulating the number of filters one can obtain the optimal 
ratio of the gas dynamic resistance of the scrubber and the 
degree of scrubbing. The device is most effective on particles 
1.0 m in size and greater. A 70% rate of scrubbing 
can be 
obtained. The device can be removed and cleaned for repeated 
use. Figure 1; table 1; references 4: 3 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] While areas of primary introduction of 
radioactive materials have been studied, secondary regions 
(where radioactive material has been introduced by geological 
and geochemical processes) have not. Studies of the rivers of 
southeast Belarus revealed the collection of radioactive 
material in sedimentation of terrigenic material, from organic 
and clay formations, and in soils in the humus, ortstein, and 
illuvial layers, as well as in various alluvial facies. 
  Channel central, and terrace flood plains were studied, as 
well as terraces above the flood plain. A table lists the 
location (geological formation), facies conditions, 
precipitation, the isotope and concentration, and examples of 
specific locations in Belarus. The ratio of present 
radioactivity to the 1986 and 1989 background is 2-5, and more 
rarely, 10. However, higher levels may be found along 
shorelines. Wind and water drive dust particles and aerosols to 
shorelines where they accumulate. It is recommended that 
radiometric surveying be done every 5-7 years. Table 1;

  [Abstract] A flowchart outlining a plan for ensuring 
Ukraine's radiation safety has been presented. The proposed plan 
calls for developing a monitoring system that is based on an 
automated system of current information and that includes five 
main components as follows: 

  -  ecological monitoring; 
  -  nuclear power plant monitoring; 
  -  an emergency control point; 
  -  a crisis center; 
  -  an automated radiation situation monitoring system. 

  The ecological monitoring component calls for developing an 
automated system of up-to-date information on Ukraine's 
environment and forecasts of any changes therein. The nuclear 
power plant monitoring will, through an automated system, 
provide current information regarding the condition of the 
environment of rayons with nuclear power plants and will also 
forecast changes likely to occur therein. These forecasts will 
be based on numerous data sources, including meteorological, 
geophysical, hydrological, geochemical, hydrogeological, 
aerologic, actinometric, radiometric, biological, and special 
medical observations. These forecasts will be used to plan 
environmental protection measures and measures to recover 
materials released from nuclear power plants. The emergency 
control point will serve as the site where recommendations are 
formulated regarding emergency measures to be taken at nuclear 
power plants and from which technical and organizational 
assistance can be provided to individuals managing emergency, 
rescue, and restoration operations during the clearing of 
accidents, catastrophes, natural disasters, or damage inflicted 
on nuclear power plants as a result of sabotage or military 
actions. The control center will also maintain communications 
with government and social organizations. The automated 
radiation situation monitoring system will monitoring and 
forecast radiation situations at nuclear power plants, in 
exclusion zones, and in observation zones during normal plant 
operations and in the event of an accident. The routing of 
information from source to user will vary depending on the type 
of monitoring being conducted (i.e., regular, operational, 
special). The exact interaction between the various monitoring 
system elements is still being worked out. Figure 1.

  [Abstract] The urgency of pneumatic monitoring of the 
physical and chemical properties of liquid media in production 
systems, e.g., by using a rigid-wall chamber-type transducer 
(KPP), prompted the development of an immersible capillary 
automatic viscosimeter which realizes the pneumatic method of 
measuring the liquid outflow through the capillary. The design 
and operating principle of the new instrument are described in 
detail, and a schematic diagram is cited. A system of 
differential equations which describes the processes in the 
automatic viscosity-to-pneumatic signal transducer is derived, 
and the equation's coefficients are summarized in a table. The 
device has a measurement range of 
(0.5-2.5)[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/] 
m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/] at a temperature of 20C, a 
response of 87[.sup].[/]10[.sup]-3[/] 
s/m[.sup]2[/]s[.sup]-1[/], and a basic adjusted error of 
3.5%. The pneumatic rectangular output signal has a 
duration 
equal to the monitored liquid outflow doze duration; the primary 
signal is converted by a secondary transducer into viscosity 
readings in a digital form. The automatic capillary 
viscosimeter's operations can be analyzed theoretically. Figures 
1; tables 2; references 6.

  [Abstract] The utility of long-term crack resistance 
measurements during stress-induced aging, usually accompanied by 
the development and realization of several combinations of 
adhesive and cohesive glued joint failures as a result of 
cracking, and the relative ease and accessibility of the wedge 
method for crack resistance testing in an aging-inducing 
environment, e.g., for glued rectangular slabs, prompted the 
selection of the crack propagation work in the glued joint per 
unit of linear measure or the energy release rate at separation 
as the crack resistance criteria. The energy release as measured 
by the wedge method rate is calculated and a formula is derived 
whereby the crack resistance criterion is expressed as a 
function of the wedge and slab thickness, crack length, and the 
slab metal modulus of elasticity. The proposed criterion and 
testing method make it possible to analyze the crack resistance 
of virtually any structural adhesive and determine its 
compliance with the safety requirements which ensure the 
operational reliability of the glued structure. It is noted that 
in mechanical engineering, the energy release rate in machines 
at which the crack virtually does not grow is used as the 
long-term crack resistance criterion. Figures 5; tables 2; 
references 8: 6 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] In all stages of production and conversioN of 
primary sources of energy, transport, and final use of the 
energy potential of primary energy sources there are 
considerable energy losses. It is crucial to determine the 
actual losses and quality of use of primary fuels. This paper 
presents an estimate of energy loss in the complete cycle of 
using the energy potential of primary fuel in material 
production. Examples of the quality of use of fuel-energy 
resources in various thermal technological systems in 
energy-intensive areas of industry are examined. A particular 
example presented is cast metallurgy. Schematics are presented 
to organize the consideration of energy conservation measures so 
that no options are overlooked. The principal possibilities for 
large-scale reduction of fuel-energy use are established based 
on intensive energy conservation measures. Figures 7.

  [Abstract] This paper summarizes ongoing work and plans to 
increase the effectiveness and reliability of steam turbines. 
The turbines were studied at the department of steam and gas 
turbines at the Moscow Energy Institute. A set of programs has 
been developed to determine the stress on turbine elements, in 
particular, shaft line vibration. The programs also formulate 
recommendations for design modification to increase vibration 
resistance. Examples are presented. The recommendations have 
eliminated the problem of self-exciting vibrations (at low 
frequencies) and in some cases have made the turbines more 
economical. The lifetime of turbines can be determined. Fatigue 
and corrosive fracturing can be evaluated. Figures 9.

Institute, Ukraine Ministry of Power and Electrification; UDC 
621.311.22] 
  [Abstract] In 1992, Ukraine's Ministry of Power and 
Electrification began financing work to create a new process for 
fuel utilization at thermal electric power plants. In the new 
process, natural gas is subjected to thermochemical processing 
before being burned. As part of research in this direction, a 
thermodynamic analysis was performed to compare a natural gas 
conversion method with endothermal effects to one with 
exothermal effects. The analysis established that endothermal 
conversion in steam-gas units would provide the biggest 
efficiency gains but would also necessitate the redesign of 
equipment currently in place at the republic's thermal electric 
power plants. Thermodynamic analysis of the binary unit in which 
natural gas is subjected to exothermal conversion before being 
burned demonstrated that choosing a thermal layout with a 
thermochemical gas-turbine superstructure would result in 
improved efficiency thanks to a reduction in unrecoverable 
losses in the heat production process. As a result, it would be 
possible to modernize existing thermal electric power plants in 
such a way that the efficiency of transforming heat to work 
could remain unchanged. R&amp;D performed jointly with the Power 
Generation Equipment Design Institute [Energoproyekt] confirmed 
the possibility of boosting the efficiency of natural gas 
utilization without altering existing thermal power generation 
equipment. Many of the currently used methods of reducing 
NO[.sub]x[/] emissions call for altering the gas-burning 
process by reducing the maximum jet temperature and creating 
enriched conditions by varying the intensity of mixing fuel and 
oxidizing agent. Two-stage combustion is one of the most radical 
methods of suppressing NO[.sub]x[/]. A system for burning 
natural gas after preliminary exothermal conversion is 
essentially no different from conventional two-stage burning 
systems. Consequently, modernizing thermal electric power plants 
by installing a gas turbine superstructure with thermochemical 
natural gas processing not only boosts plant efficiency but also 
significantly reduces NO[.sub]x[/] emissions. Calculations of 
key operating indicators before and after the proposed 
modernization were performed for scenarios assuming 
steam-turbine unit efficiencies of 39% and 41%. Figures 3, table 
1; references 3 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Now that Ukraine has gained independence, it 
must find ways of meeting its energy needs through its own 
energy resources. At present, Ukraine's own energy resources are 
providing no more than 30 percent of the power needed by the 
country. Because Ukraine virtually lacks reserves of gas-and-oil 
reserves, it should concentrate on developing its solid fuel 
reserves and using them to meet its energy needs. To make fuel 
supply as reliable as possible, Ukraine should locate its 
thermal electric power plants [TES] and fuel bases as close to 
one another as possible so as to create ``coal deposit-TES'' 
complexes. On the basis of R&amp;D conducted at the Ukraine Coal, 
Ore, and Gas Industry Scientific Research and Design Institute 
[UkrNIIproyekt] and State Mine and Ore Enrichment Plant Design 
Institute [Yuzhgiproshakht] developments, researchers from the 
institute Energoproyekt in Kharkov are working to develop ``coal 
deposit-TES'' complexes near the Barvenkovskoye and 
Bogdanovskoye deposits. The 12-km[.sup]2[/] Barvenkovskoye 
deposit, which is located in the south of the Kharkov Oblast, 
contains lignite and is suitable for open-pit mining. The 
Barvenkovskoye coal is of medium quality and has been 
characterized as follows: calorific value, 2,000 kcal/kg; 
moisture content, 45 percent; ash content, 13.7 percent; sulfur 
content, 1.5 percent; and yield of volatiles, 60 percent. The 
mine is suitable for stripping at a rate of 8 million tonnes of 
coal yearly, and that amount may expanded to 12 million tonnes 
in the future. Barvenkovskoye coal may be burned in boilers at 
electric power plants and is also suitable for briquetting and 
for coal-chemical processing. Its quality is similar to that of 
the lignites of the Ural and Aleksandriyskoye deposits, the 
Kansk-Achinsk Basin, and the Yugoslavian and German lignites 
that are widely used in power generation. The Bogdanovskoye 
deposit measures 24 by 20.5 km and is located in the new 
Northern Donbass Coal Region in the north of the Lugansk Oblast 
and is estimated to contain total reserves of 1,068 million 
tonnes and commercial-quality reserves of 860 million tonnes. 
Coal from the Bogdanovskoye deposit is characterized as follows: 
average calorific value, 4,362 kcal/kg; ash content, 24.8 
percent; moisture content, 17.2 percent; sulfur content, 1.6 
percent; yield of volatiles, 45.9 percent; ash melting point, 
1,110C; and level of easily sublimed Na[.sub]2[/]O in 
coals supplied to GRES, 1.2 percent. Preliminary estimates have 
indicated that the Barvenkovskoye deposit may be used as a basis 
for constructing a 1,600- to 1,800-MW state regional electric 
power plant [GRES] and that the Bogdanovskoye deposit is 
sufficient as the basis for a ``coal deposit-TES'' complex that 
includes a 2,700-MW GRES. In view of the great inertia of 
Ukraine's fuel-and-energy complex, technical and economic 
reports regarding the creation of ``coal deposit-TES'' complexes 
for the Barvenkovskoye and Bogdanovskoye deposits need to be 
completed in 1993-1994. Table 1.

  [Abstract] Ukraine's demand for oil and natural gas is 
substantially higher than oil and gas production in the 
Dnieper-Donets, sub-Carpathian and Crimea sub-Black Sea regions. 
The situation can hardly change to the better if geological 
surveying keeps concentrating along usual directions. The most 
promising way is the use of nontraditional natural sources of 
oil, gas and condensate first of all in deep Earth's crust zones 
and zones of gas hydrate formation (GHF) under the Black Sea. In 
the authors' opinion Ukraine has no other geological 
opportunities. In 1985-1987 12 commercial oil and gas deposits 
had been discovered on the northern board of the Dnieper-Donets 
Depression (DDD). The authors assessed the size of oil and gas 
reserves in those deposits using two different methods. Also oil 
and gas were discovered on the DDD southern board. There are 
also prospects for finding oil and gas deposits in Western 
Ukraine. Another non-traditional and promising direction is 
oil and gas prospecting in the astrobleme zone. There are six 
known astrobleme zones in Ukraine. The third direction is 
prospecting for and commercial use of subhydrate hydrocarbon gas 
and hydrocarbon gas hydrates in the Black Sea. The three 
proposed approaches should be viewed as additional to currently 
used traditional geological prospecting methods. Tables 1,

  [Abstract] The former Soviet Union was always one of the 
world's leading petroleum exporters, and most of its proved oil 
reserves were located in Russia. In the mid-eighties, however, 
oil recovery in Russia began declining and will likely continue 
to decline until the end of the century. In the near future, 
Russia may thus anticipate an oil shortage. Because Russia had 
never experienced the oil crises encountered in many 
industrially developed countries, the development of 
energy-saving technologies and intensification of the degree to 
which oil is processed were never emphasized as in the West. At 
the beginning of the nineties, the depth of oil refining in 
Russia averaged just 65 percent versus 82-82 percent in 
developed countries. At the same time, many Russian petroleum 
products are inferior to their foreign counterparts from both 
ecological and performance standpoints. The use of leaded 
gasoline, in particular, is a serious ecological problem. Only 
59 percent of diesel fuels produced in Russia may be classified 
as low-sulfur. Furnace residual fuel oil remains Russia's 
highest-volume petroleum product, and it accounts for 13-13.5 
percent of the fuel used to produce electric power. The quality 
of motor, industrial, and transmission oils produced at Russian 
oil refineries is inferior to that of their foreign 
counterparts. Russian oil refining industry is capable only of 
meeting the fuel needs of its obsolete machine tool park, 
vehicle fleet, and inventory of mobile and stationary power 
generating units and is not equipped to handle the technological 
breakthroughs anticipated in such sectors. The technological 
structure of most of Russia's oil refineries cannot support 
production of the required amounts of products meeting current 
quality levels, much less future ones. The All-Russian 
Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining has been 
collaborating with leading institutes in the different petroleum 
product-using sectors to develop the first scientifically 
substantiated forecast of Russia's future petroleum product 
needs. The forecast developed to date indicates a face-paced 
increase in the number of diesel-fueled motor vehicles and 
increases in the quantity and quality of high-octane gasolines. 
The following changes in Russia's production and utilization of 
petroleum products were recommended: increasing use of winter 
grades of diesel fuels until it accounts for 30 percent of all 
diesel fuels used, reducing the maximum sulfur content of diesel 
fuel used in vehicles driven in cities or areas of high air 
exchange from 0.2 to 0.05 percent, increasing the quality of 
other petroleum products such as bitumen and coke, and 
increasing the depth of oil refining to 72-75 percent within the 
next 5 years and to 82-85 percent within the next 20 years. 
Meeting these goals will require the construction of new 
complexes to process mazut into motor fuels and the redesign of 
existing facilities. The enormous capital investments required 
for such massive construction/reconstruction can only be 
achieved with adequate government support of the sector. Machine 
building-related R&amp;D and facilities that have been freed up 
as a 
result of conversion could be used to construct modern 
facilities permitting deeper processing of petroleum, which 
could in turn reduce expenditures of foreign exchange on 
imported petroleum products. The government must protect the 
sector's scientific research institutes to keep them from 
disappearing; restore destroyed scientific complexes of 
scientific research institutes, affiliates, and pilot plants; 
and modernize the sector's scientific research and design 
institutes and link them with machine building plants in 
integrated complexes. Table 1.

V.V. Barsukova, and N.M. Zhmykhova; UDC 553.982.2(470):665.6] 
  [Abstract] In the eighties, 30 to 35 new oil deposits were 
developed each year. Only seven were developed in 1990, and at 
present, more than 70 percent of proved oil reserves are now 
being developed. In 1992, the Russian Federation recovered 385 
million tonnes of oil and gas condensate, which accounted for 
about 85 percent of all oil recovered in the CIS. Of all the oil 
recovered in the Russian Federation, 67.0 came from Western 
Siberia. An analysis of current and projected development of 11 
oil deposits managed by the associations of the 
Glavtyumenneftegaz revealed that by the year 2000, oil recovery 
will increase at 6 of them. These six deposits are relatively 
small, however, and the increased oil recovery from them will 
not offset the decreases in oil recovery activity projected at 
the deposits of the Nizhnevartovsk, Megion, and Langepis 
associations. The association Nizhnevartovsk (the largest of the 
11 associations) accounted for 19.8 percent of all oil recovered 
in 1993 and is projected to remain the leader in oil recovery 
through 1995 (accounting for 17.8 percent of the oil recovered. 
By 2000, however, it is projected to drop to third place behind 
the associations Yugansk and Surgut. The percentage of 
``rejuvenation'' of the oil recovered by the associations Pur, 
Urengoy, Megion, and Krasnoleninsk has been calculated at about 
40 percent, and a figure of 22 percent has been calculated for 
the region as a whole. The All-Russian Scientific Research 
Institute of Petroleum Refining has studied virtually all new 
deposits in Western Siberia. The following have been deemed the 
most interesting: Priobskaya (heavy with high sulfur and 
paraffin contents and a 45 percent maximum yield of light 
fractions, a valuable raw material for jet fuel, and interesting 
as a source for high-viscosity base oils and vacuum distillate 
for catalytic or hydrocracking; Kharampurskaya (heavy with a low 
sulfur content, high paraffin content, and 64 percent maximum 
yield of light fractions and promising as a source of gasoline 
with an octane number of 59, jet fuel, winter diesel fuel, and 
low-viscosity boiler fuel); Severno-Komsomolskaya (heavy with a 
high sulfur content, virtually free of gasoline fractions, and a 
source of components of jet and diesel fuels and low pour-point 
oils not requiring dewaxing); and Sugmutskaya (a high-sulfur, 
low-paraffin, high-potential oil that may with deep refining 
yield virtually all types of low-sulfur fuels and good-quality 
base oils). By the year 2000, the amount of high-sulfur oil 
produced by the Glavtyumenneftegas will increase from 52.5 to 
55.2 percent; however, the mean-weighted content of sulfur in 
both high- and low-sulfur oils will decrease somewhat. The oil 
recovery situation is not nearly as serious in other areas of 
Russia as in Western Siberia. The most promising oils in the 
European part of Russia are the following recently discovered 
oils of the Timanovo-Pechorsk region and the shelves of the 
Baltic, White, Barents, and Okhotsk seas: Kharyaginskaya (a 
paraffin content of 21 percent, a possible source of jet fuel, 
and potential 19.4 percent content of base oils with a viscosity 
index of 98), Peschanoozerskaya (low-sulfur, 84 percent content 
of light fractions to 350C, and source of TS-1 jet fuel and 
summer and winter diesel fuels with a viscosity index of 99), 
Kaliningradskaya, and Sakhalinskaya. Tables 5.

  [Abstract] Synthetic zeolites are porous crystalline 
aluminosilicates of alkaline or alkaline earth metals with a 
strictly regular pore size and unique adsorption and catalytic 
properties. The All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of 
Petroleum Refining [VNIINP] has been researching the conditions 
of synthesizing different types of zeolites and zeolite 
production processes since the 1960s. The VNIINP has recently 
developed promising processes for producing type Y zeolites. A 
no-waste process has been developed to synthesize NaY zeolite 
that entails producing the silica needed to synthesize the 
zeolite by electrodialysis of a sodium silicate solution and 
then using the alkaline solutions formed during electrodialysis 
and crystallization to dissolve the silicate materials for 
return to the production process. Other studies performed at the 
VNIINP resulted in the establishment of six general laws 
governing crystallization of pentacyls of the TsVK series that 
were in turn used to develop a method of synthesizing zeolites 
with 100 percent phase purity. In 1989-1990, the VNIINP 
developed a no-waste process for producing pentacyls with a very 
low (0.1 weight percent) sodium oxide content, i.e., TsVN 
zeolites, according to which the mother liquors are returned to 
the process in the stage of preparing the starting reaction 
mixture. Working jointly with Byelarus Technological Institute, 
the VNIINP synthesized molecular sieves with different 
structures: AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5, AlPO[.sub]4[/]-20, 
AlPO[.sub]4[/]-44, SAPO-5, SAPO-44, etc. Catalysts based on 
them are now being tested. The wide-pore sieves 
AlPO[.sub]4[/]-5 and SAPO-5 have shown the most promise and 
highest stability: They do not break down when heated up to 
1,040C or when treated with steam at 600C. Both sieves 
also have rather high sorption volumes. Modified TsVM and 
TsVK-XI zeolites have been used as a basis for developing the 
catalyst SGK-1m for dewaxing the base of I-20A and I-12A 
industrial oils and the heavy oil distillates used as a base for 
ASV-5 high-viscosity motor oil. The catalyst SGK-1R has been 
developed for single-stage hydrorefining of highly aromatized 
catalytic cracking gas oils. New processes have also been 
developed for two-stage hydrocracking of vacuum distillate at a 
pressure of 15 MPa to produce jet fuel and for light 
hydrocracking at a pressure of 5-7 MPa to produce diesel fuel. 
The new process has been used to create the zeolite-containing 
catalysts NMG-70 and GKO-1. A series of zeolite-containing 
catalysts has also been developed for light hydrocracking of 
vacuum distillate with a transformation depth of more than 70 
percent. The zeolite RZEU is used as a splitting component. 
Catalysts of the series GKR consisting of 40 percent RZEU 
possess good splitting activity but are not selective enough 
with respect to the diesel fuel fraction. Catalysts of the 
series LGK are more active and selective than their rival 
counterpart ZMAG 95 AS produced by Haldor Topso. Tables 10; 
references 31 (Russian).

``Ukrgazprom'')] 
  [Abstract]Like several other countries of Western Europe 
Ukraine does not possess sufficient energy sources. However, 
unlike the former, the Ukraine meets most of its demand (up to 
80% in 1990-1992) by importing gas from only two places ) 
Russia and Turkmenistan. Ukraine's energy consumption per capita 
is around 6.5 tonnes of equivalent fuel. Energy consumption per 
$1 of GDP is 4 to 6 times higher than in the USA, Western Europe 
and Japan. Natural gas consumption for 2000-2010 is forecast at 
70 to 80 billion m[.sup]3[/] a year. The article lists 
possible sources that could satisfy the demand more efficient 
utilization of Ukraine's gas resources; the use of 
nontraditional sources; receiving gas as payment for the use of 
Ukraine's gas pipeline system by Russia, Turkmenistan and other 
countries; buying gas from the Russian Federation, which makes 
economic sense for both Russia and Ukraine; buying natural gas 
from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Algeria, Norway 
and Netherlands; and buying liquefied natural gas from Algeria, 
Libya, Qatar, Nigeria and other countries. Ukraine could also 
use her intellectual and industrial potential and participate in 
projects of exploitation of natural gas fields in other 
countries and transporting the gas via Ukraine. Diversification 
of gas supply sources will create necessary conditions for 
reliable and safe functioning of the national economy of 
Ukraine. Figures 1, tables 1, references 6: 1 Ukrainian, 5

<F P=106> [Article by General Director, DGP [State geophysics </F>
enterprise] ``Ukrgeofizyka'', M.V. Kivshyk under the ``Oil and 
Gas Geology'' rubric 
  [Abstract] Problems of geophysics are closely related to 
the extremely urgent problem of increasing oil and gas reserves 
in Ukraine. The current status of geophysical methods for oil 
and gas prospecting in Ukraine has been determined to a large 
degree by the status of geophysical service in Ukraine within 
the former Soviet Union and the level of geophysics in the 
latter. As a result, in terms of geophysical instrument building 
and geophysics technology Ukraine is lagging substantially 
behind highly developed countries. This becomes clear from the 
comparison of technical and technological means used in Ukraine 
and in the West. For instance, equipment for recording seismic 
information can record information in 48 or 96 channels at a 
time, whereas equipment used in the West and USA can record 
information in 960 channels plus. The best computers used in 
Ukraine for processing geophysical information have an 8 MB RAm, 
2-4 GB hard disk and operate at 2 million operations per second, 
while in the West these parameters are 80-100 MB, 12-16 GB and 
100 million operations per second, respectively. The use of 
personal computers in Ukraine is in its initial stage due to the 
lack of money for buying them. Oil and gas geophysics in Ukraine 
is in critical state. Immediate retooling of geophysical 
operations in Ukraine is mandatory. The author suggests measures 
aimed at solving this problem.

  [Abstract] At the present time Ukraine needs new directions 
of low depth oil and gas prospecting. A new nontraditional 
object of geological prospecting wherein efficient increase of 
oil and gas supply does not depend on foreign investment was 
proposed. The authors had been able to discover and justify 
scientifically a unique object for prospecting for hydrocarbons 
within the main oil and gas producing region of Ukraine the 
Northern Board of the Dnieper-Donets Depression (DDD). The work 
was conducted in accordance with the ``Integrated Program for 
Studying Prospects of Oil and Gas Capacity of the Crystalline 
Foundation of the Northern Board of the Dnieper-Donets 
Depression in 1989-1995'' that was approved in 1988. A 1991 
forecast estimated that resources of hydrocarbons were equal to 
186 million tons. The Program was actually implemented in only 
three years. New methods and procedures for trap detection and 
preparation, forecasting etc. had been developed. New oil and 
gas-containing areas were discovered. A non-standard set of 
geophysical studies had been developed, which resulted in highly 
efficient geological prospecting. Ten new oil and gas fields 
were discovered, and gas capacity in two other zones was 
established. Industrial-size accumulations of hydrocarbons were 
detected in areas that before had been considered non-promising. 
According to current estimates hydrocarbon resources in these 
areas exceed 250 million tonnes. References 6, all Russian.

  [Abstract] The development of a considerable industrial 
potential, particularly in oil and gas production, transport and 
consumption, has led to uncontrolled ecological catastrophes 
comparable to catastrophes caused by wars. The current 
protection technology is inefficient, poorly yields itself to 
control and inadequate to the scope of destruction factors. 
Mechanisms of pulsed detonation feeding and sputtering of 
powders and liquids for fire extinguishing, setting up light and 
heat protection screens in order to prevent explosions, and 
spraying of binding coatings are being studied at the Problems 
of Material Science Institute of the Academy of Sciences of 
Ukraine. Key propositions of the theory of pulsed protective 
action have been developed. A number of pulse devices have been 
built and tested at test sites under close to real-life 
conditions. A multibarrel unit that periodically creates 
gas-dispersed streams with controlled parameters comprise the 
most powerful pulsed system. The units are mounted on tank 
chassis (50 barrels), gun carriages (9, 16 or 25 barrels) or on 
skids (4, 7, 8 or 9 barrels). An important advantage of a 
multibarrel unit is the capability to push and spray any 
granular powders, liquids and viscous substances. The article 
presents test results of various units. Simple explosive devices 
and fire extinguishing bombs also have been developed and 
tested. Multibarrel units can be effectively used for fighting 
forest fires, as well as fires at oil and gas installations and 
chemical industry enterprises, fires that can happen at airports 
during emergency landing of an aircraft, and ship fires caused 
by spilled petroleum products. Figures 4.

  [Abstract] A new principle has been proposed for raising 
sunken objects by means of precisely manufactured hollow ceramic 
or glass spherical elements that have relatively large diameters 
and that are formed into modules with a lifting force ranging 
from 1 to 10 tonnes or more. The new method and flotation 
devices, which were developed at the Nikolayevsk Shipbuilding 
Institute, offer the following advantages: reliability and 
simplicity of distributing the lifting forces required along the 
hull of a sunken object lying at great depths thanks to the use 
of individual modules capable of withstanding significant 
pressures and conventional cables to attach the lifting modules 
to the sunken object; simplicity of regulating forces and 
executing the operations of eliminating list and trim by varying 
the number of lifting modules and by rational distribution of 
the sites at which they are attached to the sunken object; high 
degree of mechanization of the operations entailed in the 
lifting process; and achievement of the required lifting speed 
thanks to a combined lifting technique where most of the lifting 
forces are created by underwater modules and the rest are 
created by hoisting mechanisms tied to the sunken object by 
cable; improvement of the technological level of lifting thanks 
to a reduction in the size and numbers of ropes in the winding 
tackle systems used as additional lifting equipment; reduction 
of the installed capacity of the lowering and raising equipment 
thanks to the fact that the lifting modules are attached to the 
sunken object one after the other rather than simultaneously; 
and no stringent requirements regarding positioning the vessels 
involved in lifting the sunken object. The new lifting modules 
filled with spherical ceramic fillers with an aggregate density 
of 359 kg/m[.sup]3[/] have been manufactured and tested. The 
first has a lifting force of 10 kN, weighs 573 kg, and has a 
volume of 1.60 m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 1.13 x 
1.25 x 1.13 m. The second has a lifting force of 50 kN, weighs 
2,861 kg, and has a volume of 7.97 m[.sup]3[/] and overall 
dimensions of 1.93 x 2.14 x 1.93 m, and the third has a lifting 
force of 100 kN, weighs 5,702 kg, and has a volume of 15.88 
m[.sup]3[/] and overall dimensions of 2.93 x 2.69 x 2.93 m.

  [Abstract] A shaft line with a mass distribution featuring 
a suspended mass on two supports one of which is pliable is 
mathematically modeled to examine the effect of the rigidity of 
the pliable support on the dynamic characteristics of a 
propeller shaft-stern deadwood bearing system. The dynamics of 
the shaft drive on the Arktika nuclear icebreaker are calculated 
using this model. It was found that as the capacity of 
icebreaker power plants increases, the amount of vibrations in 
the stern end of the hull becomes untenable, and leads to 
fatigue cracks and damage to the deadwood bearings. The energy 
of the interaction of the propeller and the ice must be 
optimally distributed. Two cases are examined: 1) a single 
impact of the propeller blade with the ice and transition 
processes in the shaft line caused by the impact; 2) induced 
transverse vibrations of the shaft line due to a periodic pulse 
load caused by the interaction of the propeller with the ice. 
The optimal rigidity of the deadwood bearing support is 150 
MN/m. The problem of determining the rigidity parameters of the 
supports of the deadwood bearings should be solved by optimizing 
the bearing parameters in each case using supports with an 
adjustable rigidity, which makes it possible to adjust them away 
from the critical frequency over the entire range of frequencies 
of rotation of the propeller shaft. Figures 5; references 4 
(Russian).

  [Abstract] This paper examines the creation of condensed 
heat-resistant coatings for cooled working blades of the gas 
turbines of aviation engines and energy plants. The evaporation 
of ZnO[.sub]2[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics are 
studied and a coating with a columnar structure is formed. The 
basic thermophysical properties of ceramic coatings are studied. 
Ceramic condensed coatings are highly resistant to thermal loads 
and were not damaged during prolonged tests on aviation engines. 
The coatings protect blade surfaces from high-temperature 
corrosion and the blade material from weakening due to high 
temperatures. The characteristics of ceramic coatings in general 
are listed. Two ceramics were tested, KDP-1 and KDP-4. The 
conductivity of KDP-1 was close to that of a ZrO[.sub]2[/] 
single crystal. The main cause of coating failure is oxidation 
of the ceramic-metal interface; other causes are listed. The 
oxidation causes a continuous reduction in the adhesion of the 
ceramic coating. This may be reduced by alloying and reducing 
the diffusive mobilty of oxygen. At temperatures below 1100 
the coatings may last 10,000-15,000 hours. Figures 4; tables 3;

  [Abstract] This paper presents a numerical analysis of a 
new effect of shock wave focusing which is caused by a thin 
extended gas layer of lower density at the side wall of a 
cylindrical tube when a wave is reflected from the flat end of 
the tube. The gas layer is in front of the shock wave and normal 
to the wave. It is shown in a model (using Euler equations and 
an antidiffusion scheme) that the gas dynamic parameters in the 
vicinity of the center of the end face increase by a factor of 
5-10 (for strong shock waves) compared to the parameters 
trailing a reflected stationary flat shock wave. The diffuse gas 
layer may form naturally due to heating by heat fluxes from the 
front of a strong shock wave, or may be formed artificially by 
heating the surface. An isobar figure illustrates shock wave 
configuation and currents behind the shock wave just after it is 
reflected from the end of the tube. The increased pressure is a 
local and short-lived effect, but it is strong. Large-scale 
eddies are formed after the shock wave is reflected. The effect 
must be experimentally verified. Figures 5; references 8: 6

    [NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST Jul-Sep 93, etc.] 
[Editorial report] New oil and gas fields with potential for 
industrial exploitation have been discovered in Ukraine thanks 
to novel exploration methods (Kiev NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST 
[OIL &amp; GAS INDUSTRY] No. 3 Jul-Sep 1993). Two gas deposits 
and 
10 fields containing both oil and gas were detected at the 
northern edge of the Dniepr-Donets Depression, the main oil and 
gas producing region of Ukraine. The newly discovered fields 
are believed to contain over 250 million tons of hydrocarbons, 
and the stratigraphic range of the commercially exploitable oil 
and gas deposits is over 1000 meters. This is the first time 
that industrial quantities of hydrocarbons have been found in 
Ukraine in crystalline basement rock, which was previously 
considered to be unpromising for exploration. The deposits' 
relative proximity to the surface means that they can be 
exploited with existing equipment, material and technology, and 
without foreign investors. These circumstances heighten the 
significance of the discovery for Ukraine, which lacks the 
materials and equipment required to explore its main hydrocarbon 
reserves, located at depths of 5,000 to 10,000 meters (Moscow 
IZVESTIYA 12 Sep 92). The deposits have the added advantage of 
being located near large industrial users in Kharkhov, Okhtyrka 
and Sumy. 
  The new exploration techniques consist of a set of highly 
accurate and efficient nonstandard geophysical surveys developed 
for detecting oil and gas in sedimentary mantle and crystalline 
basement rock. One innovation, conducting zonal seismic surveys 
longitudinally along discordant faults, made it possible to 
detect fairly long lines of folds rapidly and prepare them for 
exploratory drilling. Seismostratigraphic analysis was used to 
detect untraditional forms, such as horst, paleovalleys and wide 
fractured zones, which characterize structure in sedimentary 
mantle. The authors of the NAFTOVA I GAZOVA PROMYSLOVIST 
article proved experimentally that low-value anomalies in 
pseudoacoustic and pseudointerval rates associated with 
fractured rock zones are caused by high porosity and, for the 
most part, with gas saturation. These survey methods were 
developed under a state program drafted by the authors and can 
be used in other territories of Ukraine. 
  Ukraine has been seeking to reduce its 80 percent dependence 
on gas imports from Russia and Turkmenistan by boosting domestic 
production, now at one-third its 1990 level. A comprehensive 
national program ``Ukrainian Gas and Oil to 2010'' is addressing 
problems in oil and gas exploration, production, and processing 
(Kiev DEM0KRATYCHNA UKRAYINA 3 Jul 93).

  [Abstract] The characteristics of the physicochemical state 
of the radionuclides discharged in the Chernobyl accident are 
examined. The reasons for variations in the forms of presence of 
radioactive fallout over the territory of the Ukraine are 
discussed, as well as the mechanisms causing a change in 
mobility of radionuclides with time under different 
landscape-geochemical conditions. The processes of natural 
self-purification of territories from radioactive pollutants are 
evaluated, followed by a prediction of radiation conditions over 
the polluted territories for a period from 5 to 1000 years. The 
following are among the phenomena observed in the considered 
area. There is a multisided dynamics of the vertical migration 
of radionuclides in ground and soil horizons related to changes 
in the mobility of radionuclides. There is a considerable 
nonuniformity in the distribution of radioactivity in samples of 
soils, plants, water, bottom deposits and hydrobionts. There is 
fractionation of radionuclides in the fluvial network caused by 
the forms of entry of nuclides and their different 
physicochemical properties. There is active destruction of fuel 
particles and conversion of radionuclides into migratory forms. 
There is a nonuniformity in the distribution of radionuclides 
expressed in a difference in the dose loads by an order of 
magnitude for biosystems even in small test areas within the 
30-km critical zone and beyond its limits. Under conditions of 
explosive discharge of radionuclides there is a great difference 
in the accumulation factors for the very same plants in 
different regions. Considerable redistributions of radionuclides 
are found in the system of Dnepr reservoirs and the Black Sea. 
Mathematical simulation made it possible to organize a databank 
for predicting the dynamics of radionuclide pollution of soils, 
water and bottom deposits. Dynamic models were constructed for 
estimating the formation of radionuclide pollution doses for the 
people living in regions with an increased content of 
radionuclides. The accumulated experience shows that the results 
of geochemical research are fundamental in solving technical, 
agroindustrial and biomedical problems. On the basis of these 
and other findings a list of problems in the field of 
geochemistry of radionuclides which must solved in the near 
future is given.

  [Abstract] A method is proposed for choosing the parameters 
for a process for the thermal destruction of toxic chlororganic 
wastes using the maximum admissible concentration (MAC) of 
discharge of nondecomposing and secondary toxic compounds. 
Successive procedures are outlined for choosing the parameters 
for this process of destruction of chlororganic wastes. The 
required degree of destruction of the initial toxic substance is 
determined on the basis of the MAC. The H/Cl ratio in the toxic 
substance is used in determining the composition of the heat 
carrier ensuring the bonding of chlorine in the destruction 
products. Computed data are given on the necessary degree of 
destruction for the most typical chlororganic wastes and the 
results of thermodynamic computations of the quantity of toxic 
products of destruction as a function of process temperature and 
composition of the heat carrier are presented. The feasibility 
of using E-plasmotrons as generators of a high-temperature 
medium for the thermal destruction of chlororganic toxic wastes 
is validated. Instead of large stationary plants it is deemed 
essential that small mobile apparatus be used, constructed on 
the modular principle so that one module can be replaced by 
another for accommodation to changing physicochemical properties 
of the wastes. Figures 3; references 7: 3 Russian, 4 Western.

  [Abstract] A high content of heavy metals in sewage is 
characteristic for all major industrial centers (data for 
Moscow, Riga, Ryazan, Izhevsk and Chelyabinsk are given). It is 
essential that these be removed and currently employed methods 
are inefficient and inadequate. A method is therefore proposed 
for the utilization of the sewage sediments with a high content 
of heavy metals using acid reagents (sulfuric and nitric acids). 
The optimum time and temperature regimes of the process are 
determined. The developed method, which was tested in large 
samples of sediment from various cities, makes it possible to 
eliminate 95-100% of all metals. The purified sediment, 
after 
the neutralization of residual acidity, is processed into 
organomineral fertilizer; a table gives the content of nutrients 
in comparison with some other organic fertilizers. Another table 
shows that the residual content of heavy metals in the purified 
sediment is below the norms stipulated for this type of 
fertilizers in other countries (United States, Germany, 
Netherlands, Switzerland). The separated metals (such as zinc, 
nickel, copper and chromium) are relatively easily reworked into 
concentrates and are used in the preparation of construction 
materials which are of value in industry. Concentrates of 
chromium and nonferrous metals are then suitable as raw material 
in manufacturing processes. The resulting products, completely 
waste-free, are ecologically safe. Figure 1; references 8; 6

  [Abstract] Among the principal fundamental physical 
constants it is the Newton gravitational constant G which is 
least precisely determined. The other constants are known with 
an error not greater than 1 x 10[.sup]-6[/], but the most 
optimistic estimate of the error in determining G is 1 x 
10[.sup]-4[/]. Despite the innumerable studies of G, there is 
still no explanation for the strong discrepancies between the 
results of multiple determinations of G even with repeated 
determinations by the same experimental method. In an attempt to 
introduce clarity into this problem, an analysis was made of the 
constraints on a theoretical model of representation of the 
relative motion of trial gravitationally interacting bodies on 
an artificial satellite which result in a low systematic error 
level and provide a possibility for refining the gravitational 
constant from measurements of the relative motion by two orders 
of magnitude. Constraints related to the neglecting in the 
theoretical model of relativistic corrections to the description 
of the Earth's gravity field, neglecting of the zonal harmonics 
of expansion of the Earth's gravitational potential beginning 
with a harmonic of some particular number and influence of lunar 
and solar tidal potentials are examined. The results clearly 
indicate that considerable discrepancies in the results of large 
series of G determinations in surface laboratory experiments may 
occur as a result of the inadequacy of the used theoretical 
model. [The satellite experiment referred to in the analysis was 
described by A. J. Sanders, et al., PHYS. REV. D, Vol. 26, p 
489, 1992.] Figures 2; references 16: 7 Russian, 9 Western.

  [Abstract] The dynamics of appearance of linear cloud 
elements over faults after nuclear explosions at test sites in 
Kazakhstan and in China in 1988, 1989 and 1990 is examined. The 
study involved an analysis of NOAA meteorological space 
photographs at 1:25 000 000. A seismotectonic approach was used 
as the basis for this research. During this period there were 
ten nuclear tests in Kazakhstan and two in China. The distance 
between these test sites was 1200 km. In three cases there were 
no cloud lineaments because it was clear weather, in a fourth 
case there was a negative result, but in the other six cases, 
each of which is described in detail, there was a significant 
correlation between the nuclear shots and presence of cloud 
lineaments. A comparison of the times of appearance of cloud 
lineaments after explosions in Kazakhstan and China shows that 
in China the atmospheric reaction to the explosions began 
earlier -- after eight minutes and after three hours, whereas in 
Kazakhstan it was after four hours. Cloud lineaments did not 
appear over the Kazakh test site on the first space photographs 
after a nuclear explosion. This is possibly not because of 
atmospheric conditions, but because of different crustal 
viscosity and elasticity. A figure accompanying the text shows 
the propagation of disturbances along faults from the test 
sites. The energy of the Semipalatinsk shots is propagated over 
an area of 300 000 square kilometers, whereas that from the 
Chinese shots extends over an area of 200 000 square kilometers. 
It is concluded that the propagation of disturbances from 
nuclear explosions can be traced along faults from the dynamics 
of the linear cloud anomalies above the latter. Figure 1;

  [Abstract] When a short-range prediction of an earthquake 
becomes known to the public it may result in panic and urgent 
measures by the government become especially urgent. Especially 
since the Armenian earthquake there has been improper 
dissemination of earthquake warnings by the press and some 
specialists, many of the latter working outside the field of 
their competence. This includes astronomers, specialists in 
biofields, those with extrasensory perception and amateurs. 
Among the seven hundred such predictions reviewed by an expert 
group not one of them proved valid. Several specialists are 
named who have been exceptionally active in making and 
disseminating alarming and unwarranted predictions. This also 
happens in other countries. This problem was dealt with in two 
resolutions of the 22d General Assembly of the European 
Seismological Commission (Barcelona, 20 September 1990) calling 
for a moratorium on such not fully validated predictions and 
calling for a code of ethics for those issuing such warnings. 
Such a code was adopted at Strasbourg on 18 October 1991 (the 
Russian text of this code, as well as that of the two mentioned 
resolutions, is given). It is requested that all who make such 
predictions in Russia direct them for review to:

  [Abstract] Variations of the geomagnetic field at 0.01-10 
Hz recorded at the epicenter of the Loma Prieta earthquake (M = 
7.1) may be explained by a set of electric dipoles which appear 
due to a change in the pore liquid pressure near faults 0.1-10 m 
in size. It is sufficient for these sources to arise in a narrow 
water-bearing stratum (about 10 m) near the surface (10-100 m 
deep). The magnitude of the effect depends heavily on the size 
of faults, frequency, and the depth of bedding of the layer, and 
to a lesser extent, on the expanse of the layer, conductivity, 
and the number of faults. Anomalies were recorded more than a 
month before the earthquake, but the most powerful anomalies 
began three hours before the earthquake in the 0.01-0.4 Hz range 
and exceeded the background by two orders of magnitude. The 
model presented here is based on pulse processes of fault 
formation in the Earth's crust, which cause disturbances in a 
wide range of frequencies, including he ULF range. In this range 
electrokinetic and piezomagnetic effects are predominant. 
However, the piezomagnetic field does not match observations in 
magnitude or frequency. Electrokinetic effects agree 
satisfactorily with experimental data. The model presented 
here can determine parameters of the fault formation process, 
the size distribution of faults, and the rate of appearance.

  [Abstract] As the end of the 20th century approaches and 
the new century is in the offing, there is a wide array of 
problems which must be dealt with in order to solve problems in 
astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography. These include 
organization of a planetary geocentric coordinate system, a 
global position system and a VLBI network; study of the figure, 
physical fields and internal structure of the Earth with 
allowance for their secular, long- and short-period changes with 
time; determination of an inertial coordinate reference system, 
parameters of rotation of the Earth and polar movement; study of 
the figures and physical fields of the moon, planets and their 
satellites and defining coordinate reference systems for the 
Moon, Venus, Mars and other planets; determination of the center 
of inertia of the Earth-Moon system for the epoch; organization 
of state astrogeodetic, geodetic, gravimetric and vertical 
control networks; organization of special- purpose local, sea 
and space geodetic networks; tie-in of different coordinate 
systems and physical fields; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and 
cartographic support for astroengineering programs in near and 
distant space; astrogeodetic, gravimetric and cartographic 
support for study of crustal movements, lithospheric plates and 
the continents, changes in sea level and the world ocean, 
prediction of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and catastrophes 
of different types; monitoring of natural and technogenic 
environments; implementation of land, sea and aerospace surveys; 
production of graphic, digital and electronic topographic and 
thematic maps. These problems cannot be solved without the 
coordination of long-term scientific and technical programs in 
the field of astrogeodesy, geodynamics and cartography during 
1995-2010 by the academies of sciences of the CIS and 
Rosgosstandard. The article discusses the organization of a 
network of astrogeodetic observatories (AGO) for uniformly 
covering the entire area of the country and the requirements on 
a new highly accurate fundamental astrogeodetic network, without 
which work on the enumerated problems is without promise. The 
work of the AGO, on which the entire network hinges, also is 
described, as is the role played by GLONASS, Navstar and Lageos 
satellites. Work already done and that which is planned is 
outlined. How the basic system and its subsystems will allow 
solution of key problems is discussed.

  [Abstract] Remote sensing activities in Russia are 
reviewed. Past achievements are summarized and the ongoing work 
is discussed in detail. The collection and sale of remote 
sensing data constitute a potential source of foreign exchange 
and it is the intention to make these materials available on the 
world market. Collaboration with the developing countries will 
also be stressed. However, the even more important role played 
by remote sensing materials in the development of the Russian 
economy is emphasized (exploration for mineral resources, 
environmental protection, etc.). The following are regarded as 
the immediate objectives in the field of development of detailed 
observation subsystems: modernization of the Resurs-FI and 
Resurs-FII satellites (1994-1996) for increasing their 
technical-economic efficiency by improving resolution on the 
ground by 20-40%, increasing the area of the survey from 
one 
vehicle and lengthening its lifetime; activation (1993-1994) of 
a new vehicle of the Resurs-F series with a ground resolution 
better than 5 m; flight tests (1996-1997) of a new vehicle of 
the Resurs-F series which will replace the Resurs-FI and F-II 
(work on creating the new vehicle is being funded by the Russian 
Space Agency); adaptation of the information received from the 
new vehicles to the tasks of different departments; 
modernization of the surface complex for the interbranch 
processing of information to a level which will make it possible 
to draw a wide range of Russian entrepreneurs into the 
subsequent processing and application of the results; 
development and introduction of technologies for the digital 
processing of satellite images within the framework of 
geoinformation systems for the production of precise 
cartographic materials oriented on the needs of planning and 
control agencies, search for and evaluation of natural resources 
and environmental monitoring. Russia must be prepared for active 
participation in the international satellite information market. 
The Russian government and companies, especially the Priroda 
State Center, are ready to cooperate with companies in other 
countries in marketing of products developed using Russian 
remote sensing systems.

  [Abstract] After reviewing the past accomplishments of the 
Russian mapping industry, the technical and organizational 
deficiencies are critically assessed. The latter include a low 
quality of polygraphic reproduction of compilations of maps and 
atlases, narrow specialization of cartographic enterprises, 
antiquated technology of many processes and a great lag in 
automation of time-consuming processes. These and other problems 
have been seriously aggravated by the political breakup of the 
former USSR because prior to 1992 60% of the map 
production 
needs of the Russian Federation was met in the former union 
republics, with some of the most modern facilities being 
constructed there. Only 23.7% of the map production 
capabilities remained inside Russia and these facilities lacked 
the equipment to produce a wide assortment of cartographic 
products. The drawing of new boundaries and the renaming of 
hundreds of places is meanwhile imposing an enormous demand for 
immediate revision of hundreds of maps. Some of the efforts to 
upgrade Russian cartographic enterprises are specifically 
mentioned. During the last several years even the existing map 
production plants have been underloaded due to the 
unavailability of map compilations which have been retained at 
enterprises outside Russia, not being returned despite 
agreements to do so. The new names of cities, the new boundaries 
of countries, all are in many cases not finalized, making for 
map production problems. The system by which plants pay for 
materials and the plants receive payment for their products has 
seriously complicated the process and all these factors have 
resulted in a severe drop in map production. Production has also 
been impeded by the shortage or low quality of paper, ink, 
offset plates and countless other materials. Against this 
discouraging background, the need for cartographic products is 
increasing rather than diminishing. An ambitious program is 
outlined, including production of a third edition of the famed 
Atlas of the World. If all goes well, the map production 
requirements should be fully met by the year 2000.

  [Abstract] Traditional mapping, data collection and 
processing must give way to computerization and far-reaching 
automation in order to meet the modern needs of the Russian 
economy. Geoinformation systems are a point of departure and 
this concept must be further developed; in particular, 
integrated regional geoinformation systems are needed. One 
aspect of related work is digital mapping. In 1992 a federal 
digital mapping program was organized in Russia which was 
collated with 28 ministries and departments. It is planned that 
in 1994 work will be completed on the preparation of digital 
maps at 1:100 000 for the whole of Russia and by 1994-1996 the 
same will be done at 1:200 000 for the most important regions. 
There is a real market for these maps. In the future it is 
planned that topographic maps at all scales will be converted to 
digital form. All this will facilitate automation of processes 
involved in the production of thematic and special maps. The 
same procedure will be applied in urban and land surveys. These 
are but the first steps, for example, in ensuring effective 
ecological monitoring and territorial inventorying of natural 
resources. The maintenance of regional databanks is a priority 
task, revision must be on a frequent basis and an 
ever-increasing number of procedures must be automated. The many 
related problems involved are discussed. The introduction of 
geoinformation systems must proceed on an accelerated basis, 
accompanied by an increase in the productivity of labor by a 
factor of 5-7. Digital cartographic information must be 
organized and managed by federal agencies with long-term funding 
and a uniform quality control must be introduced and 
implemented. The information system must be organized on the 
basis of a decentralized model which takes into account the 
participation of all interested organizations in use of this 
information and all users must have equal access.

  [Abstract] Computations were made of the penetration of an 
electrostatic field of seismic origin into the ionosphere for 
the case of a Gaussian distribution of the vertical electric 
field E[.sub]z[/] at the Earth's surface in the epicentral 
region of an impending earthquake. It was found that the 
effectiveness of field penetration at nighttime is far greater 
than during the daytime and is highly dependent on the extent of 
the region of localization of the vertical E[.sub]z[/] field. 
The strength of the electrostatic field at ionospheric altitudes 
has an appreciable value  0.3-0.7 mV/m only for large-scale 
seismic sources (a  100 km) under the condition that 
|E[.sub]z[/]| at the epicenter is  1000 V/m. A study of 
the effect of the electric field of a seismic source on the 
background ionosphere also was made. The greatest effect is 
observed in the middle part of the nighttime E layer where the 
Pedersen drift of ions is maximum. The nature of the ionospheric 
disturbance is determined by the direction of E[.sub]z[/]. 
With positive E[.sub]z[/] the electron concentration 
experiences an appreciable decrease over the region of 
localization of E[.sub]z[/] and when the E[.sub]z[/] field 
is directed downward there is an increase in N[.sub]e[/]. The 
degree of ionospheric disturbance is determined by the 
|E[.sub]z[/]| value at the epicenter and the extent of 
localization of the E[.sub]z[/] region. Figures 4; references

  [Abstract] Sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic, 
the severity of winters in the northern hemisphere, and the 
position of the intertropical convergence zone were analyzed to 
reveal trends. It was found, for example, that anomalously large 
shifts in the zone preceded anomalously warm winters in the 
U.S., and anomalously small shifts preceded cold winters. 
Low-frequency variability of sea surface temperature was 
determined from 34 years of data. Data filtering and 
normalization procedures are described. Low-frequency 
variability of the surface temperature of the North Atlantic 
demonstrates a significant spatial variability (up to 2C) 
which is probably linked with the variability of ocean 
circulation. Two types of remote links between the sea surface 
temperature and meridional motion of the intertropical 
convergence zone on interannual scales are found, and these 
appear to be related to quasi-stable atmospheric anomalies. The 
local interaction of ocean and atmosphere is probably dominant 
in the generation of quasi-stable sea surface temperature 
anomalies (as opposed to horizontal advective heat transfer by 
ocean currents), but this conclusion requires further 
confirmation. Figures 5; references 15: 5 Russian, 10 Western.

  [Abstract] The long-range prediction of ocean surface 
temperature anomalies (OSTA) in individual regions of the North 
Atlantic by use of the group analogues (GRAN) method is 
described. Such a prediction can be made in either a categorical 
or a probabilistic form. The ``Prognoz'' on-line databank of the 
Russian Hydrometeorological Center was used as the data source, 
especially the ROWS database containing information on the 
fields of mean monthly ocean surface temperature, surface 
pressure, 500-gPa geopotential surface and other parameters for 
a multiyear period. The basic principles for long-range 
prediction of OSTA as applicable to the GRAN method are 
outlined. A number of prognostic experiments were carried for 
testing the scheme. The purpose was an evaluation of the success 
of the prediction as a function of the makeup of the predictors. 
The various predictors used are discussed. It was found that the 
prognostic scheme gives the greatest gain in the case of quite 
large anomalies (in comparison with climatic and inertial 
predictions). The GRAN method also gives information which can 
be used in determining the processes involved in formation of 
temperature anomalies in the ocean. Predictions were prepared 
for 10 of the largest OSTA observed between 1957 and 1991. The 
results are given in a table. As a specific example, the results 
for one region for January 1983 also are given. The experiments 
clearly indicate that the group analogues scheme can be used 
successfully for long-range prediction of ocean water 
temperature and in some cases may be preferable to a categorical 
prediction. The method can be further improved by adjusting the 
predictors to the current process and varying them from 
prediction to prediction. Figures 2; references: 12 Russian.

  [Abstract] This article describes the capabilities of the 
Tsiklon-1 and Tsiklon-2-S measurement and computing complexes 
for aircraft used for meteorological research and cloud seeding. 
The equipment is installed on An-26 and YaK-40 aircraft. The 
types of equipment included in both systems are described and 
specifications are listed. In general, the equipment may be 
divided into navigation instruments, measurement devices, and 
recording and imaging devices. The AgI dispensers used for cloud 
seeding are described. The Tsiklon-1 system features a Doppler 
velocity measurement device, an inertial navigation system, and 
Orbita-20 and Orbita-701 on-board computers. The Tsiklon-2-S 
system features a gyrocompass system. The systems take 
meterological readings to determine the feasibility of cloud 
seeding. Results of seeding may also be tracked. The systems 
include an aircraft position monitoring device. This makes it 
possible to coordinate actions in multi-aircraft cloud seeding 
operations. The Tsiklon-2-S system is more sophisticated in that 
it uses an IBM AT PC and a satellite navigational system 
(TRANSPAK). Information is stored on diskette. Schematics of 
both systems are provided. Figures 2; tables 3; references 12:

  [Abstract] The results of simulative modeling of the 
influence of global warming on Russian agroclimatic resources 
and agricultural production are generalized. Scenarios of both 
models of the theory of climate and paleoclimatic 
reconstructions were used in the computations. The totality of 
the collected data indicates that the development of warming in 
scenarios of models of general circulation of the atmosphere 
would lead to a substantial aridization of the climate of Russia 
in which it would be reasonable to expect a decrease in 
agricultural productivity, but the development of a warming 
under the scenario of an interglacial optimum would result in a 
universal moistening of climate and a substantial increase in 
agricultural productivity. The following scenarios of change in 
important climatic factors by the year 2030 (in comparison with 
1990) are visualized: an increase in the concentration of carbon 
dioxide by 20% (CO[.sub]2[/] x 1.2); an increase in the 
background concentration of tropospheric ozone by 30% 
(O[.sub]3[/] x 1.3); a decrease in the content of soil 
organic matter by 20% (HUM x 0.8). It is demonstrated 
that the 
direct influence of an increase in the carbon dioxide gas 
concentration would be capable of offsetting the agricultural 
losses associated with a climatic change under the most 
unfavorable scenario. However, the negative impact of an 
increase in the content of other greenhouse gases, especially 
tropospheric ozone, and anthropogenic degradation of soils would 
make this possibility problematical. It is emphasized that with 
any variant of global warming there will be a need for radical 
restructuring of the entire agricultural management system. The 
simulative modeling of this biospheric system, however, may 
reveal safe and economically feasible ways to bring about such 
adaptation. References 17: 9 Russian, 8 Western.

  [Abstract] This article presents the results of 
comprehensive hydrological and acoustic studies of the structure 
of the Polar Front Zone in the central part of the Barents Sea 
during the third voyage of the Akademik Ioffe. Contact methods 
(CTD-photography, track measurements) and remote methods (IR 
radiometry, acoustic Doppler measurement of current speed, 
satellite sound backscattering studies) were used. The 
characteristics of fronts and associated phenomena (meanders and 
eddies) are studied. A significant correlation between 
hydrophysical and acoustic characteristics is detected. 
Surveying was done with 63 hydrological stations in a 
quasi-rectangular gird of nine meridional segments, each with 
seven stations 10 miles apart. The depth of the studied region 
was 200-350 m. Temperature and salinity gradients at the surface 
across the front reached 0.5C/km and 0.15 0/00. Data on 
individual mesoscale meanders are presented. Eddy regions 
displayed the most significant curving of isolines. Maximum 
sound scattering values, 10-20 dB, were found at 90-200 m. At 
50-90 m the contrast was 10-12 dB; below 200 m the contrast was 
no more than 4-6 dB. Analysis of echolocation measurements 
indicate the existence of mesoscale structures in the sound 
scattering field. Characteristic horizontal scales of regions 
with quasi-homogeneous scattering properties were 20-40 km, 
which matches the dimensions of dynamic formations. The 
transition regions between these zones have high gradients and 
the spatial configuration had the structural and dynamic 
features of a thermohaline field. Consequently, one can monitor 
mesoscale dynamic formations with echolocation equipment on a 
moving ship or on ocean bottom platforms. Figures 5; references 
13: 8 Russian, 5 Western.

  [Abstract] This article examines the fractal relief of the 
Earth's surface on the global scale. Based on one-degree grid 
elevation values, lengths of various topographic isolines were 
computed for seven grades of averaging. The perimetric method is 
used to determine that at the 100-2000 km scale the relief 
isolines are actually fractal lines with dimensions which 
substantially exceed unity (1.30 and above). Several additional 
considerations make it possible to expand these limits to 5 and 
20,000 km. The dimension of isolines depends on their 
hypsometric position. A simple model is proposed which 
illustrates the mechanism of this scale-dependent 
self-similarity of relief contours at different scales. Figures

  [Abstract] The alpha track method is used to determine the 
growth rate of nine iron-manganese concretions obtained in the 
southeast Pacific Ocean, on either side of the East Pacific 
Ridge at the Bellingshausen Sea. The tracks were recorded on 
cellulose nitrate. The growth rate varies from 1-16 mm/million 
years. For three concretions the growth rates are determined for 
the two opposite sides: for two of them, the concretion did not 
increase in one direction, and in the third, the growth rate 
differs by a factor of two. The rate of accumulation of the 
sediments on which the concretions lie was determined through 
radiocarbon dating and with the excess [.sup]230[/]Th method. 
The rate varied slightly, with an average of 0.4 mm/million 
years. The divergence in the age of concretions and the 
sediments on which they lie is associated with the activity of 
benthic fauna, which explains the inversion of radiocarbon date 
with depth. Figures 5; tables 4; references 23: 16 Russian, 7

  [Abstract] The towed probe chain examined here is a set of 
six CTD probes spaced 10-50 m apart in simultaneous operation on 
a tow line. One is the Mark III profiler, produced by NBIS, USA. 
Katran 04M probes made by the Akvastandard Scientific Production 
Association in Sevastopol are used at other levels for economic 
reasons. To obtain fine structure profiles and high-resolution 
cross sections on the route, scanning is used with an amplitude 
which provides a certain overlap of levels at a boat speed of 3 
m/s. Two scanning modes are available, one which minimizes 
overlap to increase horizontal resolution, and one which has a 
large overlap to increase the sounding depth. The Mark III probe 
is the fourth from the surface in the configuration displayed in 
the paper. The communication cable length may extend to 3 km 
without adverse effect. Illustrations show the configuration of 
the system and the trajectories of the probes in scanning mode. 
Data is recorded on a IBM PC/AT 386 clone. Profiles may be 
displayed in real time, but not printed (printing interferes 
with measurement). Examples of profiles obtained in Gulf Stream 
research are shown. The probes may be used together, separately, 
or in any combination. Figures 6; table 1; references 4: 2

  [Abstract] A study was made of the behavior of the relative 
variance of the turbulent fluctuations of photocurrent strength 
of CW and pulsed coherent lidars when using different schemes 
for the matching of wave fronts in optical heterodyning. It is 
shown that photocurrent strength fluctuations of a coherent 
lidar arise when there is a high spatial resolution of a 
single-mode heterodyne detector. The level of these fluctuations 
is proportional to the level of the turbulent fluctuations of 
the intensity of the sounding radiation. The proportionality 
factor is dependent on the angle of the detector field of view 
and it decreases with its increase. Applying these findings, the 
objective was the development of a coherent lidar with a high 
spatial resolution. This is possible only with single-mode 
detection. In comparison with methods for sounding the 
parameters of atmospheric turbulence based on measurement of 
intensity fluctuations of the scattered field, but using 
incoherent detection, a coherent lidar is more promising. 
Already with an entrance aperture of the receiving telescope R = 
2.8 cm the spatial resolution of the lidar already is adequate 
for registering the intensity of random photocurrent modulation 
by about 50% on a path 1.06 km. A further increase in the 
sounding range is possible by increasing entrance aperture size. 
Without a considerable decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio 
this is possible to R = 7.5 for coherent lidar systems which are 
oriented on surface paths and up to R = 50 cm when sounding is 
from space. These and other results obtained in the study can be 
used in solving problems arising in practical use of coherent 
lidar systems. Figures 2; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] The efficiency of use of a large bimorph 
adaptive mirror with compensation of large-scale low-frequency 
distortions is demonstrated. The theoretical approach to 
achieving efficient compensation of wave front distortions is 
outlined. Computer simulation of the correction of low-order 
optical aberrations with this mirror is described in detail. A 
comparative analysis is made of the efficiency of a large 
bimorph mirror and an adaptive mirror with discrete 
electromechanical drives. The results, revealing a high 
efficiency of such a mirror in the compensation of large-scale 
low-frequency wave front distortions, were obtained for a 
controlling mosaiced piezoelectric layer 1 mm thick (with a 
thickness of the mirror plate 78 mm). This relation of 
thicknesses evidently is not optimal and was selected only to 
demonstrate the possibilities of a large bimorph adaptive 
mirror. It is proposed that a multilayer mosaiced piezoelectric 
structure be used for reducing the controlling voltage (which in 
the experiments was about 300 V). A similar approach also is 
applicable in selecting the optimum thickness of the 
piezoelectric structure. A simple and effective method is 
proposed for forming a mosaiced bimorph structure. It involves 
using a multilayer structure with the least possible thickness 
of the piezoelectric film and optimized total thickness. In this 
case the controlling voltage can be reduced to several tens of 
volts and the individual piezoelements need not be in contact 
with one another. Figures 4; references: 2 Russian.

  [Abstract] Findings from projects undertaken under the 
program Global Environmental and Climatic Changes and articles 
in leading international and Russian journals published during 
1991-1992 are reviewed and two principal groups of problems are 
examined: geological factors in global changes in the 
environment and importance of catastrophes and periodicity of 
geological processes. The influence of endogenous processes 
caused by periodic mantle plumes on global changes is expressed 
through periodic bursts of catastrophic volcanism both in the 
oceans and in the island arcs, as well as periodic changes of 
movement of an ensemble of lithospheric plates and relief in the 
ocean and on the land, which in turn results in a change in the 
system of currents in the hydroatmosphere and climatic changes 
with periods of 30-34 million years. Shorter period changes are 
related to cosmic factors, especially Milankovitch cycles, 
although an interaction between endogenous and cosmic factors is 
reflected at all levels. Short-term changes in currents and the 
entry of CO[.sub]2[/] may be stimulated by endogenous 
processes, and vice versa, changes in the Earth's magnetic field 
associated with endogenous factors may be superposed on solar 
activity changes. During periods of magnetic field reversal 
solar plasma may be ``locked'' in the Earth's magnetic field. 
All such theoretical concepts examined in this study require 
further development, particularly the theory of mantle plumes 
and their interaction with asthenospheric flows. Figures 10; 
references: 53: 13 Russian, 40 Western.

  [Abstract] A new ecological issue is evaluation of the 
pollution caused by the landing of a rocket's first stage. The 
first stage contains fuel residue which contains a highly toxic 
compound, asymmetric dimethylhydrazine. Typically, the fuel 
explodes and burns on impact. In an explosion, the increase in 
temperature makes the substance more volatile; some fuel remains 
in the air, and is spread by the wind and precipitation. If 
there is no explosion, the fuel seeps into the ground. Oxidation 
products are harmful in either case. The physical and chemical 
properties of asymmetric dimethylhydrazine are examined. 
Research began in 1991 in Central Kazakhstan to study 
environmental anomalies caused by rocket fuel. Local 
high-contrast anomalies are due to direct contact, and more 
widespread low-contrast anomalies are associated with 
atmospheric transfer. Only 5% of soil samples revealed 
fuel 
residue concentrations above 0.02 mg/kg. The effects of various 
soil types, oxidation, and migration are examined. 
Concentrations of residue in vegetation were also studied. 
Content varied from 0.05-224.0 mg/kg, with the most common 
concentrations being 0.2-0.3 mg/kg. The maximum concentrations 
and largest percentage of contaminated samples were found at 
fall sites. Greater areas of vegetation than soil were 
contaminated, probably due to the combined effect of soil and 
atmospheric contamination. Root systems were studied to 
determine the method of contamination. It was found that plant 
type was also a factor. Seasonal differences in migration 
patterns, mainly due to temperature and evaporation, are 
explained. Figures 2; tables 2; references 11: 9 Russian, 2

  [Abstract] At the PNIIIS experience has long been 
accumulated on carrying out many-sided 
(geological-geomorphological, geophysical and geodetic) research 
for detecting and predicting dangerous tectonic displacements at 
construction sites. Specifically, such materials were collected 
for the site of the South Ural nuclear power plant (NPP). The 
scope of this research program and the procedures used in the 
collection of pertinent materials are described in detail. The 
research program revealed that the Ural plant, which is under 
construction, is located in an area with favorable geological 
conditions and there are no contraindications with respect to 
recent tectonic movements against continuing construction 
because its site is situated within the limits of a unified 
morphostructural block. Moreover, the fault structures 
intersecting this construction site and the foundations beneath 
the reactors have not been rejuvenated during about the last 30 
million years by local ruptures and zones of increased 
fracturing. The research program carried for this site is 
particularly important because it can serve as a model for other 
NPP sites where dangerous conditions may exist which should be 
detected before construction is initiated. It represents a 
considerable improvement over previous engineering programs used 
during study of NPP construction sites. Figures 6; references

  [Abstract] Data are given on multiyear observations of 
changes in hydrometeorological characteristics in the Yenisey 
basin resulting from the global warming of climate in the 
1980's. Estimates are given of the possible changes which may 
occur with an increase in global temperature by 1-2 and 
3-4C. Predictions made at the State Hydrological Institute 
on the basis of paleoclimatic reconstructions of warm epochs of 
the past are used as climatic scenarios of the future. A model 
with a monthly computation time interval was used for conversion 
from the climatic parameters to hydrological characteristics. 
The increase in temperature and precipitation in the Yenisey 
basin which began in 1975 indirectly confirms the conclusion 
that there has been a global warming of climate. At the present 
time the rate of increase in temperature and precipitation in 
this region exceeds the computed values for the Earth. However, 
the increase in the mean annual precipitation has not resulted 
in a change in annual and seasonal runoff. Under all scenarios 
of change in the climatic situation runoff in the Yenisey basin 
will substantially increase. With a climatic warming there will 
be a seasonal redistribution of runoff and the duration of 
winter will substantially decrease. The study was made without 
allowance for the influence of permafrost on the hydrological 
regime of rivers in the Yenisey basin under conditions of a 
climatic warming, which would be especially significant with a 
temperature increase &gt;  2-3C. Figures 4; references 9: 7

  [Abstract] The need for and desirability of constructing 
deep underground repositories in rock salt formations for the 
storage of solid and cast-off toxic and radioactive industrial 
wastes is demonstrated. Foreign experience along these lines is 
discussed. The principal requirements on rock salt formations, 
regarded as potential sites for constructing cavernous 
repositories, are examined and the technological procedures for 
preparing such repositories are outlined. Different variants are 
evaluated, but in every case the excavation results in recovery 
of great volumes of valuable mineral raw material useful in the 
production of various kinds of soda, paper, artificial rubber 
and other products. The need for developing a special 
engineering geology classification of salt formations is 
validated. A table lists the principal regions in Russia which 
could be considered for constructing such salt formation 
repositories. The selection criteria show that it would be most 
effective to use salt formations of the stratum type, as well as 
those characterized by a relatively simple internal structure. 
In this selection process it is particularly necessary to 
ascertain the spatial position of intercalations of insoluble 
rocks and also easily soluble (potassic, magnesian salts) 
formations. Additional factors must be taken into account when 
considering complex structures of the salt dome type. References

  [Abstract] An analysis was conducted on the factors 
affecting retention and exclusion of precursors of recombinant 
human insulin on size-exclusion HPLC. The study involved 
chromatography of 6-17 kD insulin precursor peptides on TSK G 
300 SW columns, using 0.1 M sodium phosphate elution buffers, pH 
7.0, with and without 0.2 M NaCl or 0.2 M sodium sulfate. The 
resultant data demonstrated that K[.sub]d[/] increased with 
an increasing ionic strength, with the most stable separations 
evident at an ionic strength range of 0.1 to 0.4. Addition of 
low concentrations (0.01-0.05%) of 0.1 M SDS led to a 
sharp 
reduction in K[.sub]d[/], with higher concentrations 
(0.05-0.2%) having little further effect. Efficient 
separation 
was also obtained with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride because of 
the greater differences between points corresponding to the 
different K[.sub]d[/] values of the proteins--including 
poorly soluble linear and folded proinsulin. Accordingly, 
size-exclusion HPLC was shown to lend itself to analytical 
determinations at all stages of recombinant insulin production.

  [Abstract] Two-dimensional NMR ROESY spectroscopy was 
employed in assessing the configuration about the P atom of 16 
pairs of deoxydinucleoside methyl phosphonates with the general 
formula [MeO)[.sub]2[/]Tr]Np-(CH[.sub]3[/])N'(Ac) and the 
unnatural -O-P(CH[.sub]3[/])(O)-O- internucleoside bond. In 
the formula, N- and N' indicate the base protected 
dinucleosides. Cross-relaxation data on interaction of 
P-CH[.sub]3[/] protons with the 3'-end nucleoside revealed 
differences only in the case of H(3')- and H(4')-protons of 
pyrimidine nucleosides. These interactions were more pronounced 
in the case of the S[.sub]p[/] isomers. Accordingly, the 
spectral variations between the diasteroisomers were due to 
conformational differences predicated on the nature of the 
heterocyclic bases in the dimers. Figures 3; tables 3; 
references 17: 2 Russian, 15 Western.

  [Abstract] Technical details are presented on liquid- and 
solid-phase syntheses of oligonucleotide dithioates as potential 
antivirals and antineoplastics. Liquid-phase triester approach 
yielded dimers and tetramers in millimolar quantities and 
octamers at the 0.1 mmolar level. Solid-phase approach on 
polyethelene glycol support with thioamidite reagent provided 
the octanucleotide dithioates (T[.sub]8[/](S[.sub]2[/]) 
and C[.sub]7[/]T(S[.sub]2[/]) in yields of 0.02 and 0.12 
millimoles, respectively. The products of solid-phase synthesis 
were purified by a novel method including cleavage of the 
protected oligonucleotides from the polymeric carrier, 
adsorption chromatography on silica gel, complete removal of 
protective groups and, finally, reverse-phase chromatography on 
silica gel C[.sub]18[/]. Figures 3; references 76 (Western).

  [Abstract] Radionuclide monitoring studies conducted in 
1991 and 1992 on Barents Sea and adjacent shoreline showed that 
Cs-137 levels ranged from essentially zero to 1440 Bq/kg of 
benthic sample collected from different locations. Measurements 
on mossess and lichens from adjacent shores revealed levels of 
contamination with Cs-137 approaching 530 Bq/g at some 
locations. These findings indicate that the Barents Sea region 
has sustained an increase in the level of radionuclide 
contamination over the past four decades. The contaminating 
radionuclides derived from nuclear weapons testing in the 
fifties and sixties, activities of Western radiochemical plants, 
as well as the the Chernobyl accident. References 6: 2 Russian,

  [Abstract] Only 7-10% of the DNA in the human genome 
represents structural genes, regulatory sequences, origins of 
replication, sequences bound to the nuclear matrix and 
P-repeats. A theory is proposed that this DNA be regarded as 
basic genome of the eukaryotic cells. The reason for the excess 
DNA present in the eukaryotic genome remains enigmatic, but one 
answer may be that it provides a critical chromatin mass 
necessary to maintain the structural organization and 
macromolecular framework for successful mitosis or meiosis. 
Studies on the human genome could be considerable facilitated 
and reduced in cost if such efforts were to be solely directed 
at the basic genome, excluding the non-basic genome from the 
sequencing efforts. References 14: 4 Russian, 10 Western.

  [Abstract] Determining the plasmid spectra of plague 
pathogen strains is an important means of increasing the 
effectiveness of epidemiological control systems for plague. The 
plasmid spectra of 122 strains of Yersinia pestis 
were isolated in Mongolia from patients, wild mammals, and 
arthropods. The populations of three plasmidovars of Y. 
pestis were circulating in the natural foci of plague in 
Mongolia. Samples were tested for Ca[.sup]2+[/] growth 
dependence at 37C. Of the three plasmidovars, the first 
harbors three plasmids with mol masses 6, 47, 65 Md. The second 
and third contain plasmids with mol masses 6, 16, 47, 65 Md and 
8, 47, and 75-80 Md. It is hoped that this work will help solve 
the problem of intraspecific differentiation of the plague 
microbe and will uncover the mechanism for the formation of 
epidemically significant populations of Y. pestis and 
determine their clonal structuring. Figures 2; references 13: 7

  [Abstract] The ICO-84 and ICO-103 monoclonal antibodies 
(Mab) (developed at the Laboratory of Clinical Radioimmunology 
of the ONTs [expansion not given] of the Russian Academy of 
Medical Sciences) were studied to determine their reactivity 
spectrum with tumors of various histogenesis, to compare results 
of histological and cytological studies, and to evaluate the 
possibility of using these antibodies in oncocytology to label 
malignant cells. Epithelial and nonepithelial tumors were used 
to study Mab reactivity. Detailed information on tissue types 
and reactivity is given in the table. Sample handling is 
described in detail. Mab ICO-84 exhibited a broad spectrum of 
interaction with human malignant neoplasm cells. The strongest 
reactions were noted for colorectal carcinoma, lung, breast, 
stomach and esophageal cancers. Mab ICO-103 also reacted to a 
wide range of epithelial tumors. Most intense reactions were 
noted for breast, uterine, and thyroid tumors. Less frequent but 
equally intense reactions were found for ovarian, lung, and 
kidney tumors. Reaction types are categorized. Immunochemical 
reactivity in cytological specimens agrees well with findings 
for histological sections. Mabs ICO-103 and ICO-84 may be used 
to mark epithelial tumors and to determine the epithelial nature 
of malignant cells. They may also be used with other antibodies 
for differential diagnosis of metastatic poorly differentiated 
tumors and lymphoproliferative diseases. Figures 4; table 1;

  [Abstract] A relatively simple ``vacuum approximation'' 
method of conformational analysis and a method for estimating 
the free energy of molecular transfer from the gaseous (organic) 
to the aqueous phase were described and proposed as alternatives 
to the traditional approach to simulating biopolymer molecular 
structure. The rational for the simplified approach was based on 
two equations derived from the thermodynamic cycles employed to 
quantitatively express molecular structures and processes. These 
equations can be used to estimate the free energies of these 
processes in water. The simplified approach was used to simulate 
the structure of molecules and molecular associations in the 
aqueous phase, to simulate simple molecular systems and quantify 
their hydrophobic interaction, and to simulate the structure of 
hydrocarbon polymers and glycine and alanine oligopeptides in 
the organic and aqueous phases. It was found that a polymer 
molecule bends back under itself in water, forming a compact 
structure and reducing the total molecular surface, leaving the 
accessible surfaces of the polar groups located in the linear 
sections unchanged while increasing the accessible surfaces of 
the groups located where the molecule bends. This gives the 
molecule an advantage by minimizing hydrophobic interaction and 
by maximizing the hydration of the polar groups. Such behavior 
is typical for any polymer, thus optimizing their ability to 
interact with surrounding water molecules. This pattern is also 
valid for peptides and proteins. The behavior of the glycine and 
alanine peptides was found to be similar to one another in many 
ways, with one notable exception involving a substantially lower 
free energy contribution for the C7eq and _a_ 
conformers in the alanine, and consistent with existing 
experimental data. Figures 11, tables 22; references 65: 14

  [Abstract] Specially synthesized oligonucleotides were used 
to detect and study SLS polynucleotide chain folding, the 
theoretical model of which was constructed to explain the 
unusual sensitivity of short tandem base repetition under 
superhelical stress to single-strand specific nuclease. A 
19-unit oligonucleotide capable of forming a pseudogene was 
chemically modified under conditions that preserved the 
secondary structure in order to clarify the state of the timines 
and adenines. The modification sites were then split in hot 
piperidine. To confirm the physical existence of SLS, a special 
55-unit oligonucleotide was designed and synthesized. The 
results of chemical modification at the single nucleotide 
resolution level together with localization of the cleavage 
sites with S1 nuclease revealed that one and the same base pairs 
exhibited markedly different levels of sensitivity to the 
modifier depending on their sequence location, and that those 
base pairs that were strongly modified were already known to be 
in a single-strand state or at the end of the helix. Those found 
in the helical backbone or in the hypothesized interloop 
mini-helix, were weakly modified, if at all. These data strongly 
support the model of a highly symmetrical slipped-loop structure 
with a stabilized interloop helix. To be even more sure, the 
cleavage representation of the same oligonucleotide with the S1 
nuclease was studied. Three compact regions of intensive 
cleavage were clearly visible: the nucleotides of the end loop 
and the unpaired nucleotides of both of the loops forming the 
mini-helix. A GenBank search of nucleotide sequences turned up a 
low estimate of 518 sites capable of SLS generation. Figures 10; 
references 15: 2 Russian, 13 Western.

  [Abstract] The practical difficulties inherent in using 
hybridization with an oligonucleotide matrix (SHOM), a new DNA 
sequencing method developed by the authors three years ago, have 
been overcome by a procedure that obviates the problems 
associated with the different stabilities of the AT- and GC-rich 
hybrids. First, a 10-30-m layer of 8% cross-linked 
polyacrylamide gel is applied to a glass plate. The 
oligonucleotide is then immobilized throughout the entire cell, 
which is a 50 to 1000-m gel square halved by a large divider 
of hydrophobized glass. By making the capacity of the carrier 
very large, the oligonucleotide concentration amounts to 1 to 90 
m. Finally, the quantity of DNA fragment is selected so that 
1/100 of the binding sites are occupied during complete 
hybridization. It was found that the effect of varying any 
parameter on the ``washing-out'' temperature, Tw, 
depended on the enthalpy of the process. An overall increase in 
the stability of all the oligonucleotide matrix duplexes 
inevitably ``narrowed'' the Tw range, which could 
compromise the sensitivity of the method. Tw was 
insignificantly affected by _D_T between 5 and 20C. An 
increase in washing-out time results in a higher Tw. 
Tw also depends on oligonucleotide concentration; 
generally, the concentration of oligonucleotides that form less 
stable duplexes should be increased to a greater degree than 
those forming less stable duplexes. Finally, lengthening the DNA 
fragment results in a slight increase in Tw. This 
knowledge makes it possible to calculate Tw with 
sufficient accuracy. This study was commissioned by the Russian 
National HUMAN GENOME Program. Figures 2, tables 4; references 
9: 2 Russian, 7 Western.

  [Editorial Report] The Medical Academy imeni Sechenova 
claims to have developed a method for obtaining vaccines that 
significantly exceed the international standard for purity. The 
Moscow physicians' newspaper MEDITSINA SEGODNYA (No. 4 1994) 
reports that the new purification method will enable Russia to 
meet its domestic demand for vaccines and also to sell vaccines 
abroad. 
  The method uses novel filters developed by the medical 
biotechnology laboratory of the Sechenova Academy in 
collaboration with the Khimvolokno Scientific Product ion 
Association. The new filters consist of hollow synthetic fibers 
used in spacecraft filters, which remove impurities in several 
stages until the preparation is molecularly uniform. According 
to the newspaper, the purity of vaccines made with the filters 
is 1900 to 2500 antigen units, higher than the World Health 
Organization standard of 1500 antigen units. Purification 
equipment using the filters can process 40 liters of 
concentrated preparation in three hours, as compared to 1 liter 
per hour using conventional membrane disk filters. The 
Bioavtomatika Scientific Research Center in Nizhegorod makes the 
purification equipment. 
  MEDITSINA SEGODNYA reported that the Sechenova Academy has 
already used the new technology to create an extremely pure 
diphtheria anatoxin, soon to be mass produced by Biomed in 
Moscow. In collaboration with the Moscow Chemical Technology 
Institute imeni M. V. Lomonosov, Sechenova has also developed a 
better test for evaluating immunity to diphtheria. The test kit 
uses colored latex coated with purified anatoxin as an immunity 
indicator. It has a two-year storage life when refrigerated, 
compared to two to three months for erythrocyte-based tests. 
The test can be used for rapid assessment of individual or 
group immunity to determine if vaccination is necessary and safe 
(Moscow MEDITSINA SEGODNYA No. 4 94).

  [Editorial report] Viturid, a powerful new immuno-stimulant 
claimed to be effective against both AIDS and cancer, has won 
the support of Russian Federation Health Minister Eduard 
Nechayev. Despite sponsorship offered by the U.S. government 
and a San Francisco hospital, the developer, Tamara Vorobyeva, 
has turned to the Russian Federation government for assistance 
in testing and perfecting the pharmaceutical, claimed to be 
worth ``billions of dollars.'' A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (6 Jan 94) 
article details Vorobyeva's resourcefulness and persistence in 
pursuing development of the drug despite her country's political 
and economic turmoil. 
  Said to be ten times more effective than standard U.S. and 
Soviet therapies, Viturid reportedly guarantees a complete cure 
for second-stage and even some third-stage cancers. Patients 
with fourth-stage osteogenic sarcoma and sarcoma of the lungs 
were among those reported cured (Moscow NOVOYE VREMYA No 4 Feb 
94). In clinical tests, tumors treated with Viturid became 
benign and then completely regressed. Viturid is also claimed 
to be effective against the human immunodeficiency virus before 
immunodeficiency occurs (Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA 6 Jan 94). 
It is also claimed to be ``extremely effective'' against a wide 
range of diseases, including psoriasis, ulcers, herpes, 
arthritis and salmonellosis (Moscow NOVOYE VREMYA No. 4 Feb 94). 
Press reports do not give the pharmaceutical's composition, but 
note that it possesses very low toxicity. Ninety percent of 
its toxic elements are excreted within 6 hours of administration. 
  An analytical chemist, Vorobyeva based Viturid on an old 
therapeutic recipe which she used to cure herself of stage III 
cancer. In February 1985 she applied for a patent for ``a 
treatment for cancer and AIDS.'' In July 1989 she received the 
state patent commission's certification that her invention was 
scientifically valid. In June 1990, Chairman Lepakhin of the 
All-Union Pharmaceutical Committee requested 50,000 rubles from 
Academy of Medical Sciences President Pokrovskiy to begin 
clinical testing of Viturid in Moscow. But deteriorating 
economic conditions then stalled progress for a year. 
  Thanks to the personal intervention of Ukrainian Health 
Minister Boris Spizhenko, clinical trials began in March 1991 at 
the Kiev Scientific Research Institute of Pharmacology and 
Toxicology. Successful results were announced in April 1991. A 
ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA article (25 Feb 92) reporting these results 
enthusiastically called on the Russian and Ukrainian Health 
Ministers to authorize production of the drug. To permit 
Vorobyeva to earn capital for further research, the Ukrainian 
Health Ministry approved Viturid for therapeutic use in less 
than the normal time. 
  The collapse of the Soviet Union forced Vorobyeva to return 
to Russia, where her patent claim had been filed, to try again 
to solicit support from the government. On 18 February 1992, 
Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokin told the Health Ministry 
and the Academy of Medical Sciences to examine and support 
Vorobyeva's proposal for further research. The Academy promised 
help from the Moscow Scientific Research Institute for Oncology 
imeni Gertsen, on the condition that the inventor find the 
necessary capital, said to be millions of rubles. 
  In September 1992, Vorobyeva applied for a U.S. patent. 
According to press reports, the U.S. government quickly ``took 
her patent applications under its wing'' and granted her a three 
year work permit. A San Francisco hospital offered to conduct 
clinical tests in exchange for the right to use the 
pharmaceutical. Vorobyeva found this condition unacceptable and 
formed her own company in the United States, while continuing to 
solicit aid in Russia. 
  This time Vorobyeva may have found the support she needs. 
In 27 July 1993, she received four Russian patents for her 
pharmaceutical and for her treatment method. A fifth patent 
registering Viturid as an immunomodulator followed on 8 December 
1993 (Moscow NOVOYE VREMYA No. 4 Feb 94). Russian Health 
Minister Eduard Nechayev tasked his subordinates to confirm 
preliminary tests on Viturid by January 1994. Unable to support 
the inventor financially, Nechayev wants to commence use of 
Viturid for some diseases in order to finance full testing of 
all its possible uses. Clinical tests of Viturid by the Karelian 
Ministry of Health started in 0ctober 1992. The Russian Health 
Ministry is reportedly now preparing for industrial production 
of the new pharmaceutical (Moscow NOVOYE VREMYA No. 4 Feb 94).

  [Abstract] Current screening for HIV infection looks for 
viral protein antibodies in the blood. Primary antigenemia, 
however, is known to precede seroconversion, a fact that makes 
the creation of test systems for determining HIV antigens 
desirable as a possible early diagnostic tool. Since monoclonal 
antibodies to viral proteins have high specificity and 
homogenicity, they are ideally suited just such test systems. 
The researchers here produced a total of 152 hybridomas whose 
monoclonal antibodies react in EIA with 
_b_-galactosidase-grafted recombinant proteins that are 
products 
of HIV-1 and HIV-2 gag and env genes. The list of hybridomas was 
narrowed down to 10 whose antibodies interact with a recombinant 
HIV antigen only. Three clones -- 24/13, 24/16, and 24/26 -- 
produced antibodies to the HIV-1 gag gene and reacted with 
natural viral proteins. The antibodies of 24/16 and 24/46 
interacted with p24 only, whereas 24/13 interacted with p55 and 
seven polypeptides that were not fully processed products of the 
HIV-1 gag gene. In EIA, 24/46 interacted with both the HIV-1 
antigen and the HIV-2 antigen. The three clones have different 
protein-binding sites. Two clones -- 41/23 and 41/128 -- 
produced antibodies to the protein product of the HIV-1 env 
gene. Five hybridomas -- 38/3, 38/8, 38/12, 38/15, and 38/17 -- 
produced antibodies to the HIV-2 env gene. Figures 2, references 
11 (Western).

  [Abstract] Intravenous drug users represent a potential 
reservoir for HIV. The researchers here performed a computer 
study of monthly reports from AIDS-prevention centers, daily 
reports of HIV infection, and reports of epidemiological 
investigations filed in the Russian Center for Controlling AIDS 
to identify a correlation between HIV infection and drug use. 
They found that, as of 1 November 1992, a total of 588 
individuals had been diagnosed as having HIV, and eight of those 
individuals had had casual sex with drug users. A poll of 86 
intravenous drug users indicated that most of them (upwards of 
90 percent) shared unsterilized needles. None of those polled 
had shared needles with foreigners, although 13-18 percent had 
shared needles with prostitutes. Users of so-called pervitin 
accounted for the highest percentage of drug users who had sex 
immediately after intravenous injection of the drug. Most of 
those polled did not have a steady sex partner, did not use 
condoms, and had sex with prostitutes. Only 6 percent had had 
sex with foreigners. The pervitin users appear to be at greatest 
risk among the drug users for spread of HIV. References 6

  [Abstract] It has been shown that Macaca rhesus monkeys 
injected with the Mozambique virus, which is closely related to 
the Lassa virus in terms of antigens, are protected against 
subsequent infection with a virulent strain of the Lassa virus. 
Owing to the fact that Mozambique virus is not pathogenic to man 
or monkeys, some researchers feel that Mozambique virus is a 
candidate for use in the preparation of a live vaccine designed 
to prevent Lassa fever. Before that can be done, however, 
convincing evidence must be produced to the effect that the 
virus is definitely not pathogenic to man, and it must be 
certain that the virus would not persist in the human body. Data 
published in the late 1980s reported testing of a recombinant 
Lassa vaccine on guinea pigs and monkeys, all of whom survived a 
lethal dose of Lassa virus after being vaccinated with the 
recombinant vaccine. Protection was not total, however, as they 
developed short-term fever and virusemia. That prompted the 
researchers here to study an inactivated vaccine against Lassa 
fever. The vaccine they tested protected Papio hamadryas monkeys 
against intramuscular infection of Lassa virus after both two 
immunizations and one immunization in doses of 1.1-2.1 mg and 
0.5-1.1 mg. The percentage of those protected dropped to 50 
percent when infection was via the aerogenic route and 
immunization was performed only once, in a dose of 1.1 mg. The 
protective effect was observed against the backdrop of an 
absence of specific virus-neutralizing antibodies. References

  [Abstract] Enzyme immunoassay is the preferred test for 
diagnosing viral and bacterial infections among animals for a 
number of reasons, among them its simplicity and quickness of 
execution, its high level of sensitivity, the accessibility and 
stability of the reagents used. The researchers here developed a 
field technique that will analyze a serum sample for the 
presence of antigens or their antibodies and provide on-site 
results. Test results are produced within 30-40 minutes (as 
opposed to the best current time of 3-4 hours), without the need 
for complex instrumentation. References 11 (Russian).

  [Editorial report] Russian media have reported various 
initiatives to overcome what has been characterized as a 
continuing demographic crisis. In an article published in the 
Minis try of Health periodical VRACH [Physician], Candidate of 
Medical Sciences V. Brutman, who is a member of the 
administration of Independent Association of Pediatric 
Psychiatrists and Psychologists, reported that a group of 
physicians, psychologists, legal scholars and sociologists has 
proposed a program for women deemed likely to obtain abortions 
or to reject their newborns (Sep 93). A key element of the 
draft program ``Prevention of Early Rejection of Motherhood'' is 
a crisis center, which would identify and counsel pregnant women 
at risk of rejecting their infants. The crisis center would 
maintain a hot line and a crisis team, which would visit 
maternity hospitals to intervene in cases where rejection seems 
iUinent. Women with high-risk social indicators would be 
hospitalized at maternity homes to receive ``intensive 
assistance in continuing their pregnancies.'' After providing 
therapy to restore normal parent-child relations, a live-in 
``rehabilitation center'' would keep its graduates under 
observation for several years. The measures are intended to 
support women without coercion. 
  More recently, a different approach to demographic problems 
was suggested by biologist Evgeniy Tsenov in an article on the 
first page of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI (26 Feb 1994). Tsvenov, who 
blames the country's demographic decline on its acute 
environmental problems, excessive consumption of inferior 
quality alcohol and abortions, opposes the manufacture of 
contraceptives in Russia.

  [Editorial Report] Admitting that starvation was a`` real 
threat'' in Moscow last winter, the Russian Federation 
government recently loaned Moscow 550 billion rubles to purchase 
food (Moscow INTERFAX 8 Feb 94). Moscow was not the only city to 
suffer from inadequate nutrition, which has become a problem 
throughout the vast Russian republic. 
  High prices and low wages have made nutritional deficiency 
commonplace throughout Russia. In September 1993, families 
spent 60 percent of their income on food, and retirees, 85 
percent (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1994). But today because of 
inflation, 77 percent of workers earn less than is required for 
basic subsistence (Moscow TRUD 3 Feb 1994, Moscow IZVESTIYA 5 
Feb 1994). Unemployment, strikes and delayed wage payments have 
further compromised the population's ability to purchase food 
(Moscow INTERFAX 22 Feb 94, TRUD 19 Feb 94). 
  Russians coped by changing the composition of their diets. 
Consumption of meat, butter, vegetables and fruit dropped 75 
percent, while that of potatoes and bread products increased 
(Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1994). The fat content of Moscow waste 
water declined sharply to wartime levels, a finding said to 
indicate poor nutrition (Moscow TRUD 3 Feb 1994). 
  Widespread nutritional deficiencies resulted (Moscow TRUD 3 
Feb 1994). The Russian diet is now 25 percent deficient in 
protein, 50 percent deficient in vitamin C and 20-30 percent 
deficient in A and B vitamins (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 1993). It 
also lacks sufficient carbohydrates. Sixty percent of children 
responding to a republic-wide poll said they usually do not get 
enough to eat (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). Thirteen percent of low-income 
Russians suffer from true malnutrition (Moscow IZVESTIYA 5 Feb 
1994), while borderline malnutrition affects a third of the 
total population (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 94). 
  Women, children and the elderly seem to be particularly 
vulnerable. Nutritional deficiencies are reputed to have caused 
a sharp rise in 
maternal deaths in 1991-1993 (Moscow TRUD 24 Sep 93). Only one 
child in four enjoys normal health, and half of young children 
are thinner than normal. Kurgan Oblast children have reportedly 
fainted from hunger (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). TRUD cites several 
starvation deaths and suicides apparently motivated by 
malnutrition. The Krasnodar emergency service recently found 
the corpse 
of a starvation victim on the street. The Moscow Main Medical 
Administration recorded two starvation deaths in Moscow in 1993, 
a tramp and an elderly woman. Tragically, a Moscow mother 
unable to feed her son suffocated him and attempted suicide. 
Autopsies of four elderly suicides in St. Petersburg detected 
no trace of food in their stomachs (TRUD 3 Feb 1994). 
  Unaffordability of food, rather than lack of it, may be the 
key to thepresent crisis. Although food production declined in 
1993 (Moscow T0RGOVAYA GAZETA 18 Jan 94), agricultural products 
went unsold (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). Deputy Prime 
Minister Zaveryukha acknowledged that his country's 6-8 million 
ton grain surplus resulted from reduced consumer demand (Moscow 
INTERFAX 16 Mar 94). According to Deputy Agriculture Minister 
Vladimir Shcherback, declining consumption was the reason farms 
reduced herds of livestock and left much of the potato crop 
unharvested (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). 
  Next year promises to bring smaller crops and higher food 
prices. Newtariffs on food imports may inflate food prices 
(Moscow INTERFAX 16 Mar94). Shcherbak predicted that credit 
costs will reduce the acreage sown and raise the price of 
agricultural products (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 6 Jan 94). 
These factors suggest that both food prices and malnutrition 
will continue to rise in 1994.

  [Editorial Report] The Odessa periodical 
OFTALMOLOGICHESKIY ZHURNAL contains five articles on ophthalmic 
pathologies caused by exposure to ionizing radiation released 
during the Chernobyl accident. Studies of individuals who 
either participated in post-accident clean-up or reside in the 
contaminated zone indicate that they are at increased risk of a 
variety of eye disorders, including cataracts. 
  Several of the reports indicate that radiation may be 
initiating a variety of ophthalmic problems in children. In 
52.1 percent of 6896 children who live in the Chernobyl 
radiation contamination zone, researchers L. A. Sukhina, A. F. 
Smirnova, S. V. Chubar and Ali Zorkot found ophthalmic disorders 
such as refractive anomalies, chronic blepharoconjunctivitis, 
pigmented neoplasms of the mucosa, opacification of the lens, 
and edema of the optic nerve and retina. In many cases 
pathologies were initially detected after radiation exposure and 
may have been caused by it. The researchers found a much higher 
incidence of pathologies than were detected in a 1985 study of 
Ukrainian children, in which 6.1 percent had ophthalmic 
disorders. 
  These findings about children are supported by animal 
studies. Rats chronically exposed to increased levels of 
ionizing radiation from the Chernobyl accident experienced 
dystrophic, adaptive and proliferative changes in the retina, 
concluded N. Ye. Dumbrova and N. I. Nesteruk. Young rats 
brought into the contaminated zone suffered greater changes than 
rats that had always lived in the zone. The cytoplasmic 
structures of the photoreceptor were the earliest cells affected 
and the most susceptible to damage. The researchers predict 
that individuals exposed to radiation will experience slowly or 
rapidly progressing dystrophic processes in the retina or 
exacerbation of existing pathologies. Tn a study conducted on 
newborn rats, N. N. Bushuyeva and N. Ye. Dumbrova found that 
radiation of the thymus gland causes destructive changes in the 
connective tissue of the sclera that may initiate the 
development of myopia or promote its progression. The authors 
propose long-term mass screening of children and adolescents in 
high radiation zones. 
  Radiation from Chernobyl may also be causing premature aging 
of the eyes. A study of senile cataracts in Tvano-Frankovsk 
District has revealed a 35 percent increase during 1988-1993. 
M. T. Shkromida, M. A. Mosyak, R.V. Boychuk, and T. N. Senyuk 
found cataracts to be most frequent (9.1-9.8 per 10,000 
population) in zones with the highest radioactivity levels. A 
higher incidence was found in the Subcarpathian and Dniester 
regions (8.3-9.5 patients per 10,000 population) than in the 
Carpathian region (3.1-4.3 patients per 10,000). Cataracts 
developed in younger individuals in the Dniester region than in 
Carpathia. 
  Even low, legally permitted doses of ionizing radiation can 
lead to senile cataracts and premature aging of the lens, 
concluded B. Sh. Lazaretnik, Yu. V. Bakbardin and A. V. 
Grebennik after a comparative study of Chernobyl clean-up 
participants, contaminated zone residents, and control groups. 
They also found that these ophthalmic changes can serve as an 
indicator of overall accelerated senescence caused by radiation 
exposure and manifested as chronic degeneration and inflammation 
of the upper respiratory tract, and neurasthenia. This report 
notes that other radiation-induced eye disorders identified in 
previous studies of Chernobyl victims include vascular changes, 
alterations in the ocular adnexa, and optic nerve pathologies. 
These reports indicate that ophthalmic problems caused by 
Chernobyl will be a growing problem for Ukraine. Most of the 
articles propose additional research, as well as long-term 
screening, prophylaxis and treatment of populations in zones 
with increased radiation levels.

  [Editorial Report] Russian experts are trying to determine 
the cause of mysterious mass mushroom poisonings which occurred 
in Voronezh Oblast in 1992, according to a report in the Russian 
public health journal, ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII 
(Dec 93). A group of scientists from the Voronezh Oblast State 
Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate, the Kurchatov 
Institute, and the Scientific Research Institute for Preventive 
Toxicology and Disinfection propose funding the eight-million 
ruble program from Voronezh Oblast funds earmarked for ecology 
purposes. 
  Tn 1992, 335 Voronezh residents were poisoned and 24 died 
(Moscow ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII Dec 93). The 
outbreak strained local toxicological centers and prompted 
oblast authorities to prohibit the sale and processing of 
mushrooms (Moscow MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA 12 Aug 92). 
  Extensive studies by prominent institutes failed to identify 
the substance responsible for the poisonings, the journal said. 
Possible sources of contamination considered were 
radioactivity, heavy metals, agricultural chemicals, 
microorganism toxins, and toxins created during cooking. 
Researchers also thought that warm weather may have altered the 
appearance of poisonous mushrooms so that they resembled edible 
species. Studies were conducted at the Volgograd Scientific 
Research Institute of Toxicology, Occupational Pathology and 
Medical Prevention of Chemical Poisoning, the Komarov Institute 
of Botany in St. Petersburg, the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, 
the Voronezh Oblast Epidemiology Center, and the Institute of 
Toxicology in Yekaterinburg. 
  Previous press accounts reported that animal tests detected 
``strong toxins'' in the Voronezh mushrooms (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7 
Aug 92, Moscow Russian Television Network 12 Sep 92). The 
medical newspaper MEDTTSTNSKAYA GAZETA (Moscow 12 Aug 92), 
however, noted that tests had failed to find either toxic 
substances or heavy metal salts in the fungi. MEDTTSTNSKAYA 
GAZETA also noted speculation that edible mushrooms had mutated 
to produce a new toxin. Tn 1993, the Russian State Committee 
for Sanitary and Epidemiological Supervision claimed that death 
cap mushrooms had been definitively identified as the cause of 
all fatal cases of mushroom poisoning in Voronezh and other 
oblasts (IZVESTIYA 14 Aug 93). 
  Similar mass mushroom poisonings have occurred elsewhere. 
In 1991, Lugansk, Donets, and other regions of Ukraine 
experienced over 400 cases and 40 fatalities (Moscow ITAR-TASS 7 
Aug 92). Krasnodar Kray registered over 330 cases of mushroom 
poisoning and 40 deaths during the same year (Moscow TRUD 4 Mar 
93). The author of the ZDRAVOOKHRANENIYE ROSSTYSKOY FEDERATSII 
article, Voronezh epidemiologist T. Chubirko, thinks 
comprehensive studies should be done in these areas as well.

  [Abstract] The Laboratory of Bioluminescence and 
Bioacoustics of the Institute for the Biology of the Southern 
Seas, Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, in Sevastopol, has been 
studying the bioluminescent species of the Black Sea since 1965. 
Thirty-eight bioluminescent dinoflagellates have been 
identified, of which 13 were previously reported in the 
literature. The basic energetic parameters of the emissions 
exhibited by 30 of the species are tabulated. Changes in these 
parameters can serve as powerful indicators of anthropogenic 
pollution. The amplitude of the emission of Noctiluca miliaris 
changes with varying concentrations of phenol, PCB, or 
petroleum, or on exposure to gamma radiation. Chronic 35-day 
exposure was always found to convert initial stimulatory effects 
to inhibition. The early changes exhibited an oscillating 
nature, due to acclimatization. The amplitude of bioluminescence 
was found to be lowest at the center of the Sevastopol bay and 
highest ten miles from shore, with samples taken at five miles 
giving intermediate values. Heavy metals and other toxins may 
cause this change by decreasing the number and activity of 
scintillons, eliciting membrane degeneration, or inhibiting 
necessary enzyme systems. Figures 2; references 28: 17 Russian, 
11 Western.

  [Abstract] A method for the rapid detection of biotoxicants 
in natural fresh water was developed using the rate of 
protoplasm rotation in Vallisneria spiralis L. Microscopic 
observations were conducted on prosenchymal cells taken from 
areas near the central vascular fiber sheaf of Vallisneria 
leaves exposed to water samples fr 1-1.5 hours at 
20-24C, using the chloroplasts as markers of 
protoplasm movement. Weak toxicity elicited 
20%-50% decreases 
in movement or 20%-80% increases. Moderate 
toxicity caused 
decreases of 50%-80% or increases of 
80%-150%. Severe 
toxicity was seen at decreases of 80%- 90% and 
increases of 
150%-200%. Decreases of more than 90% and 
increases of more 
than 200% were lethal. Severe and lethal toxicity was 
accompanied by observable structural changes in the cells. 
Samples taken from the Dunay River in 1988 gave varying results, 
from 311% to 0. The stimulatory effects seen in the upper 
portions of the river were due to the presence of phosphates in 
the water. Tests conducted in 1991 on the Dneper Reservoir did 
not demonstrate any severe or lethal toxicity. Weak or moderate 
toxicity was characteristic of the bottom layers of dam head 
races, as well as various inlets small river mouths. Method 
response was determined as a function of the concentrations of 
Mn, Cu, Zn, and Ni. The data obtained demonstrate the 
suitability of the method for evaluating the quality of natural 
and waste water, as well as for screening new biologically-actve 
compounds. Figures 4; references 7 (Russian).

Urals Department; UDC 577.391.57.02] 
  [Abstract] Following the Chernobyl accident in April 1986, 
during the remainder of this year there were recorded no 
morphological changes in leaf trees but was recorded a high 
mortality of needle trees within the zone of heavy fallout and 
thus within a 30 km radius from the site of the nuclear power 
plant. Experiments have meanwhile indicated that symptoms of 
radiative damage including lethal one in trees may become 
evident not immediately after such an event but somewhat later. 
More than a year later, therefore, a study was made concerning 
the delayed effect of higher-level ionizing gamma background 
radiation on the generative and vegetative organs. Tests were 
performed in July-August 1987 on birch trees (Betula verrucosa 
Ehrh.) in three pine-birch woods located one 18 km south of, 6 
km south-east of, and 1.5 km west of the accident site. 
Irradiation with 100-150 gR doses of gamma rays was found not to 
have lowered the germinating capacity of birch seeds but to have 
reduced the viability of seedlings, parts of the latter grown 
from irradiated seeds having fallen off by the end of a 25 days 
long test. Most immune were found to be seedlings farthest from 
and south of the nuclear power plant. Based on a statistical 
analysis of germination energy and and seedling viability data, 
the reaction of this tree species to irradiation has been 
classified into three grades: 1) treetop, leaves, and aments not 
revealing any significant signs of damage after a 3.0 mR/h dose, 
2) entire treetops remaining alive and no loss of reproductive 
capability, but teratological changes such as bifurcation or 
contraction of some aments after a 20-40 mR/h dose; 3) loss of 
reproductive capability, partial or complete defoliation of 
branches, loss of chlorophyll at the edges of leaf blades after 
a 250 mR/h or larger dose. The larger than expected mass, i.e., 
number of seeds on trees exposed to higher-level background 
radiation is partly attributable to a smaller fraction among 
them of ``empty'' parthenocarpic ones, while stimulated action 
of small radiation doses coming from external sources and from 
radionuclides embedded in aments may be partly responsible for 
the higher germination energy. The higher resistance of such 
seeds to damaging gamma radiation indicates that may they have 
acquired some immunity during buildup and storage of small 
radiation doses, their large size possibly being another 
contributing factor. Figures 2; tables 4; references 9.

  [Abstract] 96 children (52 girls and 44 boys), one to seven 
years old, were examined during the aggravation of the 
ecological situation in the Central rayon of the city of Bratsk 
at the beginning of 1991. The ecological situation was 
aggravated by accumulation, due to calm weather, of industrial 
emissions of a timber industrial complex,aluminum smelting plant 
and thermoelectric power plant. The article calls the situation 
an ``ecologic explosion''. The obtained data were compared to 
the data of a similar 1990examination of 82 children (41 girls 
and a boy) in the same age group, when the air situation was 
relatively safe. Protein, carbohydrate and lipoid metabolisms, 
peroxidelipoid oxidation (PLO) processes, the activity of 
antiradical enzymes (catalase andperoxidase) and peroxide 
erythrocyte resistance (PER) were studied. The detected 
metabolic responses in preschool children during the especially 
unfavorable ecologicalsituation indicate a considerable strain 
of their homeostasis. The concentration of malone dialdehyde, an 
end product of PLO, in blood plasma and erythrocytes 
hadincreased, while the activity of antiradical enzymes 
(catalase and peroxidase decreased. The described children's 
metabolic responses demonstrate functionally unfavorable changes 
and the possibility of transformation of adaptation-adjustment 
responses during initial stages of pathological conditions.

614.73-07(477)] 
  [Abstract] When planning measures aimed at decontamination 
of settlements in the territory contaminated with radioactive 
substances as a result of the Chernobyl AES(ChAES) accident one 
should take into account the possibility of secondary 
radioactive contamination caused by natural factors (wind 
transfer, horizontal migration with sewage etc.) or 
anthropogenic contamination. The authors studied the likelihood 
of secondary radioactive contamination of a decontaminated 
settlement when agricultural work is performed. Studies were 
conducted in a settlement located 45 km NNW from the accident 
power unit. During the period of studies there was no 
precipitation, and air and the soil humidity was low. Analysis 
of the obtained data showed that dust transfer of radioactive 
substances within a 5 km radius during agricultural work had no 
significant effect on secondary contamination of the settlement. 
It is concluded that natural factors and technogenic action on 
soil cover, including agricultural work, have no tangible effect 
on secondary radioactive contamination of decontaminated 
settlements located in a territory with [.sup]137[/]Cs 
contamination of up to 2 MBq xm[.sup]-2[/]. However, it is 
noted that in extreme situations (tornadoes, dust storms, forest 
fires etc.) dust transfer of radioactive substances can have 
substantial effect on secondary contamination of the territory 
and warrants additional studies. References 2.

  [Abstract] The objective of the work was to substantiate 
the coefficient ofinterspecific extrapolation (CIE) based on 
results of comparison of the clinical picture of laser radiation 
(LR) injuries to human eyes (as a result of accidents) and eyes 
of laboratory animals - rabbits and monkeys (experimental data). 
The clinical picture of the injury focus was used as the 
equivalency criterion in determining the CIE, and the radiation 
energy, under equal or very close to equal action conditions, 
was used for comparison. Analysis was performed for LR with a 
1.064 mcm wavelength and 10-100 nspulse length. Based on the 
analysis of presented results it was concluded that eye immunity 
of 21-27 years old people to threshold action of laser radiation 
with the above parameters is higher than average eye immunity of 
rabbits and monkeys by a factor of not more than 2.8 - 2.1 mean 
with a mean deviation of plus or minus 0.7. This can be 
considered the maximum CIE value when determining maximum 
allowable levels of laser radiation based on data of 
experimental studies of laboratory animals. Tables 1,references

  [Abstract] Air environment in electronic industry 
production premises andhermetically sealed production equipment 
zones (PSPEs), which form a closed ecosystem,affects ergonomic 
production conditions, personnel efficiency and product quality. 
It is therefore necessary to continue to improve methodological 
support of systems for measurement and control of air 
environment. It is also important to control air pollution 
levels (APLs) to prevent ecotoxicants (ETs) from entering the 
personnel's organisms through inhalation. A procedure for 
forming information on size distribution of aerosol particles 
that can enter human body was developed. The methodological 
principles are used for deriving matrices of forming measurement 
information (MFMIs) are presented; estimates of the input of two 
fractions to the distribution of aerodispersed ET carrierphase 
are obtained as an example. Then the procedure is generalized to 
the case of three to four fractions, by introducing additional 
equations for constructing MFMIs. The procedure described in the 
article is aimed at measuring air pollution in PSPEs using 
impactors (devices that perform separation of aerosols by 
dispersion fractions). It makes it possible to construct MFMIs 
and estimate the input of individual consolidated dispersivity 
ranges and total concentration, in order to control labor 
conditions in an enterprise or to study new production processes 
aimed at developing recommendations on improving the processes 
in terms of their technological and hygiene criteria. References

  [Abstract] The configuration of an electric field (EF) in 
the electric power linezone is totally different from that of an 
alternating electric field (AEF): the former is arotating 
electric field (REF) characterized by circular or elliptic 
polarization, while the AEF has linear polarization. The article 
presents data on the response of skin epidermisand cornea of 
laboratory animals (unbred white mice) to chronic action of REFs 
(with a12.5 kV/m vertical and 11.0 kV/m horizontal EF component) 
and AEFs (with a 14.0 kV/mvertical EF component). A description 
and the electrical schematic of the experimental device is 
presented. It was determined that epidermis is affected by EP 
and responds to EP action by stabilizing geometric parameters. 
Tumors were detected in animals that had spent long time in EFs 
(mainly in REFs). In explaining mitotic activity of epidermis 
cells in these animals the author proceeds from the assumption 
that induced currents are the main factor in the effect of low 
frequency electromagnetic fields. The main process of EF 
(currents) interaction in a biological object takes place on the 
tissue and cell levels. The organism possesses effective 
protection against external low frequency EFs. Acceleration of 
rigor mortis had been detected in animals that spent at least 
1.5 months in an EF. There is no principle difference between 
high intensity industrial frequency alternating and rotating 
electric fields. It is concluded that low frequency EFs warrant 
further studies. The author contends that it is necessary 
perform separatenormalization of the time spent in an EF for 
REFs and AEfs. Figures 2, tables 2, references 18: 14 Russian, 4

  [Abstract] Dumping of anthropogenic materials including 
many toxic and mutagenic ones into the Kerch Straight, one of 
the most biologically productive areas of the Black Sea region, 
not only disrupts benthic biocoenoses, mussel banks, and 
traditional paths of fish migration but also causes a problem of 
contamination. The worst offenders are fine-disperse particles 
of contaminated soil, mainly aleurite and pelite. It therefore 
has been necessary to monitor the toxicity of the Kerch Straight 
ecosystem. Until 1989 this was done in shallow water on the 
Savenko bank or in an experimental dump site. Since then 
materials are being sampled in the mussel yard near cape Tuzla. 
During the 1989-90 period samples were taken, among others, for 
the purpose of determining the contamination of mollusks by 
organic chlorine compounds: 1),2) 
(_a_,_g_)-hexachlorocyclohexane, 3) DDT with its metabolites 
and 
polychlorobiphenyls. The specimens were analyzed by the method 
of gas-liquid chromatography in a ``Yanako'' G-180 F.E. 
instrument. During the March-April 1989 period of slow 
physiological mussel activity and low phytoplankton vegetation 
intensity the ratio of maximum to minimum pesticide 
concentrations in water and in mussel clusters was found to be 
most stable, owing to slowness of fermentation and of 
biochemical reactions in mollusks. No polychlorobiphenyls were 
found in the water during that period, evidently due to the 
effective action of DDT combined with fast cementation and 
subsequent fast sedimentation of particles. During the 
March-August 1990 period of massive soil dumping the 
concentrations of those compounds in both surface and bottom 
layers in three sampling sites were respectively: 1) 0.041 and 
0.044 mg/liter, 2) 0.026 and 0.027 mg/liter, 3) 0.020 and 0.024 
mg/liter. The absence of polychlorobiphenyls facilitates massive 
accumulation of insoluble organic chlorine compounds and their 
adsorption by particles suspended in deeper water. Their spatial 
overall distribution of organic chlorine indicates that they do 
not spread far to the north into shallow shelf water. Figures 2; 
tables 1; references 6.

  [Abstract] An ecological study in the region of the 
Karabash Copper Smelting Combine was begun in 1986, of concern 
being the effect of this industry on the mesofauna habitating in 
the soil. Soil specimens, 30x50x50 cm[.sup]3[/] large clods, 
were dug up according to standard procedure at five sites: four 
sites respectively 1.5-2.5-6.0-15 km south-east away from the 
factory in the direction of the dominant winds, the nearest site 
being a treeless hill, and one site 8 km north-west (against 
those winds) away from the factory. Generally, the total biomass 
and the numbers of animals were found to become smaller with 
decreasing distance from the pollution source. Noteworthy is the 
effect of industrial fallout on the taxonomic structure of the 
mesofauna: ants dominant 1.5-2.5 km SE, earthworms dominant 15 
km SE, both species and myriapodes in about equal numbers 8 km 
NW, earthworms and myriapodes along with click beetles still 
found 6 km SE away. Presence and absence of these species can 
serve as indicator for establishing the boundary of the 
``impacted'' zone around a copper smelting plant. Acidity 
measurements made in three successive soil layers yielded: pH 
3.6-3.8 in the 0-5 cm deep top layers and pH 5.6-6.4 in the 
15-30 cm deep lower layers at the sites nearest to the pollution 
source. Only the number of ants was found not to depend on the 
acidity of the top soil layer, that of all other species to 
strongly depending on it. The results of studies made concerning 
the phytomass in this region indicate that such a distribution 
of invertebrates in the soil is due to worsening of the soil 
quality in terms of phytocoenoses. Tables 1; references 10.

  [Abstract] In order to identify the contingent of students 
from senior classes in Ukraine who have eye pathologies and need 
special medical and social care, the researchers here used 
traditional clinical and ophthalmological methods to examine 
5,786 eighth- and ninth-grade students from 11 public education 
schools, seven special schools for the blind and vision 
impaired, and two schools for the deaf and hearing impaired in 
11 oblasts. Their examinations indicated that 89 percent of the 
school children have essentially healthy eyes and no 
contraindications for any of various kinds of production work. 
Such students included those with uncorrected visual acuity of 
0.6-0.8 and corrected acuity of 1.0. Only a small percentage of 
students in the public schools (0.2 percent) had pronounced 
visual problems, i.e., corrected visual acuity of 0.5 or lower 
in the better eye. That represents some 1,500 students 
graduating from the ninth grade each year. In all, 6.3 percent 
of those who graduate need some correction of their vision. 
Myopia is the pathology most frequently encountered among the 
public school students; those with severe myopia, however, 
account for only 0.2 percent of the graduating students. 
Virtually all the students found to have severe eye problems 
were from the special schools. References 10: 9 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] Between March 27 and 16 April 1991, in 10 rural 
population centers of Koryukovskiy Rayon, a total of 1,815 
children 14 years of age or under were examined by a team of 
specialists from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine for various 
visual problems. Eye pathology was found in 371 children, or 
20.4 percent, with the most common problem being refraction 
anomaly with lowered visual acuity. Congenital pathology was 
identified in 109 children. Inflammation was found in 70, and 
conjunctivitis in 54. In general, the incidence of eye pathology 
was a function of the overall gamma levels in the population 
centers. In the settlement of Kholmy, for example, where the 
gamma levels stood at 97 R/hr, roughly 30 percent of the 
children examined presented with eye pathology. References 6

  [Abstract] The use of existing decontamination solutions, 
in most cases, does not reduce radiation contamination to a 
standard for safe use, repair or removal of equipment from the 
30-km zone around the Chernobyl atomic energy plant. This is 
because the many colloid chemical and phsicochemical processes 
which occur during decontamination have not been sufficiently 
studied. This article studies in detail various colloid chemical 
processes that occur in decontamination and develops highly 
effective decontamination solutions based on domestically 
produced industrial reagents. The new decontaminant agents 
yielded a factor of 2-10 increase in the coefficient of 
decontamination. The best solution consisted of oxalic acid 
(0.3-01.0 % by mass), ethylenediaminetetraacetate 
(0.2-0.3%), 
oxalate of ammonia (0.1-0.2%) and SF-2U (a wetting agent, 
0.2-0.3 %) in water. The composition of the wetting agent

  [Abstract] This article presents a 
comparative analysis of the radioactive sensitivity of 
populations of a type of Pulmonata, Lymnaea stagnalis, obtained 
from bodies of water in the region polluted by the Chernobyl 
atomic energy plant and from unpolluted regions. According to 
various estimates, the radioactive sensitivity of mollusks is a 
factor of 20-30 lower than in mammals. Consequently, the 
processes of radioactive adaptation in their populations may be 
governed by different rules. The study was done in the summer of 
1991. Polluted samples were taken from the Pripyat River 15 km 
upstream from the Chernobyl plant. Control samples were obtained 
from the Krutynya River in Poland. Ground pollution levels and 
the content of radioactive isotopes (Cs, Sr) were analyzed. 
Adult mollusks were exposed to gamma radiation and observed. Two 
distinct mortality processes were found. This indicates the 
presence of two independent reactions to radiation with 
different mechanisms, each of which is fatal. The first occurs 
fairly rapidly, the second, more slowly. The Pripyat samples 
withstood the first phase better. In the second phase, the 
control samples fared better. Mollusks surviving the first phase 
produced viable eggs. The appearance of mutations is discussed.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from body of article by V. V. Kovalenko, candidate </F>
of the medical sciences, Scientific Research Laboratory of 
Preventive Ophthalmology and Ophthalmoergonomics of the Kharkov 
Regional Union of Scientists' Technical Support Service, 
Kharkov; signed to press 26 Oct 93; UDC 617.7:613.6(477)] 
  [Text] The birth of ophthalmoergonomics as a science was 
brought about by a profound change in the nature and conditions 
of human visual activity in all types of industry due to an 
increase in visual stress, the development of new technologies 
requiring strong visual resolution, and the broad application of 
non-verbal communications systems, including visual 
information-display systems. Environmental changes that pose 
human health hazards also fall within the scope of 
ophthalmoergonomics. 
  All adult age categories have seen a considerable rise in 
the 
number of cases of visual disorders that seriously impair visual 
acuity and negatively affect the quality and efficiency of 
visually intensive types of labor. The severity of these 
impairments varies from minor visual discomfort to complete 
disability in the performance of visual work. There are numerous 
cases in which the manifestation of clinical symptoms could, 
with complete justification, be diagnosed as ``visual strain 
syndrome.'' 
  Ophthalmoergonomics exists at the intersection of the 
disciplines of ophthalmology, ergonomics, and labor physiology. 
  If the task of ophthalmology is to diagnose and treat 
illnesses of and injuries to the eye, then the purpose of 
ophthalmoergonomics is to prevent the development of 
pathological changes in the visual organ as a result of 
occupational activity. This objective is realized by carefully 
studying how a particular occupation and its attendant working 
conditions affect human visual function, by evaluating the 
relationship between the initial health of visual structures and 
their response to these effects, and by finding optimal 
conditions for visual activity. Thus, the basic tasks of 
ophthalmoergonomics are: 

  -  develop a body of specific procedures and tests for 
evaluating visual function during different types of visual 
activity; 
  -  study the relationship between the functional characteristics 
of the visual structures and particular occupations, types of 
training, age, and working conditions; 
  -  develop occupationally useful criteria for various types of 
visual activity; 
  -  develop preventative measures that can be applied to the 
general public as well as to individuals; 
  -  develop occupation-specific therapies for treating people 
with 
occupationally related visual disabilities. 


    Like any other field of medicine, the study of 
ophthalmoergonomics is divided into two main subfields -- 
general and specialized ophthalmoergonomics. General 
ophthalmoergonomics is concerned with the methodological and 
procedural questions of ophthalmoergonomics research, visual 
ergonomic physiology, visual acuity and visual fatigue, and the 
professional diagnosis and treatment of patients working in 
vision-intensive occupations. Specialized ophthalmoergonomics 
encompasses all these disciplines as they apply to specific 
industries and occupations. 
  Ukrainian researchers in the field of specialized 
ophthalmoergonomics are doing a great deal of work in the area 
of vision and visual function in people who perform very close 
visual work. They have established and are developing a new 
field -- design engineering ophthalmoergonomics. This is a new 
field not only in ophthalmoergonomics, but in labor physiology 
as well. 
  An important branch of the ophthalmoergonomic sciences is 
the 
study of the visual health and acuity of people who work with 
video displays. Ukrainian researchers have made their 
contributions to this field as well. 
  Transportation ophthalmoergonomics, especially as it applies 
to marine transportation systems, has also been studied. 
  Ukrainian ophthalmology has traditionally emphasized the 
study of the visual structures of children and adolescents. An 
important aspect of this research has been the attempt to study 
the relationship between visual health and pathology and the 
conditions under which the visual analyzer functions. The field 
of ophthalmoergonomics as it applies to school-age children was 
founded in Ukraine.

  [Abstract] A portable device has been designed for 
bacteriologic air sampling at positive and negative 
temperatures. The device (M-15) consists of an intake inlets, an 
aerosol generation chamber, and a chamber for trapping bacteria 
on neutral granules coated with 1.5-2.0% starch solution 
for 
adhesiveness. Subsequent sample recovery and routine 
bacteriology yield bacterial counts per cubic meter of air.

  [Abstract] The article objective is to study changes in 
external geniculate body (EGB) neurons after removal of field 17 
of the visual cortex and immediate transplantation of embryonic 
nerve tissue (ENT) into the resulting cavity long time after the 
operation. Three)five months old Bright strain rats with removed 
cerebral cortex field 17 were used as recipients. The study of 
semifine sections of EGB tissue of recipient's brain 8, 11 and 
20 days after removal of field 17 demonstrated acute retrograde 
changes in the neurons. Electron microscope studies confirmed 
all symptoms of retrograde changes described in the literature. 
Ninety days after removal of field 17 of the vision cortex the 
ultrastructure of EGB neurons corresponded to a substantial 
degree to chronic retrograde changes. In studying semifine 
sections of brain tissue of a recipient with a neurotransplant 
one was able to see that the transplant was filling up the 
artificial cavity. Even 10 and 18 months after the removal the 
majority of nerve cells had practically normal structure. The 
results of the studies presented in the article demonstrated 
that one removal of field 17 of the brain of adult rats results 
in retrograde changes and the death of some EGB neurons within 
several weeks, while embryonic transplant of telencephalon 
prevents destructive processes in EGB neurons even long after 
the transplant operation. Figures 1, references 12: 1 Russian,

  [Abstract] Clinical trials were conducted with the 
polymeric adsorbent regenkur (previously designated tselosorb; 
weakly crosslinked cellulose ester) in the management of 
infected wounds. The patient cohort consisted of 60 men and 
women 20 to 80 years old with a variety of infected soft tissue 
wounds. Conventionally treated patients (42) with analogous 
lesions served as controls. The polymeric dressing was 
pretreated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and applied to wound 
surface in 2-3 mm thickness held in place by gauze. The number 
of changes per day varied from 3 to 14 for an average of 6.5. 
After 3 to 5 days (average 4.6 days) the experimental group 
showed significant reduction in bacterial wound contamination, 
followed by onset of granulation (4.3 days) and peripheral 
epithelialization (6.5 days). The duration of the hospital stay 
of the regenkur group was reduced by a third in comparison with 
the control patients. Thus, regenkur was shown to be an 
effective adsorbent promoting the removal of bacteria and 
exceeding the efficacy of the Swedish adsorbent debrizan [sic] 
(Pharmacia). Tables 2; references 3: 2 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] Experimental trials were conducted on 80-100 
guinea pigs with interscapular wounds infected with 10E9 E. coli 
K-11 cells to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a special 
surgical dressing. The latter consisted of dioxydin or 
terrilytin impregnated hydrophilic materials (HM; Ekran 
Scientific Industrial Association). Actual treatment consisted 
of application of the terrilytin-HM on the wound surface, 
followed by an overlay of the dioxydin-HM dressing. The results 
showed that the special combined HM dressing led to wound 
sterilization in 3 days (0% mortality) , vs. 14 days in 
control 
animals (33% mortality) managed in a conventional manner. 
Clinical benefits with the combined dressing also exceeded those 
of dioxydin-HM dressing alone. However, although the length of 
time required for complete epithiliazation did not differ in the 
control and experimental groups, these observations suggest that 
the combined HM may have application in human medicine in 
controlling wound infections. Tables 3; references 3 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Intravenous administration of a solution 
prepared by perfusing pig liver with physiologic saline 
significantly was shown to reduce mortality of mice and dogs 
with experimental sepsis due Staphylococcus aureus injections. 
Based on these results, analogous trials were conducted on 45 
male and female patients, 16-73 years old, with life-threatening 
pyoseptic conditions. The infusions were prepared by using 
dextran, 10% glucose or autogenous blood to perfuse the 
porcine 
spleen. The therapeutic regimen consisted of 400-500 ml (2-4 
ml/min drop-wise) of the solution given 1-6 times at 1-5 day 
intervals, 2-8 days after a surgical intervention. The 
beneficial effects of xenogeneic splenic therapy were most 
pronounced in 28 patients with destructive appendicites, 
cholecystitis and purulent peritonitis. Only 3 (10.8%) 
patients 
in that category died vs. a 26.7% mortality rate in 15 
control 
patients. In general, this therapeutic approach was least 
beneficial in patients with necrosis of the pancreas. However, 
the overall impression of this form of therapy remains a 
positive one and the benefits seem to result from detoxication 
and enhancement of immune reserves by bioactive splenic 
substances. The therapy is most beneficial when instituted early 
(12-48 h) in the disease process. Complications in the form of 
fever and chills were noted in 10% of the cases and 
readily 
controlled by antihistaminics and analgesics. Figures 1; tables 
1; references 16: 13 Russian, 3 Western.

  [Abstract] Clinical trials were conducted with porcine 
splenic homogenates in the management of infected wounds on 30 
patients, for comparison with a control group of 30 patients 
treated in conventional manner. The outcome demonstrated the 
efficacy of 2-5 applications of the homogenate: patients in the 
experimental group were discharged from the hospital on an 
average of 13.0 +/- 0.1 days earlier than the control subjects. 
Cytologic and bacteriological workups demonstrated that in the 
experimental group pus disappeared within an average of 3.0 +/- 
0.1 days and granulation tissue appeared in 4.0 +/- 0.4 days, 
whereas in the control group analogous manifestations required 
9.0 +/- 0.4 and 8.1 +/- 0.2 days, respectively. In general, the 
effects were attributed to absorptive capacity of the 
homogenates for bacteria, their metabolites and cell detritus, 
as well as anti-inflammatory factors. Tables 1; references 3

  [Abstract] Zone inhibition studies were conducted on 
Micrococcus lysodeicticus to test wound discharges for 
antimicrobial activity and to ascertain whether such activity 
provides an indication of wound healing. The technical details 
involved preparation of 5 mm diameter discs from filter paper 
for saturation with the discharge material and assessment of 
growth inhibition on solid medium. Studies on 70 male and female 
patients, 18 to 70 years old, with postsurgical abdominal 
infections demonstrated a positive correlation between the 
degree of inhibition and abatement of the infectious process. 
Thus, a high degree of antibacterial activity of the discharge 
can be used to monitor the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy and 
the proper time for application of secondary sutures. References

<F P=106> [Report by V.P. Voytenko and Ye.M. Libmanova (Based on </F>
Materials of the Ecodefencinform Agency): ``Mortality and Life 
Expectancy in Ukraine''] 
  [Text] A conference entitled ``Ecology, Health, and 
Old Age'' was held quite recently at the Gerontology Institute 
of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences in Kiev. Taking 
part in this conference's work were staffers of the scientific 
organs under the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and Academy of 
Medical Sciences, as well as those from the Ukrainian Ministry 
of Education. Twelve reports by prominent specialists in the 
fields of ecology, medicine, and gerontology were discussed 
here. The conference's goal was to thoroughly analyze the 
consequences of the ecological situation which has evolved in 
Ukraine and which has evoked deep concern. This conference also 
had the goal of discussing possible ways to extricate ourselves 
from this crisis-type situation. The initiator for holding this 
conference--the Gerontology Institute--hopes and anticipates 
that the most adequate ways will be found for overcoming the 
symptoms which menace our nation's health. This hope likewise 
unites the efforts of scientists in various fields and 
practicing specialists. 
  Press Center of the Ukrainian Health Center 
  According to data published by the World Health Organization 
in 1990, Ukraine ranks 45th out of 65 countries in average life 
expectancy for women, and it ranks 54th for men. 
  The principal cause of death in Ukraine consists of diseases 
of the circulatory system. Our fellow-countrymen are dying from 
these diseases not only more freqently, but also earlier: The 
greatest losses of life--as compared with our foreign 
counterparts--occur between the ages of 45 and 65. Of particular 
significance are deaths from cardiovascular diseases in 
Zarkarpat, Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, 
and Zaporozhye oblasts, as well as throughout the entire 
territory of Southern Ukraine. 
  Ranking second in importance as a cause of death 
(contributed 
to by pollution of the environment and by tobacco smoking) are 
malignant new growths--tumors and cancers. Kiev, as well as the 
industrial oblasts of the western and southern regions, have 
become particularly hazardous with regard to such oncological 
diseases. 
  Ranking third are accidents, poisonings, and injuries. The 
number of injury-caused deaths--which was reduced by the 
short-term success of the anti-alcohol campaign--has begun to 
increase again since 1988. 
  Increasing the life expectancy in Ukraine is possible 
provided that there are changes in the mortality structure. In 
the first place, what we are talking about here is a reduction 
in the role played by deaths from infectious diseases and 
injuries. In the second place, it is a matter of reducing the 
average number of deaths from cardiovascular and oncological 
diseases. Successfully performing both of these tasks is 
connected--in one way or another--with solving our economic 
problems. An increase in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 
personal consumption (PC) by 1,000 ``international dollars'' 
would allow an increase in life expectancy of 0.5 years for men 
and 1 year for women. But this ratio is not absolute. The 
greatest life expectancy is not in the United States (which 
ranks first in personal consumption), but rather in Japan (which 
ranks 22nd in personal consumption). That is to say, 
extra-ecological factors are also of essential importance, in 
particular, life style and the nature (not merely the quantity) 
of the personal consumption involved. This furnished optimism 
for those who are poor. 
  Most urgent for Ukraine is investing in the preservation and 
safeguarding of nature, even though restoring the environment to 
good health will not have an effect on mortality very soon. 
<H8>  Prognosis </H8>
  The Central Region (the city of Kiev, as well as 
Poltava, Chernigov, Zhitomir, Sumy, Cherkassy, Vinnitsa, and 
Kiev oblasts) is characterized by a relatively favorable 
mortality structure-one closely approximating international 
standards. Serving as a foreign analogue to the mortality 
pattern here could be Belgium during the early 1960's (for men) 
and during the late 1970's (for women). 
  The Western Region (Lvov, Khmelnitskiy, Chernigov, 
Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol, Volyn, Rovno, and Zakarpat oblasts) 
slightly exceeds the average level for Ukraine with regard to 
life expectancy; however, it is progressing quite slowly. The 
unfavorable mortality trends in Zakarpat Oblast provide grounds 
for doubting the reliability of the health statistics in this 
oblast, as well as in Ivano-Frankovsk and Volyn oblasts. Among 
the European countries an analogue may be seen with France 
during the early 1960's (for men) and during the late 1960's 
(for women). 
  The Eastern Region (Donetsk, Dnepropetrovsk, 
Kharkov, and Lugansk oblasts) is characterized not only by a 
high present-day level of mortality, but also by a stagnation of 
its basic indicators during the last 10 years. It is analogous 
to Finland during the early 1970's. 
  The Southern Region (Crimea, as well as Kherson, 
Kirovograd, Nikolayev, and Odessa oblasts) is the most 
unfavorable zone. In fact, it is a zone of increased risk for 
health and life (especially the maritime rayons of Kherson and 
Odessa oblasts). The closest analogue is Spain during the late 
1950's (for men) and the late 1960's (for women).

Democratic Green Party of Chelyabinsk Oblast: ``I Want To Tell 
You About the Chelyabinsk Tragedy''] 
  [Text] Ukrainian People's Deputy Volodymyr 
Yavorivskyy quite recently received a letter which related the 
fate suffered by the hostages of the ``Urals Chernobyl''--the 
Mayak Industrial Combine. Volodymyr Oleksandrovych conveyed this 
letter to our newspaper, as its author had requested. We offer 
it here for your attention. 
  Dear fellow-countrymen! 
  I am writing to you from the distant Ural city of 
Chelyabinsk. I was born near Kherson, studied at Odessa 
University, worked for 11 years at the Odessa Polytechnical 
Institute, and I have been here for 26 years--at the Chelyabinsk 
Technical University. 
  My older children and grandchildren are Ukrainians, whereas 
my younger daughter is Russian; I have brothers and sisters 
living in Kiev, Kherson, Odessa, and Moscow. Both Ukrainian and 
Russian cultures are near and dear to me. In my soul and in my 
consciousness Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal peoples. 
  I want to tell you about the Chelyabinsk tragedy so that you 
may know what is menacing you. 
  Some 45 years ago in this short-lived ``Ural Switzerland'' 
an 
enterprise began to be built for the purpose of making an atom 
bomb. The best minds of our nation were brought here, and they 
worked self-sacrificingly, believing in the need to create an 
atomic shield for our Fatherland. This plant was built in record 
time. 
  But the technology of radiation safety was still at a very 
low level at that time. Plutonium was carried about in glass 
vessels, adulterated radioactive wastes were poured into the 
small Techa River, on the bank of which the ``Mayak'' Chemical 
Combine was situated. That came to be the name of the production 
association which produced nuclear weapons. 
  Thousands of nuclear specialists and service personnel 
perished during the first few years of Mayak's operation, and 
nobody has ever counted the number of people living around there 
who also were lost. 
  Finally the authorities came to their senses and began to 
resettle people away from the river. They fenced it about with 
barbed wire and prohibited people from drinking its water, 
bathing in it, or watering their cattle in it. But for many 
years they did not explain to people the reason for these 
prohibitions. And people used to drink contaminated milk, eat 
vegetables from cities which used water from the Techa for 
irrigation purposes, and they continued to bathe in this river. 
  The average life expectancy declined to 40 years. And these 
could not really be called lives. Everone's bones hurt, they had 
headaches, they were weak, and suffered from bleeding. And in 
the town of Ozersk (Chelyabinsk-65) more and more children came 
into the world with birth defects. Whereas in 1955 these 
amounted to 10-11 per 1000 births, in 1988 this indicator stood 
at 22 per 1000 births. 
  Another misfortune was that the medical personnel were 
forbidden to make correct diagnoses. This was a state secret. 
The physicians had to sign an agreement not to divulge their 
diagnoses. How many tragedies could have been averted if it had 
not been for this anti-humane decree or regulation! 
  In 1957 there was an explosion at a tank in which diluted 
radioactive wastes (RAO) were being stored for safekeeping. As a 
result of this rupture, a trail 105 km long and 8-10 km in width 
was created. The fate of the persons who happened to be on the 
territory of this radioactive trail was tragic. Without any 
explanations of the reasons for this, all such persons were 
herded into barracks; their clothing and personal effects were 
burned, and they were given different clothing. A ditch was dug, 
and bulldozers were used to dump everything in it together with 
the cattle and bury the whole lot. The people were hauled away 
and resettled in temporary buildings. And then they were 
forgotten. 
  The third significant accident at the Mayak Chemical Combine 
occurred in 1967. After the toxification of the Techa people 
began pouring RAO into man-made or natural lakes. In one such 
lake, in Karachay, RAO accumulated having an activity factor of 
600 million Curie units (12 times greater than the amount 
emitted at the time of the Chernobyl disaster). 
  The summer of 1967 was a scorcher. The Karachay grew very 
shallow; the banks became denuded; the radioactive algae and mud 
dried up and turned into dust. The wind raised this lethal dust 
and and carried out about over an area inhabited by close to a 
half a million people. 
  Small or modest-sized accidents which occur--in the 
specialists' words--within the ``regulated system'' (that is, 
with discharges less than the allowable parameters) happen all 
the time and with great frequency. Thus, for example, on 17 July 
of last year there occurred a discharge at one subdivision of 
the Mayak Chemical Combine; and a slurry pipeline burst on 4 
August. 
  The authorities reassure us that such discharges are less 
than the parameters of the allowable norms, but we doubt that 
the grounds justifying these norms are adequate. Furthermore, 
their frequency is so great that the sum-total turns out to be 
significant. 
  The swamps and ground waters of our oblast contain a total 
RAO having an activity of 1 billion, 300 million Curie units 
(equivalent to approximately 26 Chernobyls). There are 935 
persons here who are ill with radiation sickness. Our hematology 
units at the local treatment facility are completely filled with 
sick children; 80 percent of them will die, and their places 
will be taken by others. 
  The nuclear shield of the Fatherland not only protects but 
also kills people. The military-industrial complex throughout 
the world is guided solely by its own departmental interests, as 
well as by the desire to preserve and safeguard its own 
scientific potential, its own privileged position, and with 
those of people in general. 
  We consider that nuclear production--including nuclear 
electric-power engineering--is leading us to destruction. We 
must re-orient ourselves as rapidly as possible to alternative 
energy sources. For gigantomania will utterly ruin us.

<F P=106> [Article by O. Kharlamenko, head of the Mariopol PZU (Green </F>
Party of Ukraine) Club, and L. Olshevskyy, member of the ZELENYY 
SVIT UEA (Ukrainian Ecodefencinform Agency): ``Why Are There So 
Few Happy Families in Mariopol?''] 
  [Text] During the first quarter of last year 800 marriages 
were registered in Mariopol, whereas 764 divorces were 
registered during this same period. According to data from a 
sociological poll conducted by a civic organization here, the 
principal reason for such ``family'' instability is the 
infertility and impotence of this city's human population. These 
factors have reached 60 percent and 33 percent respectively. 
  However, even if a family in Mariopol has a ``real man,'' 
that does not necessarily mean that such a family will add a 
third or fourth member. The rate of stillbirths and infant 
mortality before the age of one year during the period 1989-1991 
varied between 45 percent and 50 percent. Thanks to modern-day 
medicine, this indicator declined to 26 percent in 1992. But 
this was specifically due to ultrasonic diagnostics and the 
interruption of pregnancy in cases where anomalies were 
discovered. And this was already after nature itself had made a 
choice: From 1989 through 1992 the number of miscarriages 
increased from 24 to 32 per 100 pregnancies. 
  Nor can those families in which an infant has arrived always 
be called happy. Of each 1000 children, 22 are born with birth 
defects (for the sake of comparison, in Simferopol this 
indicator stands at 8). 
  At a time when the birth rate is declining, the mortality 
rate is rising: During the first quarter of 1993 it increased by 
25 percent in comparison with this same period in 1992. But what 
do births and deaths have in common? The connecting link here is 
a cancer-treatment facility which was built for 90 beds but 
which now has 220. 
  This situation is dreadful, but it can be explained. This 
city with its 540,000 inhabitants provides 35 percent of 
Ukraine's steel and 30 percent of Ukraine's sheet metal. 
Mariopol also produces 90 percent of all kinds of septic tanks, 
as well as equipment for metallurgical and ore-enriching 
complexes. It carries out contracts for the Ministry of Medium 
Machine Building, and--in addition--has a plant producing 
medical equipment, as well as very large construction 
enterprises. The Mariopol seaport is the biggest on the shores 
of the Sea of Azov. Its annual goods turnover amounts to 12 
million tonnes. Plying the world's oceans are at least 100 ships 
of the Azov Shipping Company, which are registered in the Port 
of Mariopol. 
  And all these entities are gasping and spewing out terrible 
poisons. Two steel-smelting plants and one coal-tar chemical 
plant have become particularly old and obsolete. This complex, 
which still bears the name of Illich, is regarded as the most 
modern and up-to-date in Ukraine. Among its production 
facilities, which extend around the city's outskirts, is an 
open-hearth shop with three furnaces having a capacity of 900 
tonnes each and three others having a capacity of 650 tonnes 
each. It has these furnaces, but they lack any equipment for 
combatting the contaminants from them. During the last 30 years 
unsafe wastes discharged by these plants have accumulated in 
enormous quantities in bodies of water which are unsuitable for 
this purpose. Solid wastes alone, which include 75 percent iron 
compounds, 1 percent manganese compounds, and 1.2 percent zinc 
compounds, have accumulated to the extent of more than a million 
tonnes. People say that during the Soviet Union period the 
Japanese wanted to acquire all of these materials wholesale, but 
the Soviet government refused--saying that not a single gram of 
strategic raw material should be turned over to a potential 
enemy. And the adulterated wastes have been abandoned at two 
dump sites, from which sufuric acid has already been leaking for 
many years now. 
  That which the people of Mariopol drink can hardly be termed 
``water.'' The small Northern Donets River, which constitutes 
the principal source of water here, is dreadfully polluted, and 
the purification station is not operating in accordance with the 
normative requirements. Its operators have been compelled to add 
more chlorine than provided for by the norms, but that still 
does not help the situation much because waste waters are 
seeping into the system. 
  At one time Mariopol was a health-resort area. But nowadays 
the beaches are closed down every year. Salmonela bacteria have 
been found near the waste-water discharge collectors on the 
beaches, and cholera bacteria have been found in the Kalchyk 
Stream, which winds its way through the city. 
  It is not an easy matter to track down all these bad things, 
all the more so in that there are only five inspectors on the 
staff of the Ministry for Environmental Protection's local 
administration. Efforts to reinforce them should not be impeded. 
It would also be a good idea to outfit them with up-to-date 
monitoring equipment. Only when a correct diagnosis has been 
made and effective monitoring controls set up will we be able to 
actually proceed to carry out plans providing for the 
development of alternative industrial sectors, the optimization 
and modernization of metallurgical enterprises, as well as 
putting new purification capacities into operation.

  [Abstract] Professional oil and gas drillers working on a 
special shift schedule on offshore rigs on the Arctic 
continental shelf were studied in detail to ascertain the impact 
exerted on their health and work performance by the severe 
climatic conditions and disrupted family life. Since it is known 
that many are physically and psychologically ill-suited for such 
work, an effort was made to define screening criteria to be used 
in selecting such personnel. The work, carried out in three 
stages, involved a sample of 200 workers from drilling teams and 
a control group of 200 land transportation workers. The 
incidence of illness and duration of accompanying incapacity in 
the study group were analyzed, but special attention also was 
given to the frequency of occurrence of accidents, which are 
quite common and result in inability to perform tasks for 
protracted periods. These were more numerous than in the 
control. Different afflictions played the most important roles 
in the study and control groups and the days of work loss were 
greater in the former than in the latter. Acute, chronic and 
latent diseases were greater in the study group than in the 
control group by a factor of 8. A psychophysiological study of 
the personality was made with respect to 32 parameters, 
including the implications of introversion and extroversion in 
subjects of both groups, which are to be taken into account in 
future screening. A wide range of physiological factors was 
examined as applicable to professional selection for work in the 
Far North. The results of the study have been used in 
formulating rehabilitation programs. References: 17 Russian.

  [Abstract] A study was made to determine the influence of 
movement and life style of migrants on their health and to 
formulate recommendations on upgrading the health level and work 
performance of males arriving at an industrial plant in 
Krasnoyarsk, Eastern Siberia, from different regions of the 
country. The total migrant work force (in residence 6 months-13 
years) was 34.4%. The studied sample was made up of 635 
males; 
the control group consisted of an equal number of locally born 
males. The sample was then broken down into three age groups, 
work categories and regions of origin. Among the many factors 
considered were: education, family makeup and living conditions 
(a total of 34 variables were defined). Correlation coefficients 
were found between 10 subjective and objective health indices, 
on the one hand, and 9 life style factors, on the other hand. It 
was found that the key factors responsible for an increase in 
the number and duration of illnesses, in decreasing order of 
correlation with health indices, are: low education, absence of 
a family, absence of earlier migrations, urban origin, low 
physical activity, poor eating habits, greatest geographical 
contrast from region of origin, inadequate knowledge about a 
healthy life style and unsatisfactory living conditions. The 
incidence of illness among these migrants was much greater than 
for native inhabitants and the costs for their medical care were 
correspondingly much greater. All this is particularly true for 
the first three years of adaptation. Accordingly, the employment 
of local inhabitants is economically far more advantageous. In 
the event of a labor shortage in a particular place special 
health facilities and monitoring must be made available for 
those brought in from the outside.

  [Editorial Report] 
Materials 
  A new material obtained by scientists from the 
Dnepropetrovsk Medical Institute and the local university's 
physics department shields against radiation and x-rays 
1.5-times better than lead. The material can be used in the 
manufacture of protective clothing (Moscow TRUD 13 Oct 93). 
Pharmaceuticals 
  The Crimean Medical Institute's Department of Microbiology 
has developed a new antiseptic, Miramistin, claimed to be ``many 
times superior to comparable medicinal preparations.'' 
Miramistin has undergone successful clinical tests for 
treatment of septic wounds, burns and AIDS (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI 29 Oct 93). 
  Kukumariozid, a pharmaceutical derived from wastes left 
after 
processing of the sea cucumber Cucumaria, stimulates the immune 
system to combat viral infections and relieve stress. The 
Pacific Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Far East 
Division of Academy of Sciences, which developed the drug, is 
preparing it in small batches for use in veterinary medicine, 
where it is effective in 95 percent of cases. Kukumariozid is 
being studied for possible use in medicine (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE 
VESTI 29 Oct 93). 
  The Kharkov Food Industry Institute has developed candies 
containing phytosorbent additives that reduce the accumulation 
of radiation in human organs. The Bershad plant, which is 
manufacturing these candies for sale throughout Ukraine, will 
soon begin production of antiradiation zeolites (Moscow 
NEZAVISKIMAY GAZETA 5 JAN 94). 
Treatments 
  Specialists from the Ear, Nose and Throat Institute have 
patented a new surgical technique which uses remaining tissues 
and muscles to reconstruct the vocal apparatus after throat 
cancer surgery. The novel method has been tested on 500 
patients. Ninety-four percent of patients began to talk 10-15 
days after surgery, and vocal quality was essentially normal 
(Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 15 Nov 93). 
Equipment 
  The Donetsk Scientific Production Association Respirator, 
which previously developed medical evacuation complexes for 
returning astronauts is producing a model freestanding, mobile 
field hospital for responding to natural catastrophes and other 
emergencies. The complex consists of a rubberized fabric 
structure which is rapidly assembled by pumping air into a 
pneumatic framework. The structure is equipped with climate 
control, energy supply, and fire extinguishing systems. The 
customer is the Russian Republic's Emergency and Catastrophic 
Medicine Association (Moscow ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI 29 Oct 93). 
  Medical lasers in use at the Russian Federation Health 
Ministry's new All-Russian State Research Center are products of 
conversion projects. The Raduga-1 contact aluminum laser, 
created by the Polyus Scientific Production Association in 
Moscow, is used for bloodless dissection of muscle tissue and 
resection of internal organs. The Istok Scientific Production 
Association near Moscow designed the Raduga-1F laser, which the 
Center uses for endocoagulation. The press report claims that 
Moscow scientists' developments in this field are ``3-5 years 
ahead of Western counterparts.'' The Center, which was created 
to monitor the field of laser medicine and provide training, has 
signed a contract to deliver laser equipment to India, train 
Indian doctors in Moscow, and set up a branch of the Center in 
Dharwar. Reportedly it has also been negotiating with the 
Turkish company Asia Ltd., private clinics in Madrid and Paris 
and the Phillipines Health Ministry (MOSCOW NEWS 1 Oct 93). 
  Minatom's Moscow Institute of Theoretical and Experimental 
Physics has developed a new small-scale, portable synchrotron 
for administering proton radiation treatment to patients with 
cancers, endocrine disorders and other serious diseases. The 
institute has treated 2,500 patients and plans to increase its 
patient load (Moscow ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA 12 Oct 93). 
  Reacting to a sharp drop in orders for its scientific 
developments and acute brain drain, the Samara State Aerospace 
University imeni Academician S. P. Koroleva is seeking sponsors 
for production of special vibration-vacuum nozzles designed for 
urological, stomatological, and cosmetological procedures. The 
mechanism of the therapeutic effect was tested at the Main 
Military Clinical Hospital imeni N. N. Burdenko, the Central 
Scientific Research Institute for Physiotherapy and Moscow State 
Medical University (Moscow DELOVOY MIR 29 May 93). 
  Fifty million rubles is needed to initiate production of a 
unique light-conducting disposable needle designed for 
intravenous irradiation. The newly patented device was developed 
by the Interlaz Scientific Research Center in collaboration with 
the Institute of Laser Medicine. Interlaz is unable to afford 
credit rates and lacks working capital (Moscow DELOVOY MIR 30 
Nov 93).

  [Abstract] Nootropic drugs have a marked effect on the 
biological activity of animals' brains when used for prolonged 
periods (months). For this reason, the dynamics of the effects 
of three nootropic drugs, i.e., piracetam, meclofenoxate, and 
mexidole, on the brain activity of a total of 32 nonpedigree 
male rats (weight, 180 to 250 g) was studied. The animals in 
group 1 received intraperitoneal [IP] injections of piracetam in 
a dose of 500 mg/kg daily for 2 months, the group 2 animals 
received IP injections of meclofenoxate in a dose of 70 mg/kg 
daily for 5 months, and the group 3 animals received IP 
injections of mexidole in a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 5 
months. The control rats received a physiological solution under 
analogous conditions. The studies of the bioelectric activity of 
the rats' brains were carried out when the rats were wide awake 
and unrestrained. Five to 6 days before the neurophysiological 
experiments, the rats were anesthestetized with nembutal (50 
mg/kg IP), and monopolar Nichrome electrodes were implanted into 
the sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocampus of their brains. 
Fourier spectral analysis of encephalograms [EEGs] of the rats' 
brains was performed by using a Berg-Fourier Analyzer (O.T.E. 
Biomedica, Italy) and an analysis period of 4 minutes 8 seconds. 
Bioelectric activity was recorded in 5-minute segments before 
and after (for 2-3 hours) injection of the drugs. The studies 
established that prolonged injection of piracetam results in an 
intensification and stabilization of the dominant power peak of 
the _th_-range (4-8 Hz) and a simultaneous decrease in the 
power 
of the _a_-range (8-13 Hz). A statistically significant 
decrease 
was noted in the fast-wave _b_[.sub]1[/]-range (13-20 Hz) of 
the power spectra of the cortex EEGs. In the hippocampus, on the 
other hand, piracetam induced a decrease in the relative power 
of the _th_-range, ahthough it still exceeded the values found 
for intact animals. At the same time there was a decrease in the 
power of the _a_-range and an increase in the power of the 
_b_-range (13-32 Hz) of the spectra of the EEGs of the 
hippocampus when compared with the values obtained for one-time 
administration of piracetam in intact animals. Discontinuation 
of piracetam did not cause any drastic changes in bioelectric 
activity or in the respective power spectra of the EEGs of both 
brain structures studied. Prolonged administration of 
meclofenoxate was found to significantly alter the structure of 
the EEG power spectra, especially in the case of EEGs recorded 
for the cortex. Not only was the primary peak in the 
_th_-intensified, but the power of the _a_-range increased 
significantly as well because of the appearance of a pronounced 
dominant rhythm with a frequency of 10-12 Hz. High-amplitude 
fluctuations in bioelectric activity (i.e., fluctuations with 
the same frequency) developed as well. The appearance of a new 
peak with a frequency of 10-12 Hz was characteristic for nearly 
half the animals after one-time administration of meclofenoxate. 
Discontinuation of meclofenoxate resulted in an intensification 
of the dominant peak and a lengthening of the period of 
high-amplitude discharges (frequency, 10-12 Hz) in the 
bioelectric activity of the rat brains' cortices. Chronic use of 
mexidole was found to increase the dominant peak in the 
_th_-range more markedly than in the case of one-time 
administration of the drug. An increase in the 
_b_[.sub]1[/]-range of frequencies was another characteristic 
effect of prolonged mexidole use. Discontinuation of mexidole 
resulted in significant changes in the bioelectric activity and 
power spectra of the EEGs recorded for both the cortex and 
hippocampus. High-amplitude fluctuations that gradually 
increased and subsided (frequency, 8-12 Hz) appeared in the EEGs 
recorded for both the cortex and hippocampus but especially for 
those of the cortex. Prolonged injection enhanced the effect of 
all three drugs as compared with the effects achieved after 
one-time administration. The EEG-level effects of the three 
drugs were confirmed by observations of the rats' behavior: All 
three drugs increased the rats' levels of wakefulness and 
excitability. Figures 2, table 1; references 14: 10 Russian, 4

  [Abstract] The effects of haloperidol administered via 
repeated intraperitoneal [IP] injection (2 mg/kg) were compared 
with those of haloperidol administered via bilateral injection 
into the striatum (5 g) of male Wistar rats weighing 200 to 
250 g each in two series of experiments that each involved two 
groups of rats. In series 1, nine rats received 0.3-ml IP 
injections. The animals in group 1 received haloperidol in a 
dose of 2 mg/kg, and those in the control group were injected 
with a physiological solution. In series 2, 10 rats were 
injected with haloperidol bilaterally into the rostral region of 
the neostriatum through cannulas that had been implanted in them 
while they were anesthetized. The cannulas implanted into the 
group 1 animals were filled with a 5 percent haloperidol 
solution sufficient for several dozens of injections, whereas 
the cannulas implanted in the group 2 animals were filled with a 
physiological solution. Each injection had a volume of 1 l 
(5 
g haloperidol). The microinjections were begun 3 days after 
the implantation operations and were continued daily for 3 
weeks. The rats were tested for catalepsy 10 and then 30 minutes 
after each injection, and their spontaneous motor activity was 
evaluated between 20 and 25 minutes after injection. The 3-week 
course of daily microinjections of 5 g of haloperidol into 
the rats' neostriatum induced a set of Parkinsonism-like 
symptoms in the form of rigidity and akinesia but not in 
catalepsy. IP injection of haloperidol, on the other hand, 
resulted in inhibition of conditioned avoidance reflexes and in 
catalepsy. The effects of haloperidol began to appear on day 7 
of the experiment, gradually increased, and persisted until 
several days after the haloperidol was discontinued. The toxic 
effects of haloperidol that are inevitable when the drug is 
administered systemically for a prolonged period were completely 
absent in the mice studied. Instead, the effects of the 
haloperidol proved reversible and remained localized. Like other 
researchers, the authors of this study were unable to achieve 
parkinsonian syndrome in rats by system injection of 
haloperidol. They attributed this fact to specific differences 
between mice and humans and emphasized the fact that chronic 
injection of haloperidol into the striatum did not result in 
catalepsy, which appears to contradict thinking regarding the 
involvement of the striatum and its dopaminergic system in the 
pathogenesis of cataleptic rigidity. The authors explained this 
phenomenon by stating that local injection results in different 
pharmacologic loads that do not trigger catalepsy but that 
instead induce akinesia similar to parkinsonian akinesia. They 
further stated that consideration must be given to the fact that 
in the case of systemic injection, neuroleptics exert a mediated 
effect on the central nervous system through somatic systems 
(for example, because of a change in the content of metals in 
blood plasma, which in turn results in a whole set of 
biochemical disorders). Figure 1; references 10: 6 Russian, 4

  [Abstract] A study examined the effects of selected -, 
-, and _ch_-opiate receptor agonists on the activity of 
the 
viscerosomatic convergent neurons of the spinal dorsal horns of 
male ICI/Wistar rats (weight, 250-350 g) that had been implanted 
with cutaneous and visceral single-channel glass 
microelectrodes. A Cardio 80 computer (Contron) was used to 
analyze the neurons' activity and to plot poststimulation 
histograms. The rats' somatic afferent nerves were stimulated by 
measured squeezing of the skin on the foot of their rear 
extremity. Their pelvic afferent nerves were stimulated by 
blowing into a thin-walled envelope that had been inserted into 
their rectums and into the distal sections of their sigmoid 
colons. Both types of stimulation were accomplished by devices 
permitting digital control of the duration and intensity of 
stimulation. During the experiments the rats were anesthetized 
with chloralose, immobilized with Flaxedil, and kept warm (their 
esophageal temperature was kept at 37C, and the 
pCO[.sub]2[/] of their expired air was maintained at 3.5-4 
volume percent). When a rat's arterial pressure dropped below 
80/50 mm Hg, the experiment was halted. The following drugs were 
administered to the rats: morphine (10[.sup]-6[/] to 
10[.sup]-5[/] M), DAGO [expansion not given] (5 x 
10[.sup]-7[/] to 10[.sup]-6[/] M), D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and 
D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline (10[.sup]-6[/] to 
10[.sup]-5[/] M), dalargin (10[.sup]-6[/] to 
10[.sup]-5[/] M), U-50488H (10[.sup]-4[/] M), 
dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] (10[.sup]-4[/] M), and naloxone. 
The -opiate receptor agonists morphine and DAGO and the 
-opiate receptors D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and 
D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline and dalargin suppressed the 
bioelectric activity of the convergent neurons of the dorsal 
horns of the rats' spines. The suppressive effects of all of the 
drugs were found to be concentration dependent and sensitive to 
naloxone. When the aforesaid drugs were locally applied to the 
spine, they suppressed reactions to somatic nociceptive 
stimulation more strongly than they suppressed reactions to 
visceral stimulation. When injected intravenously, morphine had 
an identical effect on suppression of both types of stimulation. 
Ligands of the _ch_-opiate receptors U-50488H and 
dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] were not found to have any 
statistically significant effect on the bioelectric activity of 
the convergent neurons of the rear horn of the spine. Tables 2;

  [Abstract] Wistar rats were anesthetized with nembutal (40 
mg/kg). Polyethylene catheters were inserted into each rat's 
left ventricle through its right carotid artery. The coronary 
vessels of seven rats were embolized for a length of 15 m by 
radioactive microspheres injected into the cavity of the left 
ventricle during occlusion of the ascending aorta. The seven 
control rats were subjected to pseudo-operations, during which 
they were subjected to the same procedures performed on the rats 
in the experimental group. During the occlusion procedure, 
however, they received a physiological solution instead of the 
microspheres. Twenty-one days later the rats that had been 
implanted with catheters in their left ventricle, femoral 
artery, and jugular vein 1 day before the experiment began were 
selected for testing. Indicators of the rats' general and 
regional hemodynamics in response to intravenous ouabain 
infusion (in a dose of 0.4 mg/kg for 1 minute at a constant rate 
of 26 m/min for 3 minutes) were studied while the rats were 
wide awake. At the conclusion of the tests the rats were killed 
with a large dose of nembutal, their organs removed and tissues 
weighed, and the amount of microspheres trapped in them and the 
amount of microspheres in blood samples from each rat 
determined. When compared with the controls, the rats whose 
coronary arteries had been embolized manifested higher 
end-diastolic pressure and peripheral resistance and a decrease 
in cardiac output and heart rate. These changes were accompanied 
by a statistically significant decrease in blood flow in the 
skin, muscles, brain, small intestine, kidneys, adrenal glands, 
and diaphragm. In the control animals, ouabain infusion induced 
an increase in aortal pressure, end-diastolic pressure, and 
general peripheral resistance and a decrease in heart rate but 
no statistically significant changes in their regional 
hemodynamics. In the embolized rats, ouabain infusion resulted 
in an increase in aortal pressure, cardiac output, and 
myocardial contractility and in a decrease in end-diastolic 
pressure. Significant increases in blood flow in the embolized 
rats' skin, brain, small intestine, lungs, liver, kidneys, and 
diaphragm and a decrease in vascular resistance in their lungs 
and diaphragm were also observed. The heart rate increased in 
five of the embolized rats and decreased in the other two. Of 
the total amount of microspheres injected into the rats, 34 +/- 
8 percent (i.e., 106,278 +/- 23,720/g) ended up in the heart as 
a whole. These findings confirmed that 21 days after 
embolization, rats with symptoms of cardiac insufficiency (heart 
failure) induced by embolization of their coronary vessels are 
more sensitive to the glycoside ouabain than are rats with no 
symptoms of heart failure and that coronary vessel-embolized 
rats may therefore serve as suitable models for studying the 
status of a cardiovascular system with evolving heart failure.

  [Abstract] Peptide modulation of immune responses was 
studied in inbred CBA mice of both sexes (weight, 20 to 25 g 
each). Peptides obtained from the Organic Synthesis Institute of 
the Latvian Academy of Sciences in Riga were administered to the 
rats in doses of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 20 mg/kg. 
Talcin and its analogue rigin had the biggest immune-stimulating 
effect at all doses tested. As the dose of the said peptides was 
increased, the number of IgM antibody-forming and 
rossette-forming cells [RFC] also increased. When the tripeptide 
SKE was used, the maximum RFC formed at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and 
when vasopressin was injected, immune system stimulation only 
occurred at the lowest dose (0.001 mg/kg). A vasopressin 
analogue that did not contain the amino acid glycine in its 
structure increased the number of RFC in the mice only when 
administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg. An increase in number of RFC 
(by a factor of 1.5) was also discovered in mice receiving 
substance P and its analogue. Among those peptides with an 
immune-suppressing function, the vasopressin analogue tripeptide 
IOS [expansion not given] manifested the greatest 
immunosuppressive effect. The specific effect of 
arginyl-asparagine appeared in a narrower dose range. As the 
dose in which it was administered was increased, the 
oligopeptide SKD manifested a strong immunosuppressive effect 
and proved capable of affecting the nervous and immune systems 
simultaneously. The immunomodulating capabilities of the 
aforesaid peptides were associated with the presence of amino 
acids such as arginine, lysine, tyrosine, and glutamic acid in 
their chemical structure.

  [Abstract] A new systems approach to studying the effect of 
psychotropic agents on the training process was proposed. The 
approach revolved around a multiple-parameter recording method 
that entailed recording seven behavioral indicators and 
processing them by using original mathematical programs based on 
pattern recognition theory and data analysis theory. The 
proposed systems approach to evaluating the effects of 
psychotropic agents on the training process called for recording 
the following behavioral indicators: number of correct 
responses, their latent period, number of responses to pain 
stimuli, speed of response to them, number of interstimulus 
responses, number of nonpurposive responses, and amount of time 
for which the animal was able to maintain itself on the 
crossbar. These seven indicators were analyzed in strict 
accordance with the animals' two possible states (response to 
light and failure to respond). After primary data processing, 
the seven series of starting indicators were transformed into 20 
derivative indicators associated with the response and failure 
to respond to light. Those data were then transformed into a 
three-dimensional matrix of indicators. The matrix was analyzed 
to develop a set of 8-10 diagnostically significant symptoms 
that were then used to characterize the animals' training curve 
based on N time points. The proposed systems analysis method was 
used to examine the effect of daily injections of 
D-9-tetrahydrocannabinol [D-9-THC] in a dose of 2 mg/kg on 
animals' ability to learn a conditioned response to light. The 
behavior of the animals receiving the D-9-THC injections was 
compared with that of animals that received daily injections of 
a physiological solution. The animals in the first experiments 
performed established that daily injections of D-9-THC improved 
study animals' ability to execute conditioned responses and 
lengthened the latent period of their conditioned response, did 
not change their latent period of response to pain stimuli, did 
not change the length of time for which the animals were able to 
remain on the crossbar, and increased the number of 
interstimulus reactions and nonpurposive reactions. The ability 
to execute the conditioned response improved gradually in both 
groups of animals; however, the behavioral strategies used by 
the animals in the two groups differed. The animals that 
received the D-9-THC appeared to rely less on information stored 
in their long-term memory, and the role of the emotional 
component in their decision-making process increased slightly as 
compared with that in the control animals. Figures 2; references

  [Abstract] Capsaicin is a naturally occurring 
physiologically active substance that has until recently 
remained little studied despite the fact that it is used widely 
in everyday life and in medical practice. Studies conducted in 
the past few years have demonstrated that capsaicin reacts with 
the C-fibers of the autonomic nervous system, facilitates the 
removal of substance P from the latter, and thereby lowers a 
patient's sensitivity to pain. Capsaicin has also been shown to 
affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and smooth 
musculature. Toxicity studies have established that capsaicin 
has a DL[.sub]50[/] of 1.1 to 120 mg/kg, guinea pigs being 
most sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] = 1.1 mg/kg) and hamsters 
being least sensitive to it (DL[.sub]50[/] &gt;  120 mg/kg). Its 
toxicity is highest when injected intravenously [IV] and lower 
when administered rectally or applied cutaneously. Three minutes 
after IV injection into Sprague-Dawley rats, capsaicin is 
already detectable in their brain, spinal cord, and liver in 
amounts several times higher than in their blood. When injected 
subcutaneously, capsaicin reaches its maximum levels in the 
tissues and blood after 5 hours. After 48 hours, rats that had 
received capsaicin in doses of 20 mg/kg had excreted 8.7 percent 
unchanged and in the form of eight metabolites. Capsaicin has a 
lasting antinociceptive effect. When administered in an aerosol 
(2-5 mol/l), capsaicin stopped coughing in test subjects 
without altering the depth or frequency of respiration. When 
used as an inhalant, it has been shown to increase the minute 
volume and average frequency of respiration. In anesthetized 
dogs, capsaicin injected IV in doses of 10 to 300 mg/kg has 
induced a short-term increase in mean arterial pressure followed 
by a long-term decrease. Its hypotensive effect in dogs and 
rabbits has been attributed to cholinergic mechanisms but not 
linked to any effect on the heart. Capsaicin has also induced 
relaxation of an isolated band of porcine coronary artery that 
was accompanied by hyperpolarization of the smooth muscle only 
in the presence of endothelium and has had various effects on 
isolated segments of guinea pig ileum depending on the 
concentration in which it was administered. Capsaicin's main 
targets are the central and peripheral nervous systems. When 
injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs in doses of 0.125 to 
0.15 mg, it attenuates behavioral responses to irritants in 
areas such as the eye and nose. Practical application of 
capsaicin is based on its predominant reaction with the 
peripheral receptors of formations of sensory nerves. It is 
highly selective, and it maintains its stimulating properties 
when diluted to concentrations as low as 1:11,000,000.

  [Abstract] The effect of normase on indicators of lipid 
peroxidation in cases of toxic liver injury was studied in a 
group of nonpedigree male albino rats weighing 170 to 250 g in 
which toxic liver injury had been induced by 3 days of 
intramuscular injection of a 50 percent oil solution of carbon 
tetrachloride (2 ml/kg). The metabolism of tetrachloromethane 
occurring in the endoplasmic reticulum of the hepatocytes was 
accompanied by the formation of free radicals inducing lipid 
peroxidation and subsequent development of hepatosis-hepatitis. 
The rats were injected with normase in 1-ml doses once daily for 
3 days. The intensity of free-radical oxidation was determined 
by the concentration of malonic dialdehyde [MDA] in their liver 
tissue, brain, and erythrocyte membranes. The data were 
subjected to standard analysis of variance methods and Student's 
t-test. As expected, tetrachloromethane induced 
significant accumulation of MDA in the substrates studied: The 
induced level in liver homogenate exceeded the starting levels 
by 116 percent, that in the animals' brain tissue exceeded the 
starting level by 59 percent, and that in their erythrocytes 
exceeded the starting levels by 93 percent. The concentration of 
SH groups in the said tissues decreased by 33, 34, and 38 
percent, respectively. Normase was not found to have any direct 
effect on the mechanism of primary liver injury. It did not 
change the activity of free-radical oxidation in hepatic tissue; 
however, it did facilitate normalization of the parameters of 
lipid peroxidation in the membranes of the study animals' 
erythrocytes and in their brain tissue. Tables 2; references 14:

  [Abstract] This article studies the effect of new nootropic 
action substances, nooglutil 
(N-(5-hydroxynicotinoil)-L-glutaminic acid, OHK-10) and 
piracetam, on the initial stages of the formation of various 
types of operant behavior in rats, namely avoidance learning in 
a shuttle box and a Skinner box, and on the T-maze reflex with a 
water reward. Comparison with data obtained from the three 
methods permitted differential evaluation of the effects of the 
drugs on learning. Nooglutil and piracetam have no effect on 
avoidance learning in a shuttle box or on the T-maze reflex. In 
a Skinner box, nooglutil accelerated the formation of the escape 
and avoidance responses, while piracetam improved only the 
escape response. The reason for enhanced performance in a 
Skinner box is that the inherent worsening of performance due to 
ambiguous cause and effect relations is countered by the 
nootropic drugs. Nootropic drugs have no effect on the formation 
of memory pathways in conditions that are not accompanied by 
functional disruption of higher nervous activity in both 
positive and negative reinforcement. Figure 1; table 1;

  [Abstract] Derivatives of 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine 
(ipsapirone and campirone) injected intraperitoneally or into 
the dorsalis nucleus raphe and dorsalis hippocampus of rats 
revealed dose-dependent anxiolytic action in avoidance procedure 
and conflict situations. Microinjections administered locally 
into the nucleus raphe and hippocampus revealed the role of the 
serotoninergic mechanisms of these brain formations in the 
studied anxiety conditions of varied aversive genesis. 
Injections of ipsapirone and campirone into the nucleus raphe 
elicited anxiolytic effect in various types of tests. Chemical 
stimulation of the hippocampus elicited an anxiolytic effect in 
several (ipsapirone) or isolated (campirone) tests. Dissociation 
of anxiolytic effects in tests of differing aversive genesis, 
due to the introduction of 5-OT and its agonists into the 
nucleus raphe and hippocampus, may indicate the ambiguous 
neurochemical effect of these substances, and the presence of a 
non-serotoninergic component in the mechanism of anti-anxiolytic 
action of derivatives of 1-(2-pyramidinyl)-piperazine. Tables 2;

  [Abstract] Earlier the authors had synthesized new 
biologically active tetrazole derivatives that turned out to 
have radiation protection properties. Continuing their search 
among tetrazole derivatives for new radiation protectors the 
authors obtained 27 different (2)-aminoalkyl-5-substituted- 
aryltetrazoles identified as I-XXVII. Their properties are 
presented. Also presented are toxic and radiation protection 
properties for N[.sub]2[/] isomers and their salts. Nine 
derivatives exhibited a 40-80% radiation effect under an 
LD[.sub]05-99/30[/] exposure. A relationship between their 
structure and action was observed. The most detailed study of 
radiation protection properties was conducted for compound XIV. 
It maintains its protection properties for 3 hours after 
exposure. Chemical and biological experiments were performed. 
The obtained data indicate that tetrazole class is promising in 
a search for radiation protectors. Tables 4, references 9.

<F P=106> [Article by Academician N. Laverov: ``It Is Time To Rid </F>
Ourselves of the Illusions That Someone Wants To Help Us. We 
Continue the Discussion on the Problems of Basic 
Science''--first paragraph is RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA introduction] 
  [Text] First of all about competence. Do you remember the 
incident with the Armenian Nuclear Power Plant? After the 
earthquake in Armenia the question of what to do with the 
nuclear power plant arose. The situation was an extremely 
complicated one. Serious damages, casualties, but here a nuclear 
power plant was operating near by. The governmental group, which 
I was charged to head, should have made a decision on the fate 
of the plant. 
  We came to the conclusion that it must not be shut down. In 
the Politburo I and Ryzhkov for half an hour defended our point 
of view. This is recorded in the minutes. But all the same it 
was shut down ``at the request of the working people.'' Now they 
are opening it again. If the leaders of that time had found in 
themselves the courage and boldness to heed the opinion of 
scientists and to follow our advice, Armenia, without a doubt, 
would have been spared many troubles. 
  The conclusion is simple: Earlier, unfortunately, they also 
did not always take into account the position of scientists. And 
now the situation with this is, in my opinion, simply rotten. 
And the present state of science is a clear example of this. It 
is impossible to build a new, developed, democratic society 
without scientific support. But what is happening in our 
country? Remember what the ancients said: ``While listening to 
the words, look at the deeds.'' 
  We, it seems to me, should understand that we are already 
living in a different society, but are still thinking in old 
categories. Here we swear at the state and demand that it give 
us money. But from where is it to get it? The debt of the state 
comes already to tens of trillions of rubles. If we are to give, 
hence, we are to take it from someone. But we see only our own 
problems. This is understandable, but, it seems to me, precisely 
scientists should now begin to actively suggest means of getting 
out of the crisis. Who, if not we? For it is clear to everyone 
that if they give money today, tomorrow the same problem will 
arise. A fundamental settlement of the question is necessary, 
and I am afraid that all our corporate claims--of the 
intelligentsia, the workers, the peasantry, the service 
sphere--in the attempt to survive are merely aggravating the 
situation. 
  Because of the nature of my job I regularly visit the most 
different enterprises. Recently I returned from the Arkhangelsk 
Lumber and Paper Combine, the largest in Russia. It is 
completely idle. Ukraine owes it 6 billion rubles. It is clear 
that it will never pay it them. This is hundreds of workers and 
their families. Other enterprises are also idle. 
  Now we should ourselves make, but without any political 
cunning, a truthful diagnosis. Have they collapsed completely or 
now yet? If they are in a complete coma, think about that to do 
under the conditions of a coma. But everyone is afraid to speak 
the truth. It turns out like it did with the Armenian nuclear 
plant. But we will all the same have to make this diagnosis. 
  I have repeatedly talked about this to members of the 
government. Whereas earlier there was no policy in the state in 
the area of science and technology, now everything has been 
aimed at the destruction of the sphere of science. The 
allocations for science have been reduced according to my 
estimates by a factor of 30. But if this is not the destruction 
of science, what is it? 
  For me it is absolutely clear, and I think it also is for 
all 
of you, that under the conditions of such a gigantic deficit it 
is time to specify national priorities. And to speak frankly 
about this to everyone. We will develop agriculture and power 
engineering, because without food and light it is impossible to 
live, but we will close down science. May it not suffer. But 
without science it is impossible to built a bright future. Here 
I would also wish that there were no illusions. 
  I personally believe that it is necessary by and large to 
talk not only about the Academy of Sciences. It is necessary to 
talk about the entire sphere of science: sectorial, VUZ, and 
defense. We all represent, after all, a unified complex. We are 
saving basic science, but who will convert our knowledge into 
specific technologies or pass it down to future generations? We 
cannot saves ourselves on our own. 
  There is another thought. In 1966 we developed a unit for 
superdeep drilling. It reached a depth of 13 kilometers. The 
Germans with their machine building, which is famous throughout 
the world, cannot develop such units. I am saying this, and 
there are innumerable examples, because we have in domestic 
science a large number of our own priorities, which are in the 
leading positions. Just as the state as a whole needs to 
determine its position with priorities, so each sector and 
science, in particular, needs to go through all its archives, to 
analyze the state of affairs and to say both honestly and 
openly: We will develop and support this. And this we will put 
off to better times. 
  I would like particularly to emphasize the attitude toward 
us 
of the world community. I have a serious report of foreign 
analysts, which is devoted to the state of Russian science. The 
conclusions there are interesting. The main thing is: Russia is 
living beyond its means, it is incapable of supporting such 
science, and the RAS should be reduced by two-thirds. Applied 
science should be converted completely to financing at its own 
expense. This report was prepared by experts of the European 
Economic Community on the order of our Ministry of Science. 
  Roughly speaking, it is simply suggested to us that we lie 
in 
a coffin and in addition independently drive the nails into its 
cover. They are suggesting that we do this, with our own money, 
without blinking an eye. 
  The conclusion is one from my numerous contacts with foreign 
structures. They did not help to help us and will not. They are 
calmly watching us fight in the grip of our own problems, and 
are giving advice on how we are to die subsequently. The 
solution lies only in reliance on ourselves. It has turned out 
historically that in our country science is monolithic and 
unified. We are not bound to the West. Its own advantages and 
disadvantages exist here. Thus, we are obliged today to use the 
advantages. It is time to rid ourselves of the illusions that 
someone wants to help us. For the present it is only in words. 
  I want particularly to emphasize the role of the 
contemporary 
press in the current fate of science. Earlier in every 
self-respecting newspaper and journal there was without fail its 
own department of science. For better or for worse they did 
their job: They educated, popularized, raised the prestige of 
scientific labor, and, when necessary, criticized. There was at 
least some link of science and society. Without it neither the 
state nor science itself can develop normally. 
  Now, as far as I know, all the departments have been 
eliminated. Pseudoscience: fortune tellers, clairvoyants, 
astrologers, and flying saucers, have replaced science. On the 
threshold of the third millennium we are rapidly sliding into 
the abyss of ignorance. But this is the road to nowhere.

  [Abstract] The present work is a continuation of a study of 
the synthesis of regular nano-structures on the surfaces of 
solid matrices as possible materials for nano-electronics and 
its study using scanning tunnel microscopy. Pyrographite plates 
were used as substrates in accordance with the specifics of 
scanning tunnel microscopy. Nanometer-size structures were 
formed on the surfaces by chemical modification of transition 
metals and phosphorus with halogens. The first results indicated 
that pyrographite treated with vanadium oxychloride had the most 
structure ordering. Therefore, the present work was devoted to 
studying the surface composition of vanadium 
oxychloride-modified pyrographite using X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the carrier gas used 
(air, nitrogen, or helium) plays a significant role in the 
concentration of elements on the surface layer as well as the 
shape of the V 2p[.sub]3/2[/], C1 s, O 1s lines in the 
photoelectron spectra. A comparative analysis of the spectra of 
modified pyrographite with the bulk oxygen compounds of vanadium 
led to the hypothesis on the structures formed on the 
pyrographite surface are similar in nature to that of hydrated 
vanadium oxide. The concentration and degree of polycondensation 
of surface structures are determined by the oxygen content in 
the carrier-gas. Figures 3; references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] In a previous work, a mathematical model was 
presented for an individual respiratory device having a 
reciprocating type system of air movement. Another group of 
individual respirators employs a cyclic system, where the 
exhaled air passes through a layer of regenerative product into 
a breathing bag; on inhalation, the air passes from the 
breathing bag to the face mask. The advantage of the cyclic 
system over that of the reciprocating system lies in a lower 
temperature of the inhaled air and less respiratory resistance, 
thereby improving the ergonomic characteristics of the device. 
Due to the two-way passage of air through the regenerative 
product in the reciprocating devices, the regeneration process 
is intensified, and for this reason these devices received 
greater dissemination. However, this advantage holds only for 
relatively small devices. The proposed model may thus be used to 
determine which system of air movement is most effective in any 
given case. In the present work the model was expanded to 
include devices designed to the cyclic system of air movement 
and used to compare the two systems. Figures 2; references 2 
(Russian).

  [Abstract] The ecological use of carbon fiber sorbents for 
effective removal of toxic gases and vapors from atmospheric air 
has become pressing. Vapors of organic solvents, such as 
benzene, are present in the vented wastes of various chemical 
enterprises, and the study of the sorption dynamics of these 
compounds is essential for the development of sorption methods 
of air treatment and the design of ecological equipment. In the 
present work some results are presented on a study of the 
sorption dynamics of benzene vapors on carbon foam fibers. The 
lengths of the mass transfer zones, the unused layer heights, 
and the coefficients of protection for various through-put rates 
and benzene vapor concentrations were determined. The dynamic 
characteristics of the sorption process as a function of the 
vapor-air mixture were determined by Forsythe approximation of 
the data. Figures 3; references 10 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The need for treating electroplating effluents 
for highly toxic chromium (VI) ions is brought about by the high 
PDK (maximum allowable concentration) of this substance in the 
water system. Thus, the PDK for chromium is set at 0.1 mg per 
liter, while its actual content in the effluents is as much as 
13-100 mg per liter. The widely used electro-coagulating 
reagents used for this purpose fail to provide a high enough 
degree of chromium ion elimination. Ion exchange methods appear 
to be the most effective means of providing a high degree of 
water purification, especially that of fiber ionites which are 
characterized as having higher rates of adsorption and greater 
ease of regeneration, in comparison with resin forms. In the 
present work PAN-AN-1 and PAN-AS-1 are recommended as fiber 
sorbents for leaching out chromium (VI). These are analogs of 
anionite exchange resins AN-18 and AV-17, used for the same 
purpose. PAN-AN-1 is diethylamine modification of an 
epoxy-containing grafted copolymer of polyacrylonitrile fiber, 
and has a static exchange capacity for low basicity tertiary 
amines of 3 mmoles per gram. PAN-AS-1 is obtained by treating 
the above copolymer with trimethylamine. It contains high 
basicity trimethyloxypropylammonium groups in amounts to 1.3 
mmoles per gram. Anion exchange capacity of the ionites 
comprises 2 mmoles per gram. Tests show that these sorbents are 
effective in eliminating chromium (VI) from electroplating 
effluents. Figures 6; references 10 (Russian).

  [Abstract] In all industrially developed nations the 
nitrogen industry is related to ammonia and methanol production. 
Ammonia and other nitrogen compounds are used for the production 
of fertilizers which have an annual estimated production growth 
rate of 5 percent. About 70 percent of the world's ammonia 
production is derived from natural gas; the most 
energy-efficient method of producing technological feed gas for 
ammonia is catalytic conversion of natural gas with steam in two 
stages. In the first stage pre-treated natural gas is passed 
over a nickel catalyst in a tubular reactor heated with natural 
gas under conditions selected so that the residual methane 
content in the dry converted gas is 9-11 percent by volume. In 
the second stage the methane is converted with steam and air 
oxygen in a columnar reactor where the entire oxygen content 
reacts with hydrogen, methane, and oxides of carbon. Heating the 
mix to 1250-1280 C shifts the equilibrium to catalytic 
reaction of methane with the steam. The quantity of air supplied 
to the reactor is controlled so that the CO and H[.sub]2[/] 
to nitrogen ratio is 3.05-3.10 and residual methane is 0.3-0.5 
percent by volume. The next step in the production of 
technological feed gas is catalytic conversion of carbon 
monoxide to increase the hydrogen content, remove carbon 
dioxide, and methanize any residual oxides of carbon to give a 
nitrogen-hydrogen mixture for the ammonia synthesis stage. Owing 
to the sharp rise in energy costs, the problem of energy savings 
became acute for multi-ton ammonia production, especially in 
production of the technological feed gas. In the present work 
some results are presented on a theoretical analysis of various 
variants in organizing a technological scheme and simulating 
processes in basic reactors making it possible to uncover 
tendencies in the modernization of multi-ton aggregates for the 
purpose of lowering energy costs. One such variant could be 
lowering the temperature in the secondary reforming stage under 
conditions of selective methane combustion to 1200 C.

  [Abstract] Effective development of science and technology 
requires wide range information on research and experimental 
design works. Lack of such information is especially acute when 
priority objectives are concerned. Since progress in these areas 
is largely determined by the production of chemical reagents and 
ultra-pure substances, this requires a stream of the most 
diversified information. Information systems in chemistry occupy 
a special place within automated information systems due to the 
need for handling huge volumes of highly complex information. 
One of the major problems of chemists working on chemical 
reagents and ultra-pure substances is optimization in selecting 
a method for purification and the equipment design needed to 
provide a given degree of purity. Resolution of these problems 
within the framework of a developing expert system (scheme) was 
facilitated by the following: a) classification and 
systematization of existing information; b) development of an 
interface with the user, and development of program shell for 
the expert system; c) development of a system for comprehending 
the subject matter and the multiplicity of rules describing it; 
d) filling out a data base. In the present work some results are 
presented on the development of an expert system for analyzing 
methods of preparation and equipment design for 
ultra-purification that takes into account the physical chemical 
properties of the product and a required level of impurities. A 
multi-level systematization of the literature and an expert 
evaluation of purification methods was developed and a universal 
shell based on the FoxPro data base system was worked out. This 
enables development of expert systems in the technology of 
chemical reagents and ultra-pure substances that also provides 
the user with the opportunity to supplement and modify the data 
base if needed. References 11 (Russian).

  [Abstract] In the chemical industry the production of 
chemical reagents has a great affect on science and production 
in general and also largely determines the scientific potential 
and capability of producing new chemical products. The domestic 
industry puts out only about 20,000 chemical reagents, while 
some of the leading companies in the world produce as much as 
15,000 to 20,000 items each. This is because the technical level 
of domestic low-tonnage production fails to meet modern needs. 
The creation of a diversified low-tonnage production system by 
traditional methods is lengthy process that must be ecologically 
clean and thrifty in resources, while a large assortment 
stimulates production of a gamma of products at a single 
location. This makes it imperative to develop diversified 
chemical reagent production along the lines of a flexible 
production system employing specialized equipment modules. The 
present work discusses some general principles in synthesis in 
flexible production of chemical reagents based on the analysis 
of individual products, their properties, and effectiveness. The 
procedure for synthesis is presented in the form of a whole 
system consisting of three mutual sub-systems: a) automated 
analysis and synthesis; b) formation of a technological 
equipment park and development of equipment blocks and modules; 
c) building base structures and formation of 
structural-technological schemes. Figures 3; references 5

  [Abstract] High demand for ultra-pure arsenic preparations 
prompted interest in methods for obtaining them from various 
arsenic-containing compounds, such as trialkylarsenites. These 
compounds have also been proposed for use in preparing 
ultra-pure arsenic sulfide and arsenic trioxide, as well as 
metallic arsenic itself. In the present work the molecular 
structure and vibration spectra of trimethylarsenite were 
studied by gas phase electronography, IR- and Raman 
spectroscopy. The resulting molecular constants were then used 
to calculate the thermodynamic functions of the ideal gas state. 
Standard enthalpy of formation was calculated and the standard 
Gibbs energy of formation of trimethylarsenite from simple 
substances was determined. Figures 2; references 23: 16 Russian,

  [Abstract] It is well known that enterprises of the 
chemical industry emit various gases and vapors, many of which 
are toxic. In case of an accident the quantity of gaseous 
emissions may increase many-fold from run-off or fire. As a 
rule, during any significantly large-scale accident, explosion 
of a gaseous substance causes formation and dispersion of 
particles, splinters, bits, pieces, and fragments of the 
substance itself and the ground leading to contamination of the 
territory and its surroundings. Furthermore, pieces and 
particles exceeding a certain minimum size present a danger on 
impact with the personnel of the enterprise and any nearby 
inhabitants. It has been observed that during the explosion of 
bombs or artillery shells having compressed explosives, the mass 
of the fragments is on the order of one gram or less and their 
initial velocity is about 10[.sup]3[/] meters per second. 
Each particle is irregular in shape and represents a macro- or 
micro-structure of the disintegrated material. Many products of 
the chemical industry and the storage depots of explosive 
materials are located underground. Accidental explosions at 
these points could also be sources of harmful mechanical 
interaction and pollution. The present work is devoted to an 
analysis of certain characteristics of the impact of the solid 
phase of explosive emissions where it has been established that 
these impacts are one of the most frequently encountered 
traumatic factors. It was demonstrated that particles of less 
than 5 mm in radius descend at a rate of 40 meters per second 
and their maximum energy on colliding with a ground-level object 
does not exceed one Joule. Impact of such particles with living 
beings is not dangerous. Larger sized particles, however, could 
result in trauma of varying severity. Figures 2; references 8: 7

  [Abstract] One of the leading trends in research is the 
modification of coal-derived adsorbents with various additives, 
such as shale kerogen, liquid products of shale, and petroleum 
residues, which significantly enhance both their sorption 
properties and their selectivity in leaching out metals from 
solutions. The present work is a study of the relationship 
between the composition and nature of the charge in the 
preparation of adsorbents from coal with petroleum asphaltites 
and their by-products for the purpose of determining the most 
active form for the adsorption of arsenic from effluent water. 
An adsorbent, derived from coal dust and containing 8 percent 
moderately concentrated asphaltite (66 percent asphaltites), was 
found to have a sorption capacity to extract arsenic from 
effluents that is 1.5-1.8 times greater than the best foreign or 
domestic products. References 7: 5 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] Many branches of modern industry require higher 
standards in the quality of material surfaces. This is 
especially true for electronics where it is the surface itself 
that often provides the required physical effects and operating 
conditions in micro-circuits. The status of a prepared surface 
is determined by depth of the treated layer, roughness 
parameters, optical cleanliness, lack of defects and structural 
wholeness of the treated material during the finishing and 
super-finishing processes. Highly perfected surfaces of optical 
and semiconductor devices are obtained by chemical-mechanical 
polishing methods. These methods are based on using polishing 
compositions which include colloidal non-abrasive particles in a 
solid phase acting as carriers of certain functional groups 
which react chemically with the treated surface. The liquid 
phase contains a combination of chemically active additives 
which regulate the chemical, transport, and mechano-chemical 
processes in the system polisher-polishing composition-treated 
material. Colloidal systems based on ultra-dispersed amorphous 
spherical modifications of silica particles (aerosils) proved to 
be effective. However, there are limitations in the use of 
aerosils in these compositions resulting from the insufficient 
chemical stability of the silica particles in certain chemically 
active media, and the insufficient hardness of the silica 
particles. In the present work the properties of a new class of 
ultra-dispersed materials, clustered diamonds made by detonation 
synthesis (ultra-dispersed diamonds) were examined. A study was 
made of their chemical stability in corrosive media, surface 
properties, morphology and aggregation, and a technology for 
preparing polished surfaces with them was developed. Polishing 
compositions containing these diamonds and a liquid medium such 
as water, mono- and poly-hydric alcohols (glycerine, ethylene 
glycol), were tested in the super-finishing of semiconductors 
(silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide), optical crystals, metals 
and alloys, and gemstones. The polishing resulted in 
high-quality surfaces lacking in defects such as scratches, 
fissures, or etching residues and having roughness parameters of 
1-2 nm. References 8 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Fabric-type contact devices are a new type of 
device capable of operating over a wide range of gas loads in 
the auto model valve-capillary mode. Hydrodynamic 
characteristics and contact phase surface formation mechanism 
were studied in a previous work, and their high efficiency as 
compared with traditionally used mass transfer columns in 
contact devices of the bubble type has been demonstrated. In the 
present work the operating efficiency of fabric-type contact 
devices was evaluated in relation to basic hydrodynamic process 
parameters of the desorption of carbon dioxide from water with 
air. A mass transfer mechanism is proposed which is based on the 
existence and mutual effects of two types of contact surface 
phases having different restoration mechanisms. The mechanisms 
and formulas were confirmed experimentally. Figures 3; 
references 6 (Russian).

  [Abstract] The objective of the work was to obtain new 
information on the composition and property of the surface layer 
of binary metal melts containing iron, cobalt and nickel, which 
form the basis of most composite materials for structural and 
tool applications. Experimental data necessary for analyzing the 
surface layer of the studied melts are presented in a table. The 
obtained data make it possible to assume that for iron metals 
family based melts with negative deviation from perfection a 
monatomic model of thickness of the surface layer is correct. 
For melts with positive deviation the model of a variable 
thickness surface layer is correct. But for the most important 
concentration region from 0 to 0.05 of molar share the monatomic 
model is applicable. It is concluded that in the case of metal 
melts of systems with positive deviations from perfection the 
surface layer is more perfect in terms of its behavior than the 
volume of the melt. Figures 4, tables 1, references 19: 11

Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, (Chernogolovka)] under 
the ``Research Methods and Properties of Powder Materials 
rubric''; received May 12,1993; UDC 539.2:620.7.018.45] 
  [Abstract] The article attempts to summarize information on 
physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties of 
nanocrystalline refractory compounds (RCs), mainly powder 
nanocrystalline materials (NMs) carbides, borides, nitrides, 
oxides etc. in consolidated state. Data on film NMs are provided 
for comparison. Data on hardness, which is among the most well 
studied characteristics, are presented, along with manufacturing 
methods, and analyzed. Residual porosity affects hardness: a 
5% 
TRiTchange of porosity changes its hardness by almost 50%. 
Hardness also depends on grain size. There is a real possibility 
of creating new superhard materials based on nanocrystalline 
RCs, but it is necessary to find a reasonable consolidation 
methods that will make it possible to obtain NMs with the 
optimum grain size. The failure mechanism of such materials 
remains virtually unknown. Information of the nature of grain 
TRvTboundaries in NMs is mainly available for TiOCCDDCC2DD. The 
boundaries are similar to those in regular large grain 
materials. One of the most interesting characteristics of 
refractory compounds based NMs is their superductility, but 
studies of this phenomenon are in a rudimentary state. Data on 
properties of nanocomposites have appeared in literature. Few 
works deal with physical and physico-chemical properties of RCs 
in nanocrystalline state. Among possible new applications of 
nanocrystalline RCs is the technology of nanocrystalline hard 
alloys WCCo with high hardness and wear resistance for making 
microtomes and other critical products. It is concluded that 
only first steps have been made in studying properties of 
refractory compounds based NMs. Figures 3, tables 2, references

  [Abstract] A Nd-glass laser set for thermonuclear fusion 
consisting was built and tested, a set consisting of a master 
oscillator and two successive amplifier stages with phase 
conjugation and pulse compression. The oscillator operates in 
the single longitudinal mode and single transverse mode. The two 
amplifiers operate in the four-pass mode. The beam emitted by 
the oscillator in pulses of 3 mJ energy and 25 ns duration 
passes through a x10 magnifying telescope, a 12x12 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture stop, and then two Faraday 
isolators before entering the first amplifier stage. The active 
medium here is a cylinder of neodymium glass 20 mm in diameter 
and 300 mm long. This preamplifier stage includes a cell filled 
with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, where an SBMS (Stimulated 
Brillouin-Mandelshtam Scattering) mirror for phase conjugation 
is formed by a focusing lens with a 50 cm focal length. After 
four passes in this stage and with the energy of radiation thus 
having been boosted to 3-4 J, the beam proceeds through a x3.3 
magnifying telescope, a Faraday isolator with a 60x60 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture, and then a x2.5 magnifying 
telescope before entering with a 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] 
aperture the second amplifier stage. The active medium here is 
an array of six slabs of neodymium glass 340 mm long with a 
20x120 mm[.sup]2[/] large cross-section each. They are 
optically pumped by seven rows of four IFP-5000 flash lamps 
between each two slabs, distilled water thermally insulating the 
slabs from these lamps. Each slab is followed sends radiation to 
a cell filled with Ar + SF[.sub]6[/] mixture, an SBMS mirror 
for phase conjugation in the pulse compression mode being formed 
in each by a 17 mm[.sup]2[/] large square lens with a 5 m 
focal length. Upon entering this second amplifier stage, the 
beam is thus split into six separate partial beams with a 17x100 
mm[.sup]2[/] large aperture each. It then leaves this stage 
with an about 100x100 mm[.sup]2[/] large compound aperture, 
the duration of radiation pulses having in this stage been 
shortened 20 ns to 2 ns duration. The energy reflectivity of the 
mirrors here is estimated at 50 %. Two tests were 
performed: 1) 
with direct passage of the beam passage through the second 
stage, 2) with reflection of the beam first by only one lateral 
face of each slab and then by their both faces. Direct passage 
was found to cause breakdown of the active medium near the 
lateral faces of the slabs, but radiation pulses of 20-25 J 
energy were nevertheless coming from each slab. Reflection by 
one lateral face resulted in a more uniform distribution of 
radiation intensity over the beam cross- section and reflection 
by both lateral faces resulted its most nearly uniform 
distribution. In the latter case the divergence of the total 
radiation beam was smaller than 0.1 mrad, while the energy of 
radiation pulses from each slab still reached the 25 J level. 
Such a laser set can be modified for simultaneous radiation 
emission at two different frequencies. This can be achieved by 
splitting the beam into two in the preamplifier stage, using a 
device such as a Fresnel biprism, and directing each half- beam 
to a different SBMS mirror cell: one containing a compressed gas 
and one containing a solid substance. Then while the beam is 
being focused, a traveling interference pattern will form in the 
focal plane owing to different radiation wavelengths in the two 
half-apertures. Figures 3; references 3.

  [Abstract] The performance of a two-frequency YAG:Nd+++ 
laser with beat (frequency separation) modulation for 
communication systems and rangefinders is analyzed 
theoretically, assuming equal quality factors in both modes and 
a uniformly broadened amplification band when the gain excess 
over the the sum of cavity and exit mirror losses remains small. 
For specificity is considered a laser with the following 
parameters: half-width of upper level _g_= 3 kHz, unilateral 
half-width of amplification band &Ggr;= 200 GHz, normalized 
pumping rate _ee_= 1.0225, absolute frequency deviation D= 1 
GHz. 
The system of equations of kinetics has been solved numerically 
for the population inversion in each mode, the intensity of each 
mode, and the beat frequency as explicit functions of time in 
the case of linear sawtooth frequency modulation of one mode. 
With the aid of these data is now calculated the form of a 
compressed pulse and thus also its nonlinearity, whereupon the 
results are used for the design of a matching filter or 
correlational signal processor. The resolving power of a 
rangefinder operating with one such two-frequency laser is found 
to be theoretically the same as that of a rangefinder operating 
with two single-frequency lasers. Practically, however, it is 
much higher owing to the fact that here technical fluctuations 
are correlated and especially so at a 10[.sup]6[/] GHz/s or 
higher scanning rate with a pulse signal shortened to an 
approximately 5 ns duration. Figures 4; references 6.

  [Abstract] Earlier studies having indicated that gain 
limitation in electric-discharge CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers is not 
related to underexcitation by electrons but rather to 
insufficiently selective pumping of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules 
by the discharge into the 00[.sup]o[/]1 upper level, this 
evidence is explained theoretically on the basis of the 
temperature model referring to P-branch of the 00[.sup]o[/]1 
10[.sup]o[/]0 transition. The corresponding expression 
for the gain k with respect to the rotational lower-level 
quantum number J is analyzed, considering first the ideal case 
of the entire pump energy W expended either on excitation into 
the antisymmetric vibrational mode _n_[.sub]3[/] or on 
raising its vibrational temperature T[.sub]3[/] while the 
temperatures of the vibrational two other modes remain equal and 
constant (T[.sub]1[/]= T[.sub]2[/]= T. The dependence of 
gain k(J) on pump energy W is then governed by the 
X[.sub]3[/]= exp[-h_n_[.sub]3[/]/kT[.sub]3[/]] term (h- 
Planck constant, k- Boltzmann constant), the gain being maximum 
when X[.sub]3[/]= (_a_ + X[.sub]1[/]/2_a_ (X[.sub]1[/]- 
referring to the first vibrational mode, _a_= exp[2BJ/kT, B- 
rotational constant approximately equal for both levels). 
Assuming that T[.sub]3[/] is proportional to the pump energy 
W, when J= 20 the gain is accordingly maximum when 
T[.sub]3[/]  4880 K. Next is considered the real case of 
unequal and rising rather than constant T[.sub]1,2[/] 
temperatures, also saturation of T[.sub]3[/] temperature and 
dissociation of CO[.sub]2[/] molecules. The results of this 
analysis confirm that, indeed, the maximum attainable gain in 
any kind of CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and the corresponding 
T[.sub]3[/] temperature on the degree of selectivity with 
which CO[.sub]2[/] molecules are being excited. Figures 2; 
references 21.

  [Abstract] Use of a fluorescent lidar with an excimer laser 
for measuring from a distance the thickness of films of 
petroleum products on water is considered, determination of the 
film thickness involving as usually two measurements of the 
fluorescence intensity of water twice: with and without the 
film. The principle of this method is based on the dependence of 
the hydrooptical properties, reflectivity and absorptivity, on 
the film thickness. These relations were studied experimentally 
with an XeCl-laser exciting the films with 308 nm radiation. 
Both absorption and emission spectra of various petroleum 
products, lubricants and fuels in cyclohexane solution, were 
measured in a spectrophotometer. The fluorescence intensity of 
such films on water was measured with a laboratory apparatus 
which included this XeCl laser and an aligning it He-Ne laser, 
two photomultipliers, a pyroelectric radiation receiver, an 
MDR-4 monochromator with a spectrally 2 nm wide slit, and four 
objectives consisting each of a mating biconvex and 
concavo-plane lens pair. A rotating wedge diverted a part of the 
excitation beam through either the first objective into the 
first photomultiplier or through the second objective into the 
pyroelectric radiation receiver. A right-angle prism reflected 
the remaining part of the excitation radiation through the third 
objective into the test cell with a specimen. A rotating plane 
mirror reflected the radiation from the fluorescing specimen 
through the fourth objective and then the monochromator into the 
second photomultiplier. Tests were performed on successively 
3-9-15-30 m thick films, with an XeCl-laser emitting 
radiation in pulses of 30 mJ energy and 30 ns duration at an 
either 0.1 Hz or 0.25 Hz repetition rate. Fluorescence was 
recorded within the 320-410 nm band, the maximum fluorescence 
signal shifting farter into the long-wave region as a light 
petroleum product was being replaced with successively heavier 
ones. With increasing film thickness, the fluorescence signal 
normalized to the Raman scattering signal was found to increase 
up to the fluorescence saturation level. Therefore, use of an 
excimer laser is recommended only for thin (d &lt; 15 m) 
films 
of petroleum products on water. Figures 3; references 9.

  [Abstract] Comprehensive studies of the environment 
covering specifically the populated territory of Armenia, had 
been made by these and other authors using optical methods. The 
purpose was to explore the interaction and interdependence of 
three factors: 1. ecological state of the still natural part of 
the geosystem, 2. human agricultural and industrial activity, 3. 
indirect transitory technogenic action on the geosystem. The 
method used in these studies was laser-fluorescent remote 
sounding of the earth surface and appropriate subsequent 
processing of the data. The conventional correlation coefficient 
was used for simplest and fastest rough identification of 
objects. Pattern recognition algorithms were used for a more 
informative but also more laborious identification of their 
spectra, which included use of four already known vegetation 
spectra as reference: 1. herbaceous monocotyledons, 2. 
herbaceous dicotyledons, 3. arboreal pinophyta (needle trees), 
4. arboreal magnoliophyta (leaf trees). Natural objects 
contributing to global transitory contamination of the 
environment, specifically rocky river beds and water basins 
forming along their paths, were of particular concern. The 
creation and evolution of these objects were simulated with the 
aid of aerial photographs, the role of geometric factors also 
being accounted for. The thus constructed ecological model is a 
rather universal model describing the physics of destruction of 
solid bodies and particularly of their breakdown by laser 
action. References 34.

  [Abstract] The principle of differential infrared 
absorption with scattering is considered for sounding the 
atmosphere and its contaminants, especially CFCl[.sub]3[/] 
(Freon-11) CF[.sub]2[/]Cl[.sub]2[/] (Freon-12), and 
CCl[.sub]4[/]. Inasmuch as TEA CO[.sub]2[/]-lasers are 
inadequate for this purpose owing to the presence of transverse 
modes and the decorrelating effect of the atmosphere along with 
instability of the radiation intensity and poor reproducibility, 
an ammonia-nitrogen 9-13 m laser with resonant pumping by a 
pulsed CO[.sub]2[/]-laser is proposed instead. The optics 
include three diffraction gratings: G[.sub]1[/] (100 
lines/mm, 30 glancing angle) on the exit side of the pump 
laser cavity, G[.sub]2[/] (75 lines/mm, 23 glancing 
angle) behind the first, G[.sub]3[/] (100 lines/mm, 30 
glancing angle) on the exit side of the NH[.sub]3[/]-laser. 
Pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/] laser impinges on the 
first grating, whereupon radiation leaving its zeroth order 
impinges almost normally on the second grating and then through 
its first order enters the cell with NH[.sub]3[/]. The 
optical cavity for this active medium is formed by a spherical 
opaque mirror with a 10 m radius off the optical axis in front 
and the third grating on the optical axis behind. The opaque 
mirror is positioned so that it reflects radiation emitted by 
the NH[.sub]3[/] laser onto the second grating, which then 
rereflects this radiation back into the cavity along with the 
pump radiation. Addition of nitrogen not only boosts the 
emission efficiency (to 20 %) and the energy of emitted 
pulses 
(to 1.5 J) but also appreciably widens the emission spectrum (up 
to 13.5 m). Absence of optically weak elements inside the 
cavity makes possible periodically-pulsed operation of the 
NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser. The laser is tuned by 
rotation of that third grating. Emission of 10-1000 ns long 
radiation pulses is achieved by passive locking of longitudinal 
modes. For measurement duty the system is modified and includes 
only two gratings. The first one (64 lines/mm, 31 glancing 
angle) tunes the pump radiation from the CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
to one of the two absorption lines of the sR(5,k) transition in 
ammonia and thus, with the aid of a compound cavity formed by 
that grating and two mirrors, splits that radiation into two 
beams of unequal intensities. The cavity of the 
NH[.sub]3[/]-N[.sub]2[/] laser is now formed by this 
grating, another mirror, and the second grating (100 lines/mm, 
37 glancing angle). This grating tunes the radiation from 
that laser to the absorption line of whichever contaminating 
impurity in air is being targeted, for use as the probing 
radiation. The system now also includes a transceiver into which 
the first grating sends both tuned pump radiation and tuned 
probing radiation, not together but in separate differently 
directed beams brought together into the transceiver upon their 
reflection by another mirror each. Figures 2; tables 1; 
references 11.

  [Abstract] Considering that stable radiation emission by a 
liquid laser requires a sufficiently large number of molecules 
in the active medium, a uniform distribution of the liquid over 
the emission zone, and a precisely aligned high-Q dispersive 
optical cavity, these conditions are applied to dye lasers 
featuring the best performance characteristics of all: not only 
wavelength-tunability over the 0.26-1.3 m range and up to 10 
kW power emission pulse but also compactness and cost 
effectiveness. When dye and solvent are being thoroughly mixed 
while being pumped by pulse trains of optical radiation, 
however, both hydrodynamic and photothermodynamic turbulence 
with attendant heat-induced convection of the solution will 
inevitably develop as the dye flow rate and the pump radiation 
intensity exceed the respective critical ones. The result will 
be randomization of the emission process with attendant lowering 
of both pump and laser efficiency. In search of a way to avoid 
this drawback, the dye excitation and lasing dynamics are 
analyzed for limitations on stable and efficient performance. As 
the main limiting factors are regarded not only both turbulence 
modes and thermal convection but also photodecay of dye 
molecules upon incidence of a pumping radiation pulse, their 
subsequent restoration, and the stroboscopic effect. As the 
optimum construction of the active element is selected a 
cylindrical cell with dye solution and a cylindrical mixing 
device inside. Thus are established the conditions under which a 
``window'' will exist in the dependence of emission irregularity 
on the dye flow characteristics and the pump radiation 
characteristics within which the emission process is least 
disordered, allowing a dye flow rate sufficiently high for 
stable replacement of dye molecules during the interval between 
pump radiation pulses. The relations established in this 
analysis indicate the feasibility of a laser with dye molecules 
in different instantaneous states and thus of wavelength tuning 
without a resonator. A rhodamine-6G laser pumped by a neodymium 
laser with second-harmonic 10 kW radiation pulses of 10 ns 
duration was designed and built. Tests revealed no turbulence 
throughout the 1.2x10[.sup]-7[/]-1333 l/s range of dye flow 
through the emission zone. References 8.

  [Abstract] The feasibility of achieving an excimer laser 
with a condensed active medium is examined for theoretical and 
experimental purposes. Inasmuch as most advantageous is 
transition of noble gases to a condensed phase and among all 
excimer lasers these lasers emit shortest- wave radiation, 
lasers, the most easily achievable Xe[.sub]2[/]-laser is 
considered for specificity. The first problem is avoiding 
absorption of emission-wavelength radiation under conditions of 
high gas densities. The solution of this problem is based on 
analysis of the known structure of lower energy levels and 
origin of molecular luminescence bands, also helpful being the 
known luminescence spectrum of crystalline solid xenon at 5 K 
temperature. The most difficult next problem is adequate pumping 
of the entire solid or liquid active medium, electric-discharge 
pumping being preferable to inefficient pumping by another laser 
and difficult to arrange pumping by a lamp. The necessary 
conditions for attaining a homogeneous electric discharge with 
sufficiently high energy for excitation of Xe atoms by electron 
impact are established by analyzing the drift of fast excess 
electrons through gaseous and liquid or solid xenon with 
attendant elastic scattering by its atoms. As the intensity of 
the electric field is increased above E*  _e_/b= 2 kV/cm 
for 
xenon (_e_- electron energy, b- mean displacement of electron 
prior to its thermalization), the energy lost by ``hot'' 
electrons during their collisions with Xe atoms is increasingly 
compensated by the energy imparted to the field so that the net 
loss becomes negligible in an electric field of intensity E 
&gt; &gt; 
E* (3 kV/cm for xenon). A solid Xe-laser constructed according 
to these guidelines has an H-form cell with already liquid xenon 
between two plane mirrors parallel to its two wide walls. Two 
electrodes,anode and cathode, are lining the cell wall on 
opposite sides along the narrow middle segment so as to produce 
a transverse electric discharge through xenon within this 
segment. No electron multiplication takes place in this system 
and use of an external electron source is inconvenient. Instead, 
for sustaining the discharge, the metal cathode is covered with 
a layer of a radioactive target material and a photoemissive 
coating of a high-yield (low work function) material on top. 
This ensures an electron avalanche by chain multiplication and 
thus makes it very likely feasible to build 30 kW lasers 
emitting ultraviolet radiation in pulses of up to 1 ms duration 
with an up to 30 % efficiency, not only Xe- lasers (172 
nm) but 
also Kr-lasers (145 nm) and Ar-lasers (128 nm). Figures 6;

  [Abstract] Electron-beam pumping of the wide-aperture 
excimer laser ``GARPUN'' [HARPOON] is being studied in search of 
a scheme which will ensure most efficient and nearly uniform 
excitation of the active medium. This laser, inside a 144 cm 
long chamber with a 22x22 cm[.sup]2[/] large square 
cross-section and a 18x20 cm[.sup]2[/] wide aperture, is 
pulse- pumped by two relativistic electron beams entering 
laterally from opposite sides through vacuum-sealed windows made 
of 20 m thick titanium foil, which separates the gaseous 
working medium inside from the beam accelerating vacuum diodes 
outside. The high-voltage beam accelerators consist each of four 
duplex shaping lines on deionized water which are electrically 
charged by a generator of voltage pulses. A pair of solenoids 
produces a pulsed magnetic field of about 1 kG intensity 
parallel to the counterpropagating electron beams which 
stabilizes the beams and minimizes diffusion of electrons from 
the active medium. This arrangement makes it feasible to form 
electron beams 12x100 cm[.sup]2[/] in cross-section carrying 
a uniformly distributed current of 60 kA behind the windows and 
delivering it in square pulses of 100 ns duration. The 
accelerating voltage is regulated by varying either the voltage 
of pulse generator or the geometry of interelectode gap in the 
vacuum diodes. The experimental apparatus includes a graphite 
calorimeter measuring the energy of both electron beams at the 
entrance to the laser chamber and a DMI-1 magnetic inductive 
instrument recording the pressure pulses in the active medium 
through an 8ANCh-23 strain-gage transducer on an S8-14 
oscillograph, the time constant of this set being 0.3 ms and 
thus much shorter than the about 200 ms long pressure transient 
inside the laser chamber. Tests were performed with 
Ar*[.sub]2[/] and Kr*[.sub]2[/] molecules, 0.1-0.6% 
CO[.sub]2[/] being added for effective quenching of the 
excitation states. The theoretical model of electron transfer in 
the one-particle approximation disregards collective effects and 
plasma instabilities, all being negligible under conditions of 
the experiment. Only pairwise collisions of electrons with atoms 
of the noble gas are thus assumed to take places during electron 
beam and active medium interaction, in the course of which 
either the atoms become ionized (excited) by the electrons or 
electrons are being scattered by the atoms. Radiation losses 
attending elastic scattering are in this case also negligible. 
Analysis of this process requires calculating the trajectories 
of individual electrons between successive collisions with atoms 
by solving the equations of motion dP/dt = e[vB] and dS/dt = v 
(momentum P= m[.sub]e[/]v/[1- 
(v/c)[.sup]2[/]][.sup]1/2[/], S- distance traveled by 
electron, e- electron charge, B- magnetic induction, 
m[.sub]e[/]- electron mass, v- velocity of electron, c- speed 
of light, t- time). This system of equations has been solved 
numerically by the universally applicable and most precise of 
all Monte Carlo method. The results of the experiment and of the 
numerical simulation indicate the optimum conditions for pumping 
an energy of as much as 2.1 kJ and correspondingly a power of 
about 0.8 MW/cm[.sup]3[/] density into a ``Garpun'' Ar-laser 
with an about 60% efficiency, with the energy 
distribution over 
the aperture deviating less than 20% from a uniform one 
and the 
overall pump efficiency reaching about 16%. The authors 
thank 
E.A. Molodykh for setting up he numerical calculations, A.A. 
Ionin and A.A. Kotkov for supplying the experimental apparatus 
and setting up the pressure measurements, V.G. Bakayev and G.V. 
Sychutov for assisting in preparation of the experiments.

  [Abstract] Construction of a Doppler wind lidar using a TEA 
(transverse excitation atmospheric pressure) pulsed 
single-frequency CO[.sub]2[/] injection laser for coherent 
reception and processing of data on winds in the lower 
atmospheric layers at altitudes up to 15 km. The design of such 
a lidar is based on the fundamental equation relating the 
signal-to-noise ratio to parameters of the sounding radiation 
pulses and of the atmospheric medium, the solution to this 
equation indicating the amount of energy needed for a sounding 
radiation pulse to reach the desired altitude. A laser set of 
this type with automatic ultraviolet preionization features both 
simplicity and reliability. Its one drawback is the sweeping of 
the emission frequency caused by presence of discharge electrons 
in the active medium, resonance polarization of CO[.sub]2[/] 
molecules, and acoustic expansion of heated gas. This sweep is 
best measured by optical heterodyning with radiation of a 
continuous-wave single-frequency reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser 
and subsequent mixing the two signals in a HgCdTe photodetector 
for processing with the aid of an analog-to-digital converter. 
The results of these measurements were used for optimizing the 
composition of the active medium so as to ensure both minimum 
width of the emission band and maximum emission energy. The 
active medium, a CO[.sub]2[/]:N[.sub]2[/]:He = 1.5:2.5:6 
mixture is confined inside a typically 5 m long linear resonator 
cavity, this cavity being formed by a spherical mirror with a 
typically 18 m radius and a germanium wedge. The cavity contains 
also a NaCl wedge through which an external signal is injected 
into the active medium and through which some laser radiation is 
extracted for mode locking. Mode locking is achieved by noting 
the instant of time at which the frequency of the injected 
signal coincides with the frequency of the natural cavity mode 
and at that instant initiating a discharge in the TEA 
compartment. This instant can be recorded by a signal peak 
detector as corresponding to the maximum intensity on the 
interference pattern, with the cavity mirror oscillating 
harmonically at a frequency of typically 180 Hz. Such a TEA 
CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a telescope were included in the 
prototype of a Doppler wind lidar, also a continuous-wave 
reference CO[.sub]2[/]-laser and a HgCdTe photodetector with 
an output amplifier, a DVK-2 computer, and a CAMAC crate. A 
model needed for determination of the signal scattering in the 
atmosphere is based on the following premises: 1. scattering is 
done by a large number of arbitrarily located identical aerosol 
particles moving at the wind velocity, 2. atmospheric turbulence 
influences only the wavefront of backscattered radiation, 3. 
signal attenuation in the atmosphere obeys Bouger's law. With 
this lidar were measured wind velocities along horizontal and 
vertical paths, whereupon he data were used for calculating wind 
velocity profiles and their dispersions. The authors thank 
Professor S.A. Akhmanov for initiating this study and then 
providing an comprehensive support, also G.A. Pogosov and L.A. 
Kosovskiy for support and helpful discussion. Figures 7;

  [Abstract] A novel emission mode of a free-electron x-ray 
laser with counterpropagating electron beam and optical pump 
laser (``optical wiggler'') beam, namely its quantum emission 
mode where emission of an x-ray quantum changes the electronic 
state appreciably, is analyzed by comparing it with its 
classical mode of operation. Interaction of relativistic 
electrons with both electromagnetic pump and signal fields, for 
simplicity assuming a collinear geometry. Such a laser with an 
optical pump differs from one with a conventional magnetostatic 
one in that its emission and absorption lines are completely 
separated so that the ratio = h/_D_|e of the distance h_o_ 
(h- Planck constant, _o_- frequency) between them to their 
effective width _D__e_ is _ee_ &gt; &gt;  1, while with a 
magnetic pump 
this ratio is _ee_ &lt;&lt; 1. Analysis of three-wave 
interaction 
confirms the validity of treating the laser as one with a 
completely inverted two-level active medium and describing its 
electron dynamics with the Klein-Gordon equation. By virtue of 
the conservation laws, the problem of transitions in a continuum 
reduces to the problem of resonance excitation of discrete 
levels in an anharmonic oscillator. This leads to a 
self-consistent closed nonlinear system of four partial 
differential equations completely describing the emission 
dynamics of such a laser: two equations the evolution of slowly 
varying amplitudes a[.sub]0[/](z,t) and a[.sub]-1[/](z,t), 
one equation the propagation of emission pulses, and one 
equation the evolution of the high-frequency signal. This system 
is analogous to the system of Maxwell-Bloch equations describing 
the interaction of a two-level atomic medium with a resonance 
field. The performance characteristics of this laser are 
calculated for the case of quasi-steady amplification with the 
durations of not only the high-frequency pump and signal pulses 
but also of the electron cluster much longer than the 
characteristic dimension of the interaction space divided by the 
speed of light. The laser is shown to be more efficient in the 
quantum mode than in the classical mode of operation, transition 
from the latter to the former being achievable by widening the 
energy range within the electron beam. References 24.

  [Abstract] Propagation of ultrashort light pulses through a 
dispersive nonlinear medium is analyzed, for simplicity 
considering only scalar electromagnetic waves. The analysis is 
based on the theory of coherent interaction in several 
approximations: 1. resonance, 2. unidirectional wave 
propagation, 3. slowly varying complex pulse envelope. Resonance 
may be assumed when the bandwidth of the pulses is much smaller 
than the resonance frequency. In this approximation the wave 
equation is supplemented with Bloch equations, the resulting 
Maxwell-Bloch system having steady-state solutions but no 
soliton solution. Unidirectionality may be assumed when the 
concentration of resonant atoms is sufficiently low for 
interaction of counterpropagating waves to be negligible. In 
this approximation that system of equations transforms into one 
whose soliton solutions describe gp-pulses and breezers with 
2-pulse envelopes. When the unidirectionality condition is 
not satisfied, then the nonlinear wave equation E[.sub],zz[/] 
- c[.sup]2[/]E[.sub],tt[/] = ... must be resorted to. This 
equation, obtainable from the same solutions to the Bloch 
equation and very similar to the Boussinesq equation, is 
completely integrable and has known multisoliton solutions. 
Approximation of a slowly varying complex envelope leads to the 
system of MacCall-Hahn equations, whose soliton solutions 
describe 2-pulses. In the approximation of a slowly varying 
envelopes of optical pulses and of medium polarization formal 
solution of the Bloch equation yields the nonlinear Schroedinger 
equation of nonlinear fiber optics. References 18.

  [Abstract] An unstable resonator is proposed for the 
LIT-100 commercial YAG:Nd laser. The active medium of this laser 
consists of two cylindrical YAG:Nd rods 100 mm long and 6.3 mm 
in diameter, a thermal lens being induced in each. They are now 
placed each inside a single-lamp ellipsoidal reflector-luminaire 
and each pumped with a 24 A - 150 Hz current supplying a power 
of 5.5 kW. These luminaires are very energy-efficient but, owing 
to multimode radiation emission by the active medium, they form 
a widely divergent radiation beam. Stable resonators in the form 
of long planar cavities minimize the beam divergence, but with 
an attendant loss of power caused by distortions of higher 
orders than those due to formation of the thermal lenses in the 
active medium. Unstable resonators operating on the negative 
branch of the stability curve are known to minimize the beam 
divergence with minimum energy loss. Two variants of such a 
resonator have been designed and tested. The telescopic 
resonator providing an M= -1.7 magnification has a cavity formed 
by two concave mirrors with respectively 0.67 m and 0.4 m radii 
of curvature, the latter having a 3.6 mm diameter. The focus of 
each mirror coincides with the focus of the nearest to it 
thermal lens, the two thermal lenses having the same focal 
length and the distance between them being equal to twice that 
focal length. This resonator forms a radiation beam similar to 
that formed by a ``cat's eye'' reflector and not much better 
than that of the LIT-100 laser. The other resonator has a cavity 
formed by two plane total-reflection back mirrors and an exit 
mirror with a hole smaller than 6.3 mm in diameter. The image of 
this hole, formed by the two thermal intracavity lenses, 
coincides with it and the radiation beam thus exits through it 
with hardly any loss of power. Such a resonator with 
self-imaging of the exit hole rendered the best performance when 
its critical dimensions were: 1. diameter of exit hole d= 5.2 
mm, 2. focal length of thermal lenses f= 1 m, 3. distance from 
focus of the thermal lens before the exit mirror to the nearest 
back mirror L= 0.74 m. With this resonator the laser delivered a 
power of 160 W (80 W per rod) in a beam with a 1.6 mrad 
divergence angle (at 86% maximum intensity level).

  [Abstract] The characteristics of aerospace instruments 
developed during the last 15 years at the NPO State Institute of 
Applied Optics are given and possible fields of their 
applicability are discussed. Among the instruments described 
(all accompanied by their pertinent technical specifications) is 
a high-resolution thermal imager for low-orbit satellites. 
Another is the ``Klimat'' IR radiometer which is part of the 
Meteor-3 meteorological satellite. This radiometer is used for 
the registry of thermal images and measurements of the radiation 
temperature of cloud cover and the surface (ice and snow cover, 
rivers and seas, forests and other natural formations). The 
high-resolution MSU-V multispectral scanner, a part of the 
``Okean'' space system, is used for observing the surface in 
eight spectral ranges. A multispectral pyrometer was developed 
for measuring energy brightness and surface temperature for 
constructing synoptic charts of thermal gradients and studying 
the radiation balance of the Earth and atmosphere from aboard 
the Mir orbital station. A hemispherical radiometer was 
developed for measuring terrestrial radiation fluxes and global 
temperature sounding of the atmosphere. Different kinds of 
thermal imagers also have been developed for aircraft and 
helicopters and are briefly described. Fuller descriptions of 
these instruments and systems are given in the cited literature.

  [Abstract] Work done at the Institute of Optophysical 
Research on the development of databases and mathematical models 
essential for reliable use of optoelectronic instruments carried 
by spacecraft or aircraft and for the reliable interpretation of 
the registered data is described. The information (measurement 
conditions, meteorological and actinometric data) incorporated 
in these databases is listed. The various programs written for 
use with these databases are given: for readout and conversion 
of the registered data from instruments having different forms 
of output signals; for referencing output signals to 
meteorological data; for data storage, correction and 
accumulation; for issuance of data summaries upon interrogation; 
for output of summarized tables or summaries of stored 
information for given spectral ranges or geographic regions. 
Such databases have been used in systems for simulating real 
conditions with allowance for the regional peculiarities of 
optical weather by applying synthesis principles. Work has been 
done on mathematical simulation of complex three-dimensional 
spatially extended scenes; the different stages in such image 
modeling are outlined. Mathematical models of this type make it 
possible to generate three-dimensional brightness images of 
different size; to determine shadows from solar coordinates and 
thereby to make adequate allowance for the distribution of 
terrain illumination; to transform the synthesized images to any 
observation conditions. In essence, this article represents a 
summarization of the materials covered in the listed 
bibliography and serves as an introduction to certain articles 
in this issue of the journal. References 14: 13 Russian, 1

  [Abstract] Methods for computing the characteristics of 
thermal imagers, especially their resolution, applicable to test 
objects in the form of line test patterns, which in some cases 
makes possible approximate extrapolation of the results to an 
evaluation of the possibility of identifying specific objects on 
the basis of empirical expressions, continue to be improved. An 
analysis is based on computation of the signal-to-noise ratio 
when resolving a three-element test pattern. A merit of this 
form of analysis is that it is possible to use analytic 
expressions for determining the intrasystem parameters of IR 
instruments from the measured values of the characteristics of 
the complex in which it is a component part when solving the 
direct problem or determining the characteristics of the complex 
from the measured values of the parameters of the IR instruments 
when solving the inverse problem. The proposed method for 
determining the probability of resolution makes it possible to 
evaluate the admissible design errors in IR instruments 
attributable to technological constraints. In accordance with 
the described method the probability of resolution of a three- 
element test pattern by an ensemble of aerospace instruments 
under ground conditions can be determined when using an 
experimental test stand (an annotated block diagram accompanies 
the text). This resolution is 0.8 for a spatial frequency of the 
mires _u_ = 0.0333 m[.sup]-1[/] and a radiation contrast of 
the scale and test pattern _D_T = 3 K. In this case the 
discrepancy between the experimental and computed data does not 
exceed 4%. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.

  [Abstract] The properties and advantages of optoelectronic 
instruments with a symmetric input are reviewed, including the 
author's initial work along these lines. However, the emphasis 
here is explanation of the theoretical and practical basis for 
the algebraic-geometric synthesis of the structure of two- and 
three-channel optoelectronic systems with a symmetric input 
involving the two geometric operations of shifting and rotation 
of the input transducers and six algebraic operations in the 
electronic channel. This makes it possible to obtain new 
synergetic functional capabilities -- the combining of system 
elements and components resulting in a considerably greater 
effect than with their simple addition, thereby achieving a 
considerably higher quality level. This ensures obtaining a 
linear zone of the output function with a prestipulated 
accuracy; control of steepness (response) and range of the 
output function from tenths of a unit to several thousands; 
invariance to the strength of the input signals; reduction of 
the errors associated with nonidentity of the channels by a 
factor of ten. Accordingly, the accuracy of three-channel 
systems is an order of magnitude greater than for two-channel 
systems. The practical introduction of this method in the 
designing and fabrication of various specialized instruments 
will make it possible to reduce their size and weight by a 
factor of 3-8, considerably enhance their useful life and 
reliability. References: 10 Russian.

  [Abstract] A study was made of the absorption spectra of 
some motor oils in the range 25...0.25 m, fluorescence 
spectra, excitation of the fluorescence of oils and their change 
in the course of their use in internal combustion engines. For 
the identification of these products it was necessary to define 
those spectral intervals in which considerable differences are 
observed in the spectra. There are no significant spectral 
differences for used and unused oils in the range 25...0.6 
m. 
Several types of spectrometers were used in studying the 
fluorescence spectra of different oil samples. Substantial 
differences in the absorption spectra of oils begin to be 
manifested only in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges. The 
fluorescence spectra of oils are very highly dependent on the 
wavelength of the exciting radiation. There also is a change in 
the form of the fluorescence spectra for used oil in comparison 
with pure oil. The greater the wavelength of the exciting 
radiation, the more are the fluorescence spectra shifted into 
the shorter-range region. A design of an instrument for 
determining the total quantity of petroleum products in water, 
accompanied by a block diagram, is briefly described. It is 
based on a nitrogen laser operating at a wavelength 337.1 nm.

  [Abstract] Experimental materials are given on the 
appearance of anomalous temperature contrasts of the ground 
surface over leaks from petroleum product pipelines. A gas surge 
under high pressure in the area of an underground leak, as a 
result of its expansion, cools the ambient soil volume and due 
to heat transfer at the surface forms a spot having a negative 
temperature contrast relative to the background. Measurements 
were made using an AGA-780 thermal imager-radiometer from aboard 
a helicopter hovering at an altitude 50-60 m. The results of 
specific observations are given. The factors governing the 
linear resolution of the instrument on the ground and the 
registered thermal contrast are discussed. Due to the great 
thermal inertia of the soil layer a considerable time elapses 
between the break and the appearance of a temperature contrast 
at the surface. The influence of ambient meteorological 
conditions on the degree of contrast is discussed on the basis 
of computed data. The factor exerting the greatest influence on 
spot contrast is wind speed. The depth of leak occurrence has a 
decisive effect on the thermal picture. The influence of time of 
day when observations are made (temperature and illumination) is 
analyzed pertinent to the middle zone of the country in clear 
summer weather. The maximum thermal anomaly over a leak site is 
observed from 1800 to 0800 hours when there are no masking 
thermal nonuniformities in the soil caused by solar heating.

  [Abstract] The human eye as a time and space filter is by 
no means an ideal integrator and this makes necessary a search 
for a more modern method for taking its integrating properties 
into account, including when observing moving objects. The 
traditional formula employed is not adequate for this purpose 
because it is assumed that the imager is fixed relative to the 
observed object and the angular dimension of its image does not 
exceed the region of spatial summation of the human eye (11.6 
mrad). An improved method is therefore proposed for taking into 
account the time and space integrating properties of the human 
eye when analyzing images transmitted by thermal imagery 
instruments and for eliminating the assumptions formerly 
introduced. The necessary formulas for this purpose are derived. 
It is shown that the traditional method is adequate for thermal 
imagers fixed relative to the observed objects when the relation 
between the equivalent dimension a of the object and the 
dimension of a thermal imager element q is a/q &lt; 5...6. In 
contrast, the proposed method, based on real, rather than 
idealized properties of the human eye, does not have these 
limitations and can be used when estimating the principal 
efficiency indices of thermal imagers for a broader range of 
conditions of practical interest. The method is suitable for 
such purposes as observing moving objects and (or) large-jarea 
objects. References 8: 7 Russian, 1 Western.

  [Abstract] The designing of laser sounding apparatus and 
evaluation of the efficiency of its use under real conditions 
requires that initial information be obtained on the reflective 
characteristics of underlying surfaces at laser wavelengths and 
their change under the influence of various factors. A 
goniophotometric apparatus for measuring the backscattering 
diagrams for samples of soils and vegetation and for water 
surfaces at laser wavelengths was developed. A diagram is given 
with 29 components identified, serving as a basis for a detailed 
description of instrument structure and functioning. It ensures 
measurement of the effective brightness coefficients in the 
range from 10[.sup]-4[/] to 10[.sup]4[/] with an error not 
greater than 20%. The results of measurements of sand, 
earth 
(clay loam) and mixed meadow grasses, as well as an open water 
surface and water with an oil film with a thickness 0.5 mm, at 
wavelengths 1.06 and 10.6 m are presented. The experimental 
data on the angular energy and polarization reflective 
characteristics of samples of underlying surfaces, in 
combination with simulation of the geometry and observation 
conditions of the macrosurface of extended terrain sectors, make 
it possible to synthesize their images and therefore to select 
the best parameters of laser sounding apparatus. Figures 3;

  [Abstract] A comparison revealed that of two portable 
optoelectronic instruments that with a scanner based on a 
12-facet prism with differently tilted facets and matched 
optical channels has advantages with respect to angular 
resolution, image quality and nonparallelism of the axes over an 
instrument with a scanner based on five pairs of two-mirror 
rhombi with separate IR- and visible-wavelength channels. The 
two compared instruments are the OEP-1 and the OEP-2. A table 
gives their comparative technical specifications; a block 
diagram of the first identifies 12 components and a block 
diagram of the second identifies 14 components. These two 
annotated block diagrams are used in a detailed discussion of 
instrument structure and functioning. The comparison of the 
experimental and theoretical performance of the two types of 
systems revealed that in the OEP-1 its energy potential is not 
fully realized due to the great diameter of the entrance pupil 
of the optical unit and the lesser _D_T[.sub]equiv noise[/] 
level. Moreover, its angular resolution is poorer than for the 
OEP-2 both due to the lesser focal length (153 vs. 170 mm) and 
due to special features of the scanner and the presence of 
separate channels, resulting in the worsening of angular 
resolution. The angular resolution of the OEP-1 could be 
increased by increasing its focal length, but that would 
considerably increase its size and weight. The OEP-2 can ensure 
greater linear scanning fields than the OEP-1, which makes it 
possible to use photodetectors with a greater number of sensing 
elements. Figures 3; references: 3 Russian.

  [Abstract] The development of highly reflective mirrors 
with small losses in scattering and absorption on the basis of 
multilayer interference coatings is discussed and the theory of 
nonpolarizing highly reflective mirrors is outlined. A method 
for designing and fabricating amplitude-phase anisotropic 
mirrors with small losses for operation at a wavelength 632.8 nm 
at an angle 45 is described in detail and copies of 
phase-controllable mirrors smoothly and reversibly changing 
phase anisotropy within the limits 10 also are described. 
Such a mirror is a backing of KU1 glass fabricated by deep 
grinding and polishing to whose working surface is successively 
applied (in a vacuum by the cathode-ray method) a current 
conducting layer, copper contacts for imparting a working 
voltage and the highly reflective mirror itself. The operating 
principle is as follows. With the imparting of voltages and a 
current of definite strength to the contacts the 
current-conducting layer causes heating of the mirror itself, in 
which the optical thicknesses of the layers change (these 
changes are proportional to the strength of the current fed to 
the contacts). With an increase in the current strength fed to 
the contacts the range of change in phase anisotropy increases 
with heating of the mirror to 80C. The dependence of phase 
anisotropy on temperature has a reversible stably reproducible 
character. Figures 4; references 12: 6 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] A laboratory goniophotometer has been developed 
for use in studying the angular reflective characteristics of 
plane surfaces of materials and coatings. The operating 
principle and the design of the instrument are described and its 
principal technical specifications are given. Hardware and 
software were developed which ensure the necessary operating 
modes and instrument automation, control of the measurement 
process and documentation of the results. A key part of the 
outfit is an IBM PC-XT personal computer with a universal 
controller. Programs ensure proper conditions for photometric 
measurement of the sample (changing the angular coordinate and 
direction of rotation of the sample relative to its initial 
position, supplying values of the accompanying angular 
coordinates, interval of change of angle and number of executed 
intervals), as well as implementation of the procedure of 
collecting and processing of measurement data and ensuring the 
proper number of readings to be used in averaging the signals of 
the photoreception system for attaining the necessary 
reproducibility of the results. The results in the form of 
scattering diagrams are represented on a display screen and are 
printed out. The results of study of the scattering diagrams of 
a rough metallic surface at wavelengths 0.65 and 10.6 m and 
MS14 milk glass at scattering angles 64 and 104 are 
compared. Figures 3; references: 7 Russian.

  [Abstract] Inspection of multimodular optical telescopes 
with a synthesized aperture for proper phasing by means of an 
achromatized diffractional hologram interferometer is proposed, 
the aim being to maximize the resolving power of such telescopes 
in terrestrial astronomical observatories. The scheme is 
demonstrated on a bimodular telescope with four smaller mirrors 
including the main one in each module and one common larger 
spherical concave mirror which synthesizes the exit pupil while 
forming the image of a star in its focal plane. The holographic 
system consists of a spherical concave collimating mirror and a 
hologram. It can operate with an either internal or external 
light source. In the former case the light source, a point 
source, is placed in the focal plane of a booster lens and the 
hologram is placed in front of the collimating mirror. The 
holographic system forms the inspecting wave, which is to 
``simulate'' the radiation entering both telescope modules upon 
arrival from a star within the middle of the field of view. The 
hologram is a plane mirror with a reflective diffraction 
grating, an equidistant array of lines, deposited on its active 
surface. Its spatial frequency has been selected so as to ensure 
that radiation in +1 and -1 diffraction orders will impinge on 
the main mirror of module ``+1'' and module ``-1'' respectively. 
Each of these mirrors is covered by a projecting reflective 
hologram with zero-order optical power and the same spatial 
carrier frequency. The collimating mirror and the holographic 
mirror can be combined a single reflective or transmissive 
hologram. A theoretical analysis of the inspection process, 
taking into the geometry of this scheme, indicates that 
decreasing the spatial frequency of the holograms will allow 
widening the tolerances on the telescope parameters. For 
verification, an experiment was performed using an incandescent 
lamp as the light source and diffraction gratings with 200 
lines/mm each. The hologram before the collimator was used as a 
measuring bridge and a Fourier objective with its optical axis 
passing through the center of that hologram was simulating a 
phased telescope with a synthesized aperture. Following 
appropriate adjustment of the three holograms in the focal plane 
of this objective, a high-contrast achromatic interference 
pattern was seen which remained stationary while the lamp was 
being moved in the focal plane of its booster lens. The author 
thanks D.N. Yeskov, S.A. Rodionov, V.S. Korepanov, A.G. Seregin, 
and V.I. Sidorov for steady attentiveness and fruitful 
discussion. Figures 3; references 8.

  [Abstract] Reconstructing the image of an astronomical and 
thus remote object seen through a distorting medium such as the 
atmosphere is considered, specifically reconstructing the phases 
of its spatial spectrum from closure phases obtained in one 
exposure. A spectrum phase can be completely determined from two 
interference patterns simultaneously recorded by two 
interferometers with angular shifts _a_ and 2_a_ 
respectively. 
These data are sufficient for determining the closure phases on 
three basises forming an isosceles triangle whose base is longer 
than its arms, each closure phase then representing a recurrence 
relation. One known reconstruction algorithm (F. Roddier, C. 
Roddier; OPTICAL COMMUNICATION, Vol. 60 No. 6, 1986) yields an 
exact solution to recurrence equations in the form of an 
infinite series on basis triangles shrinking toward the center 
of the aperture with coefficients forming a geometric 
progression, but gives no evidence about the convergence of this 
solution and about its immunity to noise in the input data. 
Another algorithm is therefore proposed which includes 
determination of the permissible noise level in the input data. 
First the plane of closure phases is constructed from the light 
intensity distributions on two interference patterns with /2 
and  angular shifts respectively. Next is formed the 
combination k(u,v)= _b_(u,v) + _b_(v,-u) + _b_(u+v,v-u) of 
bispetrum phases for reconstruction of the spectrum phases. The 
problem of reconstructing the image from noisy input data is 
solved by avoiding the inherent ill-conditioning of this 
problem, namely by reconstructing not the absolutely exact image 
of an object but the image most closely approximating it and, 
therefore, by using the optimally long k-series which will 
minimize the error at the given noise level. Both correctness 
and effectiveness of this algorithm are confirmed by a numerical 
experiment involving the image of letter T and the image of 
letter C with superscript ++ (C[.sup]++[/]). Figures 5;

  [Abstract] A major problem in development of commercially 
producible SQUID magnetometers operating at 77.3 K (liquid 
nitrogen) with a 20-30 fT.Hz[.sup]1/2[/] resolution at 
frequencies above 10 Hz has been selection of the substrate 
material most suitable for deposition of thin high-grade 
Y-Ba-Cu-O high-T[.sub]c[/] superconductor films. Conventional 
single-crystal substrates must satisfy several difficult to 
satisfy requirements: structurally compatibility with the film, 
a coefficient of thermal expansion compatible with that of the 
film, and chemical inertia toward the film material, in addition 
to matching degree of modularity and of its plane surfaces. A 
comprehensive study has yielded an alternative solution to the 
problem: a substrate with a bicrystalline structure with proven 
strontium titanate as the preferred material. This choice had 
been confirmed experimentally on the basis of quality control by 
optical and x-ray inspection methods. A thin high-T[.sub]c[/] 
ceramic film was grown on a heated substrate by the vapor 
deposition process from two rotating identical solid ceramic 
disk targets, which had been produced from the same mixture of 
Y,Ba,Cu oxides. The targets were placed at a right angle to one 
another and symmetrically at a 45 angle to the substrate 
(``on base of a right equilateral triangle''). They were 
vaporized by identical YAG:Nd+++ lasers operating in 
synchronism, the two also mutually orthogonal laser beams being 
focused each by a lens for normal incidence on the respective 
target. The vapors emanating from the targets were channeled to 
merge into one stream normally incident on the substrate 
oriented. Specimens of such a structure were examined under a 
polarization microscope. Measurements revealed a 2-periodic 
anisotropy of the reflection coefficient for polarized light as 
a specimen was rotated about the axis perpendicular to the 
substrate surface, the amplitude of this anisotropy being 
largest for light of 1 eV quantum energy and in this case 
obeying the Malus law. The structures were also tested for Raman 
scattering of light by the films. Interferometers built on such 
substrates were tested for response to intensity oscillations of 
an external magnetic field. Microbridges and quantum 
interferometers were formed by standard methods of optical 
photolithography. The critical current density in the direction 
across the seam of the bicrystal-substrate was found not to 
exceed a few kA/cm[.sup]2[/] and the critical direct current 
for thus produced Josephson junctions to be within the 30 A 
 I[.sub]c[/]  300 A range. Their current-voltage 
characteristic fitted the RSJ hyperbolic model, with blurring in 
the vicinity of the critical current caused by the fluctuation 
component of the junction current. A magnetometer containing 
such a d.c. interferometer connected into the appropriate 
electronic circuit had an energy resolution of 
3.1x10[.sup]-30[/] J/Hz and a field sensitivity of 
6.6x10[.sup]-13[/] T/Hz[.sup]1/2[/] at the 500 Hz 
frequency. The authors thank S.A. Gudoshnikov and Yu.M. 
Maslennikov for assisting with adjustment of the magnetometer 
electronics, A.R. Kauli and I.E. Graboi for supplying 
high-T[.sub]c[/] superconductor shields, A.V. Kandidov for

concentrators, and E.K. Kovlev, Ye.V. Kolosova, and S.N.

  [Abstract] The most promising avenues for improving 
aircraft nonlinear systems with nonlinear aerodynamics appears 
to be through using on-board digital computers in the control 
loop and thereby creating adaptive digital control systems. For 
this reason, the general stages of methodology for designing 
systems to control highly maneuverable aircraft based on 
step-by-step adaptive control by using the concept of solving 
inverse dynamics problems are considered. The adaptive control 
system considered consists of the following: a nonlinear object 
(i.e., the aircraft), a drive, a booster, a programmer that 
effects the desired change in the state vector of the object 
over time and corresponds to its rudder deviation program, and a 
regulator that uses an algorithm for stabilizing the programmed 
motion and stabilizing the system and ensuring its specified 
dynamic properties in the presence of parametric and external 
disturbances. The system's operation is based on having the 
programmer and stabilization algorithm use information about the 
vector _P_ of the unknown parameters of the object that is 
issued by an identifier during the system's normal operation and 
about the vector _ch_ of the altitude and velocity parameters 
of 
the flight. A logic unit coordinates the adaptive digital 
control system's overall operation, and the programmer 
formulates the desired motion along controlled coordinates given 
random initial conditions of the object as read from transducers 
at specified time intervals. Within the framework of the 
proposed approach, the main stages in developing the required 
control algorithms are as follows: formulating the programmer's 
structure, developing algorithms to identify a model of the 
object, and developing the logic of the system's operation. The 
first stage is considered in detail, and the remaining two 
stages are left for a separate communication. The problem of 
formulating the required programmer entails formulating that 
program control u[.sup]*[/](t) that will, in the 
absence of disturbances, change the object's state vector in 
accordance with a prespecified law x[.sup]*[/](t). 
This is done by using the result of inverse dynamics problems 
and constructing an analytical model of the object used in the 
programmer to calculate u[.sup]*[/](t). A 
simplified nonlinear model of the object is generally used. The 
problem of developing a stabilization algorithm is approached by 
formulating a model of the object's motion that is linearized in 
relation to the control program. The linearized system is 
nonstationary and is formulated with consideration to the 
presence of uncontrollable parametric disturbances arising as a 
result of the inconsistency between the equations of the 
object's motion and the simplified model thereof that is used in 
the programmer. The general adaptive control system design 
principles proposed are illustrated by way of the example of 
formulating algorithms to control the longitudinal motion of an 
aircraft of the Kh-29 type in terms of nonlinear differential 
equations. The example illustrates that formulation of the 
required program control necessitates information about the 
following: the object's initial state (obtained from 
transducers), the required end value of the attack angle 
(specified by the pilot), and estimates of six parameters of the 
object (calculated in the identifier). The function 
u[.sup]*[/](t) is a continuous function of time. 
The importance of delineating acceptable controls is emphasized. 
The proposed stabilization algorithm results in stability of 
maneuvering processes over a broad range of attack angles.

  [Abstract] Algorithms for determining (recognizing) types 
of service objects have been shown to contain three levels. At 
the first level of recognition (i.e., selecting or sorting 
images), a set of lines of sight corresponding to one service 
object is isolated at each moment of observation. In view of the 
inexactness of information about the positions of the 
information spacecrafts' own positions, the presence of random 
errors in on-board measurements, and the density of service 
objects in space, the problem of isolating this set of lines of 
sight is not trivial. At the second level of recognition, a 
correspondence must be established between the spatial positions 
of the service objects determined in the first stage of 
observation at each moment in the observation process and the 
trajectories of the service objects plotted on the basis of 
results of previous observations and representing a set of 
spatial positions of the service object in the previous moments 
of the observation process. Thus, at the second level of 
recognition, a spatiotemporal picture of the motion of a set of 
service objects is formed that encompasses a time interval 
culminating at the moment of the last observation. The third 
level of recognition entails determining the type of service 
object represented by a set of observed points along its 
trajectory in accordance with the respective probability 
criteria. In other words, the third level of recognition 
requires determining whether an object (trajectory) belongs to a 
given class. The characteristic features of the algorithms 
required for performing each of these three levels of the object 
recognition process are discussed. The next stages in the 
process of predicting the motion of service objects involves 
estimating the vector of the initial conditions of their motion 
and then predicting their future position under conditions of 
random disturbances based on angular optical stereo 
observations. The algorithms required for making such 
predictions are based on the use of proximity functions and the 
least squares method and are constructed in accordance with 
mathematical models and singular criteria. The problem of 
determining the error in predicting a service object's movement 
is solved by using information about typical profiles of service 
objects' trajectories and by hypothesizing that a service 
object's movement after the last observation made proceeds along 
that typical trajectory that best conforms to all existing 
observations of the given service object's movement. The problem 
of predicting the service object's future movement is thus 
reduced to modeling its reference motion by using input data to 
solve the least squares problem presented. The operability of 
the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through statistical 
modeling of the process of the information interaction of groups 
of service objects and information spacecraft. After analyzing 
the example presented, the authors concluded that by decomposing 
the problem under consideration and using very simple geometric 
relationships and determinate threshold algorithms, it is indeed 
possible to recognize types of service objects with a frequency 
of at least 0.7 based on data from angular optical measurements 
or 0.99 when integral radiation density is used. Furthermore, 
the proposed algorithms permit recognition of service objects 
with acceptable reliability and speed by using general-purpose 
computers. The algorithms presented are recommended as a 
methodological foundation for creating an information service 
subsystem for use in detection systems and in the event of 
accidental, unauthorized, provocative, and terrorist launches of 
objects with space-based components. Figures 8, table 1;

  [Abstract] An analysis was conducted of the problem of 
synthesis of a terminal control algorithm for multi-dimensional 
nonlinear systems in the presence of state and control 
constraints. The algorithm proposed to solve the problem is 
based on a differential geometry approach to nonlinear systems 
and the concept of inverse problems of dynamics. The algorithm 
includes elements of several heuristic techniques as key 
components, and the proposed solution method entails the use of 
mathematical modeling in the control algorithm development 
stage. The workings of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by 
way of the example of solution of the problem of trajectory 
control of the three-dimensional motion of an aerospace vehicle 
in the three-dimensional prelanding maneuver leg of its flight. 
The underlying idea of the method is as follows: New (auxiliary) 
equations are introduced to transform the equations describing 
the control object's motion to affine form, i.e., to make them 
linear relative to the new equations. The new equations are 
designed to make it possible to transform the resultant 
equations to regular canonic form. After the equations are 
transformed into canonic form based on the concept of inverse 
dynamics equations, a program solution to a terminal problem is 
constructed and then stabilized by using a method proposed and 
published by the author in 1985. The values obtained for the 
auxiliary equations are then recalculated into the values of the 
starting equations. The aforementioned steps constitute the 
basic algorithm. If it does not yield a solution to the 
formulated problem with consideration for all of its constraints 
and for the entire set of initial states, the algorithm is used 
in conjunction with mathematical modeling to select the required 
number of intermediate states, and the sequence of their 
implementation to achieve more complex trajectories is 
established. The end result is an algorithm that establishes, on 
the basis of the initial state, the respective intermediate (or 
assigned terminal) state into which the control object has been 
brought. If the state is an intermediate state, the subsequent 
state into which the object must be brought so as to ultimately 
reach the terminal state is already known. For the example 
presented, it is sufficient to find about 10 intermediate 
states. The new algorithm is said to be suitable for a broad 
class of objects. Although mathematical modeling must be 
resorted to when the algorithm is developed, it may eventually 
be written in ``analytical form,'' i.e., calculated on the basis 
of the formulas derived, and thus does not require computers 
with speeds or amounts of memory greater than those currently 
available. References 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.

  [Abstract] A suboptimal procedure for detecting moving 
images against a conditionally stationary background in the form 
of a sequence of time-separated fragments of images of a 
slightly changing scene was considered. The proposed procedure, 
which is suboptimal from the standpoint of the criterion of the 
maximum a posteriori probability, was synthesized under the 
assumption of the presence in the image being analyzed of random 
geometric distortions caused by a change in the observation 
point and additive gaussian noise. The procedure is based on 
optimal linear filtration of the difference between uniform 
fragments of adjacent frames that were previously combined by a 
correlation technique and on an operation separating statistical 
hypotheses applied to the filter output. The generally accepted 
model of an image was used along with a newly developed method 
of determining the new procedure's main statistical 
characteristics in the case of simple detection. A number of 
particular cases typical for aircraft location information 
systems were considered, and the range of the parameters of the 
backgrounds, moving images, and noise was calculated. 
Mathematical expectation and mean square deviation were 
specified relative to the maximum value of image brightness, and 
a correlation constant was specified in relation to the 
characteristic size of the moving image. The following ranges of 
parameters were calculated for the background: mathematical 
expectation, 0.240-0.400; mean square error, 0.036-0.265; and 
correlation constant, 0.523-2.013. The following ranges of 
parameters were calculated for the image: mathematical 
expectation, 0.320-0.550; mean square error, 0.042-0.200; and 
correlation constant, 1.043-5.996. The following ranges of 
parameters were calculated for the noise: mathematical 
expectation, 0.000; mean square error, 0.014-0.044; and 
correlation constant, 25.56-31.12. The following values were 
calculated for the total error of a one-frame detector in the 
various seasons: winter, 0.932 x 10[.sup]-4[/]; autumn, 0.747 
x 10[.sup]-3[/]; and summer, 0.961 x 10[.sup]-3[/]. It was 
concluded that interframe processing is justified if the errors 
of a suboptimal detector are less than those of a single-frame 
detector. Specifically, it was determined that the use of 
interframe processing is justified if the background's movement 
is limited to 20-40 percent of the characteristic size of the 
moving image. Changing the value of the interframe movement from 
zero to the limiting value was found to result in an increase in 
total error by a factor of 7 to 20. A test of the new 
procedure's validity conducted by way of the example of digital 
processing of a pair of images of a typical scene confirmed that 
the proposed procedure yields an absolutely correct result.

Head, the University, a Network'' rubric: ``Higher Educational 
Institutions Wasting Away From Information Hunger? How Will It 
Be Satisfied?''] 
  [Text] Today the only way higher educational institutions 
[VUZs] cannot train personnel for industry and science at the 
level of world requirements is by using the information 
resources that are accessible to higher education in developed 
countries, which is to say by working in a computer network 
system whose service is maximally adapted to meet scientists' 
and teachers' needs. 
  In Russia, computer networks have also been actively 
developed in the past few years. Unfortunately, most of these 
networks are commercial networks (for example, Relcom, IASNET, 
Sprint) where the price per amount of information sent (i.e., 
the price for traffic) is rather high and the amount of 
information sent by science and higher education is 
traditionally large. 
  The use of noncommercial networks, where traffic is free of 
charge, would therefore be far more valuable for the development 
of higher education. The inter-higher educational institution 
[intervuz] information infrastructure of the Russian Federation 
State Committee on Higher Education, which could be closely tied 
to already existing international scientific research and 
educational noncommercial networks, could become such a network. 
  In view of the formation of the United National Center for 
Coordination (NIIC SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA) of the 
respective programs of development of telecommunications of the 
Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Federation State 
Committee on Higher Education, the creation in Russia of a 
research and education network with its own higher education 
information resources (a project to develop higher educational 
institution data bases, knowledge networks, library 
telecommunication networks, and other resources along the line 
of UNICOM-RUSSIA) and virtually unlimited access to all 
resources of international academic and scientific networks (the 
Academy of Sciences project SUEARN/FREEnet) has become a real 
possibility. 
  There are a number of prerequisites permitting rather rapid 
creation of a well-developed electronic infrastructure for 
intervuz information exchange in Yaroslavl and the northwestern 
region based on the computer system of Yaroslavl State 
University. 
  The university has a data processing center with affiliates 
in the following: the biology, mathematics, and economics 
departments; the information science laboratory of the 
information science and computer engineering department of the 
new information technologies center; computer support group of 
and the political research center of the social sciences 
department. The existing segment of the heterogeneous education 
and research network was created on the basis of the Yaroslavl 
State University Data Processing Center, which includes computer 
systems of different levels ranging from personal computers of 
the IBM PC/386 and 486 (OS UNIX, MS DOS, Windows) class and 
computers of the YeS 1061 (OS VM/SP RSCS) mainframe type to 
modern network servers of the SPARC Classic (OS Solaris) type. 
  Systems have been developed for interaction of a segment of 
a 
network with a central computer cluster in the NICC 
SUEARN/FREEnet/UNICOM-RUSSIA at the Organic Chemistry Institute 
imeni N.D. Zelinski of the Russian Academy of Sciences by using 
a multiprotocol technology that makes it possible to implement 
up to four logical channels based on one physical channel (in 
our case, the protocols NYE, TCP/IO, and X.25 are implemented 
simultaneously). This process was used in a system of 
noncommercial open networks for the first time in the Russian 
Federation. Operation along switched telephone lines for users 
at other higher educational institutions in accordance with the 
UUCP protocol is supported. 
  Operation of a bridge-radio channel connecting the data 
processing center's central local area network with its segment 
in the mathematics department (a distance of up to 6 km) has 
been started up and is being supported. 
  Network software that is part of the standard for 
mathematics 
software of the international nodes of university computer 
centers, i.e., NETSERV, LISTSERV, NETNEWS, Internet Gopher (in 
server and client versions), and ASTRA, has been installed at 
the research and education network's hosts, (at)SUYARS.BITNET, 
(at)UNIV.YARS.free.net, (at)ICN.YARS.free.net, and 
(at)CLASSIC.YARS.free.net. A whole series of programs are in the 
development stage: formation of departmental local area networks 
with plans to combine them into a single university local area 
network and to then integrate them into the EARN/BITNET/Internet 
global international networks; a university data processing 
center; and organizatio of a full-scale regional center of the 
research and education network. 
  Training of scientific and teaching personnel and students 
at 
higher educational institutions in the principles of working in 
open-type global international networks has begun. New software 
supporting the teaching process based on the use of 
international teleconference materials and remote information 
resources (including the conduct of teleconferences on 
LISTSERV(at)SUYARS.BITNET) are being assimilated. The computer 
center at Yaroslavl State University is conducting enterprising 
research in the development of an optimal scheme for using 
computer resources at the oblast's scientific research 
institutes and higher educational institution for scientific 
research and educational purposes. This scheme is based on 
Internet-type technologies and makes it possible to integrate 
mainframe-type high-efficiency computers at multiple-access 
computer centers and local area networks of personal computers. 
  The first phase of experimental computer data bases on 
instructional process quality control systems (specialization: 
chemistry, biology, ecology) with interactive and E-mail 
teleaccess is being prepared and installed. 
  A systems analysis of teleconference information flows on 
international list servers and different file servers is being 
conducted, and systematic information service of a number of 
scientific directions at the departments of Yaroslavl State 
University has begun. 
  Satisfactory results have been obtained in working in a 
remote terminal mode with a catalogue of electronic libraries of 
very large universities in the United States and Europe, 
including the U.S. Library of Congress. 
  Overall coordination of the development of the network's 
materials and equipment and software base was conducted at 
Yaroslavl State University's Data Processing Center within the 
framework of cooperation with the National United Center of 
International Projects RAN/SUEARN/FREEnet and the Russian 
Federation State Committee on Higher Education (University 
Communications UNICOM-RUSSIA). Work related to using the 
information resources of international computer networks in the 
instructional process (the data processing center's affiliate at 
Yaroslavl State University's biology department) was conducted 
during the course of the implementation of a number of 
directions of the Universities of Russia program. 
  To date, nodes of EARN/BITNET and FREEnet/Yaroslavl State 
University have been registered in international routing tables, 
including in the largest U.S. networks. 
  Plans for the future include work in four directions 
involving implementation of ideas developed in the past 15 
months, provided that sufficient financing is available. In 
essence, this is that fragment of the federal plan that was 
developed at the national coordination center 
FREEnet/SUERN/UNICOM (Organic Chemistry Institute imeni N.D. 
Zelinskiy, Russian Academy of Sciences). 
  Our experience in developing computer networks indicates 
that 
it is, for all practical purposes, possible to develop segments 
of a unified research and educational network in the Russian 
Federation based on data processing centers at the universities 
and institutes of the Russian Federation State Committee on 
Higher Education with implementation of a program of 
reoutfitting already operating computer centers and equipping 
them with both personal computers and workstations and 
multiple-access computers.

  [Abstract] An important task of a system for establishing 
communications (SEC) in navigation and command systems and 
communication radio systems is to measure signal carrier 
frequency and provide target indication to the frequency 
tracking system. The objective of the work was to study 
algorithms for measuring the carrier frequency of a continuous 
phase manipulated signal that use two fast Fourier transform 
(FFT) readings of a discrete complex spectrum and comparing them 
to known algorithms using one FFT reading. The article analyzes 
the case when symbols boundaries are unknown. Analysis methods 
are described. Synchronous and asynchronous SEC operating modes 
are examined. The synchronous mode yields a lower average 
carrier frequency measurement error than an asynchronous mode. 
The asynchronous mode makes it possible to reduce frequency 
estimate shift and in certain cases yields a lower maximum error 
than the synchronous mode. Figures 3, references 4.

  [Abstract] The objective of the work was to analyze the 
effect of time scale transformation (TST) of envelopes of 
signals reflected off moving targets on detection 
characteristics when target velocities and bases of sounding 
signals increase. An expression for determining losses of the 
probability of correct detection due to not taking into account 
the TST coefficient of envelopes of detected signals relative to 
the probability of correct detection in the case of optimum 
processing is derived. As expected, when TSTs of detected 
signals are not taken into account detection characteristics 
deteriorate. The derived results make it possible to determine 
the relationship between deterioration of moving target 
detection characteristics when of detected signals of envelopes 
of detected signals are not taken into account during processing 
on signal compression factors and target velocities. Tables 1,

to derive design formulas for detection characteristics for a

the derived formulas are presented. The detection algorithm is 
extremely sensitive to the accuracy of estimates of spectral 
parameters of the noise. The derived results make it possible to

order to ensure the required efficiency of detection. Figures 1,

  [Abstract] Discrete control of phased antenna arrays (PAAs) 
causes additional errors in setting the angular position of a 
beam. In some cases discreteness errors considerably limit the 
accuracy of angular measurements. The objective of the work was 
to synthesize an aperture algorithm for calculating phase 
distributions (FDs) of PAAs with discrete phasing that do not 
have the drawbacks of other known methods for reducing the total 
error. The proposed algorithm for calculating phase distribution 
of a two-dimensional PAA of N x N elements with discrete phasing 
makes it possible to compensate for errors of discrete direction 
of a PAA. In terms of the accuracy beam guidance the algorithm 
is equivalent to averaging the directivity diagram by isophase 
supports. It makes it possible to reduce the angular error of 
beam setting with low aperture expenditures and high speed of 
the FD computer. Figures 2, tables 2, references 2.

  [Abstract] After the 1986 Chernobyl accident, a large-scale 
program to improve the safety and reliability of all plant units 
with type RMBK reactors by improving the reactors' physical 
characteristics was implemented. Specifically, the void 
reactivity coefficient (_a_[.sub]_P_[/]) was reduced by 
placing additional absorbers into the reactor core's fuel 
channels and switching the reactor over to fuel that was 2.4 
percent enriched in uranium 235 (instead of 2.0 percent). 
Between 1986 and the present, the number of additional absorbers 
in the reactor cores of the first, second, and third units at 
the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant was increased to 80, 85, and 
93 units, respectively, and between 51 and 63 percent of the 
fuel assemblies contained fuel that was 2.4 percent enriched in 
uranium 235. The safety of these measures was regularly checked 
by measuring the reactors' key physical parameters. The void 
reactivity coefficient and fast power reactivity coefficient of 
the reactors were checked at least every 200 effective operating 
days, and each time a unit was shut down for repairs, the 
reactors' subcriticality was estimated experimentally. The 
essence of the method used to measure the void reactivity 
coefficient lay in determining the weighted response of the 
reactor control system's automatic regulator when the feedwater 
flow rate was varied and the content of steam in in the core was 
altered. Preliminary analysis of the results indicated that the 
main factors affecting _a_[.sub]_P_[/] are the number of 
additional absorbers in the reactor and the number of fuel 
assemblies that are 2.4 percent enriched with uranium 235. A 
simplified model was then developed for use in estimating the 
effectiveness of safety measures taken on reactors. The analysis 
performed on the basis of the model indicated that installing 10 
additional absorbers in a reactor reduces the void reactivity 
coefficient by 0.25_b_[.sub]ef[/] and switching the reactor 
to fuel that is 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 reduces 
_a_[.sub]_P_[/] with an effectiveness of 
0.35_b_[.sub]ef[/] per 1,000 fuel assemblies that are 2.4 
percent enriched in uranium 235. These results are consistent 
with published data from experiments performed at all nuclear 
power plants with RBMK reactors. Next, the effect of dewatering 
the coolant loop of the reactor protection system was estimated. 
No significant dependence of the magnitude of the effect on the 
number of additional absorbers or the number of fuel assemblies 
that are 2.4 percent enriched in uranium 235 was discovered.

  [Abstract] The operating reliability of the high-pressure 
heaters of K-1000-60/1500 turbine systems has been demonstrated 
to be inadequate inasmuch as the said heaters fail about every 
3-4 years. The internal erosion of the heaters' spiral tube 
coils, which are made of carbon steel, and the resultant 
increased feedwater flow rates are among the main reasons for 
the heaters' high failure rates. In view of these facts, the 
following ways of improving the high-pressure heaters' operating 
reliability were compared in a technical and economic analysis: 
bypass part of the feedwater past the high-pressure heaters; 
replace the entire heat exchange surface of all high-pressure 
heaters every 3-4 years; replace the heat exchange surface of 
all high-pressure heaters with one made of stainless steel after 
the first four years of the heaters' operation; and install 
three parallel groups of three high-pressure heaters in all 
newly constructed units. According to the calculations 
performed, using a bypass for part of the feedwater past the 
high-pressure heaters to reduce the feedwater's flow rate is 
nearly 1.36-1.6 times less expensive than replacing the entire 
carbon steel heat exchange surface every 4 years. Switching to a 
stainless steel heat exchange surface is nearly twice as 
expensive as complete replacement of a carbon steel tube surface 
after every 4 years of a unit's operation. In the case of units 
that are in the process of being constructed, it is economically 
feasible to replace six high-pressure heaters with nine 
high-pressure heaters with a carbon steel heat exchange surface.

  [Abstract] The limited program of development of nuclear 
power in Ukraine has exacerbated the ever-increasing shortage of 
fossil fuel, especially the high-quality gas-mazut that is used 
primarily to heat homes. The experience that Ukraine has accrued 
in relation to small nuclear power plant-based district 
home-heating systems in such areas as Zaporozhye and the 
Yuzhno-Ukrainsk area has conformed that such systems are 
reliable and safe and that it is technically feasible to create 
high-performance nuclear power plant-based centralized heat 
supply systems. The institute Ukraine Power Industry 
[Ukrenergoprom] has conducted technical and economic, planning 
and design, and exploratory studies regarding the use of 
existing, as-yet incomplete, and planned nuclear power plants in 
all regions of the former USSR and member countries of the 
former CEMA for purposes of district heating of cities and 
population centers within a 150-km radius around the said 
nuclear power plants. The studies confirmed the economic and 
technical feasibility of such a plan over a wide range of 
thermal loads. Studies have also indicated that the 
series-produced and modified condensation turbines that have 
been developed for nuclear power plants at the Turboatom 
Scientific Production Association in Kharkov make it possible to 
provide the thermal loads required in all nuclear power 
plant-based central heating systems. In Ukraine, the most 
realistic scenario for heating the cities of Nikopol, Marganets, 
and Zaporozhye is that of creating central heating systems based 
on the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. Toward that end, the 
Ukrenergoprom is collaborating with the institute 
Atomenergoproyekt in Kharkov and the Turboatom Scientific 
Production Association to conduct detailed technical and 
economic studies this year. The said studies will be followed by 
design and exploratory studies to substantiate the economic and 
ecological feasibility and technical possibility of creating 
Ukraine's first large-scale nuclear power plant-based district 
home-heating system. According to calculations already 
performed, by 2000-2005, the six units of the Zaporozhye Nuclear 
Power Plant can, even if only bled of 230 MW (200 Gcal/h) heat, 
cover the thermal load calculated for a central heating system 
to meet the home-heating needs of Nikopol, Marganets, and 
Zaporozhye. The projected central heating system will replace 
more than 2.2 million metric tons of fossil fuel per year and 
reduce toxic stack gas emissions in the three cities by 60-70 
percent. References 4 (Russian).

<F P=106> [Article by M.P. Umanets, chairman, Ukraine State Committee </F>
for the Study of the Nuclear Power Industry] 
  [Abstract] In 1992, Ukraine had 14 operating nuclear power 
plant units with a total installed capacity of 12,818 kW. During 
1992, Ukraine's nuclear power plants produced 73,750.6 million 
kW of electricity, which constituted 29.4 percent of all 
electric power produced in Ukraine. Because Ukraine's atomic 
scientists have been able to maintain the necessary ties with 
Russia since the collapse of the USSR, it is certain that 
Ukraine's nuclear power industry will be able to develop and 
become a serious structural component of the country's power 
grid. It has become entirely clear that the apparent rejection 
of nuclear power in the West after the Chernobyl accident was 
either a myth or else the invention of technical and economic 
policy. It has become quite evident that even those countries 
possessing the overwhelming majority of natural fossil fuel 
reserves will not be able to survive without a closed nuclear 
fuel cycle, and construction of new nuclear power plants has 
continued throughout the world. Today, the absolute majority of 
specialists believe that the only way for Ukraine to create an 
independent nuclear power industry is on the basis of its two 
domestic energy carriers, i.e., coal and uranium. The following 
are among the results of policies instituted after the Chernobyl 
accident: Ukraine is now short a minimum of 12 nuclear power 
plant units with a capacity of 1 million kW each; attempts to 
maintain an acceptable level of operation of the country's 
existing power plant units are being foiled by one obstacle 
after another, including an inability to pay suppliers and flow 
of highly trained personnel to Russia because their wages in 
Ukraine are 3 to 5 times less than those offered in Russia; 
construction of six VVER-1000 units with a safety level higher 
than the existing 10 units of the same type remains unfinished; 
and opportunities to export electricity are being lost along 
with future markets and dollars that could be used to buy 
imported equipment or advance scientific-technical progress. The 
time has come to develop a new nuclear power policy that will 
guarantee safety. Its main components should be as follows: 
develop the nuclear power industry based on modern nuclear power 
plant units meeting modern safety requirements; create a 
domestic nuclear fuel cycle based on the use of existing uranium 
deposits; create a national system of scientific-technical 
maintenance of work in all points of the nuclear fuel cycle from 
uranium recovery to radwaste burial; increase and strengthen the 
prestige of workers in the nuclear power industry on both morale 
and monetary planes; and create a legislative base as quickly as 
possible. The moratorium on construction of new nuclear power 
plants on Ukraine territory that was approved on 2 August 1990 
has been particularly damaging to Ukraine's nuclear power 
industry. Of the six nuclear power plant units left unfinished 
as a result of the moratorium, three can be put on line in 1-1.5 
years and three in 5-6 years. These units already meet 
International Atomic Energy Agency safety standards for existing 
nuclear power plants and are on a par with the best nuclear 
power plants now operating abroad. Furthermore, before the six 
plants are actually put into operation, measures will be take to 
further improve their operating safety and reliability.

  [Abstract] An experimental study of heat transfer along 
vertical bundles of heat releasing rods in nuclear power plants 
(AES) was made, of specific concern being the transition from 
radiative-conductive to natural convective heat transfer and 
dependence of the corresponding critical Reynolds number on the 
bundle height. The dependence of the heat transfer pattern on 
the bundle height was evaluated by testing three bundles of 37 
tubular rods, all rods having a 10 mm diameter and a 1 mm wall 
thickness. The three bundles were formed by identical regular 
hexagonal (4-5-6-7-6-5-4) arrays of tubes with a 14 mm center-to 
center distance between neighboring ones, but their heights 
differed: 700 mm, 1270 mm, 2500 mm. Each bundle was wrapped in a 
3 mm thick jacket of a matching hexagonal shape with an 89 mm 
inside width between parallel sides of the hexagonal 
cross-section. The bundles were assembled by spacing the tubes 
by means of a template at each end and, if necessary, one in the 
middle. Each bundle was heated by passage of electric current 
through the tubes and were cooled with water flowing through a 
large circular channel surrounding the jacket. The temperature 
was measured with thermocouples in capillary steel sheaths, at 
equidistant locations along the height: six locations along each 
of the two shorter bundles and ten locations along the third 
one. The tubes around each bundle to which nine or ten 
thermocouples were to be attached had been selected so as to 
ensure symmetry and reproducibility of readings. Tests were 
performed under conditions of mild vacuum: 0.1 MPa and 0.2 MPa. 
For calculating the maximum temperature in a bundle, the data 
have been processed in terms of both Nusselt and Rayleigh-2 
numbers. The results, combined with available data on fuel rods 
in a 1000 MW high-power graphite-moderated channel reactor 
(RBMK-1000) with boiling-water coolant and an identical but 2845 
mm high bundle of fuel rods, provide an adequate basis for 
design optimization aimed to ensure cooling of such bundles by 
natural convection. Figures 9; references 4.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Andreyevich Vasilenko, director </F>
of the Scientific Research Institute (NITI) of the RF Ministry 
of Atomic Energy (Minatom Rossii), under the rubric 
``Science--The Hour of Decision''; conducted by POISK 
correspondent A. Kuznyetsov; date and place not given. 
  [Text] The Chernobyl disaster has doomed Russian 
atomic energy to the role of unwanted stepdaughter--favored 
neither by the people, nor by the powers that be--just a source 
of constant headaches. But, atomic energy currently provides 25 
percent of the electrical energy used by the European part of 
Russia, and it would be impossible to simply dispense with it. 
At the same time, the useful lifetime of the present generation 
of nuclear reactors is now drawing to a close, and we must think 
about the construction of replacement facilities. Given 
existing conditions, this undoubtedly will only be possible if 
the population in locales of proposed AES (atomic energy 
station) construction--in addition to being provided with 
economic incentives--are convinced of their safety. The concept 
of atomic energy development which has taken form in Minatom 
Rossii calls for installation of a new generation of safer 
reactors, which achieve reliability through inherent design 
characteristics, rather than by the thickness of the reactor 
walls. The record of past mistakes points out the need for 
creation of scientific-industrial centers for atomic energy, 
which will document reactors in order to conduct in-depth 
verification of their safety. One such center is currently being 
created in the city of Sosnoviy Bor in Leningrad Oblast, on the 
grounds of the formerly hush-hush Minatom Rossii research 
center. Our correspondent met with its director, V. Vasilenko, 
and asked about the project to develop a Northwestern 
Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy, as well as the 
work the institute itself. 
[Kuznyetsov]Vyacheslav Andreyevich: Until recently, 
your institute was well known only to a narrow circle of 
specialists. What have you been doing there? 
[Vasilenko]The institute (NITI) was formed in 1962 by 
a decree of the government of the USSR. Its creator, Academician 
A. Aleksandrov, personally selected the site for the institute, 
and, in subsequent years, the institute gave life to the city of 
Sosnoviy Bor. In 1964, the first offices were laid out in the 
structural framework, and, in 1968, work was begun on 
development of testing facilities designed by NIKIET [expansion 
not provided], ``Gidropress,'' and OKBM [expansion not 
provided]. The institute was established as a test base for 
experimental naval nuclear power facilities (YaEU), and, in the 
course of its own development, progressed from conducting 
complex experimental work to wide-ranging scientific 
investigations of all aspects of the facilities. This resulted 
in the development and introduction of new technological 
processes which increased the tactical and technical data bases 
of these facilities. 
[Kuznyetsov]Which is to say, your institute actually 
brought these facilities into existence? 
[Vasilenko]Yes, that is an accurate assessment. The 
institute worked with the chief designers, assuming the very 
difficult and, frankly, thankless role of critic, inasmuch as we 
were called upon to uncover inadequacies in these facilities, 
the correction of which required design and technology changes. 
The institute thus gave birth to the basic, fundamental, 
sea-going power facilities. 
[Kuznyetsov]How many researchers are there at the 
institute now? 
[Vasilenko]More than 2000 people, of whom about a 
fourth are scientific and technical personnel carrying out 
broad-based research. More than 500 nuclear industry service 
workers provide maintenance services, as well as preparations 
for experiments and modernization operations. A powerful 
infrastructure also exists which permits the institute to thrive 
and grow. 
[Kuznyetsov]In our difficult times right now, what is 
it that the institute is concerned with? 
[Vasilenko]We are actively working with the Navy, and 
the total volume of its orders amounts to about half of our 
financing. There are government orders from a number of 
enterprises within the atomic energy complex--this allows us a 
respectable subsistence. In the process of building naval 
nuclear reactors, we have developed several operational 
directions, one of which is the design of training systems. 
Operational personnel receive their training in our systems, and 
the trainers are aggressively employed as preparation for 
operations under non-standardized conditions, as well as for 
handling other situations. And, it is only after nuclear power 
plant processes have been extensively modeled in trainers that 
we proceed with the power plant testing program, which improves 
substantially the safety of these potentially dangerous 
facilities. In addition, we have worked on the neutron physics 
properties of the RBMK reactors [large-capacity, pressure-tube 
reactors], and, in the process of this work, an enormous 
potential has been put in place. In particular, the ``Sapfir'' 
program developed by our enterprise: It can be used to compute 
the reactor core design for any reactor of this type. We are 
aggressively offering our programs to consumers in the nuclear 
power station sector. 
[Kuznyetsov]This kind of research and development 
requires a potent scientific base. 
[Vasilenko]As far as that is concerned, we pride 
ourselves on it. Since 1972, each one of the institute's 
installations has developed computerized test-measurement 
systems which have scale capabilities five to ten times superior 
to the standard measurement devices used in atomic energy 
installations. We are required to demonstrate and document that 
our measurements are precisely and metrologically aligned. We 
have accumulated archives of experimental data, which--I 
believe--belongs to the nation. We are intensively utilizing 
this, not only to obtain the most precise characteristics of 
systems now being used, but also to plan the parameters of 
future reactors. The capabilities of our computerized data 
collection and processing system, ``ANIS,'' have, to this time, 
not been surpassed within the field. This instrument allows 
observations of the condition of reactors, as well as standard 
control and testing systems, which, in combination with 
extremely accurate experimental data, provides a new level of 
quality in research. 
[Kuznyetsov]What products and services are you 
offering to the international market? 
[Vasilenko]We have a number of highly competitive 
products, especially, an innovative, fail-safe operational 
system which functions in real time. This system is unique in 
its ability to counter any type of malfunction in the 
computerized test equipment and assure operations even during 
degradation of a test-measurement or control system. The 
principles underlying its operation are still state-of-the-art. 
We also possess technology for equipping trainers of any size 
and class, including conceptual, functional, local and 
half-scale types. We are in a position to put together, without 
outside help, a real-time simulator system for training 
operational personnel, and for analyzing crisis situations. The 
technological characteristics and economic indicators of these 
systems are better than for similar systems being supplied by 
joint ventures and Western firms. 
[Kuznyetsov]If your trainers are of such high 
quality, what do you say to the question of why you are not 
producing them for our stations? As far as I know, French and 
American trainers are being installed these days in preference 
to yours... 
[Vasilenko]It is, unfortunately, for us as well, a 
somewhat puzzling situation. One of the reasons I can see in the 
fact that, previously, the West was closed to people in our 
ministry, but now, one may quietly travel abroad and purchase 
whatever is needed. Another factor is that defense industries 
began to offer formerly secret products of a higher quality, 
which had not been available to the civilian atomic energy 
sector. Project designers and equipment operators seemed to be 
confused, since they were not familiar with these technologies, 
but their use substantially restructured the very technological 
solutions which they traditionally employ. And, there, the West 
offers familiar solutions--almost, in fact, a gift... Help for 
us from abroad! They help, but not to the benefit of our atomic 
energy industry. Nearly all joint projects--they are Trojan 
Horses, in which Western firms calculate how to move into our 
atomic market. This process, whether willingly, or unwillingly, 
is continually accelerating, which will produce a serious effect 
in the future. Our own high-level native technologies are 
becoming irrelevant, In the final analysis, this will lead to 
our atomic energy industry being pushed into the background, 
where it will not develop to any significant degree. France, for 
example, jealously defends its market, and protectionism is 
growing there. With us, everything is exactly the reverse. In 
fact, a number of things, particularly associated with safety, 
are being artificially exaggerated and depreciated. Conditions 
are driven by the formation of public opinion, which does not 
provide for the required level of safety in our atomic power 
stations. I think that, at first, it is necessary to equalize 
the forces needed for elevating domestic testing and control 
systems to a higher level, and to examine the possibility of 
using our own technology, and then adopt solutions. Right now, 
there is still time to develop domestic atomic power station 
control systems, based on new principles and technologies. 
Otherwise, tomorrow, we shall find ourselves bound to the West. 
[Kuznyetsov]What are the institute's plans for the 
future? 
[Vasilenko]For the past three years, we have been 
intensively applying our wealth of experience to the civilian 
atomic energy sector, and we are now working on the creation of 
the Northwestern Scientific-Industrial Center for Atomic Energy 
(NPTsAE). This work is part of the Russian effort to develop a 
new generation of medium-capacity, safer nuclear plants, which 
are being brought on line in accordance with the government 
program, ``Environmentally Clean Energy.'' Since 1991, we have 
been working with the Leningrad institute, 
``Atomenergoproyekt,'' to develop the new-generation VVER-640 
(V-470) water-moderated, water-cooled power reactor designed by 
the experimental design bureau, ``Gidropress.'' Together with 
the reactor facility design team and the scientific 
leadership--the Kurchatovskiy Institute--we shall be conducting 
research on the dynamics of reactor behavior, as well as 
processes within the reactor and containment vessel. 
[Kuznyetsov]Why have you experienced delays on this 
same project? 
[Vasilenko]This reactor incorporates substantively 
innovative approaches, such as passive heat venting, a high 
degree of automation, and a dual containment feature based on a 
design developed for the descent of high-altitude military 
aircraft. The use of reactor cores employing reduced unit loads 
allows for better fuel utilization and improves nuclear station 
safety. The passive systems provide an outlet for residual heat 
release from the reactor core during an emergency situation. 
Nuclear plant safety is assured, under normal operation, over 
the course of the entire projected service period, which amounts 
to 50-60 years. An example of the use in this project of new, 
high-level technologies previously not seen in civilian reactor 
design is the base slab of the reactor vessel, which is capable 
of withstanding earthquakes of up to 8 points on the MSK-64 
[expansion not given] scale. The levels of radiation exposure 
for nuclear plant workers do not exceed 0.1 percent above 
background values common in Russia--that is to say, the 
radiation exposure for the population and the environment is 
measured at minimal. Its inherent characteristics enable the 
VVER-640 to be sited at any location on earth. It does not 
require water resources, as it can make use of dry cooling 
towers. When the reactor is outfitted for water cooling, it can 
exhaust as much as 60,000 cubic meters of feedwater per day. At 
640 MW, the electrical power capacity of the reactor also is 
optimal for the majority of regions, not all of which require 
million watters. After thoroughly analyzing the new projects 
developed by our reactor designers, we came to the conclusion 
that the VVER-640 project is the most promising, not only from 
the perspective of the internal needs of Russia, but also for 
penetration of foreign markets. This conclusion has been 
confirmed by our subsequent research and by the results of an 
international competition in St. Petersburg, where a panel of 
judges marked this particular project, ``recommended,'' and 
``advanced.'' Yet, the special nature of this project lies in 
the fact that enterprises in Leningrad Oblast and St. 
Petersburg, such as the production associations, ``LMZ,'' 
[Leningrad Metals Plant] ``Izhorskiy Zavod,'''' [Izhorskiy Heavy 
Equipment Plant] and ``Kirovskiy Zavod,'' and others, are in a 
position to fully assume the entire range of operations involved 
in the engineering, manufacture and supply of nuclear plant 
power blocks using the VVER-640 reactor to regions within 
Russia, as well as abroad. We suggested to local authorities at 
all levels that the scientific-industrial center for 
new-generation reactor development be organized around our 
facilities, explaining its prospective benefits for us and the 
region. Both the Ministry and the government have supported the 
project. The future promise of this project is already being 
confirmed by the generation of orders in Russia; a decision is 
in place concerning construction of the triple-exchange 
[triple-loop, heat exchange] blocks on the Kola Peninsula, and 
talks are underway on construction of the triple-blocks in 
Primorye, as well as preliminary negotiations on their 
construction abroad, and one of the indispensable conditions for 
closing the export contracts is construction and testing of the 
main block. The electric power being produced in our main block 
will travel to such potential consumers as future Russian ports 
on the Baltic Sea, and the high-speed, St. Petersburg-to-Moscow 
rail line. 
[Kuznyetsov]Why did this specific NITI become the 
base for the center? 
[Vasilenko]Our advantage lay in the fact that the 
institute had at its disposal the necessary potential in terms 
of technology, experience and knowledge to complete the work in 
the shortest time-frame, and to develop a new-generation main 
block for use as a potent argument in the atomic sector of the 
Russian energy program. We also have no need to create storage 
facilities or district heating networks, and we have control 
over the construction, having built the four blocks at the 
Leningrad nuclear station, in addition to holding a license for 
construction of atomic power stations. We have dozens of atomic 
sector enterprises nearby, with great project-management 
capabilities. Which is to say that the center combines the 
construction, as well as technical and technological, experience 
of the entire atomic energy industry, the coordination of which 
will allow us to obtain a new result, a new level of 
quality--and a safe new-generation power station. 
[Kuznyetsov]According to statistics, about 50 percent 
of the incidents at atomic energy stations are the fault of 
personnel. What are you doing to forestall such extraordinary 
occurrences? 
[Vasilenko]We will not simply build a main block, but 
create a scientific-industrial center, where, along with the 
reactor facility, we shall establish a teaching-training complex 
with a center for analysis of crisis situations. There is a 
proposal for a fully staffed trainer at the complex, not only to 
deal with issues of training and retraining of personnel, but 
also to simulate emergency situations, and provide follow-up 
analysis of them. The center for analysis of crisis situations 
will receive information from all operational power blocks, and 
we will be capable of disseminating safety recommendations to 
cover any situations. The complex will house a technical school 
for training mid-level technicians from atomic power stations 
under construction. In addition, the center will contain test 
facilities for modeling emergency processes, and for 
experimental research on serious emergencies, as well. 
[Kuznyetsov]What do you think will happen if this 
project is delayed? 
[Vasilenko]A study of the prospective projects of 
Western firms indicates that the ``Westinghouse'' firm is 
planning to obtain a license to construct a similar block in 
1995. If we delay our construction, they will be the first to 
enter the world market. Right now, we have a real chance to get 
there ahead of them. We just have to persevere, and we will make 
a breakthrough onto the world nuclear market.

  [Abstract] The U.S.-developed RETACT (Real-time Advanced 
Core and Thermohydraulic) program was used to study processes of 
interphase interaction of gas-liquid flow in the circulation 
loop and the core of an installation with a water-modulated 
VVER-1000 reactor in accidents involving coolant loss. The 
researchers examined accidents with uncompensated flows and 
partial malfunction of the emergency core-cooling system. The 
calculation assumed the failure of one of three emergency 
low-pressure feed pump, as well as the failure of the passive 
sector of the emergency core-cooling system. The researchers 
concluded that, with uncompensated flows of loop one and the 
operation of the emergency core-cooling system, water seals form 
in the ``cold'' lines of the circulation loop. The behavior of 
individual loops is unsymmetrical from the standpoint of the 
formation of water seals. The magnitude of flow determines the 
formation of the water seals and the variation in the 
hydrostatic head of the coolant in them. The formation of the 
water seals leads to a worsening of the thermohydraulic state of 
the core and, consequently, to it overheating (and triggering of 
the emergency core-cooling system). A pipe of at least 50 mm in 
diameter must be used to drain the water seals. Figures 11,

  [Abstract] A radiation safety plan must include 
computerized monitoring of all phases of atomic energy plant 
use, including foreseen and unforseen situations. Emergency 
measures must be developed to protect personnel and the 
population and coordinate the efforts of organizations at 
various levels. A radiation safety system has been proposed 
which includes an automated system to process information on the 
environment and predict environmental changes in a timely 
manner. The system consists of: ecological monitoring of Ukraine 
as a whole; atomic energy plant monitoring and monitoring of the 
plant region; a control center to counter the effect of 
accidents and to develop recommendations; a crisis center to 
organize special help in the event of an accident; and an 
automated system to monitor the radiation situation. A schematic 
shows the hierarchy of organizations involved in the proposed 
radiation safety system. Figure 1.

  [Abstract] Before combustion, natural gas is subjected to 
thermochemical reprocessing to increase efficiency and reduce 
harmful emissions. This thermochemical reprocessing, or 
conversion, may improve the use of fuel energy in thermal 
electric power plants. It may also substantially reduce the 
amount of fuel used to produce electricity. Consequently, 
thermal electric power plants may be modernized virtually 
without reconstruction of existing equipment. Endothermic 
conversion is found to be more efficient than exothermic, but 
requires radical retooling. The problem is being examined in 
conjunction with the US Institute of Gas Technology. Exothermic 
conversion may be used without retooling. The conversion process 
is described. Exothermic conversion involves the combustion of 
natural gas with an insufficient amount of oxygen to convert 
CH[.sub]4[/] into CO+2H[.sub]2[/]. Endothermic conversion 
involves conversion of CH[.sub]4[/] into CO and 
H[.sub]2[/]. The reactions which occur in fuel conversion and 
changes to existing equipment, which are minimal, are described. 
In addition, some of the heat of stack gases is used to heat 
water. Figures 3; table 1; references 3 (Russian).

  [Abstract] Currently, Ukraine is meeting only 30% of 
its 
energy needs with its own resources. New coal deposits have been 
found in the Kharkov and Lugan regions (the Barvenkov and 
Bogdanov deposits, respectively). A single complex has been 
created for the extraction and processing of coal and production 
of electric energy all at one site. Preliminary research has 
shown that a 1600-1800 MW state regional electric power plant 
can be constructed at the Barvenkov deposit, and a 2700 MW plant 
can be built at the Bogdanov deposit. Technical documentation 
will be developed for these projects in 1993-1994. The 
configurations of the deposits are described. The industrial 
coal resource of the Barvenkov deposit is 403.8 milion tons. The 
Bogdanov deposit has balanced resources of 1068 million tons, 
with industrial resources of 860 million tons. Properties of the 
coal at each deposit are listed in a table. Table 1.

  [Abstract] When compared with thermal and nuclear power 
plants, solar power plants are inferior in that they do not 
possess demand adaptability and are incapable of providing 
protracted continuous power generation on account of their high 
sensitivity to daily, seasonal, and yearly changes in solar 
radiation. These shortcomings of solar power plants may be 
eliminated by creating combined solar-powered and fuel-fired 
plants such as those that have been operating since 1985 in the 
United States. The possibility and feasibility of siting a 
megawatt-class combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant in 
Ukraine for the purpose of stable commercial production of 
electric power was analyzed. The following seven strategic 
aspects of siting such a plant in Ukraine were considered: 
finding a priority technological combination of one 
thermodynamic cycle (conversion of heat into electricity) with 
an existing power system (conversion of solar radiation into 
heat); determining the ``niche'' of use of the electric power 
produced at a combined solar-powered and fuel-fired plant; 
determining the ecological impact of such a plant; using the 
earth's surface; identifying tap and fresh water sources to be 
used for cooling; identifying a source of fuel (i.e., natural 
gas); and giving consideration to the implications of the 
shortage of electric power in the southern part of Ukraine. The 
analysis indicated that a megawatt-class combined solar-powered 
and fuel-fired plant in Ukraine could reduce the amount of 
fossil fuel required to produce electric power in Ukraine if it 
were sited so as to make use of the actinometric characteristics 
(``solar potential'') of the semiarid southern rayons of the 
Odessa, Nikolayev, and Kherson oblasts and western and eastern 
regions of the Crimea and if the plant were designed to include 
parabolic concentrators with hollow heat receivers in its 
``solar'' part and gas-steam turbine units with steam injection 
into the combustion chambers in its ``thermal'' part. Figures 4, 
tables 4; references 12: 6 Russian, 6 Western.

  [Abstract] In the past 5-10 years, Ukraine has studied, 
estimated, and mapped its overall geothermal resources and the 
geothermal resources of individual regions, sites, and deposits. 
The Transcarpathian, Crimean, Ciscarpathian, Poltava, Lugansk, 
Kherson, and Zaporozhye oblasts have been deemed possible sites 
for the use of geothermal energy. According to scientists' 
estimates, the potential geothermal energy resources of these 
areas can support the operation of (1) geothermal power plants 
with a total capacity of as much as 230 million kW assuming well 
depths up to 7 km and (2) a geothermal heating system with a 
total capacity of as much as 1,370 million kW assuming wells up 
to 4 km deep. It should be noted that these are cautious 
estimates that have been made after studying about 15 percent of 
all potential sites. The Transcarpathian Oblast has been 
determined to be especially promising for the development of 
geothermal power generation. In the said oblast, rock at depths 
up to 6 km has7 temperatures ranging from 230 to 275C. Four 
extensive territories (total area, 330-380 km[.sup]2[/]) with 
an elevated geothermal gradient have been identified in the 
Transcarpathian Oblast. Ukraine still lags behind foreign 
countries from the standpoint of developments related to 
intensive extraction of the heat of heated rocks located deep 
below the earth's surface. Several underground circulation 
systems have been considered along with possible designs for a 
geothermal power plant that includes a geothermal circulation 
system. Special attention is being paid to the combined use of 
low-potential heat and heat obtained by burning fuel, which is 
estimated to result in an efficiency of 40-70 percent depending 
on the end temperature of the coolant discharged from the system 
and the initial temperature of the thermal water. The best 
systems currently achieve temperatures of 35-45C. The use 
of heat pumps in geothermal heating systems will make it 
possible to reduce this temperature to 5-10C, and an 
initial coolant temperature of 70-80C will make it possible 
to double the intensity of the heat extraction process. A 
computer program has been developed to perform 10 sequential 
calculations to determine the technical and economic feasibility 
of proposed geothermal power plants. According to the program, 
given the elevated geothermal gradient encountered in Ukraine 
(i.e., 22-25 m/), the optimum coolant temperature would be 
190-220C, which translates into a circulation zone depth of 
5.0-5.5 km. Given current prices for electricity produced at 
nuclear power plants and state regional electric power plants, a 
geothermal power plant constructed in regions with an elevated 
geothermal gradient (i.e., &lt;20 m/) would be competitive 
in 
today's market. After the year 2000, even geothermal power 
plants constructed in regions with average geothermal gradients 
(i.e., &gt; 25 m/) would be competitive with nuclear and 
state 
regional electric power plants. The operating modes and process 
equipment of experimental geothermal power plants in Ukraine 
remain to be worked out. Construction of commercial geothermal 
power plants may begin thereafter (beginning in 1993-1994) in 
areas with high geothermal gradients. Figures 5; references 6

  [Abstract] In view of the shortage of conventional energy 
sources and constant increase in power generation facilities, 
researchers are devoting a great deal of their attention to wind 
power systems. The main advantages of such systems are that 
their production is economically pure and, unlike conventional 
and nuclear power plants, they do not require the use of 
expensive and scarce fuels. At present, the main directions in 
the use of wind are the production of mechanical and thermal 
energy to meet the electricity needs of small enterprises and 
institutions and the construction of wind power plants (both 
self-contained plants and plants that are components of power 
systems). In many countries throughout the world, significant 
funds are being allocated to R&amp;D directed toward creating 
wind 
power plants. Low- and medium-capacity wind power plants have 
gained the greatest popularity to date. Megawatt-class units are 
less prevalent; however, a great deal of R&amp;D is being 
focused on 
their development. Plant designs with horizontal windmill blade 
rotation axes are favored over designs with vertical axes 
because of the complex theoretical and practical problems 
entailed in using vertical axes. Virtually all wind power plants 
designed with a horizontal blade rotation axis have the windmill 
located in front of the tower. Most towers are made of metal 
(some are made of plastic), and windmills may be made of wood, 
steel, aluminum, or plastic. Windmills used to be built without 
any basic research. As wind energy continues to gain popularity, 
however, increasing progress is being made in the areas of 
researching their mechanics, the strength and stability of their 
design, and their aerodynamics. Increasing attention is being 
paid to their effect on the environment. According to various 
data sources, at the beginning of the 21st century, wind power 
plants will produce from 1-2 to 15-20 percent of all energy 
produced. The following are among recent directions/results of 
research in the area of designing and using wind power plants: 
use of an Intel 8036 16-bit microprocessor in the system to 
control the power output of the induction generator included in 
wind power plants, development of a nomogram for graphic 
determination of a wind power plant's design power factor (the 
ratio of the average power developed by the wind power plant in 
a selected time period to its rated capacity), studies of the 
characteristics of the turbulence at the site of the WTS-4 
megawatt-class wind power plant along the height of the windmill 
to determine the fatigue strength of wind power plant elements 
and related studies of the stresses in the root sections of 
windmill blades, use of a laser anemometer to optimize the loads 
of wind power plants' generators as a function of wind velocity, 
development of a simple method of calculating the 
characteristics of a windmill with a horizontal rotation axis, 
and use of specially developed equipment to study the 
aerodynamics of wind power plants. The problem of calculating 
the energy characteristics of a wind power plant is extremely 
complicated and continues to command a great deal of 
researchers' attention. The use of nonmetallic materials in wind 
power plants is also receiving a great deal of attention. A 
10.7-m-long wooden ship was equipped with a wind power plant 
with a three-blade windmill measuring 3.96 m in diameter 
installed at a height of 5.49 m on the ship's mast. A running 
motor operating on the energy supplied by a wind power plant has 
produced ship speeds of 7.3 km/h, and with a head wind, speeds 
of 56.6 km/h have been reached.
