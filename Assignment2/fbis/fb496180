  [Text] Bujumbura, 29 Apr (PANA) -- Burundi Prime Minister 
Anatole Kanyenkiko set a new 48-hour deadline Thursday [28 
April] for civilians to surrender illegally kept weapons to the 
appropriate authorities. 
  The deadline was given at the end of a two-day meeting in 
Bujumbura with the governors of 15 provinces to review the 
security situation in the interior of the country. But, he 
warned, those asking for an extension of the deadline should 
know that the disarmament plan is now in its implementing stage. 
He said that the Army would maintain the necessary pressure on 
rebelling districts and arrange safe passages to evacuate people 
who wish to leave insecure areas. 
  Another meeting was held in the capital between 
representatives of rebels and some high-ranking officers of the 
Army operating in the troubled sector of Kamenge, in the north 
of the capital. 
  The minister of defense, Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, said that 
this was an attempt to appease the public. But eyewitnesses 
reported Bujumbura to be extremely tense. There has been heavy 
gunfire in the southern and northern parts of the capital.

  [Text] The disarmament of the civilian population in 
Burundi is creating some tension. Disarmament was agreed on 22 
April by the political and military authorities. Its 
enforcement was supposed to start on 24 April at 1800. Because 
of some objections, however, the disarmament operation had to be 
postponed, especially in the area of Kamenge, north of 
Bujumbura, where there are apparently some problems. However, 
yesterday the security forces were given an order to carry out 
the disarmament operation. Here is Burundi Foreign Minister 
Jean-Marie Ngendahayo: 
  [Begin Ngendahayo recording] Last night the army and the 
people of Kamenge exchanged fire. Only this morning the people 
living in Kamenge started to be evacuated. Thousands of people 
are today leaving Kamenge. As you know they are being gathered 
at a stadium in Bujumbura. We are trying -- with the help of 
ministers, of the army's high-ranking officials, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR, and other 
partners of Burundi -- to place them under the responsibility of 
well-known leaders so that once the search in Kamenge is over 
these people, these very same people, can immediately return to 
Kamenge. There will be people responsible for each and every 
street so that order will be kept by the very people living 
there. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Security Minister Leonard Nyangoma by Rupert </F>
Neudeck in Germany; date not given -- recorded, in French with 
superimposed German translation] 
  [Text] [Announcer Wolfgang Labuhn] After the complete 
collapse of the state order in Rwanda in eastern Africa, fear of 
similar developments is also growing in neighboring Burundi, 
because in Burundi, too, there is a century-old conflict between 
the tribes of the Hutu and the Tutsi. In contrast to Rwanda, in 
Burundi it is still the Tutsi minority that rules the Hutu 
majority and relies on the army, which is exclusively composed 
of Tutsis. On the weekend, the Tutsi Army began to search 
Hutus, who had been crammed into a stadium, for weapons, after 
the armed forces had attacked the district of Kamenge, which is 
inhabited by Hutus, in the capital city of Bujumbura. 
  This was a reason for my colleague Rupert Neudeck asking 
Leonard Nyangoma, security minister of Burundi, about the 
situation in Kamenge during his visit to Germany. 
  [Nyangoma] Since late afternoon of 28 April the Burundi 
Army, 
which consists exclusively of Tutsis, has started to bomb the 
district of Kamenge in Bujumbura. This attack was carried out 
with the heaviest weapons, that is, with artillery and grenades; 
it is even said that Stalin organs were used. However, no 
matter how this attack was carried out, it is quite clear that 
the Hutu inhabitants of Kamenge are now victims of these attacks. 
  [Neudeck] Are there already figures about the victims, the 
dead, and the destruction in Kamenge? 
  [Nyangoma] We do not yet have any exact figures, but I have 
already been told that the number of dead is reportedly very 
high. However, we have received reports that the Burundi Army 
allegedly massacred about 2,000 people in the hills around the 
capital city. Casualties in Kamenge must be very high, because 
the Hutu people there are surrounded by the army, they cannot 
flee anywhere, they have no protection at all. 
  [Neudeck] How can you explain this complicated situation to 
the German public? 
  [Nyangoma] On 21 October 1993 there was the attempt to carry 
out a coup d'etat, when the then president and his associates 
were killed. The consequences are known. Internal ethnic 
fighting flared again in Burundi. There also was heavy material 
damage. Currently, we are again facing an imminent coup d'etat. 
Nowadays the excuse used by the Burundi Army for torturing and 
attacking the population is that the population must be disarmed. 
  We, the Government, basically agree with disarming the 
population. However, there remains the question of who is 
disarming whom. To the extent to which the Tutsi army has again 
and again issued arms to its Tutsi compatriots since 1972, it 
has completely given away the legitimation for disarming the 
population, particularly, now, exclusively the Hutu population. 
  Therefore, the disarming, which is carried out now under 
these conditions, is rejected by the people. It should be 
carried out only by the international community. 
  There is a group of extremist Tutsis among the people that 
does not want to accept the process of democratization in 
Burundi. This group wants to guarantee the status quo. This 
group enjoys so many privileges that it does not want to agree 
to this process. They think that the process of transparent 
democratization in Burundi will not leave them with their 
privileges. This, however, is wrong, because since 
democratization began in June 1993, no property rights -- 
neither of Hutus nor of Tutsis -- have been touched upon. This 
group of extremist Tutsis wants to stop democratization, because 
it is worried about its privileges. 
  [Neudeck] Mr. Minister, what do you ask of the German 
Government and of the German people in this serious situation? 
  [Nyangoma] The people of our country are in a difficult 
situation. Even the new institutions of democracy have been 
taken hostage by the army. Since 21 October 1993, we have lived 
like hostages. Unfortunately, our crisis in Burundi is not 
really known abroad. The international community does not even 
really see it. Germany, in particular, however, should know 
about our crisis. I think that particularly Germany, as a 
democratic country, should now react to our crisis. Germany 
should alert the international community so that the people in 
Burundi are helped in this extremely tense situation so as to, 
in particular, solve the problem of this terrible coexistence of 
an army in Burundi that is not neutral and the threatened 
population. We are appealing to the international community to 
help us organize a round table or a conference that might help 
with reestablishing peace and security in this region. 
  [Neudeck] In what framework do you envisage a solution for 
your country? 
  [Nyangoma] I believe that the solution should be tackled 
bilaterally as well as multilaterally. An international 
conference should be convened, with the particular participation 
of our neighboring states, that is, Tanzania, Zambia, and Kenya, 
but also with the help of those countries, which have long been 
friends with Burundi. I am particularly thinking of Belgium, 
France, and the United States. Of course, we also need the 
support of the United Nations very much, just as of the 
Organization of African Unity.

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, April 29 (AFP) -- Hundreds of thousands 
of Rwandans poured into neighbouring Tanzania Friday [29 April] 
fleeing ethnic bloodletting, UN officials said, describing it as 
the biggest refugee exodus they had ever experienced. The mass 
flight came amid continued fighting between government and 
rebels forces, particularly in southern Rwanda, including a 
reported massacre when police opened fire with machine guns on 
refugees trying to flee a stadium. 
  A UN High Commissioner for Refugees statement said that 
250,000 people had sought refuge in Tanzania in a 24-hour 
period, many of them speaking of a worsening military situation 
in southern Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile a UNHCR statement said Rwandan police and 
militiamen had opened fire Friday with machine guns and grenades 
on 5,000 refugees trying to flee from a stadium where they were 
being held, killing an unknown number. It said the attack 
happened at a stadium in Cyangugu, southwestern Rwandan, where 
the refugees initially sought shelter in the wake of widespread 
ethnic unrest which erupted at the start of April. The 
statement said an unknown number of people were killed and 
injured in Friday's attack, adding that local authorities had 
prevented aid agencies from visiting the area, and the refugees 
from leaving the stadium. 
  World Food Programme spokesman Francis Mwanza meanwhile said 
that about 320,000 Rwandans had reached Ngara, in north-western 
Tanzania, in the past few days, amid the general exodus. 
  An official of the UN humanitarian department, Lance Clarke, 
meanwhile said fighting had prevented aid experts from reaching 
southern Rwanda, controlled by government forces. Clarke told a 
news conference here that Rwanda faced a "humanitarian 
disaster." A UNHCR spokesman attributed the mass exodus to a 
"worsening of the situation" in southern Rwanda. 
  The rebels seemed to be tightening their grip on Kigali 
while 
the government forces lacked direction from their leaders, an 
international official in the capital said. The capital could 
fall to the rebels "very shortly," said the official, who 
requested anonymity. 
  Meanwhile in neighbouring Burundi, which has largely avoided 
the carnage sparked by the deaths of both countries' presidents 
on April 6, at least three people were killed as security forces 
tried to disarm militiamen. A soldier and two civilians were 
killed overnight, a military spokesman said in the capital 
Bujumbura. 
  In Brussels, the European Commission said it was sending a 
total of 1.13 million ECU's (1.3 million dollars) worth of 
humanitarian aid to help some 100,000 Rwandan refugees who have 
poured into Tanzania in recent days. 
  In a related development Belgium said it was barring members 
of Rwanda's interim government until it received a retraction of 
allegations that Belgian troops were involved the April 6 
downing of the president's plane.

  [Excerpts] As the fighting continues in various parts of 
the country, many more massacres are committed by the remnants 
of the Presidential Guards, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic] and MRND [Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development] youthwingers [words indistinct] and 
some elements in the Rwanda Army. The latest and horrifying 
incident took place yesterday [29 April] in Cyangugu, where 
about 300 people were killed. These were among the 5,000 people 
who had taken refuge in the stadium. The murderers threw 
several hand grenades at the refugees and used machine guns in 
heavy fire to kill the innocent people. The ICRC is making 
arrangements to help the rest of the people escape to Bukavu, in 
Zaire. 
  Meanwhile, a ceremony to hand over Burundi refugees took 
place at Mulindi yesterday. The Burundi refugees, who numbered 
about 20, had been rescued by RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
troops from Kigali passing through Byumba to Mulindi. They were 
handed over to the Burundi ambassador in Uganda and were taken 
to Kampala [passage omitted] 
  In a [word indistinct] incident, thousands of refugees and 
displaced people flocked to Byumba town, controlled by the RPF. 
All these people had come from Commune Rutongo near Kigali. 
The worst thing to note about these people was that they had 
all lost their families. [passage omitted] To the relief of the 
refugees in Byumba, the Red Cross brought in several tons of 
food and cooking oil and the RPF medical personnel were doing 
their best to treat the wounded. Meanwhile, foreign journalists 
continue to visit areas under RPF control. Today, they visited 
(Kami) Barracks near Kigali, which is completely under the 
control of the RPF.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 2 (AFP) -- Twelve people have been 
killed and 113 wounded in a Kigali church by mortar fire, 
according to a statement issued by the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda and made available here Monday [2 May]. 
  Two shells hit the Sainte-Famille Church in downtown Kigali 
Sunday where more than 2,000 people fleeing the fighting between 
government forces and Rwanda Patriotic Front rebels had found 
shelter. The UN mission said it could not determine the origin 
of the fire. 
  UN special envoy Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said the latest 
attack again targeted civilians who were "innocent victims of a 
war they do not want." He urged the warring parties not to 
attack civilians. 
  Within the last two weeks shells have also hit the Roi 
Faycal 
hospital and the Amahoro de Kigali stadium, killing more than 60 
people. 
  More than 12,000 people mostly Tutsis, fleeing massacres 
perpetrated by the armed forces and Hutu militias, have found 
shelter in these two facilities under UN protection.

  [Excerpts] After the death of President Habyarimana in a 
plane accident on 6 April, the clique in power in Kigali 
implemented a plan to systematically exterminate all Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development members and 
sympathizers, the sole party in power in our country for the 
last 20 years. The carnage was intended to result in the deaths 
of all those who do not hold the same views as the dictatorial 
clique. The death of President Habyarimana served as a pretext 
to launch organized massacres. Today, three weeks after the 
incident, more than 200,000 have fallen victim to these 
unprecedented barbaric acts, which still continue. To kill so 
many people in such a short time is a record in the history of 
organized massacres. 
  Following the tragedy that our country has and is still 
experiencing, our foreign media colleagues came to cover the sad 
events. But they often come with their pre-conceived ideas, one 
such being that the Rwandan problem is an ethnic one. The 
dictatorial power has always orchestrated a disinformation 
campaign, intended to make people believe that the Rwandan 
problem is an ethnic one between the Hutu and Tutsi. 
Fortunately, Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials have 
consistently taken every opportunity to explain the reality of 
the situation to the international community. That is why, on 
22 April, RPF President Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, during a 
visit to Kibungo Prefecture in eastern Rwanda -- a prefecture 
totally under the control of the RPF, just like Byumba -- met 
with and was interviewed by foreign journalists who were 
visiting the disaster-hit region. I invite you to listen to 
this interview, however, first I would like to inform you that 
the questions were put forward through an interpreter. Colonel 
Kanyarengwe began by recalling and confirming that the Rwandan 
problem is a political one, which requires a political solution. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
President, 
in case the peace negotiations fail, will the RPF be able to 
capture Kigali? If that happens, what are your plans? 
  [Kanyarengwe] Concerning the negotiations, we think that the 
Arusha negotiations are sufficient, since they constitute a 
document which was the outcome of a long period of discussions 
and compromise between the RPF and the government. We may have 
to adjust the terms of the Arusha Accord. Otherwise, that 
agreement is enough for us. In view of the pace of events, for 
the time being we are taking precautions before entering Kigali. 
But we think that, taking into account the pressure which is 
being placed on the capital, things will be sorted out over the 
next few days. I cannot tell you the hour or day, but we are 
sure that over the next few days the fate of Kigali will be 
settled. As to the arrangement of an administration after 
Kigali falls, that is a question that we will discuss with 
survivors of those other opposition parties which were in 
existence before this episode began. [end recording]

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] asks Rwandan 
refugees currently fleeing to Tanzania to return voluntarily to 
their country. At a time when there is little security, mainly 
due to the massacres being carried out by certain government 
forces, with the assistance of the Interahamwe, [Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development militia] able 
survivors are fleeing. There are also around 6,000 others who 
are threatened by the Interahamwe and government forces in [word 
indistinct] and churches in Kigali. 
  It is the same in foreign countries. A large number of 
Rwandan refugees are fleeing. Among them are those attempting 
to flee to Tanzania. Since 27 April, around 500,000 refugees 
have arrived in Tanzania's Ngara region. Reports say that some 
of the refugees are faced with disease, while others have wounds 
caused by the Interahamwe and government forces. The refugees 
arriving in Tanzania are made up of various groups. The first 
group is made up of Rwandans who fled their homes because of the 
killings and insecurity caused by the Interahamwe in Kibungo. 
Another group is made up of the Interahamwe, including the 
Murambi burgomaster, [words indistinct] who carried out the plan 
for the massacres which failed later on. When the RPF troops 
arrived in the area, the Interahamwe and other killers, 
including government forces, due to the wicked things they had 
done to the innocent, decided to flee. They realized they could 
not fight RPF troops who were prepared to rescue innocent people 
in the area. The third group of refugees in Tanzania is made up 
of those who fled the fighting between the RPF troops and the 
government forces elsewhere in the country, before fleeing the 
area around Kibungo. The fourth category is that of Rwandans 
who were staying in Kibungo, who felt insecure following the 
deterioration of security caused by the divisionistic propaganda 
of RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille Collines] and Radio 
Kigali [words indistinct]. 
  The RPF, once again, informs the international community and 
Rwandans that it is the fundamental right of those refugees 
currently in Tanzania to return to their country. There is no 
problem at all between the RPF and the refugees. The best 
indication of this is that there are people who are still in 
their homes and who are living in harmony with the RPF troops in 
Kibungo. Those who are sick following injuries caused by the 
Interahamwe are being treated and are improving. Foreign 
journalists are in the area to witness it. The RPF denies 
unfounded reports to the effect that it might be stopping people 
from fleeing and has closed the border with Tanzania. The UNHCR 
[UN High Commissioner for Refugees] itself earlier announced 
that about 500,000 refugees from Rwanda had fled to Tanzania 
since 27 April. Then, how can those who claim the RPF is closing 
borders justify that? As you heard, people are still crossing 
the border to Tanzania. Currently, instead of being a real 
facilitator, Tanzania has started to (?assist) the enemy of 
Rwanda. After Habyarimana's death, Tanzania closed its border 
to stop people from fleeing from the Interahamwe. Among the 
people that country allowed in are many of the killers who fled. 
When they fled, Tanzania opened the border. 
  The other sad thing for Rwandans and the international 
community who were involved in the Arusha talks is that Tanzania 
[words indistinct] Mwanza, Tanzania, seriously mistreated 
Rwandan refugees in the area, claiming that they had celebrated 
Habyarimana's death. Every person has the right to show 
happiness or sorrow. There is always a reason for that. 
Tanzania, which acted against the Rwandan refugees in Mwanza, 
did not say anything when, in October 1990, the late 
Habyarimana's government declared a 30-day celebration over the 
death of the late RPF leader Rwigyema. One should ask the 
Tanzanian officials whether those who celebrated in Mwanza acted 
against any of the country's laws. This is yet another 
injustice against Rwandans. 
  Tanzania should be a truly neutral facilitator and should 
openly declare that it supports Rwandans and the international 
community to [word indistinct] the killers, instead of 
protecting them and turning a blind eye to the wrongdoings of 
the clique. The RPF committed itself to joining hands with 
Rwandans [words indistinct] those outside Rwanda, such as those 
in Tanzania and other countries, to return home soon so as to 
act together for the liberation of Rwanda.

  [Excerpts] The report by the UN High Commission for 
Refugees [UNHCR] that the Rwandan Patriotic Army has blocked the 
Rwanda border with Tanzania is baseless and absurd. The UNHCR 
has reported that thousands of people trying to escape to 
Tanzania are stranded on the Rwandan side of the border with 
Tanzania because the Rwandan Patriotic Army has closed the 
Rwanda-Tanzanian border at Rusomo. The Rwandan Patriotic Army 
has not closed the border and contrary to these reports, more 
than 500,000 people have crossed into Tanzania through the 
border point at Rusomo within the last three days. [passage 
omitted] 
  As for now, there are no people whatsoever at the Rwandan 
side of the border trying to cross into Tanzania. On the 
contrary, a number of people who had crossed into Tanzania are 
now trying to return home, for the massacres have been stopped 
since the arrival of the Rwandan Patriotic Army forces in this 
area. [passage omitted] The UNHCR could have been fed with 
fabricated and false information by people with ulterior 
motives. These could be the same people who had earlier blocked 
the entry points into Tanzania, blocking the refugees who were 
running away from the massacres committed by the Rwandan 
Government forces and this made the refugees easy prey for the 
Army and the armed government-controlled militia. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpts] There is no question of talks between the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front and the putschist government, as some 
media -- such as Radio Kigali and RTLM [Radio-Television Libre 
des Mille Collines]-- have reported. In fact, Radio Kigali and 
Radio RTLM [words indistinct] the clique of extremists have 
spoken of negotiations this Tuesday in Arusha between the RPF 
and a government delegation. Meanwhile, BBC radio, in its 
Swahili-language evening news bulletin, also mentioned talks 
between the two sides -- the RPF and the Rwandan Government. 
(?You should remember) that the information was announced by 
the Tanzanian Foreign Ministry spokesman. All this information 
is [words indistinct]. The RPF has always been [word 
indistinct] -- there is no question of negotiations with a 
clique of extremist (?murderers) who (?are responsible for the 
blood) of innocent people. [passage omitted] The RPF therefore 
prefers not to hold negotiations between the RPF and a putschist 
government delegation. 
  [(Clandestine) Radio Muhabura in English to Rwanda at 1815 
GMT on 1 May broadcasts the following: 
  ["In response to reports by Radio Rwanda, Radio-Television 
Libre des Mille Collines--and even BBC--that there will be a 
ceasefire negotiation between RPF and the Government of Rwanda 
on Tuesday [3 May] in Tanzania, RPF wishes to make it clear that 
there has been no such arrangements on the part of RPF. The RPF 
has no intentions to and will never negotiate any ceasefire with 
the illegitimate and self-imposed government in Rwanda. The RPF 
maintains its earlier position that it can only negotiate a 
ceasefire with the Rwanda Government forces if they so wish. 
Thank you."]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe in </F>
Mulindi on 30 April] 
  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] informs national 
and international public opinion about the following points: 
  First, a human tragedy of unprecedented scale is currently 
taking place in Rwanda, openly and publicly witnessed by the 
entire international community. This tragedy has now truly 
become an act of genocide and a crime against humanity, 
perpetrated by a clique of extremist individuals and a faction 
of the government army. In less than three weeks -- since 6 
April -- the clique has decimated the democratic opposition and 
orchestrated the massacre of more than 200,000 people of all 
ethnic groups. 
  Second, these massacres are part of an extermination plan 
prepared long ago by high-ranking officials from the dictatorial 
regime of the late President Habyarimana. To this end, arms, 
ammunition, military training, and all sorts of preparations 
were given to Habyarimana's party, the Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense 
of the Republic militias backed by the Presidential Guard. The 
fact that a plan for political extermination was being prepared 
was exposed long before the signing of the Arusha agreement, by 
various sources inside and outside the country. 
  Third, negotiations for a peace agreement are used by this 
clique of extremists as diversionary movements, the aim of which 
are to gain enough time to finalize this extermination plan 
which includes, for example, organizing militias, setting up a 
propaganda radio station, and deploying agents of violence 
throughout the entire country. 
  At the same time, the clique has done everything possible to 
prevent the implementation of these very peace agreements. All 
these diversionary moves were monitored closely by the 
international community. 
  Fourth, given the shock expressed by this same international 
community towards the horrors committed since the beginning of 
the Rwandan conflict and during the entire Arusha peace talks. 
The RPF was somehow expecting that, in the face of the ongoing 
massacres, the international community assumed all its 
responsibilities to contribute to end them by unreservedly 
condemning all these criminal acts, providing all necessary 
humanitarian aid to those in danger, and by refusing both 
political and diplomatic support to these murderers who are 
attempting to place themselves in power in Kigali. 
  Fifth, these criminals were so far condemned only by a few 
governments and international and humanitarian organizations. 
Many others continue to hide behind diplomatic silence and a 
general lack of concern, while large-scale genocide and crimes 
against humanity take place in front of their very eyes. What 
is even worse, the French Government, received at the highest 
level, a delegation of these criminals, which supports their 
extermination policy and inhumane acts. 
  Sixth, the RPF: 
  a. Reminds the international community of its full 
responsibility in the face of the genocide and crimes against 
humanity being committed in Rwanda in front of its very eyes. 
  b. Condemns all forms of relations that may give this group 
of murderers backing to its extermination policy and an 
opportunity to strengthen its political and diplomatic position. 
  c. Urges the international community to isolate this clique 
of criminals by refusing to hold any form of dialogue with it, 
and not to give any form of political support and advice to this 
clique. 
  d. Refuses to yield to the murderous blackmail of a clique 
of 
criminals that has established as a method of governance the 
massacre of people, the taking of hostages and the assassination 
of the democratic opposition. 
  e. Thanks governments and international organizations, as 
well as all well-wishers who denounce the clique of the 
murderers and help people in danger. 
  Issued, Mulindi, 30 April. 
  Signed, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, RPF chairman.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the RPF in Mulindi on 30 April] </F>
  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, brings to the 
notice of the press and the international community at large the 
following: 
  1. That the massacres currently going on in Rwanda are 
designed to exterminate a certain section of the population of 
this country. The massacres are carried out by a clique of 
murderers constituted of extreme groups like the Presidential 
Guard, the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic], MRND 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development] 
militias and some elements in the government army. In less than 
three weeks, since the accident of the 6th April 1994, the 
murderous clique has killed more than 200,000 people of 
different ethnic groups. 
  2. That the massacres have been long planned by the 
high-ranking government officials of the then Habyarimana 
government, the training and arming of CDR and MRND militias 
were clear signs of the plan. This plan was known by people 
inside and outside the country even before the signing of the 
Arusha peace agreement. 
  3. That during the Arusha peace negotiations the extremist 
clique was busy [words indistinct] confusing innocent citizens 
as the murderous group was busy planning activities, including 
the restoration of radio [word indistinct] for propaganda 
purposes. At the same time, the group was making it impossible 
for the setting up of the broad-based transitional institutions 
(?agreed on under) the Arusha agreement. 
  4. The RPF appeals to all countries that have been following 
and are assisting to carry out the Arusha peace negotiations to 
condemn openly and without reservations the massacres in Rwanda 
and to refrain from giving any attention or assistance to the 
self-imposed [break in transmission] instead, such countries 
should give assistance to the (?threatened) innocent people. 
  5. The RPF has noted that some countries and nongovernmental 
organizations have already given assistance to the victims of 
war. Some others have not. It is sad to note that the French 
Government has (?responded) and given audience to the 
self-imposed government in Rwanda. Does this mean that the 
French Government is supporting the killing done in Rwanda, and 
by the people who make up this government? 
  6. The RPF wishes to remind the international community of 
the following: 
  a. That the international community has obligations and 
responsibilities toward human beings and life should not be 
destroyed to this extent while the international community keeps 
quiet about it; 
  b. the RPF condemns any country or organization that [words 
indistinct] or recognition to the self-imposed government in 
Rwanda and condemns anything done by any country to promote the 
interests of this government as regards international relations; 
  c. The RPF appeals to the international community to 
dissassociate themselves from this government and even to extend 
asylum to those who took part in the killings [as heard]; 
  d. The RPF requests the international community not to lose 
hope because of the open threat that the killers will continue 
to murder and kidnap people; 
  e. the RPF wishes to extend its sincere thanks and 
appreciation to all countries, international organizations and 
individuals who have shown concern for the plight of the 
Rwandese people during these difficult times. 
  Done at Mulindi this 30th day of April 1994. 
  Signed by Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, chairman of the RPF.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] secretary general, Major Theogene Rudasingwa, has appealed 
to the UN to send a replacement for Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, 
the UN representative to Rwanda. Dr. Rudasingwa told the Voice 
of America radio reporter that Dr. Roger Booh-Booh did not have 
the capacity to handle the political crisis in Rwanda. Just 
before the war, Roger Booh-Booh openly advocated the inclusion 
of CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] in the 
broad-based transitional assembly, knowing very well that the 
CDR was aiming and had the intention of exterminating the Tutsi 
people and all those who did not support the then government of 
Habyarimana.

  [Text] Dear Rwandans, lies in our country are too 
widespread. Have you heard the lies spread by the clique of 
killers on their radios, RTLM [Radio-Television Libre des Mille 
Collines] and Radio Rwanda? The clique continues to lie to the 
world about Rwandan issues, saying that the problem in Rwanda is 
ethnic. However, in reality the problem is political. The 
clique continues to mislead Rwandans by using the ethnic issue, 
even though it is irrelevant. 
  They claim their troops are fighting against Belgians and 
Ugandans in addition to the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. 
These are pure lies. In their claim that they are fighting 
Belgians, Ugandans and the RPF, we want to know how their troops 
are fighting? What are their numbers so as to be able to fight 
whites, foreigners and the RPF all at the same time? Rwandans, 
you can understand that these are lies. You should not listen 
to the clique of killers who are following their own interests, 
as has always been the case when they dare to claim that their 
troops are doing well at the front, as if the troops themselves 
are unaware of how they have been defeated by the RPF troops. 
They were defeated, they fled [words indistinct].

  [Text] The clique has once again accused Uganda, with the 
aim of claiming to the world that that country had attacked 
Rwanda, so that the world community would feel pity and 
expresses support for them. They hope for a repetition of the 
situation in 1990, when the same lies were used and gave France 
a pretext to come to their rescue. Sindikubwabo and his friends 
should know that we are no longer in 1990. We are now in 1994, 
when lies and pretexts are no longer reasons, nor are they 
easily accepted, since the Rwandan issue is already known. 
There is no need to try to regionalize the problem -- that is 
not the disease from which our country is suffering.

  [Text] Kinshasa, 29 Apr (AFP) -- Christian Badibangi, 
deputy external relations minister in Tshisekedi's radical 
opposition government, yesterday at a news conference advocated 
"armed struggle against the current government to achieve 
democracy in Zaire." 
  Mr. Badibangi, leader of the Zairian Socialist Union 
affiliated to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition 
hard-line faction [USOR], said he was convinced that the only 
way to find a solution to the current political deadlock is "by 
resorting to arms." The problem will be quickly resolved by 
"engaging the people in an armed struggle, instead of hesitating 
and wasting time with consultations and other meetings by the 
High Council of the Republic-Transitional Parliament." 
  Mr. Badibangi also said his party reserved the right to quit 
the USOR in case the latter "would prefer to continue to toe the 
line of nonviolence, a principle which has still not proven to 
be effective. 
  Another radical opposition political leader, Jacques 
Malanda, 
of the Convention of Nationalist Reformers, also affiliated to 
USOR, had earlier threatened to resort to an "armed resistance" 
at a news conference held on 2 March in the Angolan capital.

  [Text] Members of the broad-based National Union and Public 
Salvation Government met today at the weekly cabinet meeting, 
which was chaired by Prime Minister Faustin Ririndwa. Here is a 
report on the cabinet session, read by government spokesman 
N'gongo Luwowo, minister of communication and press. 
  [Begin Luwowo recording] Under the chairmanship of His 
Excellency Mr. Faustin Birindwa, the prime minister and head of 
government, the members of the transitional executive met today, 
29 April, at the Hotel du Conseil, for their weekly meeting. 
The following items were examined: 
  1. The state of the nation. 
  2. The situation within the High Council of the Republic- 
Transitional Parliament [HCR-PT]. 
  3. The situation in Rwanda. 
  Moving to examine the first item, government members were 
informed about an increasingly greater influx of Rwandan and 
foreign refugees moving towards Zaire, who were searching for a 
haven of peace and tranquility. Goma in North Kivu and all the 
border towns with Rwanda are particularly affected by this 
influx of people -- men, women, and children -- completely in 
disarray and fleeing the atrocities which the various rival 
Rwandan factions are engaged in. 
  Today's cabinet meeting also examined the unfortunate 
incidents which took place on the night of 26 April in 
Mbanza-Ngungu in Bas-Zaire, during which undisciplined men in 
uniform engaged in certain reprehensible acts. The cold storage 
facilities of some shops in Manza-Ngungu were looted of their 
contents. 
  After rapidly bringing these undisciplined soldiers under 
control, the military hierarchy -- immediately after bringing 
the situation under control -- dispatched to Mbanza-Ngungu the 
chief of staff of the Army, the deputy chief of staff of the 
National Gendarmerie, and an intelligence officer from the 
General Chief of Staff Headquarters. All these officers were 
charged with conducting a thorough investigation into the 
authors behind these incidents. 
  The same team is charged with determining the level of 
responsibility of all those involved, before sending them to a 
military tribunal for exemplary and appropriate punishment. In 
this regard, the Government of the Republic wants to strongly 
denounce the misinformation campaign recently launched by some 
politicians who, it says, have intentionally spread lies and 
false rumors, with the aim of inciting our uniformed countrymen 
to engage in actions that run counter to military duty and 
discipline. 
  The minister in charge of relations with the HCR-PT briefed 
the government team on an unfortunate incident which took place 
yesterday at the People's Palace, where a group of parliamentary 
members belonging to the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition 
and allies [USOR], prevented the plenary session of the 
transitional legislative organ from taking place. Shouting, 
whistling, chanting songs, and making a great amount of noise in 
the room, these transitional parliamentarians, some of which 
wore sporting outfits, pushed their irresponsibility to the 
point of tearing the attendance form to pieces on two occasions. 
  There is every indication that the parliamentarians had 
planned this action -- they do not seem to grasp the magnitude 
of the nobility of their mission and the importance of the great 
task they shoulder. At a time when a serious economic and 
political crisis is hitting the country, the Zairian people have 
a right to expect different behavior from the assemblymen, and a 
different attitude within this transitional institution. 
  In every respectable parliament other methods and language 
exist that are better fitted to situations which may crop up. 
Also, there are other means of expressing one's opinions within 
a parliamentary house. Until the contrary is proven, whistling, 
chants, and the attitudes demonstrated yesterday at the People's 
Palace, are not what the sovereign people of our country expect 
of their representatives. 
  The search for solutions to the ills plaguing Zaire calls 
for 
a display of a minimum amount of tolerance, civility, and 
courtesy to those who do not share the same ideas. 
  In conclusion, the executive members of the Transition 
Executive deliberated on the prevailing situation in neighboring 
Rwanda -- a brotherly, friendly country. The Government of the 
Republic is keenly following developments in Kigali, as well as 
in other towns and communities in Rwanda, and bitterly deplores 
the undescribable horrors and massacres perpetrated with 
impunity by armed political and military factions. 
  The government also deplores the unexplainable indifference 
shown by the international community, which seems to have opted 
to turn its back on the immense Rwandan tragedy, while under 
other skies huge resources have been deployed to reduce 
prevailing tensions and to extinguish the fires of conflict. 
  The Republic of Zaire calls on all peace and justice loving 
countries to coordinate their efforts to bring Rwandans back to 
understanding, concord, and peace. Zaire asks all the nations 
of the world to use every means at their disposal to persuade 
the Rwandan brothers to turn their backs on the dark path of war 
and tread back on the bright path of dialogue and discussion, 
which is the token of a just and lasting peace. 
  The meeting started at 1000 and ended at 1500. Thank you.

  [Text] At a plenary session in Lusaka, Zambia, today, 
delegations from the government and the National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] reached an agreement on 
specific principles for the conclusion of the second round of 
presidential elections. The second round of presidential 
elections will take place under the terms established by the 
National Assembly. Our reporter in Lusaka Alves Antonio closely 
followed the event. 
  [Begin Antonio recording] Good evening! At a plenary session 
today negotiating teams from the government and UNITA finally 
approved the eight points of the specific principles for the 
conclusion of presidential elections. The second round of 
presidential elections will take place on a date set by the 
National Assembly, after a declaration by the United Nations 
that conditions stipulated by law have been created. Other 
conditions required for the implementation of this process 
include security guarantees, free movement of people and goods, 
and people's freedom throughout the national territory. Sources 
close to the talks told Luanda Radio that it was not easy to 
approve the document [words indistinct] open and constructive 
discussions from the negotiating teams from the government and 
UNITA, even experienced periods of despair. 
  Also regarding the conclusion of the second round of 
presidential elections, the negotiating teams from the 
government and UNITA now have, until 3 May, the task of 
preparing documents dealing with modalities for the 
implementation of this process. 
  Meanwhile, a source close to the talks once again stressed 
the sense of responsibility demonstrated by the government 
negotiating team, which has been acting with flexibility and, 
above all, with prudence. [end recording]

  [Text] Despite the peace efforts under way in the Zambian 
capital, the communist Luanda regime continues to sow terror 
inside Angola. In the area of N'dalatando, the capital of 
Cuanza Norte Province, the regime's troops are still trying to 
occupy the city. However, the People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are meeting with a firm response 
from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
[UNITA] forces. Our correspondent reports on the situation over 
the last 48 hours. 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] 1. The enemy 
forces have over the last 48 hours tried to recover the body of 
(van den Berg), a South African mercenary who was killed on 26 
April; 
  2. In their first attempt on 27 April, the defeated FAPLA 
forces left another seven soldiers confirmed killed on the 
ground. There were also indications that several wounded men 
may have been dragged away from the battleground as the Luanda 
regime's forces fled in disarray [words indistinct] ammunition 
belt, and a number of rucksacks with assorted equipment; 
  3. At 0730 on 28 April, the enemy once again tried to get 
near the area. They used three T-55 tanks and intense fire from 
three Luanda air force combat fighters to provide cover for the 
FAPLA forces. Those aircraft dropped phosphorus and napalm 
bombs. The fire caused by those bombs could be seen some 40 km 
away. Our forces on the ground say they saw fresh vegetation 
burning and an area of 600 square meters was completely burned. 
  There were no victims, thanks to our forces' technical and 
tactical skills, and now the siege is tightening. 
  4. Taking into account the human and material losses that 
Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace is suffering in its attempt to 
recover the body of (Van den Berg), the aforementioned South 
African mercenary, we can only assume that he must have been a 
very important person. The forces of the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola government will experience even more 
losses, should they continue to [word indistinct] lives. The 
morale of the brave Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
could not be higher and they are determined to see that the 
watchword is observed in this province: whether it is attacked 
from land or from the air, N'dalatando will not fall. 
N'dalatando is with UNITA. N'dalatando is with Dr. Jonas 
Malheiro Savimbi. N'dalatando is with the patriots. [end

  [Text] Harare May 1 SAPA -- Zimbabwe Minister of Finance Dr 
Bernard Chidzero has been readmitted to hospital, the ZIANA news 
agency reported on Sunday [1 May]. He was in Harare's Avenues 
Clinic but it was not known when he was admitted. The senior 
minister, architect of Zimbabwe's economic reforms, collapsed on 
October 19 last year while dictating notes to his secretary. Dr 
Chidzero was treated in Harare and London before resuming duty 
at the end of January when he was reported to be working 
mornings only on doctor's orders.

  [Text] Klerksdorp April 29 SAPA -- Right-wingers in Western 
Transvaal mining towns are hastily selling their possessions and 
buying caravans, apparently to move to Hartswater, also in the 
Western Transvaal, to join their Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging 
[AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] counterparts before the 
election results are released. A second-hand furniture dealer 
told of several families, especially in Stilfontein and Orkney, 
who were selling off all their furniture in such a hurry they 
were accepting any price. 
  Meanwhile, several other right-wingers in Klerksdorp who 
intend staying have been barricading their homes, sometimes 
welding thick steel plates on bedroom windows to discourage 
intruders. 
  Some of the houses looked like fortresses and contained 
enough emergency supplies to last a long time.

<F P=106> [By Angela Quintal] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg March 29 SAPA -- Three senior Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance] officials were 
among 33 right-wingers who appeared in the Johannesburg regional 
court on Friday [29 April] in connection with bomb attacks in 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region since 
Sunday. 
  AWB chief-of-staff Josias Alexander van Cruywagen, 
Ystergaarde [Iron Guard] Commander Leon van der Merwe and the 
organisation's executive secretary Nico Prinsloo were among the 
accused. 
  Assistant Police Constable Hercules Jacobus Coetsee and 
police reservist Andreas Coetzee also face charges ranging from 
19 counts of murder, 191 counts of attempted murder, vehicle 
theft, malicious damage to property and charges under the arms 
and ammunition and explosives acts. 
  A 34th accused, Mr P Koekemoer, could not attend the hearing 
because he was in a Rustenburg hospital after being shot in a 
foot. 
  The accused packed the courtroom, dressed casually rather 
than in AWB uniforms, and occupied benches brought in to expand 
the dock. The group included a father and son, both named 
Cornelius Johannes Botha. 
  Relatives and friends, including AWB leader Eugene 
Terreblanche's brother Andries, sat in the public gallery and a 
large contingent of local and foreign media jammed the courtroom. 
  The men, many in their late teens and early 20s, were not 
asked to plead and State Advocate Brink Ferreira requested that 
they be remanded in custody until July 10. 
  Counsel for the defence, represented by Advocates H L 
Prinsloo and H van der Walt and Attorney Fanie van Vuuren, 
argued that proper consultation with their clients for a bail 
application was impossible because the charge sheet did not 
provide sufficient detail. They submitted that according to the 
interim constitution every person had the right to information 
in the possession of the state or its agents to protect their 
rights. 
  They also submitted that because bail was a fundamental 
right 
protected by the constitution, the accused were entitled to bail 
unless the state could prove on a balance of probabilities that 
the granting of bail was not in the interests of justice. 
  Mr Ferreira argued that the constitutional provisions to the 
right to information applied only to accused on trial. As they 
had yet to plead to charges the provision could not apply. 
  Magistrate C J van Heerden ordered the state to provide 
additional information so the defence could prepare for the bail 
application. He added that, according to the constitution, the 
state had the burden of convincing the court on a balance of 
probabilities why bail should not be granted. 
  After a short adjournment the state expanded on the charge 
sheet, saying six of the murder charges related to the Bree 
Street, Johannesburg, car bombing on March 24, a further eight 
murder charges related to the bomb in Germiston on March 25 and 
the rest to a bombing in Bloed Street, Pretoria, later the same 
day. 
  The vehicle theft charges related to cars used in the three 
bombings. 
  Details of the identity of the deceased would be given to 
the 
defence once the information became available, Mr Brink said. 
  The 34 accused were facing charges in their personal 
capacity 
and as part of a conspiracy. 
  Mr van Heerden then ruled the bail application should be 
heard in the Johannesburg regional court on May 16 and that the 
accused be remanded in custody until then. 
  Another of the accused, who cannot be named because he is a 
minor, appeared briefly in court after the main hearing. He was 
released into the care of his mother and was warned to report 
twice a day to the Rustenburg police station. 
  The other accused, from Randfontein, Carletonville, 
Ventersdrop, Rustenburg and Pretoria, include: Clint Ellish, 
Abraham Liebenberg Myburg, Pieter Daniel van der Merwe, Nicolaas 
Clifton Barnard, Jan Antonie Oelofse, Serge Marie Joseph 
Dabbabie, Douglas Pieter Taylor, Gerhard William Antonius 
Elbers, Dirk Jacobus Coetzee Meyer, Marthinus Albertus Deysel, 
Nelson George Woutberg, Gustav Woutberg, Gert Kruger Jacobus 
Albert, Louis Johannes Fouri, Hermanus Steyn Luyt, Theunis van 
Schalkwyk, Andries Wilhemus Nel, Milestone Sharp, Zacharius 
Johannes Beneke, Willem Frans Johannes Hattingh, J P Olivier, 
Jacobus Petrus Nel, Johannes Coenraad Smit, Pieter Duvenhage and 
Roelof Johannes Fouche.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 29 SAPA -- A 19-year-old police 
constable, held up by a motorist he confronted at Jan Smuts 
Airport, had a narrow escape on Friday [29 April] morning when 
the motorist produced a gun and pulled the trigger while 
pointing it at the policeman's stomach. The gun failed to fire. 
  Constable Stephan Botha had been manning a roadblock at the 
airport's entrance when a yellow Toyota Hi-Ace [minibus], 
bearing the registration NYY301T showed no signs of intending to 
stop, according to a police report. After the failed attempt 
had been made on the policeman's life, Constable Botha managed 
to hit the motorist in the face with the butt of his firearm 
after which the man ran away. Two other occupants of the 
vehicle also tried to run away. "But Constable Jaco Botha, also 
19, and Sgt Michael Brennen, 25, managed to arrest them," said 
the report. 
  Two 9mm pistols, magazines and ammunition were recovered 
from 
the vehicle which had been robbed from its owner in Isando 
shortly before the incident.

leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Sunday [1 May] missed church and 
was advised to stay at home because of a bout of influenza, 
KwaZulu government spokesman Mr T C Memela said. Mr Buthelezi 
travelled through rural areas of Zululand on Friday in cold 
weather which probably led to his poor health at the weekend, Mr 
Memela said. He said it was difficult to predict whether the 
IFP leader would be at work on Monday, but he would probably 
have time to rest because of the delayed election results from 
KwaZulu/Natal.

Kriegler...and his view was immediately endorsed by the leaders 
of the two main political parties, Mr F W de Klerk and Mr 
Mandela." So begins Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in English on 1 
May in a page-24 editorial. "However, in looking forward it is 
necessary to hold in mind the lessons of the monumental 
incompetence with which the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] conducted these elections. Those lessons, by no 
coincidence, confirm the message transmitted by the breakdown of 
the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. In both cases, we 
flirted with disaster. Both institutions sprang from a 
suspicion, more prevalent among political elites than among the 
people at large, that no institution of government can be 
trusted if it seems to represent the old regime. Behind the 
formation of the NPKF lay a naive belief that ill-trained and 
ill-disciplined irregulars could be welded in a matter of weeks 
into a professional army." "Similarly, the IEC was born of 
distrust of the Department of Home Affairs, the only institution 
in the country which -- with the backing of the SA Police and 
the SADF [South African Defense Force] -- might have conducted 
orderly, properly controlled elections. The attempt to create 
an `independent' substitute organisation, as it turned out, 
became more of a threat to the transition than a help." "As Mr 
de Klerk is fond of saying, we only have one SADF, one police 
force, and one civil service. We also have, more amorphously, 
only one business class. Whether the government of national 
unity is to have any hope of satisfying the reasonable 
expectations of the people who, in their millions, have given it 
a mandate, depends on these existing institutions. The callow 
socialist ideologues who surround Mr Mandela have had two vivid 
demonstrations of what happens when they, unlettered and 
inexperienced, try to `organise' and `plan' the life of the 
nation. They are incompetent to do so." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  National Election Victory Urged -- Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 25 April asks in a page-10 editorial: "Can our 
country's largest so-called liberation movement be given the 
mandate to govern the country for the next few years? Four 
years ago we would have given an unconditional no. Since then 
the ANC has changed in fundamental aspects. Policies and 
reasonable statements give one courage for the future. The 
negotiations also showed how sensible people could change 
radical views and find one another. But in other ways, 
unfortunately, the ANC remains unchanged. They remain in 
coalition with the South African Communist Party... and the 
virus of debilitating socialism thus remains part of the ANC." 
The National Party has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis and 
shown that it is representative of all groups in the country. 
"The values for which this changed party stands are those with 
which we can most easily identify. Its leader is a person of 
integrity and vision who helped create a new South Africa of 
justice and full participation. He deserves support in order 
for him to complete his task, and therefore we recommend him and 
his party," concludes BEELD. 
  Bombers Cannot Stop Change--BEELD on 26 April says in a 
page-12 editorial that "those cowardly murderers who believe 
they can stop the approach of democracy in South Africa with 
their bombing campaign are busy unleashing a rage unknown among 
the vast majority of South Africans. It is a rage which totally 
counters what the bombers are trying to achieve. It is uniting 
South Africans across all barriers as seldom seen before against 
violence and bloodshed." "The bombings have cost valuable lives 
and caused extensive damage to property, and that cannot be 
tolerated." "One realizes that the security forces are 
stretched very thinly on the ground at present," but "the 
present situation demands drastic action. The country expects 
the same decisive action to be taken as was the case in the 
eighties when destabilization came from the other side of the 
political spectrum. Activists and instigators were rounded up 
then, regardless of who they were. The same medicine is needed 
now." 
  CP Losing All Its Decent Leaders -- "The Conservative Party 
[CP] is systematically losing all the reasonable, decent people 
within its leadership," states a second editorial on the same 
page of the 26 April BEELD. "The latest are Messrs Driew Bruwer 
and Thomas Langley, who walked over to General Constand 
Viljoen's Freedom Front [FF] after they were reassured about the 
negotiations process through the accord signed at the weekend 
between the front, the government, and the ANC. This accord, 
which confirms the front's right to negotiate for a homeland, 
does not guarantee that it will be achieved. That will depend 
on the strength of the argument and its practicality." "The CP 
leaders trickling over to the FF are apparently only the tip of 
the iceberg. Beneath the surface there is no doubt a much 
greater movement of reasonable people who wish to follow the 
decent path. All that will remain then will be the diehard CP 
members who are unable to negotiate anything for themselves."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Inefficient Election--"Give or take a few rough edges," the 
South African election will probably be "a fair reflection of 
the broad will of the people," notes an editorial in the 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 2 May on page 12. However, 
"too many foreign observers" assessed the polls "as remarkable 
and then added the rider `...by African standards.'" "A cold 
assessment of the election will not cast a particularly 
complimentary light on its administrators, the IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission]." Voting was "chaotic in some areas," as 
"vast numbers of ballot papers went missing and the required 
voting equipment just did not arrive." "Crisis management" was 
supplied as "the Government, the National Peace Secretariat and 
others came to the IEC's rescue." "The new South Africa could be 
born into a culture of sloppiness -- where crisis management 
becomes a way of life. During the transition to democracy it was 
sometimes necessary to bend the rules, to turn a blind eye. In 
the interests of good government and an ordered society, that 
must not be repeated." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Journalists Coverage of Election -- As the media "definition 
of news" is "that which is unusual," says the editorial in 
Johannesburg SOWETAN on 2 May, "it is therefore not susprising 
that they have turned the attention of the country to what went 
wrong during the election. We have written extensively about 
problems with the delivery of material to voting stations, the 
late starts at polling stations, the problems at the counting 
centres and the painful struggle to get the results out." "The 
only sad thing is that we might have shifted the focus away from 
the great things achieved in a short week of history-making." 
"We did not make a noise about the IEC's achievements." And the 
rightwing strategy to disrupt the elections "went terribly 
wrong. It seems its potential threat to a democratic South 
Africa was overblown or only in the imagination of foreign 
journalists." "It is now history that last week's four days of 
polling were the most peaceful in South Africa in years." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Loyal Opposition -- "By next week we will have swapped 
one-party rule for what might be no more than two-party power 
sharing in a government of national unity," notes an editorial 
headlined "Election Comment -- the Editor" in Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 2 May on page 1. "Ironically the Nats 
[National Party] will be cast in the role of a loyal opposition, 
loyal to the extent that party members will be in the Cabinet 
and will be jointly responsibile with ANC members for Cabinet 
decisions." "While the totalitarian impluse might be to dismiss 
the small parties as irrelevant, the contributions the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party], Freedom Front and DP [Democratic Party] 
can make should not be overlooked. They might be thorns in the 
government's flesh and some might represent fairly narrow 
interests, but their opposition must be viewed as constructive 
if the country is to succeed in its quest for national 
reconciliation." The "different factions" of the ANC are 
expected to "hold together" and to "continue to do so for a 
while, reaping popular support from Nelson Mandela." "Eventually 
the ANC will need to develop a role as a broadly popular party 
of the center capable of building a strong economy while 
retaining mass support," however "this may eventually cost the 
party a radical wing which tires of power-sharing." "Making the 
transition will be a necessary foundation for the country's 
future stability. It will be made easier if the concept of a 
loyal opposition is acknowledged for the first time in decades." 
  New Economic Era -- The country is poised to enter a new 
economic era, just as surely it is entering a new political 
one," notes an editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY on 2 May 
on page 12. "South Africans need and expect thoughtful economic 
stewardship just as they need and expect thoughtful political 
management. Without the first, the second cannot succeed." While 
the threats of inflation and recession remain, "sound economic 
stewardship" implies "fiscal incentives that encourage 
industrialists to expand and to create jobs." While funds have 
been promised from abroad, state borrowing cannot "force up 
interest rates to levels that halt industrial expansion. 
  Sound economic stewardship should, however, lead to growth 
rates that quickly expand the country's tax base. The conomic 
cake will then be big enough for eveyone to have a fair share."

<F P=106> [From the "Election '94" program] </F>
  [Text] The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] has 
confirmed that the target time for the completion of 
vote-counting is midnight tonight, with a few exceptions. This 
was announced by the chief director of election administration, 
Mr. Piet Colyn, at a news conference a short while ago. Mr. 
Colyn said the final provisional count would be made known by 
early tomorrow morning. He said good progress was being made 
and minor problems were being ironed out. 
  [Begin Colyn recording] By 5 o'clock this afternoon a high 
percentage of the counting will be completed. We have 
experienced problems with the counting, especially in two areas. 
The one area is where we have a voting venue comprising various 
voting stations. To give you examples: the one at Nasrec 
[National Exhibition Center], Pretoria show grounds, the 
exhibition center in Durban. These are well in progress now and 
those results will start coming in. The other area is the 
outlying parts of the country where you have tremendous 
logistical problems to do with counting. I'm confident that the 
counting of votes will more or less be completed by midnight 
tonight. We get positive reports from all over the country. 
  As far as Northern Transvaal is concerned, problems 
experienced there, I'm quite sure, they have been resolved now. 
We have sent in expert teams to assist it. And today we can 
specialize on those kinds of problems that we still experience 
and identify the particular individual voting station still 
experiencing problems, and send in teams to assist with the 
counting in those stations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC officials Pieter Cronje, Humphrey </F>
Khoza, and Kumi Naidoo at IEC headquarters at Gallagher Estate, 
Midrand -- live] 
  [Text] [Cronje] Good evening ladies and gentlemen. We have 
been getting in the election results of this election. At this 
stage, the results come from the Western Cape Province, but they 
are only for the National Assembly. As the results became 
available, what we will give you from Gallagher Estate at the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] Media Center, would be 
three components: provincial totals for the national ballot, in 
other words, the votes cast in the Western Cape, Northern Cape, 
and the remaining provinces for the national ballot. Secondly, 
we will give you the provincial ballots for the provincial 
legislatures, and thirdly, we will give you the overall total 
for the national ballot, the National Assembly. at the moment, 
just a repeat: We have only National Assembly ballots emanating 
from the Western Cape. There the latest results are as follows: 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], 112; Soccer Party, 8; Freedom 
Front, 641; Workers' List Party, 4; Women's Rights Peace Party, 
3; Ximoko Progressive Party, 4; African Christian Democratic 
Party, 150; African Democratic Movement, 3; African Moderates 
Congress Party, 15; African Muslim Party, 25; ANC, 4,696; DP 
[Democratic Party], 544; Dikwankwetla Party of South Africa, 12; 
Federal Party, 21; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], 132; the Keep It 
Straight and Simple Party, 24; LUSAP [Luso-SA Party], 13; 
Minority Front, 34; NP [National Party], 14,436 
  The rejected ballots number 184. 
  [Khoza] Let me give you an overview of the regional reports 
with regard to the counting process, as it continues. You will 
recall that at an earlier briefing we did say that we had some 
human resource, or staff, or personnel problems at the counting 
centers in Queenstown and Umtata in the Eastern Cape. We are 
pleased that staff at Queenstown sub-regional office have gone 
back to work and at Umtata there has been an acceptance of the 
agreement in principle, and therefore counting started at 5PM 
this afternoon. 
  In KwaZakhele, as I promised to report, the allegation of 
tempering with ballot boxes is still being investigated and the 
South African Police are involved. 
  Empangeni -- we have a technical error there in that the 
lines are down, therefore we cannot be fed with information. I 
just want to emphasize that that does not necessarily say work 
or counting is not continuing. It's just that we cannot be 
accessed. Newcastle as a center -- Vryheid and Ngotje are still 
reconciling. In North-West Mafikeng Center, the center is still 
trying to address its staffing problems. We have problems with 
staff at the Mafikeng center as well. 
  In Schweizer-Reneke, Vryburg, Bloemhom and Delareyville 
counting is continuing. In Christiana counting is continuing, 
and it is believed that results are imminent. Khanyetsa -- they 
are not counting as yet, but reconciliation is continuing. In 
Taung and Kuruman they are at the reconciliation stage. In the 
Northern Transvaal, Thohoyandou Center, reconciliation was 
completed in Messina and they are awaiting confirmation to 
proceed with the counting. In Soutpansberg reconciliation has 
just begun. It is estimated that the process should be 
completed by 7PM this evening. In Phalaborwa reconciliation has 
begun. No stations have started counting as yet. Ellisrus -- 
still reconciling, counting is imminent, and I will hand over to 
my colleague, Kumi, to give you an updated situation as far as 
the Nasrec Center [National Exhibition Center] is concerned. 
  [Naidoo] Judge Kriegler, Mrs. Helen Suzman, and 
representatives of the major political parties met at Nasrec 
this afternoon where votes for the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] province are being counted, to discuss difficulties 
around the reconciliation process which has delayed the start of 
the count. The reconciliation is acknowledged to be a cause for 
concern. In order not to delay the counting in this important, 
most populous region in the country, which should be under way 
already, a working system as agreed -- whereby the ballots which 
can be reconciled, will be reconciled -- allowing the counting 
to begin immediately. In the interim each party will appoint a 
representative to a team which with the IEC will deal with all 
problem cases, dissolve as any as possible by agreement, and put 
the ballots into the count. A second team will deal with the 
more problematic cases where agreement could not be reached, and 
continue to try to find agreement on these cases. 
  Meanwhile, all objections are being noted and will be lodged 
with the IEC to be dealt with at headquarters. The results that 
become available will be tally figures before the resolution of 
disputes. The IEC appeals to party officials to cooperate with 
the IEC in getting the answers to the voters as expeditiously as 
possible. 
  [Cronje] Ladies and gentlemen, we discussed the situation at 
the Mitchell's Plain counting center, where at a previous 
briefing we announced that over half of the total votes will be 
handled. I have an update for you that an agreement was reached 
between the IEC and the parties there. They are expediting the 
process of reconciliation. Instead of the counting officers 
checking individual boxes from voting stations against the 
counterfoils, the counting officers will receive the boxes, 
count the papers, and keep the totals, and then transfer that 
straight into party support, but while doing this a group of 
auditors will sit with the tallies from the first count and they 
will use those tallies as a check for the counterfoils. The 
counting officers will give the results from the boxes and the 
auditors will then give their count of the reconciliation.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler, </F>
international commissioner Professor Walter Kamba, and official 
Pieter Cronje at the IEC media center at Gallagher Estate in 
Midrand -- live] 
  [Text] [Kriegler] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. The 
question that's being asked is: Where are we now? I'd like to 
deal with that and answer questions afterwards from anybody who 
wants further clarity. An election consists basically of three 
phases: the voting phase, the counting phase, and the 
calculation phase. We are now in the counting phase where the 
millions of ballots that were cast are being reconciled and 
counted. I'm aware of the fact that there is impatience. I 
have a great deal of sympathy with that, but I must say that 
from the first press interview that I held months ago I have 
been at pains to meet precisely this impatience. We have said 
in the IEC, from day one, it is going to take time to do the 
counting and it is taking time, and we're not worried about 
that. It must take time. 
  Let us get a few things clear. Number one, this is a 
people's election like this country has never seen. It involves 
the remotest villages in the far reaches of Venda, to the green 
hills of Zululand, now KwaZulu, to the mountains and crags of 
the Transkei, and for the very self-same reasons that it is 
difficult to get the ballots out there, it is difficult to get 
them back. It's not unexpected and it's not alarming. It is 
simply an inevitable consequence of the election that we are 
involved in. That is why we at the IEC have consistently said, 
be patient. Now the very transportation and communication and 
logistical problems that resulted in our starting late with the 
voting, have had a knock-on effect on the counting which is 
obvious. You can't start counting till all of the voting has 
been done. The very self-same communications problems in 
getting the ballots out there, up into the hills, are 
encountered in getting them back again, and you can't start 
counting until you've got all of them back. That takes time. 
  Moreover, it's not only a people's election in terms of the 
electorate. It was made clear from the outset that this was to 
be an election for all South Africans, run by all South 
Africans. That means that there are tens of thousands of people 
involved in the process who have never been involved in such a 
process before. There are tens of thousands out there who have 
difficulty in dealing with the painstaking accounting processes 
involved in making a return in respect of an election. 
  That has caused us problems. I tell you that frankly. 
ballot boxes have been returned not in a meticulous fashion. 
Also in many places, because of the very nature of the election 
where we had no voters' roll, the turnout at some voting 
stations was very much higher than anybody had anticipated, and 
that resulted in the voting process being overloaded. One of 
the problems was that the ballot boxes became overfull. Some 
presiding officers, using commendable initiative, took emergency 
measures at the time, emptied that ballot box into a container 
and replaced the ballot box in the voting station to enable the 
people to exercise their democratic right to vote. 
  Now to a meticulous election administrator, opening a ballot 
box in the voting station is a surprising step to take. The 
presiding officers in those voting stations had a choice. They 
either had to turn the voters away, or they had to make a plan, 
and they made a plan, and that plan is not such a bad plan in 
retrospect. The alternative would have been much worse. The 
people were patient, but if there had been further blockages in 
the voting process, the consequences could have been grave. But 
this means that when you get to the counting stage, you've got a 
problem at the outset where you have to do a reconciliation of 
ballot papers issued to the presiding officer, ballot papers 
returned with votes cast, rejected ballot papers where people 
have asked for a new one because they had made a mistake on the 
first one, and unused returned ballot papers. 
  Now where you have not got the ballots in a sealed box, that 
return is of relatively little value, and the reconciliation 
becomes very, very difficult. I went to Nasrec [National 
Exhibition Center] this afternoon, which is a very big counting 
station, and I took the opportunity to go to each of the 
counting points in that complex and explained to the party 
representatives there gathered, and to all of the officials of 
the IEC, that what is important is to get the count done. The 
reconciliation, which is so complex in these circumstances, 
should take a back seat. What is important is that the people 
who have voted now want to hear the results. 
  It means, and I put it bluntly, it means departing from the 
prescribed procedure, the prescribed procedure which is a 
carefully worked out set of returns that must balance with one 
another. But the IEC resolves this afternoon, that the counting 
process cannot be held up by these reconciliation procedures. 
And I want to explain why we did so, and why we think that it 
is the best in the circumstances. Our Electoral Act is a very 
strange document and provides for a truly unique election. In 
the first instance of course it's unique to us because we've 
never had a proportional representational election in the 
country at all. Those of us who have been privileged to vote 
have known a constituency based election. This is a different 
type of election. 
  In the second place, and more significantly, this is an 
election in which nobody was obliged to vote at a particular 
voting station. You could vote at the point of your choice. So 
there could be no prediction as to how many people could be 
anticipated at any one voting station. In the third instance, 
nobody really knew what the extent of the electorate was. The 
statistics were the subject of a great deal of debate, and on 
virtually only one thing the statisticians could agree, and that 
nobody could be certain within reasonable tolerances. 
  The experience of the last few days would indicate that most 
of those estimates were substantially too low. I put that 
guardedly, advisedly, because that impression may not eventually 
prove to have been valid. But the most important unique feature 
of this election is that there was no voters' roll. Therefore, 
the ordinary kind of return rendered by a presiding officer was 
of very, very limited value. If I could use the image of 
plotting a point on map, you really need three lines to cross 
before you've got a reasonably accurate fixing of that point. 
Two lines get you nowhere and one line is totally useless. 
  Now what we have here is a return by the presiding officer 
of 
the ballots issued to him, and a return eventually of the 
ballots he brings back to the counting station, broken down into 
those votes cast, those not used, and those spoilt. And it 
gladdens a bureaucrat's heart to see that reconciliation, but 
upon analysis it tells you nothing of any consequence. Unless 
you have an accurate indication of the people who had voted, you 
do not have the third line in order to plot your point. If I 
can make it as plain as I can, all that reconciliation tells you 
is what the presiding officer received, and what he is giving 
back, but it doesn't tell you how many ballots he is giving back 
with votes cast by voters. He is giving you a return of the 
seats and returns, and nothing else. Unless and until you can 
check that against a voters' roll, or possibly a turnstile which 
would give you numbers of people that entered, you do not have 
real verification. 
  Each and every ballot cast must have on the back of it the 
identifying stamp of that voting station. Without that stamp 
that ballot is automatically rejected. That is a safeguard 
against someone who does not have access to the stamp stuffing 
the ballot box. 
  But of course there is nothing in the procedure that 
prevents a corrupt presiding officer from putting the stamps on 
the back of ballots that he fills in to his or her choice. But 
that is the process we've got, and that is the process that the 
act creates, and that's the one we've got to live with. You are 
reliant upon the integrity and the fear of detection of the 
presiding officer, the vigilance of the party agents and of the 
others in the voting station. Reconciliation in those 
circumstances is of minimal value. It is of course so that it is 
a safeguard against him removing ballot papers, but then he 
could replace them with others at will if he wished to be 
dishonest. That is why we said, inasmuch as so many 
inexperienced people had rendered defective returns and inasmuch 
as the reconciliation rarely served, ultimately, no real 
purpose. If you can reconcile, by all means do so, and if you 
can't reconcile, note each one of the defects, note the 
objections of the parties, if any, if they can't resolve it, and 
carry on with the counting, because what is announced is not the 
result but the tally and that tally, we at the IEC will have to 
evaluate in the light of the nature and extent of the 
imperfections and the reconciliation process, the nature and the 
extent of the objections, and the degree to which the parties 
may have agreed in respect of some of it. That is calculated to 
shorten the procedure with minimal risk to the veracity of the 
result. If I can put it this way: As far as we are concerned, 
the election is about national reconciliation, not ballot 
reconciliation. Let's forget about the formalities. Let's get 
on with finding out what the people said they want. Thank you. 
  [Cronje] Thank you, Judge Kriegler. Could I hand over to 
Professor Walter Kamba, one of the IEC's international 
commissioners, to give you his opinion on this election? Prof. 
Kamba. 
  [Kamba] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. May I start by 
saying this has been a remarkable election -- remarkable in a 
number of ways. Firstly, in relation to its magnitude, its 
size. Secondly, in relation to the circumstances in which the 
election is being held. It has been a mammoth task never seen 
before -- organized by a nation. The size of the bureaucracy 
that has had to be established in so short a time is absolutely 
incredible, and the commission has been mandated with the 
responsibility of running such an enormous event within a very 
short time, putting up such a large size of civil servants, if 
one may call them that, a lot of them with no experience 
whatsoever in running an election. The logistical arrangements 
that have had to be made have been equally of enormous size and 
the sheer logistics of getting polling stations, counting 
stations, delivery of various material, has been of enormous 
size, and the commission is very much aware that there has been 
a lot of imperfections. But if you take into account those 
factors that I have indicated, and also the manner in which a 
number of issues have been chopped and changed as we proceeded 
to the final stage, have added enormous difficulties to the 
whole process. 
  Reports from you of how the actual voting process proceeded 
were characterized by the great commitment, the enthusiasm, the 
determination of the voters to go to the polls, and their 
attitude which they have reflected -- how they regarded this as 
a major event in their lives, particularly those who were 
first-time voters, but even those who had votes before -- they 
had never voted in any election of this kind. This is a 
national event to which the nation is committed, and the mandate 
of the IEC was really to deliver this election in the most 
difficult of circumstances, so when one comes to evaluate the 
election one must evaluate it in that context, and those who 
have complaints must really channel the complaints along the 
procedures that have been indicated, so that those complaints 
can be looked into and be added to the factors that have to be 
taken into account in coming to a final decision. The 
fundamental element in the election is to ensure that the 
country, its voters, have expressed their view in an atmosphere 
in which there is virtually no violence, virtually no 
intimidation, and we have seen, we have witnessed, the 
environment in which voters have streamed to the polls. It has 
been clear that whatever violence that existed prior to the 
actual polling process was almost absent when it came to the 
voters expressing their view. 
  Procedures have been set up to deal with the question of 
counting, to deal with how you handle ballot boxes, how they 
should be submitted. I think we have set up adequate procedures 
to ensure that each vote that is counted can be said to be a 
valid vote, and that, I think, to me and to the commission, is 
what is of fundamental importance. If at the end of the day we 
can say the votes that were cast -- the votes that all parties 
who attend the counting centers -- can themselves agree the 
valid votes were in fact so, and that this determines the 
ultimate result of the elections. [sentence as heard] And I, as 
one of the international members who had participated in the 
process, I think we have done what we can to reinforce the 
impartiality, the independence, of the electoral commission, and 
to the extent humanly possible, to ensure that at the end of the 
day we can say the votes cast were valid votes, and represent 
the choice of the people of South Africa. Thank you. 
  [Cronje] Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will ask you 
to identify yourself please. At this stage, to give everyone a 
fair chance, limited to one question, no supplementaries please. 
Can we start? Karen? 
  [Correspondent Karen Bruinaard] My question is directed to 
Mr. Justice Kriegler. Sir, you took a very bold step, if I am 
correct, in deciding to overthrow a very important safety 
precaution, when you decided not to take reconciliation into 
account in certain circumstances. My question is: Will this 
speed up the process? On the other hand, we saw tonight that 
more or less one percent of the total vote has been counted so 
far. When do you expect a tally, or even a final outcome? 
Could it be before Friday? Thank you. 
  [Kriegler] I take it that both questions were facetious. If 
I didn't make it plain, I will do so afterwards. I don't want 
to take up time unnecessarily. I will explain precisely why it 
is not a valuable safeguard at all. It is no safeguard at all 
if you haven't got a voters' roll or a count, an independent 
count of voters, but we can debate it afterwards. With regard 
to the second, most certainly before Friday. 
  [Cronje] Pierre? 
  [Correspondent Pierre Classen] Can I also address the judge 
please? Could you tell us, in making this modification to the 
procedures, did you get the approval or condoning of the parties 
concerned, and do you think that after the result they will 
still in a good spirit accept your decision in this matter? 
  [Kriegler] Did you say the last.... 
  [Classen, interrupting] The political parties, and after the 
result, do you think they will still accept your decision in 
this matter in good spirit? 
  [Kriegler] I have no doubt that they will. They, the 
politicians, know precisely what the minimal value is of the 
process as it is, and I discussed with a committee out at Nasrec 
[National Exhibition Center] this afternoon, I discussed it with 
some of the major parties. Quite frankly, it's a decision that 
the IEC has to take and has to live with, and I am happy that I 
can justify it to any political party. 
  [Cronje] Over here please. 
  [Correspondent Michael Collins] Kind of the same question. 
Before the election there were a number of safeguards that were 
apparently deemed necessary -- the printing of special ballots 
with counterfoils outside the country, the fact that ballot 
boxes would remain sealed, the fact that reconciliation was to 
take place. With all of these revised because of the 
circumstances of the election, are you confident that there is 
no chance for fraud on a significant scale, and do you believe 
that the parties, especially the parties that are not the main 
two parties, who have already been making allegations of 
irregularities, will accept this as a legitimate revision of the 
Electoral Act? 
  [Kriegler] I am indeed satisfied, and the commission is 
satisfied, that provided a ballot bears the official mark of the 
particular voting station, the prospect of there being 
significant fraud is very small indeed. 
  [Cronje] Anton Fisher? 
  [Correspondent Anton Fisher] Judge, I wanted to ask you -- 
the sort of shifting reconciliation to the back seat and the 
modifications that have been mentioned -- how do you think this 
is going to impact on the credibility of the election and the 
announcement of a free and fair election? 
  [Kriegler] That's precisely why I'm here -- to answer each 
and every question about it, because we are satisfied that it 
does not affect the credibility, and we wish to take the people 
with us in that belief. It is not a decision we took lightly. 
We think we took it correctly. We are happy to debate that 
decision and to establish to the satisfaction of anybody that it 
is a responsible decision. 
  [Cronje] Annette? 
  [Correspondent Annette Joubert] My question centers around 
the question: What happened to the [Orange] Free State's 
results? Apparently they have finished already at 1030 this 
morning. We have heard nothing. What happened in the Northern 
Cape? There are only approximately 500,000 voters. Where are 
the results? And then, what is happening to the special 
ballots.... 
  [Kriegler, interrupting] Would you mind not having a go at 
me 
with a shotgun? I'll come back to you, by all means. I simply 
can't remember so many questions at once. 
  [Joubert] Do you not know what's happened to the results in 
the Free State, because we've had reports since this morning 
that the results have been available since 1030, and...? 
  [Kriegler, interrupting] No, no results from any voting 
station has been available. I don't want to be clever. Tallies 
have come in, and we do not wish to put out tallies, even 
tallies from the head office, until we have checked them 
ourselves. Those figures can go out for public information. 
We're happy with that. But we're verifying them as tallies 
first. 
  [Joubert] Just the last part of the question. What is 
happening to the overseas ballot papers at this stage? 
  [Kriegler] I really can't tell you. They should all have 
arrived by now, but I'm not sure. 
  [Cronje] Linda? 
  [Correspondent Linda van Tilburgh] We've been on air for 
quite some time with the results, but it's rather going slow. 
To pick up on Karen's question, do you think it will go faster 
now? Will we have results rolling in by tomorrow, sort of 
creating more excitement than it is now? 
  [Kriegler] I'm glad you asked the question. I owe you an 
apology. I was sharp with you the other day, and I shouldn't 
have been. I'm sorry. The process is certainly coming on 
stream. Quite apart from the ruling we made, the counting 
process is in any event calculated to speed up very rapidly as 
all of the counting stations get their preliminary work in 
order. You can expect a good deal more rapid returns coming on. 
  [Van Tilburgh] Can I just ask: from tonight, or from 
tomorrow? Because it will affect us staying on air tonight or 
not. 
  [Kriegler] Most of the counting stations are working through 
the night. 
  [Cronje] Over here, please? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Judge, first, why if the 
reconciliation process is so inconsequential, why was it put in 
the electoral law in the first place? And second, I mean, it's 
the latest of a series of creative interpretations of the 
electoral law. Don't you feel that maybe while you solve 
logistical problems and you speed up the process, you are in 
fact creating a political problem because -- never mind whether 
you are sure that it can't be tampered with -- people who won't 
like the election results might jump on this loophole to declare 
dissatisfaction with the election? 
  [Kriegler] With regard to your first question, why is the 
procedure in the electoral act if it has such minimal value -- 
it's a question I've asked myself, and I've come up with an 
answer: that the absence of a third coordinate and the 
significance thereof was not appreciated. Not one of the senior 
political representatives with whom we have debated the issue 
disagree with us on that. With regard to the second point, of 
course it is possible that particularly a loser will take this 
opportunity. It is possible. That is a risk we've got to run. 
I believe that the steps, in the circumstances, are so 
self-evidently correct that, A, there will be little temptation 
to resort to it as a peg on which to hang a declinature to 
proceed with the democratic process, and B, would be manifestly 
an unjustified resort to that particular step. I may say I 
sincerely trust that to some extent the integrity and 
impartiality of the commission will satisfy the broad body of 
the public out there that this was not done to benefit anybody 
or to prejudice anybody. Moreover, upon reflection, what we are 
postulating in order to be significant in a proportional 
representation system, is an undetected fraud of a massive scale 
committed by or in collusion with IEC officials. I think the 
prospects of that are pretty remote. 
  [Cronje] The gentleman right at the back. 
  [Correspondent Skwezi Skosana] Justice Kriegler, if I may 
ask: Are you satisfied about the manner in which the results are 
being flashed on the SABC screen and on the radio? The fact 
that the results -- they come in percentages -- is that not 
going to create a problem, especially to a fairly large majority 
of people out there who may not be able to interpret percentages 
without giving reference. For example, Western Cape results -- 
they came in as a percentage without giving reference whether 
they are from 10 counting stations, one counting station, or 
five. 
  [Kriegler] I share your view. I agree with you, and I have 
already asked that the data be presented in a different form. I 
will take it up again tonight when I get back to the office. 
  [Cronje] Radio (Populare). 
  [Correspondent Paolo Barnard] Judge Kriegler, one of your 
duties will be to declare these elections free and fair, and one 
may wonder how free you are to declare these elections free and 
fair. Surely, there must be a lot of pressure from the two main 
political parties here in this country and international 
community. I'm not implying for one second that your judgment 
will be conditioned by these pressures. I'm only asking you if 
you ever felt these pressures on you, especially from the 
international community. 
  [Kriegler] I am human and of course I'm subject to 
pressures. 
I don't take the decision alone, thank heavens, but I can assure 
you that the pressure of the situation is infinitely more than 
any political party could bring to bear. The realization is 
stark that if the election cannot be certified we are in a worse 
position than we were before the negotiation process started, 
and I would not be honest if I did not say that that realization 
falls very, very heavily on me. But I've got to live with 
myself after this election, and I will not certify if I am not 
satisfied that it was a substantially free and fair election as 
the statute obliges me to do, and I would like to add that I am 
not an auditor who has been called in with a green pen, green 
ink pen, to check on technical correctness. If that were my 
duty, I would have reported to the state president on Wednesday 
morning, that because of the logistical problems we had struck 
we would have to take measures which would be technically less 
than we would have required, and we shouldn't carry on. We 
decided that it was in the national interest to do the emergency 
printing and distribution that we did because we believed that 
that was the preferable cause to take, once we were staring at 
the possibility, on the one hand, of a possibly free and fair 
election, and on the other hand, possibly conflagration. We 
took the decision in the knowledge that there were risks. The 
risks on the other side were much greater and much more likely. 
  [Cronje] The gentleman over here please. 
  [Correspondent Themba Khumalo] Judge Kriegler, we have been 
told a few hours ago at an earlier briefing, that eight stations 
in Durban are not operating because of reconciliation problems. 
We have been told also that there are problems at Nasrec. 
Obviously people in Natal and in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regions are anxious to know which 
party wins and which party will lose. Are you not perhaps 
fearing that the delay of the announcement of results in certain 
regions might cause some problems in terms of people becoming 
angry? 
  [Kriegler] I wouldn't say that I fear it, but I am aware of 
the risk. That is precisely one of the reasons we have said: 
Speed up the process. We can't reconcile in many cases. Don't 
try the impossible. Get on with the count. Note the 
objections. We will deal with them. The people are entitled to 
know what the tallies are. I agree with you in that respect. 
  [Cronje] The gentleman over there, then Tim. 
  [Correspondent Tan Moyane] Good evening, Judge. I just want 
to take you back slightly ... 
  [Kriegler, interrupting] Can't you ask something of my 
colleague Walter, for a moment? [laughter] 
  [Moyane] In terms of the tallies that are coming in. Some of 
us are sitting here at Gallagher Estate and watching you on 
Channel IEC, information, and at the same time watching 
television. We have just seen a discrepancy. There is more 
coming out on TV than what we are seeing here, and from what you 
have said just now, are we going to see a speeded up process in 
which we get the results from all over? I mean for 90 minutes, 
from seven to half past eight, all we saw was Western Cape 
national ballot results, and when I came here, Mr. Pieter Cronje 
was giving us results about other regions, and we haven't seen 
them on the screen here. 
  [Kriegler] I am confident that the through-put of tallies 
from counting stations will materially pick up, yes, and I share 
your frustration, I may add. 
  [Cronje] Tim? 
  [Tim du Plessis] Mr. Kriegler, we have had a number of 
international organizations up here this afternoon, making all 
sorts of pronouncements on the elections -- some saying it's 
free and fair, some saying it's only free, but they were making 
pronouncements on the freeness and the fairness of the election. 
We've also had political organizations here saying those 
pronouncements were premature. What are your views on this? 
  [Kriegler] I did not see them. This I will say without fear 
of contradiction: The balloting phase of the election was free 
and it was fair. The counting phase is at the moment in 
progress. There is no reason to think that it won't be 
likewise. As far as the arithmetical calculation is concerned, 
the same applies. 
  [Cronje] The gentleman over there with the check shirt. 
  [Correspondent] Judge, any indication yet of the total 
number 
of people who have been to the polls? 
  [Kriegler] Pardon. 
  [Correspondent] Any indication yet of the total number of 
people that have been to the polls? 
  [Kriegler] No. No. Obviously one can't do that until you've 
got the final tallies in. That's one of the snags of not having 
a voter's roll.

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC officials Humphrey Khoza, Pieter </F>
Cronje, and Kumi Naidoo at the media center at Gallagher Estate 
in Midrand -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Khoza] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and 
good morning to you, South Africa. This morning, we are going 
to once again give you an update on the elections so far, 
particularly the counting process and progress. However, before 
we start I am pleased to say that we sincerely hope we will be 
getting here a number of commissioners to come and give you 
geographic details in terms of what happened during the voting 
process during the two, three days in some areas, and also bring 
you up to (?speed) about specifics of counting stations in their 
respective provinces. 
  Before we proceed I am now going to hand you over to my 
colleague on the extreme left, my left that is, Pieter Cronje, 
to give you the latest results as we have them. Over to you, 
Pieter. 
  [Cronje] Good morning. The latest results as at 11:14 AM for 
the National Assembly are as follows: PAC [Pan-Africanist 
Congress], 27,915; Soccer Party, 1,649; VF/FF 
[Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front], 95,994; WLP [Worker's List 
Party], 622; WRPP [Women's Rights Peace Party], 1,661; XPP 
[Ximoko Progressive Party], 677; ACDP [African Christian 
Democratic Party], 14,585; ADM [African Democratic Movement], 
1,073; AMCP [African Moderates Congress Party], 7,107; AMP 
[African Muslim Party], 3,087; ANC, 1,267,462; DP [Democratic 
Party], 62,771; DPSA [Dikwankwentla Party of South Africa], 
2,772; FP [Federal Party], 2,940; IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], 
70,364; KISS [Keep It Straight and Simple Party], 1,284; Lusap 
[LUSO-South African Party], 625; MF [Minority Front], 1,710; NP 
[National Party], 814,260; Rejected, 43,214. And the total, as 
at 11:14 AM today, 2,421,772. 
  I also have for you ladies and gentlemen a statement: 
Yesterday afternoon, the commission of the IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission] took an important decision to release 
results as soon as they became available. That is at a point at 
which the results were still formally unverifiable. The 
separation of the verification process from the process of 
compilation of the results was successfully completed by about 
10:00 PM last night. As a consequence of which the flow of 
results began to increase exponentially. Where the count had 
formerly stood at about 30,000 late yesterday afternoon, the 
position unverified, is presently approaching 5 million, 
enabling a clearer picture of trends to emerge, and we believe 
easing the minds of the electorate about the flow and ultimate 
success of this second stage of the electoral process. 
  Nevertheless, the commission is of the view that the process 
should be completed by tomorrow night, and further efforts are 
being made to speed up the process of delivering unverified 
results. The verification process continues as a parallel 
process, and the results of this process will be fed into the 
commission's determination of the freeness and fairness of the 
result. 
  Outstanding issues will continue to be dealt with after the 
formal announcement of the result, and these issues may cause 
minor, if not marginal adjustments to the final picture. Such 
adjustments are not expected to affect the overall picture. By 
last night this adjustment of the counting process had 
dramatically improved the flow of results to the electorate, and 
as things stand this morning results known are already showing 
the development of clear trends nationally and in certain 
provinces. 
  Three major provincial counting centers, those are Pretoria 
Show Grounds, and Nasrec [National Exhibition Center], in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region, and at the 
Durban Expo Center in Natal, are expected to begin delivering 
their results during the course of this morning. As these 
centers kick into the process, we expect the counting flow to 
increase substantially, moving the results process much closer 
to finalization. 
  There has also been some questions about the issue of 
reconciliation, and for an explanation of that I hand you to my 
colleague Kumi Naidoo. 
  [Naidoo] There have been several questions with regard to 
reconciliation. I will just read the questions out the way that 
they are put to us first, and then give you the response. The 
first question was.... 
  [Announcer Lester Venter, interrupting] We'll just take my 
voice over of what's happening at the press conference there, 
just to remind you that as far strictly the results are 
concerned, if you sense a small discrepancy in what we already 
know and what we hear from the IEC press conference, it is 
simply because by virtue of the fact that our results are 
slightly ahead--so that discrepancy that you sense is simply 
because you're ahead of the IEC official announcement there, so 
keep staying with us. 
  [Naidoo] Officials acting together with the party voting 
agents at a particular counting center. Where there is 
consensus with the regard to those ballot boxes that have not 
yet been reconciled then the counting can proceed with regard to 
those specific ballot boxes. Where there might be objections by 
any political party, then there is an objection form, prescribed 
form, where such objections will be noted. The important point 
to note is that these ballot boxes will be separated out and 
will be (?recorded) separately in the count. 
  The second question was: Does this mean we won't know if 
extra ballot boxes stuffed with ballots of unknown origins get 
slipped into the count? The answer to that is no. We will know 
because of the specialized voting station stamp for each voting 
station. The voting station number will be on the ballot paper 
statement which will be prepared by the presiding officer and 
will be checked with the ballots in that particular box. 
  Thirdly, does this mean we won't know if ballot boxes have 
been stolen, mislaid, or lost? The answer there is no, we will 
know, because the reconciliation of the ballot boxes itself is 
seen as part of the registration and receipt process of the 
ballot boxes, which you remember yesterday we said there was a 
first phase of the counting process, and that will still 
continue. The reconciliation process that the judge referred to 
last night, deals primarily with the reconciliation between the 
ballot paper statements per ballot box, and the contents of that 
box. 
  Fourth: Has any other election in the world being conducted 
without reconciliation? In the elections with a voter's role 
reconciliation processes are fairly standard. Countries with an 
established electoral system generally have voter's lists. 
However, with regard to countries without a voter's role, at 
this stage we are not able to confirm whether there are other 
similar precedents. We are consulting with our international 
commissioners for a speedy answer with regard to this query. 
  The next question: Where do all the unmarked ballot papers 
go now? They are secured at a safe place immediately after the 
count. The act provides for the commission to assess all the 
returned electoral materials and to destroy them after 30 days 
have passed after the count. This would include not only ballot 
papers but various other types of forms and other stationary 
that cannot be used again. 
  The next question is when will these unused ballot papers be 
counted? These will be done at the counting station and is part 
of the documentation that will be worked on by the counting 
centers' staff, after the vote itself is done. 
  And the question that leads on from that is: Will the IEC 
try to trace the so-called missing ballots? The answer to that 
is yes, and as you probably know already, the IEC has already 
instituted two investigations, an internal and an external one. 
  Okay, there were some additional questions which arrived a 
bit late, and I will just respond to them now: What is the 
difference between rejected votes and spoilt votes? My 
understanding is that there isn't a difference. So, It's just a 
issue of terminology. The next question I don't know how to 
answer? How did voting go in the hostels on the Rand? Was it 
peaceful or tense? I'm not sure whether you can actually have a 
peaceful election, and be tense at the same time. But 
indications are that there was no reports of violence, and that 
elections proceeded smoothly on the hostels generally. [passage

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Four major counting 
centres, controlling ballots which represent the largest slice 
of the election results, were running way behind schedule with 
counting by Sunday [1 May] evening. These facts emerged from 
internal Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reports received 
on the status of the counting process country-wide at 8PM on 
Sunday. 
  Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and Nasrec [National Exhibition 
Center] all reported massive backlogs while the North West, 
Western Cape and Northern Cape had almost completed their count. 
  By 8PM the OFS [Orange Free State] reported that more than 
half the votes in the province had been counted. 
  Information from some regions were sketchy on completed 
counts but most counting stations reported progress indicating 
that many tallies were ready to be verified and released by IEC 
HQ soon. 
  Difficulties seem to focus on Durban's counting, where the 
8PM report recorded that of its 60 stations 32 were not counting 
and at 28 there had been no reconciliation. A crisis team had 
been sent to deal with the problem. 
  At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed 
counting, 
50 were counting and two were still reconciling. 
  In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the 
bottleneck, expected to take counting into late Monday or even 
Tuesday, has occured at Pretoria and at Johannesburg's Nasrec 
Centre. Pretoria has reported zero per cent completed, with the 
counting stage just reached and the releases of counted batches 
only just starting. 
  At Nasrec the report recorded that counting officers were 
still unsure of procedure and monitors were assisting with the 
process. Randburg Bryanston, Sharonlea and Marlboror were all 
complete. 
  Vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand 
52 
per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent. 
All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Counting of ballot papers 
at the Durban Expo Centre will start on Sunday [1 May] 
afternoon, Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] KwaZulu/Natal 
Commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said. Speaking at Gallagher 
Estate, Midrand, Mr Moseneke said reconciliation at the Durban 
Expo Centre had been delayed because of a dispute over "pirate 
voting stations". 
  He said the dispute between the African National Congress 
and 
Inkatha Freedom Party was serious. Mr Moseneke said he did not 
want to comment further because it was a contested issue. 
  Earlier he said an IEC team was investigating several pirate 
polling station in KwaZulu/Natal. Initial reports had been 
submitted and would be considered by the commission in its 
assessment of whether the elections were free and fair. Ballot 
boxes received from these "pirate" stations would be counted 
separately. 
  Votes cast at such stations needed to be considered because 
"people who voted believed they were valid stations", he said. 
  Counting was going ahead at a rate of about 500,000 ballot 
papers an hour. The ideal target was a million an hour, Mr 
Moseneke said. Counting was delayed in many areas because of 
problems with the reconciliation process. Mr Moseneke said 
reconciliation had been difficult because inexperienced 
presiding officials had not filled out forms correctly in the 
rush of voting. 
  He said some ballot boxes delivered to the Nasrec 
[exhibition 
center] counting centre near Johannesburg had not been properly 
marked, but this did not amount to fraud. The ballot papers 
could still be checked because they bore specific voting station 
markings. 
  "I would have been suprised if it had gone smoothly at all 
voting stations," he said. He added: "South Africans deserves 
nothing less than to have all tallies placed before them in 
reasonable time." 
  By mid-afternoon on Sunday about 5.5 million ballot papers 
had been counted. Commenting on suggestions that Department of 
Home Affairs officials would have been better able to run the 
elections, Mr Moseneke said the commission's Electoral 
Administration Chief Director Piet Colyn was a home affairs 
official. Some home affairs officials were also in charge of 
warehousing ballot papers, he added. Several warehouse managers 
are being questioned in connection with missing ballot papers. 
Hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers have been found 
in two warehouses in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region. 
  IEC Adjudication Division head Mojanku Gumbi said the run-up 
to the elections had been free and fair. Only four of the 60 
cases before the adjudication division remained unresolved, he 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Greg Arde] </F>
  [Text] Durban May 1 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
was leading the election race in Natal on Sunday [1 May] evening 
but the rival African National Congress was optimistic that its 
support would reflect well when counting ended in the province, 
conservatively estimated to be late Monday. 
  IFP spokesman Peter Smith said his party was tentatively 
optimistic at 8 PM Sunday, when he said 20 percent of the Natal 
vote had been counted. On Sunday afternoon the IFP had at least 
60 percent support. 
  By 7 PM the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] said that 
while the IFP had only gained just under four percent of the 
national vote counted at that time, the party led in Natal. In 
KwaZulu/Natal the IFP had 81,459 votes (54.6 per cent) and ANC 
32,976 (22.1), the IEC said. 
  At 7 PM Sunday over 1,000 counting officials were queuing at 
Durban's Expo Centre in preparation for their 12-hour shift. A 
third of Natal's votes are expected to be counted there. 
  Earlier reconciliation of ballot boxes there was delayed 
because of a dispute over pirate voting stations, which were 
allegedly operated in Natal. The IEC said it was investigating 
the issue, and reports had been submitted for consideration by 
the commission in its assessment of whether the elections were 
free and fair. 
  By noon on Sunday the IEC said counting was on track at most 
stations in the province, but the results were only expected in 
36 hours -- if there were not any major hitches in the process. 
  Meanwhile, the ANC's election co-ordinator in southern 
Natal, 
Mr Nhlanhla Ngidi conceded that early indications did not give 
his party a good showing. "As of now we are not doing very 
well, the IFP lead is about 50 percent. But I think we are 
steadily going to rise. We expect a lot of votes in mainly 
urban areas and in southern Natal," he said. "Voting appears to 
have generally gone along racial lines and we are planning to 
get a majority among Africans," Mr Ngidi said, adding that the 
National Party and the IFP appeared to have won the support of 
minorities. But, he noted, only 100,000 votes had been counted 
in Natal, of an ANC estimated 4.5 to 6 million voters. 
  The IFP's Mr Smith said: "Until you start reaching a far 
higher percentage it's difficult to draw conclusions, but it 
looks like we're on a winning streak." He said the IFP would 
probably be "neck and neck" with the ANC in urban townships of 
Natal. 
  The IEC reports that counting in certain smaller rural 
stations in Natal like Babanango and Pongola was completed on 
Sunday. Counting at the bigger stations was on Sunday night 
still continuing at a steady rate. It's acknowledged that the 
outcome in these areas could dramatically affect the final Natal 
result.

  [Tect] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Election tallies from the 
crucial Nasrec [National Exhibition Center] counting centre from 
which the main PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] result 
is expected would probably not be completed until midnight on 
Monday [2 May], IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] 
Commissioner Helen Suzman, predicted on Sunday. She said the 
task was huge, had started under chaotic circumstances and now 
faced the problem that many counters were teachers who had to be 
back at school on Monday. 
  Permission would be sought, particularly from the DET 
[Department of Education and Training], for these teachers to 
continue counting. 
  Asked about the chances of the election being declared free 
and fair, she said she would like to quote Prime Minister John 
Vorster to say the alternative was too ghastly to contemplate. 
"But we have a useful adjective," she said. It was the word 
"substantially". "I don't know whether anybody knows what it 
really means but its a useful word."

  [Text] The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] commissioner, Mrs. Helen 
Suzman, says she never wants to hear the words up and running 
again for as long as she lives. Speaking at Gallagher's Estate 
in Midrand on the counting of ballots in the PWV region, she 
said she doubted whether the results would be out before 
midnight tonight. Mrs. Suzman said she'd visited the Nasrec 
[National Exhibition Center] Counting Center, and that dozens of 
ballot boxes had not even been opened yet. She jokingly 
referred to her job as commissioner as the most terrible job she 
had ever had. She said that although it was the smallest 
province, it was the most densely populated, and she'd only 
received the assignment three weeks before the election had 
started.

<F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>
  [Text] Bloemfontein May 1 SAPA -- With the African National 
Congress looking set for a major victory in the [Orange] Free 
State, the party's regional premiership candidate said it was 
clear many whites had disregarded colour and voted ANC. "The 
Orange Free State defied racial boundaries," said Patrick Terror 
Lekota said on Sunday [1 May] night. This, and some black 
support for formerly white parties, showed that voters in the 
Free State had made decisions based on issues and not race, he 
said. 
  This was not the view of NP [National Party] Free State 
leader Kobie Coetsee, who said he was disappointed that voters 
in SA's [South Africa's] first non-racial election had clearly 
cast votes according to "the notion of colour". 
  Latest provisional figures from the Independent Electoral 
Commission (IEC) on Sunday evening put the ANC well ahead with 
65.9 per cent of votes polled, with the NP on 13.4 per cent. 
The Democratic Party had 7.6 per cent and the Freedom Front 7.2 
per cent. However, unofficial figures obtained from reliable 
electoral sources, but not yet released by the IEC, indicated a 
landslide ANC victory with over 80 per cent of the vote. IEC 
officials said they expected a complete provisional result for 
the Free State by midday on Monday. 
  A senior NP Free State official said the NP was disappointed 
with its results and had expected to do better, especially in 
the northern Free State goldfields where it concentrated its 
campaign. 
  Reaction to the apparent ANC victory was muted in the 
Bloemfontein city centre and surrounding townships on Sunday, 
with residents appearing to go about their normal business. In 
Freedom Square squatter camp, Jackson Mahope, 25, was watching a 
soccer match Sunday afternoon and said he did not need to follow 
the election results too closely. "I know who won," he said with 
confidence. 
  Mr Lekota said many Free State whites had concentrated on 
party politics and found in the ANC a program that suited them. 
This would give the region a big advantage and should be 
encouraged. The image of the Free State as a peaceful and 
stable region should be maintained as the best way to empower 
its new leadership to attract investment that was frightened 
away from violence in Natal and the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. 
  Mr Lekota was upbeat about the region's potential for growth 
and said the ANC planned to urgently begin an intensive 
education programme and give immediate attention to housing. He 
urged ANC supporters to behave with discipline and calm and not 
to loot or cause chaos in townships and city centres when they 
celebrated the final poll results. "Lets celebrate and have 
champagne bottles popping, but we must respect the rights now 
enshrined in the interim constitution." He appealed to police 
to watch out for troublemakers and not to allow the situation to 
run out of control. 
  The poll results indicated that the Freedom Front [FF] had 
reasonable support in the Free State, Mr Lekota said, which 
meant the rightwing poll boycott had failed. The FF had not, 
however, got as much support as it thought it had and did not 
get enough votes for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland]. 
  The ANC was concerned that its opposition should make a 
reasonable showing in the election, Mr Lekota said, so a proper 
government of national unity could be formed. If not, he would 
suggest the new government should insist on close consultations 
with other parties when making decisions.

  [Text] De Aar April 30 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] officials in the IEC's control room at De Aar 
in the Northern Cape on Saturday [30 April] embarked on a sit-in 
strike because, they said, complaints about pay had not been 
addressed, a SAPA correspondent reports. They said they had 
unsuccessfully asked for service contracts and information on 
pay scales when employed two weeks ago. 
  After insisting on these late on Saturday afternoon, they 
were provided by the IEC regional office in Kimberley. But the 
pay offered was less than they had hoped for and the strike 
began. An official said the pay offered was less than that 
offered to officials in the main urban centres. 
  Telephone communications with the control room have been cut 
and striking officials are not responding to faxes. 
  IEC officials at Springbok and Upington are also 
dissatisfied 
about not receiving service contracts or information on pay 
scales. 
  Vote counting at De Aar was continuing on Saturday night, 
despite problems in the control room.

  [Text] East London April 30 SAPA -- The strike that 
paralysed vote counting in Transkei and other parts of the 
Eastern Cape is over. IEC spokesman Mike Chandler said from 
regional headquarters in East London that the strikers had 
received assurances from IEC head office in Midrand that their 
pay claims were receiving attention. He said cheques were being 
airfreighted to the Eastern Cape. 
  Counting in Transkei only started after midday Saturday [30 
April], when the strikers returned to work. 
  The strike had also been called off in the Queenstown 
sub-region and counting stations there were operational. 
  Chandler said there had been a late start to counting 
throughout the province. 
  Some areas had transport problems in getting ballot boxes to 
counting stations. Others had problems contacting IEC head 
office for the permission required before they could begin 
counting. 
  There had also been some problems in the reconciliation of 
ballot papers in Port Elizabeth, and counting started a "little 
later" there as well.

  [Text] East London May 2 SAPA -- Counting had not started 
in the Lady Frere District of Transkei by 10AM on Monday [2 
May], an Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman said. 
Matthew Moonieya said IEC officials and international observers 
had been sent from Umtata to the area to resolve a dispute over 
counting. 
  "We have a problem, but it's not a big problem," he said. He 
said the IEC had originally not authorised any counting stations 
in the district. Four were later established but owing to a 
failure in communications were not staffed. 
  Pan Africanist Congress officials were, however, insisting 
that the counting be done there and did not want the boxes moved. 
  An attempt late on Sunday to take the boxes to Queenstown to 
be counted was unsuccessful. 
  Mr Moonieya said he did not know how many votes were 
involved, but there had been 82 voting stations in the district.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth April 30 SAPA -- Thirty-one ballot 
boxes from KwaZakhele township in Port Elizabeth were isolated 
pending further examination by police on Saturday [30 April] on 
suspicion of electoral fraud. No finality on the charge of 
tampering has materialised. Both the police and the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] have urgently requested the 
attorney-general [AG] to travel from the judicial capital of 
Grahamstown to Port Elizabeth to make a ruling. 
  The ballots from these boxes will not be counted until the 
attorney-general reaches a decision, even though provisions for 
counting are contained in the Electoral Act. 
  Police liaison officer Col Chris Maritz claimed this week 
IEC 
officials had broken the seals off "several" ballot boxes and 
were scrutinising the ballots. 
  The IEC has repeatedly denied the allegation, though its 
officials have remained reluctant to comment until their own 
investigations were complete. A statement on the progress of the 
inquiry is expected to be released within the hour. 
  The National Party's [NP] premier candidate in the Eastern 
Cape, Dr Tertius Delport, formally requested the IEC on Saturday 
night to declare the ballots contained in the 31 boxes null and 
void. Dr Delport said the NP regarded the KwaZakhele votes as 
invalid. 
  African Christian Democratic Party regional elections head 
Ross Bradder said his party would abide by the AG's decision. 
  A declaration of the votes as null as void would not 
necessarily be in the interests of a free or fair election, 
however. "For the people who voted in good faith, their voice to 
the nation is being ignored in that case. 
  "It is unfortunate that this has occurred because we believe 
the election in the Eastern Cape has generally been run in a 
peaceful and correct way." 
  Ballots from a second Port Elizabeth suburb may be suspect, 
Mr Bradder announced later. 
  One ballot box from the Bethelsdorp area was separated from 
counting on saturday when officials at the central counting 
station noted it might have been resealed. 
  A discrepancy in serial numbers was spotted, said Mr 
Bradder. 
  IEC comment was not immediately available.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- The National Party [NP] 
on Sunday [1 May] lodged a formal complaint with the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] regarding allegations that IEC 
officials tampered with ballot boxes at the KwaZakhele voting 
station in the Eastern Cape earlier this week. IEC spokesman 
Humphrey Khoza made the announcement at a media briefing at 
Gallagher Estate on Sunday night. The matter was being 
investigated by police and the IEC, he said. 
  IEC northern [Orange] Free State Regional Commissioner Rosil 
Jager told reporters that results from only 10 counting stations 
were outstanding and she was confident counting in the region 
would be completed on sunday night. 
  Ms Jager said the commission was investigating several 
complaints lodged with it, and a team of 100 attorneys had been 
appointed to investigate alleged irregularities. Efforts would 
also be made to determine to what extent irregularities would 
influence the overall result in that region. 
  It was also announced at the news conference that a ballot 
box containing 1,000 ballot papers was found at the 
Steytlerville Police Station in the Eastern Cape. 
  Mr Khoza said the box would be counted separately.

  [Text] A further 24 ballot boxes from Port Elizabeth's 
black areas are under dispute after allegations by NP [National 
Party] and DP [Democratic Party] officials that the ballot 
papers in the boxes appear to have been neatly stacked. This 
brings the total number of ballot boxes under dispute at the 
Port Elizabeth District Counting Center to 60. The number of 
ballot papers in question is about 100,000.

<F P=106> [News conference by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa at </F>
ANC headquarters in Johannesburg -- live; transmitted in 
progress] 
  [Text] [Ramaphosa]...good in our country. The election has 
had the effect of bonding our people together and healing the 
wounds of the past, and making sure that South Africans emerge 
out of an apartheid past into a democratic future with a great 
deal of confidence. 
  The election itself has been a dynamo and an impetus with 
regard to the task of nation building and reconciliation. We 
believe that we have achieved a great deal out of this election. 
A new mood is beginning to spread throughout our country. Our 
people as a whole are beginning to feel postive after the 
election. The levels of violence have been reduced very 
drastically, there is a new confidence in the business community 
in our country, and we also believe that a new confidence has 
been infused into the future of our country and all our people 
are looking forward to the installation of a new government with 
a great deal of confidence. 
  The political tension between and among political parties 
has 
been reduced quite a lot, in spite of the fact that we are going 
to be challenging each other regarding the election campaign. 
The election itself has brought about a very positive and 
constructive approach with regard to resolving the problems 
which beset our country. Despite all the problems that were 
experienced during the election campaign, we believe that the 
election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we 
would like to applaud the Independent Electoral Commission which 
was charged with a mission impossible when it was appointed. It 
was just impossible for any structure in our country to be able 
to run the election in a very outstanding and successful way. 
But we believe that what the IEC has achieved is outstanding 
and we believe they should be applauded. We also want to voice 
pour appreciation to the media in the way they have approached 
the whole election process, in the way they have analyzed the 
difficulties and interpreted them. They have actually also 
infused a lot of confidence amongst our people, to encourage our 
people to believe and to know that the election has been 
successful. 
  There are problems that are being experienced in this point 
in time with regard to counting. Only a few counting stations 
have actually begun the counting process, but we believe that 
the IEC is going to execute its tasks properly in the end. And 
we call upon all our people to be patient with the IEC, to be 
patient with the counters as they are resolving their problem. 
And I would like to call on all of us to encourage them in the 
difficult task that now lies ahead. The counting process is an 
important task, an important aspect of the election process on 
the whole, and they now have a very difficult task, and we need 
to exercise patience, we need to have understanding, and we also 
need to know that they were charged with a virtually impossible 
task. But we have confidence that they are going to finalize 
the task that they were given despite all the problems that they 
are going through. Some results, we are made to believe have 
already come through, particularly in the [Orange] Free State, 
and they already indicate that the ANC is poised to achieve an 
overwhelming victory. We want to wait for the total results to 
come out before the ANC finally pronounces its attitude on these 
results. We have confidence that results will start coming 
through throughout the country later this afternoon, and we call 
on everybody to have the understanding that is required in this 
difficult situation, even if there is a delay, later into the 
night or even tomorrow. 
  Yesterday we had a discussion with the IEC, and they 
appraised us of some of the difficulties that they were bound to 
experience, and we had a great deal of understanding and 
appreciation, and we encourage them to move with some urgency to 
resolve some of the difficulties that they have, but we have no 
doubt whatsoever that they are the type who will at the end 
execute those functions to deliver a result which will finally 
confirm that indeed the elections were free and fair, and we 
call upon all our people to look forward to the final result 
being announced so that all of us, as South Africans, can 
welcome and usher in a new dispensation which will be free of 
oppression, free of apartheid, free of racial hatred.

<F P=106> [News conference by ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan at the ANC </F>
press center at the Carlton Center in Johannesburg -- live; at 
1635 GMT TV 1 coverage is interrupted and broadcasting of the 
conference continues on SABC CCV Television] 
  [Text] [Correspondent Estelle Pienaar] The ANC press 
briefing is about to get under way. It will be addressed by Dr. 
Pallo Jordan, assisting him is Carl Niehaus and also Marcel 
Golding. Over to you, Pallo. 
  [Jordan] We are going into a very big ANC victory, and 
though 
there are at this point very limited figures available, based on 
those figures we are projecting a majority of about 58 percent 
for the ANC. We expect that we will be able to see that 
reflected during the course of tonight in the figures produced 
by the SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation]. We are 
also expecting possible gains in Natal, the [Orange] Free State, 
the Eastern Cape, and the Western Cape which could result in 
that 58 percent figure, perhaps to 60 percent or more. 
  At this point we are still very confident that the current 
ANC lead in the Northern Cape will hold, and based on our 
returns, which are running slightly ahead of those that are made 
available by the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], we 
think that lead is going to be maintained. We are particularly 
pleased about the strong showing of the Colored vote for the 
ANC, and we think this is in part due to the fact that in the 
Northern Cape Colored voters were evenly split in their support 
between the NP [National Party] and the ANC, in sharp contrasts 
to the trends that we have noted in the Western Cape. This is 
particularly true for Colored voters in the rural areas where 
our figures indicate that 4.5 percent rural vote went to the ANC 
and against 55 percent of the NP. 
  The same was true of the urban areas such as Kimberley, and 
we think that this reflects a change in the rest of the country 
which differs very sharply from what occurred in the Western 
Cape. We see the same trend also in Uitenhage, in Eastern Cape, 
and other areas. 
  At this point in time the figures for the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] are exceedingly low because the 
counting started so late. At this moment in time we are showing 
a majority in excess of 64 percent, but we think that 60 percent 
is closer to the actual showing we'll make. So one can expect 
that 64 percent that we're seeing at present in the PWV might 
well drop to around 60 percent. There are African rural areas, 
many of whom were unfamiliar with the ANC at the beginning of 
this campaign, and where we have struggled very hard to 
familiarize people with the ANC and also to familiarize people 
even with the symbol of the ANC and its slogans, showing a 
particularly strong and high level of support for the ANC. In 
areas such as the Northern Transvaal it runs as high as 98 
percent among Africans in the rural areas. In the Eastern 
Transvaal as high as 91 percent, and in the North West as high 
as about 97 percent. 
  We think that this is extraordinary consolidation of the 
support of the ANC in the rural areas in particular. The other 
trend that we have noted in the election is that the Democratic 
Party [DP] campaign does not seem to have paid out. We read 
this in part as owing to the DP's concentration on an anti-ANC 
campaign which has resulted in may white voters voting for the 
NP at the expense of the DP. The DP in fact on current showing, 
and we admit that these are early days, and most of the huge 
urban areas have not yet reported back, but that showing at 
present, it looks like the DP is going to fall into something 
like forty, and will be replaced by the Freedom Front as the 
second largest party among white voters. 
  The other trend which we have noted is that the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] doesn't seem to be faring as well as 
many had expected. There doesn't seem to be any identifiable 
area of the country where the PAC has been able to show visible 
support. This is true of areas where people expected it to make 
a good showing such as the Transkei, the Northern Transvaal and 
Eastern Cape. Early polling has showed that there are some gains 
we are going to make in various parts of the Cape including the 
Western Cape. We expect that by the time counting?closes in the 
Western Cape you will note that the ANC total will increase by 
about 4 or 5 points from the 24 percent that we're showing at 
present. We will now attend to questions, thank you. 
  [Correspondent Callie Long] Dr. Jordan, four warrants have 
been issued in connection with ballot papers that were destined 
for the East Rand and Soweto. Do you regard this in a serious 
light? Is it going to affect the outcome? 
  [Jordan] At this point in time one would not like to 
speculate about that particular disclosure. We did mention a 
few days ago that there were indications that there was mischief 
afoot in this election, and we pointed specifically to the 
non-arrivals of ballot papers especially in areas like the East 
Rand and Soweto. We would like that very much in the hands of 
the IEC to investigate, and we will defer (? some day). We 
wouldn't like to speculate about the significance of that at 
this point in time. 
  [Correspondent Sefakunyaka] Dr. Jordan, it is quite clear 
that the National party and the African National Congress are 
guaranteed a place in Parliament. Would you be prepared to 
engage in the lottery of crystal ball gazing and tell us which 
other parties you think might also come in, and how will this 
affect a government of national unity? 
  [Jordan] The ANC commitment to establishing a government of 
national unity remains unchanged and we will honor the terms of 
the interim constitution that any party that gains 5 percent of 
the ballot in the elections is entitled to sit in the government 
of national unity. At this point in time the parties that 
nationally will feature it would appear are the NP and the 
Freedom Front perhaps. One is uncertain of what status the DP 
will have at the end of counting, but as I say, we have not had 
returns from the huge urban areas as yet, which might of course 
change the picture very dramatically with respect to the DP. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The PAC has virtually 
disappeared from the political scene. Do you attach any 
specific importance to that and what have you got for the 
policies of the future? 
  [Jordan] Well, I would say that it is premature to make a 
judgment about the significance of that. It is just something 
that one is noting, because there had been high expectations of 
the PAC's performance in certain parts of the country. I 
wouldn't like to speculate about its significance at this point 
in time. 
  [Correspondent Angie Caplianos] What is your reaction to the 
slow flow of results coming in? 
  [Jordan] The slow flow of results, I suppose, is as a result 
of some of the problems that the IEC has encountered. We are 
aware, for example, that in an urban area such as Durban, 
counting only started this morning. In the PWV, there seem to 
have been a lot of teetthing problems all of yesterday and 
counting started very late. In other urban areas, there were 
instances of sit-down strike and go-slow by counters and that, 
of course, has also [word indistinct] very negatively on the 
rate at which we are receiving the returns. When we started 
this conference, I don't think they had even reached the 20 
percent mark yet, in terms of the votes that had been counted. 
It means that the nail-biting will continue longer, but I don't 
think we can help it. 
  [Correspondent] Mac Maharaj was quoted today as saying that 
even if some parties didn't get 5 percent, they may be invited 
to join in a government of national unity to increase stability 
in the country. Is that an ANC position? 
  [Jordan] Now, the ANC has always been very insistent that we 
want to make government as inclusive as possible and we want to 
enhance stability and I am sure that that is the viewpoint which 
could be looked at. Mac Maharaj at that point probably was 
expressing a personal opinion, but it is one personal opinion 
that runs counter to the thrust of ANC policy. 
  [Correspondent] It looks like the Freedom Front was able to 
get a lot of support from the Afrikaner community. Now, you made 
a commitment that if the Freedom Front got substantial support, 
you would look again at the issue of a volkstaat [Afrikaner 
homeland]. Are you still looking at that? Secondly, does that 
change the attitude toward the Afrikaner community in a sense 
that now there is a substantial support for a party which 
actually does not want to be run or does not accept your 
governnment, in a sense that they want to have their own 
volkstaat. 
  [Jordan] No, our attitude to the Afrikaner community remains 
unchanged. Afrikaners, like all other South Africans, are part 
of this country. They have a home in this country and, in the 
view of the ANC, they will always have a place in South Africa. 
As to the issue of a volkstaat, our commitment to discuss the 
issue of a volkstaat also remains unchanged. We have not said 
that we will ever entertain the notion of a volkstaat. What we 
have said is that we are prepared to discuss the idea of a 
volkstaat with those who support it, with a view to ensuring 
that those who want a volkstaat, and want to pursue a volkstaat 
do not engage in unconstitutional activities or in armed 
activity to attain their objectives. It doesn't mean that we 
will ever embrace the notion of a volkstaat ourselves. 
  [Correspondent] I think one of the areas which is concerning 
a lot of people is Natal. There have been reports of a number 
of areas where ANC party officials were picked up, and I wonder 
what happened. How many objections have actually really been 
registered by the ANC? 
  [Jordan] The issues you raised have been placed before the 
IEC and we have submitted quite a number of complaints with 
respect to that with the IEC. In addition to that, we have also 
placed a number of protests and brought to the notice of the IEC 
other irregularities which you have not mentioned. We are aware 
for example that there were a number of pirate voting stations 
in various points of Natal. We've brought those to the notice 
of the IEC. We've brought to the notice of the IEC other 
irregularities, but we are leaving those matters very much in 
the hands of the IEC because that is the machinery that was set 
in place to deal with them. 
  [Correspondent] You seem to be conceding that you have no 
chance of reaching 67 percent. I know you are worried that the 
National Party will have a stranglehold on constitutional 
changes in the future. 
  [Jordan] We are not conceding that we will not reach 67 
percent. Every party goes into an election with a view to 
winning as large a majority as it can win. It's like going into 
a cricket match and saying, oh well, if you reach a century you 
we will be content. You don't go in like that. You go in there 
to knock the socks off the other team. If you make 2,000, good 
luck to you. If your entire team comes out scoring ducks, too 
bad; I mean, that's the way the game is played. 
  [Correspondent Gregory Katz] How would you explain the 
party's relative lack of support in the Western Cape among the 
coloreds? 
  [Jordan] I'm sure there are a whole number of reasons why we 
were not able to win as much support in the colored community as 
we had hoped for. One of those reasons I'm sure is a long past 
during which the Western Cape, during the days of apartheid, was 
regarded as the colored preference area which produced 
competition for jobs, for scarce resources between African and 
colored communities. I'm sure that is one explanation. But 
certainly there are others as well. 
  [Correspondent] There is a very good showing of the Inkatha 
party in KwaZulu/Natal. Is there a possibility that there will 
be a national position for Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi (word 
indistinct) the ANC's position? 
  [Jordan] The positions in the government of national unity 
will not be determined by your performance in any particular 
province. They will be determined by your performance in the 
country as a whole. But as I said, the crux of ANC policy is 
inclusivity; so we would not exclude the idea of the IFP being 
part of a government of national unity even if the performance 
does not measure up to the constitutional requirements. 
  [Correspondent] A similar question with respect to the 
Freedom Front. They've made a reasonably -- at this point 
anyway. [sentence as heard] Is there any likelihood that they 
will be in a government of national unity? Related to that, how 
does the ANC and its government expect to ensure minority rights? 
  [Jordan] To deal with the latter part of the question first, 
we have never thought in terms of minority rights. We have 
always thought in terms of individual rights. We've always said 
that a constitution that guarantees the right of every South 
African citizen, ipso facto protects the right of collectivity 
of South African citizens, whether they are a majority or a 
minority within the population. Secondly, the first part of 
your question. It will be up to the Freedom Front, if it makes 
that five percent ceiling threshold, whether or not it wants to 
participate in the government of national unity. There is no 
requirement that a party that scores that 5 percent threshold 
should participate in the government. What the constitution 
says is that it is eligible to participate. It's up to the 
party whether it wants to exercise that option or not. So that 
will be something you will have to put to the Freedom Front, 
whether it wants to participate in a government of national 
unity if it makes that 5 percent threshold. 
  [Correspondent] Will it be advised to do so by the ANC 
government? 
  [Jordan] The constitution requires us to do so even if we 
didn't want to do so, but we will invite it nonetheless. 
  [Correspondent] Just to follow up on the question about what 
looks like the ANC did not achieve a two-thirds majority. Are 
you disappointed in that result and what impact will this have 
on the constitution-building and nation-building process down 
the road? 
  [Jordan] Like I said, you go into a match to score the 
highest score. So you are not going to be happy if you don't 
score as highly as you would have liked to. It almost stands to 
reason -- we would have been happier to make a two-thirds. Now 
what impact that will have on the constitution-making process, I 
don't think is of great significance because we had always 
indicated quite clearly that whether or not we made a two-thirds 
majority, we were not going to try to use that majority to 
impose a constitution on the rest of the country. Even if we 
had made a two-thirds or a three-quarters majority, we would 
have striven to be as inclusive as possible. So that does not 
change the manner in which we are going to behave in the 
constitution-making body. 
  [Correspondent Brandon Templeton] Taking into consideration 
the allegations of pirate voting stations and unavailability of 
IFP stickers in KwaZulu/Natal -- does this mean that the ANC and 
the IFP have come to some sort of agreement in the case of some 
areas being...? [changes thought] Will it be possible to tell 
whether a fair and free election was held in certain areas? 
  [Jordan] As I indicated, irregularities that have occurred, 
that have come to our notice we have placed before the IEC. 
It's the IEC's responsibility to deal with those 
irregularities. We are not in the habit of making behind the 
scenes deals with anyone about irregularities. [break in 
transmission; news conference continues on CCV TV] 
  That was true not only in Natal, but true in many parts of 
the country, especially on the first and second day of polling. 
So, that is something specific to the Natal Province. It is a 
problem, which I think is going to have to be resolved by the 
political parties, together with the IEC. The issue of 
reconciliation, I would think again, is something that has to be 
resolved by the political parties, together with IEC. 
  [Correspondent] If we may return to the Western Cape for a 
moment. By your own estimation at the end of the day, the ANC 
may not get any more than 38 percent of the vote there. Can you 
just give us a peep in the long term as to what ANC's policy 
will be to, or strategy will be, to bring in more of the 
so-called colored vote into the fold of the ANC? 
  [Jordan] The ANC will do what it has always done in the 
past. 
We fought this campaign on the issue of basic needs of South 
African people. Well, we will continue to do that -- to place 
the issues before the South African public. 
  [Correspondent Michael Havlett] A slightly technical 
question: At what stage would you expect to make a claim that 
you have won this election and that the ANC will be taking part? 
[sentence as heard] 
  [Jordan, laughing] I wish I knew. I think you are all aware 
that just last night we've been boogying on the second floor of 
this hotel, because we anticipated that we would be able to make 
that claim sometimes during the course of last night. Well, you 
were disappointed. Everyone was disappointed. We are going to 
boogie again tonight, but with far less expectation that we will 
be able to make the claim tonight, but, you know, we will boogie 
nonetheless, because we think it is about time we did. No, 
really, I can't answer that question. 
  [Correspondent] Isn't there a point at which, you know, that 
number of votes which you have got, which will guarantee you 201 
seats in the assembly, or something of that sort? [sentence as 
heard] 
  [Jordan] I suppose when we reach that point, we will be able 
to do that, but when that will be, your guess is as good as mine 
at this point. 
  [Correspondent] But that sets the trigger? 
  [Jordan] Something like that. Something like that. 
  [Correspondent] The ANC has emphasized non-racialism in its 
policies. How bothersome is it that the vote broke down so much 
along ethnic lines? 
  [Jordan] No, those have not broken down along ethnic lines. 
There are certain parts of the country where that might be true, 
but it's not the National Party, and we think that's very 
significant. Even Northern Cape, for example -- most experts 
anticipated that the ANC would not be able to win the Northern 
Cape because of the large colored community there. Well, the 
reverse has proved to be true. 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider the election as being free 
and fair? 
  [Jordan] We would say on the whole free and fair, on the 
whole free and fair. 
  [Correspondent] Would you give us some indication of what 
Mr. 
Mandela was doing today while he was watching the results? 
  [Jordan] He will come and boogie later when the results are 
more firmly established. I don't think it will be proper to 
talk about what the president is doing in private. [laughter] 
He had some press engagements today.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC leader Nelson Mandela by correspondent </F>
David Dimbleby in Johannesburg on 1 May; from "The New South 
Africa" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Dimbleby] Did you have to 
pinch yourself to believe that the sight of millions of black 
people voting was actually true, was actually happening? 
  [Mandela] Well, I did not actually have to pinch myself, but 
perhaps I did the same thing, because when I saw those lines of 
people ready to vote, my emotions were stirred and I thought 
that we are going through an unforgettable moment. 
  [Dimbleby] Something you thought you would never see? 
  [Mandela] Well, I have never really lost hope that this day 
would come, but I must immediately qualify that because there 
were periods when the enemy, as we called them at the time, 
appeared to be on top and appeared to have crushed the 
resistance, but those were few and far between. Throughout, our 
morale was very high and we felt imprisoned, but one day we 
would return and the people would be victorious. In that 
regard, the international community played a tremendous role, 
because we felt throughout that the enemy was completely 
isolated, we had the support of the entire world, and in that 
situation, whatever problem you had, ultimately you would win in 
the end. 
  [Dimbleby] Now you are a keep-fit fanatic, you do your 
morning press-ups, do you expect to be leading the ANC in five 
years time, into the next election? 
  [Mandela] Oh yes, on one condition, on condition that my 
people want me to lead. 
  [Dimbleby] Because most people in this country think that 
you 
are the only person that can guarantee continued peaceful 
transition, don't they? 
  [Mandela] Well that is a very flattering opinion, but I must 
say that we have a gifted, committed leadership that would like 
to serve the people of South Africa as a whole, not just the 
members of the ANC, and the leaders themselves will come and go 
but the organization is committed to a specific policy that we 
have worked out and published, and on the basis of which we will 
come into power. 
  [Dimbleby] Of course you have dropped, during the course of 
making that policy, many of our more radical proposals that 
cannot have particularly pleased the communists and the trade 
unionists in the ANC. If this plan begins to falter, does not 
quite work, do you expect the ANC to revert to radicalism? 
  [Mandela] I do not have any pessimism in my heart. I am 
influenced by optimistic ideas as to our future. It is not 
correct that you would think there was any difference of opinion 
between the members of the South African Communist Party and 
COSATU [Confederation of South African Trade Unions] in regard 
to the program that we have worked out. 
  [Dimbleby] At the moment? 
  [Mandela] At the moment. 
  [Dimbleby] But things can change. 
  [Mandela] Well, things can always change and we cannot 
predict the future. The point is, at the present moment we are 
unanimous as to the priorities that have to be attended to. All 
of us, the ANC, the South African Communist Party, COSATU, are 
committed to this policy. 
  [Dimbleby] Chris Hani always said that the great danger when 
the ANC came into power was that it would lose touch with its 
grass roots. How are you going to stop your party becoming 
fat-cats? 
  [Mandela] Well, first, this program, the reconstruction and 
development program, was developed together with the masses of 
people in people's forums. That is a very effective method of 
exercising democracy where it is the masses of the people that 
are telling the leaders what should be done, instead of the 
leaders telling the people what should be done. 
  [Dimbleby] So you think the poor people in South Africa, the 
poor blacks who just voted for you were in favor of the 
concessions you have made to the bankers and the businessmen in 
the course of these negotiations? 
  [Mandela] All that the people are interested in is: Will we 
have jobs tomorrow; will we have hopes; will there be free, 
universal, compulsory education; will we have hospitals and 
clinics; will we have electricity in our homes, running water; 
will we have paved streets; that is all they are interested in. 
  [Dimbleby] And if they do not get that they will turn away 
from you. 
  [Mandela] If they do not get that they will be entitled to 
throw out the ANC government. I will be with them in that. If 
they feel the ANC has failed to deliver the goods, I will be at 
the head of a march to overthrow the ANC government. We are 
there to carry out a specific mandate. What is going to happen 
when the results of the elections have been made is to ensure 
that the masses of the people -- contrary to the legacy of the 
past -- are involved as to how to address their basic needs, 
what the first steps to be taken in each particular region and 
in this particular locality are to address these problems. 
  [Dimbleby] Is it a greater fear for you that the mass of 
the people, as you put it, the mass of black people become 
disaffected with the ANC, or that whites start to leave this 
country because of the measures that you take? 
  [Mandela] No, this plan that we have published, that we have 
drafted five times, has been widely circulated among a wide 
range of opinion makers, including business, academic, state 
corporations, state departments, a wide variety of 
organizations, and the five drafts that we have contained the 
(commitments), and therefore there is no reason for any 
particular population group in this country to leave the country 
because of this program, because working up front in placing it 
before the country and accommodating the fears and concerns of 
all communities. We have had a meeting with Oppenheimer and his 
colleagues to discuss this document, they have made certain 
suggestions, we are planning another meeting next week. We have 
been up front in insuring that that plan should receive the 
support of everybody who is going to be important in bringing 
about economic stability in this country, generate wealth and 
insure that there are job opportunities, job creation in this 
country. 
  [Dimbleby] Of course whites might leave if they felt life 
was 
too violent here -- as it was up until the last few days. Do 
you believe the third force that you often talked about 
allegedly exists, do you believe that is still a threat? 
  [Mandela] Oh yes, it is, and in fact a democratic government 
that is able to say to the security forces, the crimes you have 
committed before 8 October 1990, provided you make a full 
disclosure within a specified time, say four to six months, we 
will be able to pardon you, to give you an indemnity. If you 
continue to say that those who have committed offenses between 8 
October 1990 to December 1993, their case is at the discretion 
of the new government, of the new parliament, we will examine it 
on merit. 
  [Dimbleby] But will your first action be a clamp down on the 
right-wingers who have been bombing and the people who you think 
still threaten security in this country? 
  [Mandela] I do not think that that is an important matter. 
The police are quite sufficient to deal with the right-wing. 
They are a tiny minority and I do not think we should exonerate 
them. To clamp down on them, to bend them, is to give them an 
importance that they do not deserve. Well, look at the way the 
police have dealt with the bombers -- they put an end to it. It 
might still occur but they have nipped it in the bud and I think 
we should congratulate the South African police for having done 
such an excellent job. 
  [Dimbleby] How would you judge your success, or failure 12 
months from now? 
  [Mandela] Well, my success or failure will first be judged 
on 
the basis of whether we have carried out the reconstruction and 
development program and have started to meet the basic needs of 
the people. Second, it will be judged on the basis of whether 
we have been able to remove the concerns and the fears of the 
minority groups, especially the whites. It will be judged on 
the basis of whether we have made progress in creating this 
environment of national reconciliation and nationhood, of 
bringing about peace in our country, whether we have been able 
to involve the religious groups who are concerned with the 
maintenance of high moral standards, whether we are able to show 
that they have an unimpeded government in order to insure that 
corruption, covert operations are eliminated and that these high 
moral standards are maintained in government. 
  [Dimbleby] Mr. Mandela, thank you very much. [passage

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] As it has been repeated often enough, but now it 
looks like becoming a reality, Nelson Mandela can only be a few 
hours away from being elected president of the new Republic of 
South Africa. Our southern African correspondent Fergal Keane 
talked to Mr. Mandela earlier today in Johannesburg and asked 
him first for his reaction to the initial [election] results. 
  [Begin recording] [Mandela] They are encouraging, because 
they reflect the feelings, the hopes, and aspirations of our 
people. I think the best way of looking at the results is not to 
do so from the point of view of which party is winning and which 
is losing. We must look at them from the point of view that, 
for the first time in the history of the country, the people of 
South Africa, have had the opportunity to exercise the most 
important right of a citizen. That is the approach, and I think 
if one looks at it from that angle, we will all be excited by 
the results. 
  [Keane] Nevertheless, it looks like the ANC will have a 
comfortable majority. You will be the president, while your own 
supporters will be pleased by that. There are frightened 
minorities out there, particularly white people, who fear that 
they may be marginalized or punished by an ANC government. What 
do you say today to reassure those people? 
  [Mandela] If one looks at our record, he will find that 
there 
is no real basis for those fears and concerns, because we have a 
long record, stretching over years, over decades, of nation- 
building, of promoting the spirit of reconciliation, and that 
has become even more clearer since I was released from jail. 
Therefore, we are concerned with the fears of the minority. If 
one looks at our record, he will find that there is no basis for 
those fears, although we acknowledge that they are genuine? 
  [Keane] But you would say to whites that South Africa is a 
home for them in the future? 
  [Mandela] We have said that repeatedly in the meetings that 
we have addressed in the run-up to these elections [words 
indistinct] our basic priority on which we are not compromising 
is to address the basic needs of the masses of the people. To 
be specific: the creation of jobs; [words indistinct] provision 
of a free, compulsory, universal quality education; the 
introduction of electricity, running water, flush toilets, paved 
roads, those are our basic priorities and we cannot compromise 
on that. But at the same time, we are keen not to lower the 
standards of the minorities in this country, in particular the 
whites. 
  [Keane] Now, this election has been a terrible emotional 
time 
for many people, particularly the black majority. Your own 
parents grew up and died without ever having the vote. What do 
you think they would feel now if they saw their son on the verge 
of becoming president? 
  [Mandela] They would feel very excited as much as we do that 
our people at last, after many sacrifices, during which many 
people have paid with their own lives. Nevertheless, we are now 
there, we have realized our dreams and aspirations. 
  [Keane] My final question to you. Following you around the 
country for the past four years since your release from prison, 
I have heard you say again and again to large crowds of people: 
I love each and every one of you and you said you want to put 
them in the pocket of your shirt so that you can look at them 
every day. Just tell me something about that, about the love you 
feel for the people in this land? 
  [Mandela] Before I went to jail, during my life in jail, and 
afterward, I have come across great South Africans from all 
population groups -- Africans, Coloreds, Indians, Afrikaners, 
English-speaking South Africans, who love their country and 
their people. What I am saying, I am expressing something which 
is in the hearts of every South African. That is one of the 
things that has encouraged all of us about the future of our 
country. We have got a wonderful country. We have got a bright 
future. [end recording]

  [Text] The ANC leader, Nelson Mandela, has pledged to back 
a tax system favorable to investment in South Africa, saying he 
won't seize privately owned land for redistribution. Mr. 
Mandela said the country needed massive resources, including 
foreign capital, to rebuild the economy. He said he expected 
foreign capital, much of it from the United States, to play a 
vital if not decisive role in helping to rebuild the South 
African economy. 
  The ANC leader added that he believed the four days of 
voting 
last week had been free and fair, despite some problems that he 
said would not affect the outcome.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Manne Dipico, ANC Northern Cape </F>
premier candidate, by unidentified SABC announcer on the 
"Elections '94" program--live] 
  [Announcer] Hello, Manne. Can you hear me? 
  [Dipico] I can hear you. 
  [Announcer] How are you? 
  [Dipico] OK. I'm fine. 
  [Announcer] How are things going that side? 
  [Dipico] Things are pretty calm. Eerybody is out in the 
street. They have not got the...[pauses] They are looking first 
at the TVs, and they are looking to the radios, they are 
awaiting the final results. No one wants to jump out and open 
the champagne bottles before the final results are announced. 
So, I can tell you there is excitement in the air, but no one 
wants to open it up. 
  [Announcer] But what is the feeling of your party at the 
moment? 
  [Dipico] The feeling of our party is that we feel extremely 
honored. Our people, to go out in their thousands to vote, and 
endured hardships, and exercised patience from the 26th to the 
28th, and standing in long rows of queues for hours to cast 
their votes for the first time. And we thank them very much. 
They have shown tolerance, they have shown that they are 
prepared to work together to be able to achieve a very stable 
province, and to be able to deal with issues which are going to 
affect their daily lives, in particular their basic needs, which 
are of importance, particularly in our province because it is 
really not developed. 
  [Announcer] Manne, the fight here is for the colored vote. 
Do you think your party has done enough? 
  [Dipico] The results actually put it very clear to you that 
the majority of our voters in the Province of the Northern Cape 
are coloreds, which clearly put a point and a message across 
that our people will never be fooled by all those who have been 
going around that the colored community vote NP [National 
Party], or the colored does not trust the ANC. It is a clear 
message that our people know who are the right leaders. They 
know which are the organizations which they can trust their 
lives on. And the message of the results of the Northern Cape 
clearly demonstrates that our people, even in the colored 
community, wanted a change, and a change for a better future, 
and the ANC can provide that. They have put their confidence in 
the hands of the ANC, in the hands of the leadership, which is 
tested and proven from Mandela up to the provincial leadership. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much. 
  [Dipico] Thank you very much.

Mr. Patrick Lekota, says the ANC victory in the province should 
be seen as a victory for everybody. Speaking in Bloemfontein, 
Mr. Lekota said that he would not be surprised if the result 
surpasses all surveys and predictions. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Richard Newton] At a press 
conference in Bloemfontein, Mr. Lekota said that although his 
opponents had not done that well, they would still be involved 
in decision-making. 
  [Lekota] I will consult with my colleagues, and I would like 
to suggest to them that we should insist on close consultation 
in whatever we do with the parties that exist in this region. 
  [Newton] Mr. Lekota added that support for his party had 
come 
from across the spectrum. 
  [Lekota] Many white Free Staters voted without regard to 
color, and voted therefore for the African National Congress. 
  [Newton] In anticipation of the expected celebrations, Mr. 
Lekota appealed to supporters not to misbehave. 
  [Lekota] I want to urge our members and supporters, and 
well- 
wishers to behave with utmost discipline and comeliness. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claassen] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- If voting trends continue 
to remove minor parties from the political race African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela may choose to bring some of 
the parties' leaders into a government of national unity. 
  This was the view of senior ANC executive Mac Maharaj who 
said on Sunday [1 May] the movement's concern in heading the 
next government was stability. "Mr Mandela will reach out to 
these minority parties and bring them into government," he 
predicted. 
  The one condition would be that they were parties of 
"substance", he said, "not like the Federal Party or KISS [Keep 
It Straight and Simple Party]". 
  "For instance (Freedom Front leader) Constand Viljoen; he 
may 
only get four per cent. The law requires five per cent (to get 
a cabinet post) but he will be brought in for the sake of 
stability." 
  Other parties which may fail to make the cut-off, such as 
the 
Democratic Party, are certain to meet the requirement of 
"substance". 
  It is also certain that any such inclusions would not be 
agreed to by what is emerging as the ANC's only real opposition, 
State President F. W. de Klerk's National Party [NP] which 
appears to be exceeding intitial expectations by a large margin. 
  The NP is nevertheless not likely to exceed the one-third 
mark by much and will jealously keep whatever cabinet posts it 
is entitled to. Any "gift" cabinet posts for smaller parties 
will have to be at the cost of the ANC.

  [Text] Pretoria May 1 SAPA -- The leader of the National 
Party [NP], State President F. W. de Klerk, on Sunday [1 May] 
evening said he was optimistic the NP would do better than had 
been indicated by the polls so far. At an impromptu press 
conference outside the NP federal offices in Pretoria, President 
de Klerk told reporters it was clear at this stage there would 
be two parties to qualify for deputy presidencies -- the NP and 
the African National Congress. 
  But, said Mr de Klerk, there had been many complaints about 
irregularities and according to the NP these had been 
widespread. This was a matter of great concern and would be 
taken up with the Independent Electoral Commission and the 
various political parties, Mr de Klerk said. "I'm as anxious 
and frustrated as the public to see things come to a 
conclusion," he added.

  [Text] Pretoria May 2 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk and 
senior National Party [NP] members were meeting on Monday [2 
May] to compile a shortlist of NP members to serve in the new 
cabinet. Cabinet members, the four NP provincial leaders and 
provincial premiership candidates were at the meeting, NP 
spokesman Danie du Plessis said. 
  The meeting will also discuss NP representation in 
provincial 
governments. 
  On Tuesday, Mr de Klerk will meet African National Congress 
President Nelson Mandela, who is almost certain to be sworn in 
as South Africa's first black state president. 
  Mr Mandela has said the composition of the cabinet in the 
Government of National Unity would be chosen at his discretion. 
  In terms of the constitution, however, Mr Mandela is obliged 
to include in his cabinet members of opposition parties that 
obtained more than five per cent of the national vote. 
  As the results stood on Monday, the NP with more than 30 per 
cent of the vote qualified for six cabinet posts and the Inkatha 
Freedom Party for one. 
  ANC spokesmen indicated at the weekend that even if parties 
did not obtain five per cent of the vote they could be 
represented in the cabinet in the interests of creating an as 
broadly representative cabinet as possible. They named Freedom 
Front [FF] leader Gen Constand Viljoen whose FF had almost four 
per cent of the vote as a possible candidate. 
  The constitution also stipulates that the second biggest 
party is entitled to nominate one of two executive deputy state 
presidents, one of whom is certain to be Mr de Klerk. 
  Other names mentioned as possible contenders for cabinet 
posts are Minister of Constitutional Development Roelf Meyer, 
Cape NP leader Dawie de Villiers, Minister of Justice and 
Defence Kobie Coetsee, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha and 
Minister of Finance Derek Keys. 
  Mr de Klerk's cabinet meets again on Wednesday, perhaps for 
the last time as the NP government.

<F P=106> [Interview with Western Cape National Party premier-elect </F>
Hernus Kriel by correspondent Barbara Folscher at the Parade in 
Cape Town -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Folscher] Good evening. At the Parade here in 
Cape Town, a large group of people has gathered. It is clear 
they are from the National Party and from the ANC. But before 
we return to them, we earlier spoke to Mr. Kriel and during the 
run-up to the election there had been a lot of criticism against 
the National Party's campaign, particularly from the ANC. It 
was said that the campaign was a racist one, and that there were 
fears in the Colored community that this aspect was being 
exploited. We asked Mr. Kriel about this. 
  [Kriel] We did not take advantage of people's fears. We 
fought a hard election campaign against the ANC. We did not 
spare them, they did not spare us. As far as my vision for the 
Western Cape region is concerned -- the Cape of Good Hope as I 
always call it -- I think that the first thing that we have to 
do is to initiate a process of reconciliation. We have to leave 
the petty politics behind, we have to take hands, we have to 
plan jointly how to improve the quality of life, especially that 
of the poor people in the region. [passage omitted]

is elephant, in Zulu. To get back to what we are actually 
supposed to be talking about, we had a talk to Dr. Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader a short while 
ago and we asked him about his impressions after this election 
and he said he had some anxieties about the few days ahead. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording] ...I think the latter. I'm very 
anxious. I mean if I look at what has happened, you know, 
during the elections in some...[pauses] with irregularities that 
have taken place, now in my mind I sort of wonder whether -- are 
you going to have any of that, any things that are hanky panky 
when it comes to counting and so on of the elections. So I've 
got that anxiety about it because of what has happened during 
elections in some parts of KwaZulu. I'm not implying that it 
happened everywhere. [end recording] 
  [Alfonso] Well the IFP leader there called it hanky panky, 
but there's no doubt that there has been some disorganized 
action here in the KwaZulu-Natal region, especially in these 
rural parts. This morning, of course, they had to move the 
ballot boxes from Ulundi to Nongoma because of possible 
political irregularities which some parties had raised with the 
IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The boxes were moved, 
but once they got to Nongoma they were also delivered at the 
wrong venue and only about 30 minutes ago they actually started 
counting at the correct venue in Nongoma, where the IEC 
officials are overseeing the whole process. We are not entirely 
sure exactly when the totals will come out, but what we do know 
is that the district electoral officer, Mrs. Crystal Williams, 
has told us that it might even take up to tomorrow evening. 
  And on another possible point of interest, we've heard that 
the IFP leader, Mr. Buthelezi, has been told either by his 
office staff or possibly a medical opinion, to take a rest and 
he is sitting out at his home in Mahlabatini and having a look, 
of course, at what is possibly the outcome on the channel where 
it happens.

<F P=106> [Address by Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini in Nongoma on 30 </F>
April--recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent Gary Alfonso] Well, good afternoon 
from Ulundi, here where that good news which we've just heard 
from the European parliamentarians has certainly also filtered 
down to this area, and we went along to King Goodwill 
Zwelithini's home at Nongoma a short while ago and there, as 
we've just remarked, well, the king says people don't talk to 
him. The king said, well, he addresses the people. This was 
the address by King Goodwill Zwelithini a short while ago: 
  [Zwelithini] The long awaited election has been held in our 
country, on the 26th, 27th, and 28th, and other regions were 
still finishing their voting process on 29 April, 1994. We all 
in our joyful stance witness the beginning of the new era in 
South Africa. We know that the international community has been 
watchfully monitoring the progress of change in this country, 
and that they have contributed a lot toward that direction. I, 
as the king of the Zulu nation, wish the entire South African 
community a joyful and prosperous transition toward their 
freedom. I say these things knowing full well that we still 
have a very long and hard road to travel. By voting we have 
just taken the first step toward the direction of our destiny, 
and we still have to take a million more steps to accomplish our 
freedom. 
  At the outset I wish to sound a very clear warning to you, 
the people of South Africa. I know that we have suffered 
uncomfortable misfortunes for many hundreds of years under the 
then apartheid system. I therefore wish to warn that whichever 
party wins the election, we must not celebrate that victory to 
the detriment of our well-being. People must not over enjoy 
themselves in such a way that other people might feel offended. 
We must not celebrate our victory in a way that will shame our 
freedom and our country. We must teach ourselves from the 
outset to respect other people and properties because that is 
our philosophy of ubuntu [humanity]. 
  It is my wish as king of the people, that the people must 
realize the basic necessities of life. Killing one another is 
surely not a basic necessity of life. I therefore urge you to 
stop doing unnecessary things. Rather take a good look at 
yourselves and try to understand what freedom means to you. I 
have a very good understanding of that. It means dedication and 
hard work. I therefore once again wish to appeal to the people 
of KwaZulu-Natal, and the rest of South Africa, to turn their 
backs against violence and squarely face the future. 
  Having said these things I now wish to place a challenge to 
you, the people of this country. You have now fought, won the 
battle, and political freedom. Let us now join hands and fight 
to win the battles of poverty, disease and ignorance. To me 
that is the final attainment of freedom. 
  The international community has helped us to win our 
political freedom. Let us now challenge them in unison to help 
us win our final freedom, which is freedom to know, freedom to 
practice, and freedom to do. We have been promised by our 
political parties a lot of good things. Let us give them a 
chance to practice what they have been promising. I myself am 
very keen on developmental projects, and I therefore promise to 
lead exemplarily toward that direction. A nation without 
development projects is doomed to fail. I urge you to join hands 
to develop South Africa to its maximum. 
  In conclusion I wish to thank the people of KwaZulu-Natal 
for 
heeding my call to go to vote. Let the example that you have 
shown in this crucial period be the (?feet) to carry you in more 
years to come. I want to thank the Almighty God for having 
saved the entire South Africa through the important period of 
our history, and I pray that you should now go back to your 
roots and practice ubuntu.

  [Text] The Democratic Party [DP] has expressed 
disappointment at its provincial results. DP leader Zach de 
Beer said at the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission] 
headquarters at Gallagher's Estate that the results were much 
worse than expected. He attributed his party's poor performance 
to National Party [NP] propaganda which had called on the 
electorate to vote for the NP to prevent domination by the 
ANC-communist party alliance. He said the DP was not 
considering merging with another party because there were no 
other attractive prospects. The DP would continue to play an 
important role as watchdog over human rights and democracy.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 30 SAPA -- Heads of the 
International Observer Missions to South Africa on Saturday [30 
April] said the elections up to the end of voting had been free. 
United Nations special representative Lakhdar Brahimi said 
everyone who had wanted to vote had been able to. 
  The observers said they could not yet comment on the 
fairness 
of the elections. 
  The heads of the European Union Election Unit and Observer 
Mission, the Commonwealth Observer Mission and the Organisation 
of African Unity Observer Mission were addressing a press 
briefing at the Independent Electoral Commission's Gallagher 
Estate offices in Midrand. 
  In a joint statement they said the elections had been 
successful despite administrative problems. 
  Former Jamaican prime minister and Commonwealth mission head 
Michael Manley said he had been impressed by the enthusiasm of 
South African voters and the good relations between black and 
white people queueing at voting stations. South Africa was on 
the threshold of rejoining the Commonwealth, Mr Manley said. 
"This is really the end of the anti-colonial struggle." 
  The joint statement read: "The people of South Africa 
clearly 
demonstrated their commitment to the end of apartheid and the 
transformation to nonracial democracy by turning out in enormous 
numbers to vote. "The escalation and spread of violence which 
was widely predicted and feared did not happen."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- A team of seven Canadian 
lawyers accredited as interational observers on Sunday [1 May] 
pronounced South Africa's first all-race elections -- especially 
the adjudication of electoral disputes -- as free and fair. 
  "On the basis of political activity and the voting of 
approximately 60 polling stations we observed, we concur with 
the European observers' conclusion that this election was 
substantially free and fair," Mr Andrew Orkin, co-ordinator of 
the legal team, said in a statement. 
  The lawyers said they had observed the Independent Electoral 
Commission's [IEC] investigation into, and settlement of, many 
complaints and nearly half of the 45 cases sent to trial or 
appeal. Although the voting and counting would invevitably lead 
to more complaints they were confident that all election 
complaints would also be dealt fairly and impartially, the 
statement said. 
  The Canadian jurists' report on the electoral complaints 
system was co-signed by the legal observers affiliated with 
Oxfam Canada and the European Community observer unit.

  [Text] Johannesburg April 30 SAPA -- The magnificent 
achievement of the SA [South African] Police [SAP] in keeping 
the election virtually violence free, shows that South Africa 
has a first rate police service, which deserves the support of 
all its people, Minister of Law and Order Mr Hernus Kriel said 
on Saturday [30 April]. "Keeping voters' faith and ensuring 
South Africa's first democratic election was not disrupted was 
probably the biggest challenge in the history of the SAP." 
  Mr Kriel said the professionalism and sheer hardwork of 
members of the force, far exceeded the call of duty. The 
performance of the police has shown that members of the force 
were fully committed to democracy and defending the constitution. 
  Mr Kriel congratulated the Commissioner of Police Gen Johan 
van der Merwe and every man and woman of the force for their 
indispensable contribution to democracy. A sincere word of 
thanks should also go to the SA National Defence Force for ably 
supporting the SAP in its task, Mr Kriel said.

  [Text] Western Transvaal was tense today, but no serious 
incidents occurred since 14 magisterial districts were declared 
unrest areas. There were earlier reports of AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] gatherings in this area and Robbie 
Terblanche went to investigate. 
  [Begin Terblanche recording] Everything seemed normal, and 
no 
serious incidents had been reported. Tension could be felt 
wherever we spoke to people, and nobody was prepared to appear 
on camera. There was a strong army and police presence. Several 
road blocks were set up. According to the police liaison 
officer for Western Transvaal, Captain Koos Degenaar, the step 
to declare 14 magisterial districts unrest areas was taken 
mainly to prevent unrest, conflict, and violence. We received a 
report that AWB members had gathered in the Koster region but we 
could not confirm this during our visit. Our investigation at 
Koster led to cameraman Roy Freeman and myself being stopped by 
police between Koster and Lichtenburg and escorted to the 
Lichtenburg police station. They wanted to confiscate our video 
material but they released us after viewing the material. 
According to the police people are very tense and they are 
receiving several calls from concerned people. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg May 2 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress had by 1PM on Monday [2 May] received 57.9 per cent of 
the votes for the National Assembly, followed by the National 
Party [NP] (26.2 per cent) and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
(7.5 per cent), according to provisional figures released by the

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress was on Monday [2 May] morning headed for victory in 
South Africa's first all-race election, but conceded it had lost 
to the National Party in the Western Cape. Based on provisional 
results received form the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
by 12.30AM on Monday , when more than five million votes had 
been counted, it also appeared unlikely the ANC would capture 
the two-thirds majority which the party's opponents say it 
requires to write its own constitution. 
  The ANC led the National Assembly vote count with 2,816,816 
or 55 per cent, followed by the NP [National Party] with 
1,584,367 or 30.9 per cent. 
  In another development the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
appeared headed for elegibility for inclusion in the Government 
of National Unity, having captured over five per cent of the 
vote for the National Assembly. 
  ANC Information Secretary Dr Pallo Jordan told a 
Johannesburg 
news conference on Sunday evening his party expected to win at 
least 58 per cent of the national vote. 
  The results up to Sunday evening showed three patterns: 
majority support for the ANC nationally and in seven of the nine 
provinces, majority support for the NP in the Western Cape, and 
a strong showing by the Inkatha Freedom Party in Natal/KwaZulu. 
  In the National Assembly vote, the IFP edged into third 
place 
with 260,357 or 5.1 per cent, overtaking both the Freedom Front 
[FF] of Gen Constand Viljoen during the course of the day's 
counting and the Democratic Party [DP ]. The FF had 3.5 per cent 
with 180,146 votes and the DP 2.6 per cent or 131,284 votes. 
  They were followed by the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] with 
1.2 per cent and the African Christian Democratic Party with 0.6 
per cent. 
  All the other parties had less than 0.5 per cent of the 
total 
votes counted. 
  In the Western Cape, where political parties vied for the 
support of the majority coloured population, NP premiership 
candidate Hernus Kriel looked set to become the first NP leader 
to secure a top position under the interim constitution. The NP 
had 57.6 per cent and the ANC 25.1 per cent. 
  In KwaZulu/Natal the IFP was leading with 47.3 per cent. The 
ANC followed with 33.8 per cent. 
  In the other seven provinces, the ANC took the lead with 
generally large majorities. 
  The coloured vote appeared not to come to the rescue of the 
NP in the Northern Cape, where the ANC had 49.8 per cent 
followed by the NP with 38.4 per cent. 
  In other provinces, the ANC's lead was even bigger. 
  The NP failed to realise earlier hopes of a strong showing 
in 
the Orange Free State where the ANC had 67.8 per cent and the NP 
13.1 per cent. 
  In North West Province, which includes much of the former 
Bophuthatswana homeland, the ANC had 72.6 per cent, the NP had 
15.3 per cent and the FF 9.2 per cent. 
  In the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], said to 
be 
an ANC stronghold, the NP was making a strong showing with 24.8 
per cent of the vote, holding the ANC down to 51.5 per cent. The 
FF was third with 7.1 per cent and the DP fourth also with 7.1 
per cent. 
  In the Eastern Transvaal, the ANC had a majority of 74.5 per 
cent. 
  In the Eastern Cape, the ANC 65.7 per cent of the votes 
counted, followed by the NP with 22.7 per cent. 
  In the Northern Transvaal, the ANC led with 79.3 per cent 
followed by the NP with 8.9 per cent. 
  The showing of the FF could see it offered a cabinet 
position 
in a new Government of National Unity. The DP's position looked 
less secure. 
  Reports of electoral irregularities mounted. They included 
the discovery of hundreds of thousands of unused ballot papers 
hidden in warehouses on the East and West Rand and the use of 
"pirate voting stations" in the Durban area. 
  In a statement later on Sunday, the IEC said the 
investigation into missing ballot papers and distribution 
mechanisms in the PWV would soon be completed and the results 
would be made public. 
  An IEC investigation team, led by attorneys, was working 
with 
the SA Police, after IEC Monitoring Directorate Chief Director 
Peter Harris ordered the probe on Wednesday April 27 when it was 
discovered thousands of papers were missing. 
  Search warrants had been issued and a number of people would 
be questioned, the IEC statement said. 
  In spite of irregularities, which NP leader Mr F W de Klerk 
described as "widespread," counting went ahead slowly in 
hundreds of counting stations across the country. IEC officials 
said they hoped to be in a position to issue full provisional 
results on monday night. 
  The IEC estimated South Africa's electoral population at 
22.5 
million, which meant about 17 million votes had yet to be 
considered. 
  Four major counting centres, Umtata, Durban, Pretoria and 
Nasrec (Johannesburg) -- representing the largest slice of the 
election results -- all reported massive backlogs and were 
running way behind schedule. 
  At Durban counting was retarded or was not proceeding at 32 
of 60 counting centres. A crisis team had been sent to deal with 
the problem. In the entire KwaZulu/Natal Province, only 10 of 
the 106 stations had completed counting. 
  At Umtata only six of the 61 stations had completed 
counting, 
50 were counting and two were still reconciling ballots votes. 
In Eastern Cape province, of which Transkei and Ciskei are a 
part, 28 of 107 stations had finished counting. 
  At Pretoria counting only started late on Sunday night and 
at 
Nasrec counting officers were still unsure of procedure and 
monitors were assisting with the process. 
  vereeniging reported nine per cent complete, the West Rand 
52 
per cent, East Rand 47 per cent and Johannesburg 15 per cent. 
All told, 24.6 per cent of the counting at the PWV's 141 
stations had been completed. 
  In the Northern Transvaal, where counting started late, only 
11 of 38 centres had completed their work. 
  Progress at other regions was better: 
  in the Western Cape 48 centres out of 58 had completed 
counting; in the Orange Free State 49 of the 75 centres were 
complete; the North West 37 out of 49; Eastern Transvaal 36 of 
47; and the Northern Cape, 20 out of 32. 
  Foreign voting at the DHL warehouse at Isando was reported 
as 
still proceeding very slowly.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 1 SAPA -- Hundreds of thousands of 
missing ballot papers have been found in two warehouses in the 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area, the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] said on Sunday [1 May]. 
  IEC Commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said people had been 
subpoenaed to answer questions about the papers found in 
warehouses on the East Rand and West Rand. Investigations were 
continuing, Mr Moseneke said. A shortage of ballot papers in 
the PWV caused long queues at polling stations in the region on 
Tuesday and Wednesday.

  [Text] Bujumbura, 2 May (PANA) -- Bujumbura is once again 
filled by bird songs and no gun shot has been heard in the last 
two days, not even in the district of Kamenge, north of the 
capital, the main battlefield between the populations of the 
majority Hutu ethnic group and the Tutsi-dominated Army. 
According to witnesses, public and private transporters resumed 
operations Monday [2 May], even if the schools, markets, 
hospitals and health centres of the northern outskirts of 
Bujumbura remained closed (following the outbeak of the crisis 
in October 1993). 
  The Armed Forces during last week moved the populace to 
search all the houses of the Kamenge District and seized all the 
weapons illegally held by its inhabitants. No detail has been 
given as for the number of weapons found. Meanwhile, the death 
toll from the disturbances in the district has also not been 
specified, perhaps because of the large numbers killed on both 
sides. Observers have said, however, that 14 anti-tank rockets, 
all kinds of pistols, AK-47s and automatic rifles were seized. 
According to official figures, about 10,000 people affected by 
the police search were held for 24 hours, in poor conditions, in 
the capital's large "Prince Louis Rwagasore" Stadium of the 
capital last week. 
  The new head of state, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, visited 
them 
on Saturday before they were released.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 2 (AFP) -- The rebel Rwanda Patriotic 
Front (RPF) said Monday [2 May] it will send a delegation to 
Arusha, Tanzania, on Tuesday to explain its stand on the Rwandan 
conflict to the Tanzanian president -- but not to meet Rwandan 
Government representatives. 
  In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation 
monitored here, RPF's military spokesman Emmanuel Idahiro said 
RPF could not negotiate with a "government of criminals," but 
its commanders were willing to meet government forces' 
commanders to discuss peace. 
  "We are going to Tanzania to see and give our views to the 
head of state, the views about the situation in our country now 
...we are not going to Tanzania to meet with the so-called 
government because we have told you that this government is a 
government of criminals," Idahiro said. 
  Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi said Sunday his 
country 
would host peace talks between the RPF and the interim 
governemnt in the northern town of Arusha. 
  A United Nations spokesman in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, 
told AFP Monday that the interim governement in Rwanda will send 
a delegation composed of both civilain and military 
representatives to Arusha. 
  Idahiro said RPF had taken control of Rwanda's border with 
Tanzania but denied that the RPF had blockaded the frontier to 
prevent Rwandan refugees from fleeing into Tanzania. 
  More than 100,000 Rwandans, many of them from the minority 
Tutsi ethnic group, have been killed since the death of 
President Juvenal Habyarimana, from the majority Hutu group, in 
an April 6 rocket attack on his plane, according to aid agencies 
and human rights organisations.

  [Text] Dakar, 2 May (KNA/PANA) -- African countries should 
show more determination in ending death and destruction in 
Rwanda, that country's Planning Minister Augustin Ngirabatware 
said yesterday. 
  He told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY that his government 
expected Africa to convene an emergency meeting asking the 
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni to halt his military 
assistance to the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF]. The front is 
fighting the government for the control of the capital, Kigali. 
  Despite repeated denials from Kampala, the Kigali government 
maintains the Ugandan Government has been supporting the front 
since the beginning of the guerrilla war in October 1990. 
  Ngirabatware is in Dakar to deliver a message from the new 
Rwanda head of state Theodore Sindikubwabo to the Senegalese 
President Abdou Diouf. The envoy has delivered similar messages 
to the leaders of Gabon and Togo. 
  We wish to conclude a ceasefire with the RPF. This is a 
prerequisite to any discussion, he said. He said that the 
crisis could only be solved through negotiations in Arusha 
Tanzania, being brokered by Tanzanian President Ali Hassan 
Mwinyi.

  [Text] The prefect of Cyangugu, Mr. (Emmanuel Mbagamiki), 
has just delivered, to OZRT [Zairian Radio and Television 
Office] in Bukavu, a denial that we are going to read for you--a 
denial of a report broadcast by our station this morning 
concerning massacres in Cyangugu. The same information was also 
broadcast by other radio and television stations. Here is what 
the prefect of Cyangugu said: 
  Following the serious events that have shaken Rwanda since 
the death of the president of the Republic on 6 April, and the 
resumption of hostilities by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
[words indistinct] (?7) April, thousands of people of all ethnic 
groups and nationalities have been forced to flee their homes. 
These displaced people took refuge wherever they thought they 
would be protected from people's anger and [words indistinct] 
RPF combatants' weapons. 
  In Cyangugu Prefecture, certain displaced people were taken 
to Cyangugu Stadium. There were (?5,126) people there on 22-23 
April when Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] of the International 
Committee of the Red Cross in Bukavu paid us a visit and left a 
certain quantity of drugs for them. All these displaced persons 
are still in the stadium. The shots heard on 29 April were 
weapons fired by members of the security forces, who were 
dispersing looters and robbers who were attempting to grab the 
few belongings which the displaced had managed to bring with 
them. 
  (?A state of) confusion ensued when some of the displaced 
panicked, [words indistinct] the stadium [words indistinct]. 
Only a few of them took refuge elsewhere, and all the others who 
are there presently -- around 5,492 -- returned there under the 
vigilant protection of the gendarmerie. To the best of my 
knowledge, no shots were ever fired in the stadium, and no [word 
indistinct] has ever been used by the Army in the stadium or its 
surroundings. 
  The prefect of Cyangugu Prefecture has made an appointment 
with Mr. (Georges) [word indistinct] for 2 May to exchange 
information and [words indistinct] to be made known to 
international public opinion [words indistinct].

<F P=106> [Interview with President Miguel Trovoada by correspondent </F>
Walter Medeiros in Lisbon on 29 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Social Democratic Party will today, Saturday, 
hold its already traditional Lisbon Meeting at the Riba Fria 
Estate on the outskirts of Sintra. It is something along the 
lines of an international get-together to reflect on political 
and economic issues. Among those present this year will be, 
among others, Mozambique's foreign minister, the secretary 
general of Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola], and Miguel Trovoada, the president of the Republic of 
Sao Tome and Principe. Earlier this evening the latter granted 
an interview to our colleague Walter Medeiros. 
  [Medeiros] Good evening, Mr. President. 
  [Trovoada] Good evening. 
  [Medeiros] I would like to begin with a question to which 
some political analysts have been addressing themselves of late, 
that of the very survival of the state of Sao Tome. Twenty 
years after the Portuguese April 1974 revolution, many observers 
are saying that Sao Tome and Principe and, by the way, Cape 
Verde as well, do not need to be independent, that an autonomous 
status similar to that enjoyed by Madeira and the Azores might 
be a better solution. They back their argument with the fact 
that Sao Tome and Principe, for example, subsists practically on 
foreign aid, that the feebleness of its economy makes 
self-sufficiency impossible. What are your views on this, Mr. 
President? 
  [Trovoada] I think those are people nostalgic for the 
colonial era who have not yet realized that history moves on, 
that some of its stages must be left behind, that the historical 
process is irreversible. You mentioned economic problems that 
might lead some people to wonder about Sao Tome's viability as a 
state. I would point out that Sao Tome is not the only state 
depending on external aid, there are numerous cases.... 
  [Medeiros, interrupting] But its dependence is huge. You do 
recognize that, don't you? 
  [Trovoada] The dependence is huge. The dependence is huge, 
but it is only a temporary stage. We must not forget that ours 
is still a type of economy that was not created in the interests 
of the Sao Tomeans, but rather in those of the colonial power. 
This is an important point. Most African countries have not 
yet managed to get out of this kind of situation. 
  [Medeiros] Mr. President, is democracy not in danger in Sao 
Tome? 
  [Trovoada] Democracy is in danger wherever there is an 
inability to solve the basic problems of the populations. 
  [Medeiros] That is what is happening in Sao Tome. 
  [Trovoada] It is happening in many countries. 
  [Medeiros] Including Sao Tome? 
  [Trovoada] Including Sao Tome and Principe. It is true that 
there is disenchantment stemming from the fact that the people 
had pinned great hopes in seeing their problems solved by the 
establishment of a democratic system. They were expecting 
immediate results. 
  [Medeiros] Some three or four years have already gone by, 
Mr. 
President. 
  [Trovoada] Yes, but well, listen, have all of Portugal's 
problems been solved in the 20 years since April 1974? 
  [Medeiros] Of course not. 
  [Trovoada] We are talking here in connection with the 20th 
anniversary of the 25 April revolution. Have all of Portugal's 
problems been solved? 
  [Medeiros] Of course not. 
  [Trovoada] Right. So it seems that there is tendency to 
expect miracles from the African countries that other peoples 
are unable to perform. Democracy in the African 
countries....[pauses] As soon as there is the slightest 
turbulence it is immediately seen as evidence of the African 
peoples' inability to manage a democratic system. How many 
centuries did it take the other countries, namely the European 
ones, to establish democratic systems? Let us not lay down 
criteria for African countries that are not applied to others. 
  [Medeiros] Speaking of managing. At the very beginning of 
your term of office, Mr. President, I believe you had to manage 
a crisis. The government fell, the prime minister was replaced, 
and there was a huge movement of popular protest in Sao Tome. 
Relations between yourself, President Trovoada, and the 
government, are not exactly the best. How do you deal about 
this, Mr. President? 
  [Trovoada] I do not agree with your view that there is a 
lack 
of institutional cooperation. We -- namely the president of the 
republic -- must deal with the situation within the framework of 
our institutions, of our Constitution, with absolute strict 
respect for boundaries defining each body's area of jurisdiction. 
  [Medeiros] But there have been clashes, Mr. President. 
  [Trovoada] I say it again: Can you name anywhere in the 
world 
where such clashes do not occur? Not the United States, not 
Portugal, not even the world's oldest democracies. As I said 
before, let us not hope for miracles from the African countries 
that others have not performed and are in no position to perform. 
  [Medeiros] Do you not fear that there may at present be a 
certain nostalgia for former President Pinto da Costa? 
  [Trovoada] That is a question that should be addressed to 
former President Pinto da Costa. 
  [Medeiros] But do you not fear it? Surely you have your 
opinion polls. 
  [Trovoada] Fear? Fear? 
  [Medeiros] Yes, yes. 
  [Trovoada] Why? We have a democracy. Former President 
Pinto da Costa is a Sao Tomean citizen. He was our country's 
first head of state. He certainly has a role to play in Sao 
Tome and Principe. Therefore, I do not see why in a democracy 
one should be afraid of a citizen like any other. 
  [Medeiros] Mr. President, I would like to take the 
opportunity of this interview to raise the Francophone versus 
Lusophone question. Allow me to explain: There are increasingly 
insistent voices pointing to a growing French presence, not just 
in Sao Tome and Principe, but also in Guinea Bissau and 
throughout that part of Africa. I will give you an example: 
Under its cooperation agreement with Sao Tome and Principe, 
Portugal has paid for the construction of the Principe dam that 
will provide electricity for the island of the same name. Now 
people are saying that when the power station is ready it will 
be run by the French. Moreover, there is also the question of 
the media -- television, radio, and so on. Only recently, I 
believe, there was an agreement signed with Radio France 
International. Is this because the Sao Tomean elite is markedly 
influenced by Francophone culture? What is going on? 
  [Trovoada] I am frankly astounded.... 
  [Medeiros, interrupting] I would just like you to clear this 
up for me. 
  [Trovoada] No, but I am astounded when such questions are 
put 
to me. 
  [Medeiros] But it is good that they should be asked. 
  [Trovoada] Why so? 
  [Medeiros] So as to clarify matters. 
  [Trovoada] Why? You know, I lived in France for nine years 
during my second term of exile. There are hundreds of thousands 
of Portuguese in France. You also know that nowadays French 
interests are increasingly represented in Portugal. And yet no 
one is afraid that Napoleon Bonaparte, or a new Napoleon, might 
land on Portuguese shores, or cross the Pyrenees bent on 
invasion. 
  [Medeiros] It is not my personal view, I am merely echoing 
concerns. 
  [Trovoada] I fail to see why people should still regard 
Africa as a game reserve for competing hunters. We are 
independent countries, we have the most open of relationships 
with various states.... 
  [Madeiros, interrupting] And a special one with Portugal? 
  [Trovoada] In the context of cooperation, relationships are 
made special by historical and cultural ties, as is 
particularly, the case regarding Portugal. But we are open to 
cooperation with other countries. It seems to me tantamount to 
treating us as though we were underage, if people think that 
because we have relations with country A, B, or C, it must 
follow that we have a special relationship or wish to be taken 
into its sphere of influence. 
  You mentioned the Principe dam built by Portugal. In effect 
I formally opened it about a year ago. I must tell you that it 
has not yet come into operation. 
  [Medeiros] Quite so. 
  [Trovoada] So when you talk about France running it, I do 
not 
know how France can run something that has not come into 
operation. 
  [Medeiros] No, I said France will be running it when it is 
ready. 
  [Trovoada] Well, we are in the here and now....[pauses] As 
for the matter of future intent, we do not know. 
  [Medeiros] But don't the French run the whole of Sao Tome's 
electricity supply grid? 
  [Trovoada] But is that in any way an anomalous situation? I 
must tell you, in effect our water and electricity supply 
networks are run by a French company, yes, operating with huge 
subsidies from France -- for equipment, for fuel, and everything 
else. If we are speaking about running things, it is a known 
fact that there are Portuguese companies in Sao Tome and 
Principe in much better positions than French ones, such as 
Marconi with its Sao Tomean subsidiary CST [expansion unknown], 
such as TAP [Air Portugal] with Sao Tomean Airlines, such as our 
sole commercial bank, the BISTP [expansion unknown], whose 
majority holdings are Portuguese. 
  [Medeiros] So the more anxious spirits can be reassured that 
Portugal has its role in Sao Tome; our ties with Sao Tome will 
definitely not be loosened... 
  [Trovoada, interrupting] Portugal has its role in Sao Tome. 
I am convinced that Portugal will continue playing a role in 
Lusophone Africa, and the bigger that role the better, but the 
Lusophone African countries are now independent and are totally 
at liberty to establish ties also with other countries, in their 
interest, and in the interest of the development of their 
peoples. 
  [Medeiros] The voting has ended in the South African 
elections. How do you envisage the future for South Africa? 
Very quickly, if you would, Mr. President, as we are running 
out of time. 
  [Trovoada] It is an extraordinary process, yet again a 
historical process of extraordinary importance, insofar as it 
signals the end of a regime, frankly, words fail one to qualify 
it -- the apartheid regime, and ushers in a new era of democracy 
for the entire South African people. I can say that, as far as 
we Africans, the black community in general, are concerned, this 
is a high point in the history of this community. And for 
mankind too, it is a high point, as a climate of greater 
fraternity, greater equality, and inextricably, greater freedom 
begins to be established in South Africa. 
  [Medeiros] Have a good stay in Portugal, Mr. President. 
Thank you for coming to Antenna-1's midnight newsreel. 
  [Trovoada] Thank you very much. Good night.

  [Text] Abdirahman Ahmed Ali, the chairman of the Somali 
National Movement, SNM, has issued in Addis Ababa a press 
statement in which SNM has clarified its readiness to 
participate in future conferences held by Somali organizations. 
Mr. Abdirahman said that the SNM delegation, led by himself, 
and the Somali National Alliance [SNA] delegation, led by 
Chairman Mohamed Farah Aidid, met in Addis Ababa between 25-29 
April this year, and discussed various issues -- including 
current efforts to reconcile the Somalis, the settlement of any 
unresolved problems, and the search for a solution that is 
satisfactory to all parties, which will bring the crisis to an 
end and prevent the further destruction of the Somali people. 
  In conclusion, the SNM chairman and his delegation thanked 
the chairman and the SNA delegation for their tireless efforts, 
the value that Mr. Aidid places on the role of the SNM, and his 
constant invitations to talks concerning the reconciliation of 
Somali people. The SNM has issued the following clarifications 
in connection with the present situation in Somalia. 
  1. The experience gained during the last three years clearly 
shows that the path followed by the Somali people, whether in 
the north or south of the country, toward settling the 
differences which emerged from the struggle against the 
dictatorial regime of Siad Barre, have so far not achieved the 
goal of stability or created a government that is better than 
the former one for Somali people. 
  2. In looking at these issues, we should have realized that 
the Somali people cannot continue along a path that leads to 
national suicide or to a failure to create a reliable government 
or mini- states. 
  3. The international community has tried to help the Somali 
people in every way and assist them toward finding a way out of 
the current intolerable situation, but so far nothing has 
succeeded, and the international community has acknowledged that 
it should leave the Somali people to choose either a resolution 
of their differences or a reversion back to a primitive era, 
where they are unable to maintain sovereignty or government. 
  4. It is therefore indispensible that Somali organizations 
meet soon and realisticaly work together toward finding a middle 
ground for compromise, so as to save the Somali nation and 
people from ruin. 
  5. In considering the Somaliland situation in the north, Mr. 
Abdirahman said the time had come when people should realize 
that the international community does not accept the path so far 
pursued by Somaliland toward recognition. The international 
community has clarified that it is up to Somalis to decide 
whether they will remain as one country or disintegrate into 
smaller different countries. Mr. Abdirahman Ahmed Ali said that 
Somali people living in the north and south of the country 
should sit down together and settle (?differences) through the 
wishes and rights of the people of the north and decide whether 
they will secede or will strengthen the unity and brotherhood of 
Somali people. 
  6. At the time the Siad Barre regime was toppled in 1991, 
the 
SNM had succeeded in creating peace and reconciliation among 
those communities belonging to the SNM as well as with others in 
the north. During the last several months the SNM has 
established contact and understanding between the SNM and other 
political organizations in the north. He said the SNM is now 
ready to make official contacts. 
  7. It is important that these issues be dealt with directly 
and that further talks take place among the various Somali 
groups, so as to arrive at a tangible solution to the 
differences and misunderstandings that have so far deprived the 
Somali people of a stable, tangible government. He said that 
the SNM will participate in all future Somali reconciliation 
conferences, as it has done before. 
  8. The SNM will adopt a position of neutrality concerning 
differences among the various groups, and will strive to narrow 
these differences in the best way, while eliminating mistrust. 
  9. After the SNM carries out its internal consultations and 
after it consults with communities outside the SNM and other 
political organizations, it will present a proposal based on a 
Federal Government, with every state having regional autonomy.

  [Text] Mohamed Farah Aidid, the chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance, SNA, and of the United Somali Congress, today 
said in a press release that the SNA welcomed the Somali 
National Movement's [SNM] decision to fully participate in 
meetings, conferences, and consultations aimed at reconciling 
the Somali people. 
  Aidid said in the press release that the SNA and SNM 
leadership had been meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for a 
week. The SNA chairman added that the two sides had reached an 
understanding to the effect that Somalia's sovereignty and 
dignity was sacred. He said the SNA highly valued and welcomed 
the SNM's participation in the reconciliation conferences and 
consultations. Aidid further said in his press release that the 
SNM's move would restore lasting peace and help the formation of 
a single government and nation and the reconstruction of the 
country. Aidid expressed the hope that very soon we would be 
able to overcome our internal problems. In the light of the new 
political initiative, he urged the international community, 
particularly the donor countries, to continue to have confidence 
in the Somali people's abilities to resolve their internal 
differences through dialogue.

  [Text] Addis Ababa, April 29 (AFP) -- Separatist 
Somaliland's former president called here Friday [29 April] for 
the country to rejoin its southern neighbour Somalia, from which 
it seceded unilaterally in May 1991. 
  Abdulrahman Ahmed Ali, the first head of state after 
secession, told journalists in the Ethiopian capital: "It is 
time our people understood clearly that the international 
community does not intend to recognise Somaliland." He added 
that Somalis in the north and south "should sit down together to 
sort out their problems." 
  Ahmed Ali, who was joined at a press conference by warlord 
General Mohamed Farah Aidid, heads the Somali National Movement 
(SNM), instrumental in overthrowing Somali president Mohamed 
Siad Barre in January 1991. Ahmed Ali and Aidid are key players 
in ongoing efforts to secure a stable political future for the 
factionally-riven Horn of Africa nation following the withdrawal 
last month of the US contingent and other western troops from 
the United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia. 
  Ahmed Ali said the SNM, which is reportedly riven by 
internal 
strife, would attend a meeting of the main Somali factions 
scheduled for May 10 in Nairobi. The UN-brokered meeting has 
been called to pave the way for a national reconciliation 
conference. 
  Aidid, who has been absent from Mogadishu for five months, 
welcomed Ahmed Ali's declaration on Somaliland. 
  But the current president of Somaliland, Mohamed Egal, said 
Ahmed Ali's remarks amounted to "treason." 
  He told AFP by telephone from Hargeysa: "Mr Ahmed Ali only 
speaks for himself. He is an individual and does not represent 
Somaliland." Somaliland's self-declared independence was 
"irrevocable," he added.

  [Text] Since noon, the successor to President 
Houphouet-Boigny at the head of Democratic Party of Cote 
d'Ivoire-African Democratic Rally [PDCI-RDA] has been known. 
Henry Konan Bedie has become PDCI chairman. He was unanimously 
elected by PDCI activists, who took the big hall of the Palais 
de Congress by storm this morning during an extraordinary 
congress of the party. All the top-level dignitaries of the 
PDCI were in attendance. After being designated by the 
participants, the president accepted the mandate. Here is an 
extract of his statement: 
  [Begin Bedie recording] We are also happy about the support 
committees, which are springing up throughout the country to 
back our actions at the head of the state and government. These 
committees, formed by civil organizations, are renovators. The 
bedrock of our fight for development, social progress, and 
peace, these organizations are from today support committees for 
the forces of peace -- for all our forces for peace -- 
committees for the defense of our liberties, committees for the 
respect of law and republican order, committees for civic action 
and for political, economic and social mobilization, and 
committees for the nation and for development. In brief, 
comittees for the defense of PDCI-RDA ideals. 
  Let us now turn to the most-shared concerns of our 
compatriots: human and pastoral hydraulics and rural sites. I 
commit herewith the prime minister and the government to tackle 
the rehabilitation of village and rural communities' wells and 
feeder roads. We can do this without confounding the party and 
the state -- and without waiting -- as more than 3 billion CFA 
francs have been budgeted for the well-being of the rural 
population. 
  Dear participants, we shall undertake these works 
immediately, rehabilitating sites in northern Cote d'Ivoire 
first because of the rainy season, and we shall continue after 
the main rainy season in the forest areas. Dear participants, a 
new wind is blowing over Cote d'Ivoire -- let us seize this 
opportunity through a permanent and lasting mobilization. The 
exemplary holding of the extraordinary congress shows that there 
are no cleavages or camps in our great party, as our detractors 
had hoped for. The congress has shown that we remain united. 
This unity is nourished and maintained by our permanent ideal 
of peace, an ideal which shall be our first objective throughout 
our mandate. President Houphouet-Boigny liked to say that his 
force, his capacity for action, came from the presence of a 
prime minister and a PDCI secretary general at his sides -- and 
especially from a party behind him. [end recording]

  [Text] Although the Liberian Transitional Council is 
standing in place, and a slow process of demobilizing the 
warring factions is now under way, the problems for Liberia are 
far from over. For weeks now, bitter fighting has been going on 
between factions within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia], and today, there are further reports of 
fresh fighting between Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces and 
Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn fighters on the road to ULIMO 
headquarters at Tubmanburg. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison 
telexed this report: 
  The fighting intensified there along the Clay-Tubmanburg 
Highway. Villagers fleeing the war zone said that both Krahns 
and Mandingos are targeting elements of the Gola and Vai ethnic 
groups, the original inhabitants of Bomi County. We are not 
part of their war, but we are the ones dying innocently, said 
Francis Ramsoa, a Gola. The situation has caused a further 
movement of villagers into displaced camps in the Po River 
community, 20 km northwest of Monrovia. They said fighters on 
the two opposing sides were breaking down doors and windows and 
burning down houses of civilians suspected of supporting either 
side. According to the villagers, hundreds of others, mostly 
old people, were left behind in the frenzy to flee. I don't 
know what has happened to my father. He could not run and the 
bullets were sounding closer. So, I ran, leaving him behind, 
(Wusu Williams) explained, sobbing in tears. She said fighters 
of both sides had instituted forced conscription and were 
compelling villagers to carry looted items on their heads. If 
you refuse, you are shot at on the spot, she added. Aid workers 
said about 150 panic-stricken villagers arrived on Saturday [30 
April] alone in (Kamara) village which is already swarming with 
2,000 refugees, mainly women, children, and the elderly. 
Reports from several sources in the capital said further 
clashes were continuing between the two sides to control the 
ambushed village, a town 30 miles northwest of Monrovia. 
  The field commander of Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces, 
Mohamed Duguya, in a statement on Saturday, ordered all 
civilians to leave the area and called for the withdrawal of 
African peacekeeping troops deployed in the area.

Liberian Peace Council and Charles Taylor's NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia]. And reports are now emerging of 
fresh incidents involving what appears to be groups of 
indisciplined NPFL fighters, impatient at the long delays in the 
demobilization process. (Jonathan Payleily) has been traveling 
around the Nimba County in north-eastern Liberia and he telexed 
us this report from the NPFL capital, Gbarnga: 
  In one incident two weeks ago, a group of 15 heavily-armed 
men, under the command of an NPFL general, entered Zaou, a 
township 15 miles north of Ganta, at night. According to 
eyewitnesses, they held residents, including pregnant women, at 
gunpoint, then they beat them and stole their money, cattle, and 
a large quantity of rice. The NPFL commander who headed the 
group was said to be taking revenge for a relative who was 
involved in a local property dispute. 
  While visiting the area last week, I spoke to a victim of 
the 
assault, an elderly man who told me he was flogged, tortured, 
and detained for one week in the town of Sakripie, where the 
soldiers are said to have come from. NPFL soldiers in Ganta 
told me that the commander of the raiding team was later 
arrested by NPFL forces and is now under investigation. 
  In another district, Tapeta, 53 miles north of Ganta, 
harassment cases are being brought every day before the district 
commissioner. In an incident two weeks ago, armed soldiers went 
into a nearby village, firing into the air and taking people's 
belongings as they fled away.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has 
described the fuel scarcity being experienced nationwide as 
artificial. In his message on workers' May Day celebrations in 
Kaduna today, Gen. Abacha explained that the problem was caused 
by selfish and unpatriotic elements who do not want to see the 
progress of the nation. The commander in chief warned that 
government would clamp down on their activities with 
ruthlessness to solve the problem. 
  The message, which was read by the administrator of Kaduna 
State, Colonel Lawal Jafaru Issa, (?lauded) Nigerian workers for 
their courage and wisdom. The head of state asked the workers 
not to be misguided by selfish politicians and their 
collaborators in the business and financial sector, that are 
bent on sabotaging government's efforts to improve the welfare 
of the people. 
  He said government was aware of the suffering of the worker, 
and would ameliorate it by tackling fiscal and monetary policies 
that would bring about reductions in prices of goods. Gen. Sani 
Abacha announced that the Federal Government was currently 
creating structures for the implementation of the Nigerian 
Social Insurance Trust Fund Decree, to replace the National 
Providence Fund, aimed at advancing the welfare of workers. 
  According to him, government has granted the sum of $385,000 
for the running of the Organization of African Trade Union Unity 
this year, while it has also ratified the International Labor 
Organization Convention 104 and 155.

  [Text] The Federal Government today held a meeting with 
major and independent oil marketers in the country, in the 
ongoing efforts to find a solution to the petroleum problem of 
fuel scarcity, which has persisted for some time in the country. 
Also in attendance were officials of the Ministry of Petroleum 
and Mineral Resources, NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation], NUPENG [National Union of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas Workers], and (PENGASEN) [expansion unknown]. 
  In a press statement issued from the office of the chief of 
general staff, the government said in the course of the meeting 
it was identified that the current crisis is as a result of 
cummulative lapses in the maintainance of NNPC infrastructure in 
the past few years. It was reportedly acknowledged by all 
participants that concrete and adequate measures are currently 
being put in place to deal with the situation. 
  According to the statement, oil marketers have pledged to 
put 
in place adequate control measures to help in checking any 
diversion of petroleum products, while necessary measures are to 
be taken to remove all lapses that have been identified within 
the distribution system. The Federal Government said it wishes 
to assure the public that necessary machineries are already put 
in place, to bring the current situation under control and 
restore normalcy to the distribution of petroleum products in 
the country.

  [Text] A week after taking office, the new Togolese prime 
minister, Edem Kodjo, has still not formed his government. 
There are internal squabbles within the opposition majority. 
Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR], which holds the 
majority in the assembly, refuses to participate in the Edem 
Kodjo cabinet. Consultations seem to be going on between CAR and 
Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy. After assuming his 
position, Edem Kodjo declared his intentions. Here is Edem 
Kodjo talking to Olabire da Cruz. 
  [Begin recording] We are anxious to act in a manner that 
will 
permit our country to swiftly regain its rightful place within 
the community of nations as a vanguard African country. To 
achieve this, we need to quickly normalize our relations with 
financial institutions and begin national reconstruction and 
economic recovery. Social stability and security are also 
priorities. They constitute an essential aspect of the program 
which the parliamentary majority parties seek to pursue and 
thereby ensure success. [end recording]

  [Editorial report] Editor Gwen Lister writes in the 
"Political Perspective" column on page 6 of Windhoek THE 
NAMIBIAN in English on 22 April that "reconciliation has had 
varied degrees of success in Namibian society since the 
implementation of this policy by SWAPO [South-West African 
People's Organization] shortly after coming to power. It has 
had a surprising degree of success, for instance, in the new 
Namibia Defence Force (NDF), but the same cannot be said of the 
Namibian Police which is almost totally polarised at this 
stage." "Members of the public cannot help but notice the rift 
in the ranks of the Namibian Police, a rift that appears to be 
growing on an almost daily basis. In this case, however, the 
division is almost exclusively between black and white." Lister 
believes "there appears to be a tendency on the part of certain 
white police officers to bide their time for a golden 
handshake," which "does not demonstrate commitment on the part 
of those who have already gone for this option." The Namibian 
police force, "which has a mammoth task ahead of it, 
particularly in the combatting of increased crime, cannot be 
effective if it remains so divided. Unity among the ranks, 
whether black or white, must be brought about if the force is to 
earn the respect of the people."

  [Text] Pretoria May 2 SAPA -- Two South African Police 
[SAP] generals named in the Goldstone Report on "third force" 
activities would return to work soon, SAP commissioner Gen Johan 
van der Merwe said on Monday [2 May]. He said in a statement he 
had ordered Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux back to work 
on Monday, saying no grounds existed for them to stay away. 
  The two generals and a third, Krappies Engelbrecht, were 
implicated in a report by Mr Justice Richrd Goldstone on March 
18. The report said there was prima facie evidence of the 
generals' involvement in third force activities and gun running. 
  They were suspended by President F W de Klerk pending an 
investigation into the allegations. 
  Gen van der Merwe said he had made his decision after 
consultations with Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. "I 
am convinced the evidence which Dr d'Oliveira has in his 
possession at this stage is not of such a nature that the two 
generals should be withdrawn from service as a result thereof. 
  "Even though the generals voluntarily withdrew from service 
the investigation could still continue for several months and 
due to a lack of grounds for such withdrawal it can no longer be 
permitted," Gen van der Merwe said.

  [Text] Pretoria, South Africa, May 2 (YONHAP) -- South 
Africa has proposed to South Korea that an agreement to open a 
direct air route be concluded, South Korean Ambassador Choe 
Sang-tok said Monday [2 May]. 
  "The air agreement should be concluded first for the two 
nations to promote bilateral relations including exchanges of 
personnel and goods," Choe said. 
  South Africa finished its first multiracial elections late 
last month and is counting the ballots to form a new government, 
which will formally put an end to apartheid. Nelson Mandela's 
African National Congress had captured more than half of the 
vote after the counting of 32 percent of the ballots. 
  "South Korean businessmen have been reluctant to invest in 
South Africa because there has been a lot of political violence, 
robberies and other crimes in the country. 
  "But crime and political violence may drop considerably 
after 
a democratic government is established and reconciliation 
between blacks and whites is realized," the ambassador said.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  De Klerk, Pioneer -- Considered a "stolid apparatchik" when 
he became leader of the National Party, De Klerk "slowly but 
surely" "led his party to face up to true democracy," notes an 
editorial in the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 3 May on 
page 10. Still a president, about to become a deputy president, 
in making that transition "and in making it the way he did, F. 
W. de Klerk has secured a unique slot in history. He deserves, 
especially at this moment of profound change, tribute for his 
courage." "Most presidents are remembered for the manner of the 
conduct of their presidency. Frederik Willem de Klerk will be 
remembered above all for the manner of the laying down of his 
presidency. His new role as deputy to his erstwhile captive will 
automatically be historic. May it also be blessed with respect 
and distinction." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  New Freedom -- "For Viljoen and the Freedom Front, the 
election result is a double-edged sword," notes an editorial in 
the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 3 May on page 8. 
Although it "will be able to claim that several hundred thousand 
people want a volkstaat [homeland], a closer look at voting 
figures confirms the larger picture which always made the idea 
an impossible dream in a post-apartheid South Africa." The 
Front's "strongest showing is in areas like the Northern, 
Eastern and the Northwestern Transvaal and the [Orange] Free 
State -- areas where the ANC's own support mostly exceeds 75 
percent." The results demonstrate that "volkstaaters exist 
within tiny islands scattered around a multiracial country" and 
the most Viljoen "can expect is that the so-called volkstaat 
council" can be established "as a more or less permanent body" 
that is "charged with looking after the cultural and linguistic 
interests of those Afrikaners who seek that protection." If some 
are dissatisfied with "this limited agenda," a "5 percent 
grouping" "could not make much headway" against a "movement 
representing 60 percent of the population." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Watershed Elections -- While the election bill is "more than 
half the budget expected for housing," and could go higher, "it 
was money well spent," concludes an editorial in Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 3 May on page 8. More good news about the 
way the elections were conducted "is that every party and every 
other commentator is complaining. They must have been, if not 
entirely without hitches, at least quite fair." "We will look 
back at the clumsy birth of democracy with great fondness" and 
"many legends will come from this watershed in our history." 
"The economy of South Africa will not only pick up after the 
elections but we are likely to get fair amounts of investment 
from the rest of the world" as the world's "enthusiasm has been 
sparked by the peaceful way in which these elections were held." 
  Regional Leaders -- Most leaders set to become premiers of 
the regions "are well-known people with good track records," a 
second editorial of the 3 May SOWETAN notes. Toyko Sexwale is a 
"well liked, well respected man who has the image, in more ways 
than one, to lead the most important region in the country" -- 
the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. Popo Molefe, who 
has been "a hard working man and mostly eschewed the glare of 
the spotlight, justly deserves his election to lead the North 
West Region." Matthew Phosa "is amply qualified to head the 
Eastern Transvaal Region, and Terror Lekota is a natural for the 
Free State." "Notwithstanding the fact there is a nagging fear 
of an overblown governance for the future, the leaders will be 
forced to assume a hands-on job with their communities, bringing 
government closer to the people."

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC chief Nelson Mandela by Willi Germund on </F>
28 April; place not given: "We Will Need One, Two, or Perhaps 
Five Years..."] 
  [Text] [Germund] What will be your first decisions as 
president? Do you intend to change the role of the president 
and separate the office from everyday politics? 
  [Mandela] It is hard to list all the changes that we are 
planning to make. We have developed a reconstruction and 
development plan covering a broad sphere in our country's public 
life, including also the president's office and other government 
structures. I will be an executive, managing president and work 
in the framework of a government of national unity. We do not 
want this government to be an empty shell. If we include 
political parties in the government of national unity that get 
more than 5 percent of the votes, they must feel that they are a 
complete, equal part of the decision-making process. 
  [Germund] What type of changes will there be? 
  [Mandela] I do not want to give details at this point, 
because we must be very careful, even if we win an overwhelming 
election victory. We must not create concerns that with our 
majority, we intend to force the minority to accept our policy. 
Any changes must be decided in collective responsibility, 
meaning by agreement of all parties involved. 
  [Germund] That sounds like a formula to paralyze the 
government. If you want to consult the other parties 
comprehensively on any government measure, how are you going to 
make them join in, above all in view of your followers' demands? 
  [Mandela] Can you really ask such a question seriously? We 
have 26 political parties in the country. Thanks to our correct 
policy and strategy, we have been able to keep these parties 
together, and we have made fantastic progress. The new 
transition Constitution has shortcomings because all demands of 
all parties had to be considered. However, we have it, and this 
is our success. We have also achieved agreement with all 
political parties to hold these upcoming elections, without 
making use of our majority. Of course, our followers have the 
right to demand the same opportunities and rights that the 
Whites in South Africa or the people in our neighbor countries 
have. But it will take one, two, or perhaps even five years 
before we can tackle the basic requirements and offer 
employment, jobs, housing, and sanitation. That will take time, 
because we must mobilize the means for this purpose. But once 
the election results have been announced we will start tackling 
these problems. 
  [Germund] Do you believe that the symbols of the old regime 
must be changed? Will a clear cut with the past be necessary? 
  [Mandela] The problem is how to meet the demands of the 
majority, without scaring or intimidating the minorities in this 
country. Despite our conflict in the past -- the Whites have 
skills and means that we do not have. They are of crucial 
importance for our national reconciliation and the development 
of a nation. That is why we are telling the Whites: South 
Africa is your country. The program to change the symbols must 
therefore be started very patiently and seriously, with the 
participation of all parties, as we have done since 1990. 
  [Germund] Do you want to change the name of South Africa 
into 
Azania? 
  [Mandela] I think that is a bit far-fetched. Throughout its 
history, the country was never called Azania. The Arabs at one 
time called a region further north like that. I personally 
cannot warm myself to this idea. I do not think there is a need 
to change the name of South Africa. 
  [Germund] You have basically agreed to a general amnesty for 
members of the security forces. Will there nevertheless be a 
truth commission to clarify the past, and in what way will the 
past be dealt with? 
  [Mandela] The truth commission will not open any type of 
Nuremberg tribunal. South Africa's armed forces, police, 
intelligence services, and administration will play an 
important, if not a crucial, role in this change. Anyone 
demonizing them will render a disservice to South Africa. They 
are of fundamental importance for stability in our 
transformation process. The people who committed crimes in the 
struggle against apartheid have been amnestied. It is therefore 
only fair for the people who committed crimes in the defense of 
apartheid to be amnestied as well. Regarding crimes that were 
committed between October 1990 and December 1993, we think the 
new parliament should decide. We will not amnesty people who 
have committed murders since December. 
  [Germund] Does the public not have a right to know what 
happened? 
  [Mandela] I do not think we should expose people. What 
happened belongs to the past. We must heal the wounds of the 
past. 
  [Germund] So there will be no truth commission? 
  [Mandela] There will be a commission, but the name is not 
important. It is supposed to collect data. 
  [Germund] Does this mean that the police and armed forces 
generals will remain in office? 
  [Mandela] Look, the principle is the same with a general as 
with an ordinary soldier. It applied to our people and will 
also apply to others. 
  [Germund] Are you personally inclined to grant amnesty? 
  [Mandela] I have always said in the election campaign that 
it 
is no use attacking the people of other parties in a way that 
new wounds are created. After all, we want to cooperate in a 
government of national unity. I advocate amnesty. Of course, 
there are the victims' families and relatives, they are very 
bitter. But I personally say, let the past rest. 
  [Germund] What will you be doing with ultrarightists? You 
criticized President Frederik W. de Klerk in the past for 
dealing with them too gently. 
  [Mandela] The National Party at one time represented the 
same 
positions that the ultrarightists hold today. The most 
important weapons are dialogue and criticism, not force. This 
worked prior to the elections when we persuaded General Constand 
Viljoen to take part in the elections and leave the Conservative 
Party. I talked with almost everyone during the past months. I 
talked with every police general. I talked with the whole armed 
forces staff three months ago. I was successful. My most 
important weapon with everyone is dialogue. 
  [Germund] What guarantees can you give that your government 
will act against corruption and will call people personally to 
account? After all, until recently, the ANC had corrupt chiefs 
of government from the Homelands in its own list of candidates. 
  [Mandela] Well, first of all, corruption in the Homelands is 
a mirror of corruption under the governing National Party. We 
know the people were corrupt, but we also know the environs in 
which they worked. However, we will not act in an isolated way. 
We will purge the government. We installed a "Public 
Protector" who will be in charge of publicity and transparency. 
We also installed a commission to investigate human rights 
violations that our organization committed abroad. 
  [Germund] But nothing happened to the responsible people who 
were mentioned in the report. 
  [Mandela] We have the truth commission, which will look at 
the relevant records. However, we must not deal with such 
issues in an isolated manner. We must view all this in the 
political context that is determined by the necessity of 
national unity. We are going to act accordingly.

<F P=106> ["Edited text" of interview with ANC President Nelson </F>
Mandela by Editor Ken Owen, at Mandela's Houghton home in 
Johannesburg on 30 April] 
  [Text] You said at one point that the election has 
been subjected to "massive sabotage". Later you said it was 
"free and fair". Will you now accept the outcome, no matter 
what? 
  [Mandela] Oh, certainly. The IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] has done tremendous work. We gave them a job 
impossible but they have been able to acquit themselves 
admirably. When I say there was massive sabotage, it has nothing 
to do with them. I mean somewhere in the process of 
distribution this sabotage took place. As far as the voting 
among whites, coloured and Indians was concerned, there was 
nothing irregular except in Alberton and one other town. But in 
the African areas, especially the strongholds of the ANC, there 
were serious problems. In the Transkei and the Northern 
Transvaal, ballots were delivered late, but it was not a 
reflection on the IEC itself. They did an impressive job. 
  Stability must surely be your main concern now. What 
threats to stability do you see? 
  [Mandela] Let me first clear up one report that I am going 
to 
raise taxes, that I am going to tax whites. I don't know where 
they picked up that statement. If there is anything I am 
conscious about it is not to frighten the minorities, 
especially the white minority. What I said is that everybody 
must pay a fair tax; secondly we want a low tax rate to attract 
investment, both locally and from abroad. That is what I 
stressed, and I do that in order to achieve stability in our 
country. If you single out a particular community, you are 
creating instability. 
  To establish stability in this country is not a great 
problem. The only people who can create instability are the 
leaders, ourselves. If we are committed to the ideal of a 
government of national unity, which will bring into government 
the leaders of every party, I think we shall be in a position to 
deal with any threat, certainly of violence, that comes. 
  In our economic policies -- the reconstruction and 
development plan, for example -- there is not a single reference 
to things like nationalisation, and this is not accidental. 
There is not a single slogan that will connect us with any 
Marxist ideology. We have drafted this plan five times. It 
emerged from people's forums and we sent it to various people in 
the country -- business people, academics, state corporations, 
government departments -- and the majority of these people 
supported the plan generally, although they had specific 
criticisms. 
  I was present when we had a discussion with Mr Harry 
Oppenheimer and other top businessmen...and we discussed the 
plan very openly, very frankly, and we took down their 
criticisms, and accommodated them. We are now planning a second 
meeting with them because we are concerned that we should put 
before the country a plan which embraces the concerns and the 
fears of all population groups, especially business. I have not 
taken a single extended visit abroad without coming back to 
report to business what I have been doing. 
  What I have done, Ken, is to see heads of states, the heads 
of governments, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, 
commercial banks and industrial organisations to say, we are 
building a new country, we want your assistance with resources. 
We can never get the support of business if we are going to 
have radical policies, and that is why we have put forward this 
perspective of a government of national unity, which may 
consist of De Klerk, and Viljoen, and Zach de Beer, Buthelezi, 
Makwetu, people who don't share at all in radical left policies 
-- with the exception perhaps of the PAC. 
  That is intended to bring about stability so we can face any 
threat to stability. There are people who threaten violence, 
like Inkatha and the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement], but we 
are having discussions with Inkatha, and with the King, and we 
are not going to allow them do things which arise out of the 
fact that there is no contact between the government of national 
unity and Inkatha. We are going to press them to keep within the 
process, and to participate as far as possible. 
  There have been suggestions that Mr. de Klerk will be 
assigned mainly a ceremonial role as deputy president. Is that 
true? 
  [Mandela] No, no, no. He will have the full powers of a 
deputy president except that he will be the second deputy 
president. We have had differences, as you know, but I still 
regard him as a man of integrity who has made a valuable 
contribution. I have hammered him only on one point -- his lack 
of candour as far as the existence of a third force is 
concerned, and allowing our people to be slaughtered. This is 
the only reason I have clashed with him. 
  Otherwise, I value his contribution and I think it will be 
proper for a government of national unity to recognise that 
contribution if he gets five percent and if he comes in as the 
second strongest party. He certainly will be useful because he 
has had experience of government. Although his government was 
illegitimate and discredited, he has had experience. 
  As we understand his position, if he gets four or five 
seats in cabinet he would want one cabinet seat in each of three 
categories -- security, finance, and social. Are you happy with 
that formula? 
  [Mandela] I have not heard that rumour, but I have said that 
I am interested in stability in this country and it is going to 
be necessary for us to ensure this stability by the cabinet 
appointments we make, but I have not yet discussed these matters 
with my organisation. 
  Would you keep Dr. Stals at the Reserve Bank? 
  [Mandela] I would recommend that. 
  What about amnesty? Will an extended amnesty be 
secret? Will we never know who committed what crimes? 
  [Mandela] You know that opponents of apartheid were granted 
indemnity provided they made applications, and disclosed the 
crimes for which they were applying. The question is whether 
the security forces must get the same treatment. We want the 
support of the security forces, the police and the army, but 
their morale is very low. They are concerned about the 
commission for truth, that it will lead to a kind of Nuremburg 
trials. 
  The ANC must take the lead in removing the lack of morale. 
We will depend on the SAP [South African Police] and we must 
remember that there are 100,000 policemen. Only a small number 
of them are guilty of these kinds of crimes. That is why we are 
looking at an amnesty after disclosure. Of course, there will 
be no amnesty for crimes committed after December 1993. 
  After stability, when things settle down, you will have 
to deal with expectations. What are your three top 
priorities? 
  [Mandela] We have spelled out our priorities: the creation 
of 2.5-million jobs, the building of one million homes, free and 
universal education. These are the central issues, in that 
order, but this does not mean that we will ignore other needs. 
There is, naturally, also the question of peace. 
  Will you disarm the nation? 
  [Mandela] That is absolutely imperative. We must devise a 
strategy of gun control and community policing. Then you must 
understand also that the enemies of peace are poverty, lack of 
jobs, homelessness, illiteracy. We must attack these, and get 
the community involved in the process of controlling the 
violence in the country -- because the fact that the masses are 
not involved helps to aggravate the position. 
  The election has been an extraordinary emotional event 
as well as a political event. The election was in itself an act 
of conciliation. How do you build on that? 
  [Mandela] The question of conciliation is one of the most 
important. This message must go across very clearly, and I hope 
that every leader will realise how important it is for us not 
only to preach but to take some concrete steps to ensure 
reconciliation. 
  The question of indemnity, for example, is part of that 
conciliation. the fact that we have avoided targeting any 
community, even the white community, is an attempt to avoid 
creating fear or concern which may induce our people to leave 
the country. Whatever criticism we have of the policy of racial 
discrimination, the reality is that the whites in this country 
have had opportunities which we have not had -- opportunities of 
education, of acquiring knowledge, skill and expertise -- and in 
the building of a new South Africa we are going to rely on them. 
Their contribution will be critical. 
  That is why we are calling on whites to accept that the 
victory we have achieved is not just a victory of the oppressed, 
it is a victory of the entire people of South Africa. Even 
those that have left the country, we would like them to come 
back, and show them that in everything that we do we place 
importance on consultation with all national groups. 
  That is why I can today go to any big business group in this 
country and ask for support, and I do not come away without 
support.

<F P=106> [Interview with ANC President Nelson Mandela by editor </F>
Aggrey Klaaste and political editor Mathatha Tsedu at the 
Carlton Hotel in Johannesburg on 1 May;] 
  [Text] Question: What practical steps will be taken 
by the new government to implement the Restoration and 
Development Programme [RDP]. 
  [Mandela] Firstly, we must bear in mind that the RDP is a 
product done in consultation with the people in the People's 
Forum. That RDP was drafted five times, the first time through 
consultation with the people. It was then circulated widely to 
opinion-makers for major comments. Every time we got these 
comments we recirculated it. We also had a meeting with people 
like Mr Harry Oppenheimer and other top businessmen to give 
final touches to the plan. We are meeting them again next week 
to ensure that this RDP contains the views and aspirations of a 
wide range of opinion- makers. 
  Now we know the high expectations of our people and these 
have to be respected and met. They can see their counterparts 
in this country and in neighbouring states enjoying 
opportunities which have been denied them. They are justified 
in those expectations. Our duty as a leadership is to say they 
must not expect miracles and that to address their basic needs 
is going to require a year or even as much as five years. 
  After the election results have been announced the process 
of 
involving the masses of the people in addressing their basic 
needs will start. The significance of the Peoples' Forum is 
that it is the people who are telling us what they want. This 
is the mechanism used to apply the RDP, not only generally as in 
the case of houses and jobs, but in particular instances. This 
is important because we will also be having a government of 
national unity. Those involved must feel they are not just 
rubber-stamping what the majority party decides. It is 
important to build mutual trust among various South Africans to 
build the nation. 
  How will you avoid isolation from the people who voted 
you into power? Where will you be staying? Places like Groote 
Schuur and Libertas not only have Afrikaans names but are 
associated with apartheid. Might you change names or have 
symbolic residences in black townships? 
  [Mandela] It is not so much the place where you stay as the 
commitment. I have been to all the people's townships rather 
than the suburbs. There is hardly any place during the 
elections that I have not visited with my road show. It is 
significant that leaders should live in a style which is not 
very different from the masses of the people. I would have 
preferred to stay in the house that I own and travel to Pretoria 
and Cape Town. But there is security to be considered. 
  A president is not only a president of Africans, Coloureds 
and Indians, but a president of whites as well and they expect 
certain standards. We must consider the feelings of the 
minorities as well. Our quarrels of the past must be buried. 
The question of names will have to be addressed very seriously. 
Historical places in this country must reflect the population 
mix, and the role that has been played by the entire population. 
It has to be done. But with great care, through consensus. We 
have in the last few months of negotiations shifted people from 
their old positions to ones where they now collaborate with us 
to build. Also we must tell them you can't have the Jan Smuts 
Airport, Hendrik Verwoerd Airport and D.F. Malan Airport. We 
cannot have that. They must reflect the role played by all 
communities. 
  The peace we have had through the elections may be 
followed by some violence as already shown in some parts of 
Natal. What contingency plans do you have to maintain the 
peace? 
  [Mandela] Our strategy is twofold. There is the political 
initiative and the security initiative. We have discussed this 
with the Inkatha Freedom Party. I had a four-hour meeting with 
the king alone and various discussions with Mr Buthelezi. I 
told the king about the killings in Ulundi and he was shocked, 
for he'd heard from me for the first time about these events as 
he had just returned from Swaziland. He was very responsive. 
That is the political initiative. We have taken another 
initiative on the security side and deployed the army and the 
South African Police. With all the criticism the security 
forces have done well. They have brought down the level of 
violence in that province. 
  I am in constant touch with Mr de Klerk, Kobie Coetzee, the 
Minister of Defence, and General van der Merwe the Commissioner 
of Police. I am satisfied that the security forces are doing 
very well. The crux of the matter is we should develop 
community policing, where the police will have credibility and 
legitimacy. We must also make sure that the police and defence 
forces reflect the population mix. Not only in the lower ranks. 
We must push people of all race groups right up to the command 
structures. 
  What is your attitude towards freedom of the Press? 
  [Mandela] The Press is one of the most important pillars of 
democracy. There can be no democracy without a free, vigorous 
and fearless Press. It is a mirror in which public figures must 
see themselves and without that it will be very difficult to 
ensure that public figures are going to behave as they are 
expected to. 
  We will go all-out to ensure that this freedom is 
entrenched. 
The Press is a very important cornerstone of democracy. 
  What exact offer are you going to make to the right 
wing? 
  [Mandela] We are having discussions with Viljoen and you 
know he has stated more than twice that the Afrikaner Volksfront 
[National Front], and now the Freedom Front, has found more 
sincerity and made greater progress with the ANC than with the 
National Party. That is because we have engaged them in 
discussion and you must not forget what I have been emphasising. 
The National Party was once in the same position as the right 
wing. Through discussion we have broken down all their 
superstitions. 
  I have seen General Constand Viljoen several times. I have 
seen Ferdi Hartzenberg twice I have asked for a one-on-one with 
him. I have asked him to bring his leadership to meet my 
leadership. He has refused. Flatly. I said he sounded like 
Hernus Kriel. He said he was worse than Kriel, who could at 
least consider what I was saying. But they have become 
isolated. He will soon realise that he either talks to us or 
disappears into the wilderness. 
  We will continue speaking to all leaders, including the 
right 
wing. We don't think they pose a threat. They will always 
remain a police matter. We should not make them too important 
by banning them. Our agreement with the right wing is the idea 
of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] will be examined after the 
election. In our country no minority will determine what is 
going to happen to any party of the country. Their demands will 
be listened to, but if they dare to overstep the constitutional 
mark, we will deal with them firmly. 
  As far as the question of the volkstaat is concerned, it is 
not one to be dealt with by a particular group but by the entire 
population of South Africa. The right wing is also a minority 
within a minority. We have fought and defeated the bantustan 
policy and by accepting the volkstaat we would then be negating 
the work we have done over decades. 
  When Tambo died you asked for a moment alone with his 
body. What was going on in your mind? 
  [Mandela] Oliver Tambo was an outstanding leader. A 
scientist, a teacher, a lawyer and a musician and a politician 
and statesman. We had grown up together. We were at varsity 
[university] together. We had a partnership. He did a 
remarkable job of keeping our organisation together, and put it 
to this great level. When I voted for the first time in my life 
I had mixed feelings. Joy and sadness that outstanding leaders 
like Chris Hani, Robert Sobukwe and Steve Biko and many others 
were not there to share it with us. 
  Will you offer the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] 
anything in the cabinet? 
  [Mandela] It is painful that the PAC has not shown strength 
in this election, because these are men and women who have 
suffered as much as we have. I was with them in prison. We 
struggled together. The proper thing to do would be to find 
some role for them in government. As an individual, I will 
continue to make sure that those in other political 
organisations who were in the liberation movement are 
accommodated. Not only the PAC but AZAPO [Azanian People's 
Organization] as well. 
  AZAPO and the PAC have outstanding leaders whose 
contribution 
has been great. As an individual I have not ruled out the 
possibility that in one way or another we will give them a place. 
  There will be two deputy presidents and Mr. de Klerk 
will be the second. Who is your first choice? 
  [Mandela] That is a decision that I will have to make. It 
is a matter I will announce at the right moment. It will be a 
question of ability pure and simple. The first deputy president 
will play a prime minister's role and the State President is 
going to rely very heavily on him on government matters. He 
must be a person who can liaise with leaders of other political 
organisations. 
  Business was once very hostile to the ANC but that 
perception 
has changed. But we are concerned to deal with the fears of 
minorities, especially the whites, as we require their skills. 
We will not compromise on the basic needs of our people, 
joblessness, homelessness, education, running water and 
electricity. 
  We must remember we must get the support of the minorities 
and we should not accentuate the feelings of insecurity. 
  What about the rest of Africa? 
  [Mandela] We owe all the African leaders a great deal. We 
must take Africa historically. The problems come from the 
colonial era. The colonisers never tried to develop Africa. 
They wanted raw material and routes to the harbours and to 
resell them at exorbitant prices. The economic problems date 
from that background. If you consider that, then Africa has 
done well. The Organisation of African Unity has played a 
tremendous role in bringing about our freedom. They have given 
us courage and resources. Even now the OAU is poor because it 
has given us support. I have collected no less than 66 million 
American dollars from them.

<F P=106> [Address by State President F.W. de Klerk at National Party </F>
headquarters in Linwood, Pretoria; italicized passages in 
Afrikaans -- live] 
  [Text] Colleagues, candidates, fellow Nationalists, fellow 
South Africans. Four years and three months ago, I said in 
parliament that the time has come for us to break out of the 
cycle of conflict, tension, and violent struggle in which we 
have been embroiled for decades. I said that the table had been 
laid for sensible leaders to begin talking about a new 
dispensation and to reach an understanding by way of dialogue 
and negotiation. I said that the agenda would include a new and 
dynamic constitution, the removal of any form of discrimination 
and domination, equality before an independent judiciary, the 
protection of minorities as well as of individual rights, 
freedom of religion, and universal franchise. 
  During the past week, we have seen the realization of that 
vision. We have a new and dynamic constitution. We have the 
assurance that there will be no domination of any South Africans 
by any others. We have seen the end of discrimination. We have 
equality before the law. Minority rights have been secured. 
Individual rights and all these other rights are guaranteed by a 
charter of fundamental rights and by a strong and effective 
constitutional court, and during the past week we have held our 
first universal franchise election. After so many centuries we 
will finally have a government which represents all South 
Africans. After so many centuries all South Africans are now 
free. [applause] 
  This new election did not take place without problems. 
We had serious hitches, shortcomings, and irregularities. Hard 
work is taking place to deal with these problems within the 
framework of the law, and the necessary steps will be taken. 
Despite all these problems, there can, however, be no doubt 
that the ANC has received the most votes countrywide and the 
National Party, the second most votes. The National Party [NP] 
will ensure during the ratification process that it and other 
parties get everything they have a legal right to, and that 
errors will be corrected as far as possible. This must happen 
quickly. South Africans are impatient. The new parliament, the 
government, and regional governments must be put together now. 
We must move ahead in this country. 
  Despite all these problems, a word of thanks is in 
order. Many people worked hard to make the election possible. 
They had little time, and many changes took place during the 
process, such as the double ballot and the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's entry to the election. I also wish to express my thanks 
to Judge Johann Kriegler and the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] for their hard work. The fact that we had 
serious criticism does not in any way detract from our 
appreciation. To the Air Force too, which in the end had to 
jump in to lend a hand, also a word of thanks. Thank you also 
to the security forces, and in particular the South African 
Police, for their contribution to a peaceful election. And 
especially to the voters, in particular those who supported the 
NP. We will not disappoint you. 
  While we concede that another party gained the most 
votes, the NP says: Our second place is not a defeat; it is a 
victory for the cause we stand for. [applause] The 
spirit among the voters during the election was a revelation, a 
revelation that we must never forget. There was tolerance, 
patience, excitement, and a visible desire for reconciliation 
and peace. Our people want the new South Africa to work, the 
election to succeed, the bitterness of the past to be put aside. 
This attitude must serve as a guideline, to all leaders in the 
years ahead, of what the people of South Africa expect of 
them. 
  I also said four years ago that Mr. Nelson Mandela would 
play 
an important role, and then noted that he had declared himself 
willing to make a constructive contribution to the peaceful 
political process in South Africa. During the past four years 
Mr. Mandela has played such a role. His role was a leading and 
an honorable one. I thank him, and I congratulate him. He 
deserves the congratulations, good wishes, and prayers of all 
South Africans. I look forward to working with him 
constructively within the government of national unity in our 
common effort to promote the well-being of all our people. 
  During the past four years we have proved that we can work 
together. Despite our differences, our relationship has become a 
symbol of the ability of South Africans from widely different 
backgrounds to cooperate in the national interest. This spirit 
will be essential to the success of the government of national 
unity. 
  He will soon assume the highest office in the land with all 
the awesome responsibility which it bears. He will have to 
exercise this great responsibility in a balanced manner which 
will assure South Africans from all our communities that he has 
all their interests at heart. I am confident that that will be 
his intention. Mr. Mandela has walked a long road and now stands 
at the top of the hill. A traveler would sit down and admire 
the view, but a man of destiny knows that beyond this hill lies 
another, and another. The journey is never complete. As he 
contemplates the next hill, I hold out my hand to Mr. Mandela in 
friendship and in cooperation. As far as my own position is 
concerned, I should like to make it clear that I believe that my 
political task is just beginning. Everything that we have done 
so far -- the four years of difficult and often frustrating 
negotiations, the problems and the crises -- have been simply a 
preparation for the work that lies ahead. [applause] 
  The greatest challenge...the greatest challenge which we 
will 
face in the government of national unity will be to defend and 
nurture our new constitution. Our greatest task will be to 
ensure that our young and vulnerable democracy takes root and 
flourishes. We must make the transitional constitution a living 
organism. We must remain vigilant against any attempts by any 
level of government to erode any aspect of the constitution or 
of individual minority or religious rights. Our courts must 
build up a sound basis of case law which will provide further 
guarantees for the maintenance of constitutional rights. We 
must rally all the genuinely democratic institutions of our 
society in a grand coalition for the defense of the constitution 
and its principles. We must also ensure that we adopt the right 
approaches in the economic and social spheres. We need a strong 
and a vibrant economy based on tried and tested principles of 
free enterprise. Only then can we ensure that we will generate 
the wealth which we need to address the pressing social needs of 
large sections of our population. We must ensure that social 
services are affordable, caring, and effective. 
  We must also continue to observe our values, good 
family values, the moral values befitting a country based on 
Christian norms and standards. 
  I will be in a good position in the government of national 
unity to promote these objectives. I will not be there at the 
whim of any person or any party, but in my own right as the 
leader of the National Party, as the representative of many 
millions of South Africans who have put their trust in us and 
who have supported our policies and our principles. [applause] 
Just as we could not rule South Africa effectively without the 
support of the ANC and its supporters, no government will be 
able to rule South Africa effectively without the support of the 
people and the institutions that I as your leader in the 
National Party represent. I enthusiastically pledge that 
support in the interests of working for national reconciliation 
and reconstruction. 
  Our party is in a good position to make a key 
contribution in this regard. The changes that have taken place 
within the National Party over the past few years are nothing 
short of a miracle. This fact will be proven in the expected 
election results. Although we are not the biggest party at 
present, there can be little doubt that our party is the most 
representative party of all our population groups. This is a 
solid foundation for the future and for future growth. 
  I wish all in our party, my fellow leaders, our workers 
who worked so hard in this election, all our supporters, good 
luck with our performance in the election. Thank you for the 
graciousness you showed in making possible the changes we have 
introduced. Thank you for your hard work and sacrifice, faith, 
and support, and loyalty. It is that which we will be able to 
build upon. 
  We in our party represent to a certain extent the nucleus of 
our new nation. Within our party we have already achieved the 
reconciliation which South Africa as a whole needs. We believe 
that we have the recipe for the future, and we plan to spread 
our message and win further support, until one day we shall be 
the largest party in the country. [applause] Our objective will 
be to prove this already at the polls in five years' time. 
  I know there are those who are skeptical towards the 
new dispensation, and there are also those who even want to 
oppose it violently. If for them it involves religious freedom, 
language, cultural rights, or individual rights, or community 
rights, then I say to them tonight, we must stand together, 
because we in this party will also fight for those rights. If 
they are concerned about self-determination in a practically 
achievable manner without ever again bringing back any form of 
discrimination on a single inch of land in South Africa, then I 
say, we will support that. But if it involves racism and 
unachievable dreams, then they are on the wrong path, and then 
there will be no peace. Then it will be a useless course, and I 
ask them tonight: Become part of the solution. The election 
has shown once and for all that those minorities which want to 
force solutions on their fellow South Africans are heading 
toward a dead end. 
  I should also like to use this opportunity to thank all 
those 
who have helped South Africa, to bring South Africa to this new 
era. The list is very long. It includes our negotiators, the 
cabinet, officials, the security forces who have helped to keep 
the process on track. It includes foreign leaders who have 
given us so much support. It includes you, the supporters of my 
party. It includes thousands of ordinary people who have 
remembered us in their prayers. 
  Most importantly, on a very personal note, I must thank my 
wife, Marike, and my family. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, this is an important milestone in the 
history of our country, perhaps the most important that we will 
ever see. Next Tuesday I shall lay down my responsibilities as 
state president, secure in the knowledge that we have achieved 
what we set out to achieve four years and three months ago. I 
shall be handing over the presidency to Mr. Mandela, but I shall 
not be leaving government. I shall be surrendering power not to 
the majority of the moment, but to the South African people. I 
shall do so with the strong conviction that henceforth 
sovereignty will ultimately lie with them and in the 
constitution. A power greater than man has given South Africa 
the spirit, the chance to go forward in peace. God Almighty has 
been kind to us. Now it is up to the political leaders to join 
together, to work together, for the good of our people, and to 
complete the task of healing and reconciliation. God bless 
South Africa. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika [God Bless Africa]. Thank 
you. [applause]

  [Text] Durban May 2 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he telephoned African National 
Congress President Nelson Mandela on Monday [2 May] evening to 
congratulate him on the ANC victory in the National Assembly in 
South Africa's first all-race election. Mr Mandela referred in 
his victory speech in Johannesburg on Monday night to telephone 
calls from National Party leader President F W de Klerk, Freedom 
Front leader Gen Constand Viljoen and the Pan Africanist 
Congress leadership, in which they pledged their support. 
  He made no reference to the IFP leader and speculation began 
immediately on radio stations as to what this meant. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he telephoned Mr Mandela at 5.45PM on 
Monday.

  [Text] African National Congress Premier-elect for the 
Eastern Transvaal Region Mr Matthews Phosa has unveiled a 
six-point plan on how he intends to run the area. Phosa also 
told SOWETAN in an interview that urgent steps needed to be 
taken in "order to avoid money being misused by people who are 
presently in state offices". 
  He said his plan would be to: 

  -  Immediately put in place strict monitoring of government 
and administration in KwaNdebele, KaNgwane and the Transvaal 
Province Administration; 
  -  Decentralisation of power; 
  -  Kick-start all the structures of state so that they should 
function in a cohesive manner; 
  -  Finalise the policy position of all 29 regional structures; 
  -  Start reconstruction and development; 
  -  Identify the needs of the people and immediately begin to 
deliver and; 
  -  Management of the expectations of the people must be 
people-driven. People should know what is happening so that if 
there is a delay in fulfilling their needs, they would be in the 
know. 

    Phosa said: "Government must develop a culture of 
communication because this will help to solve problems that 
might arise. 
  "The people of South Africa have managed to liberate 
themselves and this they did by communicating their aspirations 
through the ballot box," said Phosa.

  [Text] Popo Molefe is the premier candidate on the ANC's 
list for the North West Province. Let's find out more about him. 
  Popo Molefe, well known for his days as general secretary of 
the United Democratic Front, is now a member of the ANC's 
National Executive Committee. Born in Sophiatown in 1952 to a 
farm laborer and a domestic worker, Molefe was looked after by 
his aunt, but he was harassed by white children when visiting 
her in the white suburb where she worked. Molefe, who went to 
school in Soweto was convinced by his experiences of racism as a 
child to become involved in the Black Consciousness political 
movement. Active in political organizations from 1973, he was 
involved in planning the well-known 16 June march in 1976, for 
which he spent seven months in detention. 
  Molefe noticed that many white people were sympathetic to 
the 
students cause and that it was black policemen, as well as 
white, who were using brutal force against the students. He 
realized that his views of South African conflict, simply being 
between black and white, did not hold. By 1981 Molefe had 
become involved in the community organizations like Motlana 
Soweto Committee of ten and was committed to the principle of 
nonracialism. He was later to participate in the formation of 
the United Democratic Front, playing a prominent role as the 
organization's general secretary and being instrumental in their 
campaign against the tricameral parliament. 
  In 1985, Molefe, along with 22 others, was charged with 
treason, relating to the disturbances in the Vaal Triangle the 
previous year. During the three-year trial, which became known 
worldwide as the Delmas trial, the accused were denied bail. 
Molefe and four others were convicted of treason and given 
10-year sentences. Molefe was to spend the rest of that decade 
imprisoned on Robben Island. He was there even when his fellow 
prisoners, like Walter Sisulu, convicted under charges similar 
to his in the mammoth Rivonia trial, were released. 
  In December of 1989 the appeal court quashed all convictions 
and Molefe and his co-accused were released from prison. They 
were greeted by jubilant supporters who were welcoming back 
their leaders in a time when the country was on the verge of 
change. Molefe immediately returned to working in political 
organizations and was elected to the ANC's National Executive 
Committee at its first congress in 1991. Molefe, who was 
appointed to the crucial job of heading the ANC's elections 
department, is the 16th candidate on their election list.

<F P=106> [Interview with Northern Cape Premier-elect Manne Dipico by </F>
correspondent Charl Pauw on 2 May; place not given--recorded, in 
English; italicized passage in Afrikaans] 
  [Text] The premier designate for the Northern Cape, 
where the ANC currently has a lead of 11 percent, discussed the 
possibility of cooperation with other parties in the future. 
Charl Pauw spoke to Mr. Manne Dipico. 
  [Begin recording] [Dipico] There is no party that is going 
to 
dominate, and to us it is really a blessing. Other people are 
not happy about it, others will be happy; but to me I see it as 
a positive step because it will force all other parties, compel 
us to speak to one another, to bring us into a coalition; and we 
believe that through negotiations the Freedom Front and the 
National Party will have to come up with a system which can take 
this province forward. 
  [Pauw] So these are in fact the kind of people you are 
looking toward to bring into this coalition? 
  [Dipico] These are the kind of people who we are going to 
bring into the coalition, Freedom Front. We are going to start 
discussing earnestly with the National Party and even the DP 
[Democratic Party], which also could maybe get a seat. 
  [Pauw] It was always said, and you said it yourself, that 
the 
Colored voters will determine who's going to win here, but that 
somehow hasn't materialized. 
  [Dipico] Yes, it's true. What really happened because our 
people in our province understood the message of the National 
Party, others understood the message of the ANC, and to that 
extent, the Colored vote -- when we look at it -- was really a 
split between these two parties and that really determined the 
destiny. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Election `94" program] </F>
  [Text] The ANC's Patrick Lekota, nicknamed Terror on the 
school soccer field, was born in Kroonstad in 1948. He grew up 
in this house as the son of a domestic worker and truck driver, 
herding cattle and walking 14 miles a day to and from his farm 
school. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] Although, of course, as early as 
time, especially the late 50's, I began to notice the relations 
between black and white and the whippings that took place of 
farm workers -- and things like that began to make an impression 
me. [end recording] 
  He was unable to finish his social science degree at the 
University of the North after being expelled for his involvement 
in the SRC [Students Representative Council]. At this stage 
Lekota was heavily influenced by his tutor, Steve Biko, and 
involved in the Black Consciousness Movement -- but meeting the 
then banned Beyers Naude left a great impression. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] I was really moved by the fact that 
there was indeed a white man who was giving the rest of his life 
fighting this thing. He had become a reject among his people. 
It didn't change me immediately, but it was something that 
stayed with me. I faced tremendous problems the following years 
in terms of moving me from black consciousness to nonracial 
politics. [end recording] 
  Although Terror was arrested under the Terrorism Act in 1974 
and sentenced to 10 years on Robben Island, he valued his 
experience there. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] One of the most important events 
for 
me was meeting the leadership of the ANC for the first time on 
Robben Island. I had come from a background in which their 
names had featured significantly but never really in a situatio 
in which one could learn intensively. [end recording] 
  But there were bad times in Robben Island as well. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] I think that is was the most 
difficult blow for me -- was when I lost my brother when I was 
in jail and I was unable to come out and come and bury him. I 
thought really at that time that I deserved to be released to 
bury him, I was only on trial after all. I was not a serving 
prisoner and also I must say that in 1975 I got married in 
Pretoria Prison. Again you know at that time I thought the 
state could have released me. [end recording] 
  By the time Terror was released eight years later he was to 
play a prominent role in the UDF [United Democratic Front], 
leading towards his arrest and conviction in the Delmas Treason 
Trial. When the appeal court quashed all convictions he 
returned to work in t!?? UDF [United Democratic Front], and 
later the ANC. 
  [Begin Lekota recording] Well, if it is not some physical 
exercise one way or the other, I love to play scrabble. I like 
to watch soccer, boxing, rugby, and more recently cricket. [end 
recording] 
  Terror, who helped launch and rebuild the ANC in the Orange 
Free State, is the party's candidate for premier in that region.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth May 2 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress overcame all opposition with a crushing victory Monday 
[2 May] in the Eastern Cape, south of the Kei River, in South 
Africa's first democratic election. Port Elizabeth, the largest 
urban centre in the sub-region with an estimated voter 
population of 470,000, closed the counting. The ANC swept the 
boards with 252,531 of the votes for the National Assembly. 
  Its closest challenger, the National Party [NP], won 130,085 
votes. 
  The total number of votes cast was 416,395, electoral 
officials announced at 10.30PM. Rejected ballots numbered 
2,928. After the NP, the ANC's opponents lagged far behind: 
the Democratic Party [DP] with 13,867 votes, the Freedom Front 
with 4,757 and the Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] with just 4,119. 
  The scenario was similar for the provincial legislature. The 
ANC scored 246,732 votes against the NP's 115,841 out of a total 
412,133 ballots cast. The DP moved upwards to 29,991, as did 
the rightwing front with 5,923 votes. The PAC dipped slightly 
to 4,101. 
  In neighbouring Uitenhage where the white and coloured vote 
niggled the ANC, Nelson Mandela's party also scored an easy win 
with 66,066 out of the 103,002 votes cast for the National 
Assembly, against the NP's 31,284 and the Freedom Front's 2,494. 
  Across the broader Eastern Cape and Kei region, the NP 
threat 
lessened throughout the day. The party dropped from 19.3 per 
cent in the morning to 10.7 per cent by 11PM Monday compared 
with 82.6 per cent for the ANC. The DP's support climbed slowly 
from 2.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent. Ironically the PAC and 
Freedom Front recorded similar percentages of just under two per 
cent. The African Christian Democratic Party, which some 
expected would gain a credible showing in the region, pegged 
below one percentage point. 
  Counting was smooth throughout the sub-region except for 
Port 
Elizabeth where ballot box disputes resulted in stoppages. A 
criminal investigation is pending over 30 ballot boxes from the 
sprawling township of KwaZakele which police allege were 
tampered with by Independent Electoral Commission officials. 
  Eastern Cape Attorney-General [AG] Les Roberts is to decide 
whether a prosecution on the charge of electoral fraud is 
feasible. The IEC and police have conducted separate inquiries 
into the alleged tampering. 
  Agreement was reached early Monday evening between political 
party agents and the IEC to count the 30,000-odd KwaZakhele 
votes. With the mandate of the AG, the votes are excluded from 
the final tally, are listed separately as "disputed" and will be 
stored in an isolated container until the dispute is settled. 
The NP's formal request for the votes to be declared invalid 
must also still be decided on by the commission. 
  A second complaint by the NP -- over the way ballots were 
compressed in another 24 ballot boxes from KwaZakhele -- was 
resolved after a lengthy meeting on Monday when all the parties 
accepted there had been no fraudulent tampering with the votes. 
IEC officials said no abnormal trends were spotted with the 
KwaZakhele votes at counting time. 
  Neither the premier candidate for the ANC nor NP was in the 
region on Monday. Robben Island veteran Ray Mhlaba was at his 
party's headquarters in Johannesburg. Dr Tertius Delport, the 
former local government minister, flew to Pretoria for a meeting 
with F W de Klerk.

  [Text] Port Elizabeth SAPA May 2 -- The 30,000-odd votes 
disputed in Port Elizabeth's KwaZakhele township would be 
counted but not included in the final tally for the Eastern Cape 
metropole, political parties and electoral officials agreed on 
Monday [2 May] evening. 
  A criminal investigation of electoral fraud is under way 
after police alleged Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) 
officials had tampered with the ballot on the second day of 
voting last week. The claim is that 30 of the boxes were 
improperly sealed or hinged. The docket must still be forwarded 
to the attorney-general. The IEC has not conceded that 
tampering occurred. 
  The IEC and all political parties announced in a joint 
statement that one ballot box was no longer in dispute, after it 
was examined in their presence and monitored by foreign 
observers. 
  The result for Port Elizabeth is expected within the hour. 
The KwaZakhele votes would be recorded separately and the 
ballot would be stored in an isolated area until the IEC had 
reached a decision. 
  IEC official Rob Midgley said he could not comment on how 
soon the IEC's final determination would take but said: "This 
will be done as soon as possible." 
  The National Party [NP] has formally requested the IEC 
declare the KwaZakhele vote invalid. The joint statement 
confirms the NP's "formal complaint" will be forwarded to the 
commission for final determination. 
  IEC officials and party agents were locked in a meeting all 
day to settle the dispute on the KwaZakhele ballot boxes. 
Counting of the KwaZakhele votes haz now started.

  [Text] Durban May 2 SAPA -- Vote counting pressed ahead in 
KwaZulu/Natal on Monday afternoon behind schedule, amid 
predictions that a final tally could be delivered by Tuesday 
afternoon. 
  Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) Spokesman Glenn 
McDougall said staffers from counting stations which had 
completed their tally would be moved to slower stations to beef 
the process up. 
  He said Durban was among the slowest stations, because of 
its 
late start after a labour dispute on Saturday. By late 
afternoon, over 600,000 votes had been counted in KwaZulu-Natal, 
but this represented only about 12 per cent of the total ballot. 
At this stage the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] led the electoral 
race with 53 per cent. 
  But the African National Congress was still confident of a 
victory in the province, saying support would swing in the 
party's favour as counting drew to a close. The ANC had 30.7 
per cent at the time. Spokesman Themba Rubushe said he was 
confident the ANC would gain more than 50 per cent of the vote. 
"We expect to come back comfortably." 
  IFP Spokesman Peter Smith said it was still too early to 
predict the outcome of elections in the province, with a 
relatively small percentage of the regional vote counted. 
  Meanwhile, the counting process in Natal was labelled as 
"chaotic", by the National Party's [NP] Natal InFormation 
Chairman Renier Schoeman. "It's thumb suck. In KwaZulu/Natal 
there is an endless irritation about the way (counting) has been 
handled. This is gross inefficiency." He said the current 
figures were "mickey mouse" and did not reflect even remotely 
what his party would achieve when counting was completed. At 
the time the NP enjoyed just over nine per cent support in the 
province. 
  The Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC], which emerged with two 
per 
cent of the provisional results on Monday afternoon, boasted it 
would win as much as five per cent support in KwaZulu/Natal. 
Spokeswoman Siphiwe Sithole said the PAC -- not recognised as 
much of a contender in the regional race -- had benefited from 
rural support because of its land policies. 
  The PAC was on Monday afternoon ahead of the Democratic 
Party 
[DP], which was largely expected to pick up good support in this 
historically progressive province. But it had 1.7 per cent on 
Monday afternoon. 
  Following the DP in sixth position in KwaZulu/Natal was the 
Freedom Front with 1.1 per cent.

  [Text] Durban May 3 SAPA -- Counting at most stations in 
KwaZulu/Natal had been completed by Tuesday [3 May] morning and 
results of the elections were being compiled, Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] spokesman Glenn McDougall said. At 
Durban's Expo Centre, where a third of the province's votes are 
being counted, six of 28 stations were still counting. In 
Pietermaritzburg and Port Shepstone, counting had been completed 
by 9.30AM. 
  In Empangeni on the North Coast counting was still 
progressing, said Mr McDougall. There had been minor disputes at 
some stations in the region. 
  In nearby Eshowe all ballot slips in undisputed boxes had 
been counted. Disputes about the remainder were being resolved 
on Tuesday morning. 
  Mr McDougal estimated counting in the province would be 
completed by late Tuesday afternoon. 
  Political parties have estimated there were between 4.5 and 
6 
million eligible voters in the province.

  [Text] East London May 2 SAPA -- Ballot papers had been 
stacked by hand in some ballot boxes in the Ciskei, a National 
Party [NP] spokesman said on Monday [2 May]. 
  Regional candidate Mr Billy Nel said in a statement that the 
seals of the boxes could not have been there at the time of 
voting, or else were removed afterwards for this to be done. 
"This practice was found to be done at ballot boxes at counting 
stations at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital and Manpower Centre." 
  He said the sealing of boxes was "totally unacceptable". 
Mdantsane counting stations were a total fiasco. Plastic cable 
ties were used, or plastic tape, instead of the official seals 
from the presiding officer and the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission]. 
  The counting procedures were rushed and the result had been 
seen as more important that the system or security. There was 
no security at the counting stations and people could come and 
go at leisure. 
  United Nations observers had been absent from the majority 
of 
polling stations in the Transkei. "The NP is extremely unhappy 
with the execution of voting procedures from the Transkei and 
Ciskei and also the intimidation that took place during the 
election. The result produced in these areas were anticipated 
by the National Party. But the margin of error is totally 
unacceptable to us." 
  The NP hoped it would not be forced to accept all the 
results 
without a proper investigation, or a heavy-handed attitude 
towards these problems from the ANC.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 2 SAPA -- Five IEC [Indepent 
Electoral Commission] officials, three of them seconded by the 
Department of Home Affairs, are being investigated for the 
concealment of large quantities of ballot papers and other 
materials at the height a shortage crisis during the election. 
  Peter Harris, Chief Director of IEC monitoring, told 
reporters on Tuesday night that cases had been refered to the 
attorney general and the Goldstone Commission as a result of 
investigations into irregularities. 
  One official was under investigation for, as he put it, 
gross 
dereliction of duty at best. He was in charge of 611 boxes 
containing 5,499,000 ballot slips at Marievale. 
  He had been giving conflicting counts of his available 
material, turning away electoral officers before a team of 
specialist functions monitors entered his warehouse on the 
morning of April 28 when the missing stock was discovered. The 
searchers were accompanied by nine SAP [South African Police] 
officers. 
  In Pretoria another warehousing facility was found to 
contain 
150 boxes (of 9,000 each) PWV 
[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] ballots, 100 boxes of 
Western Cape, 30 of Northern Cape, 10 national, 300 OFS [Orange 
Fre State] and 10 North West. There were also 100 boxes of IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers, 200 UV lights and four boxes 
of ink. 
  Mr Harris confirmed that an investiation was also in 
progress 
in respect of ballot and material stashes found in warehouse 
facilities on the West Rand. The findings would also be made 
public once investigations were completed. He was not prepared 
to speculate regarding the motives of those involved. 
  "Suffice it to say that the two instances occured at the 
height of the crisis to supply particular areas that needed them 
and which could have escalated into conflict. It was at best 
gross dereliction of duty not to ensure that those materials 
reached their destination," he said. 
  He said there were also many ballot boxes originating from 
so-called "pirate polling stations" under dispute in Northern 
Natal. Discussions and attempts at mediation were in progress. 
His monitoring group had dealt with 3,500 complaints thus far 
of which 156 had been refered to the SAP and 10 to the Goldstone 
Commission. 
  By the time of his reporting 73.9 per cent of the ballot 
counting had been completed and the final tallies were expected 
by early Wednesday.

<F P=106> [Report by Greta Steyn] </F>
  [Text] The election was budgeted at R [rand] 1.25bn 
[billion] in the 1994/95 fiscal year -- almost half the expected 
budget for housing. But the final bill could be much higher as 
unexpected spending on security, extra voting days and delays in 
counting votes add to the cost. 
  The unforeseen R300m [million] bill to bring police 
allowances in line with the National Peacekeeping Force alone 
could take the overall costs to more than R1.5bn. A State 
Expenditure Department spokesman said at the weekend the 
election had been budgeted to cost R1.25bn in 1994/95 and was 
included in the spending totals released in March this year. He 
could not give a breakdown of what was included in the budgeted 
figure, but said it was possible the additional costs due to 
extra polling days could be accommodated within this amount. 
But extra spending on security would probably have to come from 
the police and defence budgets, not from the election budget. 
  He could not comment on whether the R300m cost of the pay 
rise to 80,000 police officers, announced by the TEC 
[Transitional Executive Committe] last month, could be 
accommodated within the existing police budget. The TEC trebled 
the election allowance paid to police officers to avert a 
strike. The daily payment was raised to bring it in line with 
National Peacekeeping Force members' allowances. It was also 
annnounced that SADF [South African Defense Force] soldiers 
deployed to support the SAP [South African Police] during the 
election would receive a boost in daily allowances from R15,50 
to R61,50, but the total additional cost was not disclosed. 
  Economists said the extra security spending, when added to 
the election's budgeted cost, could take the overall bill to 
more than R1.5bn. The cost could be put into perspective by 
comparing the figure to the housing budget of about R1.6bn in 
the 1993/94 year. The 1994/95 housing budget is expected to be 
about R2.6bn. 
  According to the IEC's [Independent Electoral Commission] 
preliminary budget estimates, the election would cost nearly 
R700m. (The figure did not include security costs.) The IEC 
said last week a spending update would be given once the 
election results had been announced.

  [Text] The likely victory of the African National Congress 
in South Africa's first all-race elections has been welcomed by 
several countries as a new political and economic dawn for the 
country. Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata welcomed the 
expected victory of Nelson Mandela's ANC, and said South Africa 
was now heading for democracy. 
  Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans forecast 
the 
emergence of a new economic triangle in the Indian Ocean region, 
following South Africa's return to the international fold. 
  In Hong Kong, it was said the results were predictable, and 
the greatest reason for confidence in the new South Africa was 
the quality of its leaders.

<F P=106> [From the "Morning Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Isabel Allende, vice foreign minister of Cuba, 
stated in Havana that the triumph of Nelson Mandela, candidate 
of the African National Congress [ANC] in the elections in South 
Africa, signifies the defeat of the discriminating regime of 
apartheid. She said that his victory constitutes the definitive 
word on the future of South Africans and on the equality of men, 
not only on that continent but in all the world. 
  The Cuban vice foreign minister noted that in that triumph 
there is something of the work of Cuba and of the thousands of 
Cubans who died in Angola defending the human rights of the 
African people. This is why it represents for her country much 
more than a mere electoral triumph. 
  She noted that Cuba would like to have diplomatic relations 
with an ANC government in South Africa. It is in the interests 
of both countries, but we must wait for that government to take 
office and for the situation to evolve, she said.

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva reacted this afternoon 
to the latest results of the South African elections. He told 
journalists that despite the uncertainties, all the signs are 
that it will be possible for everyone to coexist in South Africa. 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Although there are 
uncertainties, and they are clear now, it seems to us that the 
electoral results, as they are known, point to a coexistence in 
South Africa, where I hope the Portuguese will have a place, and 
a place befitting their value, in continuing to contribute to 
the progress and development of South Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] Dar es Salaam, April 30 (AFP) -- Tanzanian President 
Ali Hassan Mwinyi praised South Africans for successfully 
conducting their first democratic elections ever, and urged them 
maintain peace after the polls, officials said Saturday [30 
April]. 
  "It is only through reconciliation that the people of South 
Africa can be able to build a new, peaceful and progressive 
country," Mwinyi said in a statement to the media. 
  Mwinyi said the whole world was satisfied with last week's 
historic elections, which ended centuries of white minority in 
South Africa. 
  Tanzania was a strident critic of South Africa's apartheid 
policy which disenfranched the majority black community. 
  Mwinyi pledged to cooperate with whatever government comes 
to 
power after the elections results are declared.

  [Excerpt] Cuanza Norte Province continues to be the scene 
of fierce fighting and Eduardo dos Santos' men continue to 
suffer irreparable defeats. In a vain attempt to fulfill their 
dream of occupying the city of N'dalatando, the Luanda war 
chieftains chose to reinforce their forces with more mercenaries 
along the Dondo-N'dalatando axis. Fighting intensified when the 
forces of the Luanda regime tried to move in the direction of 
the coveted city of N'dalatando and it was especially fierce in 
the area of the bridge over Lucala II River, where the People's 
Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] left 63 
soldiers confirmed killed on the ground. Our forces also 
captured two (?VHS) two-way radios, 44 AK-47 weapons, one rocket 
launcher, and countless rounds of ammunition. 
  The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent 
in the area reports the fighting occurred in a very closed area, 
which explains why all the captured war materiel is not yet in 
the hands of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola 
[FALA] which are, however, continuing their searches. 
Mercenaries were clearly taking part in the fighting. Several 
FALA soldiers have told Firmino Lucamba, our correspondent in 
N'dalatando, that they saw many men with painted faces in the 
FAPLA ranks. 
  Meanwhile, the infantry was made to pay the price of that 
adventure. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] air force dropped bombs which 
claimed innocent civilian lives. Firmino Lukamba reports that 
the MPLA-PT air force daily carried out eight raids on the 
villages of Cuanza Norte Province. 
  Many people lost their lives in an MPLA-PT air raid 
yesterday 
morning, but it was only possible to confirm that 12-year-old 
Rosa Fernanda and 11-year-old Fatima Diogo had been wounded. It 
is worth noting that Fatima Diogo lost her parents in the course 
of the MPLA- PT air raid. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Johannesburg May 2 SAPA -- The cars of Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [MK, Spear of the Nation] chief-of-staff Siphiwe Nyanda 
and other commanders of the african national congress' military 
wing were stoned by drunk MK soldiers at the Wallmannstal 
assembly area, near Pretoria, on Monday [2 May], the area's 
combined military centre said. 
  In a statement, the Wallmannstal Joint Operations Centre 
[JOC] said MK soldiers at the assembly area were dissatisfied 
with their pay and food. 
  Mr Nyanda, "chief-of-staff of the MK contingent of the 
non-statutory element of the South African National Defence 
Force (SANDF)", was called to explain the situation to the 
disgruntled soldiers. During a meeting with the soldiers, a 
small group of drunk troops stoned Mr Nyanda and other MK 
commanders' cars. 
  Mr Nyanda asked the SADF contingent of the SANDF for help to 
keep order, the JOC said. 
  The situation was brought under control and disciplinary 
action would be taken after a thorough investigation, it said.

  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- State president-elect Nelson 
Mandela and outgoing President F W de Klerk met at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday [3 May], a spokesman for the Mr 
de Klerk's office said. He said the meeting was private and he 
did not expect the two men to make statements. 
  Mr de Klerk said on Monday evening he would hand over the 
presidency to Mr Mandela on Tuesday next week. 
  It is understood the two leaders will discuss the National 
Party's [NP] role in the Government of National Unity being 
formed in terms of the constitution. 
  Mr de Klerk, as leader of the second biggest party, is 
entitled to one of the two executive deputy presidencies. 
  For each five per cent of the national vote gained by the 
NP, 
the party will be entitled to one cabinet seat. The NP, with 
just over more 20 per cent of the vote, will be entitled to four 
cabinet seats. 
  Likely contenders for the cabinet places are serving 
ministers, among them Minister of Constitutional Development 
Roelf Meyer, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pik Botha, Minister of 
Finance Derek Keys, Minister of Public Enterprises Dawie de 
Villiers and Minister of Manpower Leon Wessels.

<F P=106> [Address by ANC President Nelson Mandela at the Carlton </F>
Hotel, Johannesburg -- live] 
  [Text] I must apologise. I have contracted a cold, and I 
hope my voice will be able to stand up to the pressures this 
evening. My doctor, who examined me very early this morning, 
asked me to rest for today and tomorrow, and to do as little 
talking as possible. He said if I do that, this cold will clear 
in two days' time. I hope you will not disclose to him that I 
did not obey his instruction. 
  Fellow South Africans, the people of South Africa, this is 
indeed a joyous night. Although not yet final, we have received 
the provisional results of the election. My friends, I can tell 
you that we are delighted by the overwhelming support for the 
African National Congress. [applause] 
  Within the last few hours I have received telephone calls 
from State President de Klerk, General Constand Viljoen, Dr. 
Zach de Beer, and Mr. Johnson Mlambo, the first deputy president 
of the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], who pledged their full 
cooperation and offered their sincere congratulations. [applause] 
  I thank them all for their support, and look forward to 
working together for our beloved country. [applause] I would 
also like to congratulate President de Klerk for the strong 
showing the National Party has displayed in this election. I 
also want to congratulate him for the many days, weeks, and 
months, and the four years that we have worked together, 
quarrelled, addressed sensitive problems, and at the end of our 
heated exchanges were able to shake hands and to drink coffee. 
  My congratulations also goes to Dr. Zach de Beer, as well 
as to General Constand Viljoen, with whom I have had numerous 
discussions and whom I regard as worthy South Africans who are 
going to make a contribution in the government of national 
unity. I also look forward to having discussions with the 
leaders of the liberation movements who have not been able to 
make the threshold. I will go to my organization because I have 
got certain ideas. They have suffered together with us. I was 
in jail with many of them. We suffered together in the 
battlefield and it has hurt me a great deal that they should not 
be able to have made the threshold which other parties have made. 
  To all those in the African National Congress and the 
democratic movements, who worked so hard these last few days, 
and through these many decades, I thank you and honor you. 
[applause] 
  To the people of South Africa and the world who are watching 
-- this is indeed a joyous night for the human spirit. This is 
your victory too. You helped end apartheid. You stood with us 
through the transition. I watched along with you all as the 
tens of thousands of our people stood patiently in long queues 
for many hours, some sleeping on the open ground, overnight, 
waiting to cast this momentous vote. South Africa's heroes are 
legends (?across) the generations, but it is you, the people who 
are our true heroes. This is one of the most important moments 
in the life of our country. I stand before you filled with deep 
pride and joy -- pride in the ordinary, humble, people of this 
country. You have shown such a calm, patient, determination to 
reclaim the country as your own and joy that we can loudly 
proclaim from the rooftops -- free at last. [applause] 
  I am your servant. I don't come to you as a leader, as one 
above others. We are a great team, leaders come and go, but the 
organization and the collective leadership that has looked after 
the fortunes of the organization will always be there, and the 
ideas I expressed are not the ideas invented in my own mind. 
They stem from our fundamental policy document, the Freedom 
Charter; from the decisions, resolutions of the National 
Conference; and from the decisions of the National Executive 
Committee. That is the nature of our organization. It is not 
individuals that matter. It is the collective leadership which 
has led this organization so skillfully. And I stand therefore 
before you humbled by your courage with a heart full of love for 
all of you. I regard it as the highest honor to lead the ANC at 
this moment in our history, and that we have been chosen to lead 
our country into the new century. 
  I pledge to use all my strength and ability to live up to 
your expectations of me, as well as the ANC. I am personally 
indebted and pay tribute to some of South Africa's greatest 
leaders, including John Dube, Josiah Gumede, J.M. Naicker, Dr. 
Abduraman, Chief Luthuli, Lillian Ngoye, Braam Fischer, Helen 
Suzman, Yusuf Dadoo, Moses Skotane, Chris Hani, and Oliver Tambo. 
  They should have been here to celebrate with us, for this is 
their achievement too. Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I 
will be back at our desks. We are rolling up our sleeves to 
begin tackling the problems our country faces. We ask you all 
to join us. Go back to your jobs in the morning. 
  Let's get South Africa working, for we must together and 
without delay begin to build a better life for all South 
Africans. This means creating jobs, building houses, providing 
education, and bringing peace and security for all. This is 
going to be the acid test of the government of national unity. 
We have emerged as the majority party on the basis of the 
program which is contained in the Reconstruction and Development 
Program. There we have outlined the steps that we are going to 
take in order to ensure a better life for all South Africans. 
  Almost all the organizations that are going to take part in 
the government of national unity have undertaken in the course 
of the campaign to contribute to the better life of our people. 
That is going to be the cornerstone, the foundation on which 
the government of national unity is going to be based. And I 
appeal to all the leaders who are going to serve in this 
government to honor that program, and to go there determined to 
contribute toward its immediate implementation. If there are 
attempts on the part of anybody to undermine that program, there 
will be serious tensions in the government of national unity. 
  We are here to honor our promises. If we fail to implement 
this program, that will be a betrayal of the trust which the 
people of South Africa have vested in us. It is a program which 
was developed by the masses of the people themselves in people's 
forums. It has been accepted by state corporations, by 
government departments, by business, by academics, by religious 
leaders, youth movements, women's organizations, and nobody will 
be entitled to participate in that government of national unity 
to oppose that plan. But I must add: We are not going to make 
the government of national unity an empty shell. 
  We want every political organization that participates in 
that government to feel that they are part and parcel of a 
government machine which is capable of accommodating their views 
within the context of the Reconstruction and Development 
Program. We do not want to reduce them into mere rubber stamps 
to rubber stamp the decision of any organization, except to say 
that that program has to be carried out without reservation. 
  The calm and tolerant atmosphere that prevailed during the 
election depicts the type of South Africa we can build. It set 
the tone for the future. We might have our differences, but we 
are one people with a common destiny in our rich variety of 
cultures and traditions. 
  We also commend the security forces for the sterling work 
done. This has laid a solid foundation for a truly professional 
security force, committed to the service of the people and 
loyalty to the new constitution. 
  People have voted for the party of their choice, and we 
respect that. This is democracy. I hold out a hand of 
friendship to the leaders of all parties and their members, and 
ask all of them to join us in working together to tackle the 
problems we face as a nation. An ANC government will serve all 
the people of South Africa, not just ANC members. We are 
looking forward to working together in a government of national 
unity. 
  It is a clear mandate for action to implement a plan to 
create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and guarantee 
freedom for all South Africans. Now is the time for 
celebration, for South Africans to join together to celebrate 
the birth of democracy. [applause] 
  Let our celebrations be in keeping with the mood set in the 
elections -- peaceful, respectful, and disciplined, showing we 
are a people ready to assume the responsibilities of government. 
I promise that I will do my best to be worthy of the faith and 
confidence you have placed in me and my organization, the 
African National Congress. Let us build the future together and 
toast a better life for all South Africans. 
  Lastly, I just want to say that in some areas we may not 
have 
done as well as we hoped. But that is how demcaracy functions. 
There should be no tensions in any region in which we have not 
emerged as the majority party. Let us stretch out our hands to 
those who have beaten us, and to say to them: We are all South 
Africans; we have had a good fight, but now this is the time to 
heal the old wounds and to build a new South Africa. [applause] 
  I also want to say that there are sports teams that were 
supposed to come to South Africa. They have not done so because 
of the state of emergency. I invite all of them to come to 
South Africa, irrespective of the state of emergency. I and the 
people of South Africa will welcome them with open hands. I 
thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Eastern Transvaal Premier-elect </F>
Matthews Phosa; place and date not given; italicized passages 
recorded] 
  [Text] Matthews Phosa is the premier-elect for the 
provincial legislature of the Eastern Transvaal Province. A 
profile on a man who has had some hard times, but also today's 
success. 
  Matthews Phosa is head of the ANC Legal Department and 
chairperson of the ANC, Eastern Transvaal. Phosa was born in 
(Mbombela) township, Nelspruit, in 1952. 
  [Phosa] I have this urban...I mean, rural background as 
a child and it was not easy living in the lowest conditions in 
Nelspruit. These are our stinking townships. I mean, the 
health conditions are bad. 
  At Phosa's secondary school the students protested against 
racial discrimination from their white teachers. 
  [Phosa] That was my turning point. They punished us 
for that. They humiliated us for that and it has left an 
indelible mark on me, and I never stopped since that time. 
  Phosa matriculated with a distinction in agricultural 
science 
and went on to study law at Turfloop. He was already very 
politically motivated. 
  [Phosa] When I looked at the conditions of our people I 
realized that we needed more lawyers than we had and I think 
that time there were few -- and I think that we had very few to 
fight for the rights of our people in (?courts) and at various 
other levels of society. 
  After completing his articles he started a legal firm and 
acquired a number of businesses. Phosa was also active in the 
political leadership of the underground and was linked with 
Mozambique and Swaziland. In 1984 he went into exile after a 
leak to the police. 
  [Phosa] And I was running a number of business. I had 
my legal practice, I had a construction company. I was a 
director in various companies. I had a mortuary. I had to 
leave everything, including leave my dear wife and little 
daughter and go into exile. 
  After military training in East Germany his unit infiltrated 
the Eastern Transvaal border. 
  [Phosa] ...commander, and I have a reputation in the 
army as a commander. I've got enough battle experience and I've 
been tested in most difficult conditions of battle. 
  As a lawyer he has been involved in defending cadres of the 
movement and in organizing the ANC legal department. Phosa 
remains committed to the Eastern Transvaal serving the region as 
ANC chairman. Matthews Phosa heads the provincial list for the 
Eastern Transvaal.

  [Text] The Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] 
Command for Cuanza Norte Province today described the 
intensification of the attacks on the city of N'dalatando, the 
provincial capital, as dangerous to the peace talks. That 
source also said that Jose Eduardo dos Santos, currently 
visiting Brazil, has given orders for the People's Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] to pursue a scorched earth 
policy against that city. Those orders are already being 
followed. 
  Since 0800 today, the government army has been using its 
heavy artillery to shell Ndalatando's outlying areas and the 
city proper. The cruel shelling has already claimed the lives 
of 300 innocent civilians. The FALA Command for Cuanza Norte 
Province believes that UN Special Representative Alioune Blondin 
Beye must immediately take steps to settle this problem, the 
implications of which are serious for the peace talks. Backed 
by long range M-46 cannons, the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] artillery has been 
shelling N'dalatando from the area of Lucala II, where the 
government infantry forces have come to a standstill after 
suffering heavy military defeats. 
  The shellings are continuing at this time and the MPLA-PT 
air 
force has also been dropping chemical and phosphorus bombs on 
the civilians areas. We have just been in touch with Firmino 
Lucamba, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
correspondent in the area, and he had this to say: 
  [Begin Lucamba recording] As I speak to you, the people of 
the city of N'dalatando and outlying areas are coming under 
systematic shelling that prevents people from going about their 
normal chores. A total of 180 M-46 shells and 120 [words 
indistinct] have been fired since 0800 today. The MPLA-PT air 
force has already carried out 18 raids, dropping bombs that are 
generally forbidden. A total of (?300) people (?have perished) 
[words indistinct] the people were asking: what does the MPLA-PT 
want to govern here in Cuanza Norte Province if it kills all the 
people and destroys everything? [end recording]

  [Text] Maseru May 2 SAPA -- Acting Lesotho Finance Minister 
Mpho Malie presented a record budget of R1.59-billion [rand] for 
the 1994/95 financial year in the National Assembly in Maseru on 
Monday [2 May]. This was a 14 per cent rise on the 1993/94 
budget. 
  Development remained the single largest area of government 
spending. The minister announced a 25.3 per cent rise in 
budgeted expenditure for devlopement to R520-million. 
  Mr Malie said the large increase demonstrated government's 
commitment to create jobs. Some 35 new projects had been 
approved for the current financial year, he said. Education 
took the second largest slice of government expenditure 
recording an increase of nearly a third to R332-million 
(R226-million). Other government department budgets included: 
public works, road construction and repairs -- R204-million 
(R169-million); health -- R124-million (R118-million); 
agriculture -- R103-million (R83.5-million) and defence -- 
R90.3-million (no previous figure). 
  Lesotho's share of customs revenue from the Southern African 
Customs Union remained the largest source of revenue, budgeted 
to total R841-million (R747-million) or 60 per cent of the 
1994/95 budget. 
  The rise was due to the continued importation of goods used 
in the construction of the Lesotho Highland Water Project. 
  However, the minister warned revenue from these imports 
would 
taper off in the next few years as the main construction work on 
the water project was completed.

  [Text] The four leaders of the United Opposition Front of 
Djibouti who were arrested in Djibouti on 30 January are now 
free. A Djibouti tribunal sentenced them to a three-month prison 
term this morning. They have already been detained for three 
months pending their trial. 
  The four leaders, including Cheiko, leader of the United 
Front, were accused of having publicly supported the armed 
struggle of the Front for the Restoration of Unity and 
Democracy. The exact terms of the bill of indictment are: Call 
for armed struggle, not followed by results. This sentence 
amounts to releasing them, since the accused have already spent 
three months in jail. Ghislaine Dupont asked their lawyer, Mr. 
Aref, if this sentence could be construed as a gesture of 
appeasement by the authorities. Listen to Mr. Aref's answer: 
  [Begin Aref recording] My opinion is completely different. I 
believe that this sentence is an expression of unease. I say 
this for two reasons. The first reason is that the acts, of 
which they were accused, were not carried out. If my clients 
did actually jointly sign a resolution with other political 
parties in Addis Ababa, they never carried out such a 
provocation. Besides, they always disputed the facts. They 
said that their intentions and their acts were always to lead a 
political, a peaceful, struggle in the town of Djibouti itself. 
This is the first reason. The second reason is that as long as 
the case is covered by the secrecy of investigation, people do 
not know anything. When the case comes in the open, people 
attend the trial, whatever their opinion. They are then clearly 
informed of the origins and conclusions of the case. Only then 
can they have a precise idea more closely tied to reality. I 
believe that the sentence which was handed over today reflects 
this unease. [end recording]

Daniel arap Moi today sent a congratulatory message to Mr. 
Nelson Mandela for being elected president of South Africa and 
the victory of his African National Congress party in the 
just-concluded South African elections. [passage omitted]. 
  It was through your statesmanship, patience, valour and 
sacrifice that the entire population of South Africa has now a 
chance to lay a firm foundation to build a new nation based on 
equality and democracy. 
  Kenya has in the past supported your struggle and indeed 
looked forward to the dismantling of racial inequality in South 
Africa. Your excellency, Kenya is proud of your victory. We 
look forward to cooperating with the new South Africa for the 
mutual benefit of our two peoples. 
  Your excellency, once again, accept my heartfelt 
congratulations, as I wish the new South Africa peace and 
prosperity.

  [Text] Refugees entering from Burundi are required to 
surrender their weapons to the head of their respective camps 
immediately, in order to ensure their security and that of their 
countrymen. This was a directive issued yesterday by Kibondo 
District Commissioner (Thomas Kingi), when he was explaining to 
refugees at (Kamomba) Camp that they are required to respect all 
of this country's laws when they arrive. Ndugu (Kingi) said 
that the refugees who decide to return to Burundi will be given 
their weapons back, after they satisfy their respective refugee 
camp heads that they acquired those weapons legally. The 
district commissioner also said that refugees who want to go out 
of their camps and return later, and those who decide to go back 
to Burundi, should report to the heads of the camps instead of 
running away. Those found to be violating the law shall be 
prosecuted.

  [Text] A news just coming in says: In furtherance of the 
ongoing peace process in Liberia, the leader of the National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, 
has opted to send a high-powered delegation to Monrovia to hold 
discussions with the Liberian Peace Council [LPC], aimed at 
resolving the conflict in Rivercess and parts of Sinoe County. 
In a press release today, Mr. Taylor said while the NPFL is 
fully aware that the LPC is not a party to the Cotonou Peace 
Accord, yet because of the love he has for the Liberian people 
and his desire for peace and national reconciliation, a 
delegation will leave Gbarnga shortly to hold discussions in 
Monrovia. The NPFL leader is, therefore, urging the special 
representative to Liberia and head of UNOMIL [UN Observer 
Mission to Liberia], Ambassador Gordon-Somers, to provide full 
security protection and sponsorship for the ensuing talks.

  [Text] Massive international and local support is building 
up for the acceptance of Liberia's newly appointed foreign 
minister, Mrs. D. Musuleng-Cooper, in the transitional 
government. Local press reports in Monrovia itself are calling 
on the Council of State to immediately accept Mrs. Cooper's 
appointment, to accelerate the peace process. 
  In its yesterday's editorial, the independent EYE newspaper 
said it is frankly not in agreement with the decision of the 
Council of State to appoint a neutral person to head the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The EYE newspaper said any attempt 
to do so by the Council of State would be in contravention of 
the Cotonou Accord, which gives the parties the right to 
distribute cabinet posts after consultation among themselves. 
  The EYE editorial said it is of the belief that the council 
can be forceful in pinning down the parties to reach an 
agreement on the issue, instead of circumventing the accord. 
The newspaper then asked if the Council of State feels it has 
the power to appoint cabinet minister -- then why didn't it do 
so ever since. The EYE editorial continued: If it is true that 
such a thing were agreed to have prompted the NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] to withdraw Counselor Momolu Sirleaf 
and replace him with Mrs. Musuleng-Cooper, then it is fair 
enough to accept the conditions agreed upon. Doing otherwise 
will only show bad intention, which will certainly create 
problems for the peace process, the paper said. 
  The EYE newspaper said it suspects problems will develop if 
attempts are made to outmaneuver others on what has been 
negotiated and agreed. The paper then implored the Council of 
State to be bold and act without committing itself to 
consciously breech the Cotonou Accord. 
  Meanwhile, the man representing the NPFL in the Council of 
State, Vice Chairman Isaac Musa, has asserted that Mrs. 
D.Musuleng-Cooper will not be changed by the Council of State. 
Vice Chairman Musa said the Cotonou Agreement does not give any 
right to the council to reject any nominee from the party. 
  On the question of appointing a neutral person to the 
Foreign 
Ministry, Mr. Musa repeated that, directly or in directly, all 
Liberians took part in the war, and will therefore not go along 
with the council's decision to reject the NPFL nominee. Vice 
Chairman Musa noted that our people have suffered too long, 
saying the council should try to find means of ending the war 
and see how displaced people and the refugee problem can be 
solved. He said the council is wasting time on issues that have 
been dealt with. Vice Chairman Musa said prices of local 
commodities on the local market are very high, noting that the 
council should do something to handle such problems. 
  Meanwhile, the leadership of the NPFL says any drift in the 
Cotonou peace accord could lead to a total breakdown on the 
peace process. The NPFL says Council Chairman David Kpomakpor 
should stop making decisions without the knowledge of other 
members of the council, saying this is unacceptable. The leader 
of the NPFL, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has repeatedly asserted 
that the council has no dismissing or firing powers.

  [Text] The suspended amir of Agai in Niger State, Alhaji 
Abubakar Tahiru, will soon appear in court in connection with 
the recent assassination of the former chairman of the Agai 
local government, Alhaji Ibrahim Sado. 
  The state commissioner of police, Alhaji Hakim Abdulahi, 
disclosed this while addressing newsmen in Minna. He said 
(?with the) suspension of the amir, more people have provided 
the police with useful information on the murder case. Alhaji 
Hakim Abdulahi said although before the suspension of the amir 
the police command had received substantial information that 
implicated him to the murder. [sentence as heard] 
  In a related development, six students of the Federal 
Polytechnic, Bida, have been arrested by the state police 
command while attempting to kill their lecturer, Mr. Festus 
Akindo Lani, over what they described as the lecturer's 
wickedness. According to the police commissioner, the students 
have confessed that they wanted to kill the lecturer to create 
fears in the mind of other wicked lecturers in the institution 
to force them to always dance to their tune. Alhaji Hakim 
Abdulahi said a sharp knife was recovered from one of the 
students in the house of the lecturer by detectives who had 
earlier been drafted to his residence following a tip-off.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, said in 
Abuja today that the planned demarcation of the maritime borders 
between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea will benefit both 
countries economically and socially. Gen. Abacha was speaking 
to Mr. Juan Olo Mba, Equatorial Guinea's petroleum resources 
minister, who brought a special message from President Nguema 
Obiang Mbasogo. The head of state affirmed Nigeria's commitment 
to maintain the warm and brotherly relations with Equatorial 
Guinea's president. The visiting envoy spoke of Equatorial 
Guinea's wish to strengthen its relations with Nigeria. He said 
his country desires the patronage of Nigerian businessmen in its 
timber industry. Mr. Mba disclosed that the Equatorial Guinean 
president wants to visit to Nigeria.

  [Text] Violence is back on the agenda in Lome, Togo. Five 
Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese capital 
last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in the Be 
district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of death 
and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of their 
inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack. The 
targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to be 
mostly patronized by Europeans. 
  Politically, problems are piling up in the country. Edem 
Kodjo, the prime minister appointed by General Eyadema and who 
is still finding it difficult to convince his opposition allies 
to join him, hinted yesterday that he may resign if his allies 
continue to refuse to take part in the government he plans to 
form. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz reports for Africa No.1: 
  [Begin da Cruz recording] The negotiations begun a week ago 
between the two parties of the Togolese parliamentary majority 
have actually been disrupted following Mr. Agboyibor's Action 
Committee for Renewal [CAR]'s restatement of its decision not to 
participate in any government to be formed by Mr. Kodjo, a 
decision reiterated in a communique issued by the CAR yesterday 
evening. The communique stated that at the 3 May meeting 
between delegations of the two majority parties, the Togolese 
Union for Democracy [UTD] made it clear that if the CAR 
maintains its decision, the alternative would be for Mr. Kodjo 
to resign. UTD officials do not deny that such a decision is 
possible should the CAR drive its ally to the wall, but they add 
that they have never maintained that that is the only stand to 
adopt. They further explain that the question is whether the 
CAR has gauged the consequences of its action and is prepared to 
assume responsibility for them. 
  So, as I said earlier, the CAR has reiterated its decision 
to 
stay out of Mr. Kodjo's government. Is Mr. Kodjo prepared for a 
coalition or an alliance with the former single ruling party, 
the Rally of the Togolese People? The UTD executive's answer is 
no. In this case, the only way out for Mr. Kodjo -- assuming he 
does not resign -- would be to form a government based on the 
civil society or on possible deserters from the erstwhile ally, 
a situation already experienced by the former prime minister in 
forming his last two governments. 
  In another development, five Frenchmen and a Beninese were 
injured last night following the explosion of a grenade thrown 
into a restaurant where they happened to be at about 2100. It 
is not yet known who committed the act, or their reasons for 
their doing so. The injured persons are not in danger of death.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alves Antonio in Lusaka] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. The Angolan peace talks being held in 
Lusaka were unproductive today. The government and National 
Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiators 
did not achieve anything. They are staying put on the 
modalities for the implementation of the second round of 
presidential elections. The mediators presented a new version, 
which the government and UNITA negotiating teams assessed this 
afternoon. Blondin Beye is doing everything to dissipate doubts 
and overcome the differences. So far that has not been easy. 
The next hours may be decisive. 
  Meanwhile, a source close to the talks told our reporters 
here that Paul Hare, U.S. president's special envoy to Angola's 
peace negotiations, leaves Lusaka for Luanda tomorrow, where he 
will within the next few days meet with His Excellency Engineer 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos, president of the Republic. It is 
presumed that the U.S. diplomat will report to President dos 
Santos on the results of talks held recently by the U.S. 
Administration and Congress in Washington. It has been reported 
in Lusaka that Ambassador Hare is presently on a diplomatic tour 
that may have some impact on the government-UNITA talks. Our 
reporters have also learned from reliable source says that U.S. 
Senator Paul Simon is scheduled to visit Angola this month, 
having expressed in Washington the wish to meet with the Angolan 
head of state, Jose Eduardo dos Santos and UNITA leader Jonas 
Savimbi.

  [Text] President Bill Clinton's special envoy is scheduled 
to arrive in Luanda tomorrow, carrying a message for President 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There has been a great deal of 
speculation about the contents of the missive, but Ambassador 
Jose Patricio clarifies the issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Patricio] There has been a great deal of 
speculation about the letter. The letter has not yet been 
delivered, and even the spokesman is not where our president is 
right now. So, the news media should wait for the unfolding of 
events instead of fabricating facts. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] So, the letter has definitely 
not been delivered to the Angolan head of state. 
  [Patricio] No. As far as I know, the letter will be 
delivered by Ambassador Paul Hare, President Bill Clinton's 
special envoy, to President Jose Eduardo dos Santos during the 
course of the week. 
  [Correspondent] Other media reports say in his letter the 
U.S. president asks the government to give the governorship of 
Huambo Province and the Ministry of Public Works to UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. Is that 
true? 
  [Patricio] That is mere speculation. The contents of the 
letter are still secret. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Nelson Mandela's electoral victory has been 
welcomed in Angola. Acting President of the Republic Franca van 
Dunem says the victory of Mandela and the ANC is also a victory 
for the Angolan people. 
  [Begin Van Dunem recording] I am pleased that the ANC 
struggle has culminated with its victory at the polls. I am 
convinced that my sentiment is shared by the majority of 
Angolans, who, for many years now, have rubbed shoulders with 
South African nationalists, and have given their best to make 
today's celebrations a reality throughout Africa. Likewise, the 
efforts of Angolans over the past years, which culminated in the 
ANC victory....[changes thought] I am convinced that the victory 
of the ANC and the South African people in general will be 
beneficial to developments throughout Africa. [end recording] 
[passage omitted] 
  Prime Minister Marcolino Moco is pleased with the outcome of 
the South African elections. 
  [Begin recording] [Moco] It is not an issue that only 
affects 
Angola. Obviously, Angola will benefit from the new situation 
that has been created in southern Africa. I would like to 
stress, however, that over the past years this process has 
attracted the attention of the whole world, and Africa in 
particular. It is not only a question of an ANC electoral 
victory, but fundamentally a process of liberation and struggle 
against racial segregation and of oppression of men by men. So, 
I think the ANC victory is very good for us because the ANC 
consists of our friends, who have fought by our side. I would 
like to stress the major change that is taking place in the 
world right now with the acknowledgment of all the victories the 
South African people have scored in the past few years. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] As South African president, 
will 
Nelson Mandela ask to play a more important role in the Angolan 
peace process? 
  [Moco] Any country involved in a process like this depends 
fundamentally on its own people and on the capacity of its 
politicians. That has been proven in South Africa. Like I said 
earlier, with the completion of the liberation process and of 
elections in South Africa, Nelson Mandela and his country will 
know how to make a major contribution to Angola's progress, 
including the peace process and development, because we are 
aware that South Africa is a major economic power. 
  [Correspondent] But what about the ongoing Lusaka talks? 
  [Moco] Well, I think the Lusaka talks have made a great deal 
of progress, despite a number of difficulties. What matters 
with the South African experience is to specifically consolidate 
the peace process in Angola and in southern Africa in general. 
I think this will be a very useful experience. The fact that 
Nelson Mandela and other South African politicians now have more 
time to take part in African meetings, particularly in southern 
Africa, will be very useful to us in general. [end recording]

  [Text] The president, Sir Ketumile Masire, has 
congratulated the South African president-elect, Mr. Nelson 
Mandela, for his victory in South Africa's first multiracial 
election. In his message President Masire said it is a victory 
that the people of South Africa have yearned for, fought for, 
and died for over the centuries. He said Mr. Mandela's own 
personal struggle against apartheid is the epitome of the 
suffering South Africans had to endure for freedom and human 
rights. 
  President Masire expresses the hope that as South Africans 
celebrate their election victory and remember their fallen 
heroes, they will at the same time dedicate themselves to a 
future free of racial bigotry and the tyranny of the majority. 
Sir Ketumile expresses the hope that under Mr. Mandela's 
leadership the struggle for economic integration of the 
underprivileged people of South Africa will be carried out 
smoothly and with due regard to the interests of everyone. He 
says he looks forward to working with Mr. Mandela at the 
bilateral, regional and international levels. Sir Ketumile said 
South Africa has a great role to play in southern Africa and 
will be welcomed into the SADC [Southern African Development 
Community] family.

  [Text] Yesterday, the Mozambican Government asked for a 
meeting of the Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, to be 
postponed. That meeting was supposed to discuss the 
disappearance of more than 12,000 Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, 
soldiers, according to estimates presented by the UN Operations 
in Mozambique, Unomoz. 
  Aldo Ajello, the UN secretary general's representative in 
Mozambique, has said in Maputo that the Mozambican Government 
delegation to the CSC has asked for a postponement to study the 
report and the number of soldiers said to be missing. The 
government had initially handed in to the Cease-Fire Commission, 
CCF, a list of 76,000 soldiers but then, without any 
explanation, that figure came down to 64,000 men. 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana, the second man in the 
government team to the CSC, had said in mid-April that the 
figures produced by the government were viable and that Unomoz 
was using outdated information. Observers in the Mozambican 
capital admit the possibility that the Mozambican (?Defense 
Ministry) could have submitted lists containing false or 
outdated information, including soldiers killed or missing in 
action, as well as deserters.

<F P=106> [Unsigned editorial] </F>
  [Text] We believed that two events that occurred in the 
space of about a month, but apparently of minor importance, have 
put at stake the views advocated by Afonso Dhlakama, and 
supported by Aldo Ajello and some Western countries, regarding 
the question of the future armed forces personnel. 
  First situation. A South African traditional chief 
accompanied by ranch farmers from that country deliberately 
crossed the border into our country, allegedly searching for 
cattle stolen by Mozambicans. A number of people told DOMINGO 
that it was not the first time that the incident has taken 
place. South African farmers often enter Mozambique in search 
of cattle allegedly stolen. This is extremely worrisome, since 
it is a gross violation of the Mozambican border. More than 
that, it is a violation of our country's sovereignty. There is 
no proof that in fact Mozambicans have stolen South African 
cattle, at least the traditional chief did not give any 
evidence. But even if there was proof, the issue should not be 
solved by South Africans crossing the border to come and "fetch" 
what is alleged to have been stolen from them. To have a 
country as a neighbor, is not like having a family as neighbors. 
There are appropriate channels for dealing with state matters. 
  Second Situation. Allegedly to halt the exodus of 
Mozambicans to that country, and to block the flow of smugglers 
of assorted goods, South African soldiers deliberately made a 
unilateral decision: They dropped leaflets over the Mozambican 
territory threatening to electrify the border. Once more, this 
is a very worrisome situation. Probably there is to be an 
exodus of Mozambicans into South Africa. We say probably 
because we have no figures to confirm it. Likewise, there could 
probably be a flow of smugglers. But since one is dealing with 
a border issue, there are procedures to be followed. The South 
African authorities -- military, political, or others -- cannot 
make unilateral decisions. The measures to be taken should be 
discussed by the two states, according to international norms. 
  Returning to the early issue. Mozambique has a vast border 
area with a number of countries: South Africa, Swaziland, 
Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania. One cannot completely 
rule out the assumption that in future yet another of these 
states will take similar measures or even more serious ones. It 
will be recalled that the "Young Pioneers" issue has not yet 
been resolved. Among other issues... 
  To say that 7,500 men are enough to defend Mozambique, is 
something one cannot understand in the least. It is difficult 
to understand the basis for such a proposal. The same can be 
said if the number is doubled. A total of 15,000 men is not 
enough to defend a third of the Mozambican territory. Even the 
30,000 men that have been mentioned only serve to make the 
Mozambican state fragile and very vulnerable. 
  The fact that Mozambique is poor, or the poorest in the 
world 
cannot by any means mean that the country should not have the 
minimum capacity to defend itself. 
  If one is willing to help the country then one should not 
make the country fragile and without capacity to defend itself.

  [Text] (Beira) We have received the following report and 
opinion from a UN source in Sofala Province: 
  Every day here in Beira, we receive refugees or people 
seeking refugee status. They come from countries such as Zaire, 
Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Tanzania, Zambia, Somalia, and 
Zimbabwe. No Malawians have been asking for refugee status. 
Those people come from countries beset by internal conflicts 
where per capita income is very low. Some of those conflicts 
have been followed by the United Nations, which is supervising 
the Mozambican peace process now. 
  Whoever is familiar with international politics will not 
have 
any illusions concerning the role of the United Nations. They 
will know that, contrary to what many people think, it is not 
the United Nations that rules the roost but, rather, the parties 
that are behind those conflicts. Even now, they are the ones 
that dictate to the international community the slow pace of 
pacification. 
  The government stopped demobilizing its troops two weeks ago 
and demobilization was postponed in all assembly areas. The 
reason given was that the Mozambique National Resistance's 
demobilization process was going very slowly. 
  Be that as it may, the Mozambique Armed Forces, FAM, 
soldiers 
in Nhangao assembly area did not like that and started 
threatening the UN observers, even though the latter had nothing 
to do with national decisions made by the Supervision and 
Control Commission, CSC. 
  A solution to this problem was sought with Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Tembo, Cease-Fire Commission representative in the Central 
Region. A total of 500 soldiers -- double the usual number of 
soldiers to be demobilized at any given time -- started applying 
pressure and received the promise that they would be demobilized 
on 3 May. 
  Yesterday, 2 May, was a holiday. All officials involved in 
the process, including the observers, financial personnel, 
Technical Unit [not further identified] and International 
Migration Organization, OIM, officials were preparing for today 
but at midday were told that the demobilization had not been 
authorized. As I write this, we are looking for Lt. Col. Tembi, 
so he can inform his troops about that decision, which will 
almost certainly be poorly received. 
  Whoever came from Chimoio on 1 May must have witnessed the 
departure of trucks carrying UN Italian forces for the last time. 
  Many will blame the United Nations, if war resumes in 
Mozambique. 
  However, peace cannot be imposed, neither by the United 
Nations nor by other nations. It is necessary that those who 
made war genuinely want peace. 
  Everyone should understand that.

  [Text] President of the Republic Joaquim Chissano has said 
that the ANC's electoral victory in the first multiracial 
elections in South Africa is the victory of all the national 
liberation movements, and illustrates the real image of a 
political force that since its establishment had deep roots at 
all levels, identifying itself with the highest aspirations of 
the South African people. In a message saluting Nelson Mandela, 
President Joaquim Chissano congratulates the ANC and the South 
African people for this victory. In his message, the head of the 
Mozambican state expresses the wish to develop fruitful 
relations of cooperation with the fraternal people and 
government in South Africa, consolidating the historical ties 
which unite the two peoples and states.

<F P=106> [Interview with interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya </F>
by Gerald Papy in Bujumbura; date not given] 
  [Text] A fair number of observers are predicting that 
Burundian interim President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya will play a 
key role in the stability of the country. President of the 
National Assembly and of the FRODEBU [Burundian Democratic 
Front] majority party, Ntibantunganya, who claims that recent 
events have brought the government and army closer together, has 
been designated to serve as the interim government leader 
following the death of former head of state, Cyprien 
Ntaryiamira, who was assassinated in Kigali. A rather frail 
figure in a grey suit, he is a man who has established himself 
following the conflict in Kamenge, the Hutu "rebel" stronghold 
in Bujumbura, and who consented to receive us in his residence 
overlooking the capital. 
  [Papy] The Kamenge crisis turned out to be a major political 
test for the government. Was it a successful one? 
  [Ntibantunganya] I have personally congratulated the army on 
its behaviour while the crisis was being resolved, both the 
command and the troops in general. The aim of the disarmament 
operation was to carry it out while causing as little damage as 
possible. And that was what duly happened. It should serve as 
an example for the security of the capital. However, 
disarmament alone is not enough. We must now examine the defense 
and security of the population in a global context, break the 
yoke of distrust between the population and its army, encourage 
this rapprochement so that reasonable solutions can be found in 
tense situations. 
<H5>  The Debate Is Open </H5>
  [Papy] Is army reform a path that must be trodden in order 
to 
ensure stability in Burundi? 
  [Ntibantunganya] The problem with the army (which has a 
Tutsi 
majority -- LA LIBRE BELGIQUE editor's note) must be analyzed by 
all of the country's leading politicians. The debate is open. 
Moreover, you know, the army is not opposed to this. Even 
before June 1993 (the date of democratic elections), a report 
pointing to the same conclusion was drawn up by the military 
institute itself. What is more, I would hope that people might 
take a fresh look at it now. I do not think there is a need to 
deal with the problem in terms of "ethnic quotas." Rather, we 
must get to grips with it in the general framework of the 
various state corps: The police, the army, and the 
administration on the basis of ideological, regional, and ethnic 
criteria so that these institutions are representative, legal, 
and respectful of human rights. 
  [Papy] Claims are being made that a certain military 
hierarchy which has gained in strength through the present 
collaboration is actively backing your candidacy in the 
presidential elections. Is this true? 
  [Ntibantunganya] First of all, the time has not yet come to 
stand as a candidate. The current priority is to restore 
security. Secondly, the army should not support a single 
candidate, but rather the political authorities he represents 
within the framework of democratic mechanisms. 
  [Papy] There are those who reproach the FRODEBU of being 
incapable managers, the prime illustration of this supposedly 
being the "rebellion" in Kamenge, which was supported by some of 
your members. 
  [Ntibantunganya] It should be recalled that the government 
established after the elections did not have the time to 
establish its authority. President Ndadaye was assassinated 
just 102 days after coming to power. Then he was hunted down 
and the country was left to its own devices. How can you be 
expected to govern a country as large as this one responsibly 
when you lose two presidents in the space of six months? On the 
other hand, the reaction after the tragic death of Cyprien 
Ntaryiamira was positive. The country stayed calm and we did not 
experience any spiral of violence like in Rwanda. 
<H5>  Disinterest </H5>
  On this latter point, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya deplores the 
disinterest of the international community and "the abdication 
of responsibilities" by the United Nations which "is setting up 
a Human Rights Commission and at the same time showing that it 
is incapable of guaranteeing even the very first of these 
rights, the right to live." Furthermore, the Burundian Interim 
President is calling for the presence in Bujumbura of UN civil 
authorities who would serve as a base from which the democratic 
process could be observed and monitored. 
  Today, President Ntibantunganya is being forced to face up 
to 
one priority: "To stamp out extremism" with the help of the 
population.

  [Text] Concerning the victory of Nelson Mandela's African 
National Congress in the first multiracial elections in the 
Republic of South Africa, Gabonese President Omar Bongo has 
welcomed the openness advocated by Mr. Mandela. Here he is 
speaking to Hassan Nze: 
  [Begin Bongo recording] What is significant is Mandela's 
message, that he wants to rule with all the political parties. 
It is this collegial power structure which Africa lacks. Each 
time there is an election and a gesture is made towards the 
losers, they say: We do not want to do this, we do want to do 
that. I believe that in this instance Mandela is giving an 
example. We must also congratulate de Klerk, who immediately 
acknowledged Mandela's victory and accepted working with him in 
the same government. Honestly, I wish that all Africans could 
behave in the same way, that is to say, as though the country 
belongs to everybody. We must understand that ruling 
single-handedly, ruling without the opposition....[pauses] We 
must understand that those who contest elections and expect 
alternation must join the government, in order to learn how 
things work, so that the day they become president things are 
easier for them. I therefore believe that Mandela and de Klerk 
have just given us -- both governors and opposition leaders -- a 
lesson. Mandela chose to leave the past behind him and not 
exclude whites, he did not seek revenge because he was the 
oldest prisoner, he did not say that he would only govern with 
his party and friends, he reached out to everyone. [end

  [Text] Nairobi, May 3 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels and 
government representatives gathered Tuesday [3 May] in the 
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, where the United Nations and 
Tanzania are trying to broker peace talks, diplomats said. 
  UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh met separately 
with both sides to persuade the rebels to open face-to-face 
talks with the interim government which they do not recognise. 
  The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front has ruled out a dialogue 
with the "government of killers" and said its representatives 
would go to Arusha only to brief Tanzanian officials on their 
position in the Rwandan conflict. 
  Organisation of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed 
Salim and Tanzanian Prime Minister John Malecela, who is to 
chair the talks, were expected in Arusha later Tuesday, 
according to diplomats contacted by telephone. 
  Ten days ago Tanzania failed to bring the two sides to the 
negotiating table for an earlier round of talks, also in Arusha 
where the rebela and government signed peace accords last August 
to end a three-year civil war. 
  The government delegation failed to turn up, and the rebels 
said that they would refuse to talk to them even if they did. 
  But the rebels have agreed to meet military officers to 
discuss ways of halting the carnage in Rwanda, which has cost 
more than 100,000 lives since the death of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana in an April 6 rocket attack on his plane rekindled 
the war and plunged the tiny central African country into chaos. 
  The ethnic and political bloodbath has sparked a massive 
refugee exodus. Between a quarter and half a million Rwandans 
poured across the border to Tanzania last week.

  [Text] John Malecela, prime minister and first vice 
president, has reiterated that the achievement of peace in 
Rwanda will depend on an agreement by all sides involved in the 
country's conflict. Speaking to a Rwandan Government delegation 
which is in the country for peace talks, Honorable Malecela said 
last night that all sides in the conflict must agree on three 
issues which are vital to ending the hatred between them. The 
prime minister said the issues include the need to immediately 
stop the war between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front [RPF] forces, an end to the killing of innocent civilians, 
and the implementation of the peace agreement signed in Arusha 
in August last year. 
  The Rwandan Government delegation led by Communications and 
Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura and that of the RPF led by 
RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe are in Arusha for a meeting 
aimed at bringing peace to Rwanda. Because of the RPF's stand 
that it cannot sit at the same table as the government 
delegation, the prime minister is compelled to meet the 
delegations in different sessions at the Arusha State Lodge. 
This morning Honorable Malecela has held talks with the RPF 
delegation.

  [Text] Nairobi, 4 May (AFP) -- UN special representative 
for Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has had "informal contacts" 
over the past 24 hours in Arusha, Tanzania, with the warring 
Rwanda parties but no actual negotiations have taken place, UN 
officials said Wednesday [4 May]. "There have been many 
informal contacts with the two delegations, with Tanzanian 
authorities and different ambassadors who came to Arusha", said 
in Tanzania Moctar Gueye, spokesman for the United Nations 
Mission for Assistance to Rwanda (MINUAR). 
  Booh-Booh is to travel Wednesday to Kampala to meet Ugandan 
President Yoweri Museveni, and return the same day to Arusha, 
Gueye said. The interim Rwandan Government accuses Uganda of 
aiding the Rwandan Tutsi rebels, the Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
  Gueye said the United Nations remained "optimistic" there 
might be a formal meeting of the delegations (FPR). [sentence 
as received] 
  The Rwandan Government delegation is led by Transport 
Minister Andre Ntagerura while the rebels, who are mainly Tutsi, 
are led by a member of the Hutu ethnic group, Alexis 
Kanyarengwe. The rebels have refused to meet with the 
government, which they do not recognize. Jacques Bihozagara, 
the rebels' foreign affairs representative, reiterated this 
stand Tuesday saying that a ceasefire "would protect the 
killers."

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] reiterates its 
position, that it cannot negotiate with a government of 
criminals which continues to decimate a proportion of the 
Rwandan population. If any RPF delegations go to Tanzania, (?it 
is not) to hold any talks with the fictitious government, but 
only to (?ask) President Ali Hassan Mwinyi for explanations 
about the situation, which is making any contact with [words 
indistinct] impossible. 
  In addition to this [words indistinct] Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
the UN secretary general, asking the UN Security Council to meet 
in order to take a decision. Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali wants 
foreign troops sent to Rwanda, however, not one European country 
wants to release a single soldier, and the United Nations, which 
fears another Somali-style experience, considers that the issue 
should be dealt with by the OAU. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding OAU forces, the RPF's position remains crystal 
clear: At this point, any intervention by foreign troops is 
really useless. Whether they are UN or OAU forces, they are all 
the more useless because genocide has already been committed. 
It is too late, it is really insane, to hear the United Nations 
pretending to be willing to send its troops in, when it has 
withdrawn UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] troops while 
huge numbers of Rwandans were being massacred in front of their 
eyes. [passage omitted] 
  Everybody can remember the manner in which the UNAMIR Blue 
Berets abandoned more than 2,000 people at (Kituitsiro) 
Technical School, while these people were under their 
protection, thus abandoning them to the barbarity of the 
Presidential Guards and the Interahamwe [Republican National 
Movement for Democracy and Development militias] militias, who 
immediately massacred them. Whoever remembers this case -- and 
we are mentioning only this specific case -- wonders what the UN 
Security Council has in mind when it dares to suggest the 
dispatch of foreign troops to Rwanda. Is it to protect hundreds 
of thousands of corpses in a state of decomposition? Or to 
protect old residential buildings? Why does the UN Security 
Council not think of rescuing those who have escaped the 
massacres but are still stranded in ravines, or those who are 
dying a slow death at the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, 
dying from hunger, from thirst, from lack of medical care and 
from lack of hygiene? [passage omitted] 
  The RPF believes that, if the international community 
intends 
to carry out any form of intervention in Rwanda, it should come 
within the scope of humanitarian aid, notably food and health 
aspects, given the famine and all its consequences which are 
causing the death of those who have escaped the massacres and 
the lack of medical care for the wounded as well as the threat 
of epidemics due to the decomposition of corpses which are 
littered throughout the country. It is in that framework that 
international intervention is necessary, otherwise foreign armed 
forces would have only been useful if deployed in time to 
prevent the slaughter of such a large proportion of the 
population. At the moment their intervention is useless. The 
time for this has passed.

  [Text] Kigali, May 3 (AFP) -- Heavy mortar fire rocked the 
Rwandan capital Kigali on Tuesday [3 May] as rebel leaders and 
government ministers gathered in Tanzania where the United 
Nations is trying to bring them to the negotiating table. 
  The headquarters of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) 
in 
east Kigali came under heavy fire from government forces, said 
Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR). 
  The rebels returned fire from different parts of the 
capital, 
targeting a military camp in the south-east and other government 
positions in the south, said Kabia, speaking by telephone from 
Kigali. 
  An international official in Kigali said the rebels, 
surrounding Kigali, "could take the city any time they want." 
  RPF chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe and the interim government's 
Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura meanwhile held separate talks 
with Tanzanian mediators and UN officials in the northern 
Tanzanian town of Arusha, a UN official said. 
  UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said he would try 
to persuade the rebels to open face-to-face talks with the 
interim government, which they do not recognise. 
  But Tanzanian officials said they were "not optimistic" that 
the rebels would agree to talk with the government, which they 
have branded "a clique of killers." 
  The rebels said earlier that their leaders' mission in 
Arusha 
was limited to briefing Tanzanian officials on their position in 
the Rwandan conflict. 
  But the rebels have agreed to meet military officers to 
discuss ways of halting the carnage in Rwanda, which has cost 
more than 100,000 lives since the death of president Juvenal 
Habyarimana in an April 6 rocket attack on his plane rekindled 
the war and plunged the tiny central African country into chaos. 
  "We hope that the military men in both delegations will 
agree 
to meet," Booh-Booh told AFP by telephone. 
  Ten days ago Tanzania failed to organise an earlier round of 
talks, also in Arusha where the rebels and government signed 
peace accords last August to end a three-year civil war. 
  Rwanda's bloodbath has sparked a massive refugee exodus. 
Between a quarter and half a million Rwandans poured across the 
border to Tanzania last week. 
  The rebels are mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe which 
has 
borne the brunt of the slaughter, while the government is 
predominantly from the majority Hutu group. 
  Refugees in Tanzania said both government forces and rebels 
had massacred civilians. 
  UN troops trying to evacuate about 300 terrified Rwandan 
civilians from a Kigali hotel were delayed by mortar fire and 
small arms exchanges, Kabia said. 
  The civilians, mainly Tutsis, had been pinned down for weeks 
by fighting. 
  UN soldiers evacuated 11 foreigners from Kigali to the 
Kenyan 
capital Nairobi on Monday. Most foreigners were evacuated weeks 
ago. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali meanwhile stepped 
up 
his campaign to persuade African nations to send a large 
peacekeeping force to Rwanda, diplomats said. 
  The United States, which has pledged 15 million dollars in 
aid for Rwanda, says it will also help finance an international 
military intervention. 
  But no Western countries have offered troops. 
  The United Nations slashed its force in Rwanda from 2,500 to 
270 last month after 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed.

[UNAMIR] were wounded on Tuesday [3 May] night during shelling 
of Kigali airport. A UNAMIR spokesman announced this as violent 
fighting was continuing in Kigali. Mortar shells which hit the 
airport were launched by the Rwandan Patriotic Front forces, who 
were responding to shots fired by the government forces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jerome Bicamumpaka by </F>
correspondent Beate Mueller-Blattau; place and date not 
given--recorded, in French with superimposed translation in 
German] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Welcome to the first part of Villa Bonn. 
The civil war and mass murders in Rwanda have, according to 
international estimates, already brought a death toll of 
200,000. Half a million people have fled in the past few days to 
Tanzania. Most of them belong to the Hutu population, which at 
the moment also forms the transitional government. They are 
fleeing from the rebels of the Patriotic Front of Rwanda -- who 
are mostly Tutsis -- who are taking revenge for the Hutu army's 
massacre of the civilian population. Beate Mueller-Blattau 
spoke with Jerome Bicamumpaka, the Rwandan foreign minister of 
the Hutu transitional government. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Minister, a soldier of the UN Blue Helmets 
in Kigali has said of the soldiers of the Rwandan Army, and also 
of the rebels, roughly: They are savages, they are behaving 
like animals. They are all murderers, the one side and the 
other. Is this true? 
  [Bicamumpaka] I would say that this is partly true. It is 
like this. The soldiers of the Patriotic Front -- the RPF -- 
attacked Rwanda from the neighboring country of Uganda. In so 
doing they broke the cease-fire that was negotiated in April of 
last year. Then, however, on 6 April, the RPF rebels attacked 
Rwandan Army positions in the north, on the Ugandan border, and 
also in Kigali. During these attacks they carried out massacres 
of the civilian population, because these people had helped the 
Army when the RPF opened fire. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] I still do not understand. You say that 
civilians were killed during these attacks. Were they Hutus or 
Tutsis? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You should realize that the Patriotic Front 
consists almost 100 percent of Tutsis. So there are very few 
Hutus in the RPF. The civilians slaughtered by the rebels were 
mainly Hutus, people living on the border with Uganda. To go 
back to the Rwandan Army, it was attacked in Kigali, too, and 
there the rebels infiltrated their fighters into private houses 
that belonged to people who are accomplices of the RPF. The 
Rwandan Army then did the following: They attacked the houses 
of the RPF-sympathizers in order to get hold of the rebels. 
Civilians were killed in the process. Incidentally, those who 
were hiding RPF rebels in Kigali were predominantly Tutsis. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] But I still do not understand. Are you 
trying to say that the Tutsis are the guilty ones and the Hutus 
innocent? 
  [Bicamumpaka] It is not a question of claiming that one side 
is guilty and the other side innocent. It is a question of what 
occurred on 6 April this year and the causes of the massacre. 
At that time the RPF not only assassinated the Rwandan 
president, but also, shortly afterward, the rebels attacked the 
Rwandan Army's military camps in Kigali and in the north of the 
country. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So who has been murdering whom? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You cannot say that it is the Army that has 
committed the atrocities. It was the people of the different 
ethnic groups slaughtering each other. Our army has even 
prevented murders. There is no more killing. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Can there be any reason on earth that 
justifies these massacres? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, these murders are never justified, this 
war 
is completely absurd. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] But you still have not answered my 
question 
-- who killed whom? For us it is very difficult to understand 
all this. 
  [Bicamumpaka] Before any investigations have been carried 
out 
it is very difficult to say exactly that this person has 
murdered that one. But to put it in general terms, the Tutsis 
and Hutus have massacred each other to an equal extent. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] It wasn't just the Tutsis who were the 
victims. Some reports say that about 5,000 people, mainly 
Tutsis, were detained in a stadium in Kigali and that every 
night about 40 to 50 of them were shot dead. 
  [Bicamumpaka] That is true, about 5,000 refugees are there. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Tutsis? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, they are not just Tutsis. There are of 
course Hutus there too. In Kigali there are, for example, 
hotels accommodating both Hutu and Tutsi refugees. Five hundred 
people are at present living in the [word indistinct] hotel. 
There is a gymnasium accommodating at least 3,000 refugees, 
both Hutus and Tutsis. But the RPF rebels have been shooting at 
these places with artillery for the past few days -- for example 
the school with the 3,000 people. They are therefore attacking 
Hutus, Tutsis, men, women, and children. The rebels are doing 
this in order to arouse international attention and claim 
afterward that it was the Rwandan Army. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So, it is just the rebels who are 
murdering, not the Army? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, the Army is not killing any civilians, 
while the RPF is murdering innocent people. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] Not the Army? 
  [Bicamumpaka] No, at most there are a few exceptions. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] The Army consists of Hutus, and the 
rebels of Tutsis. Is that right? So the two tribes are in fact 
again fighting each other? 
  [Bicamumpaka] You cannot put it in such sweeping terms. The 
RPF rebels have already said that they are not in the least 
interested in whether all the Tutsis, thus their own people, are 
massacred in the country's interior. It is a matter of total 
indifference to the Patriotic Front. It wants power in the 
country and nothing else. If the rebels do not even defend the 
Tutsis and even arbitrarily subject them to dangers, it is proof 
that they have totally different aims. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] A very complicated civil war is taking 
place in your country, but you still claim that your 
government's Army is disciplined and does not kill. That is 
very difficult to believe. 
  [Bicamumpaka] Of course the Army kills, but it kills the 
aggressor. The rebels are attacking the soldiers, that means 
that members of the Rwandan Army are merely defending 
themselves, just like in war. Our army's soldiers are killing 
their enemies, but our government's military do not attack 
provinces and communities in order to murder civilians there. 
That is shown for example by the fact that our government has 
convened assemblies in many communities in order to halt the 
massacres. We have succeeded in this in the seven prefectures 
under our control. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] How many people have been killed so far? 
  [Bicamumpaka] One thing is certain, I regard the figure of 
100,000 given by the Red Cross as grossly exaggerated. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So how many was it exactly? 
  [Bicamumpaka] Perhaps 10,000, but it is difficult to say 
without exact counting. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] So the Red Cross is wrong? They gave the 
information that at least 100,000 were massacred. 
  [Bicamumpaka] But the Red Cross cannot know that. How can it 
know precise figures? The Red Cross gives humanitarian aid. It 
cannot count the number of wounded and dead or even estimate 
them. How could it? There are no witnesses to give evidence. 
There is no personnel that could gain specific on-site 
information, that is not even possible in Kigali. 
  [Mueller-Blattau] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali withdrew 
most of his Blue Helmet troops from Rwanda only a week ago. Now 
only around 270 are still there. Was that a mistake on the 
United Nation's part? 
  [Bicamumpaka] The withdrawal of the UN Blue Helmets was a 
very bad decision by the Security Council. Since 9 April, that 
is since the start of our transitional government, we officially 
asked that the Blue Helmets should on no account be reduced, on 
the contrary, we wanted more UN soldiers. We asked above all 
that the withdrawn Belgian contingent should be replaced by the 
UN Blue Helmets.

  [Text] Tension mounted again in Kinshasa when, in the 
absence of Monsignor Monsengwo, president of the High Council of 
the Republic-Transitional Parliament (HCR-PT) (who is attending 
the Synod in Rome), an open conflict broke out between Second 
Deputy President Anzuluni (presidential faction) and the 
pro-Tshisekedi opposition. 
  Mr. Ndjoko, representing the Tshisekedi team in Brussels, 
told LA LIBRE BELGIQUE that the seat of the assembly had been 
invaded by 600 agents of the Special Presidential Division (DSP) 
in civilian dress on Tuesday [3 May], while 1,200 of them in 
uniform surrounded the building to prevent access and 300 
others, in civilian dress, searched the deputies. 
<H5>  New Duplication </H5>
  According to Mr. Ndjoko, the USORAL [Sacred Union of the 
Radical Opposition and Allies] refused to take part in the 
plenary session on Tuesday in these conditions, while the 
members of the assembly office belonging to the opposition 
convened a plenary session on their side "to confirm" Mr. 
Tshisekedi as prime minister, in other words "a new duplication 
of the institutions." 
  Zairian Ambassador to Brussels Kimbulu told us that there 
had 
been no deployment of force at the HCR-PT on Tuesday "either 
inside or outside," and that no plenary session was held on that 
day. "Between 0800 and 1200 GMT, councillors were registered in 
commissions. At 1400 GMT, the office met to count the 
commissions and those registered. That is all." On Monday, AFP 
press agency reports, the councillors had still not managed to 
determine the conditions in which the future prime minister, the 
object of the conflict, is to be appointed. This conflict took 
a violent turn last Thursday. Mr. Anzuluni had called in the 
forces of law and order, when the opposition was staging a 
disturbance to prevent the session from being held; two 
deputies, Mr. Mutshipaye Ilunga and Mr. Lumbu Lumbu, had ribs 
broken; Dr. Ntambwe had his skull fractured by a blow with the 
butt of a rifle and died from his injuries. 
<H5>  Who for Prime Minister? </H5>
  According to Mr. Ndjoko, the opposition met on 18 April in 
the absence of the URD [Union for the Republic and Democracy] (a 
sub- platform of the USORAL) and the UDI [Union of Independent 
Democrats] (Kengo wa Dondo's party); 62 out of 80 were present 
and 54 voted for Tshisekedi. On 28 April, the HCR office 
eliminated the other candidates because they had been submitted 
individually and not through the USORAL. 
  In presidential circles, it is being reaffirmed that the 
prime minister must be presented by the opposition but "after 
consultation with the political class," which, according to 
these circles, amounts to demanding a consensus on this person. 
And, according to Ambassador Kimbulu, the office has accepted 
six candidates: Mr. Tshisekedi, Mr. Kengo, Mr. Beyeye, Mr. 
Malumba Bangula, Mr. Lunda Bululu, and Mr. Mulumba Lukoji.

  [Excerpts] The executive committee of the High Council of 
the Republic-Transitional Parliament today presented a report to 
the plenary session on the various candidacies for premiership. 
Seven out of 14 candidacies were retained for being in line 
with the spirit of Article 78 of the transitional Constitution. 
This report will be discussed on 4 May but in the meantime 
parliamentary procedures will be put in place. Ekofo Isausu has 
the details: 
  [Isausu] [passage omitted] The seven candidates retained are 
the following: Peye Yejeme, Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda, 
Kengo-wa-Dondo, Lunda Bululu, Malumba Mbangula, Etienne 
Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, and Mulumba Lukoji. They are considered 
as candidates of the Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and 
Allies. Candidates whose applications were rejected are: 
Faustin Birindwa, (Jembi Kalubiyi Manchanga), (Kanga Fubiye), 
(Gudu Mbangana), and Arthur Zaidi Ngoma. 
  No applications fully complied with the laid down conditions 
because the negotiations that should have been held inside and 
outside the various groups did not take place. However, the 
committee said it accepted the seven candidacies because they 
are in line with Article 78 of the transitional Constitution and 
in line with its preconditions and can therefore be submitted to 
the head of state for the appointment of a prime minister.

  [Text] Pretoria May 4 SAPA -- Unauthorised aircraft would 
not be allowed to fly over Pretoria during the inauguration of 
the state president on Tuesday [10 May] next week, the South 
African Air Force [SAAF] announced on Wednesday. 
  The SAAF said in a statement the occasion could lead to an 
influx of aircraft wishing to observe the ceremony from the air 
with "the inherent danger of an accident being ever present". 
"It should be quite clear that flight safety is of utmost 
importance and cannot be compromised in any way. It has 
therefore been deemed appropriate to keep the skies over 
Pretoria as uncluttered as possible." 
  At the request of the national inaugural committee's sub- 
committee on security, the air space over Pretoria would be 
strictly controlled during the inauguration. 
  Only flights specifically authorised by the Air Force would 
be allowed to enter Waterkloof air space or operate South of 
Wonderboom airport during this time. "The necessary 
co-ordination mechanisms between the SAAF command post and air 
traffic control at Wonderboom have been established. In 
addition to static radar installations, a mobile unit will be 
deployed to ensure unbroken coverage at both high and low level. 
The SAAF will place its own aircraft on standing air patrols to 
enforce the measures," the statement said.

<F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>
  [Text] A bruising fight for the deputy presidency had 
developed between ANC chairman Thabo Mbeki and secretary-general 
Cyril Ramaphosa, while Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee and 
Finance Minister Derek Keys were likely to hold their posts, ANC 
insiders speculated yesterday. 
  Mandela, who is due to announce his Cabinet next week, is 
likely to select three to five "Cabinet secretaries" to oversee 
Cabinet Departments and make up the ANC's exclusive "inner 
sanctum". 
  Tipped for these posts are Mbeki or Ramaphosa to oversee 
Foreign Affairs and Defence, ANC economic planning department 
head Trevor Manuel to oversee economic and financial matters and 
SACP [South-African Communist Party] chairman Joe Slovo to 
oversee judicial and constitutional issues. Other Cabinet 
secretaries will oversee welfare, education, social services and 
administration. 
  Having a "cabinet within a Cabinet" would allow Mandela to 
retain Keys and Coetsee in their posts by making them 
responsible to a higher, but less experienced, authority. 
  The debate over a Reconstruction and Development portfolio 
is 
continuing, with some arguing that it would cut across too many 
other portfolios. Former COSATU [Congress of South African 
Trade Unions] general secretary Jay Naidoo is favoured to take 
such a portfolio. 
  Other good bets would be mainly from the ANC's national 
executive committee, including: Law and Order -- Sydney 
Mufamadi; Trade and Industry -- Tito Mboweni; Mineral and Energy 
Affairs -- Marcel Golding; Health -- Nkosazana Zuma; Posts and 
Telecommunications -- Pallo Jordan; Science and Technology -- 
Mohammed Valli Moosa; Women and Youth -- Gertrude Shope; 
Information -- Gill Marcus; Sport -- Steve Tshwete; 
Constitutional Development -- Zola Skweyiya; and Commission for 
Administration -- Josiah Jele. 
  Other NP [National Party] members could be Foreign Minister 
Pik Botha, Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Botha, 
Constitutional Affairs Minister Roelf Meyer and Public 
Enterprises Minister Dawie de Villiers. Meyer could be offered 
Justice, but speculation that Botha will retain Foreign Affairs 
is understood to be unfounded. 
  Mandela has indicated his desire to placate right-wing 
whites 
and could retain Agriculture Minister Kraai van Niekerk or his 
deputy, Tobie Meyer. 
  He also wants to include a PAC member in the Cabinet and 
could be constitutionally required to include Inkatha leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Several minor posts, including Transport, 
Water Affairs and Forestry, could go to these candidates. 
  Education could go to ANC education desk head John Samuels, 
although he may not be elected in which case Randell van den 
Heever could be a candidate. 
  Former ANC Youth League leader Peter Mokaba has positioned 
himself to be Tourism Minister, while Mac Maharaj and Pravin 
Gordhan are likely to be included. Former COSATU members, 
including Chris Dlamini and Alec Erwin, seem likely candidates 
for Manpower Minister.

  [Text] General Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front has 
put a damper on expectations that he could accept a cabinet 
post, saying that his real job is to be with his people and to 
find a land area for Afrikaners who choose to be together. 
However, Gen. Viljoen said that he would have to discuss the 
issue with Mr. Nelson Mandela before deciding finally. Last 
night, Mr. Mandela praised Gen. Viljoen, describing him as a 
worthy South African who would make a contribution to the 
government of national unity. It was later rumored that he 
could even be appointed Minister of Defense. Projections for the 
National Assembly at this stage show the Freedom Front taking 13 
seats, seven short of the 20 required for a cabinet post.

  [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [AZAPO] on Tuesday [3 May] congratulated African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela on his party's 
election victory and pledged to be supportive, but critical, of 
an ANC-led government of national unity. 
  However, AZAPO President Itumeleng Mosala warned that the 
government of national unity was incapable of meeting the 
political and economic aspirations of the black majority. "Our 
people did not choose a government. They merely endorsed a 
settlement," he said of last week's elections. 
  Prof Mosala said at a press conference in Cape Town the 
interim constitution compromised the demands of the black 
majority on land and the transfer of power. A coalition 
government could not deliver desperately-needed socio-economic 
transformation. "The poverty and alienation of our people is so 
desperate that you need an effective government to deal with 
these issues. This settlement has failed to bring about a 
transfer of power to an effective government and has betrayed 
the interests of our people." 
  Prof Mosala said he had noted Mr Mandela's offer to 
accommodate leaders of the Pan-Africanist Congress and AZAPO in 
his cabinet, but no formal offer had yet been made. "AZAPO will 
receive whatever gesture is made in the spirit in which it is 
made. Our central committee will consider the matter and 
respond." 
  He said AZAPO would not "act as spoilers" to frustrate the 
implementation of the ANC's Reconstruction and Development 
Programme, but would seek support for alternative development 
programmes. 
  Prof Mosala predicted AZAPO would become "the political home 
of millions" as the masses became disillusioned with a new 
government's failure to deliver socio-economic change. "We will 
fight the elections next time round and we will win those 
elections. AZAPO also intends winning the Western Cape when the 
time comes." He said the ANC failed to win the Western Cape 
because it "failed to take seriously" the needs and fears of the 
coloured community.

"ANC Elections Victory"] 
  [Text] COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], and 
our entire membership of 1.3 million workers salute the African 
National Congress, and President Nelson Mandela for their 
magnificent elections victory. This is a victory which 
thousands of members of COSATU have worked tirelessly for over 
the last few months. It is fitting that workers were able to 
celebrate this victory on May Day. 
  The decisive victory of the African National Congress is a 
triumph for the people of South Africa in their struggle for 
democracy and social justice. In particular it is a victory for 
the working people. Workers voted for the ANC in their millions 
because the ANC has represented their aspirations over the 
years, and has a clear plan to build a better life for them and 
their families. 
  The overwhelming majority of workers voted against the 
negative and racist campaign of the NP [National Party]. They 
voted in the knowledge that NP rule means exploitation, 
division, and privilege for the few. 
  The ANC's positive message of peace, jobs, housing, 
education, and a better life for all struck a deep chord in the 
working people of our country. This message had credibility 
because of the clear programme of reconstruction and development 
[RDP] which the ANC put to the nation. 
  COSATU welcomes last night's statement of President Mandela 
that the RDP will be the cornerstone of the government of 
national unity, and that all parties will be expected to work 
within this framework. We believe that this is the unambiguous 
mandate given by the electorate. Trade unions and other 
organisations of civil society will do all in our power to 
ensure that the RDP is not blocked by any grouping elections [as 
received]. We dip our flag in the memory of COSATU members and 
leaders killed in their attempt to ensure free political 
activity, including those comrades killed in Ulundi shortly 
before the elections. 
  Now is the time for us to rebuild our country and 
reconstruct 
our economy. We call on business to join us and the democratic 
government in creating jobs and basic social infrastructure for 
all our people. The prospects for a significant economic boom 
are extremely bright. We must not squander this opportunity on 
speculative economic activity and white elephants. Our priority 
is to restructure our industries in a manner which creates 
sustainable economic growth and development aimed at addressing 
poverty and extreme inequality. If all South Africans commit 
themselves to this goal, we will witness an economic and social 
miracle unprecedented in our country's history.

  [Text] Pietersburg May 3 SAPA -- Former Lebowa Chief 
Minister Nelson Ramodike on Tuesday [3 May] said his homeland 
government had achieved far less than he had hoped for and the 
successes scored were too few to console his people. Adressing 
former cabinet ministers on Tuesday, Mr Ramodike congratulated 
South African President-elect Nelson Mandela and the African 
National Congress on their election victory. 
  He said it was through Mr Mandela's leadership that "we have 
all learnt the strength of unity and togetherness, a unity of 
common purpose and fellowship". Mr Ramodike urged all political 
parties to heed Mr Mandela's plea to bury the hatchet. 
  He said Lebowa's history was one of tragedy and remorse and 
that in spite of the "frantic attempts that we have made to 
overcome the barriers, the successes we have scored have been 
far too little to console the hunger and anger of our people". 
  He said when he assumed leadership of the homeland the 
immediate challenge was to uproot corruption in government 
departments. "I took the initiative to have a commission of 
inquiry appointed to expose mismanagement and misappropriation 
of funds in the territory...the findings of the commission, 
which were appalling to say the least, were turned against me 
and my cabinet. 
  "One wonders what it could have cost the taxpayer had I, 
like 
many of the other homeland leaders, suppressed and covered up 
the graft that was taking place in this territory."

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] With just over half the ballots counted in the South 
African elections, one party which looks to have failed badly is 
the Pan-Africanist Congress, the PAC. It is currently in sixth 
place with just over 1 percent. It is unlikely to reach the 5 
percent of the vote needed to secure an automatic cabinet post. 
On the line to Johannesburg, Timothy Ecott asked the PAC's 
chairman in the central Transvaal region, Moses Mavundla, if he 
was disappointed with their result: 
  [Begin recording] [Mavundla] Yes, we are obviously shocked 
at 
the results. We did not expect them to be as they are. That's 
why we have had reservations about the entire process when it's 
being done without the direct involvement of the international 
community. 
  [Ecott] But what do you feel specifically has been wrong 
with 
these elections from your point of view? 
  [Mavundla] Well, to start with the leveling of the playing 
field. That was the major aspect. The monies were released 
rather too late and by the time we received the monies we were 
already disadvantaged, whereas if the monies had been released 
much earlier I am sure our campaign machinery would have been 
much more effective. 
  [Ecott] Your critics, of course, will say that the poor turn 
out in the polls just proves that the PAC was always a very 
marginal political force in South Africa. 
  [Mavundla] The question is if the regime had that belief 
that 
we were marginal, when we called them to meet PAC outside the 
country in Zimbabwe and in Botswana, why did they to start with 
bother to meet us? If they believed that we were that marginal, 
surely they would not have bothered to waste time with PAC. But 
we believe that we are not marginal. We represent a broad 
spectrum of the people in the country. 
  [Ecott] But at the moment you are showing less support than 
people like the Democratic Party and even the Afrikaner 
Volksfront [National Front] [name as heard]. 
  [Mavundla] Well, you have got to understand that people had 
to exercise their choice. Our supporters may have decided that 
the important thing is to oust the regime and by supporting, 
throwing some of their votes toward one of the liberation 
movements, particularly a single liberation as it has won now -- 
ANC -- they may have believed that by so doing they would 
enhance the oppressed masses in ousting the regime. The 
important thing is that PAC is not out. PAC is still in and we 
still believe that we still have a contribution to make toward 
the final liberation of our people, in particular with regard to 
the return of the land to the rightful owners. 
  [Ecott] Mr. Mandela has already indicated that parties which 
have not done particularly well in the polls will probably still 
get a chance of serve in the cabinet. Are you still prepared to 
work with him? 
  [Mavundla] As soon as Mr. Mandela has met with our president 
and that issue with regard to the concomitant terms or 
conditions, those that would be discussed by PAC and a decision 
will be taken whether or not to accept that. [end recording]

  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- The Pan-Africanist Congress 
[PAC] has been admitted as a member of the Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC]. According to a proclamation by 
President F. W. de Klerk in a special government gazette of 
Tuesday, the PAC is now a participant. 
  Although TEC sittings have finished -- its management 
committee may meet on Monday -- the move will give the PAC a 
seat on the joint military command council which is planning the 
new South African National Defence Force [SANDF]. 
  The PAC will now be entitled to have its Azanian People's 
Liberation Army cadres included in the new SANDF.

  [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- Western Cape premier-elect 
Hernus Kriel on Tuesday [3 May] pledged himself to 
reconciliation with political opponents and co-operation with 
the central government. 
  At a press conference Mr Kriel, who led the National Party 
to 
its only regional victory, said he had already had cordial 
telephonic discussions with African National Congress Western 
Cape leader Allan Boesak. 
  He was optimistic they would have a good working 
relationship. At a meeting on Tuesday afternoon they would 
discuss matters such as the composition of a 10-member 
provincial cabinet. The NP would have six members and the ANC 
four. He did not foresee problems in co-operating with the 
ANC-dominated central government. Its rights and powers would 
be respected, but those of the region would be jealously guarded. 
  The government of the Western Cape would work together with 
the central government in a spirit of reconciliation and 
co-operation. "There is no animosity from our side whatsoever." 
He was aware of racial tensions as the result of the elections 
in the Western Cape and developing a reconciliation programme 
would be a priority. 
  "We will have to work out a plan of action to tackle that 
problem, but it is something we have to do along with the ANC 
and this will be started as soon as the new cabinet meets. We 
must put our political fight behind us and become 
task-orientated in serving the community. We want to make the 
Western Cape the jewel province of the new South Africa." 
  He expressed appreciation for calls by ANC leader Nelson 
Mandela and the Congress of South African Trade Unions for 
acceptance of the result. He would meet community leaders soon. 
"I will go out of my way to meet leaders to assure them of the 
good intentions of the National Party. In the final analysis we 
will have to prove ourselves, and we intend doing that." 
  Other priorities were social upliftment, economic 
development, peace and security. He was not averse to the ANC's 
Reconstruction and Development Programme but it would have to be 
adapted to resouces in the Western Cape. Affordability and 
timeframes would be factors. 
  Mr Kriel said he would seek support of the other parties to 
change the name of the area to "Cape of Good Hope", but this 
would not be done unilaterally.

  [Text] Cape Town May 3 SAPA -- African National Congress 
Western Cape leader Dr Allan Boesak on Tuesday congratulated his 
National Party [NP] counterpart, Mr Hernus Kriel, for the NP's 
clear win in the region. Speaking at a press conference, Dr 
Boesak said the ANC was determined to give its full co-operation 
in the NP- led government of provincial unity. "I do not 
believe this is the time for recrimination, threats or grudges, 
but for building and working together for all our people. 
Whatever work we do will not be for ANC members, but for the 
people of the Western Cape." 
  While the ANC's Western Cape region was disappointed with 
the 
provincial outcome it rejoiced in the party's national victory. 
  "I think the ANC has fought a valiant battle...Against 
tremendous odds," Dr Boesak said. Conceding a "clear NP win" in 
the Western Cape, he said he would again like to congratulate Mr 
Kriel for his party's victory. The ANC's defeat could be 
attributed to the brief period in which it had to reverse 
antagonistic public perceptions; an electorate which voted for 
NP leader Mr F. W. de Klerk rather than Mr Kriel; and a 
well-honed NP media image. 
  Dr Boesak said the ANC's commitment to its programme of 
reconstruction and development was unchanged and it would work 
as hard as it could in the provincial government for the crucial 
programme to be implemented. This was not just because no other 
parties had a similar plan "but so the NP can see there is no 
subsitute for what the ANC is bringing to the people of South 
Africa". 
  He did not believe there would be any tensions between the 
ANC and NP if the NP went along with the reconstruction 
programme. "But if the NP tries to block it there will be 
tensions." Healing the scars left by the NP's racially-tainted 
election campaign would be an important long-term focus for the 
ANC and the government of provincial unity. 
  Dr Boesak said he had not detected any signs of an ANC 
backlash against the Western Cape result, which by mid-Tuesday 
had shown the NP leading the ANC with a 25 per cent margin. 
"Especially the people of the Western Cape should not for one 
single moment worry about what the ANC is going to do in the 
government."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- The announcement of 
results in South Africa's historic elections came to a dramatic 
halt Tuesday [3 May] evening as election officials apparently 
decided to have a re-think of the whole counting procedure. 
  The counting of the estimated 19 million votes had already 
dragged on for four days, and the opening of provincial 
assemblies, originally scheduled for Thursday, had been 
postponed to Saturday because the composition of the party blocs 
was still far from being decided. There was no immediate 
official word from the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], 
the body overseeing the poll, on why it had halted its running 
flow of the latest voting count, but sources said it was having 
a look at the entire procedure and that it might be as long as 
24 hours before it was ready to resume announcing results. 
  IEC Media Director Pieter Cronje said, in response to 
inquiries from the media, that he was unaware of any such halts, 
but would investigate. Meanwhile, after the last results for 
the present were issued shortly after 6 PM Tuesday, the crucial 
two-thirds majority sought by the African National Congress 
appeared to be beyond reach. At that stage 12,073,405 counted 
votes from last week's polling had been released. 
  Standing at 62.5 per cent of the poll, the ANC had to win 
more than 76 per cent of the anticipated outstanding votes to 
reach the 67 per cent mark which would allow it to change the 
negotiated interim constitution at will. 
  While there were neither definitive statistics on the number 
of eligible voters nor how many cast their ballots last week, 
IEC Spokesman Kumi Naidoo anticipated the final poll would stand 
between 70 and 85 per cent of an estimated 22.45 million voters. 
On these figures, the ANC would require between 76.58 and 85.43 
per cent of the remaining votes to reach the two-thirds mark. 
  But trends since midnight on Monday to 6 PM on Tuesday 
suggested the ANC majority was being reduced by the Inkatha 
Freedom Party, probably as delayed KwaZulu/Natal results 
trickled in. The IFP had risen to 8.3 per cent from 5.8 per 
cent in this period, while the ANC share had fallen from 63.8 to 
a low of 62.2 before recovering to 62.5. 
  The second-placed National Party [NP] dropped to 22.1 per 
cent from 23 per cent during this period. The Freedom Front 
[FF] in fourth place had 2.7 per cent, followed by the 
Democratic Party (1.7) and the Pan-Africanist Congress (1.3). 
The African Christian Democratic Party was the only other party 
in contention for parliament. 
  Of the nine regions, the ANC had surged ahead in four. It 
had recorded a massive 90.5 per cent in the Northern Transvaal, 
84.9 per cent in the Eastern Cape, 81.7 per cent in the Eastern 
Transvaal, and 76.5 per cent in the Orange Free State. 
  The ANC's majorities in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] and Northern Cape were 55 and 49.7 per cent. But 
in KwaZulu/Natal the IFP maintained its majority of about 53.5 
per cent with an estimated quarter of the counted votes released. 
  In the Western Cape, the ANC conceded defeat to the NP which 
had a 54.9 per cent majority after nearly two million votes had 
been released. 
  Meanwhile, the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] 
management committee postponed the first sitting of the nine 
provincial parliaments from Thursday to Saturday, presumably 
because of the slow rate of counting. Likewise, the first 
meeting of the National Assembly was rescheduled to Monday. 
  The TEC's decision was based on information from the IEC. Mr 
Naidoo said the IEC met on Tuesday afternoon to discuss, among 
other things, the announcement of final provisional results and 
the certification of the election.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] representative Helen Suzman on Tuesday [3 May] 
night said a delay in incoming results was because of a "delay 
all over", but she denied serious problems. The only problem 
was "one or two" counting stations which had requested help with 
reconciliation, she said. Asked why there was a breakdown in 
the flow of results, Mrs Suzman responded: "It is because there 
is a delay all over." 
  Reliable sources said earlier a halt to all further election 
results issues had been called, and might last 24 hours.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 3 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] was revamping its counting procedures overnight 
with election results expected to flow again on Wednesday [4 
May] morning, the IEC said Tuesday night. 
  The vote counting was to be accelerated by entering the 
total 
number of votes recorded at counting stations as the basis for 
accumulating national and provincial tallies. This would 
replace the old system, which involved the entry into the count 
of batches of 2-3000 votes from the counting stations as the 
figures came in. 
  "This changeover will take place during the course of the 
night and results will continue to flow during the course of the 
morning," the IEC statement said. The commission stressed it 
had not stopped counting votes.

  [Text] No election results have been announced since 
yesterday evening, but they should begin flowing again this 
morning. The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] decided to 
revise its counting procedures last night, and instead of 
entering batches of votes into the computer as they come in, 
they are now entering the total number of votes at counting 
stations. 
  IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje says the vote counting is 
complete in all regions except the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] and KwaZulu/Natal, and that more than 50 percent of 
the votes in KwaZulu/Natal have been counted. He said the final 
allocations of seats in the National Assembly and the provincial 
legislatures and a ruling on whether the election was free and 
fair could be expected late tomorrow afternoon. 
  The last results showed that with just over 53 percent of 
the 
votes counted the ANC had 62.5 percent compared with 22 percent 
for the NP [National Party], and 8.3 percent for the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party]. The Freedom Front has 3 percent, 
followed by the DP [Democratic Party] with 1.7 percent, and the 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] with 1.3.

  [Text] Durban May 3 SAPA -- The African National Congress 
Midlands region in KwaZulu/Natal on Tuesday [3 May] claimed 
large-scale voting irregularities, particularly in areas north 
of the Tugela River. "We are obviously concerned and anxious 
about this lead (in election results in the province by the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]). We are convinced there has been 
massive irregularities," said ANC spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande. 
  The IFP's Dr Ziba Jiyane earlier predicted a 60 per cent 
majority for his party, adding that the IFP had overwhelming 
support north of the Tugela River. "This lead is not a true 
reflection of the IFP's popularity," Dr Nzimande said. 
  On Tuesday afternoon an Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] report gave the IFP a lead of 21.4 per cent over its ANC 
rival. Dr Nzimande said the three ANC Natal regions were 
meeting to discuss "this grave situation". 
  Discrepancies were noted in votes cast, particularly in 
KwaZulu- administrated areas, and had been forwarded to the IEC 
for investigation, he said. He said even in rural areas, where 
the ANC had a marginal support base, "it doesn't reflect at all".

  [Text] A caucus of the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly is to 
meet in Ulundi today to discuss claims of electoral fraud in 
KwaZulu-Natal. A spokesman for the assembly said there would 
also be discussions on the future of legislative assembly 
members after the inauguration of the new provincial legislature 
in Pietermaritzburg. He said King Goodwill Zwelithini planned to 
address the meeting. 
  The IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] said earlier that 
it was investigating allegations by the ANC of massive election 
fraud by the IFP in KwaZulu-Natal. IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] 
spokesman Frank Mdlalose has denied the ANC allegations. He 
told REUTER that he was not aware of any fraud orchestrated by 
the IFP. Commenting on the IEC investigation, Dr. Mdlalose said 
he doubted its impartiality because there were too many ANC 
sympathizers in the commission. An ANC official in 
KwaZulu-Natal said the party had information that ballot boxes 
from IFP strongholds in rural areas of the region had been 
tampered with.

  [Text] Ulundi May 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday [4 May] said it was 
extraordinary that claims of electoral fraud were being levelled 
against his party in KwaZulu/Natal when provisional results 
showed the IFP was "whipping" the African National Congress and 
National Party [NP] in the province. 
  Speaking to the press during a break in a caucus meeting of 
the KwaZulu legislative assembly in Ulundi, Mr Buthelezi warned 
a Pandora's box could be opened if the allegations against the 
IFP were accepted. The IFP leader said: "Our election has been 
straight-forward." 
  He said the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] had 
assured him on Wednesday morning that counting of votes in 
Durban would continue after a hitch in the process because of 
disputes. 
  Mr Buthelezi questioned why irregularities, which were 
widespread, had been singled out in KwaZulu/Natal. He said this 
was unusual since National Party leader F W de Klerk, 
Independent Electoral Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann 
Kriegler and ANC leader Nelson Mandela had "huddled together" 
and declared the elections free and fair. 
  According to provisional results the IFP was "whipping" the 
ANC and NP in the region, Mr Buthelezi said, adding this proved 
he was the undisputed leader in the province. 
  Having entered the election race at such a late stage and 
with very little campaigning, the IFP's success was inspiring, 
he said. 
  "That kind of confidence in me and my party inspires 
me...and 
braces me for the very hard road I know lies ahead," Mr 
Buthelezi said. 
  He said he would be prepared to re-run elections in the 
region "tomorrow" if it could be proved the process would be 
foolproof. 
  Mr Buthelezi said the row over claims against his party by 
the ANC was typical of what he was used to. "When the ANC 
sneezes everyone catches cold; when I say something it's 
ignored," Mr Buthelezi said.

  [Text] Ulundi May 4 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had learnt with great 
relief on Wednesday [4 May] afternoon the African National 
Congress had withdrawn charges of electoral fraud against his 
party. The IFP leader told an impromptu Ulundi press briefing he 
would stand by the election results if the other parties did so. 
  Mr Buthelezi said it was "very mean" of the ANC to have made 
a mountain out of a molehill over claimed IFP irregularities in 
the voting process. He said he was concerned about the anger 
which could have generated. 
  Mr Buthelezi said he had entered the all-race elections on 
the understanding that he would stand by the results. 
  In spite of reservations about the process "I don't think 
there is any possibility of me turning around, rejecting the 
results". 
  He said that would be construed as sour grapes.

  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- Basie Smit -- the police 
general embroiled in a controversial Goldstone report that 
allegedly implicates top policemen in "third force" activities 
-- is to retire at the end of May. 
  Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said in a statement 
on Tuesday [3 May] night Lt-Gen Smit "has decided to retire from 
service on superannuation at the end of May 1994. It is indeed 
sad to lose such an experienced and dedicated general and I wish 
him and his family everything of the best." 
  In the same statement, Gen van der Merwe pledged the SAP's 
[South African Police] "wholehearted" support for Transvaal 
Attorney General Jan D'Oliveira who had apparently criticised 
police for a lack of cooperation in the investigation into 
alleged "third force" activities. "I wish to give the assurance 
that the South African Police will, as in the past, continue to 
give its wholehearted support to Dr D'Oliveira and his team and 
that everything possible will be done in order to prevent the 
investigation being hindered in any way," said Gen van der Merwe. 
  He added: "I also wish to dispel any impression which may 
have been created that the South African Police is in conflict 
with the Goldstone Commission. The South African Police will, 
as in the past, continue to offer its complete cooperation to 
the Goldstone Commission." 
  Gen van der Merwe also committed the SAP to the country's 
new 
dispensation. "...I wish to emphasize that the South African 
Police has committed itself to enter the new dispensation with 
confidence and enthusiasm, and will protect and serve the 
government and the community with dedication."

  [Text] The Goldstone Commission has released its report on 
the preliminary inquiry into the attempted purchase of firearms 
by the KwaZulu Government from Eskom [Electricity Supply 
Commission]. The commission said it was disturbing that the 
commissioner of police had issued an export permit for the 
weapons without realizing the sensitivity of the matter. The 
commission found that the sale of 1,000 semi-automatic rifles to 
the KwaZulu Police had not been authorized by the management of 
Eskom, but that the sale had been arranged without authority by 
an employee of the company. The commission said it was 
satisfied that the National Intelligence Service had had nothing 
to do with the transaction.

  [Text] Rioting former ANC guerrillas, some drunk, 
threatened their commander and stoned ANC cars at a camp near 
Pretoria while the rest of South Africa celebrated Nelson 
Mandela's election win. 
  One of the cars was apparently set on fire and SADF [South 
African Defence Force] troops had to fire warning shots to 
restore order, sources close to the ANC said yesterday. 
  Three of the rioters were said to have been injured by other 
guerrillas helping the army. 
  The riot erupted on Monday night after protests by angry 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] 
members dissatisfied about pay and food at the tented camp. 
  Mandela, in a speech late on Monday marking the ANC's 
election victory, paid tribute to SA's security forces. 
  "We also commend the security forces for the sterling work 
done. This has laid a solid foundation for a truly professional 
security force committed to the service of the people and 
loyalty to the new constitution," he said. 
  About 200 former guerrillas were involved in the riot, which 
was quelled after MK chief-of-staff Siphiwe Nyanda called on 
SADF troops to restore order. 
  "Warning shots were fired in the air to subdue the crowd," 
said one official, who did not wish to be identified. 
  About 4,500 former guerrillas are based at the Wallmannstal 
assembly camp north of Pretoria, ready for integration with 
South African troops in a unified national defence force. 
  Officers at Wallmannstal said about 170 MK members were 
being 
held, most by military police, after the incident. 
  The ANC said it would comment later on the incident. 
  The base's joint operations centre issued a terse statement 
late on Monday saying the unrest was a result of the soldiers' 
complaints about pay and food. 
  "Mr Nyanda, chief-of-staff of the MK contingent of the non- 
statutory element of the South African National Defence Force 
(SANDF), was called to explain the situation to disgruntled 
soldiers. 
  "During the meeting, a small group of drunk troops stoned Mr 
Nyanda's and other MK commanders' cars. Mr Nyanda asked the 
SADF contingent of the SANDF for help to keep order. The 
situation was brought under control and disciplinary action 
would be taken," the statement said. 
  There have been several other similar incidents involving 
ex- 
guerrillas being integrated into joint military structures. 
  The National Peacekeeping Force -- grouping ex-guerrillas, 
former homeland armies, the SADF and SAP [South African Police] 
-- has been given a secondary role in townships after failing to 
stem unrest in the communities it was set up to protect. 
  The peace force was hit by desertions and drunkenness during 
its training and several hundred former guerrillas went on 
strike demanding more pay -- which they got.

  [Text] Potchefstroom May 3 SAPA -- The state of emergency 
imposed on 15 Western Transvaal towns last week was lifted on 
Tuesday [3 May] morning. Deputy regional commissioner of police 
Brig Izak Smalman said the state of emergency declared on April

  [Text] South African arms suppliers are making a bid to 
sell attack helicopters to Britain. They have been invited to 
submit a tender to supply Britain's Royal Air Force with 
Rooivalk [red falcon] choppers, a signal that the arms embargo 
may soon be lifted. Marinus Wijnbeek reports: 
  After about 20 years the second South African Air Force 
flight to Britain, in as many weeks, is preparing to leave from 
Waterkloof Air Force base, and in its hold is Denel's Rooivalk 
attack helicopter. Fitting the large aircraft into Hercules is 
an engineering feat all by itself. Rooivalk will be 
demonstrated at the coming air show at (Middlewallop) in 
Britain. Since December last year the weapons systems have 
undergone intensive tests. The aircraft has a chin- mounted 
canon and it is also fitted with the Kentron ZT-3 antitank 
missile. It is these tank killing properties and its very 
modern technology that resulted in the invitation to submit the 
bid in Britain. The aircraft can operate under all weather 
conditions in virtually any region of the world. Six other 
contenders from the USA and Europe have also entered 
helicopters. If successful 91 Rooivalk aircraft will be 
exported to the UK.

  [Text] Market nervousness at the possibility of a 
two-thirds majority, once final election results are known, has 
contributed to the commercial rand losing more than five cents 
against the dollar. The rand has slipped to nearly 3.605 rands 
against the dollar, a currency which is in short supply on the 
local market. The rand has also lost five cents against 
sterling to 5.42 rands. The financial rand has weakened by 11 
cents to trade at 4.71 rands to the dollar.

<F P=106> [Report by Erica Jankowitz] </F>
  [Text] Most companies questioned in a recent survey were 
not prepared to negotiate an affirmative action policy with 
representative trade unions, and this was likely to be a source 
of serious conflict, industrial relations consultant Larry Palk 
said. 
  Palk's survey of 128 companies throughout SA found that 18 
percent of respondents were not prepared to negotiate 
affirmative action issues. Of these 45 percent would consult a 
union and 36 percent would inform the union of their policies, 
but not discuss the content. 
  "Union involvement is likely to be a source of conflict 
since 
unions have clearly stated that they believe affirmative action 
issues need to be negotiated." 
  Palk's survey found that 95 percent of top management 
positions were held by whites, who also occupied 86 percent of 
middle- management positions and 63 percent of skilled worker 
positions. 
  He warned that it would take many years to change the 
composition of a company's workforce to reflect the labour 
market's racial breakdown, especially at a time when formal 
sector labour turnover stood at between 5 percent and 10 percent. 
  "If this rate of turnover persists, there will not be much 
room to make substantial progress with affirmative action 
without major economic growth. 
  "This could lead to unfulfilled expectations which have been 
heightened in regard to affirmative action." Palk found that 
most progress in implementing affirmative action policies had 
been made in service industries where front-office staff 
interacted with the public. In industries which were task- 
rather than service-oriented, much less had been done, with the 
exception of the oil, chemical, pharmaceutical and food and 
beverage industries. 
  Males dominated top and middle-management posts, but females 
had made inroads into skilled worker categories. This was the 
case in the financial, insurance and banking industry where 
women accounted for 62 percent of skilled workers. Male 
dominance was most pronounced in mining, with men occupying 90 
percent or more of the positions in all three categories. 
  "A minority of companies has shown commitment to affirmative 
action by drawing up a written policy; an even smaller minority 
has communicated this to employees. These findings are rather 
disturbing since there is a high expectation of affirmative 
action taking place."

  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- For the first time since 1964 
a South African delegation has been allowed to take part in the 
international meeting of the World Health Organisation, the 
Department of National Health and Population Development said on 
Tuesday [3 May]. 
  The department said in a statement the delegation was in 
Geneva, Switzerland, where the World Health Assembly began 
meeting on Monday. Health officials from 187 countries are 
attending. 
  "At the opening of the assembly a resolution was submitted 
to 
immediately restore South Africa's voting privileges," said the 
statement. It said the move restored South Africa's full 
participation in the work of the WHO, ensured access to the 
WHO's resources and allowed South Africa to significantly 
contribute to regional public health initiatives.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  De Klerk, Mandela Set Example in Reconciliation -- 
Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 4 May in a page-12 editorial 
says the "overwhelming response" to ANC leader Nelson Mandela's 
election victory speech, and President de Klerk's concession 
speech, on 2 May "has been one of admiration and affection for 
both speakers." Both men "went well beyond the formalities, 
well beyond the expectable courtesies. They created lumps in 
many millions of throats by the earnestness of their goodwill, 
the sincerity of their intentions. They have set an example that 
the country seems well tuned to receive. The emotional turmoil 
of this remarkable period has affected most of us far more 
deeply than we had expected. Now the seeds have been sown by 
Messrs Mandela and De Klerk for a harvest greater than even the 
optimists had expected. They have set an example in 
reconciliation to all of us, and we dare not let them down." 
  Criticism of `Third Force' Generals' Return to Work -- A 
second editorial on the same page notes that two generals 
implicated in "third force" activities, were back at work this 
week "in an extraordinary, inexplicable and unacceptable move 
that demands the fullest explanation." Six weeks ago the 
Goldstone Commission found there was prima facie evidence that 
they were involved in, and "probably masterminded, a Third 
Force." Now Police Commissioner Johan van der Merwe, after 
consulting the Transvaal Attorney- General, ordered the two, 
Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux, to return to work because 
"there were `no grounds' for their continued absence." THE STAR 
disagrees with this decision. "The generals have been accused 
in public and until they are cleared in public they should not 
be allowed back in control of the police. Both justice and 
their own reputations demand this." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Lack of Security for Mandela -- Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in 
English on 4 May in a page-10 editorial says: "Mandela's 
enthusiasm at the ANC victory party this week was 
understandable, as was his desire to celebrate with crowds in 
the streets, but it did not make him any safer. Nor did the 
lack of security surrounding the country's next head of state." 
"Tight security will keep him further from the people than he 
would like, but it is an inevitable feature of a world in which 
presidents are no safer than prime ministers, princes or popes. 
And when he finds it irksome, Mandela can remind himself that 
his job is to protect this country's assets. He features too 
high on that list to go dancing in the streets, no matter how 
jubilant he feels." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Tribute to Mandela, De Klerk, Buthelezi, Viljoen -- 
Referring 
to the "explosion of joy and excitement in the streets of the 
townships and in suburbs" following Nelson Mandela's election 
victory speech, Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 4 May in a 
page-6 editorial says: "While it is easy in today's world for 
things to get out of hand and for violence to explode into 
action, most people are held back by the awe and respect they 
have for Mandela." SOWETAN also praises President de Klerk "for 
the role he has played in this drama. It was De Klerk's courage 
that eventually led to the events of this day. It was a courage 
in the face of hate and abuse from his own people and his act on 
February 2 1990 will be recorded by history as the turning point 
towards a democratic majority government in South Africa." 
SOWETAN also notes Inkatha leader Buthelezi's "undeniable" 
"control on his people and area." Buthelezi has received 
sufficient votes "to show he has a place in the hearts of the 
people of South Africa." Finally, tribute goes to Freedom Front 
leader Constand Viljoen who "could have been influenced by the 
radicals among Afrikaners to violence," but who "wisely" chose 
the path of negotiation. 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Election Outcome Fair Reflection of Electorate Desire -- 
Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 2 May notes in a page-8 
editorial: "South Africans' rising and other activities today 
will take place with the overwhelming knowledge that, by all 
indications, Mr.Nelson Mandela, the leader of the ANC, has been 
chosen president in the first representative election in South 
Africa. We write this in the midst of efforts to obtain a 
result from of the vote-counting chaos," but "everything points 
to Mr. Mandela having completed his long march to freedom." 
"Through the election the country has arrived at the future 
which, due to racism and conflicting nationalisms, so long 
evaded it. Some would no doubt wish that they could enter a 
time machine to escape the significance of 2 May 1994. There are 
some to the right who are mentally moving into the laager, while 
others threaten war," but "the election has shown that they 
represent a tiny minority." "The election was the final 
irreversible step. South Africa can never be the same again. 
Despite tremendous, even shocking shortcomings in the 
administration of the election, we believe that the outcome is a 
fair reflection of the will of the electorate, and therefore 
South Africa now has a representative and fully legitimate 
government." "We identify fully with the new reality of South 
Africa." "Our best wishes go to the ANC which received a clear 
mandate from the voters. There are aspects of its leadership 
and policy which worry us, and we will oppose these by 
highlighting the better options. We wish Mr. Mandela good luck, 
and hope he will be blessed with wisdom and grace to lead the 
country away from the abysses of the past. It will depend on 
him to what extent the government of national unity and the 
philosophy of reconciliation can gain stature and produce 
tangible results. We also wish the National Party strength; an 
important portion of the electorate placed their trust in it. 
BEELD enters the new dispensation as a watchdog which will try 
to serve the cause of democracy and freedom from a position of 
loyalty to the country."

  [Text] We have just heard that the first session of the 
National Assembly will only take place next Monday [9 May] in 
Cape Town and not, as initially planned, on the 6 May. The 
Transitional Executive Council's management committee has 
decided that the first meeting of the provincial legislature 
will be held on Saturday, 7 May, at various meeting points. 
This decision by the management committee was taken on the 
basis of information received by the Independent Electoral 
Commission. The change of date will not affect the inauguration 
ceremony for the state president at the Union Buildings in 
Pretoria on Tuesday, 10 May.

  [Text] Pretoria May 3 SAPA -- State President-Designate 
Nelson Mandela will be sworn in at a ceremony at the Union 
Buildings in Pretoria on Tuesday [10 May] next. Representatives 
of more than 100 countries will attend. 
  At a press conference on Tuesday, National Inauguration 
Committee Spokesman Patrick Evans said 188 invitations had been 
sent to foreign governments. Forty-two of these had replied 
that their countries would be represented by heads of state. 
  Three heads of government would attend and the other 
countries would be represented by high-ranking representatives. 
In all, 188 invitations had been sent for foreign governments. 
He described the inauguration as "the largest gathering of 
heads of state in the world". 
  Among the dignitaries expected are United States 
Vice-President Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, wife of American 
President Bill Clinton. Former Australian Prime Ministers 
Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke will represent that country. His 
Royal Highness Prince Philip will represent the United Kingdom. 
  The committee released a draft programme of the day's 
events. 
On Friday this week the National Assembly will be convened in 
Cape Town by Chief Justice Mr Justice Michael Corbett. The 
president will then be elected by members of the National 
Assembly. Later on Friday Mr Mandela will address a crowd at 
Cape Town's Grand Parade and visit a mosque at Bo-Kaap. 
  On Saturday, Mr Mandela has a single engagement at the Sea 
Point synagogue for the sabbath service. 
  On Sunday he will attend an interdenominational service at 
Soccer City in Soweto, organised by the South African Council of 
Churches. 
  On Monday, Mr Mandela will attend a banquet hosted by 
Pretoria Mayor Mr N. J. van der M. Stofberg at Pretoria City 
Hall. 
  Foreign dignitaries will arrive during the course of Monday 
and on Tuesday morning. The inauguration at the Union Buildings 
will be attended by the dignitaries, the media, security 
services and ticket holders for the Botha Lawn in front of the 
Union Buildings. 
  Festivities will be led by 3,000 performers, 300 sangomas 
[traditional healers] and 100 African drummers. The 2-1/2 hour 
"Many Cultures -- One Nation" inauguration concert will be 
televised live. As many as one billion people around the world 
will be able to watch the festivities on television. 
  The Transvaal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Soweto String 
Quartet and Africa Muse will provide music. The concert 
includes performers such as Johnny Clegg, Ladysmith Black 
Mambazo and Mango Groove. Narrators include Nadine Gordimer, 
Adam Small, Andre Brink and Mzwakhe Mbuli. 
  Mr Mandela will arrive at the Union Buildings' amphitheatre 
at 11 AM and will make his inauguration speech soon after being 
sworn in by Mr Justice Corbett. He will address the public at 
the Botha Lawn at 11.45 [AM]. 
  Security will be tight and people without tickets or passes 
will not be admitted. The area about five blocks around the 
Union Buildings will be cordoned off. Workers were putting the 
finishing touches to seating and other arrangements at the Union 
Buildings on Tuesday. 
  Inside, President F. W. de Klerk and Mr Mandela were meeting 
to dicuss a wide range of issues. Unlike on previous occasions, 
the two men made it known they would not be seeing or talking to 
the press after their meeting which was described as "private".

  [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- Intimidation was the main 
basis of complaints made to the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] during last week's elections, according to figures 
released on Wednesday [4 May]. An IEC statement said a total of 
3,586 complaints had been made to it up to Friday with the 
highest number, 1,011, claiming intimidation. 
  The complaints included 540 involving problems with voting 
procedures, 168 involving violence "against people in electoral 
process" and 147 of violence against property. There were also 
146 complaints about the public holiday on April 27. 
  Of the 3,586 complaints, investigations were continuing into 
776 and 2,810 were regarded as closed. 
  Of the closed cases, 177 had been referred to the police, 52 
referred to courts, 594 were regarded as without substance and 
273 had been referred to mediation. Of these, 170 had been 
successfully mediated, in 26 cases mediation had failed and 
mediation was continuing in 77 instances. 
  The African National Congress topped the list of both party 
complainants and respondents. The ANC made 520 complaints and 
was cited as respondent in 646. 
  The highest number of complaints was 1,721 made by 
individuals. The IEC said this number, 48 per cent of the total, 
was "significant as an indicator of the involvement of the 
general public in the electoral process".

Constitution Commission. The Council decided that certain 
controversial items like the property rights and rights of 
self-determination up to secession are to appear before the 
Constituent Assembly for final decision. The amended document

  [Text] [Announcer Jeremy Dawes] The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] has just discovered another major hitch in the 
counting process. IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler has just 
announced that the computer system used to calculate the results 
has been tampered with. Anton Fisher is at IEC headquarters in 
Kruis Street. Anton, the story please: 
  [Fisher] Jeremy, what happened was that there were 
noticeable 
inconsistencies between the tallies received from the counting 
stations and the number of votes being put out by the computer, 
so what happened was that, according to Judge Kriegler, it 
appears that the computer program used here by the IEC had been 
tampered with, to such an extent that certain parties were being 
consistently favored, were getting more votes all the time, and 
that is the gist of the kind of tampering that is now being 
discovered. 
  [Dawes] Are they going to disclose, or has it been 
disclosed, 
how many votes have been affected? 
  [Fisher] Well, Judge Kriegler was questioned on that and 
according to him it's quite an insignificant amount, but he did 
concede that it could amount to tens of thousands of votes in 
the 12 million that had been counted up to yesterday morning. 
  [Dawes] They can't identify which particular areas are going 
to be affected? 
  [Fisher] No, but it's on a party basis. Certain particular 
parties are being favored by this fault in the program which has 
been discovered, and he wouldn't name which parties either. 
  [Dawes] So, what is Judge Kriegler going to do now to follow 
this up? 
  [Fisher] Well, apparently the monitoring directorate of the 
IEC has started an investigation. What they have done also is 
called in the help of two outside computer experts, and they are 
now continuing the investigation and apparently the matter will 
be referred to the police. 
  [Dawes] Have the party leaders been informed and are they 
going to react to the this? 
  [Fisher] Apparently, there has been communication between 
the 
parties, you know, all parties at the party liaison committee.

  [Text] Johannebsurg May 4 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] will resume issuing vote tallies within little 
more than an hour -- about 7 PM -- IEC Chairman Justice Johann 
Kriegler said on Wednesday [4 May] afternoon. He explained to 
the media that results had been stopped after "pollution" of the 
data was discovered shortly after 6 AM on Tuesday. 
  The results would now be issued from a second, slower, 
manually-fed back-up system which he claimed was free of these 
errors. Mr Kriegler said a team of computer experts had been 
called in to investigate the problem and that it was not known 
who was responsible for the computer interference. 
Investigations were continuing. 
  All vote counting, barring that in Empangeni, had been 
completed and the latter would be finished within hours. Judge 
Kriegler was supported by his deputy, Mr Dikgang Moseneke, and 
Commissioner Ben van der Ross. They said Natal results would 
reach the IEC headquarters in a "usable format" no later than 7 
PM on Wednesday. 
  "All disputes have been resolved at Durban Expo and we can 
now deal with the final tallies," Mr van der Ross said. When 
the result issue was resumed the manual tallies would take over 
from those issued from the computerised system. 
  Judge Kriegler said the new totals would be "more or less 
slightly higher" than those already issued with a slight 
fluctuation in results for particular parties. In a lengthy 
explanation of the "pollution", Judge Kriegler avoided using the 
word mistake and became, as he put it, "disconcerted by the 
implication (of questioners) that I am not being truthful." 
  On Tuesday the slow pace of results had prompted an attempt 
to change systems to issue totals rather than batches. When 
this proved very much slower, and after closing down the data 
receiving system, "the suspicion arose that some of the 
information may be polluted", he said. 
  Investigations started immediately while the manually fed 
monitoring system became the main recording system. "None of 
the suspect material was loaded onto the monitoring system. It 
is not suspect, even now." 
  The judge did not tell the media what the euphemism "suspect 
material" or "pollution" meant in real terms. The problem, he 
said, had been discovered due to trivial differences which 
continually occurred between two independent data control 
systems which had specifically been set up to provide 
independent verification of the results. 
  "Extraordinary measures are being taken to ensure the 
integrity of results on the manual system is as trustworthy as 
human precautions can make them," he said. He could not give a 
definite time when the final results would be announced. "But 
we in the commission are acutely aware, as you are, of the 
inauguration and of the (preceeding) sessions of the provincial 
and national assemblies. 
  "We will take as long as the law allows us to do the job as 
thoroughly as we can. We are doing everything in our power to 
ensure that there is no disruption and I am confident we will be 
able to do so," Judge Kriegler said.

<F P=106> [Interview with IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler and Deputy </F>
Chairman Dikgang Moseneke by correspondent Leslie Mashokwe in 
the Johannesburg studio on the "Newsline" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] The IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] has been masterminding the country's first-ever 
all-race elections. The task has been a mammoth one. What 
usually takes other countries four and a half years to organize 
had to be completed in just four months. Inevitably, then, 
there had to be problems, and problems there were. In the 
studio with me is Judge Johann Kriegler and Advocate Dikgang 
Moseneke from the IEC. Good evening, gentlemen, and welcome. 
How far are we from getting the final results? 
  [Kriegler] As near as we can possibly be, and as short as 
possible. 
  [Nashokwe] Timeframe? 
  [Kriegler] We've never been prepared to commit ourselves to 
a 
time frame. As long as it takes to do it legitimately and 
thoroughly. 
  [Mashokwe] Two days? Three days? 
  [Kriegler] We've never been prepared to commit ourselves to 
a 
timeframe. We'll take as long as it takes to do it so that the 
people are satisfied that we've done it. 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, what it is that the IEC has 
done wrongly? The country is waiting. 
  [Moseneke] Well, let me tell you what I'm prepared to say. 
The judge has said a little less, and guardedly so. I want to 
say to the people out there that we're working around the clock. 
Remember, we're getting results coming through from all 
quarters of our country. We're getting results from the north 
end of Natal such as Jozini, to the southernmost parts of this 
country. From the northern Cape, from wherever else you can 
think of. Whereas in the past elections were decentralized, the 
results came from constituencies, now they have to come to one 
central point and be allocated to all the parties, and there are 
many, as you know. So we have made sure that everything comes 
to the center, and once it is here at the center, we have to 
allocate the results. I want to leave much more hope out there 
at home. What I'm going to say to you is, that results will be 
out in a way that will not affect... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] When? 
  [Moseneke] Listen to me, listen to me. The results will be 
out in a way that will not affect the presidential inauguration 
on Monday, which must, as you know, be preceeded by the sitting 
of the National Assembly on Monday...I'm sorry, let me correct 
that -- the presidential inauguration is on Tuesday the 10th, 
National Assembly will sit on Monday the 9th. The provincial 
assemblies may sit on Saturday, and clearly -- now you should 
use your common sense -- we're going to make sure that results 
are there avaialble to keep all these processes in place. 
  [Mashokwe] What was the delay all about? 
  [Moseneke] Well, let me tell you. You know that Natal has 
just finished counting. Now the parties out there are present, 
they have to make sure that they go through the processes and 
they are bickering among themselves, and we have to allow that 
whole process. Do you know that at Nasrec [exhibition center] 
the results have actually just come through in the course of 
this early evening? Big voting station, over 34 counting 
stations. We're to allow the parties to debate the issues, to 
make the tallies, and we still have to reconcile them. Think 
about that. 
  [Moseneke] Did you not have a problem with the computer, 
Judge Kriegler? 
  [Kriegler] We had a problem with the computer, and the 
problem was that we were trying to keep the people happy. 
Instead of just going for totals, we tried to feed into the 
media 3,000 votes at a time from each counting station, and this 
complicated the issue to a much greater extent than we had 
anticipated. 
  [Mashokwe] For about 20 minutes, the report says, somebody 
must have fiddled with your computer. How could that have been 
possible and what kind of fiddling are we talking about? Who is 
affected? Which parties are affected by this? 
  [Kriegler] I'm not at liberty to disclose that. I think it 
would be unfair to the parties... 
  [Mashokwe] But are there parties that have been affected? 
  [Kriegler] There are parties that were temporarily affected 
until shortly afterwards. We picked it up. 
  [Moseneke] It is important, I think, to support the judge 
there, and to say almost instantly our computer experts were 
quite sharp, were able to determine the difficultes in a very 
short space of time, just a matter of hours, and I want to say 
to you that the integrity of most of the figures, of the 
results, have not been tampered with. They are entirely intact. 
You will see as and when the results move on, you'll notice 
that the changes are very slight, and, you know, these changes 
are limited to just a few parties. So in that way there is no 
reason for concern whatsoever. What is important is that the 
IEC once again has managed to detect the problem, and to solve 
it. 
  [Mashokwe] The leaders have already accepted defeat and 
others have made victory statements, and yet you're talking 
about provincial tallies. Is the integrity of the result not 
going to be questioned by the delays that you're causing? By 
the fact that you're not able to deliver the final package? 
We've had so many problems... 
  [Kriegler] Let's get this one clear. From the beginning we 
were given 10 days to get the results out. That's the time at 
our disposal. It's always been... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] You're not dragging your feet 
because you have 10 days? 
  [Kriegler] Not on your life. We've made it clear from the 
beginning, it's going to take time. Let me add, you know, it's 
not just doing a bit of simple arithmetic. There are a very 
large number of objections and complaints that we've got to deal 
with, and we're dealing with those as efficiently and as quickly 
and as fairly as is humanly possible. There are thousands of 
complaints that have got to be dealt with. 
  [Mashokwe] Talking about complaints, Judge Kriegler, the 
dispute from KwaZulu-Natal, ANC blaming it on the IFP [Inkatha 
Freedom Party], the IFP also countering. Has this been sorted 
out? 
  [Kriegler] The complaints as such? Some of the disputes have 
been sorted out at the correct level, namely, by the parties 
concerned. Yes. Some of them certainly do remain, in fact a 
substantial number still remain for us to determine, if 
necessary. 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, give me your understanding of 
an unfree and unfair election, taking into consideration the 
scenario we've been through, with all the problems we've gone 
through. 
  [Moseneke] Well, I don't think we should exaggerate the 
problems. I think we should remember one important 
characteristic of free and fair elections... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Unfree and unfair. 
  [Moseneke] You want an unfree and an unfair one? Well, I 
could tell you what is free and fair, and you can make the 
deduction if you will. My job is to deliver a free and fair 
election. Now look, obviously if not everybody is allowed or 
given the opportunity to cast a vote, that would go to the heart 
of the matter. If there would be no fairness, in regard to 
treatment of the parties -- all have to be given equal 
opportunity and equal chance in the process. Ideally you'd want 
to have informed voters, and if the bulk of your votes are not 
informed, they probably would be affected in their choices. A 
matter about which not much can always be done; and you'd want 
to hope that all the parties, all the people voting, would not 
be subjected to intimidation, to violence, to any threat of 
future adverse consequences. And the results must be properly 
determined and made known publicly. 
  [Mashokwe] Some of the problems that you've had here, like 
the shortage of ballot boxes -- a million somewhere in 
warehouses -- are the kind of problems that one would say your 
administration will have detected, at least if you were 
efficient. 
  [Kriegler] You give us four years, and we'll do that. And 
let me tell you, the next time round it will be much better. 
Let's make one point clear. A first-time election is always 
difficult, even in a small country. We're a large country, and 
it was exceedingly difficult, and we never made any bones about 
that. And particularly, I want to add to what my friend Dikgang 
said. Part of fairness is that it is perceived and felt by the 
people as being their election. You've got to involve the 
people in the business of the election, and that means you've 
got to involve people who haven't had experience.... 
  [Mashokwe] Advocate Moseneke, what is it that you would have 
done differently if you were to be given the same task again? 
  [Moseneke] Well, there are a few things. The first of these 
would be, I hope we will have a voter registration. A roll is 
critical, it's essential. It's the basis of your planning. 
You'll realize that there was no voters' roll. You never could 
accurately determine how many people were there in the country. 
It affects where you place your voting stations. The second 
thing is, I think the preparations for the next elections should 
start now. I think you need several years. You don't need four 
months. Perhaps let me stop immediately to say, I think it is a 
near miracle what we have achieved. In four months when we were 
appointed, not even a chair we had. From the very beginning, 
right through to what you are looking at now, you have the 
results, you're having a new president, you're having a 
democracy at your doorstep. We made all that possible. We've 
employed over, what, 300, 400 [figure as heard] South Africans, 
and got them out there to do the job themselves. So as and 
when.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] And then to leave us with the 
burden 
of all these problems that.... 
  [Moseneke, interrupting] No, no, no, not at all. We've 
delivered to you an election which substantially had all the 
features that allowed our people to be able to make choices. 
You must not confuse exaggerated statements that are made all 
the time with the substance of the task. Ordinary South 
Africans went out there to count the votes. They conducted the 
elections. You saw them, as monitors. It was a people's 
election. They went out there to do it -- not perfectly, but 
still, they did it, and next time around it must be better. I'm 
sure it will be better. 
  [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, final result? Are you prepared to 
give us an indication? 
  [Kriegler] In good time for the presidential inauguration 
and 
as soon as it is ready. 
  [Mashokwe] Judge Kriegler, Advocate Dikgang Moseneke, thanks 
for your time, and thanks for talking to us.

Johann Kriegler in the Johannesburg studio by announcer Max du 
Preez in the Cape Town parliamentary studio, on the "Agenda" 
program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Du Preez] Judge Kriegler, can 
I ask you: Was there sabotage of the election and of the 
election campaign? We hear of millions of ballot papers 
disappearing and we have just heard about a computer program 
being tampered with. Was there sabotage? 
  [Kriegler] Concerning the distribution aspect I would rather 
keep an open mind. The case is being investigated and there are 
signs indicating sabotage, but at this stage, in my opinion, 
these allegations are not strong enough to base a decision on. 
Concerning the computer -- that was undoubtedly sabotage. It 
was not accidental, the fact that early yesterday morning during 
a specified period, certain false data was fed into the 
computer. [passage omitted]

  [Text] With just over 66 percent of the provisional 
national votes now known, the ANC will be the dominating party 
in the National Assembly with 251 seats, compared with the NP 
[National Party] with 88, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] with 
34, and the Freedom Front [FF] with 11 seats. The DP 
[Democratic Party] should have seven seats, the PAC 
[Pan-Africanist Congress] six, the African Christian Democratic 
Party [ACDP] two, and the African Moderates Congress Party 
[AMCP] one seat. This means that eight parties could take their 
seats in the National Assembly. Until now none of the other 
smaller parties has obtained enough support for a seat in the 
assembly. According to the latest provisional results the ANC 
has 64.8 percent of the national vote, compared with the NP's 
20.5 percent.

  [Excerpts] The flow of election results resumed early this 
morning after a 32-hour delay caused by sabotage to the computer 
system. The latest results show that with more than 15 million 
votes counted, the African National Congress is just 1.7 percent 
away from wining a two-thirds majority. The ANC has 64.9 
percent, while the National Party [NP] is perilously close to 
the 20 percent cutoff mark required to capture a deputy 
president position with 20.5 percent. The IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] is still third with 8.1 percent. The IEC [Independent 
Electoral Commission] said of the 15,054,768 received from 
throughout the country, 14,893,634 have been accepted. [passage 
omitted] 
  This is how the picture looks for the first two parties 
according the provisional polling percentages for each 
provincial legislature: In the Orange Free State (OFS) the ANC 
has 76.9 percent of the votes, and the NP 12.3 percent; in North 
West the ANC has 83.8 percent and the NP 8.6 percent; in 
KwaZulu/ Natal the IFP has 57.1 percent of the votes against the 
ANC's 28.6 percent; in the Eastern Transvaal the ANC has 81.8 
and the NP 8.4 percent; in the Northern Transvaal 91.6 percent 
for the ANC and the NP 3.3 percent; in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region the ANC has 57.9 percent 
against the NP's 24 percent; in the Eastern Cape the ANC has 
81.2 percent, and the NP 12.2 percent; in the Western Cape NP 
has 53.3 percent, and the ANC 33.1 percent; and in the Northern 
Cape the ANC has 49.9 percent, and the NP 40.4 percent. 
  The provisional results were received this morning after it 
was discovered on Tuesday morning that someone had interfered 
with the IEC's computer systems. The results are now being fed 
in and analyzed at a slower rate. A team of computer experts is 
investigating the problem. It is not yet known who the culprit 
was.

  [Text] The election battle in the Northern Cape appears to 
be heading for an interesting finish with both the ANC and the 
opposition parties having won 15 seats each in the provincial

provisional results available, the ANC has won 49.8 percent, the 
NP [National Party] 40.3 percent, the Freedom Front 5.9 percent, 
and the DP [Democratic Party] 1.8 percent. This means 12 seats 
for the NP, two for the Freedom Front, and one for the DP.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress on Wednesday [4 May] night strongly denied it had 
withdrawn charges of electoral fraud against the Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  The organisation's secretary general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, 
issued the denial barely two hours after IFP leader Chief 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had learnt that the ANC had 
withdrawn these charges. Stressing the anc's commitment to 
accept the results of a free and fair election, Mr Ramaphosa 
said his organisation had presented new evidence of irregularity 
to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). "The ANC has new 
evidence that it has submitted to the IEC, further strengthening 
its case on the irregularities in KwaZulu/Natal. It is the firm 
hope of the ANC that outstanding problems contributing to the 
delay in counting will be speedily resolved to allow the country 
to embark on the many tasks awaiting the government of national 
unity." 
  Earlier, IEC spokesman Mr Glenn McDougall confirmed the 
commission had found no evidence of extensive voting fraud in 
KwaZulu/Natal, as claimed by the ANC.

  [Text] An IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] 
investigation into allegations of mass fraud in some districts 
of KwaZulu-Natal has held up the tallying process. With no 
substantial results available from this region it's not yet 
clear whether Saturday's inauguration ceremony for the region's 
premier can go ahead. Ida Jooste has the story. 
  [Begin recording] [Jooste] Speculation is mounting over 
whether the ANC or IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] will take control 
of KwaZulu-Natal. An urgent meeting was held behind closed 
doors at a counting station in Durban today to address 
allegations of fraud. Hours later and IEC commissioner and party 
officials emerged to announce that there had been some 
agreement. However, the issue of about 80 disputed boxes from 
the Mahlabatini area remains unresolved. 
  [IFP spokesman Ziba Jiyane] More than a hundred boxes have 
been held up here because somebody from the ANC identified their 
origin as the IFP stronghold, and we brought Mr. Nupin to come 
here. I took my time out here with Mr. Miller and now when we 
make a case to Mr. Nupin the ANC decides to call us aside and 
say they are withdrawing all that -- because they knew they were 
frivolous claims. 
  [ANC spokesman Beki Cele] One serious thing that happened is 
to give the officials of KwaZulu to run some stations. The 
officials of KwaZulu would be the IFP people or would have some 
kind of (?allegiance). I think that was a serious shortcoming 
from the very word go, and it has...[pauses] it was bound to 
snowball. 
  [IEC Commissioner Charles Nupin] The second category were 
boxes that on the face of it could not be reconciled to 
particular voting stations. Now, my information is that an 
investigation was conducted and in the large majority of cases 
those boxes were reconciled to particular voting stations. [end

  [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangusuthu Buthelezi 
says he had never tried to have two options with regard to the 
acceptance of the election resutls, but that his reservations 
were centered around allegations of irregularities during the 
election. He spoke to our correspondent at Ulundi today. 
  [Begin Buthelexi recording] When we went to the elections, 
it 
was under the understanding that we would accept the results of 
the elections, and the only reservation that I had was because 
of all the irregularities that were taking place, that made me 
reserve my position and say that, you know, well, let's wait and 
see what the outcome is. But I don't think that there's any 
possibility that I could turn around and say that I don't accept 
the results of the elections, if everyone else accepts them.

  "We believe that favorable prospects are opening up for the

  [Text] Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro has 
sent a message to Nelson Mandela, president of the African 
National Congress, noting his recent victory in the South 
African general elections, where he won the presidency by a wide 
margin. 
  These elections, the first ones held with the complete 
participation of the population, constitute an event of 
significant importance because they mark the beginning of a new 
era in the political history of South Africa, where the majority 
of the population was repressed by the shameful apartheid regime 
of racial segregation, the message sent by President Chamorro 
said. 
  The Nicaraguan Government, firmly committed to the promotion 
of democratic and human rights, is pleased to salute the efforts 
by the various South African political sectors which made 
changes in that country possible, the Nicaraguan Government note 
observed.

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Rawlings, has sent 
a message of congratulations to the ANC on winning South 
Africa's first all-race elections. The message to the ANC 
president, Mr. Mandela, said: Your resounding victory is a 
victory for all South Africans who, for decades, have valiantly 
struggled against the evil forces of apartheid and racism. It 
is also a victory for all Africans on the continent and in the 
diaspora and progressive forces around the world who have stood 
resolutely by the majority of South Africans throughout the long 
and difficult days of their struggle. 
  The message said the ANC's victory vindicates the justness 
of 
the struggle for the eradication of apartheid and racism from 
the African Continent. It expressed the hope that Mr. Mandela's 
administration will find strength and wisdom to bring to 
fruition the noble aspirations of the majority of South Africans 
both black and white.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by President Alpha Oumar Konare in Bamako; </F>
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Mali, like the entire 
international community, is very satisfied with the ANC's 
victory in the South Africa elections. These elections, which 
are the result of struggle, sufferings, and sacrifices, has put 
an end to apartheid which had turned racial discrimination into 
a system of government. These elections represent an important 
link on the path to national reconciliation and the advent of a 
united, non-racial, and democratic South Africa. These 
elections also constitute an obvious achievement for the 
stability, solidarity, and cooperation in the southern subregion 
of the continent, and at the same time open new prospects for 
cooperation between South Africa and the rest of Africa. 
  Mali is happy about the advent of majority rule and pays 
tribute to all the pioneers of the struggle against apartheid 
who made enormous sacrifices for the principle of one man one 
vote to prevail. Mali hails the great work accomplished by the 
South African people to make this day a reality. It assures 
them of its friendship [words indistinct]. Finally, Mali 
considers that nothing should henceforth oppose the 
establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of 
South Africa and the Republic of Mali.

  [Text] Dakar, 3 May (AFP) -- Senegalese President Abdou 
Diouf today expressed satisfaction with "the decisive step that 
the struggle against apartheid has taken" with the first 
nonracial elections in South Africa and the victory of the 
African National Congress led by Nelson Mandela. 
  In a communique issued at the end of the cabinet meeting 
today, President Abdou Diouf stressed "his full joy at seeing 
the decisive step that the struggle against apartheid has taken 
with the general elections that just took place democratically 
in South Africa." 
  Senegal and South Africa "opened representation bureaus" in 
Dakar and Pretoria on 26 January. "The two bureaus will soon be 
promoted to the rank of embassies, probably after the 
elections," the Senegalese Government said.

  [Excerpt] President Yoweri Museveni has congratulated the 
people of South Africa, the ANC, and Mr. Nelson Mandela, in 
particular, on their recent victory in the elections which have 
ended the inhumane system of apartheid. The president was 
addressing a crowd which gathered at the parliamentary buildings 
in Kampala today to celebrate the end of apartheid in South 
Africa. Mr. Museveni said that it is a great achievement to see 
that this sad chapter in human history has come to an end. He 
also congratulated Mr. de Klerk for changing his mind from his 
original stand and join the people of South Africa in the move 
toward this new chapter. 
  Mr. Museveni paid tribute to the people of South Africa who 
sacrificed a great deal in the struggle for freedom. He singled 
out Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, (Subukwe) among others as 
people who refused to surrender their right to freedom despite 
the terrible hardships they went through. He also paid tribute 
to African leaders who made significant contributions to the 
freedom struggle, whom he enumerated as Julius Nyerere, Kenneth 
Kaunda, Samora Machel, Kwame Nkrumah, 'Abd-al-Nasir, Ben Bella, 
Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, Sekou Toure, and Robert Mugabe. Mr. 
Museveni said that with this new chapter in South Africa, Africa 
is now free from the Cape to Cairo. He cautioned, however, that 
Africa is only free in the broad-based sense, because there are 
still many problems to solve, such as the present conflicts in 
Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, and Angola. He also pointed out 
that the combined gross domestic product of South Africa, East 
Africa, and Nigeria is still smaller than the gross domestic 
product of a small country like Belgium. 
  The president, who acknowledged the presence of ANC soldiers 
at the celebrations, said that since the National Resistance 
Movement came to government in 1986, it has given assistance to 
the ANC in line with the OAU policy. This assistance culminated 
in the receiving of ANC soldiers in Uganda after they were 
forced to leave Angola in order to pave the way for the 
independence of Namibia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Uganda has welcomed the triumph of the ANC led by 
Nelson Mandela in the first all-race elections in South Africa. 
A statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
Kampala today stressed that the success of the ANC is not only a 
victory for one party alone but for all the 19 parties which 
participated in the elections, as well as the people of Africa 
who believe in equality, justice, and democracy. 
  The people of Uganda, the statement says, are proud to have 
been associated with the liberation struggle in South Africa 
through their moral, political, and material support. The 
statement adds that the people of Uganda salute president de 
Klerk for his steadfastness and courage amid threats, not only 
in organizing and ensuring free and fair elections but conceding 
defeat in a statesmanlike manner and agreeing to hand over power 
to the winner. We are deeply confident, the statement goes on, 
that the new South Africa under the leadership of the 
president-elect, Nelson Mandela, his ANC, and all other 
peace-loving people in that country will erect an unshakeable 
foundation on which peace, freedom, and unity will be built. 
Uganda, the statement concludes, welcomes the new nation of 
South Africa to its rightful place among the international 
community and looks forward to many years of mutual and friendly 
cooperation in all fields of common endeavor in order to make 
the world a safer and more prosperous place to live in.

  [Text] Cape Town May 5 SAPA -- Hernus Kriel's easy smile, 
twinkling eyes and verligte [enlightened] image disguise a tough 
and experienced politician, a man who since August 1991 has been 
handling what is probably the most difficult and controversial 
portfolio in the De Klerk cabinet -- that of law and order. 
  Kriel was born in Kakamas on November 14, 1941, and moved 
with his family to Wellington in 1947 where he started and 
completed his schooling. 
  He obtained a BA and LLB from the University of Stellenbosch 
in 1964, and the following year took a job as public prosecutor 
in Bellville. 
  In 1968, after completing his articles, he established his 
own law practice in Parow, and in 1978 entered the business 
world by establishing a mining company. He sold his interests 
in the company in 1980, when he started practicing as an 
advocate. 
  Kriel was elected to the Cape Divisional Council in 1974 as 
representative for Parow. In 1976 he was elected the 
youngest-ever chairman of the council, and served on the 
executive of the Association of Divisional Councils and on the 
United Municipal Executive. 
  In the 1977 general election he was elected unopposed to the 
provincial council, and in 1981, after being re-elected 
unopposed, he was appointed to the province's executive 
committee in the local government portfolio. 
  In a 1984 by-election Kriel became MP for Parow. 
  In September 1989 president FW de Klerk appointed him 
minister of planning and provincial affairs, to which national 
housing was later added. He also served as minister of local 
government in the Ministers' Council of the House of Assembly. 
  In this portfolio Kriel was deeply involved with land reform 
and squatter issues. Under him, the separate Amenities and 
Group Areas Acts were scrapped, and controversy flared over the 
Residential Environment Bill, aimed at beefing up control over 
residential norms and standards, which was to have come in the 
wake of group areas. The bill was eventually dropped. 
  Earlier, Kriel had reportedly said in a conversation with 
journalists that if black people wanted to bargain with the NP 
[National Party] for the scrapping of the Group Areas Act, they 
had to be prepared to give up something equally dear in their 
own culture -- and he mentioned the lobola [dowry] system as an 
example. 
  He is also reported to have said he believes former Premier 
John Vorster is the father of political reform in South Africa. 
  In June 1991 Kriel announced that fast reaction "squatter 
auxiliary units" were to be set up by the provincial 
administrations in cooperation with the police to deal with 
suspected squatting. 
  On August 31 1991 he was sworn in as minister of law and 
order in place of Adriaan Vlok, who was sidelined to the 
correctional services portfolio after revelations that police 
had funded an Inkatha rally. 
  Kriel immediately pledged himself to restoring the SAP's 
[South African Police] image as an unbiased non-partisan force. 
  In March 1992, announcing a comprehensive anti-crime 
strategy, he said the government was "deadly serious" about 
clamping down on lawlessness. 
  The strategy included the formation of an Internal Stability 
Division which would eventually be four times the size of its 
predecessor the Riot Squad and boosting the 94,000 strong police 
force by almost 16,000 new recruits. 
  In May that year Kriel joined the government's Codesa 
[Convention for a Democratic South Africa] team, and 
subsequently became a leading and tough-talking government 
spokesman on negotiations. 
  As political head of the police, Kriel has had to deal with 
criticisms of police conduct in the Trust Feeds and Boipatong 
killings, and with claims by Pathologist Dr Jonathan Gluckman of 
large scale killings of prisoners in police custody. 
  In August 1992, after the compilation of the Waddington 
Report on Boipatong, he said 18 police generals would take early 
retirement, and admitted that a racist policy in the force had 
thus far prevented black officers from reaching the general 
staff. He announced the immediate promotion of officers who had 
been discriminated against in the past. 
  Kriel and his wife Juliette were divorced in 1993. They had 
two daughters and a son.

  [Text] Bloemfontein May 5 SAPA -- The new leader of the 
Northern Cape, Manne Emsley Dipico, is a dynamic young unionist 
who faces a strong regional opposition and possible hung 
parliament in South Africa's largest but most sparsely populated 
area. The youngest regional premier, Dipico, 35, is described 
by colleagues as an extremely vibrant and hardworking leader who 
spends up to 7 days a week in the office. 
  He endorses Afrikaans as an official language for the 
Northern Cape, and wants whites and their skills to play an 
important role in its new government and mining- and 
agriculture-based economy. 
  In a region with a 70 per cent illiteracy rate and years of 
underdevelopment, Dipico faces massive challenges in education, 
healthcare and unemployment. A decision also has to be taken on 
whether to keep the capital in Kimberley or move it to Upington, 
understood to be the preference of strong lobbies within the 
National Party. Dipico is believed to favour Kimberley as the 
capital. 
  Latest election results show the African National Congress 
is 
likely to win 15 seats, the NP [National Party] 12, Freedom 
Front two and Democratic Party one, observers said. 
  Born the eldest of four children in Kimberley's Greenpoint 
township on 21 April 1959, Dipico was raised by his domestic 
servant mother and matriculated from the prestigious St Boniface 
School in 1979. An early job on a diamond mine ended when he 
was fired after a wage strike, and Dipico enrolled for a BA at 
Fort Hare University where he became involved in the Azanian 
Students Organisation [Azazo] and underground ANC structures. 
By 1984 he was local Azazo treasurer and the organisation's 
delegate to the border region United Democratic Front. 
  His detention that year for involvement in anti-Ciskei 
activities saw him refused readmission to Fort Hare. He 
returned to Kimberly to become full-time regional organiser of 
the National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] and an integral figure 
in the Northern Cape United Democratic Front. The 1986 state of 
emergency saw him detained for five months, and in August 1987 
he was jailed for five years for furthering the aims of the ANC. 
Released from jail in June 1990, Dipico returned to the NUM 
head office, later becoming head of the union's education 
department, a post he still holds today. In May 1991 he was 
elected secretary general of the Northern Cape ANC, becoming 
chairman in June the next year. 
  A keen football administrator, Dipico enjoys table tennis 
and 
jogging. He plans to marry soon

  [Text] East London May 5 SAPA -- Raymond Mhlaba spent 25 
years of his life in prison cells. This week he may have a 
presidential palace at his disposal -- the official residence of 
former Ciskei ruler Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. 
  Sentenced to life for sabotage, the grey-haired Mhlaba is 
now 
the ANC's premier-designate for the Eastern Cape. 
  He was born in Mazoka Village in the Fort Beaufort District 
in 1920, and initially worked in a laundry in Port Elizabeth 
after leaving school. 
  An active trade unionist during the 1940s, he was one of the 
ANC leaders arrested during the transport boycott of 1952. 
  After the ANC was banned he joined other exiles doing 
military training. 
  Returning to South Africa in 1962, he commanded Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] until 1963, when 
he was arrested along with Nelson Mandela and others at a farm 
in Rivonia. 
  He served time on Robben Island, but was transferred to 
Pollsmoor in 1982, where by special permission he married his 
common-law wife and mother of his three children, Dedika Heliso, 
in 1986. 
  Nelson Mandela was a witness at the ceremony, conducted in 
the prison commandant's office. 
  Afterwards Mhlaba was legally permitted to touch his wife 
for 
the first time in 22 years. 
  After his release in October 1989, he was elected to the ANC 
National Executive and SA [South African] Communist Party 
Central Committee. 
  In January 1994 he was chosen as the ANC's premier-designate 
for a unified Eastern Cape. 
  The region includes Transkei, Ciskei, the Border and the 
Eastern Province, and is plagued by massive unemployment and a 
legacy of underdevelopment. 
  Top priorities, according to Mhlaba, are job creation, 
education and housing, and basic needs like water and 
electricity. 
  Mhlaba, who has played an active role in the Eastern Cape 
development forum, believes one way of dealing with these 
problems is for agriculture and manufacturing in the region to 
develop export markets. He has also emphasised the importance 
of restoring law and order. 
  Ironically Mhlaba may take over the unified region only to 
see it split in two -- a proposal being widely discussed. 
Bisho, capital of the former Ciskeian state, is the Eastern 
Cape regional capital. There has been speculation that Mhlaba 
will move into Brigadier Gqozo's luxury residence. 
  However a spokesman for the premier-designate's office in 
King William's Town said he did not believe Mhlaba had taken a 
decision on the matter. This would depend on discussions with 
the provincial secretary and coordinator, who were making 
logistic arrangements.

  [Text] Bloemfontein May 5 SAPA -- A linguist and rugby fan, 
the Orange Free State's new premier Patrick "Terror" Lekota this 
week launched his regional leadership with an emphasis on 
economic development and racial reconciliation. 
  A veteran African National Congress leader who served 13 
years in prison, Lekota, 45, is believed to enjoy fairly wide 
acceptance among whites in the Free State, a region the ANC won 
with an electoral landslide. "He is an accepted Freestater. I 
think whites trust and respect him," said University of the 
Orange Free State [UOFS] political science head, Prof Daan 
Wessels. 
  Lekota tells of his hurt over the lack of understanding 
between black and white, and of a deep desire for racial harmony 
in the Free State, which he says is the region best suited for 
reconciliation. 
  He speaks English, Afrikaans, Zulu, Sesotho, Tswana and 
Xhosa, and wants everyone to learn each other's language to 
foster mutual understanding and cross cultural bridges. 
  Fluent in Afrikaans, he sees "die taal" [Afrikaans] as an 
important part of SA [South African] history which should not be 
lost. 
  And he wants the provincial rugby side to win the Curry Cup 
at least every five years, hoping his plans to develop the Free 
State economy will keep its best players from leaving for 
greener pastures. "He is a level headed guy who will be able to 
attend to all the different communities in this region," said 
Hennie Strydom, professor of international law at UOFS. 
  A white policeman saluted Lekota this week when he visited 
the new provincial legislature in the historic fourth raadsaal, 
and the Free State's first black leader was first to complain 
about the removal of the busts of SA's former white rulers. 
  He is said to be embarrassed about the nickname "Terror", 
which comes not from a violent past but a schoolteacher who 
admired the way he terrorised the defence on the soccer field. 
  There is no bitterness or embarrassment about time spent in 
prison, almost a third of his life, which he describes as a 
duty. "I am in prison for the sake of peace for our country," he 
once wrote in a letter to his daughter. 
  Born on 13 August 1948 on a farm near Senekal, the eldest of 
seven children, the young Lekota was raised by his grandfather 
before moving to Kroonstad aged 11 to join his migrant worker 
parents. 
  He was sent by his father to a Catholic high school in 
Matatiele, Transkei, later matriculating at St Francis College 
in Durban where he came into contact with influential 
anti-apartheid activists like the late Black Consciousness 
leader Steve Biko. 
  He worked as a teacher and court interpreter after school to 
raise money for further studies, and with help from the Catholic 
Church enrolled in 1971 to study social work at the University 
of the North, where he was elected to the students 
representative council. 
  In 1972 Lekota was barred from further study following a 
class boycott over the expulsion of an SA Students' Organisation 
(SASO) leader, and he returned to Durban to become national 
organiser of SASO. 
  Charged under the Terrorism Act in September 1974 for 
organising pro-Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] rallies to 
celebrate Mozambican independence, he was sentenced to six years 
on Robben Island, his first of several spells in prison and 
detention. 
  Like many Black Consciousness adherents, Lekota's 
experiences 
with ANC leaders on the island saw him shift towards 
non-racialism. 
  He was released at the end of 1982 and the next year elected 
national publicity secretary for the United Democratic Front 
[UDF]. 
  Lekota was detained in 1984 before the tricameral 
parliamentary elections, which the UDF opposed, and in 1985 
charged with high treason for his alleged role in civil 
disturbances and rent boycotts in the Vaal Triangle. 
  The ensuing 42-month Delmas treason trial landed him back on 
Robben Island in December 1988, but he returned triumphant a 
year later after his 12-year sentence was overturned on appeal. 
  The unbanning of the ANC in 1990 saw Lekota appointed its 
convenor for southern Natal and later that year as northern Free 
State organiser. 
  He was elected to the ANC's National Executive Committee in 
July 1991 and subsequently to its National Working Committee 
where he headed the Intelligence Department, and the ANC's 
elections commission from mid-1992. 
  Lekota married a Zulu woman, Cynthia Shange, while in 
Pretoria Central Prison in 1975, and has four children ranging 
from three to 19 years old.

  [Text] Johannesburg, May 5 SAPA -- Tokyo Sexwale gained 
real political prominence ironically with the death of his 
friend and colleague Chris Hani after the assassination of the 
South African Communist Party's secretary general on April 10, 
1993. 
  Pictures of Mr Sexwale weeping over the lifeless body of 
Hani 
flashed across the world and in many ways the days to follow 
would gain him much support of the militant youth mourning their 
leader Chris Hani. 
  Himself a former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the 
Nation; ANC military wing] cadre Sexwale joined the African 
National Congress underground structure in the 1970's and in 
1975 he went into exile to undergo military training in the 
Soviet Union, specialising in army engineering. 
  He returned to South Africa in the late seventies and was 
arrested after a run-in with the South African security forces. 
  Together with 11 other activists he was charged with 
terrorism and conspiracy to overthrow the government -- and he 
was convicted and sentenced to 18 [years] imprisonment at Robben 
Island maximum prison in 1978. 
  He served 13 years of his term before he was released in 
1990 
in terms of the Groote Schuur agreement between the government 
and the ANC. 
  Four months after his release he was elected to the 
Executive 
Committee of the ANC's PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region. 
  In October 1991 he was elected as chairperson of the region 
-- a post to which he was re-elected three times. 
  In 1994 he was elected unopposed and also stood as the ANC's 
candidate for the PWV premiership in the April election. 
  Mr Sexwale was born on March 5, 1953 in Johannesburg where 
he 
lived and attended school in Soweto until his matriculation at 
Orlando West High School. 
  He was also a member of the Black Consciousness Movement in 
the late 1960's and seventies. 
  Mr Sexwale enjoys reading and listening to music and when 
time permits watching soccer and playing tennis. He is also a 
keen chess player -- although he claims he always loses. 
  He is married to Judy whom he met while on Robben Island. 
They have three children.

  [Text] Nelspruit, May 5, SAPA -- When Mathews Phosa fled to 
Mozambique in April 1985, he left behind an unusual range of 
professional and business activities. 
  As a high profile lawyer, political campaigner, member of an 
underground ANC cell and working for MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- 
Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing], MK counter-intelligence 
had informed him that the South African security forces were 
plotting to kill him. 
  Now Nakedi Mathews Phosa is to be sworn in as premier of the 
Eastern Transvaal region following the massive ANC victory in 
this region during the general elections. 
  He is currently the chairperson of the ANC in the Eastern 
Transvaal. 
  Mathews Phosa was born in Mbombela township at Nelspruit on 
September 1, 1952. His early years were spent on the farm in 
Potgietersrus with his grandfather. When he lost his land 
during the land removals young Phosa went to live with his 
parents in Nelspruit where his father was a teacher. 
  His mother, who was politically active, had a strong 
influence on his life telling him about Nelson Mandela in prison 
on Robben Island among other things. 
  He attended boarding school in Acornhoek. 
  Having matriculated with a distinction in agricultural 
science, Phosa studied law at the University of the North. 
Steve Biko and Themba Sono were the heroes of his generation. 
  At university Phosa started publishing poetry in English and 
Afrikaans. 
  He graduated, completed his articles and started a legal 
firm 
of which he is still the senior partner. 
  Besides serving as national organiser of the Black Lawyers' 
Association, Phosa was on the board of directors of a business 
and of a welfare organisation he had founded. 
  When the then apartheid government wanted to incorporate 
KaNgwane into Swaziland, he was prominent in the campaigns 
against the move. He also led the rent boycotts in the Eastern 
Transvaal. During this time - in the early 1980's he joined MK 
and the ANC underground. 
  During his stay in Mozambique he became part of a machinery 
directing political and military activity in the Eastern 
Transvaal. In 1990 he was among the first cadres sent home to 
begin negotiations with the government. 
  As a lawyer he is currently involved in defending members of 
the movement and organising the ANC Legal Department. 
  He is a member of the National Negotiations Commission and 
serves on the police board in terms of the Peace Accord. 
  He is married to social worker Yvonne Nkwenkwezi and has 
three children. 
  The Eastern Transvaal region incorporates KaNgwane and 
KwaNdebele. It is a rich coal mining and industrial area, where 
sheep and fruit farming as well as forestry are among the main 
income generators. The Eastern Transvaal is also a well-known 
South African tourism destination.

  [Text] Pietersburg, May 5, SAPA -- He struggled for 
recognition as a poet, but instead students hailed him as a 
political figure. Now he is to become the premier of the 
Northern Transvaal region after the ANC victory in the general 
elections. 
  One of six children, Ngoako Abel Ramathlodi was born in 
Tauetswala near Potgietersrus on August 21, 1955. 
  Ramathlodi matriculated at the Tembisa High School and chose 
law as a career. 
  His tertiary educational years were troubled. 
  He enrolled for a BJuris degree at the University of the 
North in 1976, and after two expulsions finally completed a 
masters degree in law in Zimbabwe in 1988. 
  His introduction to politics came through the Marimba Arts - 
a poetry and drama society. While Ramathlodi was writing poetry 
about his life the rest of the group was writing political 
poetry. The move from art and poetry to politics proved to be a 
shorter step than expected. Students worshipped him for his 
poetry and without realising it he became a political figure and 
not just a poet. 
  In 1977 he was expelled from the University of the North for 
political reasons, but allowed back in 1978. 
  During this time he joined the ANC during a trip to 
Botswana. 
  In 1979 he was again expelled for political upheaval and 
took 
the university to court for unlawful expulsion. He won the 
case, but failed his examinations. In 1980 he was refused 
admission to the university. 
  He went into exile in Lesotho on July 17, 1980 where he 
enrolled for a BA law degree at the University of Lesotho. He 
graduated in 1984. 
  In this time he was prominent within the ANC and on campus 
in 
the Committee for Action and Solidarity for South African 
Students. 
  He enrolled for a LLB degree at the University in 1985, but 
his two-year course was cut short with the 1986 coup which 
deposed President Leabua Jonathan. 
  Ramathlodi was then sent to Zimbabwe via Zambia where he 
joined the University in Harare in 1986 and wrote his final 
exam. By 1988 he had a masters degree in law. 
  During his studies he served the ANC as head of the regional 
political military council. On his return to Zambia he worked 
as a speech writer for Oliver Tambo. 
  He married Ouma Mathuding in 1983. They have a son, 
Setlhodiane. 
  He is currently deputy registrar and executive assistant to 
the principal at the University of the North near Pietersburg. 
He also teaches public international law. 
  The Northern Transvaal region, where he is to be inaugurated 
as premier, is one the largest and poorest regions in the 
country with extensive socio-economic problems. Mostly rural 
the region includes Lebowa, Venda and Gazankulu. Pietersburg is 
the largest urban centre in the region.

  [Text] Mmabatho May 5 SAPA -- Azanian Peoples' Organisation 
[Azapo] founder member, North West premier-elect Popo Molefe, 
left the organisation after he reconciled himself with there 
being a role for whites in anti-apartheid groupings. 
  The 42-year old former United Democratic Front general 
secretary, is a current African National Congress National 
Executive Committee member. 
  Born in Sophiatown (now Triomf) in Johannesburg in 1952, Mr 
Molefe was one of eight children. His mother was a domestic 
worker and his father a labourer. 
  Vivid memories of being taunted by white children in his 
earlier life convinced him of the need for change in South 
Africa. 
  He joined the Black Peoples' Convention while still in 
school 
in 1974 and a year later linked up with the South African 
Students' Union. 
  He first ran into trouble with the police in August 1976 
when 
he was detained for seven months. 
  Mr Molefe was a founder member of Azapo and served as Soweto 
branch chairman between 1979 and 1980. 
  But he resigned a year later and assisted in formation of 
the 
UDF [United Democratic Front] in 1983 as well as sitting on the 
Soweto Civic Organistion's executive form 1982-1984. 
  He was arrested several times in the early 1980s and in 1985 
he was accused along with 22 others in the lengthy Delmas 
treason trial. 
  Mr Molefe received a 10-year sentence after the 
three-and-a-half year trial, but the sentence was overturned by 
the Supreme Court in 1989. 
  In 1990 he was elected ANC Alexandra branch chairman and ANC 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] deputy chairman later 
in the year. 
  He was appointed ANC national elections commission chairman 
in 1992. 
  Mr Molefe will presided over an area made up largely of the 
former pieces of Bophuthatswana with its casinos and platinum 
mines, the goldfields of Western Transvaal and the arid 
north-eastern Cape. 
  Married to Boitumelo Elizabeth Plaatjie, he has four 
children.

  [Text] Ulundi May 5 SAPA -- Dr. Frank Themba Mdlalose, 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] premier designate for KwaZulu-Natal 
has had a long and illustrious political career spanning about 
19 years. 
  Educated at St Francis High School, Mariannhill, outside 
Durban, the good-natured Mdlalose matriculated in 1949. He then 
attended the University of Fort Hare where he obtained an 
education diploma. 
  From 1950 until 1953 he was the African National Congress 
Youth League branch president. 
  Mdlalose continued his studies at the University of Natal 
and 
in 1958 he obtained his MB CH B degree, and became a resident 
doctor at Durban's King Edward Hospital. 
  Subsequently he became a medical practitioner in 
Atteridgeville near Pretoria, and Steadville and Madadeni in 
northern Natal. 
  Mdlalose joined the IFP at its launch in 1975. 
  In 1978 Mdlalose was appointed minister of interior in the 
KwaZulu Legislative Assembly [KLA] in Ulundi -- a position he 
held for five years. He was then appointed minister of health. 
  Mdlalose has won the respect and admiration of political 
friend and foe alike as an outspoken and gentle-mannered 
politician. 
  He has often taken a more moderate line than his KLA 
counterparts. Mdlalose has played a vital role in steering the 
IFP through the hurly-burly of democracy negotiations. He was 
appointed minister without portfolio to take on this mantle as a 
negotiator at the World Trade Centre. 
  Rumours abounded in 1993 that he had attempted to resign but 
was persuaded otherwise by close friend and IFP leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. A subsequent car crash in which Mdlalose 
sustained serious injuries is still shrouded in mystery. 
  Mdlalose was born in Nquthu, northern Natal to Jaconia 
Mdlalose, a general dealer and Tabitha Mthembu, a teacher. 
  He is married to Eunice Nokuthula Sikhosane and has three 
sons and two daughters. His interests include child welfare, 
tennis and boxing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Derek Hanekom, coordinator of the ANC's Land </F>
and Regional Affairs Department, by correspondent Ferial 
Hafferjee, on the "PM News Wrap" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] The African National Congress plans to introduce 
land reform legislation within the first 100 days of the sitting 
of the new parliament. Ferial Hafferjee reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Hafferjee] One of the biggest nettles an 
ANC-led government will have to grasp, is land reform. Today 
the ANC held a first post-election policy conference where it 
recounted its land plans. Among these are ways to deal with 
land restitution for those who lost their land through apartheid 
policies, and with land redistribution necessary to correct the 
imbalance, which still has over 80 percent of the land in the 
hands of 13 percent of the population. Land restitution alone 
is likely to see a million claims come before a land claims 
court. Land redistribution is likely to be an even bigger 
undertaking. What will it all cost? Well, the ANC didn't have 
the figures with them today but they did say that there would be 
two budgets, one for land restitution, which will last for three 
years, and a separate budget for land reform and redistribution. 
Derek Hanekom is the ANC's coordinator of land and agricultural 
policy. Mr. Hanekom, the policies you've outlined today are not 
new, but does the ANC say them with a new confidence, with your 
hands on the reins of government and on the purse strings of 
government? 
  [Hanekom] Well, of course we have a lot more confidence, not 
that we ever really doubted that we would win these elections, 
but it's a good feeling to know that the majority of people in 
South Africa have come out in overwhelming support for us on the 
basis of our policies, not on the basis of rhetoric, or symbols, 
or anything like that. We want to address them in such a way 
that they do not have a negative effect on the country's 
economy, that people...[pauses] that they don't lead to social 
instability or threaten people's property interests, etcetera. 
It is very important for us to show to our electorate that we 
are serious about our promises. 
  [Hafferjee] Could you just tell me in a nutshell how you are 
going to deal with the two R's -- restitution and redistribution? 
  [Hanekom] The two major aspects of a land reform program in 
South Africa, will, as you said, lie in a restitution program, 
that means returning the land to those people who were forcibly 
removed from their land, and other measures of redistribution. 
On the restitution side we have announced today that we intend 
setting up a land claims court and we also said today that it is 
a concept which enjoys very wide support, that dealing with this 
very sensitive issue through a court, is the only fair way of 
dealing with it. We believe that there should be accompanying 
land redistribution processes, which means that those people who 
are excluded from the court process must also be able to gain 
access to land. We are saying one of the measures which we 
could introduce is to ensure that they are able to get...gain 
access to finance for land purchase. 
  People who are prepared to buy land, but do not have the 
means to do so, who cannot reasonably be expected to pay full 
market value of their land because it will take them some time 
before they can establish themselves properly on that land -- we 
believe that they should be the beneficiaries of a state 
assisted program. None of this, none of our land reform program 
is based on expropriation or based on confiscation. [end

  [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- The African National 
Congress will propose that the first session of the new 
Parliament deal with a bill for an act to redress the claims of 
people who lost land through apartheid laws. Unveiling its 
agricultural policy at a Johannesburg press briefing on 
Wednesday [4 May], the ANC said the legislation should be 
considered in the first sitting of Parliament because of the 
urgency and emotions attached to land claims. 
  The proposed land rights restitution act is intended to deal 
with claims arising from the dispossession of landowners caused 
by, among other things, forced removals. 
  The proposed act will require claims to be lodged within 
three years of the establishment of a Government of National 
Unity. 
  The ANC proposes claims be lodged with a land claims 
commission, which will investigate them and try to negotiate and 
mediate settlements. Settlements agreed to will be subject to 
scrutiny by the commission to determine their fairness. 
  A land claims court will be asked to ratify any settlements 
reached and also to judge disputed or complex cases. 
  Some landowners in the Eastern Transvaal were already 
negotiating settlements with dispossessed communities and 
labourer tenants, the ANC said. 
  It said the proposed act would promote the reasonable and 
constructive settlement of claims by all the parties involved, 
in the hope of discouraging landowners from thwarting claims by 
evicting claimants and selling the land. 
  In the event of pre-emptive action by landowners the dispute 
would be referred to the land claims court, it said. 
  As for people who had claims based on their exclusion from 
land rights, they would be subject to a policy of land 
redistribution backed by a financing mechanism.

  [Text] Far-reaching changes for land reforms and the 
lifting of tax on basic foodstuff are proposed in the ANC's 
agricultural policy document released today. The ANC says that 
a law on the restoration of land will be tabled in parliament as 
soon as possible. A land claims court will soon begin with its 
hearing on land claims. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andre Scheepers] This court 
will be managed on the same basis as a supreme court. Claims 
being considered include cases where people were forced from 
their land or where they lost land according to the old 
apartheid laws. Utilization of unused state land will also be 
looked at. The court is only seen as an interim measure, and 
approximately 1 million people will be involved in this. Claims 
that will not be considered are any claims before 19 June 1913 
and where land was legally confiscated. Claims not made within 
a certain period, to be stipulated by the president, will also 
not be considered. The issue of compensation could be a hotly 
disputed one. 
  [ANC spokesperson Aninka Claassens, in English] In 
situations 
where people bought the land from which people...[pauses] black 
people had been removed, they often bought it at subsidized 
rates in terms of the Agricultural Credits Act, so they paid 
less than market value. Now what the constitution provides is 
that compensation will be determined according to various 
criteria, including market value, including the history of the 
acquisition and including the use to which the land is being 
put, so in a situation where farmers may have got land from 
which black people were removed, at less than market value, they 
won't get market value because if they did what you'd have is a 
situation where they profit twice from what happened under 
apartheid. 
  [Scheepers] This agricultural policy is chiefly aimed at 
uplifting the approximately 16 million people in rural areas. 
The ANC says direct intervention in markets will improve and 
stabilize the buying power of South Africans. Among the aims: 
To take steps to make food affordable, the lifting of VAT 
[Value-Added Tax] on basic foods, increased VAT on luxury goods, 
investment in labor-intensive agricultural sectors, as well as 
in infrastructural projects such as the building of roads and 
irrigation schemes. Credit will be given to black farmers to 
enable them to obtain land. In this regard the Land Bank and 
other agricultural institutions will be considered. Although 
the ANC is in favor of deregulation the state will intervene in 
certain cases. Support services, research, and consumer 
protection services will be supplied. Environmental protection 
is also high on the list. There is also additional food 
subsidies, and in this regard the ANC aims at removing the 
remaining statutory powers of the agricultural councils. Land 
tax is also an issue to be considered. 
  [ANC spokesman Derek Hanekom, in English] We do believe it 
could be a very useful policy instrument to stimulate the land 
market. It is used successfully in some countries in the world. 
We have discussed this with the South African Agricultural 
Union and provided them with several good arguments as to the 
desirability of a land tax. We would say that it has the good 
effect of bringing land into production. Those people who are 
unable to use their land properly, or fully, would be encouraged 
to either use it more fully or to sell off or lease off the 
parts of their land which they are presently not using. So we 
believe that it would have the dual effect of getting land onto 
the market as part of the land reform program, as well as 
stimulating greater productive use of land. [end recording]

  [Text] The president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, 
Mr., Dries Bruwer, says a new government should have talks with 
organized agriculture before completing an agricultural and land 
policy for South Africa. Mr. Bruwer was reacting to the ANC's 
land policy announcement yesterday in which sweeping land 
reforms were envisaged. Mr. Bruwer said land claims and demands 
had always been a sensitive matter and should be approached with 
great circumspection because of their conflict potential. He 
said a government which did not take cultural differences into 
account could destabilize a country. Referring to land demands 
after forced settlement, Mr. Bruwer said the ANC should not 
forget that large numbers of white farmers had also been 
resettled. He said traditional land ownership applied to white 
farmers in the same way as it did to the other five ethnic 
groups in the Northern Transvaal.

  [Text] Pretoria May 4 SAPA -- Two hundred Umkhonto we Sizwe 
[Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing -- MK] instructors are 
undergoing "induction training" at the South African Air Force 
Gymnasium in Pretoria in preparation for the integration of MK 
with the National Defence Force. 
  The South African National Defence Force's [SANDF] internal 
communication bulletin this week said the two-week course, to 
end on May 13, would enable the African National Congress 
military wing members to give induction training to their 
colleagues in assembly-point areas, "thus contributing to a 
smoother process of integration". 
  The group is being trained in military terminology, military 
law, personal financial planning and military etiquette, 
including mess etiquette. 
  The bulletin said the course would overcome any shortcomings 
in military skills among the trainees, adding that their basic 
training might have been different to that approved by the Joint 
Military Co-ordinating Council of the SANDF. "This will ensure 
that they suffer no relative disadvantage in relation to the 
members of the other forces involved in the integration 
process," it said. "This is a pure orientation course, therefore 
no formal evaluation will be done." 
  The bulletin said the trainees would be under the command of 
the officer commanding the gymnasium and a high standard of 
discipline would be expected. The bulletin also said other MK 
members were being trained in ceremonial drill to prepare them 
to form part of the guard of honour at the inauguration of the 
new president on May 10.

  [Text] The Transitional Executive Council's subcouncil on 
defense will today decide on the future of the National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF]. A NPKF spokesman, Colonel Coenie van 
Rensburg, said a new intake by the peace force will also not be 
trained at De Brug. He said the various forces comprising the 
peace force no longer have soldiers available. Col. van 
Rensburg said members of the peace force, after several 
incidents since their deployment on the East Rand, have not been 
limited to their bases but are instead performing supporting 
roles in conjunction with the Defense Force.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Possible Viljoen Ministerial Portfolio Viewed -- "Constand 
Viljoen, Minister of Defence?" asks the Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "On one level that is 
an outlandish notion, requiring both an other-worldly degree of 
ANC magnanimity and a somersault from the Freedom Front. Almost 
impossible. But now that South Africa is in the business of 
pulling off the impossible, here's one to consider closely." 
THE STAR urges that the ANC keep 2 points in mind: Viljoen's 
"3 percent looks microscopic on the bar charts, but translated 
into a proportion of the men in tank cockpits and airport 
control towers it assumes a new magnitude altogether." 
Secondly, the editorial questions whether "there are other 
hands better able to carry through 'effective' affirmative 
action". "Superficially a Viljoen appointment would fly in the 
face of both parties policies. Deeply examined it might serve 
both, and the nation," concludes the THE STAR. 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Need for Principled Finance Minister -- "The Finance 
Ministry 
will arguably be the most important department in the new 
government," declares the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English 
on 5 May in a page-12 editorial. "It is also likely to be the 
most unpopular, as the principal function of Nelson Mandela's 
first finance minister will be to say no. President Mandela 
will rule a country of expectations which cannot be realised, of 
promises which cannot all be met, certainly not in the short 
term." As disappointed as the business community may be if 
Derek Keys is not allowed to continue in his job, Keys may not 
be the "right person to turn down" the "flood of requests for 
money." "There is a strong argument to be made that keeping 
Cabinet colleagues to their spending limits will take more than 
Keys's determination and understanding of the economy; it will 
require someone with deep ANC roots and party authority to have 
those limitations accepted in the Cabinet and by an expectant 
populace." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  IEC Running of Election Viewed -- "Let us start by 
complimenting the Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] for 
accomplishing the impossible," begins the Johannesburg SOWETAN 
in English on 5 May in a page-8 editorial. "It is, however, 
with some regret that we have to record some shocking mistakes 
that could have sent us back to square one. The halt in the 
counting of the results is just not good enough." The editorial 
criticizes the postponement of the formal induction of Mandela, 
the sitting of the regional legislatures, and celebrations. 
"Having said all that we must be generous in our thanks that 
things have come to this point without too much distress and 
hardly any violence." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  Local Skills Must Be Used -- Johannesburg RAPPORT in 
Afrikaans on 1 May says in a page-14 editorial: "Events around 
the past week's general election identified two important 
guidelines for the future, which were indicated long before a 
start was made at counting the votes: how the country could be 
governed to prosperity in the future, and how it should not be 
done. The IEC, no doubt with the best intentions in the world, 
demonstrated how things should not be done. Despite the 
greatest plans and funding, which ran into the better part of a 
billion rands, members of the commission and their extended but 
untested staff proved that theory and practice are far from 
being the same thing." "The IEC, starry-eyed and mesmerized by 
affirmative action, decided to keep the Department of Home 
Affairs at arm's length, and did the same to the local printing 
industry, and even the security forces, all of which had to be 
eventually drawn into the printing and delivery of ballot 
papers." "This country is blessed with a wealth of people who 
are not only ready to help build a new dispensation, but are 
also of inestimable value for the development of future skills. 
After all, practical skills and their application are the real 
capital of the new era, never mind how much money is or is not 
available. The same applies to the government. There are many 
businessmen who managed to keep the wheels of state turning 
under difficult circumstances -- sanctions, boycotts, and a 
shrinking world economy." The country will need them, says 
RAPPORT, "because in the final analysis it is the people who 
will make this country succeed, with a little bit of give and 
take." 
  Need To Handle Far-Right With Sympathy -- In an article on 
page 14 of RAPPORT, Z.B. du Toit notes: "The word 
`reconciliation' is high on the list of the new government of 
national unity which was elected this week. But there is a 
significant group, generally referred to in the media as 
`far-right', who show little inclination towards that. A group 
of journalists experienced this at first hand on Thursday when 
they faced the hatred and venom of about 250 AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] supporters at a rally at 
Boekenhoutfontein," where the journalists became "the target of 
an eruption of bitterness by people who reject the new order 
with astonishing intensity. From statements it was clear that 
it was not only the coming to power of a new government that was 
unacceptable, but also that such an event was seen as a triumph 
of evil over good." "The AWB rally was only a small sample of 
the deep feeling of rejection and estrangement by the 
far-right." Du Toit continues: "Yet even at the root of the 
far-right's estrangement there must be a deep awareness that 
their leaders could not stem the new South Africa; that 
right-wing resistance politics has failed for the past two 
decades. For understandable reasons the blame is placed not on 
their own leaders who tried during this time to entrench a white 
minority government... No, the principles of the democratic wave 
with the vote for all is simply ignored." "If reconciliation 
between white and black is a real challenge in the new 
dispensation, it will be a much greater task to bind the 
far-right back into society. At this point such a possibility 
looks remote," but "a new government, in addition to all its 
other tasks, will have to try to understand the roots of the 
far-right estrangement and handle it with sympathy. In this, 
the Afrikaners in the new government and Parliament will have to 
actively assist. Otherwise the nice young boys and girls cutely 
dressed in khaki at the AWB rally will grow up quite normally as 
a new estranged generation. Estranged, and with a growing 
resentment, and therefore increasingly dangerous. That must be 
prevented, because it is totally unnecessary."

democratic South Africa, the right honorable prime minister, Dr. 
Ntsu Mokhehle, spoke about the importance of cementing bonds of 
good neighborliness and cooperation between Lesotho and South 
Africa as independent sovereign states. The prime minister said 
the issue of integration or incorporation of Lesotho into the 
new South Africa was therefore not necessary. On the issue of 
the boundary between Lesotho and the Orange Free State, Dr. 
Mokhehle said this was a national issue which must be followed 
up. He said it is a matter to be resolved by the people through 
a democratic parliament.

  [Text] According to a report UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali has submitted to the UN Security Council for its 
consideration, some 17,000 government and Mozambique National 
Resistance, Renamo, soldiers must be demobilized from the 
centers where they are serving at this stage. Such centers 
include hospital, air, and naval bases, as well as barracks. 
  The report presented to the UN Security Council says that 
soldiers have had to stay in their assembly areas for long 
periods because of demobilization delays. The UN secretary 
general's report also mentions delays in the scrapping of some 
155,000 militia and other (?paramilitary) forces, and it adds 
that a lack of air transportation helped paralyze that process 
in March, though half of the weapons declared by the government, 
in the hands of the paramilitary forces, had been collected in 
April.

  [Text] Speaking in Tete Province yesterday, President of 
the Republic Joaquim Chissano announced that the government has 
decided to temporarily suspend its troop demobilization process. 
As a reason for such a decision, the Mozambican head of state 
said that the Mozambique National Resistance's [Renamo] troop 
demobilization process had not been balanced. He also noted the 
need for making technical corrections to the figures and lists 
that Renamo has been supplying to the UN Operations in 
Mozambique Technical Unit. 
  NOTICIAS reports that President Joaquim Chissano made that 
announcement after visiting the troop assembly area in Ulongwe, 
the capital of Tete Province's Angonia District. NOTICIAS also 
reports that the Mozambican head of state warned the soldiers of 
the need for them to remain in the area for a while longer. He 
explained that it is an area that continues to deserve special 
attention. NOTICIAS says President Chissano was indirectly 
referring to the fact that Renamo soldiers continue to be 
powerfully armed and terrorizing the civilian population in many 
parts of Tete Province. 
  The president of the Republic traveled 260 km on the road 
between the city of Tete, the provincial capital, and Angonia 
District. He passed many areas where Renamo continues to 
prevent the Mozambican Government from implementing the National 
Reconstruction Program and other political organizations from 
doing their political work. 
  NOTICIAS also reports today that a South African citizen was 
distributing photographs of Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama in one 
of the areas visited by the Mozambican head on his way to 
Angonia District. That South African citizen had not been 
allowed to come into the country from Malawi, but was 
subsequently seen in Mozambican territory.

  [Text] The leader of the Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] movement in Mozambique, Mr. Afonso Dhlakama, has 
attacked the United Nations' operation mission in Mozambique for 
complaining about Renamo's slow demobilization. 
  Speaking at Maputo Airport yesterday on his return from a 
two 
week trip to Europe and Kenya, he said the UN's complaints that 
Renamo is demobilizing its troops too slowly are meaningless. 
The head of the UN operation has threatened to take issue 
before the UN Security Council. 
  Mr. Dhlakama also said the was skeptical about a recent UN 
announcement that various foreign countries have already pledged 
13 million dollars to assist Renamo in its preparations for 
October's multiparty elections. He said the UN always talks of 
millions of dollars for Renamo, but they never see the money. 
  He welcomed the ANC's victory in South Africa's elections 
despite a history of poor relations between the two 
organizations. He has been invited to the ceremony to 
inaugurate Mr. Nelson Mandela as president.

  [Text] Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana told Radio 
Mozambique in Maputo today that there is nothing dramatic 
threatening the Mozambican peace process. Minister Hunguana was 
reacting to speculation concerning the Mozambican Government's 
successive requests to postpone the Supervision and Control 
Commission [CSC] meeting to analyze a report by UN Special 
Representative Aldo Ajello. 
  Minister Hunguana described the report as extensive, adding 
it presents many problems that require action, rather than a 
formal response. He noted that the government has been working 
to present the CSC with concrete details concerning the schedule 
to be followed up to the holding of elections in October. 
  Meanwhile, Radio Mozambique has learned that the CSC is 
scheduled to meet in Maputo tomorrow.

  [Excerpts] The Supervision and Control Commission, CSC, has 
received 12 notifications of alleged cease-fire violations. 
Eight of those came from the government and the other four from 
the Mozambique National Resistance, Renamo. A total of (?10) of 
those reports have already been investigated. Only two must 
still be investigated. 
  In his report to the UN Security Council, UN Secretary 
General said that neither the government nor Renamo have allowed 
the UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, access to certain 
military bases. His report also noted that neither side has 
supplied full military equipment lists yet. Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
also noted in his report that some government assembly areas are 
too full while others are virtually empty. [passage omitted] 
  In his report, the UN secretary general also said that by 18 
April Renamo had demobilized 3 percent of all its listed forces 
in the assembly areas, while the government had released 28 
percent of its men.

  [Text] The first special forces battalion of the new 
Mozambican army received its stripes at the training center 
situated in the Nacala Air Force Base in Nampula Province. The 
harsh and weary course lasted for 10 weeks. The battalion 
consists of 31 officers, 62 noncommissioned officers, and 252 
troops. A total of 116 men was excluded from the course. 
  The UN Operations in Mozambique says it is looking for an 
area where the battalion will be stationed. The battalion is 
supposed to be the embryo of the Mozambique Defense Armed 
Forces' [FADM] Special Forces. The commander of the Portuguese 
training team noted that the battalion requires special weapons 
and modern equipment, as well as a sound logistics system. He 
said it is important that the battalion is correctly used, and 
its responsibilities clearly defined. He added: Mozambique's 
armed forces requirements should consider quality first instead 
of quantity. 
  Generals Tobias Dai for the government and Herminio Morais 
for the Mozambique National Resistance attended the ceremony. 
Aldo Ajello and the Portuguese ambassador to Mozambique were 
also present. Dai said the training of FADM is an irreversible 
process, noting that the establishment of nonpartisan, career, 
and competent armed forces is a fact. He pledged greater 
government assistance to the new battalion, while Herminio de 
Morais asked the Mozambique Government to provide suitable 
logistical conditions for the new army. 
  In addition to the special forces battalion, the course also 
trained Mozambican instructors who will train new recruits in 
future courses. They will be assisted by Portuguese instructors.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] The Zimbabwe Government has finally capitulated in 
the so-called land grab scandal. There has been uproar in the 
country since it was found that land compulsorily acquired from 
white farmers for distribution to landless peasants was being 
assigned on license to government ministers and ruling party 
faithfuls. President Mugabe himself said that an investigation 
into the issue would be held. Now the agriculture minister, 
Kumbirai Kangai, has canceled the deals and taken some of the 
blame, as Fariah Mungazi reports from Harare: 
  The cancellation of the land agreement follows criticism of 
the Tenant Resettlement Scheme, under which farms earmarked for 
resettlement were leased to individuals, some of them top 
government officials. Lands, Agriculture and Water Development 
Minister Kumbirai Kangai told parliament in a ministerial 
statement that he shouldered responsibility for what he called 
the apparent misunderstanding that arose over the scheme. He 
said in our pursuance of that objective and in our enthusiasm 
to carry out the task we may have attracted criticism. However, 
he denied that the exercise was a scandal, saying the scheme was 
an appropriate tool for indigenization of the economy. He said, 
in line with government policy of indeginizing the economy, the 
ministry found it prudent to use the scheme to promote the 
advancement of emergent black commercial farmers. He described 
the scheme as a stop gap measure taken by his ministry in a bid 
to use the land productively, conserve natural resources, and 
prevent what he called vandalism of permanent improvements and 
assets on farms. The minister said some of the farms whose 
leases had been canceled were being handed over to the Ministry 
of Local Government for immediate resettlement. Those farms, 
whose resettlement plans were not yet in place, would be 
advertised for temporary leasing to members of the public.

  [Text] Thousands of Nigerians and members of the diplomatic 
corps defied a heavy downpour to witness the launching in Abuja 
today of the War Against Indiscipline and Corruption, WAIC, by 
the head of state, General Sani Abacha. The launching, which 
took place at the parade ground, was described by Gen. Abacha as 
a further proof of the determination of his administration to 
sanitize the Nigerian society. State House correspondent Chris 
Mbu has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Mbu] Launching the war, Gen. Abacha said 
it has become very clear that a profound social and moral reform 
program that will sanitize society is essential. He said that 
not only should indiscipline and corruption be routed out; 
Nigerians must seek to inculcate such basic values as honesty, 
trustworthiness, and respect for elders. The head of state said 
if human beings who constitute the active agents in the 
development process are not transformed, the very process of 
development can be frustrated or made considerably difficult. 
The war against indiscipline is not new in Nigeria but the 
fresh onslaught launched today under the present administration 
has defined objectives some of which are here given by the head 
of state. 
  [Abacha] To mobilize the nation to fight against corruption 
and economic crimes; 
  To create a special and more humane society through the 
inculcation of such basic values as honesty, integrity, 
patriotism, respect for the sanctity of human life, and respect 
for the rule of law; 
  To develop appropriate work ethics that will produce 
efficiency, effectiveness, high productivity, and (?real) 
commitment [words indistinct] within the context of a just and 
fair (?work system) anchored on the principle of dignity of 
labor; 
  To instill in the business and (?industry) at large the 
values of honesty, trustworthiness, efficiency, patriotism, 
fairness, and social compassion. 
  [Mbu] The other objectives include inculcating the values of 
patriotism, nationalism, integrity, quality work ethics, respect 
for constituted authority, and the promotion of a just, fair, 
and peaceful society that places immense value on the dignity 
and sanctity of human life. Gen. Abacha reminded Nigerians that 
indiscipline and corruption exist not only in the conduct of 
public affairs but also in the area of private affairs. He said 
the pervasiveness of corruption and indiscipline undermine the 
principle of equity and just reward for honest contributions of 
citizens to national well-being. He appealed to Nigerians to 
join hands with government in this fresh onslaught against 
indiscipline and corruption. The head of state symbolically 
launched the campaign by letting off some balloons. [end

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Edem Kodjo's Togolese Union for 
Democracy, UTD, today stated in a communique that the prime 
minister had "in no way" decided to resign in spite of the 
crisis that has broken out within the opposition, which has a 
majority in parliament. Last night, Mr. Kodjo had, in an 
interview with the AFP, envisaged this possibility if allies 
persisted in their refusal to participate in the government.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by President Gnassingbe Eyadema and Prime </F>
Minister Edem Kodjo in Lome; date not given] 
  [Text] On 3 May at about 2130, some unknown persons 
launched a grenade attack on Le Relaxe Restaurant near the Be 
District water tower, which is run by a French national. The 
grenade was thrown across the fence of the candle-lit restaurant 
-- power supply to the area was cut at noon. On the spot 
evidence has shown that the grenade was Soviet-made. Six 
persons were wounded in the attack which caused some material 
damages. The wounded, who were admitted in a private clinic, 
include four Frenchmen, one German, and one Beninese trader. 
  As soon as they were informed, President Gnassingbe Eyadema 
and Prime Minister Edem Kodjo gave the necessary instructions to 
ensure the best medical attention for the wounded to avoid any 
deaths. Presently, two of the six wounded, including the 
restaurant owner, have already been discharged. Among the 
remaining wounded at the clinic, only one was seriously injured 
but he is out of danger. 
  The president of the Republic and the prime minister 
strongly 
condemn this cowardly attack which caused injuries to innocent 
victims. The investigations they have ordered are continuing 
and the perpetrators of this criminal act will, as soon as they 
are found, be tried by court and punished according to 
prevailing laws.

  [Excerpts] In Burundi Leonard Nyangoma, the minister of the 
interior and security, has been fired [declare demissionaire]. 
[passage omitted] 
  After the prime minister announced the dismissal of Mr. 
Nyangoma, the Front for Democracy in Burundi [Frodebu] recalled 
that its view is that, by virtue of the constitution, the head 
of government is no longer in office. Frodebu is therefore 
saying that the decisions of the prime minister are null and 
void.

  [Text] The general strike urged by the Federation of 
Chadian Trade Unions and followed by Chadian civil servants 
since 26 April in order to compel the government to sign a 
social pact is still being observed. It spread yesterday to the 
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation where employees have 
stopped work. Journalists and technical personnel in the public 
media are also on strike so radio and television are carrying 
only minimal programming. The government has consequently asked 
soldiers to operate these technical installations.

  [Text] A meeting has been taking place since this morning 
at the Gabonese Trade Union Confederation headquarters between 
Mines and Fuel Minister Paul Toungui and representatives of the 
various petroleum companies. The meeting follows the extension 
of the 48-hour warning strike launched by the workers of the 
Libreville Petroleum Group. This strike first resulted in a gas 
shortage and now a fuel shortage which has caused a lot of 
inconvenience for housewives and many drivers who could not get 
to work this morning. The petroleum workers, who are threatening 
to extend their strike to 8 May, are demanding a 15-percent 
salary increase. 
  [Paris AFP in French at 1158 GMT on 4 May in a similar 
Libreville-datelined report adds: "A two-day strike by workers 
of petroleum products distribution companies has today led to 
the suspension of domestic flights and a fuel and gas shortage 
in Libreville. All domestic flights will be suspended until 8 
May unless a solution is found between now and then, airline 
sources say. However, national Air Gabon Airlines are 
maintaining international flights. Gas stations have not 
received supplies since 2 May and a lot of them, even though 
pump attendants are not participating in the strike, have had to 
stop distributing fuel. It is also impossible to find gas 
cylinders, which are distributed by the petroleum companies."]

  [Excerpts] The prime minister and first vice president, 
Honorable John Malecela, continued to hold separate talks in 
Arusha town today with the representatives of the Rwanda 
Government and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] delegations. 
The prime minister held talks with the heads of the delegations 
separately following the RPF's refusal to recognize the interim 
government installed in Rwanda following the death of President 
Juvenal Habyarimana on 6 April. [passage omitted] 
  Hon. Malecela has stressed that peace in Rwanda depended 
entirely on both sides solving the ongoing crisis. The 
Government of Tanzania is compiling a joint communique on the 
talks to be signed separately by the leaders of the Government 
of Rwanda and the RPF delegations. The identical documents will 
be signed on behalf of the Tanzanian Government by the 
representative and coordinator of the talks, Tanzanian Prime 
Minister John Malecela, and the United Nations' and OAU 
representatives. Reliable sources say that the communique 
stresses three important points which Hon. John Malecela 
mentioned yesterdayl. These points are an end to the fighting 
and killing of innocent citizens, open channels for relief 
supplies to reach the citizens of Rwanda, and the Arusha 
agreement is to be implemented.

  [Text] Nairobi, 5 May (AFP) -- Army and rebel fighters 
pounded central Kigali with shells Thursday [5 May] in a fierce 
battle for control of Rwanda's embattled capital after the 
latest attempt to launch peace talks failed. A mortar round 
slammed into the airport near the arrivals building minutes 
after a UN plane carrying food and medicine landed amid a 
barrage of small arms fire. 
  The plane was forced to take off again without unloading, 
said UN spokesman Abdul Kabia. "It looks like it was an attack 
on our plane, but things are so confused here that we are not 
sure who was targeting us," Kabia told AFP by telephone from 
Kigali. 
  Gunbattles raged all night throughout Kigali and heavy 
mortar 
fire resumed Thursday morning. "It was intensive, it was right 
through the night, and it's still going on this morning," Kabia 
said. 
  Fighting between the Hutu-led government army and the mainly 
Tutsi rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front escalated sharply Wednesday. 
Relief officials said the rebels had apparently launched what 
they intended as a final onslaught on the government forces, 
some of whom may no longer be under the control of the Army 
command. The number of casualties was unknown. 
  The United Nation's latest bid to bring the two sides to the 
negotiating table in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha 
collapsed Wednesday night because the rebels refused to 
negotiate with the "government of killers" which they consider 
illegitimate. RPF chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe spent two days in 
Arusha, but never met government ministers who said they had 
hoped that the rebels would agree to negotiate a ceasefire. 
  The United Nations meanwhile continued negotiating with 
government forces for permission to evacuate about 300 Tutsi 
refugees pinned down for weeks at a hotel guarded by UN troops 
in a government-held area, Kabia said. Soldiers and militiamen 
armed with machetes attacked a UN convoy carrying 62 Tutsis to 
the airport Wednesday, severely wounding seven of the refugees. 
More than 100,000 Rwandans have been butchered in a month-long 
bloodbath triggered by the April 6 death of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana, a Hutu, in an alleged rocket attack on his plane.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has no 
intention to negotiate with the illegitimate government in 
Rwanda. The chairman of the RPF, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, 
has been in Tanzania to explain the RPF position that what is 
needed in Rwanda now is not negotiations and mediation, but 
Rwanda needs material aid. Rwanda also needs to bring to 
justice those who are responsible for the massacres that have 
been taking place in Rwanda. 
  The RPF chairman said that Rwanda does not need another 
Arusha peace agreement. The peace agreement was signed after 12 
months of negotiations only to be derailed by the same people 
who are now calling for negotiations with the RPF. These are 
the members of the self-imposed government in Rwanda. [passage 
omitted] 
  It's only yesterday that this government murdered 21 orphans 
and three Red Cross workers who were taking care of the orphans 
in Butare Prefecture. While they call for negotiations with the 
RPF, members of the illegitimate government in Rwanda are 
holding the entire nation hostage. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] There has been a new upsurge of tension in 
Rwanda. Yesterday evening three UNAMIR [UN Aid Mission in 
Rwanda] soldiers were injured during shelling of the airport, 
and seven Rwandans were also injured as the UN attempted to 
evacuate them from a hotel in the town center. [passage omitted] 
  In neighboring Tanzania, since yesterday the UN special 
representative has been stepping up his informal talks with the 
warring sides. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh was due to go to Kampala 
this morning to meet the Ugandan president and then return to 
Arusha. The Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, for its part has 
already described any possible intervention by foreign troops in 
Rwanda as too late and pointless, because, the RPF says, the 
genocide has already been committed. This is a view which is 
not shared by the planning minister of the interim government. 
Speaking on a stopover in Dakar, he called for rapid 
intervention by a foreign force. Augustin Ngirabatware was 
speaking to Nicolas Balique: 
  [Begin Ngirabatware recording] I am issuing an appeal to the 
international community to help the people. We also expect the 
international community to use its powers of persuasion with the 
RPF to make it understand that only a peaceful solution will 
allow Rwandans to live together. Third, this international 
force -- which should be neutral but very effective -- should be 
deployed in Rwanda as rapidly as possible -- this is extremely 
urgent -- in order to help the government and the RPF to 
maintain the cease-fire, and to permit the negotiations to begin 
again; and speaking about a neutral, effective international 
force, the Rwandan Government does not rule out any country, but 
we believe that in any case, as far as any direct or indirect 
involvement is concerned, the official armed forces of Uganda 
should not participate in it, and the Burundi Army should not 
participate in it. As far as the Belgian Army is concerned, I 
believe that Belgium has already decided not to take part in 
this kind of force in Rwanda. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Now for our interview: Philippe Gaillard, 
representative of the ICRC in Kigali in Rwanda. A few moments 
ago we heard him talking about the deterioration of the 
situation on the ground today. Now Philippe Gaillard speaks 
first of all about the successful evacuation of 350 Rwandan 
orphans to Zaire yesterday. He spoke to Catherine Nina: 
  [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Nina] Mr. Gaillard, the 
ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] is also working 
in the rest of the country. What is the current situation? 
  [Gaillard] There is no region, no village, in Rwanda which 
has escaped the violence. It was known that 220,000 to 250,000 
people have fled the southwest of Rwanda to take refuge in 
Tanzania. The day before yesterday, thanks to remarkable 
cooperation from the Tanzanian and Rwandan Red Cross, we managed 
to distribute four days' worth of food, so that they can 
survive, at least for the next four days. We carried out this 
distribution in one day, for 220,000 people. 
  That is one thing. Today we are starting to evaluate the 
situation of the civilian populations in the southeast of 
Rwanda, the regions of Kibungo, Rusomo, the Tanzanian frontier 
-- but on the Rwandan side -- because there are all sorts of 
rumors going round as to the fate of the civilian populations 
that have stayed inside the country. I think we shall have a 
reasonably clear picture tomorrow morning, or tomorrow evening 
at the latest, I think. 
  [Nina] What is the situation in Gitarama? 
  [Gaillard] You know, the Rwandan Government is in Gitarama. 
There is a huge number of displaced persons in Gitarama. They 
are mainly people who fled Kigali and who are completely 
destitute. 
  Yesterday morning I received a formal invitation from the 
Rwandan Government to transform -- with the agreement of the 
nuns -- the religious center of Kabgayi, which is the biggest 
religious center in Rwanda, into an ICRC hospital. 
  I think we shall be able to start on an initial distribution 
of food to the displaced persons in the regions of Gitarama and 
Kabgayi at the beginning of next week at the latest. 
  I am not at all optimistic. It seems to me that there is no 
longer any hope of dialogue, that in spite of international 
pressure of various kinds it will be extremely difficult to stop 
this infernal machine which has been set in motion in Rwanda. I 
don't know if I should say it was 6 April [death of 
Habyarimana], three and a half years ago, in 1959 [dates of 
clashes in Rwanda] -- I don't know, it'll be analyzed later -- 
but it is very recent that the despair has been so great on both 
sides that they are ready to push the exercise through to the 
end, and I think we haven't seen the end of the horror.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with CNR President Jacques </F>
Matanda-ma-Mboyo by Rik De Gendt in Brussels; date not given: 
"Zairian Opposition Chooses Armed Action"] 
  [Text] "We will not allow ourselves to be mistreated 
endlessly. Our good will and patience during activities and 
negotiations are completely exhausted. Above all, the Zairian 
people is living in an inhumane situation. For this reason we 
decided to set up an Armed Branch of the Radical Opposition 
[Branche Armee de L'Opposition Radicale]. It seems the only way 
out of the crisis," said Jacques Matanda-ma-Mboyo, member of the 
executive committee of the USORAL [Sacred Union of the Radical 
Opposition and Allies], a broad coalition of opposition parties, 
in an interview with DE STANDAARD. 
  Matanda comes from Bandundu. He belongs to a generation of 
young politicians who have never served under President Mobutu 
Sese Seko and now "wants to make a new sound heard." He is 
president of the Confederation of Reformist Nationalists (CNR) 
[Confederation des Nationalistes Reformateurs], a political 
pressure party which is part of the USORAL. He played an 
important role in organizing the so-called "dead city" days of 
protest which entirely paralyzed urban life. 
  On 22 March 1993, Matanda was offered the position of deputy 
interior minister in the transitional government of Etienne 
Tshisekedi, but he declined the offer. "I could not reconcile 
myself with the endless dirty tricks of men who are looking out 
mainly or exclusively for their own interests," he said. 
"Nearly all of them had eaten out of Mobutu's hand in the past 
and they are still under his influence. I decided to withdraw 
and leave the country to take a more effective path with some 
people thinking along the same lines," he said. 
  For three months, Matanda lived in Angola and for another 
month and a half he lived in the turbulent Congo town of 
Brazzaville. There he realized "that you can only get some 
rulers on their knees and break through the suffering of 
inhumane situations under the pressure of armed action. The 
history of Israel, South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe provide 
abundant proof of that," he said. He then made contact with 
armed opposition groups in Uganda and Tanzania and took the 
South African ANC as an example. From Europe, he is now making 
the final preparations for his activities. 
  "We are not planning a conventional war," Matanda explained. 
"Rather we are planning well prepared commando actions which can 
escape the reach of even a large and trained military apparatus 
like Mobutu's. It will make him mad and eventually make him 
surrender. We are hoping for a good deal of support from the 
diaspora and are counting ultimately on a mobilization from 
Kinshasa and inside the country." 
  Matanda lost his belief in any political solution due to 
both 
the stubbornness and untrustworthiness of President Mobutu and 
the high- handed intervention of Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo as 
chairman first of the National Sovereign Conference and later of 
the High Council of the Republic and the extended transitional 
parliament. 
  "Mobutu has never kept his word and will not do so tomorrow. 
It does not harm him that the people is starving. He is clever 
and knows how to turn every situation and every agreement to his 
advantage. Monsengwo became the victim of that and in turn the 
prelate did not hesitate, especially in his international 
contacts, to push aside the representatives of the Zairian 
people and follow his own path. Both men believe that they are 
above any law and that we must dance to their tune for ever. In 
fact, one is the other's hostage. We want to break this circle 
of power and suffering in the shortest possible time," Matanda 
said.

  [Text] President-elect Nelson Mandela will announce his new 
cabinet next Wednesday [11 May]. ANC spokesperson Ronnie 
Mamoepa said in Johannesburg that Mr. Mandela had a free hand in 
choosing the cabinet. The party's National Executive Committee 
had asked that Mr. Mandela and a committee of six senior 
officials to name the cabinet. Apparently no decision has yet 
been taken on whether Mr. Cyril Ramaphosa or Mr. Thabo Mbeki 
will be a vice president.

  [Text] The cabinet has decided to declare 10 May, the date 
of the inauguration of the new president, a public holiday. The 
cabinet said in a statement it was well aware that the recent 
series of unscheduled public holidays had created serious 
disruptions and problems for organized commerce and industry. 
However, it had received strong recommendations in favor of the 
day being a public holiday from the Transitional Executive 
Council and the National Inauguration Committee.

  [Text] Government and UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] negotiators have met to try to narrow 
their differences and deal once and for all with the modalities 
for the second round of presidential elections. No plausible 
and conclusive progress was made at this afternoon's meeting. 
The two negotiating teams will return tomorrow to the 
Mulungushi International Conference Center for direct talks to 
try to resolve the differences. Consensus is expected to be 
reached tomorrow. This evening the two delegations will try to 
improve on their ideas. Should this happen, the talks will only 
need to deal with national reconciliation issues. 
  An official source has told us that Blondin Beye leaves 
Lusaka for South Africa tomorrow to attend president-elect 
Nelson Mandela's inauguration.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] For several weeks now, the Liberian peace process 
has been threatened by factional fighting within the ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
organization. Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo faction has been 
battling with Roosevelt Johnson's Krahns. They have been 
fighting each other at the headquarters town of Tubmanburg, at 
the Po River Bridge, and most recently at Clay Junction, just 
outside Monrovia. The international peacekeeping force has been 
powerless to stop the conflict, and it has been unclear who was 
in control of Tubmanburg. Our correspondent, Nii Nartey 
Allison, has just been there and sent this report. 
  Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo fighters are well in control of 
Tubmanburg. Koromah's field commander, Mohamed Dumbuya, said 
today in Tubmanburg that his forces are back in control of the 
highway town of Clay and were poised to seize the Po River 
Bridge getaway to ULIMO-controlled Bomi County. He said forces 
loyal to Alhaji Koromah were today tightening their grip on the 
villages of Sastown, Amadu Town, and Combat Camp, all of which 
around the Clay to Po River highway. Mr. Dumbuya said: We will 
fight until there is victory, even if we have to fight for the 
next 100 years. 
  Meanwhile, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] chief of staff, General Femi 
Williams, urged the warring tribes in ULIMO to allow the free 
movement of peacekeeping troops in their areas as they had 
agreed to earlier. He said the roads are to be kept open without 
conditions and warned that ECOMOG will not entertain any further 
move by ULIMO that endangers the life and property of innocent 
people. The ECOMOG chief of staff also said: We will not relent 
in our efforts until a peaceful resolution of the ULIMO crisis 
is achieved.

  [Text] Has Leonard Nyangoma, minister of the interior and 
of security, been dismissed in Burundi, or did he resign, as was 
originally believed? The question remains unanswered. As we 
know, Nyangoma is a hard-liner of the Front for Democracy in 
Burundi [Frodebu], and the government recently distanced itself 
from his remarks. Muriel Pomponne put some questions to the 
Burundi prime minister, and Anatole Kanyenkiko contented himself 
with answering that he has not seen his interior minister for a 
long time: 
  [Begin recording] [Kanyenkiko] The minister ended his 
mission 
on 25 April, and we note that he has not yet returned. This 
situation is quite awkward because we do not know the reasons 
for this delay. 
  [Pomponne] If Mr. Nyangoma has not returned, could he be 
considered to have resigned? 
  [Kanyenkiko] I note that he is putting himself in the 
position of deserting of his post, but I hope he does not go as 
far as that. It is not a question of dismissal. The 
government's policy combines a return to peace and security and 
collaboration with all political partners and all authorities, 
and if someone sets himself against this, then he is thwarting 
the government's policy and the government's policy has to be 
credible. 
  [Pomponne] Do you consider that Mr. Nyangoma has sometimes 
gone against the government line? 
  [Kanyenkiko] Yes, as you will have noted in his remarks. 
  [Pomponne] Do you consider that he is one of the instigators 
behind the armed militias in the northern regions of the capital? 
  [Kanyenkiko] With regard to this question, we leave it up to 
the judicial system to shed light on this matter. All we can 
tell you is that today the disarmament operation has borne fruit 
in so far as Kamenge, Kinama, and Cibitoke have become calm once 
again and normal activities have resumed. [end recording]

Gabonese citizens or local companies which have been deprived of

  [Excerpts] The interim Government of Rwanda today signed 
the agreement to stop fighting and end massacres in the country. 
This was stated today by Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph 
Rwegasira following the two-day session in Arusha which was 
convened again by the special facilitator in the Rwandan crisis, 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi. The meetings were chaired by the 
prime minister and first vice president, Honorable John 
Malecela, on behalf of President Mwinyi, and were attended by 
representatives of the interim Government of Rwanda and the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]. Minister Rwegasira said that 
Malecela met and held talks separately with both sides because 
the RPF delegation refused to sit at the same table as the 
Rwandan interim government delegation. 
  Minister Rwegasira added that although the government 
delegation signed the peace proposal tabled by the facilitator, 
the RPF refused to sign it but they were ready to stop fighting 
as proposed. [passage omitted including indistinct portion] 
Despite refusing to sign the agreement, the RPF has agreed to 
implement it with effect from the day after tomorrow, 7 May in 
the areas it occupies throughout the country. 
  The final signing ceremony was attended by the OAU 
secretary- 
general Dr. Salim Ahmad Salim, representatives of all the 
Western ambassadors in Tanzania, and other observers from the 
member countries of the UN Security Council. 
  Hon. Malecela returned to Dodoma town today.

  [Text] Nairobi, 6 May (AFP) -- Shells blasted central 
Kigali as the Army and rebels fought fierce artillery duels 
Friday [6 May] despite a ceasefire agreement announced by 
Tanzanian officials. "There is shelling around us, and there has 
been continuous intensive fighting throughout the night," UN 
spokesman Abdul Kabia said. "The battle area has spread over 
various parts of Kigali." 
  Tanzanian Foreign Minister Joseph Rwegasira announced in Dar 
es Salaam that Rwanda's interim government had signed a document 
calling for a ceasefire starting Saturday. He said the rebel 
Rwanda Patriotic Front did not sign, but had promised to observe 
the ceasefire. Rebel officials were not immediately available 
to comment. 
  Kabia told AFP by telephone from Kigali that fighting had 
also been reported around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, 
where relief officials said mainly Tutsi rebel guerrillas were 
besieging Hutu-led government forces. Clashes also erupted 
elsewhere in the country and spread in the corpse-littered and 
blood-splattered capital. Shells fell near the Mille Collines 
Hotel in central Kigali, where about 300 Tutsi civilians have 
been holed up for weeks under UN protection. Government 
soldiers and militiamen have prevented UN forces from evacuating 
them. 
  The rebel headquarters at the former parliament building was 
"very heavily shelled and received two direct hits" Thursday, 
Kabia said. Casualty figures were unknown.

  [Excerpts] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has called 
upon the UN Security Council to condemn the genocide being 
committed in Rwanda and set up a tribunal to try those who have 
been committing these crimes, beginning with October 1990 up to 
now. 
  In a letter to the UN Security Council dated 1 May 1994, the 
RPF said that the massacres in Rwanda have been two-pronged: 
First, to eliminate all the political opponents of President 
Habyarimana's MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development] and CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the 
Republic], and second, the massacres have been intended to 
exterminate people of Tutsi origin. 
  The RPF says that the neo-Nazi ideology in Rwanda is using 
the news that Tutsi people originated from Ethiopia and should 
be therefore thrown into rivers [word indistinct] which will 
eventually lead them back to Ethiopia. The massacres have 
claimed more than 500,000 people [as heard] and the number is 
increasing every hour. 
  The RPF states that the international community should go 
after these criminals in Rwanda who are committing genocide in 
contravention of the UN convention against genocide adopted on 9 
December 1948. This genocide has been planned for some time but 
was put into effect when the RPF started an open confrontation 
with Habyarimana's dictatorship. [passage omitted] 
  The death of President Habyarimana was used as a pretext to 
escalate the massacres in Rwanda. The massacres are continuing 
to this day, organized by the illegitimate government in Rwanda. 
The RPF requests the UN Security Council to isolate this 
government on all fronts. The RPF is willing to furnish more 
evidence on the genocide in Rwanda if it is requested to do so. 
This letter to the UN Security Council was signed by the RPF 
chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe.

  [Text] The painfully slow process of the Angolan peace 
talks in Lusaka means that the war has continued relentlessly? 
[words indistinct] it seems the government has been taking the 
action to UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola]-held areas, notably N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza 
Norte Province, east of the capital Luanda. There have been 
reports of heavy fighting there, and now the government claims 
to have captured the town. From Luanda Neto Shackson reports: 
  The state's news agency ANGOP [ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY] said 
today government troops captured N'dalatando, but there has been 
no confirmation from military headquarters. UNITA radio two 
days ago reported heavy government shellings to the town, and 
government commander in Dondo, about 100 km south west of 
N'dalatando, told me late last month a government offensive had 
reached positions very close to the town. The matter of who 
controls Huambo in Andola is [words indistinct]. The government 
holds many towns and cities, while UNITA holds most of the 
surrounding countryside. The progress of war is patchy. Last 
month UNITA captured Chongoroi, in the western Province of 
Benguela, and the government newspapers said today there has 
been heavy fighting in the southern government-held town of 
Cuchi. But, as with all military information in Angola, there 
has been no reliable confirmation.

  [Text] The process of demobilizing government forces and 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] troops in Mozambique has 
slowed down in the past couple of weeks almost to a standstill. 
It seems there are rows between the two sides over how many 
troops are actually turning up, disarming and demobilizing. 
There have even been reports that President Chissano has 
suspended the government's demobilization. Well, they have all 
been meeting about it today, and the United Nations is putting 
as brave a face as possible on it, as Barnaby Philips reports 
from Maputo: 
  The UN special representative to Mozambique, Aldo Ajello, 
admitted at the end of tonight's meeting that there are serious 
problems between the government and Renamo, and nothing 
substantial had been resolved, but Mr. Ajello denied reports 
that the government had suspended the demobilization of its 
troops, and government ministers also said that these reports 
were not true. Ministers said the government did stop 
demobilizing for a period last week, but restarted again this 
Tuesday [3 May]. Nevertheless, Mr. Ajello failed tonight in his 
intended aims: Neither the government nor Renamo were prepared 
to commit themselves to a final date to end demobilization. 
Diplomatic sources say the government, in particular, is 
deliberately keeping back many of its best troops from the 
disarmament process. A further snag is the case of what has 
become known of the missing 12,000 Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front] troops. The government is now claiming its 
army is in fact some 12,000 soldiers smaller than was previously 
believed. Renamo has been far from happy with this, believing 
the government may be massaging the figures in order to hide 
soldiers. Mr. Ajello flies to South Africa tomorrow to brief the 
UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the situation. When 
asked if he would be taking an optimistic message to his boss, 
Mr. Ajello replied, it is obvious that a lot more needs to be 
done.

  [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali has proposed the 
withdrawal of 2,000 UN soldiers in Mozambique by May. In a 
report on UN Operations in Mozambique, Unomoz, Butrus-Ghali 
says, however, other reductions before October elections are not 
convenient. In its last resolution on Mozambique, the Security 
Council requested the UN secretary general to present proposals 
for the gradual withdrawal of the soldiers. About 800 Italian 
soldiers who were stationed in the Beira Corridor left 
Mozambique in April, and about 200 others are still in the 
country.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- Thabo Mbeki, named as a 
first deputy-president by African National Congress President 
Nelson Mandela on Friday [6 May], was born in Idutywa, Transkei, 
in June, 1942. 
  His appointment as first deputy-president significantly 
increases his chances as ANC crown prince, favoured to succeed 
Nelson Mandela as leader. He is also the ANC national chairman. 
  Both his parents were teachers and activists. His father, 
Govan, was a university graduate who was later jailed on Robben 
Island for his part in the ANC's campaign against apartheid. 
  Earlier, Govan was a leading figure in ANC activities in the 
Eastern Cape. 
  Thabo Mbeki joined the ANC Youth League at 14 and quickly 
became active in student politics. After his schooling at 
Lovedale was interrupted by a strike in 1959, he completed his 
studies at home. Thereafter, he moved to Johannesburg where he 
came under the guidance of Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe. 
  While studying for his A-levels, he was elected secretary of 
the African Students' Association (ASA). 
  He went on to study economics as a correspondence student 
with London University. 
  The ASA collapsed following the arrest of many of its 
members, at a time when political movements were coming under 
increasingly severe attack from the state. Mbeki's father was 
arrested at Rivonia and sentenced to life imprisonment. 
  Thabo Mbeki left the country in 1962 under orders from the 
ANC. From Tanzania, he moved to Britain where he completed a 
Masters Degree in Economics at Sussex University in 1966. 
Remaining active in student politics, he played a prominent role 
in building the youth and student sections of the ANC in exile. 
  After his studies, he worked at the London office with the 
late Oliver Tambo, who was to become ANC president, and Dr Yusuf 
Dadoo before being sent to the Soviet Union in 1970 for military 
training. 
  Later that year, he arrived in Lusaka where he was soon 
appointed assistant secretary of the revolutionary council. 
  In 1975, he was acting ANC representative in Swaziland. 
  Appointed to the ANC National Executive Committee in 1975, 
he 
served as ANC representative to Nigeria until 1978, then moved 
to Lusaka to become political secretary in the office of Oliver 
Tambo, and then director of information. 
  From this position, he played a major role in turning the 
international media against apartheid. His other role in the 
'70s was in building the ANC in Swaziland and underground 
structures inside South Africa. 
  During the '80s, Mbeki rose to head the Department of 
Information and Publicity and co-ordinated diplomatic campaigns 
to involve more white South Africans in anti-apartheid 
activities.

  [Text] Pretoria May 5 SAPA -- All legislators elected to 
provincial and national government structures, including the 
state president, will pay income tax in terms of the Melamet 
Commission report on remuneration of politicians released on 
Thursday [5 May]. Commission chairman Mr Justice D A Melamet 
said at a press conference in Pretoria the report also 
recommended that all allowances, other than car allowances, be 
abolished. 
  Free housing would be given only to the president and the 
two 
executive deputy presidents and no other housing allowances 
would be allowed for any other grades. According to the report, 
"if any person occupies a state house, a market-related rental 
is to be paid to the state to cover such occupation". 
  "The committee has worked on the premise that all elected 
membe ay income tax on their income as is the case with members 
of the public. It, however, believes and recommends that the 
right in relation to the pensions of an ex-state or 
ex-vice-president and their spouses should continue to exist and 
should not be taxed," Mr Justice Melamet said. 
  The new state president will receive R575,000 [rand] 
(R409,000 after deductions) a year, and his deputies R500,000 
(R338,247). The figures do not include allowances. Asked if 
the amount was in line with what President-elect Nelson Mandela 
had been preaching, that his salary would not be excessive, Mr 
Justice Melamet said Mr Mandela and the present cabinet had 
approved the salary scale. "In fact Mr Mandela was happy with 
the recommendations of the commission because he would be taxed 
and treated like any other member of the public," Mr Justice 
Melamet said. 
  He said the scale was in line with that of international 
countries and his committee, which was made up of people from 
various sectors, was sure the scale was comparable with that of 
the private sector. According to Mr Justice Melamet the 
committee, in its recommendations, used a number of principles 
to provide a basis for remuneration in the parliamentary system. 
These included that the system should attract the best people 
available for parliamentary duty; encourage individual growth 
and participation in work teams and parliamentary committees; 
encourage parliamentary work as a career; and provide for 
transparency of the principles and pay involved. 
  The committee recommended a grading structure of the various 
offices in the national legislature and for the new offices 
provided for in the Constitution Act of 1993. It recommended 
that all allowances where applicable, other than car allowances, 
be abolished and incorporated in the basic salary attributed to 
each post in the grading system. Parliamentarians, other than 
the state president and executive deputy president, are to be 
entitled to two free journeys a month for private use during a 
parliamentary session between their home base and back. 
  Each incumbent is entitled to an allowance in respect of a 
private motor car (which can also be used for official purposes) 
of 20 per cent of the basic salary of the incumbent. 
  The committee also recommended that a pension fund along the 
lines of those existing in the private sector be established for 
politicians and had made further recommendations on the 
envisaged pension dispensation. It was, however, pointed out 
that certain provisions of the 1993 Constitution had to be 
amended to enable the introduction of the pension arrangement 
recommended. 
  According to the commission it was also noted that the 
present medical benefit scheme was operating successfully and, 
although the contributions were high, the benefits were 
generous. The committee recommended that the medical scheme be 
continued and made a number of recommendations for the 
consideration of the scheme's management committee to bring 
costs more in line with commercial schemes. 
  According to Mr Justice Melamet, the commission has also 
drafted a bill for the establishment of a permanent commission 
on remuneration of representatives envisaged in sections of the 
constitution of the Republic of South Africa. "More 
specifically the bill deals with matters relating to the objects 
of the (permanent) commission, its constitution, remuneration, 
powers, duties and functions as well as meetings of the 
commission, the funding of its activities and the powers of the 
president," Mr Justice Melamet said.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- The Independent Electoral 
Commission [IEC] has declared South Africa's April 26-29 general 
election substantially free and fair. Making the announcement 
at Midrand near Johannesburg on Friday afternoon, IEC Chairman 
Mr Justice Johann Kriegler, on behalf of the 16 commissioners, 
said this was in spite of objections and complaints from 
political parties. 
  "The election was admittedly flawed, but that is peripheral. 
Some 20-million people of this land were granted a say in the 
government of this country. 
  "The electorate was offered a reasonable opportunity to 
vote. 
When it came to counting, once again disaster was averted. 
Alleged electoral violations occurring during the voting and 
counting periods will be investigated and where appropriately 
investigated. 
  "We were able to establish the will of the people with 
reasonable accuracy," said Mr Justice Kriegler. 
  With regard to claims of electoral fraud in KwaZulu/Natal, 
the IEC chairman said there were problems there with counting of 
ballots. 
  Therefore, a reliable test of the vote would be to justify 
it 
proportionately to the proven support of the parties in that 
province. 
  He then proceeded to announce the tally of each party 
indicating the African National Congress had received 62.65 per 
cent of the total number of counted ballots, with the National 
Party receiving 20.4 per cent of the tally. 
  The Inkatha Freedom Party was third with 10.5 per cent of 
the 
vote, while the Freedom Front received 2.2 per cent. 
  Close to 20 million votes were counted, of which the ANC 
received just over 12 million votes. 
  In terms of the National Assembly seats for each party, the 
ANC has 252 seats, the NP [National Party] has 82, the IFP 
[Inkatha Freedom Party] 43, the Freedom Front receives nine, the 
Democratic Party receives seven, the Pan Africanist Congress 
gets five and the African Christian Democratic Party receives 
two seats. 
  Seats for the provincial legislatures were later read out. 
  Concluding the briefing, the IEC noted that five parties, 
the African National Congress, the National Party, the 
Democratic Party, the Freedom Front and the Pan-Africanist 
Congress have candidates who have been elected to more than one 
house. 
  "They must decide as soon as possible to which house they 
send the persons. The IEC will communicate with them," said the 
commission.

<F P=106> [Reyort by David Greybe] </F>
  [Text] Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] chairman 
Judge Johann Kriegler yesterday said he expected the election 
results to be manipulated to resolve political disputes and 
election irregularities. There was nothing wrong with this, he 
said. In fact he welcomed it. "Let's not get overly squeamish 
about it. They (parties) are in a power game with one another, 
and if they want to settle on the basis that they withdraw 
objections there's nothing wrong with it, ethically or legally," 
he said. The IEC would "certainly not stand in the way" and, if 
asked, would assist. 
  He wanted to make one thing clear: "We (IEC) have never been 
asked to certify that the result is accurate. We have been 
asked to certify that the particular political process is 
substantially free and fair." There would be "verneukery" 
(crookery), but what mattered was its effect on the outcome of 
the elections. "You can't work in a brothel and remain chaste." 
  With only 10 days in which to certify the elections, and 
mindful that the presidential inauguration was scheduled for 
Tuesday, the ordinary process for hearing complaints was "quite 
clearly not available." "We have to make an assessment on 
available data," Kriegler said. 
  IEC commissioner Dikgang Moseneke said if complaints were 
not 
resolved between parties, the IEC would make the final judgment. 
"We have vast powers ... to make some adjustments." 
  The political horse trading to save the elections -- to 
ensure they could be declared free and fair -- began last 
Friday. A source in the President's office said that at a 
crisis meeting attended by President F.W. de Klerk and ANC 
president Nelson Mandela, Kriegler was offered access to state 
resources to help the IEC complete its task. 
  Kriegler than met TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] 
management committee members Cyril Ramaphosa, Roelf Meyer and 
Joe Slovo. Slovo said this week that in the end it had been 
decided not to assist the IEC "because it may have been 
construed as the TEC taking over the IEC." 
  At Friday's meeting, De Klerk and Mandela initially accused 
the judge of not doing his job properly, the source said. But 
they decided to do everything possible to rescue the process. 
"The judge admitted that the elections were a shambles," the 
source said. "The meeting ended up as an exercise in damage 
control." 
  A government source said: "They decided free and fair 
elections had to be declared, come hell or high water." De 
Klerk said he was worried Inkatha Freedom Party president 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi would feel left out, and asked Kriegler to 
call the KwaZulu leader to reassure him that the meeting had 
been part of the process to keep various leaders informed. 
  After the meeting, Kriegler said there was no reason to 
doubt 
that the elections would not be free and fair. De Klerk acted 
swiftly too, when, at a news conference two hours later and 
broadcast live to the nation, he put beyond question any doubts 
that the elections would be anything but free and fair. 
  Ramaphosa also poured oil on trouble waters, telling a news 
conference on Saturday: "Despite all the problems that were 
experienced during the election campaign we believe that the 
election itself has been run on a free and fair basis, and we 
would like to applaud the IEC which was charged with Mission 
Impossible."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Democratic Party boss Tony Leon is heading for 
Parliament determined to find out why the election turned into 
such a "shambles." We would wish him well but do not believe he 
will get far while he has to contend with political parties 
determined that the election shall be declared free and fair, 
and with the dissembling of Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] head Judge Johann Kriegler. 
  The delays in counting have cast doubt over the election and 
everything flowing from it. That is hardly surprising as the 
delays are due to the chaos at Nasrec [exhibition center] and 
the political horse trading over what many believe to have been 
massive electoral fraud in Natal. IEC members were sworn to 
secrecy not just for the duration of the electoral process but 
for ever. Commissioner Kriegler took that as licence to hide the 
full truth of the political deals he has helped cut with major 
parties from the millions of voters whose commitment and hope 
gave the election its value. 
  In the process, Kriegler has called into question his own 
judgment as well as his ability to remain calm under pressure. 
He has also not only seriously damaged his own credibility but 
also that of any declaration on freeness and fairness by the 
IEC. Of course the election will be endorsed by the 
international community, because the alternative cannot be 
contemplated. But we will soon have the farcical situation of 
an incompetently run IEC pronouncing on its own management of 
the election. 
  Newspapers, meanwhile, are being fed a steady stream of 
semi-official statements apparently designed to consolidate 
different parties' positions. They come from as high as 
President de Klerk's office to as low as grassroots party 
branches. The leaks accompany obvious political deal making, 
particularly between the ANC and National Party. It is not 
difficult to suspect that the parties themselves are trying to 
hammer out agreements on vote and power sharing that will keep 
their supporters happy and that will help steer the country away 
from the turmoil that would accompany a declaration that the 
election had not been free and fair. 
  But while Kriegler prevaricates, voters are likely to become 
increasingly sceptical. President-designate Nelson Mandela 
offeed Cabinet posts to parties whose share of the vote was 
below the threshold. It was a statesmanlike move by a man 
committed to the reconciliation this country needs. But it has 
been tarnished by the electoral farce that has left sceptics 
wondering if his offer was necessary to buy the silence of 
parties who had been swamped. 
  Kriegler has to come completely clean, even if that exposes 
his own incompetence and that of the electoral machine he has 
headed. He cannot be allowed to go on treating his fellow South 
Africans as fools by hiding the truth behind inane 
philosophising on what the election was about. Elections 
worldwide have problem areas, but if they do not materially 
affect the outcome of the polls they are generally accepted. 
South Africans need to be told precisely what that means across 
this country. If the Natal vote was excessively flawed by 
fraud, some means must be found to hold the election in the 
province again. If there are doubts about the competency of the 
election in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], they 
must be discussed openly and the public told if political 
compromise has been necessary. 
  If we are to be given a Parliament whose composition is 
determined post-election by party horse trading, we need to be 
told. We, the people who endorsed South Africa's first universal 
franchise, understand that realpolitik may be necessary to 
obtain a broadly acceptable electoral result. But we are also 
entitled to open disclosure of the compromises the political 
bosses have felt necesary. South Africans can no longer be 
treated as children.

  [Text] Durban May 5 SAPA -- Controversy surrounding claims 
of electoral fraud in KwaZulu/Natal continued on Thursday [5 
May] after individual Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] 
officials charged the elections were not free and fair in the 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] stronghold of Zululand. 
  A letter apparently drafted by the Empangeni sub-region of 
the IEC and leaked to SAPA's Durban office said "pending the 
commissioner's decision our impression of elections in this sub- 
region is that they were not free and fair". 
  Electoral officer for the lower Umfolozi area, Jan Riekert, 
told SAPA late on Thursday night that in his opinion the 
election in the area had been free and fair. Mr Riekert said 
reports of irregularities in the electoral procedure had not 
been substantiated and he was satisfied that complaints that 
ballot boxes had been tampered with had been satisfactorily 
resolved. The ballot boxes had been set aside and had not been 
included in the count. 
  Mr Riekert conceded, however, that local IEC staff had 
expressed reservations about the freeness and fairness of the 
elections in that area at a confidential meeting on Wednesday. 
"It was purely an opinion poll among ourselves...And was not a 
specific resolution that was formed," Mr Riekert told SAPA. He 
denied knowledge of the letter, which was reportedly sent to IEC 
headquarters in Johannesburg.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] An almost hotly disputed region in the elections was 
KwaZulu-Natal. The ANC accused the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
of all sorts of trickery, including stuffing ballot boxes and 
setting up pirate polling stations. Inkatha counter-accused the 
ANC of electoral skullduggery. In spite of that it looks as 
though the IFP will be declared the winners in the region. The 
ANC's president, Nelson Mandela, says the elections were free 
and fair and that the KwaZulu problem should not be allowed to 
overshadow that. My colleague Jeremy Skeet talked to the ANC 
Chief in Natal Harry Gwala, and asked him what he would do if 
Inkatha was declared the winner. 
  [Begin recording] [Gwala] If they are declared winners, and 
with our protest -- we are making a fresh start. First time we 
go for democratic elections in this country. We will protest, 
but we won't seek to upset the apple cart. I am speaking for 
the leadership now, but the leadership will have a problem here, 
and then there is a serious problem. It may not be able to 
contain the masses on the ground. 
  [Skeet] But what is your message to the comrades going to 
be? 
  [Gwala] My message is not to my comrades. My message is to 
those who have been conducting the elections, that think of the 
consequences of an announcement you may make, because it may set 
things ablaze. We don't want that sort of thing to happen. My 
message is that you can even exclude Natal for the time being. 
Hold celebrations of whatever you can, get the thing properly 
sorted out before you make any announcements. 
  [Skeet] Don't you think the IEC [Independent Electoral 
Commission] is in a difficult position? You have said stop the 
announcement, but the Inkatha would say if we don't win this 
there is also going to be trouble. 
  [Gwala] No, they don't have to announce. They have got to 
take the matter to the government and wait for a political 
decision. 
  [Skeet] So, you think that South Africa's first elections 
should be decided on a political level? 
  [Gwala] If they could not be decided on the ballot boxes, 
then we could have done something else, but here we are 
satisfied that there were irregularities here and there -- I am 
talking about other provinces now -- but you are not talking of 
irregularities in Natal. We talking of downright corruption.

  [Text] The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] has asked the IEC 
[Independent Electoral Commission] chairman, Mr. Justice Johan 
Kriegler, for an immediate police investigation into allegations 
of massive cheating at the IEC Headquarters in Johannesburg. 
The IFP said that there was increasing evidence of fraud to 
boost the ANC's votes. The party said it had received 
information from IEC officials alleging that the officials at 
headquarters had cheated with the results, until Mr. Piet 
Collaigne of the IEC was called in to stop the practice. 
  The IFP also alleged that two card carrying ANC members 
employed by the IEC had asked the commission to declare the 
election in KwaZulu-Natal null and void. The IEC has denied the 
allegations, calling them false and defamatory. The IFP was 
asked to make any information it had available to the IEC and 
the police immediately.

  [Text] South Africans should know by this afternoon, an 
entire week after the election, what the final results are. In 
a communique issued late last night the Independent Electoral 
Commisison said the tallies for both the national and provincial 
legislatures would be out by 2 o'clock. 
  But there is still a major hitch with unconfirmed reports 
indicating that the KwaZulu/Natal election may have to be 
reheld. This follows recommendations by the IEC that voting 
north of the Tugel River be declared null and void because of 
large-scale electoral fraud. 
  Echoing this call the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] premier 
candidate for the province, Dr. Frank Mdlalose, suggested that a 
voter's role be used to eliminate any irregularities. The 
controversy surrounding vote counting irregularities will come 
under the spotlight today when President F.W. de Klerk and the 
president elect, Nelson Mandela, meet in Cape Town to discuss 
the new cabinet.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- Comments by a senior 
Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] member, Arthur Konigkramer, on the 
Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] were false and 
defamatory, the IEC charged on Thursday [5 May] night. 
  On Wednesday Mr Konigkramer, Inkatha campaign manager, 
accused the IEC of colluding with the African National Congress 
in alleging massive voting irregularities. "It (is) typical of 
IEC bungling which has severely compromised the position of 
voters supporting the IFP," he said in a statment. 
  But on thursday night the IEC said: "The attention of the 
commission has been drawn to the statement issued in Durban by 
Mr Arthur Konigkramer of the IFP... 
  "Mr Konigkramer's central allegation is both false and 
defamatory, not only of the commissioners and staff of the IEC 
but also of the accountants drawn from leading firms of auditors 
who have assisted the IEC in the completion of the counting of 
the results. 
  "In this regard, the commission reserves its position. 
Doubtless others who feel themselves to have been similarly 
impugned, will do the same. 
  "In the interim, Mr Konigkramer is invited to submit any 
evidence he may have relating to his various allegations both to 
the commission and to the South African Police as a matter of 
urgency."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- Temporary voter's cards 
were issued to 3.5 million people, the South Africa Free 
Elections [SAFE] fund said in a statement on Thursday [5 May]. 
The cards were issued by 1,500 teams of the Temporary Voter's 
Card Task Force established by SAFE and the Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC], assisted by the Department of Home 
Affairs and the management consulting firm Xcel. 
  "The Department of Home Affairs had maintained that most 
potential voters already had their identity documents and that 
only approximately 500,000 people would need to obtain temporary 
voter's cards prior to the election," the SAFE statement said. 
"Representatives from SAFE, however, after investigations in 
several regions, urged the IEC to focus on this issue and 
predicted that millions of South Africans would be shut out of 
the elections if an extraordinary effort to issue temporary 
voter's cards was not made." 
  SAFE, a US-based organisation, said it had provided 
personnel, 700 cameras and 20,000 rolls of film to the task 
force. It had raised R30 million [rand] for the elections and 
supported 52 voter education programmes.

<F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>
  [Text] Anti-trust legislation remains a priority in the new 
South Africa and will follow British competition policy, says 
Tito Mboweni of the ANC's economics department. Mboweni said 
yesterday legislation was currently being drafted, but that 
there was no clarity about when it would be implemented. "I 
would stress that we're not plotting the downfall of companies 
-- the legislation will simply provide a framework for effective 
competition in the South African economy." 
  Mboweni said anti-trust measures existed in most countries, 
and more so in the developed world. Companies which had 
suffered from the activities of monopolies and cartels were 
strongly in favour of the move, he said. "Those who have 
benefited, obviously aren't." 
  In an interview, Mboweni said he hoped that anti-trust 
legislation would lead to greater competition domestically as 
well as internationally and would break up the concentration of 
economic power. He said there was a long way to go for full 
black empowerment. 
  Mboweni thought many South African companies were going 
about 
affirmative action in "completely the wrong way" and said the 
ANC had no intention of introducing quotas. "Putting Africans 
in highly visible positions without giving them authority has 
inflated the cost of affirmative action." 
  "Many black people are now beyond the reach of some 
companies 
and this action has promoted the tendency for black people to 
`job hop' for the highest salary, rather than for job 
satisfaction." Mboweni said companies should not lose sight of 
the fact that affirmative action was not the exclusive domain of 
one group, but included coloureds, black and white women and the 
disabled. 
  Mboweni said some consultants had made a killing advising 
companies on affirmative action -- in most cases wrongly. 
However, the situation would become clearer once a framework 
for affirmative action had been legislated, he said. "There 
will be no quotas, but from now onwards any hiring, promotion or 
salary structures should be completely free of discrimination 
and staffing should reflect the demographics of our society." 
  Mboweni said anti-trust legislation was a cornerstone of 
building the economy, as outlined in the ANC's Reconstruction 
and Development Programme (RDP). The anti-trust authority would 
be independent of government, he said. "The British system is 
based on a separation of powers to give integrity and 
transparency." 
  Four bodies in Britain formed the competition authorities -- 
the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Office of Fair 
Trading (OFT), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) and 
the Restrictive Practices Court (RPC). "The investigating 
authority, usually the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), initiates 
the inquiry, but doesn't make a judgment on the issue. This is 
done by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) or, in the 
case of restrictive practices, by the Restrictive Practices 
Court." 
  However, South African anti-trust legislation would not copy 
the British system exactly, but would be adapted to suit South 
African conditions, he said. Unbundling, the corporate 
community's latest flavour, was not a way to avoid anti-trust, 
he said. "We also tend to focus strongly on interlocking 
directorates and pyramid structures." 
  Mboweni said it was hoped that a commission looking into 
these matters would shortly come up with recommendations. 
Analysts yesterday said the concentration of economic power in 
South Africa had evolved over the years, due in part to foreign 
exchange regulations, the absorption of local interests from 
disinvesting foreign holding companies, a non-growth closed 
economy and the lack of a definition of capital gains for tax 
purposes.

  [Text] A former commanding officer of the police's 
Vlakplaas counterinsurgency unit, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de 
Kock, and two unnamed men have been arrested. 
  Their arrests are linked to a recent report by Mr. Justice 
Richard Goldstone, implicating Colonel de Kock and other senior 
policemen in third force activities. The Department of Justice 
has confirmed that the men are being held. They are expected to 
appear in court tomorrow. 
  Lieutenant Colonel de Kock succeeded Captain Dirk Coetsee as 
commander of the Vlakplaas unit. Captain Coetsee was 
responsible for exposing Vlakplaas and security police 
activities in 1989. De Kock has previously been linked to the 
assassination of various anti-apartheid activists. His name was 
linked to an assassination attempt on Captain Coetsee in 1993. 
  Colonel de Kock received a 1 million rand package when he 
left the police last year.

  [Text] Pretoria May 5 SAPA -- A former commanding officer 
of the police's Vlakplaas Training Unit, Lieutenant-Colonel 
Eugene de Kock, and two other people have been arrested, SABC 
[South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports. 
This follows the Goldstone Commission's investigation into third 
force activities allegedly involving the police. The three will 
appear in court shortly. 
  Further arrests were expected overnight on Thursday [5 May], 
according to security sources. 
  The arrests were effected by an international investigation 
team headed by Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. Lt-Col 
de Kock was arrested at the International Police Association pub 
in Pretoria on Wednesday night. 
  Dr d'Oliveira said on Thursday night he would have a 
complete 
report on Friday morning. He said he had left teams to effect 
more arrests during the night at their discretion. 
  They were operating according to a certain programme, and he 
would be told of any crisis during the course of the night. 
  Mr Justice Richard Goldstone said on Thursday night it would 
be inappropriate for him to comment. 
  Official police spokesmen said they had been kept in the 
dark 
about the operation, and did not know who the arresting officers 
were or where detainees were being kept. 
  The Goldstone report, released by outgoing State President F 
W de Klerk, recorded allegations of police officers having been 
involved in secret projects to run guns to the Inkatha Freedom 
Party. Three police generals, including Deputy Commissioner 
Lt-Gen Basie Smit, were put on compulsory leave after the 
Goldstone report was made public but were later reinstated. Gen 
Smit and Lt-Gen Krappies Engelbrecht this week announced their 
retirement.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 5 SAPA -- The National Union of 
Mineworkers [NUM] said Thursday it was concerned about the role 
of South African Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe and 
of Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission] in the aborted sales of 
1,000 semi-automatic rifles to KwaZulu Police as revealed by the 
Goldstone Commission. 
  A preliminary hearing by the commission said on Wednesday it 
was unfortunate Gen van der Merwe had not consulted Minister of 
Law and Order Hernus Kriel before authorising an export permit 
for 1,000 LM4 rifles destined for the KwaZulu Police. 
  The statement issued by the NUM said the Ministry of Law and 
Order should curtail the general's powers, which appeared to put 
him above the law. NUM said also it seemed as if Eskom 
management was making Gen van der Merwe "a sacrifical lamb in an 
attempt to hide the real facts".

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Lessons in Conciliation -- "The struggle for hegemony in 
KwaZulu/Natal has been transferred largely from the killing 
fields to the political areas, leading mericifully, to a marked 
reduction in the death toll," notes an editorial in Johannesburg 
THE STAR in English on 6 May on page 10. The winner in 
ZwaZulu/Natal should "take a cue" from Hernus Kriel, likely to 
become premier in the Western Cape, and his ANC rival Allan 
Boesak, who have been holding "cordial discussions" on filling 
executive posts. ANC premier-designate in the Northern Transvaal 
Ramathlodi also talks about including members of the Freedom 
Front in his executive. "The rivals for the premiership in 
KwaZulu/Natal, Frank Mdalalose of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] and Jacob Zuma of the ANC, are fortunately, men who know 
that politics is the art of compromise." 
<H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>
  Judge and Be Judged -- An editorial in the Johannesburg 
WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English on 6 to 12 May on page 16 
evaluates what happened to the elections, concluding that "an 
incompetent IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] bungled the 
administration of the election wholly and completely -- it 
couldn't get ballots to the voters, its security systems were 
inadequate, its counting plans non-existent. This opened the way 
to fraud on a massive scale -- but so hopeless was the IEC 
organization that it has been unable to pinpoint the fraud." "By 
last weekend Judge Kriegler has to admit that he had to throw 
aside the rules, the safeguards and what few systems he had in 
place just to get some sort of result. By Wednesday afternoon he 
had to acknowledge that counting accuracy and care had given way 
to horse-trading among the parties. He has ceased to be a judje, 
ruling on accuracy and validity of the result, but a mediator, 
desperately negotiating a result that all parties would accept." 
This is not only the "fault" of Judge Kriegler, there is 
"evidence" of "a Department of Home Affairs `third force' in IEC 
structures." But in the "most tense and sensitive area of all, 
KwaZulu/Natal, the result will be tainted." In an election meant 
to give the people of KwaZulu/Natal a choice, "IEC bungling has 
prevented that and threatens to prolong instability in the 
region" 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Security Forces -- On the day of Nelson Mandela's 
inauguration he will "acquire the instruments of power, which 
have for more than three centuries been deployed to surpress the 
aspirations of the African majority," notes an editorial in the 
Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 6 May on page 16. "The 
government will be confronted with its most formidable challenge 
-- namely securing the loyality of theese forces." "Theres are 
disturbing signals within the ANC, which suggest that the 
responsibility of building popular organizations in civil 
society will be relegated to a secondary function after 
parliamentary responsibilities. If allowed to go unchallenged, 
all gains made so far will come under threat." And it is also 
"important" that "those who have relished in the abundance of 
wealth that this country had to offer, to come to grips with the 
priorities of reconstruction and development," "with the reality 
that there will be less for them from now on." If "defensive 
actions" of "affluent constituencies" are "left unchallenged" 
the ANC "will be in no posaition to ask the poor and working 
constituency to moderate their aspirations." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Task of Inclusivity Not Yet Completed -- "One of the most 
heart-breaking stories of the week was about Dr. Ferdi 
Hartzenberg and 50 of his supporters who gathered at Lichtenburg 
for a symboli protest against the new South Africa," writes 
columnist Willie Kuhn in his "Politial BEELD" column on page 12 
of the Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 29 April. "Dr. 
Hartzenberg declared that they had become a rejected people." 
"Rejected? No one has rejected the Afrikaner collectively. No 
one has robbed them of their freedom. All that happened is that 
those people over whom the Afrikaner for so long ruled 
unilaterally have, with the Afrikaner, become co- rulers of 
South Africa." "There are too few people who realize that the 
Afrikaner's freedom depends on the degree to which other peoples 
in the country have also been liberated." "Dr. Hartzenberg and 
his followers view their flag-raising ceremony as the first step 
on the road to Afrikaner freedom. Many Afrikaners, in fact the 
majority, view the election as the first step on the road to 
freedom. In this way they have become part of the just 
dispensation in which one people and group become equals with 
other peoples and groups. Most Afrikaners and whites do not 
wish to become terrorists and boycotters. They want to be 
useful citizens of a new dispensation. They wish to show by 
example that cooperation in South Africa can succeed." Kuhn 
concludes: "Let us then reach out to those who form the 
shrinking part of an old order. Their fears have not yet been 
assuaged, and it must be the task of others to help them to 
believe that they are not a rejected tribe. They are our 
language and cultural partners. When the lost sons and 
daughters feel themselves free to return, there must be 
happiness. The task of inclusivity has not ended with the 
election." 
  Western Cape a Challenge -- The Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans on 3 May says in a page-8 editorial: "The National 
Party's victory in the Western Cape is one of the highlights of 
the election. It is the only one of the nine provinces where 
the NP beat the ANC -- thanks to strong support among the 
colored community. The NP therefore has a particular 
responsibility in that region to prove, by means of effective 
management and a policy of reconcilation for the whole country, 
that its policy can and will be practically implemented. In 
short, the NP can make the Western Cape a showcase for its 
policy. If ever the party had an opportunity to apply 
affirmative action in human relations and all that it entails, 
it is in the Western Cape. It is a chance it must grab." 
  Avoid Irresponsible Affirmative Action -- A second editorial 
on page 8 of BEELD says: "One has sympathy for the unenviable 
and almost impossible task the Independent Electoral Commision 
had in arranging the election in such a short time," and "one 
hopes that those who serve in the government of national unity 
as well as members of the new state administration have learned 
a few lessons from the election. The election serves as an 
example of how a country should not be run. If South Africa 
wants to become a success, weak administration, even 
mal-administration, poor training, strikes, waste and 
indiscriminate affirmative action will have to be avoided. The 
new government will have to ensure that people are properly 
trained for their task; that indiscriminate affirmative action 
for political gain is avoided; that people work for their money; 
and that unnecessary strikes which cost the country millions are 
stopped. South Africans voted for a new beginning -- they 
deserve better."

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
said that the top organs of the ruling party KANU [Kenya African 
National Union] will soon meet to discuss the effect of the 
structural adjustment programs on the common man. [passage 
omitted] President Moi was speaking at Jomo Kenyatta 
International Airport soon after arriving from a state visit to 
the peoples' Republic of China. [passage omitted] 
  On the situation in Rwanda, President Moi said it is not 
logical to send a peacekeeping force to that country at present 
as the raging civil war continues. However he appealed to the 
leaders in Rwanda to negotiate an end to the killings before 
seeking such a force. He attributed the killings of thousands 
of people in 1959, 1972, and those dying now to tribalism and 
cautioned Kenyans to remain united to avoid such calamities.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 5 (AFP) -- Talks between Somalia's main 
warring factions have been postponed for the third time, and are 
now scheduled for the end of this month, a United Nations 
spokesman said Thursday [5 May]. 
  "The date that has been proposed by the Somalis themselves 
is 
May 30," spokesman George Bennett told AFP by telephone from 
Mogadishu. 
  The talks to prepare the ground for a national peace and 
reconciliation conference were proposed after Somalia's two 
chief warlords, Mohamed Farah Aidid and self-styled interim 
president Ali Mahdi Mohamed, signed a UN-brokered national 
reconciliation agreement in Nairobi on March 24. 
  Mohamed Awale, a close aide of General Aidid, expressed 
optimism that the meeting would go ahead as planned this time.

  [Text] The Tanzanian chief of general staff, General Robert 
Mboma, has warned Rwandan Government Forces and those from the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front, RPF, that they should not try to cross 
into Tanzania, particularly through the Rusumo Bridge in Ngara 
District, Kagera region. His warning follows reports which say 
that part of the bridge has been in the hands of RPF soldiers on 
the Rwandan side of the border since the end of last month. 
  Speaking after issuing a statement on defense and security 
in 
Ngara District, and after touring the bridge at the border, 
General Mboma said the Rusumo Bridge belonged to Tanzania. He 
told a representative of the RPF chief of general staff, Colonel 
William (Mbagile), that the Kagera River also belonged to 
Tanzania. He warned that Tanzania would not tolerate seeing its 
citizens, who use water from the Kagera River, continue to drink 
water contaminated with corpses from Rwanda. 
  General Mboma also held talks with the Burundi chief of 
general staff, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Bikomagu, who assured him 
that the government and the Burundi Army are making efforts to 
restore peace in their country.

  [Text] Yaounde, 6 May (AFP) -- Cameroonian External 
Relations Minister Ferdinand Leopold Oyono has said that the 
situation in the Bakassi Peninsula remains "potentially 
explosive," adding that less than 1 km separates Cameroonian and 
Nigerian soldiers in this border region of the Gulf of Guinea. 
There is such a concentration "of men and equipment in the area 
that at any moment, anything could happen," he said in a 
statement published today by the pro-government daily CAMEROON 
TRIBUNE. 
  As far as the minister is concerned, the reaction of the UN 
Security Council, before which Cameroon presented its border 
conflict, was favorable to Cameroon, and that in itself 
constitutes "a victory." "Furthermore," he added, "the fact 
that the Security Council endorsed the OAU statement of 4 April 
reiterating the principle of the inviolability of borders 
inherited from the colonial era, is satisfactory on at least two 
scores." "On all the maps drawn up to 1990 Bakassi is 
Cameroonian, only Nigerian maps drawn after this date try to 
show the contrary," the minister pointed out, adding that "when 
the OAU called for the withdrawal of troops from the area, it 
was a thinly veiled allusion to the occupation forces" of 
Nigeria, which has been "increasing its diversionary tactics." 
He expressed satisfaction at the Togolese mediation and 
indicated that Cameroon remained open to dialogue on one 
condition: that "the Nigerian troops withdraw from our national 
territory."

  [Text] Nairobi, May 8 (AFP) -- Rebels and government 
soldiers battled for control of Rwanda's capital Sunday [8 May] 
despite two ceasefire announcements. 
  Gunfire crackled and mortars boomed in central Kigali as 
sporadic battles continued, relief officials and a United 
Nations spokesman said. 
  But fighting slackened off considerably over the weekend 
after a week of fierce artillery duels, they said. 
  UN spokesman Abdul Kabia expressed "cautious optimism" about 
a ceasefire. 
  One ceasefire to start at midnight Saturday was signed by 
Rwanda's interim government in Tanzania last week. 
  The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), which refused to 
negotiate with the government which they consider illegitimate, 
did not sign. 
  But Tanzanian officials said the rebels had promised 
verbally 
to observe the ceasefire. 
  Zaire's ambassador to Belgium said the rebels had signed 
another ceasefire to begin at midnight Sunday. 
  There was no confirmation from the rebels themselves, but 
Kabia said they had asked the UN to send ceasefire monitors to 
work with their military commanders. 
  "There is an eerie calm now and occasional shooting," Kabia 
told AFP by telephone from Kigali. "We are working on modalities 
of implementing the ceasefire with both sides, and we are in 
constant contact with both sides." 
  Foreigners who arrived in Nairobi said they had seen bodies 
lying on the streets with their limbs and heads hacked off with 
machetes as they drove to the Kigali airport Sunday. 
  They said that even if the rebels and army observed the 
ceasefire, pro-government militias would still send death squads 
to butcher members of the minority Tutsi tribe which supports 
the rebels, and opposition supporters. 
  "They kill silently," said a foreigner who requested 
anonymity. "Even when you can't hear shells, they're still out 
there killing." 
  He estimated that militiamen from the majority Hutu tribe 
had 
killed "more than half" the 100,000 people slain since the April 
6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana unleashed a torrent of 
blood in the tiny central African country prone to ethnic 
massacres over three decades. 
  The foreigners said the rebels appeared to have sealed off 
Kigali on three sides and believed they were on the point of 
taking it. 
  The Red Cross meanwhile said it would evacuate some wounded 
people later this week from Kigali's main hospital to Kabgayi, 
about 45 kiLometres (27 miles) southwest of Kigali. 
  Patrick Gasser, deputy head of the International Committee 
of 
the Red Cross delegation in Kigali, denied reports of a mass 
evacuation to start Sunday. 
  "We are opening a new field hospital in a convent in 
Kabgayi, 
about three kilometres south of Gitarama town," Gasser said. 
  "The Kigali hospital is overcrowded and we cannot discharge 
any patients for security reasons," he said. 
  Thousands of Rwandans crammed into the hospital fear that if 
they leave they may become easy targets, diplomats said in 
Nairobi. 
  Gasser said government forces had guaranteed the security of 
patients to be transferred to Kabgayi, controlled by the interim 
government proclaimed after Habyarimana's death. 
  The rebels have also been informed of the plan. 
  "We don't expect the army or the RPF to attack our convoys," 
Gasser said. 
  Only patients well enough to travel by truck will be sent 
from Kigali to Kabgayi, but a surgical team will treat local 
casualties, Gasser said. 
  The first UN relief plane into Kigali since the world body 
suspended flights after one of its aircraft came under fire 
Thursday landed safely at the airport Sunday. 
  The UN resumed flights carrying desperately needed medicine 
and food after both sides pledged not to attack relief planes. 
  A visit by the new UN human rights commissioner Jose Ayala 
Lasso to Rwanda was delayed by "a day or so," Kabia said. 
  He had been scheduled to arrive in Kigali on Sunday in his 
first mission since taking office a week ago. 
  But Kabia said he would only reach the Kenyan capital 
Nairobi 
on Monday and would probably go to Kigali on Tuesday.

  [Excerpt] The cease-fires unilaterally declared by the two 
sides in the Rwandan conflict did not hold. It is true that the 
fighting was less fierce today than it was these past few days 
in Kigali, but it did continue. The United Nations took 
advantage of the lull to bring in a plane with food and 
medicines. But the respite looks like being a short one: one 
of the leaders of the Rwandan Patriotic Front has just announced 
that the airport will be the next target of his movement. He 
says the government forces are using it as a military base.

  [Text] Nairobi, 9 May (AFP) -- Sporadic gunfire continued 
in Rwanda's capital Kigali on Monday [9 May] despite two 
ceasefire offers, one by government forces and the other by 
rebels, a United Nations spokesman said. But the fighting has 
slackened off considerably from last week, when the 
corpse-littered city shook with the boom of mortar explosions as 
the belligerents shelled each other mercilessly. "It's been 
relatively quiet since Saturday," said spokesman Abdul Kabia 
contacted by telephone in Kigali. "We don't know whether the 
ceasefires are having any effect, but they have more or less 
stopped fighting for a while." 
  One ceasefire that was to have started at midnight Saturday 
was signed by Rwanda's interim government last week. The rebel 
Rwanda Patriotic Front then signed another, supposed to have 
taken effect at midnight Sunday. But Western diplomats and 
relief officials in the region expressed doubt that either would 
staunch Rwanda's month-old bloodbath in which some 100,000 
people have reportedly been killed. 
  Diplomats said reports indicated that pro-government 
militias 
only loosely under the control of the government were 
responsible for most of the slaughter, targeting members of the 
minority Tutsi tribe that forms the backbone of the rebel 
movement and Hutu opposition supporters. The militias would not 
feel bound by a ceasefire, and would continue clubbing and 
hacking their victims to death, the diplomats said.

  [Text] Since the beginning of May, Rwandans who had taken 
refuge in Tanzania have been returning to their country. 
Already 500 of them have been recorded arriving from Tanzania, 
and their number is increasing daily. Today at around 1100, 
more than 50 people crossed the border to return to the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front]-controlled zone. They indicated that 
others were on their way home. 
  All these returning refugees say they had fled the massacres 
in Rwanda. They said that living conditions in Tanzania were 
not good, due notably to a lack of food. This flow of Rwandan 
refugees returning home to the RPF-controlled zone from Tanzania 
might intensify over the next few days. Indeed, some of them 
are afraid that they might again face the Interahamwe 
[Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development 
militias], who are reportedly still occupying their houses, but 
they should know that, in the RPF-controlled zone, returnees are 
enjoying security. It would certainly be better for those who 
have already returned to their properties to reassure the others 
who are still afraid of the Interahamwe. 
  The RPF will also launch an appeal for them to return to 
their country and properties, an appeal which is valid as their 
security is guaranteed in the RPF-controlled prefecture.

  Meanwhile, the UNHCR has said it urgently needed $38.5 
million to provide humanitarian aid for 250,000 Rwandan refugees 
in Tanzania over the next three months. Aid workers have been 
battling torrential rains and sanitation problems to ease the 
plight of the refugees, who are crowded into makeshift camp near 
Ngara.

  [Excerpts] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] first vice 
chairman, Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka, in a press conference in 
Kibungo explains the nature of the Rwandan conflict. [passage 
omitted] 
  The journalists wanted to know what would happen if foreign 
military forces came anyway. Mr. Patrick Mazimpaka said that 
this would be violation of people in Rwanda and it would be 
called an invasion. 
  Asked as to why the RPF had rejected the UN special envoy in 
Rwanda, Mr. Jacques Roger Booh-Booh, the RPF vice chairman 
replied that the RPF had written to UN secretary general 
requesting for a replacement of Booh-Booh for he was found 
incapable of handling his present responsibilities. Mr. 
Mazimpaka gave examples of how Jacques Roger Booh-Booh had taken 
sides in the conflict. [passage omitted] Therefore, Mr. 
Mazimpaka said the RPF will have no dealings with the UN while 
Jacques Roger Booh-Booh is still in Rwanda.

  [Text] In Rwanda we will learn in the next few hours if the 
cease-fire is to hold. The transitional government announced an 
end to the fighting for 2200 GMT, 7 May and the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front is considering an end to the fighting for this 
evening. What is certain is that fighting continued in Kigali 
yesterday with heavy fighting taking place near the airport. 
The Rwandan Patriotic Front is still refusing to negotiate with 
the government, but it does not exclude talks with the Rwandan 
Armed Forces if they dissociate themselves from the government. 
A member of the RPF political bureau, Mr. Sendashonga, explains 
the reasons behind this attitude. He was interviewed from 
Byumba, in the north of the country, by Monique Mas: 
  [Sendashonga] If the Rwandan Armed Forces dissociate 
themselves from this government, then we are ready to sign a 
cease-fire agreement, an agreement to end the fighting, however 
this does not imply the recognition of the self-proclaimed 
government. 
  [Mas] What is your main objective? 
  [Sendashonga] Obviously, it would be to take Kigali. This is 
the eventual objective. 
  [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution? 
  [Sendashonga] We believe that there are now three issues. We 
must be allowed to achieve the rescue of the people who managed 
to survive the genocide, the killings. The civilian and 
military elements responsible for these killings and this 
genocide must be rendered harmless forever; I mean, mostly the 
people behind the killings. We must be left to restore law and 
order, peace and security throughout the country and this for 
each and everyone. 
  We know that there are sound elements in this army, but they 
are hostage to their environment and their commanders. If these 
commanders understand that this complicity with corrupt 
politicians is pointless we are ready to welcome them at any 
time.

  [Text] In Zaire, the political debate is deadlocked. In 
spite of two meetings this week, the High Council of the 
Republic-Transitional Parliament has not reached a consensus on 
the appointment of a prime minister. The radical opposition, 
which has distanced itself from the interim parliament, has not 
changed its position at all and asserts its support for Etienne 
Tshisekedi. This is what (Christian Badibangi), the vice 
minister of external relations in the Tshisekedi government, 
explains to our reporter Francois-Luc Moukouangui. 
  [Begin (Badibangi) recording] One has the impression that 
the 
Sovereign National Conference [SNC] has been forgotten. Our 
people have been forgotten. We are trying to demonstrate that 
the people are tired and that it is a matter for Mobutu and the 
Union for Democracy and Social Progress. 
  The Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition and Allies, 
composed of several political parties and civil organizations, 
asserts that Mr. Etienne Tshisekedi is the elected candidate of 
the SNC. The promulgated law, our Constitution, recognizes that 
this legal decision is not the responsibility of the opposition, 
a political family distinct from that of the head of state which 
cannot present a candidate for prime minister. [end recording]

  [Text] The Government of Ghana has reaffirmed its 
determination to continue to adhere strictly to international 
law and the principle of good-neighborliness in its relations 
with Togo, but it hopes the Togolese Government will also 
reciprocate this gesture so that the people of the two countries 
can live in peace and harmony. 
  In a statement issued in Accra today, the Ministry of 
Foreign 
Affairs said, true to form, that the Government of Togo has 
begun a campaign of baseless accusations against Ghana in the 
face of a crisis that is the product of Togo's current domestic 
situation. The statement said that on 1 May, the Togolese 
foreign minister summoned Ghana's charge d'affaires in Lome to 
the Foreign Ministry to inform him that his government was in 
possession of information that a named Togolese refugee resident 
in Ghana was using other Togolese nationals to carry grenades 
and other bombs into Togo from Ghana for use in crowded 
restaurants, bars, and nightclubs normally patronized by 
foreigners. 
  According to the Togolese foreign minister, the couriers 
succeeded in smuggling the items into Togo by constantly 
outwitting both Ghanaian and Togolese security officials at the 
border. He therefore appealed to the Government of Ghana to 
restrain the named Togolese refugee and also assist in putting 
an end to such activities. No specific evidence of the alleged 
activity of the individual was however furnished to the charge 
d'affaires. 
  Before the Ghana Government could investigate the allegation 
and [words indistinct] with its stand that he was not laying any 
blame on Ghana during their first meeting. The Togolese foreign 
minister again summoned the charge d'affaires to the ministry on 
4 May to lodge a verbal protest against Ghana about a bomb that 
had allegedly gone off in a restaurant in Lome the previous day, 
wounding five French nationals and a national of Benin. The 
minister claimed that the Ghana Government had done nothing as 
earlier requested to restrain the said Togolese refugee, 
forgetting that at his first meeting with the charge d'affaires, 
he conceded that bombs had already found their way into Togo in 
circumstances in which Ghana could not be blamed. The foreign 
minister also threatened the anger of France and other foreign 
governments against Ghana. 
  The statement said in view of the gravity of the accusation, 
and the irrational and incomprehensible tradition of the 
Togolese Government of vilifying Ghana whenever convenient to 
distract attention from the consensus of its policy, the 
minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Obed Asamoah, held separate 
meetings today with the charges d'affaires of Togo and France to 
reject the protest of the Togolese Government and to warn it 
against making Ghana the scapegoat for its folly.

  [Text] The two sides in the ethnic fighting within the 
United Liberation Movement, ULIMO, have agreed to a cease-fire, 
with immediate effect. The frontline commanders of the Krahns 
and Mandingos involved in the fighting are to begin withdrawing 
their troops from the main highway linking the Liberian capital, 
Monrovia, to Tubmanburg, ULIMO headquarters. 
  According to the agreement, ULIMO are to remove all of their 
checkpoints and turn over areas captured by them to the Nigerian 
contingent of the multi-African national peacekeeping force, 
ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group]. Hundreds of ULIMO fighters have been killed, 
along with civilians, in the Tubmanburg area since the outbreak 
of hostilities between the Krahns and Mandingos over two months 
ago. 
  The ULIMO ethnic fighting has resulted in the displacement 
of 
more than 7,000 civilians from Bomi County. A cease-fire 
agreement by ULIMO factions follows stern warning by the West 
African peacekeeping force to their leaders, Alhaji Koromah and 
Roosevelt Johnson, to stop the fighting or expect serious 
military measures. 
  Meanwhile, ECOMOG deputy field commander, Brigadier General 
John Addah, says the two ULIMO warlords are expected to meet in 
the Liberian capital, Monrovia, on Monday [9 May] to sort out 
the obstacles to peace in ULIMO. However, Koromah fighters have 
forwarded three conditions, rather the Krahn fighters have put 
forward three conditions, for ending the fighting. The Krahn 
commander, Roosevelt Johnson, says Alhaji Koromah will have to 
withdraw all those initially appointed to the Liberian National 
Transitional Government and set up a new committee to appoint 
other Liberians to occupy ULIMO positions on the government. He 
says this is the basis upon which he signed the agreement.

  [Text] The cease-fire in Liberia's ethnic conflict between 
two factions of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] has apparently failed to take hold. Frontline 
commanders of Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn soldiers and Alhaji 
Koromah's Mandingo forces signed a deal late on Friday [6 May] 
to cease hostilities and allow African peacekeepers to move into 
the battle area. But there seems to be some doubt about whether 
the signatories had the authority to agree to a cease-fire, and 
clashes have continued. Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report 
from Monrovia: 
  Troops of the African peacekeeping force deployed along the 
Tubmanburg highway confirmed today that four fighters have been 
badly wounded there in renewed fighting. They said two 
fighters, one from the Krahn and one from the Mandingo side, 
were badly wounded, one with fragments of grenade in his right 
thigh, another with his wrist chopped off. They confirmed that 
units of the African peacekeeping force were prevented on 
Saturday from going into the area by the fighting. 
  Frontline commanders of the opposing sides signed a 
cease-fire agreement on Friday and pledged to allow a free flow 
of traffic to all people residing in the area. They also 
pledged to give troops of the African force free passage in and 
out of western Liberia, which is controlled by ULIMO, which has 
for the past two months been beset by ethnic clashes. However, 
Thomas Ziah, a die-hard supporter of the Krahn faction leader 
Roosevelt Johnson, told me at his residence, with Johnson by his 
side, that Krahn frontline commanders who signed the agreement 
on Friday had done so without their authority. 
  It seems likely that the current round of fighting will 
further narrow prospects to any breakthrough in talks on Monday 
between the two ULIMO faction leaders, Roosevelt Johnson and 
Alhaji Koromah.

  [Text] As Nigeria's acute shortage of fuel continues in 
spite of dire warnings to oil companies and the National 
Petroleum Corporation to get their acts together, there've been 
more deaths connected with the crisis. Petrol filling stations 
have been running out of fuel, and there has been a spate of 
deaths. On the latest, Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos: 
  [Begin Odunfa recording] At least eight persons died in a 
petrol tanker fire in Lagos yesterday. Two others suffered 
severe injuries. The casualties were members of the National 
Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, NUPENG, who were in 
a motorcade of about 22 fuel tankers from Yaba on Lagos mainland 
to the Lagos State Secretariat, about 10 km away to protest to 
the military administrator alleged harassment of their 
colleagues by state officials. The lead vehicle of the 
motorcade ran out of control and into the (?path) of the vehicle 
behind it. The two crashed and burst into flames, trapping 
occupants of their driver compartments. When the fire subsided 
two hours later, eight bodies were pulled out of the debris. 
Two other victims are receiving treatment for severe burns. 
The deaths bring to at least 13 the number of people killed in 
petrol fires in the past two weeks of severe petrol shortage in 
Nigeria. The shortage itself is easing as a result of 
supplementary import and consulted efforts by all agencies of 
government to stamp out hoarding and diversion of supplies from 
authorized outlets. In Lagos, petrol is being rationed to 
motorists at 30 liters per purchase in a bid to meet the 
available stock demand. Soldiers and policemen are supervising 
distribution and sales. 
  Meanwhile, the Nigerian Labor Congress, NLC, has dissociated 
itself from the call by the human rights group, Campaign for 
Democracy, for its sit-at-home protest by workers and market 
women on Monday [9 May]. Reacting, NLC spokesman, Malam Salisu 
Muhammed, told journalists in Lagos that the planned protest was 
senseless. [end recording]

  [Text] The Federal Government intervention in the acute 
fuel shortage experienced all over the country in the last two 
to three weeks and the NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation] response to the challenge has brought some measure 
of relief to motorists living in Lagos metropolis. 
  Energy correspondent Antonia Amosu, who monitored the 
situation in Lagos today, reports that fuel is now available at 
virtually all filling stations. She, however, observes that in 
spite of this, the long queues at filling stations have not yet 
disappeared. The queues are only shorter. Deliveries of petrol 
to filling stations are proceeding uninterrupted. The traffic 
in Lagos is a confirmation of the improved petrol situation as 
the usual congestion is back and commuting from one end to 
another is taking longer hours compared to last week when the 
roads were free. 
  Petroleum and Mineral Resources Minister Chief Don Etiebet 
was taken up by journalists on the issue of petroleum smuggling 
after inaugurating a five-member administering committee of the 
Petroleum Technology Development Fund today: 
  [Begin Etiebet recording] [Words indistinct] and it has 
become, I must tell you, an occupation in the country. It has 
come an industry, institutionalized. So, it is going to take 
some time to disappear; and they are always looking to see 
whether you are relentless enough. We should continue with the 
fight. So, today they will stop and tomorrow they will start 
again. But I want to assure you, and members of the public, 
that government is going to be absolutely relentless in pursuing 
this course. [end recording]

  [Text] The minister of information and culture, Professor 
Jerry Gana, has urged Nigerians not to heed the stay at home 
call by a group of democracy campaigners over the present fuel 
scarcity. He told newsmen in Minna, Niger State, today that 
such a call was illegal and unpatriotic. 
  Prof. Gana stated that there would be chaos if people obeyed 
calls by any group to stay away from work, stressing that it was 
a sign of indiscipline. The minister also pointed out that if 
the call was adhered to it would worsen the fuel scarcity as 
those in that sector would stay at home. 
  Prof. Gana appealed to the group to give the government a 
chance to put things right.

  [Text] Negotiators of the Angolan peace talks today had a 
quiet day following the resolution of the issue regarding the 
second round of presidential elections. Mediator Alioune 
Blondin Beye is on his way to Johannesburg to attend the 
swearing-in of the new government. The Angolan peace talks will 
be suspended for some days. Our correspondent Alves Antonio 
Reports from Lusaka: 
  [Begin Antonio recording] Due to the UN special 
representative's absence, talks between the government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] will 
only resume possibly on 11 May. Meanwhile, political analysts 
in Lusaka believe that the government and UNITA negotiating 
teams have taken a significant step toward peace in the country. 
They say that now it is necessary for the government and UNITA 
to resolve the outstanding issues, namely those concerning seven 
specific principles of the point on national reconciliation, a 
task which is not easy and demands skill by the negotiators, 
since national reconciliation is important to everyone. For 
this reason it needs the contribution of all interested parties, 
including religious congregations. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, a diplomatic source has told our reporters in 
Lusaka that the Angolan Government will continue efforts to 
achieve the national reconciliation in order that there may be 
peace in the country as soon as possible.

  [Text] Luanda May 6 SAPA -- Angola announced on Friday [6 
May] it would extend immediate recognition to the new South 
African Government. The ANGOP national news agency reported the 
Angolan Government as saying the all-race elections in South 
Africa had opened a new era of harmony between the two countries. 
  The election had also opened an era of co-operation among 
the 
people and countries in southern Africa. This would contribute 
to the pacification, stabilisation and development of one of the 
world's most tense regions.

  [Text] The Angolan Armed Forces [FAA] and the men of the 
Black Cockerel are involved in fierce fighting in the country's 
central region. A FAA General Staff source says that the 
fighting is taking place in Chongoroi and Tchindjendje. 
  In the north, the National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola [UNITA] forces have been carrying out operations 
against the government forces in the area of (Dala Ucua), Bengo 
Province. That source also disclosed that, in the wake of the 
FAA forces' reoccupation of N'dalatando, Cuanza Norte Province, 
the situation is now improving in favor of the government forces. 
  Two Zairian Army officers were killed on the Eastern Front a 
few days ago. They were fighting alongside the UNITA forces. 
In addition to [words indistinct] military operations, one can 
now witness an intense [words indistinct] and concentration of 
UNITA forces north of Dundo, near the border with Zaire. 
  In Cuito, the UNITA forces continue to murder, beat up, and 
abduct local civilians, as well as to (?throw) explosives 
against positions occupied by government forces.

  [Text] N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province, 
is not under the effective control of the Popular Movement for 
the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] troops. Our 
correspondent Firmino Lukamba says that N'dalatando is currently 
the scene of the most violent clashes on the African continent, 
despite the presence of the United Nations in Angola passively 
observing the National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola's [UNITA] [words indistinct]. The clashes are taking 
place exactly in the lower part of that city, where foreign 
mercenaries have set innocent civilians alight, using the 
hideous necklace method. Right now the city is covered with 
smoke due to the explosion of the deadliest bombs which the 
Soviet Union and some Western countries supplied to the Luanda 
regime, a scenario which, according to our war reporter, is 
reminiscent of the battle for Leningrad during the World War II. 
Here is his report: 
  At present they are deployed in Ward No. 218's hospital and 
volunteer's streets. [sentence as heard] The manhunt in areas 
controlled by the MPLA has reached alarming proportions. People 
linked to other political forces, except the Angolan Democratic 
Party and [words indistinct], have been necklaced. The 
mercenaries have raped children and old people [words 
indistinct] it is horrifying what is happening in N'dalatando 
today. 
  At (?0630) on 7 May a group of about [words indistinct] 
(?mercenaries) backed by two T-57 tanks tried to break through 
our lines east of the city. After an hour of fierce clashes, 
the enemy left on the ground 18 confirmed killed and several 
wounded, whose blood is still running on the paved streets. Our 
forces captured 17 RPG-7 grenades, 22 ammunition belts for PKM 
machine gun, 78 AGS- 17 grenades, 1,300 AK-47 rounds of 
ammunitions, 18 knapsacks, 10 [word indistinct], and other 
military equipment. Our soldiers are still collecting the 
military equipment.

  [Text] Soldiers pulled the trigger in the city of Bie 
[Cuito] yesterday, but the situation is now calm. Violence 
broke out at 1300 when a Popular Movement for the Liberation of 
Angola-Labor Party air force plane parachuted supplies for the 
Luanda regime troops. Ironically the parachutes landed in the 
area of the city controlled by the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola. Government forces were promptly 
mobilized to retrieve the parachutes. The Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FALA] reacted against the provocation. 
The People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] 
persisted in their designs and the clashes began. The clashes 
were intense and there were dead and wounded, though it has not 
been possible to make a final assessment of yesterday's 
skirmishes. The situation was calm last night, but it is not 
known whether FAPLA will mount new attacks.

<F P=106> [Address by Speaker Dr. Frene Ginwala to the National </F>
Assembly, Parliament building, Cape Town -- live] 
  [Text] I deem it a great honor to be elected speaker of 
this, the first democratically elected Parliament of South 
Africa. At the same time, I am conscious that it is a grave 
responsibility. I thank the honorable members for the 
confidence they have placed in me by appointing me to this high 
office. I shall do my utmost to vindicate their trust by 
carrying out my duties in a spirit of fairness, justice and 
impartiality towards each and every member of this house. 
  At the same time, I appeal to members for their cooperation 
at all times in upholding the dignity of this institution. 
Without that cooperation, my task will be difficult, indeed. 
The right of free speech, which is the essence of parliamentary 
debate, implies, inter alia, the right to make statements with 
which other members may strongly disagree, provided such 
statements comply with the Rules of Order. It will be my duty 
to protect that right, and to ensure that every voice is able to 
make itself heard here. The spirit of tolerance and good humor, 
despite differences of opinion, is conducive to good debate. 
  We are living in a time of great change in this country, 
which is reflected in this institution. This parliament differs 
from its predecessors in its composition, more representative in 
terms of the significantly larger number of women, and of 
persons of all races, creeds, economic status, and political 
persuasion. This parliament will now operate within the 
framework of a constitution that is the supreme law of this 
land. Nonetheless, the policy of this assembly must become the 
voice of the people of South Africa, articulated through their 
elected representatives. This house is both the fulfilment and 
the repository of the values and principles that at great cost 
have driven the changes through which our country and its people 
are passing. 
  All eyes will be on this parliament, as it meets to address 
the needs and expectations of all South Africans. May our 
proceedings here, whatever our political differences, be marked 
by a spirit of mutual respect for one another, and for the 
institution of a constitutional democracy. I now call upon 
Sheik (Shabir) to say a prayer. The honorable members please 
rise.

flight. He said he was deeply moved to be in South Africa, where 
he said democracy was now a reality. 
  [Butrus-Ghali] I pay tribute to the people of South Africa 
for this great achievement. I rejoice with you; you have shown 
that democratic values can overcome differences and 
discrimination. The new South Africa is a land of promise and 
of hope. As you take your rightful place in Africa, in the 
United Nations and in the world, we welcome you, we wish you 
well. 
  [Roux] Next to arrive was Danish Prime Minister Nyrup 
Rasmussen. He also offered his congratulations and said Denmark 
and South Africa could look forward to better relations in the 
future. 
  [Rasmussen] I can assure you that my country Denmark will be 
here also to assist you in all what we can -- our experiences 
and our systems. We will be there. We hope the best for the 
future of South Africa. 
  [Roux] Among the other arrivals today were heads of state

  [Text] [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nan Roux] Well, 
good morning from a lovely day here at Jan Smuts Airport. One 
couldn't have asked for a more perfect day to welcome the 
international guests to sunny South Africa. Several dignitaries 
have arrived already but the man everybody was waiting for has 
finally arrived, the leader of the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat. Mr. Yasir 'Arafat caught us 
from behind -- he sneaked up from behind. Cameras were ready 
and we caught him for his first address on South African soil. 
  ['Arafat] Good morning. I am very happy to have...to be here 
this morning on this historical...[pause] events -- historical 
day, and I am very happy also that I will be able to convey to 
His Excellency, my brother, my friend, President Mandela, all 
the greetings and good wishes from our people, from the 
Palestinian people, from all his old friends and the PLO, and I 
also would like to convey to his deputy, Mr. de Klerk, best 
wishes and best regards. 
  [Roux] Mr. 'Arafat apparently organized eight of his own 
cars 
and own drivers to transport his delegation. Mr. 'Arafat is 
definitely a highlight of the arrivals today, but several other 
very interesting and very exciting dignitaries arrived, among 
them Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Mr. 
Douglas Hurd of the United Kingdom, and the former president of 
Tanzania, Mr. Julius Nyerere. We caught up with them earlier 
this morning. 
  [Bhutto] Hello international press. How are you. I'm 
supposed to say hello to you, I'm told. OK, alright. It's a 
wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the whole 
world, and I'm here on behalf of Pakistan to show that we all 
join in this moment of victory, victory for mankind. 
  [Hurd] What can I say. It's a huge...a huge event, a huge 
pleasure to be here, and to congratulate on everything that has 
been achieved and to just give our support, promise our support 
for what has to be achieved in the future. 
  [Unidentified speaker] The former president of Tanzania. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Can we have a statement? 
  [Nyerere] Well, what statement. I'm glad to be here. I 
certainly wanted to come to a free South Africa. I never 
believed it was going to come in my lifetime, but here it is. 
Thank you. 
  [Roux] Well it's definitely a very exciting day here at Jan 
Smuts Airport. We are now awaiting the arrival of Mr. Fidel 
Castro, from Cuba. As soon as we have him we'll bring that to 
you, otherwise the next arrival is the first lady of America, 
Mrs. Hillary Clinton, together with Vice President Al Gore. And 
with that, back to the studio. [end recording]

  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The founding president of 
Tanzania, Mr Julius Nyerere, arrived at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts 
Airport on Monday [9 May] to celebrate the launch of a new, free 
South Africa. Speaking on his arrival, a smiling Mr Nyerere, 
once a crusader against colonialism and a long-time enemy of 
Pretoria, told media: "I always wanted to come to a free South 
Africa. I never believed it would come. But here it is." 
  Mr Nyerere, along with hundreds of other delegations from 
all 
over the world, will attend the presidential inauguration of Mr 
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on Tuesday, following South Africa's 
first all-race elections. 
  Delegations from Slovakia, Georgia, Syria and Bangladesh 
have 
also just arrived. Asked if Bangladesh would be investing in 
South Africa, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman said his 
country had no money to invest. "But we will share our 
knowledge," he said. 
  Delegations from Iran and Rumania have also arrived, but did 
not speak at any length to the press. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro is reportedly due to arrive at 
any moment.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- British Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd says there has been a huge upsurge in British 
business interest in South Africa. Speaking on his arrival at 
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport on Monday [9 May] morning, Mr 
Hurd said he was in the country to show Britain's support for a 
new South Africa, which will be launched symbolically on Tuesday 
with the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. He told 
reporters he would visit British-aided projects in the East Rand 
townships on Monday. Future British Government support would 
continue to focus on South Africa's needs, he said. 
  Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who also arrived 
for 
Mr Mandela's inauguration, said South Africa had shown it was 
possible to satisfy diverse interests in a positive way. "We 
are a country that has emerged from war. The message (from 
South Africa) is political solutions have to be sought by 
peaceful means," he said. 
  Former British Prime Minister Lord James Callaghan said 
South 
Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he 
had a message for South Africa, Lord Callaghan said "South 
Africa is going to work out its own destiny". 
  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was one of the most 
outspoken of the VIPs who streamed in to the airport at a steady 
rate on Monday. Of the inauguration she said: "This is a 
wonderful moment, not just for South Africa but for the world." 
  Ninety-one delegations from around the world were due to 
arrive on Monday. Representatives from Italy, Portugal, Malta, 
Spain and Finland had arrived already and included Spain's heir 
to the throne, Portuguese President Mario Soares and Finland's 
President Martii Ahtisaari. Delegations from the Bahamas, 
Trinidad and Tobago had also arrived.

  [Excerpt] It was announced at midnight that Cuban President 
Fidel Castro will attend the inauguration of President Mandela 
tomorrow. Keith Kendall asked Marques Rodriques, councillor at 
the Cuban Foreign Ministry and presently in Pretoria, why the 
announcement was so late. 
  [Begin recording] [Rodriques] Well, I mean that depends on 
the schedule of President Castro. You know that Cuba is a very 
far country and the president of course has a lot of engagements 
to attend, and that's why it's a normal procedure. 
  [Kendall] This was not for security reasons? 
  [Rodriques] Well, it's part of the procedures for the 
president. (?They) take into consideration the distance between 
Cuba and South Africa, and the engagements of the president. 
  [Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South 
Africa? 
  [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There 
have been long historical relations between Cuba and the 
patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this 
victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great 
importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy 
towards President Mandela and his post. 
  [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa 
following the inauguration of President Mandela? 
  [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our 
government to keep very close ties with the new Government of 
South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field, 
and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from 
the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view, 
and many other fields. We feel very optimistic that this kind 
of relations will become greater. [passage omitted] [end

  [Text] Cape Town May 9 SAPA -- Mr Derek Keys will remain 
South Africa's minister of finance, National Party [NP] leader 
Mr F. W. de Klerk confirmed in a statement on Monday [9 May]. 
Releasing the six members of his party to take cabinet posts, 
he confirmed the widely expected reappointment of the former 
minister of finance. 
  The former minister of foreign affairs, Mr Pik Botha, would 
serve as the minister of mineral and energy affairs in terms of 
an agreement reached with President-Elect Mr Nelson Mandela. 
The NP cabinet component in the government of national unity 
also included three deputy ministers. 
  Dr Dawie de Villiers had been appointed minister of the 
environment; Mr Kraai van Niekerk, minister of agriculture; Mr 
Roelf Meyer, minister of provincial affairs and of 
constitutional development; and Mr Abe Williams, minister of 
welfare and population development. The deputy ministers are Mr 
Tobie Meyer, Mr Renier Schoeman and Mr Chris Fismer. A final 
agreement regard their portfolios would be reached soon. 
  Dr van Niekerk, who is not currently a member of parliament, 
would be named as a senator. The NP would nominate former 
Justice Minister Mr Kobie Coetsee for the office of president of 
the senate.

<F P=106> [Report by Karin Brynard] </F>
  [Text] Mr. de Klerk's National Party [NP] is fuming at the 
manner in which the ANC announced its members for the new 
cabinet on Friday [6 May] afternoon. 
  The new cabinet is also going to be the government of 
national unity. But the names of the ANC members and their 
portfolios was issued by the organization's department of 
information while ANC leader Mr. Nelson Mandela and De Klerk 
were locked in discussions on how the new cabinet should look. 
One senior NP spokesman now says that this unilateral gesture 
leaves a bitter taste in the mouth, and besides, Mr. Mandela has 
broken his word. He said that Mr. Mandela had indicated in an 
earlier discussion with Mr. de Klerk that one of the posts -- 
namely, that of minister of police services, would, for the sake 
of continuity, order and stability, be given to the NP. Now the 
ANC's Mr. Sydney Mufamadi has been given the post. 
<H5>  Dignified Way </H5>
  The Nationalists said they were under the impression that 
Mr. 
Mandela, after his discussions regarding cabinet portfolios with 
Mr. de Klerk, as well as with Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the 
Inkatha Freedom Party, would announce in a dignified fashion how 
the government of national unity would look. 
  They believe that perhaps there was a breakdown in 
communications between the ANC leader and the organization's 
information department. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Mandela has said that the portfolios could 
always be reshuffled and that consultations between him and Mr. 
de Klerk were still in progress. 
  As to who the NP members of the new cabinet are, speculation 
in this regard is still rife. 
  It is virtually certain that Mr. Derek Keys will remain as 
minister of finance, this after the ANC had been considering -- 
until last week -- to appoint the first new deputy president, 
Mr. Thabo Mbeki, in this position. The Nationalists were 
annoyed, however, when the ANC indicated that Mr. Keys should 
stay on. They say it makes it appear as though he is an ANC man 
and not the NP's choice. 
  The NP can appoint six members in the cabinet. Alongside Mr. 
Keys are the names of current Constitutional Development 
Minister Roelf Meyer, who could be retained in the post; Dr. 
Dawie de Villiers; Mr. Kobie Coetsee; Mr. Leon Wessels, and Mr. 
Abe Williams. 
  The NP will be able to appoint three deputy ministers and 
among the names mentioned are Chris Fismer and Tobie Meyer. 
<H5>  Pik's Future </H5>
  Regarding Mr. Pik Botha's future, there has also been a lot 
of speculation. He said he was not intending to step out of 
politics even if he is not included in the new cabinet. RAPPORT 
was told that it is unlikely that he will be appointed minister. 
He also does not seem interested in a foreign post or a senior 
post such as chairman of the senate. It has been speculated for 
a while now that perhaps he intends spending just two more years 
in politics. 
  It is expected that the full cabinet will be announced today 
or tomorrow. 
<H5>  Senate Posts </H5>
  Meanwhile, there is a big scramble for senators' posts in NP 
ranks. The senate will have 90 seats -- 10 from each province. 
These are allocated proportionately according to the support of 
the parties, and a party must get at least 10 percent support in 
a province before it can appoint a senator. 
  For the NP it means that it can appoint five in the Western 
Cape, four in the Northern Cape, one in KwaZulu/Natal, one in 
the Orange Free State and probably three on the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]. 
  The stiffest competition is on the PWV where there are 29 
suitable candidates. The biggest competition there is possibly 
between Dr. Rina Venter, the outgoing minister of national 
health; the former minister of trade and industry, Dr. Org 
Marais; and party officials such as Transvaal Secretary Dr. 
Gerhard Koornhof and Mr. Kobus du Plessis.

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program by announcer Akwe Amosu] </F>
  [Text] Following Nelson Mandela's naming yesterday of his 
choice of ministers for his new cabinet, there is some horse 
trading to be done with the National Party and Inkatha, but Mr. 
Mandela is expected to get most of what he wants. 
  The most surprising omission from the list was ANC [African 
National Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa who, 
failing to win the position of deputy president under Mandela, 
apparently chose to have no post at all, but perhaps the 
toughest job went to veteran ANC leader Joe Slovo. He is 
nominated for the housing and welfare portfolio and, therefore, 
the man who will be expected to deliver on all the ANC's 
election promises. On the line to Johannesburg, I asked him if 
he was not troubled by the enormity of the task ahead. 
  [Begin recording] [Slovo] Well, it is certainly a worry I 
have that we might fail. You can never be absolutely certain of 
success, but it will not be for want of trying. You know, I 
would say that for me the 50 years of struggle was the easy 
part. Now, comes the very difficult, hard part, so we must have 
no illusions, but at the same time it has its own excitement, 
without dramatics, without heroics. You just have got to put 
roofs over people's heads. 
  [Amosu] Some cynics have said that you have been given the 
hottest potato in the cabinet and while you have got enormously 
high personal stock with the ANC supporters at the moment, if 
you fail you will be the one to carry the can. The fact that 
you are the most prominent white member of the ANC will make it 
easy to explain it away, if you fail. 
  [Slovo] Not really. In the first place, I have never been a 
populist. I have never undertaken any aspect of work or policy 
in order to sound popular, to get applause, and so on. I am 
grateful for the fact that I am valued by quite a lot of people 
and I do not believe I have been put into this position just 
because of that. I think somebody has to do it and I am honored 
that I have been asked to do it because it is one of the key 
portfolios. I am very well aware of the risks involved in 
trying to (?eat) this what you call the hot potato, but it is 
going to taste all the better for it at the end if I succeed in 
actually swallowing it. 
  [Amosu] There are some people who have been saying that they 
are surprised about the line-up of the cabinet as a whole and 
that it seems to include a great many of what you might call the 
old guard and that younger, more militant members of the ANC -- 
the most obvious person who comes to mind is Cyril Ramaphosa -- 
simply are not represented in the kinds of numbers that people 
expected. What is your response to that? 
  [Slovo] Well, look, each person in the ANC will have his or 
her own reaction to the bunch as a whole, but I think on the 
whole it must be regarded as a first shot. I am sure that, 
within a short time, when things come out in the (?wash), there 
will have to be a reshuffle of sorts. The group that President 
Mandela has appointed I think, for a start, should be able to 
manage the job. 
  [Amosu] There has been a lot of surprise, though, about the 
exclusion -- apparently by his own choice -- of Mr. Ramaphosa. 
Should there be surprise? Were you not yourself expecting him 
to get opposed? 
  [Slovo] It was an exclusion by Ramaphosa's own choice. I 
think Ramaphosa could have got any post in that cabinet that he 
would have opted for. I think he decided...[pauses] Imean, he 
did, I think, contest the deputy presidency but when that 
decision was taken, I think he decided that he would best serve 
the organization and the cause by staying as general secretary 
and concentrating on maintaining and building the ANC as a 
political organization. 
  [Amosu] What will your first real hands-on practical 
measures 
be toward fulfilling your brief as the housing and welfare 
minister? 
  [Slovo] Well, I think in the first place I will have to meet 
the people there. I will have to tell what I feel, which is 
they are in the most important ministry -- well, every minister 
is going to say this -- and that, really, if they and I succeed 
in only half our task in the coming year or two, we will have 
done more than has been done by 300 years of white regimes that 
preceded us but, of course, without money, without resources, 
motivation and inspiration is not enough. 
  [Amosu] Are you confident that when you finally start 
getting 
into your battles with Mr. Keys and the Treasury to get the 
money to do this job, that it will be forthcoming? 
  [Slovo] A whole future, and our past, is premised on being 
able to deliver up on our reconstruction and development 
program, and I think all ministries, including the Finance 
Ministry, will have to fit in with that objective. [end

  [Excerpts] President Nelson Mandela will from Tuesday be 
eligible to draw a basic, taxable annual salary of R575,000 
[rand], a special government committee on politicians salaries 
has decided. 
  With a car allowance of R115,000 added, as well as a free 
house worth, for tax purposes, R94,350 a year, his remuneration 
package adds up to R784,350. 
  This works out at R65,362.50 a month, although his takehome 
pay will amount to R34,136 after tax and other deductions. 
  Mandela agreed to the salary package this week in 
consultation with the outgoing Cabinet, said committee chairman 
Mr Justice D Melamet. 
  He will be the first president of South Africa to be taxed 
on 
his salary, the judge said in Pretoria yesterday. [passage 
omitted] 
  Net annual salaries (after deductions including tax) for 
deputy presidents amount to R338,247, while premiers and Cabinet 
Ministers will get R298,043, deputy Ministers R240,876, National 
Assembly members R137,001 and legislature members R132,121. A 
perk would be two free air tickets a month. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The president of the Reserve Bank says South Africa 
cannot expect long-term investments, such as the construction of 
industries by foreign companies, to flood into the country. Dr. 
Chris Stals said in Cape Town that South Africa must keep 
inflation as low as possible, especially to protect more 
disadvantaged people. He commented that political and economic 
stability is necessary to persuade foreign investors that their 
investments are secure. 
  [Begin Stals recording] Yes, I think that for the 
construction of a factory, for example, one that has to produce 
locally for a long time, one would need much more security 
concerning the economic policy and political stability, and I 
think that that sort of investment will only come later, once we 
have confirmed our own credibility and credit worthiness. [end

<F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Judge Johann Kriegler and </F>
IEC Commissioners Advocate Dikgang Moseneke and Professor Jorgen 
Elklit at Gallagher Estate, Midrand -- live] 
  [Text] [Kriegler] We have reached a milestone in the 
history of our country. Barely four years ago, after decades of 
strife and dissent, we struck a bold course for the future. 
Just over four months ago the Independent Electoral Commission 
[IEC] was created. Its task was well nigh superhuman: to 
organize, administer, supervise, and conduct our country's 
first, wholly democratic elections. Many said it would be 
impossible, and it very nearly was. We had the will but not the 
time. 
  The election we offered to the people of our country was 
admittedly flawed in many ways, but that is peripheral. Some 20 
million people of this land were granted the opportunity of a 
say in our future government. They have spoken and 
notwithstanding manifold difficulties the commission is proud to 
be able to announce the results. More significantly, we have 
concluded that we can certify each of the 10 elections 
concerned, to have been substantially free and fair. This we 
are able to do despite the large number of objections and 
complaints from various political parties. The campaign period 
was relatively peaceful. Complaints arising in this regard were 
investigated, mediated, or prosecuted. Viewed in the context of 
historical animosities, political, social, and ethnic, 
campaigning was relatively free. Through the electoral fund 
parties were enabled to conduct effective electioneering. Our 
program to provide access to so-called no-go areas stretched 
across the land from the Letsitele valley to the far reaches of 
the Richtersveld. At the same time voter education was 
coordinated and directed towards those sectors of our community 
which needed it most. The low percentage of spoilt papers bears 
testimony to the success of these efforts. A vigorous 
communications program served to focus attention on the 
elections to establish the secrecy of the vote and in this way 
to counteract intimidation. Indeed on the voting days 
intimidation was not a major feature. 
  The task of furnishing reasonably accessible, yet secure 
voting stations, proved intractable, and many compromises had to 
be made. Political developments and a number of formal 
self-governing or independent territories, compounded the task. 
Less than a week before voting was due to commence 500 voting 
stations had to be identified, staffed, equipped, and secured in 
KwaZulu. 
  In order to promote inclusivity, a crash program for the 
issuing of temporary voter cards had to be launched and 80 
million stickers had to be printed and distributed to serve 
9,000 localities. Some 200,000 officials designedly drawn from 
the community at large, had to be trained and retrained. The 
voters joyfully turned out in their millions on 27 April -- our 
administration proved unequal to the task, but we managed to 
pull back from disaster by the efforts of many, both inside and 
outside the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission]. The 
electorate was still offered a reasonable opportunity to vote. 
When it came to counting the strain again proved too much. 
  Once again disaster was narrowly averted and emergency 
measures to identify and verify approximately 40 million ballot 
papers, were introduced. Alleged electoral violations occurring 
during the voting and counting periods of the elections will be 
investigated and where appropriate, prosecuted. We acknowledge 
that the measures we took displeased many. The heart of the 
matter is that we were able to establish the expressed will of 
the people with reasonable accuracy. We are satisfied that the 
results we are about to announce were established in 
substantially free and fair elections. 
  In three respects the commission used the powers vested in 
it 
by Section 47 of the Electoral Act. One, at the counting 
station in Lady Frere, Eastern Cape, there was adequate evidence 
that approximately 30 ballot boxes had been forcibly opened. In 
consequence the commission decided to cause 50,000 votes in the 
provincial election, and 50,000 in the national, to be deducted 
from all the competing parties, proportionally; two, the 
unavailability of stickers at many voting stations, during a 
part of the voting days, technically rendered votes cast during 
such periods, invalid. Special instructions were given to avoid 
such eventuality, which would have disenfranchised voters to the 
prejudice of their parties of choice. 
  The commission is satisfied that substantial justice would 
be 
done if the votes cast in favor of parties on such invalid 
papers, were by way of adjustment, equated to the number 
thereof; three, certain counting station data relating to 
KwaZulu-Natal could not be verified with the requisite degree 
and reliability. The commission is satisfied that it would be a 
fair and reasonably reliable test of the votes of that province, 
to adjust the verifiable information proportionally to the 
proven support of the respective parties in that province. 
  We intend announcing the results in the following order: 
First, I will read out the national results, mainly total votes 
and percentages, thereafter, I will ask my colleague, Professor 
Jorgen Elklit, to deal with the seat allocations in respect of 
the national election, and I will then ask my colleague, Dikgang 
Moseneke, to read all of the provincial results, also in 
numerical tallies, and in percentages. 
  The national results are as follows: 
  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]: 2,158,294 votes, 10.54 percent 
  PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress]: 243,478 votes, 1.25 percent) 
  Soccer Party: 10,575 votes, 0.05 percent; 
  Keep It Straight, Simple Party: 5,916 votes, 0.03 percent;

  Women's Rights Peace Party [WRPP]: 6,434 votes, 0.03 
percent;

0.10 percent

  LUSAP [Luso-South Africa Party]: 3,293 votes, 0.02 percent; 
  MF [Minority Front]: 13,433 votes, 0.07 percent 
  NP [National Party]: 3,983,690 votes, 20.39 percent; 
  Total: 19,533,497 
  Spoiled papers: 193,081 
  Percentage: 0.99 percent 
  [Elklit] I will not take you through the allocation rules 
of the new South African electoral system, but I want to stress 
that in my opinion it is a very fair proportional representation 
system which has been applied in this election. I will indicate 
to you the number of seats allocated to the various parties on 
the basis of the vote figures which Judge Kriegler has just read 
to you. 
  Pan-Africanist Congress: 5 seats; 
  Vryheidsfront/Freedom Front: 9 seats; 
  African Christian Democratic Party: 2 seats; 
  African National Congress: 252 seats; 
  Democratic Party: 7 seats;

five of them -- the ANC, the DP, NP, PAC, and FF -- all have 
candidates who have been elected to more than one house, and 
they have therefore to decide as soon as possible to which house 
they will send the persons in question. The IEC will 
communicate as soon as possible to the parties in question. 
  [Kriegler] That concludes the formal proceedings. The data 
conveyed to you here will be available in writing from the IEC

  [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi says he accepts the results of South Africa's all-race 
elections. He spoke to the media at a news conference in Ulundi 
today. 
  [Begin Buthelezi recording] I would like to express my deep 
gratitude and appreciation to the people of South Africa in 
their entirety. It was their commitment, after all, to 
democracy, evidenced in the way they ran to the polls to try and 
(?overcome) the adverse circumstances, which makes it possible 
for me to state that I accept this election in the interest of 
reconciliation, as sufficiently fair and free, to enable us to 
move forward, at least. I say so within the acknowledgment of 
the fact that of all the imperfections that the first election 
held, you know, we have had problems in the last few days -- 
each and every one of you as fellow South Africans, in your 
thousands and millions, have flocked to ballot stations to place 
your mark for the new South Africa. In sunshine and in rain and 
despite the countless frustrations you experienced you 
maintained your resolve and determination, and for this I thank 
you my fellow South Africans. [end recording]

Buthelezi has pledged his commitment to what he terms the 
development of healthy national and regional government. 
Speaking at Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi said there needed to be a 
constructive relationship between provincial and central

  His remarks are seen by observers as dispelling fears that 
he 
would not take part in the government of national unity, in 
which it is now speculated that he may occupy one of three IFP 
cabinet posts. 
  Dr. Buthelezi said he accepted the elections to have been

and Mr. F. W. de Klerk for their efforts to establish democracy 
in South Africa.

  [Text] Durban May 6 SAPA -- The defeated African National 
Congress in KwaZulu/Natal on Friday [8 May] greeted the news 
that it had lost the province to its arch-rival Inkatha Freedom 
Party [IFP] with distaste. 
  ANC Southern Natal spokesman Dumisani Makhaye claimed the 
elections in the province had been fraudulent and the results 
would rest on the consciences of Independent Electoral 
Commission leaders. "All the evidence is of massive rigging in 
terms of millions...Even the IFP knows it didn't win Natal," he 
said, adding that "the overwhelming majority of people in Natal 
will not accept the results". 
  Mr Makhaye said it was now up to the ANC leadership to 
consult its followers for a mandate on a course of action and 
strategy to deal with the defeat. Mr Makhaye's sentiments were 
echoed by Northern Natal ANC Chairman Bheki Ntuli who said "it's 
distressing that they've won after such great intimidation of 
our members". Mr Ntuli said the ANC was "a mature political 
organisation" and its reaction to the IFP's success was not 
"sour grapes". 
  The IFP won KwaZulu/Natal with 50.3 per cent of the votes 
compared to the ANC's 32.2 per cent. A total of 3.7 million 
people voted in the province.

  [Text] Durban May 6 SAPA -- The defeated African National 
Congress premier candidate for KwaZulu/Natal on Friday [6 May] 
said while he considered elections in his province fraudulent, 
the "judge's decision is final". Interviewed at Durban's Louis 
Botha Airport on Friday night, Jacob Zuma said without 
irregularities in the election process his party would have won 
in KwaZulu/Natal. 
  While ANC supporters would find it difficult to accept the 
result, he thought they would in the interests of peace. 
  Mr Zuma told journalists it was time to open a new chapter 
in 
the province where people could join hands to bring about peace 
and stability. 
  He indicated he accepted Independent Electoral Commission 
Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler's announcement that the 
election in all nine provinces had been free and fair.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 6 SAPA -- Police have uncovered an 
alleged rightwing plot to assassinate African National Congress 
PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier-Designate 
Tokyo Sexwale. 
  Spokesman Lt-Col Eugene Opperman confirmed on Friday [6 May] 
police had been informed of a plan to assassinate Mr Sexwale, 
but he would not divulge further details. Col Opperman said 
police had informed the ANC of the situation and "certain steps 
have been taken". 
  The plot apparently involved murdering Mr Sexwale on Friday 
night or on Saturday. The PWV Provincial Legislature will sit 
for the first time on Saturday to elect the region's premier. 
Mr Sexwale is widely tipped to fill the post. 
  ANC sources close to Mr Sexwale said the preier-designate 
was 
taking the threat "very seriously" and that the necessary 
security measures had been taken. ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa 
told SAPA the ANC was working closely with police to ensure the 
safety of Mr Sexwale.

  [Text] ABSA [Amalgamated Banks of South Africa] Bank has 
disclosed that it has dismissed its senior security official and 
former Vlakplaas police base operative, Mr. Andries van Heerden. 
Mr. van Heerden has been implicated in third force activities 
and the supply of arms to KwaZulu. Mr. van Heerden was named by 
Goldstone Commission's informant Q as the alleged middle man in 
arms deliveries to the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]. ABSA chief 
executive, Danie Cronje, said Mr. van Heerden had been dismissed 
two weeks ago following the completion of an internal 
investigation. 
  Regarding ABSA security head Dougie Crewe, who Q claimed had 
assisted Mr. van Heerden, Dr. Cronje said no evidence was found 
implicating him in third force activities. Dr. Cronje said 
although the internal investigation was completed some time ago, 
the bank had been advised by the Goldstone Commission and the 
Transvaal attorney general, Dr. Jan d'Oliveira, not to release 
any information earlier. However, following the arrest of the 
former Vlakplaas chief, Lieutenant Colonel Eugene de Kock, in 
connection with the Goldstone allegations, Dr. d'Oliveira gave 
ABSA permission to make the findings public. 
  Dr. Cronje said the suspension of maintenance employees, 
Victor and James Ndlovu, would remain in force on the advice of 
the attorney general. They have been implicated in train 
violence and investigations are continuing.

<F P=106> [Report by Frank Smyth] </F>
  [Text] "The humanitarian situation in Rwanda is grave: 
innocent women and children continue to be killed, thousands of 
wounded are without medical treatment, the country's 
infrastructures continue to be destroyed, a horrific war is 
raging in the hills, in the streets and in innocent people's 
homes," reads a statement signed by prominent African leaders 
including President-elect Nelson Mandela. 
  They sent it to the Organisation of African Unity, the 
United 
Nations Security Council and its secretary general, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  But in acknowledging the crimes being predominantly 
committed 
by Rwandan government soldiers and ruling party militiamen, 
Mandela fails to acknowledge South Africa's role in arming them. 
At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and some militiamen carry 
South African R4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992, 
along with 10,000 hand-grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000 
launching grenades, and more than one million rounds of 
ammunition. 
  Rwanda's purchase of arms from South Africa was in violation 
of a 1984 voluntary UN Security Council resolution. By 1977 it 
had already imposed a binding resolution against any arms sales 
to South Africa. 
  But the UN is expected to lift its arms embargo against 
South 
Africa soon. This would give Mandela the chance to demonstrate 
that the new South Africa would not sell arms to countries like 
Rwanda. Instead, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] 
executive Andre Buys told Defense News: "We expect that by 
1996 exports will at least 
  When Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in 
1989, 
he promised to end armed exports. But last year, after the 
country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed 
exports. Unfortunately, Mandela and the African National 
Congress seem likely to take the same road. 
  "Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome 
a 
complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes 
against South Africa," ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu told DEFENSE 
NEWS. "We also wish to state the new government will be in full 
compliance with international standards governing exports of 
technologies and materials that would threaten world security." 
  Such standards would preclude arms sales, for example, to 
states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a UN 
embargo. But states like Rwanda before its present crisis would 
still be able legally to buy arms. 
  No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to 
become one of the new South Africa's best earners of foreign 
exchange. But few would expect, either, a man who has devoted 
his life to his country's struggle for justice, equality and 
human rights to turn his back on future victims of other abusive 
regimes now. 
  He wouldn't necessarily need to. Because of the existing US 
embargo, precise figures on South Africa's military exports are 
unknown. But Denel, the state-owned manufacturing consortium 
created out of part of Armscor and its subsidiaries in 1992, has 
assets of $2.9-billion and has made about $175-million in arms 
exports annually so far. Denel accounts for only about 60 
percent of the country's total defence sales. 
  However lethal to its own citizens, Rwanda's purchase of 
$5.9- million worth of grenades, mortars and ammunition from 
Armscor made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance 
sheet. A leader in almost every weapons grouping, it expects to 
make most of its profit from the sale of expensive, hi-tech 
systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic 
warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and 
battlefield mobility systems. 
  South Africa also has a technological edge in landmine 
detection and sweeping equipment that countries like Cambodia, 
especially, need. While South Africa has already begun to 
market this equipment, it announced in March that it would not 
sell landmines at the same time, and stopped exports. 
  Although motivated by appearance before principle, this is a 
welcome sign. 
  But the ANC's present policy isn't good enough. While 
exporting mine-sweeping equipment and hi-tech weapons to earn 
foreign exchange rightfully, the new South Africa should 
re-examine its small-arms export policy. International 
prohibitions against arms sales to abusive regimes are at 
present non-existent or low. 
  Rwanda, long documented for its grisly record, is a case in 
point. Rather than sink to this standard, Mandela should lead 
the world in raising it up.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 8 SAPA -- Four hundred and 
eighty-seven people died and 132 were detained in South Africa 
during April, the Human Rights Commission [HRC] said in a report 
on Sunday [8 May]. "Two of the deaths were in police custody in 
the month that Section 29 of detention without trial was finally 
abolished," the HRC said. Most of the detentions were in Natal 
under the state of emergency. In 649 incidents of political 
violence countrywide during April, 338 people died in Natal, 137 
in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] and 12

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Human Rights Commission on 9 May; </F>
place not given] 
  [Text] As South Africa's first democratically elected 
Parliament sits for the first time today, a new era in South 
Africa's history is ushered in. The interim constitution has 
both a bill of rights and makes provision for a statutory human 
rights commission. In this light, HRC [Human Rights Commission] 
is changing its name to Human Rights Committee of South Africa 
so as to avoid any confusion. The Human Rights Committee will 
continue the work done by the commission but will also examine 
how human rights issues can best be monitored and reported on in 
the new political environment. HRC is also pleased to announce 
the appointment of Patrick Kelly as national director of the 
organisation. He replaces Safoora Sadek who resigned to take up 
a seat in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
provincial legislature.

<H8>  CONSTITUTION OF THE BOER VOLKSTAAT </H8>
<H5>  PREAMBLE </H5>
  WE, the descendants of the Vortrekkers and of those who 
sacrificed their lives and possessions for their nation and 
homeland in the First and Second Wars of Independence, and those 
who then and now identify themselves to the fullest with the 
Afrikaner Boer people's striving for freedom in a sovereign, 
independent homeland under their own government; IN HUMBLE 
GRATITUDE towards the Triune God, Disposer over the fate of 
nations and the histories of people, Who assembled our 
forefathers from many lands and established them here in their 
own, Who has determined their paths through the generations, Who 
has so providentially guided them through dangers; MINDFUL of 
the right of self-determination of peoples that is a part of 
prevailing international law and as such has the nature of 
jus cogens and is legally binding erga 
omnes, and that is recognized in the Charter of the United 
Nations, and as a consequence of which it is the inalienable 
right of every people to determine for itself its own existence 
without the interference of others, DECLARE hereby as 
representatives of the nation that: WE ARE COGNIZANT of our 
responsibility to God, the people, and our nation; WE ARE 
CONVINCED of the necessity for Afrikaners who are of common 
political purpose and aspiration to stand together for the 
purposes of: Protecting the political independence and 
territorial integrity of our country against attacks from within 
and without; Maintaining law and order therein; Advancing the 
fortunes and welfare of all therein; and THAT WE ARE WILLING at 
all times to do our duty towards our country and our 
fellow-citizens and to always treat noncitizens of the country 
with respect and esteem and TO COOPERATIVELY SEEK peace with all 
peace-loving peoples and with our neighboring peoples and 
communities in Southern Africa in particular, and to peacefully 
settle disputes where that is possible. TO THAT END we desire to 
carry out the mandate from God and our people to establish our 
own Volkstaat [homeland] with a Constitution that will adapt and 
incorporate the best of the traditions and history of our 
Fatherland. TO THAT END we now present our people in their own 
Fatherland with the following constitution: 
<H8>  SECTION 1: CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES </H8>
<H5>  ARTICLE 1: DEFINITION </H5>
  The Boer Volkstaat is a free, sovereign, and independent 
state based on Christian principles. 
<H5>  ARTICLE 2: SOVEREIGNTY </H5>
  In recognition of the Triune God who holds in His hands the

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Mandela's Cabinet -- An editorial in Johannesburg WEEKEND 
STAR in English on 7-8 May on page 8 describes Nelson Mandela's 
cabinet "with De Klerk's appointment as second deputy president 
assured," as "a good blend of the new and old." It notes the 
"one striking omission" Cyril Ramaphosa, officially explained as 
choosing "to stay out to guide the ANC during the next five 
years." "Ramaphosa's decision not to accept another cabinet post 
is reported to have come after his chief rival Thabo Mbeki, got 
the nod as first deputy president" and as "heir apparent to 
Mandela." Mbeki is a "worthy deputy president," but his 
appointment "does nothing to counter perceptions of the ANC as 
an organization which favors Xhosas." Alfred Nzo as foreign 
minister "comes as an unpleasant surprise," due to his 
"reputation for inefficiency" and Joe Modise as minister of 
defense is "worrying too," as he was "named in a an ANC 
investigation" as "negligent of the rights of internees in ANC 
detention camps. "Mandela's 17 ANC appointments leave 10 
vacancies for other parties, thought to include Derek Keys for 
finance and Roelf Meyer for constitutional affairs. 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Celebration of Unity and Democracy -- "A new age now begins 
in South Africa. The elections have produced so neat a result, 
such a tidy balance of contending political forces, so as to 
give a compelling logic to the idea of a government of national 
unity," notes an editorial in Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES in 
English on 8 May on page 24. President-elect Mandela has already 
"sketched the themes of his administration as conciliation, 
nation-building, and upliftment of the poor," a vision "perhaps 
best summed up in the newly popular slogan: one nation, many 
cultures." "To give effect to his intentions, Mr Mandela knows, 
the government must first restore confidence in South Africa's 
future, especially among such key elites as local and foreign 
investors" and "he has moved swiftly to do so. The decision to 
keep Dr Chris Stals at the Reserve Bank and Mr Derek Keys as 
Finance Minister could not have been easy for a man surrounded, 
as he still is, by 60s-era social engineers, but it has put two 
crucial pieces into place." While the "new spirit of 
conciliation will be severely tested" by the "troubles that lie 
ahead," "it is proper and understandable if South African hearts 
swell with pride" as "we have wroght a miracle, we have made a 
democracy." 
<H8>  RAPPORT </H8>
  President Mandela, a New Era -- "When Mr. Mandela is 
inaugurated on Tuesday as the Republic of South Africa's state 
president, the country not only enters into a totally new and 
unknown political era, but the new head of state reaches a 
milestone one only reads about in fairy tales," says an 
editorial in Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 8 May on page 
20. "To sit in jail for 27 years and then be welcomed as a hero 
by his people, to feel at home in the presence of princes and 
statesmen, to be a part of an intense negotiations process, over 
seventy-years-of-age and still able to keep to a busy schedule 
which could cause many younger men to stumble, to be politically 
and socially active after three decades of personal isolation, 
and then to fill the highest post in the country, is unique 
indeed for any leader in world history. RAPPORT has been and is 
still Mr. Mandela's political opponent, and has no reason to 
embrace him or the ANC. Mr. Mandela probably feels the same 
about RAPPORT. Politically, the struggle goes on. RAPPORT, as 
an opposition newspaper will play its watchdog role together 
with other critical South African media with intensified 
alertness, especially concerning the interests of the Afrikaans 
speaking community. But, on the eve of Mr. Mandela's 
inauguration we wish him well." "Mr. de Klerk, outgoing state 
president, with his outgoing government, carry with them the 
wounds of challenging reforms." "RAPPORT did not always agree 
with Mr. de Klerk's way of handling the whole reform process, 
but from start to finish he acted in a very dignified manner, 
and gracefully handled the difficult situations." "We extend 
our good wishes to Mr. de Klerk who clearly showed the world 
that this land, especially the Afrikaner who governed till now, 
has not discarded the policies of civilization, good manners and 
goodwill on the highest level."

<H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>
  Whites `Laid the Foundation' for Prosperous South Africa -- 
"The people, the vast majority of whom are Black, have spoken 
and are celebrating their liberation with the joy that the ANC's 
victory gives them," declares the page-6 editorial in 
Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 6 May. "Neither they, 
nor the outside world, will shed a tear for the demise of White 
rule. Yet it will not be amiss to say that the legacy left to 
Mr Mandela and his government has not all been bad." Apartheid 
was "a grim abandonment of human values and rights, causing 
great suffering and holding back a people in most spheres of 
life. But as a country we have progressed to become a 
powerhouse in sub-Saharan Africa, a country that has a solid 
foundation for growth, a developing country with First World as 
well as Third World standards, a country that can bring to all 
its people the benefits of modern technology and great 
entrepreneurial skills." THE CITIZEN believes white South 
Africans "deserve to be recognised as a people who laid the 
foundation for what is going to be a prosperous and wonderful 
country." 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  New Cabinet ANC-Loaded -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
on 
9 May in a page-10 editorial notes that South Africans are 
entitled to "feel a quiet pride" at the formation of the 
Government of National Unity (GNU). However, "it is a pity that 
the GNU Cabinet should be quite as ANC-loaded as it is, 
particularly after all the honeyed protestations of 
inclusiveness that have dripped from the nation's rooftops in 
recent weeks. Worse, an alarm bell has already rung loudly, 
although so far overlooked in the election over Nelson Mandela's 
victory speech.@??Zn? in the middle of that speech, Mandela 
seemed to reveal his understanding of the way his party's 
partners in cabinet are required to behave. Their views were to 
be accommodated...'within the context of the Reconstruction and 
Development Programme'." "Alarm bell indeed. Insofar as 
Mandela is urging his about-to-be Cabinet partners to serve 
reconstruction (small r) and go in for development (small d), 
good and well. If he is insisting that they unquestioningly 
imbibe a party programme with which they have major arithmetical 
difficulty, not so. 'National Unity' cannot merely mean 
permitting a token opposition presence in the Cabinet room. It 
must mean two-way adjustment. Most adjusting, fair to say, must 
come from the minority parties; but not all. Mandela seems to 
see his partners as a set of voluntary hostages. He must revise 
that view before it leads to tears." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Mandela's `Curious' Cabinet Appointments -- The page-12 
editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 May 
comments on President Nelson Mandela's "more curious provisional 
Cabinet appointments." The "impending reappointment of Derek 
Keys to the Finance portfolio is, from business's perspective, a 
bonus. With Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals's mid-year 
reappointment already as good as confirmed, Mandela probably 
need not have gone that far to convince business of his good 
intentions." However, Mandela should realize that Keys "is not, 
like some other NP [National Party] Cabinet possibilities, a yes 
man. A discordant note was struck in Mandela's victory speech 
on Monday, when he warned that Cabinet partners would have to 
accept the ANC's reconstruction and development programme, 
failing which there would be serious strains. Yes, the ANC has 
a clear mandate to make the RDP the basis of the new 
government's programme, but Keys will put his foot down if he 
believes it necessary in the interest of good fiscal management. 
Mandela should not take that as a sign of hostility to 
reconstruction and development per se. And, if Keys felt 
compelled to resign over such a dispute, the effects on investor 
confidence could be dire." BUSINESS DAY believes Alfred Nzo was 
appointed foreign minister as "a reward for past services, but 
he is "likely to be ineffectual in Foreign Affairs." "The two 
main security portfolios -- Defence and Police -- are the most 
worrying. Prospective Police Minister Sidney Mufamadi's 
three-year reign as head of the ANC's peace desk was uninspired 
as the country descended into violence. Proposed Defence 
Minister Joe Modise is held in high esteem only by factions of 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] and a 
few others. Assuming the NP is still fighting for one of these 
two posts, it would do Mandela no harm to concede the point." 
"There are, in the end, two grounds for consolation regarding 
Mandela's less-inspired choices. Weak ministers can be carried 
if they have competent directors-general and other senior 
officials. They can also be removed at the President's will."

<F P=106> [Address by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu at the Grand </F>
Parade, Cape Town -- live] 
  [Text] Good afternoon. Let me introduce those who are on 
the balcony before we introduce the person we have come to see. 
We want to introduce the state president and deputy state 
president-elect, Mr. F.W. de Klerk -- give him a warm hand. 
[applause] Thank you. And then we want to introduce the deputy 
state president-elect, Thabo Mbeki [applause], and Mrs. Zanele 
Mbeki. [applause] I want to introduce to you the chief justice, 
Mr. Justice Corbett, and Mrs. Corbett. [applause] And then we 
want to introduce Her Worship, the Mayor of Cape town, Alderman 
(Patricia Cryner), and the Mayoress, Mrs. (Di Barrell). 
  Friends, this is the day that the Lord has made, and we will 
rejoice and be glad in it. This is the day for which we have 
waited for over 300 years. This is the day of liberation for 
all of us, black and white together. This is the day of 
celebration. My fellow citizens -- hey, I can rightly call you 
fellow citizens, for on 27 and 28 April South Africa voted, and 
millions of us voted for the very first time, and a miracle 
happened. We discovered that we were South Africans, and we 
have discovered that we are proud of that fact. 
  Yesterday at the FNB [First National Bank] Stadium I sang 
"Die Stem" ["The Voice"] for the very first time in my life, and 
I loved it. Who will ever forget the picture of Tokyo Sexwale 
taking the salute as the SAP [South African Police] and the SADF 
[South African Defense Force] filed past? 
  A new South Africa has come to birth. We have said a 
resounding no to racism. What have we said to racism? What 
have we said to injustice? What have we said to oppression? 
What have we said to hatred? What have we said to violence? 
What have we said to alienation and division? 
  And we have said a loud and reverberating yes to freedom. 
What have we said to freedom? What have we said to 
reconciliation? Yes. What have we said to forgiveness? What 
have we said to peace? What have we said to unity? We of many 
cultures, languages, and races are become one nation. We are 
the rainbow people of God, and one man embodies this new spirit 
of reconciliation and unity. One man inspires us all. One man 
inspires the whole world. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, fellow 
South Africans, I ask you, welcome our brand new state president 
-- out of the box -- Nelson Mandela.

<F P=106> [Address by President-elect Nelson Mandela at the Grand </F>
Parade in Cape Town on 9 May; issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR 
Wire Service] 
  [Text] Mr Master of Ceremonies, Your Excellencies, members 
of the diplomatic corps, my fellow South Africans, today we are 
entering a new era for our country and its people. Today we 
celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the 
people of South Africa. 
  Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties 
that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South 
Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our 
country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled 
for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian 
or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand. 
  Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the 
Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our 
new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries 
ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of 
Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this 
peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and 
scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the 
sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic 
wars of resistance were fought. 
  When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated 
by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the 
spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For 
three centuries that island was seen as a place to which 
outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were 
incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance 
fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed 
this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit 
of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre. 
  We have fought for a democratic constitution since the 
1880s. 
Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the 
people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their 
aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter 
pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among 
South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day 
arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people. 
We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians, 
Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a 
common vision of a better life for the people of this country. 
  It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted 
the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision 
spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is 
also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as 
policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before 
South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship. 
  In the 1980s the African National Congress was still 
setting the pace, being the first major political formation in 
South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which 
we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete 
expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a 
constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless 
of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual 
orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of 
all citizens. 
  They project a democracy in which the government, whomever 
that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules, 
embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the 
country as it pleases. 
  Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is 
especially true in a country such as ours where the vast 
majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the 
same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political 
and other minorities be safeguarded. 
  In the political order we have established there will be 
regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government - 
central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social 
order which respects completely the culture, language and 
religious rights of all sections of our society and the 
fundamental rights of the individual. 
  The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated 
us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority 
lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work 
with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the 
future. The cornerstone of building a better life of 
opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program 
of social upliftment in the history of this country. The 
Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of 
purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work 
together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and 
build a nation united in our diversity. 
  The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections. 
They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan 
is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to 
guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the 
widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our 
people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to 
support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a 
central role we will try to change our country from a net 
exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products 
through beneficiation. 
  The government will devise policies that encourage and 
reward 
productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities - 
African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we 
can assist them to make inroads into the productive and 
manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale 
distribution to which they are presently confined. 
  To raise our country and its people from the morass of 
racism 
and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a 
government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will 
assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction 
and development of our battered society. 
  While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit 
of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate 
and bring about the change that our mandate from the people 
demands. 
  We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South 
Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the 
conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the 
past with the intent of constructing a new order based on 
justice for all. 
  This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today, 
and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.

<F P=106> [By Angela Quintal] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The National Land 
Committee [NLC] has urged the new government to urgently review 
the property rights and restitution clauses of the interim Bill 
of Rights -- which it claims severely limits land reform -- or 
face unprecedented chaos in rural areas with landless 
communities forcibly reoccupying land. At a Johannesburg news 
conference on Monday [9 May], the committee said it was 
particularly concerned about constitutionally entrenched 
market-related compensation for farmers whose land might be 
expropriated. If it was calculated at "market value" then 
farmers would be enriched for the second time -- first they were 
enriched through apartheid when they bought their land cheaply 
-- when the state bought back the land, spokesperson Lydia 
Mariha said. [sentence as received] The committee said the 
market-related formula would leave no resources to continue with 
an effective redistribution programme. 
  The national land committee said it was a pity the African 
National Congress had not attained the required two-thirds 
majority to change the constitution. It felt hopeful, however, 
that the ANC would review the property rights and restitution 
clauses, as promised by President-elect Nelson Mandela in his 
meeting with community representative in March this year. 
  Turning to redistribution, the NLC said it welcomed the 
ANC's 
commitment to redistribute "30 per cent of the land in the first 
five years" as set out in its Reconstruction and Development 
Programme. As the ANC had said state land alone would be used 
for the purpose of redistribution and restitution, the 
government's ability to fulfil its commitment would be severely 
limited. The World Bank's figures of available arable state 
land, about 250,000 hectares, would not be nearly enough for 
these objective, it stressed. 
  By the South African Agricultural Union's own admission only 
20 per cent of farmers produced 80 per cent of the country's 
present agricultural produce. The land owned by the remaining 
80 per cent should therefore be used for redistribution and for 
aspirant black farmers, the committee said. 
  Although it welcomed the land claims court proposal unveiled 
by the ANC, the committee said the court would work only if it 
ran alongside "broader processes of land redistribution, 
agricultural reform and restructuring of the administrative 
structures in local government". The cases the land claims 
court had been set up to deal with represented only "the tip of 
the iceberg" and a comprehensive land reform process would be 
needed to resolve the problems of groups who would not benefit 
from the court, including communities with no land and those 
that did have claims to a specific piece of land. 
  The Land Committee also expressed fears that landless 
people's expectations would be pushed aside in favour of white 
farmers' expectations and that unaccountable officials might be 
appointed in the government's land ministries and departments. 
Communities were expecting the new government to protect them 
from evictions and to guarantee security of tenure. In 
particular they demanded the moratorium on evictions, which was 
drawn up by the Transitional Executive Council, be extended 
through the transition period. 
  The NLC warned that if a new government shied away from 
tackling the issue of land reform, and was seen as siding with 
the white farming community, then rural communities would "feel 
forced to reoccupy their land". 
  Transvaal Rural Action Committee spokesman Star Motswege 
added communities were organising themselves already and if 
their demands were not met within a certain period, a number of 
them would forcibly reoccupy land. 
  The National Land Committee's Brendan Pearce said 11 
communities in the Northern Cape had taken a resolution before 
the elections to go back to their land by force if necessary. 
One such community had already done so and 150 people were 
arrested for trespassing. Mr Pearce said if there was no 
substantial progress then more communities would resort to the 
same action. 
  Mr Dave Husy, of the farmworkers resource and research 
programme, said if the constitution could not be amended because 
of the ANC's failure to achieve a two-thirds majority, a crisis 
situation might erupt in rural areas and parliament would be 
forced to change the property and restitution clauses for the 
sake of peace in these areas.

  [Text] We told you earlier that the interim head of state, 
His Excellency Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, visited Isare today, 
after reassuring those persons who had taken refuge at the Unity 
Monument and his residence in Kiriri. They were from (Imuyira), 
(Sororezo) and (Rweza). He asked them to return to their homes. 
The people claimed that they were fleeing following shooting 
incidents in their areas last night. They said that the 
shooting was carried out by the soldiers. You heard this in our 
midday bulletins. Therefore we asked the army's spokesman, 
Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Bosco Daradangwa, for the truth of the 
matter: 
  [Begin Daradangwa recording] It is true that some people 
fled their homes after hearing the shooting. As you know, last 
week the disarmament of the population was launched. You know 
that the process started [words indistinct]. Some of the rebels 
escaped. In some places the people, in conjuction with security 
forces, discovered where they were hiding. One of the hiding 
places is in Muyira, at a place called Kirombwe. That is why 
the Armed Forces are now trying to dislodge 200 people from 
there. It is the shooting between those people and the Armed 
Forces which made the the citizens flee in fear. [end recording] 
  Daradangwa also told us that the Armed Forces captured guns 
and other weapons, such as grenades.

  [Text] The man behind the strikes which paralyzed the 
Cameroonian public sector last year has fallen victim to an 
internal coup in the country's main trade unions federation. 
(Louis Sombe) has been picked up by the security forces, and 
the man suspected of being behind his fall is a supporter of 
Cameroon's ruling party, the CPDM [Cameroon People's Democratic 
Movement], as Victor Apie Ngome reports in this telex from 
Yaounde: 
  (Louis Sombe), the controversial secretary general of 
Cameroon's Confederation of Trade Unions, was arrested in his 
office this morning together with his son and four other people. 
Mr. (Sombe) was having an early briefing session with some of 
his staff, when, after a manner that has become customary in 
Cameroon, policemen armed with tear gas canisters, truncheons, 
and submachine guns stormed the premises and whisked him away in 
a white Peugeot car toward unknown destination. His son and the 
other four people were driven off in a different direction. It 
appears that the union's president, Etame Ndedi, recently 
ordered (Sombe)'s dismissal, saying that the union had found him 
guilty of indiscipline, but Mr. (Sombe) ignored the order, 
saying that Mr. Etame Ndedi's so-called disciplinary committee 
had no power to sack him. Mr. Ntame Ndedi also hinted that Mr. 
(Sombe)'s financial records were not straight. Union sources say 
Mr. Ntame Ndedi had always complained that Mr. (Sombe)'s salary 
was too high and that he was living in luxury. Most union staff 
boycotted this morning's swearing in of the union's new 
secretary general, in solidarity with Mr. (Sombe), who is still 
widely respected as the workers' real representative. Many 
people have been expecting this arrest to happen and they 
believe that Mr. (Sombe)'s sacking has been masterminded by the 
government, in order to stop him leading a general strike in 
June. Mr. (Sombe) joined the massive strikes that paralyzed the 
civil service last December, thereby falling out with Mr. Ntame 
Ndedi, who is a member of the central committee of the ruling 
CPDM party, and who was against December's strike.

  [Text] With it being over eight months since the Central 
African Republic [CAR]'s general elections, you might have 
assumed that any argument about outcome would be over by now, 
but far from it. The Supreme Court has just decided that there 
were irregularities and much to opposition dismay. President 
Patasse's government stands to gain more seats in parliament. 
From Bangui, Joseph Benamsse telexed this report. 
  According to the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme 
Court, 
three opposition deputies are suspended from Parliament because 
of irregularities that took place in the parliamentary elections 
of August 1993. Following submission of this verdict to the 
Ministry of the Interior, a new round of legislative elections 
in three districts will be held within 45 days. The areas 
affected are all districts where President Patasse's MLPC 
[Central African People's Liberation Movement] Party did not win 
sits. They include a suburb of Bangui and two districts, west 
and northwest of the capital. Speculation is rife in Bangui that 
the MLPC are trying to gain these three seats for themselves as 
they do not currently hold the majority in Parliament. With 33 
out of a total 85 parliamentary seats, they technically need 10 
more to hold the majority, but in practice they have been able 
to count on a number of allies to vote for them thus far. 
Cracks, however, are now appearing in the informal coalitions 
in Parliament and the MLPC looks set to lose a couple of their 
former supporters. And so, if they won these three seats, they 
would be able to maintain their position.

  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 9 May (AFP) -- Fierce fighting erupted 
in Kigali on Monday [9 May] between government troops and rebels 
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) forcing a United Nations 
plane heading to the wartorn country to return to Nairobi. The 
Hercules C-130 from the Canadian Air Force had left Nairobi at 
10:00 A.M. (0700 GMT) but midway through the flight was ordered 
to return to Nairobi because of the battles in Kigali. 
  Abdul Kabia, spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR) said the fighting began at 0800 GMT in various 
parts of the capital including the military camp in Kanombe, 
near the Kigali airport and the rebel headquarters. He said one 
mortar fell on the airport runway but did not cause any 
injuries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, May 9 (AFP) -- Rebel artillery gunners 
pounded government-held parts of Rwanda's capital Kigali on 
Monday [9 May] in what could be a final push to seize control 
despite separate ceasefire offers by both camps. 
  During the heaviest fighting yet in a month of bloodletting, 
a mortar round slammed into the airport runway, forcing a United 
Nations relief plane to turn back to the Kenyan capital Nairobi, 
a UN spokesman said. 
  The fiercest artillery duels erupted around the Kanombe Army 
Camp near the airport, spokesman Abdul Kabia said. 
  The UN cancelled flights ferrying in desperately needed 
medicines and food for the second time in a week, said Kabia, 
contacted by telephone in Kigali. 
  "We're reinforcing our positions and trying to control those 
that can be tactically important," said a spokesman for the 
rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) contacted by telephone at 
rebel headquarters in Mulindi, northern Rwanda. 
  Government forces have deployed artillery around the 
airport, 
making it a key target for the rebels, who claim to control half 
the country. 
  The spokesman said the RPF would guarantee security for UN 
relief flights to preserve Kigali's only lifeline once it had 
cleared out the army gunners around the airport who are shelling 
rebel headquarters in the old parliament building. 
  Monday's flareup after a relatively quiet weekend shattered 
hopes of a truce after the RPF and government separately 
announced unilateral ceasefires that should have taken effect at 
the weekend. 
  "We are open to dialogue but only with army commanders who 
do 
not recognise the government's authority," the rebel spokesman 
said. 
  Before they stop fighting, the rebels want an end to the 
slaughter of Tutsis and Hutu opposition supporters in which 
200,000 people have died. It all started when president Juvenal 
Habyarimana was killed in an April 6 plane crash that his 
security forces blamed on a rebel-fired rocket. 
  Half a million Rwandans have swarmed over the borders to 
neighbouring countries, with 250,000 sheltering in the world's 
biggest makeshift refugee camp in northern Tanzania. 
  Foreigners who left Kigali on Sunday saw dismembered bodies, 
and reports from around the country also indicated that the 
bloodbath was continuing. 
  Food is running short, and a lack of water purification 
chemicals has raised fears of cholera. 
  The international aid agency Caritas estimates that two 
million people risk famine in Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi, 
which shares Rwanda's history of feuding between the majority 
Hutus and minority Tutsis who make up about 15 percent of the 
population in both countries. 
  The Red Cross meanwhile planned to evacuate some of 
thousands 
of wounded people from Kigali hospital to a newly set up field 
hospital in Kabgayi, about 45 kilometres (27 miles) southwest of 
the capital.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 10 (AFP) -- A Ghanaian UN soldier was 
killed in Kigali when he was hit by shrapnel from mortar fire 
near a stadium in the capital, a UN statement said. Ghanaian UN 
troops and more than 3,000 refugees were using Amahoro stadium 
as a shelter, a UN statement said. 
  The stadium has been turned into a temporary shelter for 
people who have tried to escape the brutal ethnic massacres 
hitting the tiny east African country, according to the UN 
statement obtained here Monday. It said he was the 11th soldier 
in the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda killed in Rwanda since 
the country slid back into civil war last month after President 
Juvenal Habyarimana was killed in a suspicious airplane crash.

  [Text] The commander of the Rwanda Patriotic Front, RPF, 
Major General Paul Kagame, has said the United Nations' proposal 
to send an intervention force at this stage amounts to 
complicity in the massacre of the innocent people. 
  In an interview with Kampala's capital radio, Major Kagame 
criticized the United Nations for pulling out its peacekeeping 
forces at the height of the massacres, and he did not see why 
they now want to come back. He said it would appear that they 
want to protect those who are carrying out the massacres. 
  He said the struggle of the RPF to bring the situation under 
control is worth it. He stressed that capturing Kigali, on 
which the RPF now has a strong grip, might not solve the 
problem, and they are trying to bring the situation in the whole 
country under control. He said it is now just a matter of time 
to accomplish this task. He admitted that many people have lost 
their lives in the struggle to end the massacre.

  [Text] Chief of Staff General Robert Mboma has urged 
persons living along the border not to fear developments 
unfolding in some neighboring states. He stated this today in 
Bukoba, while meeting with commanders and servicemen from the 
Tanzania People's Defense Force [TPDF] at (Ramusenye) and 
Kaboya, following an expression of concern by the public. 
  General Mboma told the servicemen they must strengthen their 
defenses to assuage the fears of those people living in areas 
bordering certain neighboring countries, some of whom had 
decided to move away from their home districts. He said that 
people must be confident, since the TPDF had the task of 
defending the Constitution, the country's borders, and its 
citizens. 
  Regarding the Rusumo Bridge, he asked them to consolidate 
their defenses and to ensure that the bridge was not destroyed, 
as its destruction would be a disgrace to the TPDF.

  [Text] The commanding officer of the Bundibugyo Battalion, 
Captain (John Tumwebaze), has urged RC's [resistance committees] 
in Bundibugyo to be on the lookout for Zairean antigovernment 
rebels who are crossing into Uganda as a result of hot pursuit 
by government troops. 
  Capt. (Tumwebaze) cautioned the RC's that many of the rebels 
possessed guns that may cause insecurity in Bundibugyo, a 
district renowned for maintaining peace and security. He 
appealed to the people of Bundibugyo to report any suspicious 
character to security personnel. Capt. (Tumwebaze), who was 
speaking at a district development committee meeting in 
Bundibugyo, disclosed that many Zairean rebels have been 
intercepted by Ugandan troops guarding the Uganda-Zaire border. 
He said the fleeing rebels revealed that they have been 
overpowered by government troops following the death of their 
two leaders.

  [Text] Bissau, 5 May (AFP) -- Six Guinea-Bissau opposition 
parties today decided to form an alliance in order to defeat the 
former single ruling African Party for the Independence of 
Guinea- Bissau and Cape Verde in the country's planned 
multiparty elections. 
  According to Joao da Costa, chairman of the Party for 
Renovation and Development [PRD], the alliance, in addition to 
the PRD, includes the Democratic Front, the Social Democratic 
Front, the Ecological Protection League, the Movement for 
Democracy, and the Democratic and Progress Party. This alliance 
will soon elect a single presidential candidate, Mr. da Costa 
disclosed, announcing on the occasion his decision to step down 
from the presidential race. 
  After a first postponement in 1992, President Joao Bernardo 
Vieira again postponed Guinea-Bissau's first multiparty 
presidential and parliamentary elections indefinitely on 22 
March -- a week to the scheduled date -- for "technical 
reasons." President Vieira is standing for reelection. No firm 
date has so far been announced for the holding of these 
elections despite the completion of a population census on 23 
April.

  [Text] The leader of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of 
Liberia], President Charles Gankay Taylor, has written a letter 
to the chairman of ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], Beninese President 
Nicephore Soglo, raising serious concerns over the direction the 
Liberian peace process is taking. 
  In the letter, President Taylor informed the ECOWAS chairman 
that the Liberian peace process has lost its momentum, the 
outcome of which could be disastrous. He said unless the 
elements of government dealing with the Cotonou Accord are put 
into play by 22 May this year, the leadership of the NPFL will 
be constrained to consider other alternatives. President Taylor 
stressed that if the NPFL agreed-upon rights are ignored, it 
will have to be considered nonpartisan and (?imagine) itself 
otherwise in the peace process. 
  The commander in chief of the NPFL, President Taylor, has 
repeated his call for the immediate establishment of a 
Transitional National Army of Liberia. The NPFL leader stressed 
the need for the three parties to the Cotonou Accord to begin 
providing soldiers for the formation of the transitional army. 
The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly 
Government] president said it is in the national security 
interest of this nation to form a national army. He asked, and 
we quote him, if this country is totally disarmed, can we leave 
the security of this nation solely in the hands of an alien 
army? President Taylor said Liberians need to cautiously 
reflect on this question and move towards the immediate 
establishment of a Transitional National Army. 
  Presently, the Liberian National Transitional Government has 
no army of its own, leaving ECOMOG as the only troops to provide 
national security.

  [Text] President Taylor has urged the Liberian Council of 
State to review its internal rules. He said there is a need for 
the State Council to review its rules, with the view of making 
it more open. 
  The president has extended an open invitation to the Council 
of State of the Liberian Transitional Government to visit 
Gbarnga and the rest of the country. He said it is important 
for the Council of State to visit Gbarnga and other parts of the 
country, to fully establish its authority throughout Liberia. 
The president said, if the Council of State does not 
immediately take up the invitation to visit Gbarnga and the rest 
of the country, it will be placing its authority in question. 
  The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] leader 
stressed the need for the Council of State to fully establish 
its authority throughout the Republic of Liberia, as spelled out 
in the Cotonou Accord.
