  [Text] Monrovia, 10 May (AFP) -- Two rival clans fighting 
within one of Liberia's armed factions, the United Liberation 
Movement (ULIMO), met here Monday [9 May] in a bid to settle the 
two-month conflict. Two earlier attempts at ending the fighting 
between the Mandingos and the Krahns, had ended in failure. 
Several hundred people have been killed in clashes that have 
mostly centred on the Bomi region to the north and west of 
Monrovia. 
  ULIMO president Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo clan and the 
movement's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson of the 
Krahns, met at the headquarters of the West African peacekeeping 
force ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. ULIMO secretary-general Isaac 
Quawah said afterwards that there had been no breakthrough but 
added, "We are determined to reach an agreement." 
  The feud centres on the distribution of posts of 
responsibility within ULIMO, with the Krahns accusing Kromah of 
favouring the Mandingos, although membership of the movement is 
equally divided between the two. ECOMOG has been trying for two 
months to disarm Liberia's warring factions, but has only 
succeeded in disarming some 3,000 out of a total of some 60,000 
combatants as the fighting goes on unchecked in ULIMO-controlled 
areas. 
  Hostilities have also continued in central and eastern 
regions under the control of ULIMO's rival National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia, which has since last September been fending 
off attacks by armed militiamen in the Liberian Peace Council. 
  NPFL head Charles Taylor accepted a proposition Friday by 
the 
LPC to start peace talks in Monrovia this week to negotiate an 
end to the fighting under United Nations and ECOMOG mediation. 
If the ULIMO clans can along with the LPC and the NPFL strike a 
lasting settlement, that would provide the impetus for the UN 
and ECOMOG to bring all the belligerent groups to the 
negotiating table in order to end the conflict which has wracked 
the country since December 1989.

  [Text] The Yoruba community in the troubled Bakassi 
peninsula has appealed to the government, obas, and the chiefs 
of some states to (?assist) it to resume their present 
activities. The states include Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, and 
Ondo. In their written plea to these states, members of the 
community, who are mainly fishermen and traders, gave the 
details of the atrocities committed against them by Cameroonian 
gendarmes. This includes the illegal seizure of their fishing 
boats, the imposition and forceful collection of Cameroonian 
taxes, the burning of their homes, and looting of their 
property. They urged the administrators and the traditional 
rulers as well as other leaders to channel assistance to the 
Cross River State Government.

<F P=106> [By Ade Obisesan] </F>
  [Excerpt] Lagos, 9 May (AFP) -- Lagos workers on Monday [9 
May] largely failed to heed a stay-at-home call by Nigeria's 
opposition Campaign for Democracy (CD) in protest against the 
military regime of General Sani Abacha. Hundreds of people made 
their way to work in the sprawling commercial metropolis, while 
journalists told AFP that the protest call was also ignored in 
the federal capital Abuja and the second business city, Kano in 
the north. Not many commercial vehicles were seen in Lagos 
early Monday, but this may have been due to a persistent fuel 
shortage and rain early in the morning, observers said. 
  The CD, an umbrella grouping for some 40 pro-democracy and 
human rights organisations, last week called on workers across 
Nigeria to stay at home Monday in its first protest against the 
latest military regime, which it described as "illegitimate". 
But the Campaign failed to win the support of the Nigeria 
Labour Congress (NLC), which urged workers not to follow the CD 
call, warning that it would not be able to defend any of them if 
they abstained from work. "It does not make any sense to embark 
on any strike action now," an NLC official told AFP on Monday. 
"The call looks senseless and ill-timed as there seems to be no 
justification for it." 
  The Lagos State government, in a special early morning radio 
announcement urged workers to go to their jobs and described the 
CD's call as "unpatriotic and irrational." 
  The call for protest was seen as a test of support for the 
CD, which last Tuesday issued a statement blaming the Abacha 
regime for the "catastrophic" state of Nigeria. The country, 
though a major oil producer, was then gripped by drastic fuel 
shortages, which led the military government to call in 
representatives of oil companies to discuss measures to remedy 
the situation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Sierra Leone, 16 ministers and eight top ranking 
civil servants who served under former President Joseph Momoh 
were arrested over the weekend for failing to reimburse money 
they had acquired illegally during their service. This matter 
involves several hundreds of thousands of dollars. The current 
justice minister had given the former ministers a three-week 
deadline to refund the money, but they failed to meet it. 
  In other news, the Revolutionary United Front launched an 
attack on government positions yesterday. According to local 
journalists, the attack backfired, as the rebels reportedly lost 
15 of their men.

  [Text] Freetown, 10 May (AFP) -- Fifteen rebels of the 
Revolutionary United Front [RUF] and ten civilians were killed 
in a dawn attack by the guerrillas Sunday [8 May] near Kenema, 
240 kilometres (150 miles) east of Freetown, local journalists 
said. Government troops alerted by the sound of firing from the 
attack on Mano Junction had counter-attacked and driven the 
rebels off, they said. 
  For the past week the government has been engaged in an 
offensive against the RUF in the east of the country. Military 
sources said 52 rebels and ten government troops were killed in 
the first six days of the operation. The Defence Ministry also 
said a RUF training camp at Kerefay near Makeni, 140 kilometres 
northeast of Freetown, had been broken up last week and 60 
children aged from nine to 12 who had been forcibly recruited by 
the rebels had been freed.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda on 9 May; place </F>
not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] Bwanas and donas [ladies and gentlemen], good 
evening. Tonight I am speaking to you [word indistinct] joy and 
indeed with a sense of satisfaction for what we have 
accomplished in this country so far. I say this for a number of 
reasons. Next week, on Tuesday, that is on May the 17th, we 
shall be holding our general elections where Malawians will be 
exercising their democratic rights to elect those that will 
govern this country for the next five years. 
  Malawians will vote freely for the presidential and 
parliamentary candidates of their choice. I therefore wish to 
appeal to all registered voters to come in their large numbers 
on 17 May to cast their votes. They should not feel intimidated 
by anyone for any reason whatsoever. I want to assure every 
Malawian that the police and the Army will be vigilant on that 
day to ensure that no one disrupts the elections. [passage 
omitted] 
  It is understandable that as 17 May gets closer, passions in 
the political debates and in public meetings tend to get 
intensified. The political tensions that can result if such 
passions are not properly checked or handled can be most 
unfortunate, most unfortunate. As a people, who have been 
united, for all these years and have enjoyed peace and calm for 
31 continuous years, it would be most unfortunate if we allowed 
our [word indistinct] political differences to disturb our 
long-standing political stability. It is important that we 
remain united, peaceful, and calm. 
  We must always remember that despite our political 
differences we are all Malawians. We have lived together very 
peacefully for a long time, despite our tribal and cultural 
differences. There is, therefore, nothing to stop us from 
cohabiting happily as members of different political parties. 
We should behave like members of the same family who will 
always maintain family unity during difficult times, no matter 
how intense their differences or rivalry may be. As we approach 
the election day next week, the eyes of the world are focused on 
us. They are working to see if we can maintain our national 
peace and hold on to our long-standing political stability as we 
go through this period of vigorous political campaign and 
elections. I therefore appeal to all Malawians to behave like 
ladies and gentlemen during these elections as we have always 
done in equally sensitive situations in the past. We have 
already gone through the transition period so far in a peaceful 
and most commendable manner. Of course there have been some 
disturbances here and there, but these have been of a minor 
nature and to some extent have been understandable. [passage 
omitted] 
  The outside observers have commended us for the manner in 
which we have managed our transitions. [passage omitted] In some 
countries in our continent the tendencies of losing political 
parties have been to refuse to accept their defeat at the polls. 
Losing parties have challenged the results of free and fair 
elections. I think this was most unfortunate. I want all 
political leaders in this country to understand that contrary to 
the wishes of all of us, some political parties will (?instead) 
lose on 17 May. This is the nature of political competition in 
democracy. Political parties must, therefore, be realistic and 
accept their defeat gracefully, and the winning parties 
(?should) celebrate their victory with sympathy, understanding, 
and a high degree of political tolerance. [passage omitted] 
  I want them [international observers] to know that my 
government is committed and determined to have free and fair 
elections in this country. I hope that the external and 
internal observers intend to be objective and unbiased in their 
observations and reports on political events in this country. 
[passage omitted] 
  Similarly, I wish to acknowledge the presence of both the 
local and external press among us. We are indeed happy that we 
now have a free press in this country. We are glad that our 
young local pressmen and women are cooperating with their 
experienced colleagues from outside. During this critical 
period, it is my hope that the media will inform (?first) 
Malawians and the international public truthfully so that people 
are able to have unbiased opinions on the political process in 
this country. 
  Let me now end by thanking the various friendly governments, 
countries and international organizations who have helped us 
financially and materially with the smooth running of the 
transition and the coming elections themselves, by sponsoring 
seminars and workshops organized either by the government, the 
national consultative council, the electoral commission or other 
related committees. [passage omitted].

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Antonio Barros in Zambezia Province] </F>
  [Text] If the agreements reached between the government and 
Gimo Phiri's Mozambique Democratic Union, Udemo, are not 
complied with, a new war could erupt in Mozambique at any time 
before elections are held in October of this year. That threat 
was made by Jose Frederico Goncalves, Udemo's national chief for 
organization and mobilization. The Udemo was formed in the wake 
of differences between Carlos Reis, president of the Mozambican 
National Union, Unamo, and Gimo Phiri at the congress which 
resulted in Unamo's creation. 
  Gimo Phiri used to lead a force of some 2,000 men, who were 
subsequently confined to an assembly area in Milange. Some of 
those men have already been demobilized. Sources whom we have 
contacted have told us that all those men have been disarmed. 
  Goncalves has told Radio Mozambique in Milange, Zambezia 
Province, that the promises made by the Mozambique Liberation 
Front, Frelimo, are a left-wing coalition [as heard] because 
they are not being observed. He also said that the leader of 
those former armed forces will only leave the jungle once he 
obtains all the conditions that have been granted the Mozambique 
National Resistance, Renamo, leader. Despite our reporter's 
insistence, the Udemo national chief for organization and 
mobilization did not give any details concerning the nature of 
the agreements reached with the government. He simply said that 
his organization had been promised transportation and premises. 
  Political observers in Quelimane speculate that the 
government must have promised to confine and demobilize Gimo 
Phiri's forces, as well as to pay the salaries and subsidies to 
which all demobilized forces should be entitled. Gimo Phiri's 
forces are confined and are being demobilized in the same 
assembly area as the government forces in Milange. Goncalves 
said that Udemo is to become official and, depending on the 
government's response to the problem, it intends to participate 
in the elections scheduled for October. Meanwhile, contacts are 
continuing. 
  That Udemo official also said that the Mozambican ambassador 
to Malawi has been liaising between the government and his 
movement which, according to him, has its headquarters in the 
Namuli mountains, in Zambezia Province's Gurue District.

South African history, because he has turned out to be one of 
the greatest reformers, one of the greatest sons of our soil -- 
Mr. de Klerk. [applause] 
  We have on our left another deputy president who has never 
known his youth, the joys of youth, who plunged himself into the 
struggle the moment he realized what was happening in this 
country. The three of us are going to work together in order to 
build South Africa, to promote a spirit of reconciliation and to 
engage in nation-building. 
  Let us forget the past. Let us now work together to make 
this country a great country, and if you give us your support 
there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that we have a country 
that is going to play its role, not only in regard to our 
region, but throughout the continent and, indeed, throughout the 
world. 
  I ask you to pray for us because we need your prayers. I ask 
you to give us your whole-hearted support because we need you. 
We ask you to give us your good wishes because we need them. 
That is all we need in order to secure a better life for all of 
you. 
  The three of us have committed ourselves on various 
occasions, that this is what we are fighting this election for. 
Now we are one. We have forgotten our differences. We are now 
busy healing the wounds of the past, and it is for you to 
support us in that task. I thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by Second Executive Deputy President F.W. de Klerk </F>
to introduce UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali at The 
Presidency in Pretoria -- live] 
  [Text] President Mandela, Your Majesties, Your Royal 
Highnesses, heads of state, heads of government, Your 
Excellencies, all the dignitaries here, ladies and gentlemen: 
It is my great privilege to introduce our guest speaker, the 
secretary general of the United Nations. 
  Today is a great day for all South Africans. When Mr. 
Mandela shortly addressed the last crowd down on the lawns 
beneath the Union Buildings, his plea was that we should forget 
the past. I would like to add to that, that we as a nation will 
now stretch out to the future. We face tremendous challenges in 
South Africa. I'm confident that we will, in accepting those 
challenges, succeed in achieving the goal which we share with 
each other in the government of national unity, and that is, to 
bring lasting peace to our country, to bring new wealth to our 
country, and to use that new wealth in a caring manner, to 
improve the quality of life of all our people. [applause] 
  We also have, we believe, a pivotal role to play in our 
subcontinent, in Africa, and believe also in the international 
community. We have, to a certain extent, been starved of cross- 
pollination in the years of isolation. We have needs, if we 
look at the international community. We have needs in looking 
at the United Nations. We need much closer interaction. We 
need access to many of the world's resources in solving our own 
problems. But we also have something to give. We have 
expertise, applied technology to the conditions of Africa. [as 
heard] We have infrastructure, and we have a commitment to be a 
good neighbor to all our neighboring countries in southern 
Africa and higher up. [applause] 
  As a country we, therefore, stand ready, willing, and able 
to make a constructive and a positive contribution, but we need 
partners, and we pledge ourselves to work with the international 
community, to work with the United Nations, to work with other 
international agencies, and to work with the major leading 
countries of the world -- America, the European Union, Japan, 
and others - in addressing also problems far beyond our borders. 
It is for us a great honor to have so many heads of state, 
heads of government, and such eminent international leaders here 
today, and specifically, Mr. Secretary General, to have you here 
today, you who have brought a new dimension to the influence, 
success, and activities of the United Nations. We have watched 
carefully your career thus far, and we are impressed by what you 
have achieved through the United Nations in your term of office. 
We salute you. [applause] 
  We thank the United Nations and the European Union and the 
Commonwealth and the Organization of African Unity for their 
involvement in this election. The observers played an honorable 
role, and the United Nations, in coordinating their activities 
locally also played a leading role, and we thank them for it 
very specifically. [applause] The watching eyes of the observers 
I think ensured that there was inhibition on the side of those 
who might have had a tendency at times to become too exuberant. 
Mr. Secretary General, it is my great honor and pleasure to ask 
you to please address this eminent gathering. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by United Nations Secretary General Butrus </F>
Butrus-Ghali at the Presidency in Pretoria--live] 
  [Text] President Nelson Mandela, Your Majesties, Your 
Excellencies, distinguished guests. On behalf of the United 
Nations I congratulate you, Mr. President, on your inauguration 
today as state president of the Republic of South Africa 
[applause]. I congratulate Deputy President Mbeki and Deputy 
President de Klerk. Today we have been privileged to witness a 
turning point in the history of a nation. Today South Africa 
regains its rightful place in Africa, in the United Nations, and 
in the family of nations [applause]. 
  The United Nations raised its flag against the evil of 
apartheid. The world joined against it. Repeatedly the nations 
and peoples of the international community expressed their 
solidarity and support for the people of South Africa. We 
demonstrate that solidarity again by our presence, by your 
presence today. Today's celebrations really belong to all South 
Africans, whatever their party or affiliation. I pay tribute to 
all who had the vision to lead. I pay tribute to all who had 
the courage to join in this undertaking. I pay tribute to the 
international organizations and the member states who 
contributed, and who stood together with you. Guided by wise 
and able leaders, South Africa has earned the respect and the 
admiration of all. Tireless in the search of understanding and 
vigorous in the pursuit of peace, you have refused to let the 
difference defeat you. You, Mr. President, you have worked long 
and suffered greatly to see this day. The firmness of your 
resolve to build a new nonracial society in South Africa is not 
in doubt. Your resolve will be needed, your political will will 
be tested, but I'm confident that through your courage and 
determination you and South Africa will prevail. [applause] 
  Deputy President de Klerk, your vision and courage has 
contributed to this great day. You have won the lasting respect 
of all who yearned for justice. 
  I call on all nations and institutions and the programs and 
the agencies of the international community to support the new 
democracy in South Africa. I appeal to all South Africans to 
support the principles of tolerance and reconciliation, 
principles that provide the only sure foundation for peace, 
security and progress. The people of South Africa have spoken. 
You assume office, Mr. President, with a historic mandate, and 
supported by great goodwill. We welcome you with happiness. We 
embrace you with pride. 
  On behalf of the United Nations, and the agencies and the 
programs of the United Nations, I pledge our continued support 
for the achievements of dignity, equal rights, and social 
progress for all the people of this great country. [applause]

<F P=106> [Address by President Nelson Mandela at the Presidency in </F>
Pretoria; introduction by First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki-- 
live; broadcast in progress] 
  [Text] [Mbeki]...and because he is young, he lacks 
discipline. Deputy President de Klerk and myself have formed a 
disciplinary subcommittee, and in order to cover my back, he is 
going to chair the subcommittee. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, we as South Africans -- and I think, 
indeed, the world -- are very proud to have a person such as 
Nelson Mandela. [applause] I think it is true that among 
ourselves as South Africans, and among the peoples of the world, 
regardless of our political beliefs, of our differences in other 
ways, I think we all see ourselves reflected in his glory, and 
it is a glory that arises from his humility. It is a glory that 
arises from his sense of forgiveness. It is glory that arises 
from his sensitivity to human suffering. It is a glory that 
arises from his commitment to principle. Ladies and gentlemen, 
Nelson Mandela. [applause] 
  [Mandela] Many forces have influenced the history of our 
country, as they have done in the history of other countries. 
The workers, traditional leaders, and tribesmen from the 
countryside, educationists, economists, businessmen, religious 
leaders, all have played a role in our history. 
  But for one or two moments I want to talk about two forces 
which have been of particular relevance in the history of our 
country. We are aware of the type of government we have had 
since 1912 which relied on brute force and coercion. The many 
decades of that coercion only served to produce the Mbekis, the 
Sisulus, the Joe Slovos, the Brahm Fishers, the Dadoos, the 
Nickers, the Trevor Manuels, and they have become national 
heroes today, and some of them are now holding cabinet posts. 
They prevailed after a lot of bitterness had been created, and 
it is as a result of that policy that deep wounds have been 
created in our country. Coercion, brute force, impatience, the 
inability to sit down with your countrymen and to talk had the 
hand in another force, that of compassion, that of love and 
loyalty to your country, that of ignoring what is negative in a 
human being and concentrating on that which is good. Through 
dialogue, through persuasion, we have been able to bring South 
Africa out of that era of darkness, bitterness, pessimism, to a 
moment where the entire world has joined us to come and 
celebrate. 
  That is a lesson, not just for this day. It is a lesson on 
which we can build for the future. Perhaps it was fortunate 
that we had this era, because we are now able to appreciate the 
sacrifices that have been made by the Sisulus and the Mbekis and 
the others. We now know the caliber of the men and women of 
South Africa. South Africa is rich, and not only in natural 
wealth and gold, it is rich in the caliber of its men and women. 
We appreciate that and we have come to appreciate more because 
of the struggle that they have put forward. 
  But there is another aspect from the opposite direction. 
Among those who have been produced by apartheid there have been 
men and women with a vision who realized that human beings are 
human beings. I spent so many years in prison -- you will be 
surprised to know the friendships, the strong friendships which 
were built between black prisoners and white warders. It was 
difficult for the policy makers to persecute us as they wanted 
because we became friends with the warders in our passage. It 
is through them that we could be persecuted, and the firm 
friendships we formed were itself a protection. 
  I don't know whether my friends are here. I invited three of 
the warders who looked after me to attend these celebrations. I 
invited them...I invited them to come--or rather, I asked the 
committee that is arranging to invite them to come, because I 
wanted them to share in the joys that have emanated 
spontaneously around this day, because in a way they also 
contributed to it. 
  Then, of course, there is my friend Mr. de Klerk. He 
had...he was one of those who gave us a hard time. The late Dr. 
Danie Craven, the chairman of the South African Rugby Board, and 
Dr. Luyt, the chairman, I think, of the Southern Transvaal Rugby 
Board, they went to Harare to see the ANC, because they realized 
that South African rugby could not go back to international 
sport without going through the ANC. They knew that the key to 
international rugby was ANC. They did a good thing. It was good 
for them, they had foresight. They suppressed all their 
prejudices and realized that this is the organization that would 
help them. When they came back they were chastised by Mr. de 
Klerk for having had discussions with a terrorist organization. 
Now I mention this as a measure of the change here undergone, 
the personal courage, the vision, the honesty, the integrity 
with which he came to examine the situation in South Africa and 
used his enormous power as the head of the government to bring 
about reforms. 
  So we have forgotten the past. We must know the past so that 
when we work together now in a government of national unity we 
must know precisely what we have come through, what we should 
avoid. 
  We said a lot of unkind things about one another during the 
election [laughter], but we have fought the election. We have 
had a good fight. Now it is the time for us to put together the 
broken pieces of our country and to ensure that our people speak 
with one voice. We feel that because of the many years of 
discussions we have had before I was released from jail -- I had 
meetings with them. [sentence as heard] We discussed the 
situation together, and then during these four years, we have 
exchanged on a wide variety of very sensitive issues. When our 
own teams could not agree, we sat down together and exchanged 
views. I took him into confidence about some of the problems 
that I had. He took me in confidence about the problems that he 
had, and we worked as a team behind the scenes, [applause] and 
we were able to keep together at one time 26 political parties 
with different backgrounds, pulling in different directions. 
  Today is the result of that other force in our country -- 
that of persuasion, that of discussing, that of dialogue, that 
of love and loyalty to our common fatherland. Now in the days 
to come, this is the force on which we are going to rely. We 
are still going to have many problems because when Mr. de Klerk 
talks about a democracy sometimes he doesn't mean the same thing 
which I understand about democracy. [laughter] And when our own 
people, when we talk about a government of national unity, which 
now must fight for reconciliation, for nation building, they 
don't understand the same thing which he understands. Sometimes 
we don't understand the same thing which I understand. 
[laughter] So the government of national unity has to face all 
these problems. But I have no doubt that we have men and women 
in this country from all sections of the population who will 
rise to the challenge. 
  There are many Americans here. Perhaps let me repeat what I 
have said in their absence, because this comes from an American 
who is alive today. And those who have been with me in the 
meetings I have addressed must plug their ears because they will 
be bored to hear this again. Some American has said a person 
who does what all others can do, is an ordinary person. A 
person who does what no other person can do, is exceptional. 
But a person who does what no other person has ever done, is a 
national asset, is a genius, is an institution. 
  South Africa today wants men and women who strive to do what 
no other person has done. We require this for our country. It 
is your wish -- everyone of you -- that when your last days on 
earth come, we should be able to say: Here lies the man or 
woman who has done his or her duty on earth; and if you strive 
to do what no other person has done, we will be able to say: 
Here lies a person who did his duty on earth. I thank you.

<F P=106> [By Guy Rogers and Neil Lewis] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- Political heavyweights -- 
dictators past and present, guerrilla chiefs and the wealthy 
governors of Western coffers -- streamed into Jan Smuts airport 
from across the globe on Monday to attend Tuesday's [10 May] 
presidential inaugration of Nelson Mandela and to sing the 
praises of democracy. United States Vice-President Al Gore, 
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Palestinian Liberation 
Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Tanzanian founding 
President Julius Nyerere and more than 80 other leaders arrived 
to heap praise on South Africa and its people. 
  Heading a 65-strong U.S. delegation, the most senior to 
visit 
South Africa, Mr Gore said the moment was historic not only for 
South Africa but for all mankind. The inauguration of African 
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela marked a transition in 
the history of the world, he said. The U.S. civil rights 
movement and the struggle for democracy in South Africa were 
historically intertwined with both countries sharing the spirit 
of the fight for full democracy. "And so the people of the 
United States rejoice with the people of South Africa. We look 
forward towards starting a new and more vigorous relationship. 
We see the inauguration tomorrow (Tuesday) of Mr Mandela as the 
beginning of a partnership between our two countries." Included 
in the us delegation was first lady Hilary Clinton, Mr Gore's 
wife Tipper, the Rev Jesse Jackson and U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown. 
  On his arrival, Mr Hurd said there has been a huge upsurge 
in 
British business interest in South Africa. He said he was in 
the country to show Britain's support for a new South Africa and 
was going directly from the airport to visit British-aided 
projects in the East Rand townships. 
  Croatian Prime Minister Mr Nikica Valentic said South Africa 
had shown it was possible to satisfy diverse interests in a 
positive way. "We are a country that has emerged from war. The 
message (from South Africa) is political solutions have to be 
sought by peaceful means," he said. 
  Former British prime minister Lord James Callaghan said 
South 
Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he 
had a message for this country, Lord Callaghan said: "South 
Africa is going to work out its own destiny." 
  Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the struggle 
against apartheid had few parallels in modern history. "We are 
confident that under Mr Mandela's sagacious leadership the scars 
of the past will soon heal and the goal of peace and development 
will be achieved." 
  The diminutive Mr Arafat, wearing his traditional black and 
white keffiyeh, said he brought greetings from the Palestinian 
people "and best wishes for my brother and friend President 
Mandela...and Mr (F W) de Klerk". He was greeted by ANC 
representative Stanley Mabisela who held the PLO leader's hand 
as the large delegation strode into the airport building. 
  Mr Nyerere, once a crusader against colonialism and a 
long-time enemy of Pretoria, said he had always wanted to come 
to a free South Africa. "I never believed it would come. But 
here it is." 
  Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman, who was asked if 
his country would be investing in South Africa, said Bangladesh 
had no money to invest "but we will share our knowledge". 
  On his arrival, Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen praised 
the demise of apartheid as "a victory for humanity" and pledged 
R375 million [rand] in aid for South Africa's transition. He 
said he hoped the two countries would exchange "experiences", 
expecially in the labour market, and he extended a formal 
invitation to Mr Mandela to visit Denmark. The Danish national 
soccer team, European champions in 1992, were scheduled to visit 
South Africa in 1995, Mr Rasmussen announced. "This is a most 
happy moment in Danish international politics. (It) is the fall 
of the Berlin Wall...in human terms...a victory for humanity." 
  From Syria to the Bahamas, Italy, Slovakia, Georgia, Malta, 
Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania they continued to 
pour into Jan Smuts from dawn and into the night. Other 
notables included the Irish President Mary Robinson, Greek King 
Constantine and Mr Abdul Rahman Taib who is the Industry 
Minister of Brunei, the richest country per capita in the world. 
Also among them were European Union Chairman T Pangalos, 
Portuguese president Dr Mario Soares, French first lady 
Danniella Mitterand, Spanish heir apparent Prince Asturias and 
Finland President Mr Martii Ahtisaari [name and title as 
received] who is credited with brokering Namibian independence. 
The presidents of Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, as 
well as Lesotho King Letsie III, were due to arrive later in the 
night. 
  The prize for the biggest present went to the Philippines -- 
a four-foot square box in colourful wrapping paper and ribbon 
reportedly containing shoes for Mr Mandela. 
  By 6PM there was still no news of the expected appearance of 
Libyan Chief Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
A Cuban aircraft arrived early on Monday but apparently it was 
carrying only cigars. 
  On his arrival, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said: 
"Africa has been decolonised and is in the process of 
democratisation -- that is the challenge."

  [Text] Pretoria May 9 SAPA -- Israeli President Ezer 
Weizman and Palestine Liberation Organisation Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat met on South African soil on Monday when they paid a 
courtesy visit to President-elect Nelson Mandela. They are in 
the country for Mr Mandela's inauguration in Pretoria on 
Tuesday. The three men posed for a photograph at the presidency 
in Pretoria where they held talks. Mr Weizman presented Mr 
Mandela with a silver-plated scripture, called a Tanach in 
Hebrew. 
  Outside at an impromptu press conference, Mr Weizman said Mr 
Mandela had promised him and Mr 'Arafat he would visit their 
countries [as received]. Mr Arafat said they had had "very 
important discussions". 
  Mr Weizman and Mr 'Arafat were among a string of dignitaries 
who met Mr Mandela on Monday. British foreign secretary douglas 
hurd was the first. After his talks with Mr Mandela, Mr Hurd 
said the president-elect was full of plans and ideas for the 
future. He said he had told Mr Mandela Britain was anxious and 
keen to provide assets or experience that could be useful to 
South Africa. 
  Other dignitaries to visit Mr Mandela were former Australian 
prime ministers Mr Bob Hawke and Mr Malcolm Fraser. 
  Scheduled to visit Mr Mandela on Monday night were 
representatives of a selected Commonwealth group, including 
Canadian deputy prime minister Ms Sheila Copps, Malaysian 
minister of foreign affairs Mr Abdullah bin Haji Ahmad Badawi, 
Singaporean minister of finance Dr Richard Hu and Sri Lankan 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr A C S Hameed.

President Sam Nujoma, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, 
Basotho King Letsie III and Swazi King Mswati III. 
  Most leaders and heads-of-state presented mr mandela with 
gifts. 
  The South African Communications Service said in a statement 
on Monday night King Constantine of Greece was in South Africa 
in his private capacity, and not to represent the Hellenic 
Republic of Greece. "Neither is he a member of the Greek 
delegation attending the inauguration of President Mandela, 
despite press reports to the contrary," the statement said.

  [Text] Nelson Mandela will officially be sworn in as South 
African president tomorrow. A number of international figures 
are in Cape Town [as heard] to attend the swearing in of South 
Africa's first black president. Angolan President Jose Eduardo 
dos Santos is one such figure, and he has already arrived in 
South Africa for that purpose. As he was about to leave the 
Angolan capital today, the Angolan head of state noted that 
Mandela's victory was a victory for Africa. 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] It is a great victory for the 
people of South Africa, the African National Congress, and 
President Nelson Mandela in particular. However, it is also a 
victory for the whole of Africa. The OAU and all African 
political forces have now implemented their basic program: We 
have fully liberated Africa. Now, we are involved in a new 
stage, that of reconstruction and development. [end recording] 
  When he arrived in South Africa, President dos Santos noted 
that Angola had shown solidarity with the Angolan people. 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] We regard these as historic 
times. This is a new and democratic South Africa, and we are 
happy that we helped in some way to ensure that this day would 
come sooner, rather than later, so that the South African 
people's suffering would be over. Now, we think that the South 
African people must also show solidarity with the Angolan 
people. We made sacrifices and we fought in the same trenches 
to achieve our common goals. Angola is still at war, though, so 
we hope that South Africa will now also contribute in whatever 
way it can to ensure that the suffering of the Angolan people 
will be over soon. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Joe Modise by Leslie </F>
Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program; place not given -- live or 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening and welcome to Monday 
night's "Newsline." Tonight we give you the first ever 
interview with the minister of national defense, Mr. Joe Modise. 
Mr. Modise, good evening and welcome, and let's congratulate 
you on being appointed national defense minister of the new 
South Africa. 
  [Modise] Thank you. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, what do you regard as priorities? 
What is important to you as defense minister? 
  [Modise] Your question is a loaded question. From the side 
of defense, naturally, the priority is to put these armies 
together. As you know we had the former South African Defense 
Force [SADF]; we had Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], 
APLA [Azanian People's Liberation Army]; we also had the 
Transkei Defense Force and Bophuthatswana Defense Force and the 
Ciskei Defense Force. All those forces on 27 April became the 
South African National Defense Force. Now we are faced with the 
task of preparing them. In other words, they've got to undergo 
training -- in fact all of them -- so that we've got one uniform 
form of training. For the process, we have requested the 
British in particular to come and assist us in preparing these 
forces, and also in taking part in the adjudication especially 
when infiltration, I mean when integration begins to take place, 
so that we don't have a lot of wrangling. So basically the 
starting point would be to prepare all these forces so that the 
level of training is more or less the same. 
  [Mashokwe] Putting together these forces from different 
backgrounds, in a way from different thinking, and former 
enemies becoming compatriots or colleagues in the army -- is it 
doable, let me use that word? 
  [Modise] It is doable, but it's not an easy task. It's a 
mammoth task, because here you are not just dealing with 
ordinary training; you are also changing attitudes. It has been 
done in Zimbabwe; it's done in Namibia; there is no reason why 
South Africa shouldn't do it. And what I saw today, in this 
parliament, is a clear indication that our people are now on the 
doorstep of progress. We are on the threshold of building a 
nation, and I am very confident that that South African nation 
is going to be built. Unlike the factions that we had in the 
past, if we can build a nation, there is no reason why we 
shouldn't put these different forces together and build a truly 
national defense force. 
  [Mashokwe] Apparently we had this failed attempt at putting 
together the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF], and many cynics 
look at that and say: Will we be able to put together a national 
defense force if we failed at that level? 
  [Modise] You must not forget that the Peacekeeping Force 
never had a chance. We had planned to put it together, train it 
for nine months. It was done in eight weeks. The training was 
completely inadequate. Time was too short, and what is more, 
the Peacekeeping Force was opposed long before its inception. 
The idea was opposed. It had a lot of enemies from within and 
from without. I've never seen a force that was criticized like 
the Peacekeeping Force. So, in other words, it was never given 
a chance. I don't think that attitude is going to prevail with 
the building of the new South African National Defense Force, 
and we are going to give ourselves time. We don't see 
integration as an overnight affair. We look at it as a process. 
We are going to start preparing our men now. We are going to 
put them through the necessary paces, until we feel that they 
are ready to be put together, because that's the only way in 
which we are going to have a legitimate force. The SADF cannot 
be transformed into the South African National Defense Force. 
It won't be accepted by the people. It will still remain an 
illegitimate force. To legitimize it we've got to bring in all 
these others, and we've got to empower them. They come from a 
deprived community. They never had the opportunities that their 
counterparts have. We've got to work hard and get them also to 
be on this, on par with the others, so that the integration also 
should be seen as being fair, and if the SADF has got black 
groups that were commanded, that fought wars in Angola and 
everywhere else, what would be wrong with these black troops 
that are coming into the new National Defense Force? 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, as I listen to you talk, I remember 
that in days gone by you were almost regarded as chief 
terrorist. Now you are chief of the defense force. Tell me 
about that transformation in your heart, in your mind, in your 
being? 
  [Modise] Well, I was asked this morning, this evening too, 
how do I feel? I said somewhat strange. It does. The 
surroundings are strange. Parliament, do you know that it was 
my first time to enter parliament yesterday? I've never seen it 
from inside. I've always seen it from outside as I'm passing 
here. One had that feeling, but let me say it's a challenge and 
I'm confident that we are going to succeed in building this new 
nation. I said to you earlier on, we are on the threshold of 
building a nation in this country. We are moving away from the 
old black, brown, white factions that we had here. We are 
building one solid nation, and like I said earlier on, that I am 
very confident. What I saw here today, over the past few days 
-- in fact from the elections -- I've always been confident; 
I've always been optimistic. [sentence as heard] But from the 
elections I became even more optimistic that we are going to 
build a prosperous country, and our people are going to be 
united. And, you ask me how do I feel? That's the feeling I 
have. I have the feeling of being part of a great nation, and 
let me say, from my side as minister, with my [word indistinct] 
I'm going to put it together. We will also do our best to do our 
small part to make sure that this country becomes prosperous and 
its people are well protected. 
  [Mashokwe] In defense the important matter now when you 
could say the scenario, the political scenario, the cold war is 
over, we no more have enemies, we don't have the kind of 
situations that prevailed in the old days of apartheid when we 
had to be guarding all the borders -- should we be giving you 
more money than was the budget for the last year? Should we use 
that money elsewhere for instance? 
  [Modise] You've got to look after your forces. There's no 
such thing as people not having enemies. Perhaps they don't 
appear now because we have a formidable force here. If this 
force disappears and we become defenseless, you'll be surprised 
how many enemies are going to mushroom. Look at Switzerland -- 
they've always been neutral, they've never fought a war, but I 
can remember, I mean from Western history, that they are armed 
to the teeth. You ask yourselves: Why are they spending so much 
money? They've just bought five Phantoms from the United States 
-- I mean, F-18's from the United States. You ask yourself why 
are they arming to the teeth when they are a neutral country? 
They've always been neutral. Even when people negotiate peace, 
we go to Geneva. Peaceful people. Why are they defending 
themselves? 
  [Mashokwe] You are saying the defense budget must not be cut 
down. When I listen to other politicians from your organization 
they say: We'll cut on defense; we'll use that money for 
reconstruction and development. Is there not conflict of 
interests here? 
  [Modise] No, no I don't think you must misunderstand me. 
Naturally, our priority as a nation is to better the lives of 
our people. The development program is a very important 
program. We've got to save where we can, even in defense. We 
are not going to modernize. It's true our country has been 
isolated for a very long time. It couldn't buy the type of 
equipment that they would want to buy. But we've got to 
maintain what we have. We can't take these aeroplanes now and 
throw them into the scrap yard. They need to be serviced. We 
need to buy spare parts for them, but of course the outlook will 
always toward saving a little bit from defense, saving from all 
over, enabling the government to continue with its development 
program. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to put myself in the boots of minister 
of defense. You have all these newcomers -- MK, APLA, and 
everybody else who would like to be now a member of the National 
Defense Force. You obviously need a bigger budget. But now the 
question is, what's more important? Those who are coming in to 
defend the country? Are you prepared to take a cut in the 
defense budget? What do you think is important? I know you 
might have a prejudiced answer, but it is important? 
  [Modise] I think there will be a reduction in spending on 
new 
equipment. We can't take these men and throw them into the 
streets. They've got to come in, and naturally after preparing 
them, there will be rationalization, and after rationalization 
we need to find other alternatives for them. I was asked by the 
radio people as to what's going to happen to them? I've been 
highly impressed with the Taiwanese approach. They've got what 
they call a Veteran's Association. The men who went to Taiwan 
under Chiang Kai-shek when they got there, when they were now 
being rationalized with Chiang Kai-shek, when they were half a 
million men, and he ended up with 100,000 men -- the other 
400,000 weren't in it -- and their conditions were worse than 
ours. Those men were assisted by the government, given 
training, started working with their hands, developed. Today, 
the biggest engineering companies today belong to the ex-service 
association. I don't say we'll equal the Taiwanese, but I think 
that as soon as these men -- and we are working in the direction 
of preparing, getting an organization which will absorb them -- 
and we'll then train them to acquire little skills and some 
will, those who have got the ability to go to universities will 
be given that opportunity, and the government will assist where 
it can. But eventually we are going to assist these people to 
begin to stand on their own feet, give them a little bit of 
money once they have acquired skills to start working on their 
own, and we will be preparing them to enter civilian life. We 
think this method of approaching this problem will also go a 
long way to assist us. 
  [Mashokwe] If one who was a captain, or holding a rank 
within 
the MK faction is given some training, will it be equal to a 
rank of captain within the defense force? How are you going to 
integrate that [words indistinct]? 
  [Modise] I said to you that we had irregular training, some 
of our men. Of course others had regular training. Those who 
did not have regular training, and they had irregular training, 
they will be given a chance, they will be trained, and if the 
man then was a captain, then we will train him as a captain, 
whether it takes a year or two years, three years to prepare 
him. This is a man who has commanded, a man who fought against 
formidable regular forces, so we will empower him to become a 
proper captain. 
  [Mashokwe] When you look back with hindsight, Mr. Modise, 
many people who have lost their lives during the onslaught, the 
attacks that you were waging as commander out there, are you 
ever sorry that you did it? 
  [Modise] If I found myself in a similar situation, I would 
do 
it all over again. I do regret the lives that have been lost. 
I think apartheid oppression in this country was wrong. It was 
unnecessary for this country to have lost so many dear ones. 
But if I was placed in the same position, I would repeat it all 
over again. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Modise, on that note thanks for your time and 
thanks for talking to us. 
  [Modise] You are welcome. 
  [Mashokwe] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Jovial Rantao] </F>
  [Excerpt] The National Party [NP] intends to attempt to 
wrest control of the foreign affairs and defence portfolios from 
the ANC, reliable sources have informed THE STAR. The NP wants 
its own men in the new Cabinet in the places of Alfred Nzo and 
former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military 
wing] commander Joe Modise, who were appointed to those 
Ministries by the ANC on Friday [6 May]. 
  THE STAR's sources said De Klerk wanted to retain both Pik 
Botha and Kobie Coetsee in two of the most powerful positions in 
the Cabinet. A confrontation between the outgoing and future 
governments is expected over the posts. 
  However, ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said as far as his 
organisation was concerned, the Cabinet issue had not reached 
finality and Cabinet positions would, in the spirit of the 
government of national unity and reconstruction, be negotiated 
with the NP, the Inkatha Freedom Party and other political 
players. NP sources told THE STAR that Roelf Meyer, the 
Government's chief negotiator in the multiparty negotiations 
would retain his Constitutional Development Ministry. 
  The other four NP men tipped to fill Cabinet seats are 
Public 
Enterprise Minister Dawie de Villiers and Leon Wessels, the 
current Minister of Manpower. 
  Derek Keys would retain his finance portfolio, so would Abe 
Williams retain sports. 
  In the three NP Deputy Ministers' posts, De Klerk is said to 
be willing to reward some up and coming black, coloured and 
white politicians. The posts could either go to David 
Chuenyane, who was the highest black on the party election list; 
Sheila Camerer, outgoing Deputy Minister of Justice; Chris 
Fismer, a Deputy Minister in the State President's office, Jac 
Rabie, former Minister of Population Development and Bhadra 
Ranchod, the current Minister of Tourism. 
  The Inkatha Freedom party's three seats would be filled by 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Joe Matthews and Dr. Ben Ngubane, THE STAR 
learnt last night. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Challenge Facing Mr. Mandela"] </F>
  [Text] Now that Mr. Mandela is to be the president of the 
country following his party's victory in the election, we wish 
to convey our congratulations on this historic feat. The matter 
does not end here, however, as the job comes with rather 
difficult challenges. 
  The first challenge is that, though he is the leader of a 
party that won a landslide victory, he must now be able to rise 
above partisanship and be the leader of the entire nation. We 
regard this as a challenge because, on many occasions in the 
past, close party aides have given him bad advice that has led 
him into error, when he on his own had rightly discerned the 
truth of the matter. 
  The second challenge is to succeed in fostering 
reconciliation and encouraging a spirit of peace in the entire 
nation. He has identified this as a goal, and we with him 
success. We do not say this lightly, but in earnest, because we 
comprehend the difficulty of brokering peace between contending 
sides. 
  The third challenge is to succeed in delivering on the 
promises made to the electorate by his party. There are many 
people who voted for the ANC because it promised them houses, 
work, and other such things. A great many people think that as 
soon as he is installed, they will have houses and jobs the very 
next day, but no, that is not how it will be. 
  The greatest challenge, and we do not know how he will 
achieve it, is that of bringing about peace and reconciliation 
between himself, as Mandela the individual, and the Royal House 
of KwaZulu and the Zulu nation as a whole. Perhaps there are 
not too many breaches he himself can be held accountable for, 
but there was most certainly much harm done by zealots in his 
party, and their acts have not left Mandela untainted because -- 
as the saying goes in Zulu -- the master is responsible for what 
his dog does. 
  We do, however, trust that if he is given the chance to be a 
leader with authority he will succeed, because to our knowledge 
he is a man with humanity and insight, who, if allowed to use 
his own judgment, and the attributes given him by God Almighty, 
will succeed in meeting all challenges.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly Speaker Dr. Frene Ginwala </F>
by correspondent Conrad Burke in the Cape Town studio -- 
recorded.] 
  [Text] [Burke] In the studio, Dr. Frene Ginwala, speaker of 
parliament, a pivotal position. How are you going to approach 
this? 
  [Ginwala] I don't think I have a ready-made formula, partly 
adjust slowly, understand what's involved, but also move in the 
direction of processes that are already in place in the country 
and try and make sure that parliament moves along with those. 
  [Burke] Breaking new ground, though? People who have seen 
parliament for many years saw new ground broken down. 
  [Ginwala] It must break new ground because parliament has 
got 
to be representative of the changes; it's got to lead them; it's 
got to reflect them. So it will break new ground. There is a 
tradition in this country which came out of your British 
Parliament, came out of a particular South African experience. 
Now parliament has to reflect, and as I said before, drive the 
new South Africa -- a democratic experience, an African 
experience. 
  For me one of the most fulfilling moments of today was 
watching the members of parliament being sworn in, and I 
happened to be sitting in a way which I could see their faces. 
Some of them I knew. But when you looked at them, they 
reflected South Africa, and it was really marvelous. It was 
marvelous to watch. 
  [Burke] Now to large extent, parliament does use precedents 
set by previous parliaments. To what extent will you be using 
precedents set by the old parliament? 
  [Ginwala] When we really have to look at precedents, where 
they come from, what their purpose is. [sentence as heard] We 
do need to move in directions that will be new, but you don't 
make changes for the sake of change. And I think in each case 
one will have to look at it, the members will have to look at it 
because it's got to be a parliament in which they can function, 
in which they are comfortable. If there is a rule which has no 
meaning for them, which comes out of a tradition which they know 
nothing about, and which serves no useful purpose, we will have 
to change that. I think that's the way we need to approach any 
changes we make. 
  [Burke] So you're looking at flexibility? 
  [Ginwala] Yes. 
  [Burke] With discipline? 
  [Ginwala] I think discipline is going to be important. 
Hopefully one would not need to exercise it because one of the 
things about the present process is the way people have worked 
together over the last two years. And one hopes that same sort 
of atmosphere will continue in parliament. But parliament 
should not be seen as a rubber stamp. It's got to be creative; 
it's got to make an input. It's not there simply to say aye to 
every piece of legislation. It's got to look at that and add to 
it. So you got to find a mixture of all of that. 
  [Burke] How do you encourage debate? 
  [Ginwala] Well, I have a feeling with the composition of 
this 
parliament one would not need to encourage it. I think we have 
people who have experience in articulating, whether it is a 
political party conference or in parliament, whether it has been 
out of the past debates that have happened or the debates that 
happened within the mass democratic movement, that happened 
within political parties within the liberation struggle; and all 
of that will feed in -- I hope -- to a new vigorous democratic 
debate, where ideas will [pauses].... There will be a thrust of 
new ideas. There will be challenges. That's what we need to 
aim for. How one would encourage it if it doesn't happen, I 
honestly don't know, but I feel they won't need encouraging 
  [Burke] Have you had experience? Have you seen other 
parliamentary systems in operation? 
  [Ginwala] I have seen them, but I haven't studied them. I 
mean I lived in exile for many years, so I have seen how they 
function. I had an interest because I am interested in politics, 
but never dreaming that I would be speaker of a democratic South 
African parliament. 
  [Burke] How does the British or the American system strike 
you? 
  [Ginwala] There are some things -- both of them are moving 
in 
particular directions which personally I would want us to move 
in terms of greater openness, greater transparency, a greater 
engagement with the public. How you would do that here -- again 
I think it's too early for me to say. I would need time to look 
at it. Members themselves will have to decide how they want 
parliament to function. I think that's for me the crucial 
thing. They must set the pace. They must make the decisions. 
They've got to feel that they can work there, and that they can 
engage with the public through parliament. 
  [Burke] Women's emancipation has been something very close 
to 
your heart. How do you see your appointment? A milestone 
perhaps on the road? 
  [Ginwala] It's a very important step, it's a milestone. I 
think it was very encouraging for women that this could happen. 
I know from the responses that rang out in parliament -- cries 
of malibongwe [let it be thanked] -- were reflective of that. 
But I must admit that today was for me a triumph for democracy. 
Of course that should encompass women. 
  [Burke] Just give us a glimpse, a little glimpse of the 
parliamentary program for the rest of the year. 
  [Ginwala] I believe the Senate, well this goes beyond the 
House of Assembly, the Senate is due to meet on the 20th, and 
the first step that we have to do is the houses have to 
constitute themselves, which is what we did today with the 
National Assembly. It elected a speaker. Similarly the Senate 
will have to meet and constitute itself, elect its officials. 
Then the next step will be -- I think it's on the 23d, the 
morning of the 23d, when the Constituent Assembly, the body that 
will write the new constitution, will constitute itself and 
elect its officials, and immediately later that day on the 23d 
the president will come again to today's National Assembly, and 
will give his address to Parliament, set the program for the 
year. We will have a debate at that point for three days. 
Thereafter there is a brief adjournment. We come back in early 
June for the first reading of the budget -- for a few days. And 
then effectively the major sessions of parliament will be 
adjourned till about early August. 
  Of course as the new government puts out legislation, select 
committees will be meeting to process the legislation. 
  [Burke] Well, in your new term, we wish you well. 
  [Ginwala] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with General Constand Viljoen, leader </F>
of the Freedom Front, by reporter Jan Taljaard "this week"; 
place not given] 
  [Text] Peaceful co-existence between the Afrikaner and 
other South Africans and a constitutional solution for the 
Afrikaner are the immediate objectives Freedom Front [FF] leader 
General Constand Viljoen is setting for himself in a government 
of national unity. 
  In an interview this week Viljoen shed some light on how he 
views the future and how he plans to further the cause of what 
he calls "Afrikaner self-determination". 
  A prerequisite will be to win the confidence of the new 
rulers and to convince them that the FF is sincere in its desire 
for a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] and peace. 
  "The concept of self-determination is new to Nelson Mandela. 
  To bring the true meaning of this concept home, there must 
be peace and there must be straight talking. Mandela must have 
full confidence in the leadership of the Afrikaner people or 
else it will not work," he says. 
  On how he plans to sell the volkstaat to an ANC-dominated 
government of national unity, Viljoen said the issue should not 
be forced. 
  "We will have to convince Mandela that self-determination is 
the real desire of the Afrikaner. When I decided to opt for the 
peaceful way it was because I knew that the hostilities 
generated by war will take too long to heal," he says. 
  He is adamant a volkstaat could "easily" have been taken by 
force, but that this course of action would have caused 
divisions almost impossible to heal. 
  The achievement of a volkstaat by peaceful means will 
necessarily take time, he said, emphasising that the concept of 
a future volkstaat will have to revolve around political 
independence and economical interdependence. 
  "We do not want to repeat the black homelands in a white 
homeland. They were never economically viable." 
  To achieve Afrikaner dominance in a volkstaat, Viljoen 
envisages a gradual resettlement programme that may take from 20 
to 25 years. 
  In this regard he likes to mention the example of the state 
of Israel that started out with about 650,000 settlers in 1948. 
  "But at the same time we would not like to withdraw the 
Afrikaner out of the South African community." 
  Viljoen says the volkstaat must become an Israel to 
Afrikaners living outside its borders. Even if they do not live 
there they can always look to it as the home of Afrikaner 
nationalism. 
  But if it is all about perceptions can't the Afrikaner 
preserve his heritage without a volkstaat? "No, it must be 
real," says Viljoen. 
  Viljoen shies away from the issue of whether blacks will be 
accorded citizenship in a volkstaat. "That remains the subject 
of negotiations and there are many possibilities," he says. 
  "One of these may be to entrench 25 percent of the seats in 
a 
national assembly for black representatives." 
  Viljoen won't be drawn on a possible position for himself in 
a new government. "I will only talk about it when the offer is 
actually made to me," he says. 
  But what if, for instance, he is offered the position of 
defence minister? If such a position can further the cause of 
peace in which the interests of the Afrikaner can be pursued, he 
will definitely consider it, he says. 
  He says it will take a minimum of five years before a new 
and 
integrated defence force can be properly established. In the 
meantime the bulk of the existing armed forces still lies in the 
commando and citizen forces. 
  "The armed forces will be of great importance to stabilise 
the situation during the next five years," he says. "And if I 
can play a role in ensuring that, I will do it."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 9 SAPA -- The three National 
Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] battalions deployed on the East Rand 
will be withdrawn Tuesday (tomorrow) and will return to their 
Bloemfontein base. The withdrawal was on the instructions of 
the Transitional Executive Council, NPKF spokesman Col Connie 
van Rensburg said on Monday, and would be completed by Saturday 
May 14. 
  "Once all the troops are regrouped at the De Brugge base, 
retraining will start and will continue until the future of the 
force is decided upon by the government of national unity," said 
Col van Rensburg. 
  The NPKF, made up of former liberation army guerrillas, SADF 
[South African Defense Force] and homeland defence force troops, 
and members of the SA Police, has been dogged by controversy 
since its inception. This included reports of drunkenness, 
mutinous behaviour, and poor training, culminating in the 
force's inability to keep the peace in war-torn East Rand 
townships.

<F P=106> [By Peter de Ionno] </F>
  [Text] The SA Navy -- long neglected "Cinderella" of the 
defence force -- has fired the first shots in a fight for 
survival. It is proposing a R1.2-billion [rand] contract to 
build four deep- water patrol ships. 
  But this presents a dilemma for the ANC-led 
government--whose 
leaders have said funds from the R9.2-billion defence budget 
will be used to fund the ANC's R39-billion reconstruction plan. 
  President-elect Nelson Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki 
have voiced their approval of this. 
  Defence experts say an efficient navy is essential to 
protect 
South Africa's marine interests. Also, they say the SA Navy 
needs development to end the country's "psychosis of isolation" 
-- and define its role as a regional power. 
  New Defence Minister Joe Modise will be pressured to make 
cuts to keep his budget within 2.6 percent of the GDP--which the 
International Monetary Fund says is a prerequisite for the 
granting of loans for social improvements. 
  Last week invitations for proposals to build the vessels -- 
corvettes equipped with anti-submarine helicopters -- were 
issued through Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa] 
to shipyards in Britain, Denmark, France and Spain. This week, 
Armscor refused to comment on the invitations, which followed a 
two-year study of 42 designs offered by 17 countries. 
  Mr Modise, former Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; 
ANC 
military wing--MK] commander, will be torn between loyalty to 
this programme and a lobby pushing for a status quo in defence 
spending. He leads a small but influential band of "hawks" in 
the military section of the ANC sympathetic to the defence lobby. 
  The arms industry's attempts to woo Mr Modise included a 
visit in December by him and Armscor chief executive Tielman de 
Waal to British arms manufacturers at the invitation of the 
British Ministry of Defence's sales division. 
  Mr Modise's problems will be compounded by an upward trend 
in 
defence costs -- even without capital investment. The 
integration of 35,000 MK guerrillas and former TBVC [Transkei, 
Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] soldiers into the National 
Defence Force threatens to add a R3.5-billion burden to the 
budget over the next three years. Senior officers want this to 
be paid for from funds additional to the defence budget. 
  Against this background, the Navy's bid to stay afloat by 
modernising its ageing fleet seems hopeless. In addition to the 
corvettes, it says it needs at least four 2,000-ton 
multi-purpose "blue water" ships to do its job properly. The SA 
Navy has had its share of the defence budget slashed from 17 to 
eight percent since 1990 -- and faces being downgraded from a 
maritime force to a mere coast guard.

  [Text] The South African Air Force [SAAF] has more Dakotas 
flying for it than almost any other air force. Today one of 
them flew into Britain closing a gap between the SAAF and 
Britain's Royal Air Force, which has existed for more than 30 
years. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Cliff Saunders in 
Cambridge] 
They wanted an old deck, and the South African Air Force gave 
them one. In its colorful career in England, north Africa and 
South Africa, it has clocked 14,400 hours. It flew another 
12,000 kilometers through Africa to reach Cambridge. The 
captain, Lieutenant Colonel Gawie Steenkamp, still has faith in 
the aircraft. 
  [Steenkamp in Afrikaans] I think it's still in a condition 
to 
see another 50 years. 
  [Saunders] Handing over the relevant documents for the 
Dakota 
was chief of the Air Force, Lieutenant General James Kriel. He 
emphasized the excellent contact that had been made by the 
plane's crew on route and was pleased about the event. 
  [Kriel] In a historical sense, this flight can be seen as 
the 
beginning of normalizing relations with other forces after a 
long, sad period of isolation. 
  [Saunders] We spoke to the chairman of Airborne Initiative, 
Mr. Alan Curtis. 
  [Curtis] On November the seventh last year I got a telephone 
call, a magic telephone call, which said: We are going to give 
you a Dakota, and what's more we are going to give you all the 
spares to go with it. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Country's Leaders Now `On Trial' -- Johannesburg THE STAR in 
English on 10 May in a page-10 editorial says the unanimous 
election by the National Assembly of Nelson Mandela as state 
president "signals acceptance of his leadership by his 
adversaries in the election." The unanimous election of 
provincial premiers is "similarly propitious, for South Africa 
and for Mandela's dream of building a unifying sense of national 
identity amid cultural diversity." Also, the inclusion of 
Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and two 
IFP leaders in the Cabinet is a manifestly positive development. 
It means the Government of National Unity will be one in 
substance as well as in name. The IFP presence in the Cabinet 
should serve as inspiration to the provincial government in 
KwaZulu/Natal and help bring an end to the fratricide which has 
torn that province asunder for the past decade. The foundations 
have been laid for a new South Africa by the men and women who 
drafted the new constitution and by the generosity and sagacity 
displayed by political leaders since the election." Now there 
must be "sustained follow-through, in the form of economic 
growth, upliftment of the poor -- most of whom were victims of 
past racial oppression -- and steadfast commitment to the broad 
national interest rather than party-political agendas. South 
Africa's leaders are on trial." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Government Appointments `To Repay' Those Who Helped Them -- 
The new government now faces the task "to repay those who helped 
in setting them up," says a page 14 editorial in Johannesburg 
SOWETAN in English on 10 May. "There may be doubts about Mr 
Alfred Nzo's appointment as Minister of Foreign Affairs but we 
think it was a good choice. It is true that, as an honourable 
man, Mr Mandela does not forget old friends." "The Minister of 
Finance perhaps needs the skills in such matters of a man like 
Mr Derek Keyes. But even Keyes might find himself in an 
uncomfortable position if he insists on strict financial 
disciplines to a government that will be forced to concentrate 
on development and reconstruction."

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] has infiltrated four battalions into Huila 
Province to carry out major military operations. General 
Francisco Furtado, commander of the Southern Military Front, has 
said that those forces have been moved from Huambo and are now 
engaging in operations in the north of the province, where the 
military situation has deteriorated since 2 May. Gen. Furtado 
had this to say: 
  [Begin Furtado recording] On the Southern Military Front, 
the 
situation has been deteriorating in the northern part of Huila 
Province over the last few days. Our forces have been coming 
under attack from UNITA troops estimated to total up to four 
battalions. Those forces have come from Huambo and areas north 
of Caconda, and they have been carrying out those operations 
since 2 May. Fighting is continuing in the area of Quilengues. 
This has necessitated major efforts by our forces to defend the 
people in the area. The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, have also 
been efficiently annihilating those UNITA forces that have 
attacked that position. 
  By 1500, when we contacted the commander in the area, some 
81 
UNITA soldiers had been confirmed killed on the ground and our 
forces had also made three prisoners. The first thing those 
prisoners said was that they had come from Huambo and that their 
mission was to take Quilengues before the government and UNITA 
had signed any accord at the Lusaka peace talks. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Inaugural address by President Nelson Mandela in the </F>
amphitheater at the Union Buildings in Pretoria--live] 
  [Text] Your Majesties, Your Highnesses, distinguished 
guests, comrades, and friends: 
  Today, all of us do, by our presence here, and by our 
celebrations in other parts of our country and the world, confer 
glory and hope to newborn liberty. 
  Out of the experience of an extraordinary human disaster 
that 
lasted too too long, must be born a society of which all 
humanity will be proud. 
  Our daily deeds as ordinary South Africans must produce an 
actual South African reality that will reinforce humanity's 
belief in justice, strengthen its confidence in the nobility of 
the human soul and sustain all our hopes for a glorious life for 
all. 
  All this we owe both to ourselves and to the peoples of the 
world who are so well represented here today. 
  To my compatriots, I have no hesitation in saying that each 
one of us is as intimately attached to the soil of this 
beautiful country as are the famous jacaranda trees of Pretoria 
and the mimosa trees of the bushveld. 
  Each time one of us touches the soil of this land, we feel a 
sense of personal renewal. The national mood changes as the 
seasons change. 
  We are moved by a sense of joy and exhilaration when the 
grass turns green and the flowers bloom. 
  That spiritual and physical oneness we all share with this 
common homeland explains the depth of the pain we all carried in 
our hearts as we saw our country tear itself apart in a terrible 
conflict, and as we saw it spurned, outlawed and isolated by the 
peoples of the world, precisely because it has become the 
universal base of the pernicious ideology and practice of racism 
and racial oppression. 
  We, the people of South Africa, feel fulfilled that humanity 
has taken us back into its bosom, that we, who were outlaws not 
so long ago, have today been given the rare privilege to be host 
to the nations of the world on our own soil. 
  We thank all our distinguished international guests for 
having come to take possession with the people of our country of 
what is, after all, a common victory for justice, for peace, for 
human dignity. We trust that you will continue to stand by us 
as we tackle the challenges of building peace, prosperity, 
non-sexism, non-racialism and democracy. 
  We deeply appreciate the role that the masses of our people 
and their political mass democratic, religious, women, youth, 
business, traditional and other leaders have played to bring 
about this conclusion. Not least among them is my second deputy 
president, the honourable F.W. de Klerk. 
  We would also like to pay tribute to our security forces, in 
all their ranks, for the distinguished role they have played in 
securing our first democratic elections and the transition to 
democracy, from blood-thirsty forces which still refuse to see 
the light. 
  The time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment 
to bridge the chasms that divide us has come. 
  The time to build is upon us. 
  We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation. We 
pledge ourselves to liberate all our people from the continuing 
bondage of poverty, deprivation, suffering, gender and other 
discrimination. 
  We succeeded to take our last steps to freedom in conditions 
of relative peace. We commit ourselves to the construction of a 
complete, just and lasting peace. 
  We have triumphed in the effort to implant hope in the 
breasts of the millions of our people. We enter into a covenant 
that we shall build the society in which all South Africans, 
both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any 
fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to 
human dignity -- a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the 
world. 
  As a token of its commitment to the renewal of our country, 
the new interim government of national unity will, as a matter 
of urgency, address the issue of amnesty for various categories 
of our people who are currently serving terms of imprisonment. 
  We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this 
country and the rest of the world who sacrificed in many ways 
and surrendered their lives so that we could be free. 
  Their dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward. 
We are both humbled and elevated by the honour and privilege 
that you, the people of South Africa, have bestowed on us, as 
the first president of a united, democratic, non-racial and 
non-sexist South Africa, to lead our country out of the valley 
of darkness. 
  We understand it still that there is no easy road to 
freedom. 
We know it well that none of us acting alone can achieve 
success. 
  We must therefore act together as a united people, for 
national reconciliation, for nation building, for the birth of a 
new world. 
  Let there be justice for all. 
  Let there be peace for all. 
  Let there be work, bread, water and salt for all. 
  Let each know that for each the body, the mind and the soul 
have been freed to fulfill themselves. 
  Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful 
land will again experience the oppression of one by another and 
suffer the indignity of being the skunk of the world. 
  The sun shall never set on so glorious a human achievement! 
  Let freedom reign. 
  God bless Africa! 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly Speaker Dr. Frene Ginwala </F>
by correspondent Leslie Mashokwe in the Cape Town studio -- live 
or recorded] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] Good evening, Dr. Ginwala, and 
congratulations on your appointment as speaker. Exactly what is 
a speaker? 
  [Ginwala] I think there's one role, that you preside over 
the 
National Assembly. It means, in a sense, managing, ensuring its 
objectives are reached. There's been a lot of joking today 
about keeping people in order, but hopefully, if you set up the 
right cooperative atmosphere, you don't need to do too much of 
that, but eventually you might have to do that. You also, in a 
way, give leadership to parliament in terms of the staff, the 
support -- all of that falls within the office of the speaker. 
But I don't know what else, because I've just -- it's not even 
a few hours. I'm learning what else is involved. 
  [Mashokwe] We're told you are the first lady to be speaker 
in 
the world. 
  [Ginwala] No. In South Africa. There are speakers in the 
British Parliament. I think, Austria. A number of other 
countries. Not many, but there are some. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay. For South Africa, it's an important 
occasion, though. What exactly do you think will be your 
problems, presiding over this parliament of different 
backgrounds -- ANC, National Party [NP], and anybody else? 
  [Ginwala] I think that....[pauses] Let me put it as a 
challenge, rather than a problem, because I hope it's not going 
to be a problem. I think the challenge is going to be to bring 
into parliament a democratic tradition. Now people say: But 
surely, that's automatic. It's not. Parliament can be -- in 
many positions it is -- simply a rubber stamp. The cabinet 
decides, and parliamentarians debate and approve legislation. I 
think we need to bring into parliament...it must own...because 
it is the -- and this is what I said when I accepted -- that it 
is the repository of the principles and the values for which 
people have struggled, which have actually driven the kinds of 
changes we've got. [sentence as heard] The natural home for 
that is in a parliament. So if we see parliament in that way, 
then members of parliament have got to be creative; they've got 
to drive the changes that still lie ahead. It doesn't mean that 
they're acting contrary to cabinet, but it does mean a more 
equal relationship, moving in tandem, each contributing, so that 
we speed up the process of change. But even after that, it has 
to be the repository of democracy. 
  [Mashokwe] Looking at a political background, are you going 
to be fair with the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the NP, with 
the ANC background that we know you're from? 
  [Ginwala] I don't think my problem is fairness. To be very 
honest, at a personal level I've been involved in politics. 
Because you're involved in politics, it doesn't mean you're 
involved in adversarial politics. It doesn't mean my beliefs in 
what the ANC stands for have changed. But it does mean that a 
speaker believes in democracy; parliament has got to hear every 
voice. This is again what I said today. It's very, very 
important, because you don't serve democracy by stifling debate. 
So you have to encourage debate. Then the composition of the 
house is not determined by the speaker. It's determined by the 
people of this country, and then they can make the decisions of 
what is the outcome of the debate. But while the debate 
prevails, every voice must be allowed its fullest say. 
  [Mashokwe] I'm trying to understand that, allowed its 
fullest 
say. Is there no temptation, would there be no temptation on 
your part to stifle other voices that are not in your camp, as 
it were? 
  [Ginwala] Well, in terms of my personal record, that would 
not be a problem. I think, like everybody, you sometimes get 
annoyed with someone, and say: Oh, what are they going on about. 
I think obviously, as speaker, you can't show that. But that 
is one thing. But to stifle and to prevent it goes contrary to 
everything I personally have wanted, so it's very difficult to 
say what the future holds, and I've been in this job just a few 
hours. But it would be very wrong to stifle any debate. The 
house itself regulates itself in many ways. It sets rules; it 
sets time schedules. As speaker, my job will be to make sure 
that there's a fair -- that people who want to speak out, ask, 
but within rules, within procedures that everybody has agreed. 
[sentence as heard] That's the process we have to take forward. 
  [Mashokwe] I have to ask you this question now. You're going 
to be presiding over a predominantly male.... 
  [Ginwala, interrupting] Much less so, Leslie, than it was 
two 
days ago. 
  [Mashokwe] Has it changed? 
  [Ginwala] Significantly. Look at it. I don't know the 
number of women, but when you look at the composition of this 
parliament -- and it's not just women. [sentence as heard] I was 
sitting where I could see them, as they were being sworn in, and 
this parliament represents South Africa. There are men and 
women; there are people of all religions, political persuasions; 
there are workers; there are capitalists -- you've got them all. 
That is what it's all about, and it's really marvelous. 
  [Mashokwe] Does it make it more easy for you, if you have 
more women in it, as opposed to presiding over a male-dominated 
parliament? 
  [Ginwala] It makes me feel more comfortable. It makes me 
feel we're reaching the point we need to reach, because it will 
be more democratic, because women's experience will feed into 
the debate, so that when we are talking about laws, we will 
not... [pauses] The lives of half the population in the previous 
parliament were probably more, because blacks were also 
excluded. [sentence as heard] But in terms of the male 
domination, the experience of women will feed into the debate, 
so that.... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] But don't dominate Parliament? 
We're having all this liberation of women.... 
  [Ginwala, interrupting] Why should that be suddenly 
domination? I mean, after all, women are the majority in this 
country, and we're not -- nowhere near -- the majority in this 
parliament. But you might argue, I mean, that by their own 
contribution they might dominate. I think every member's own 
contribution will determine the extent to which they are able to 
shape things. 
  [Mashokwe] You have a background of media, working in the 
media. How is this going to change now that you are Lady 
Speaker? 
  [Ginwala] Well, I don't know whether the background is going 
to have anything to do with it, but my political background 
leads me to believe that parliament has to be open. People have 
got to see what goes on in parliament, and I hope therefore that 
the media will actually cover parliament. But I hope also that 
the media will explain parliament, because there is a lot of 
ritual in parliament which you won't always get rid of. What is 
the difference between a bill and an act? Media, in many ways, 
has to explain that. We will be talking of select committees. 
What are those? So the media have a vital role to play in 
explaining parliament. But from parliament's point of view, 
from the needs of democracy, we need people to feel this is 
their house. We need members of parliament to be aware that all 
of South Africa knows what they are doing, and they are saying, 
and we need the public to know that they have a right to make an 
input into that parliament. We've got to find ways of doing 
that. 
  [Mashokwe] Were you surprised at your appointment, and are 
you ready for it? 
  [Ginwala] No, I'm not ready for it. I was surprised. I was 
honored. I felt very proud, rather intimidated, I'm afraid -- 
regretting that I will not be that active in politics. A 
certain mixture of feelings. 
  [Mashokwe] Dr. Ginwala, on that note, thanks for your time, 
and thanks for talking to us.

<F P=106> [By Serge Arnold] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 10 (AFP) -- Rebels turned up the 
heat on increasingly battered government forces desperately 
struggling to hold back the guerrillas' final offensive on the 
Rwandan capital Tuesday [10 May]. 
  "Kigali will fall within a week," a UN military official 
predicted as rebels pounded a government camp near the airport 
with a heavy barrage of mortar and artillery fire, blowing up an 
ammunition depot. "The army is in increasing disarray and many 
soldiers are deserting," said the official, who requested 
anonymity. [passage omitted] 
  Gunners of the Hutu-led army have relentlessly shelled rebel 
headquarters at the former parliament building since Tuesday. 
Military officials of the United Nations said the government 
forces were "very much on the defensive". Heavy fighting also 
raged around the northwestern town of Ruhengeri and in Bugesera, 
south of the capital, UN spokesman Abdul Kabia said. 
  General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the 400 
remaining UN soldiers in Rwanda, drove across the battle lines 
in an armoured personnel carrier for separate meetings with 
rebel leaders and army officers in a bid to broker a ceasefire 
Tuesday. 
  In Geneva, Canada called on the UN Commission on Human 
Rights 
to hold a special session to discuss developments in Rwanda. 
  Paul Dubois, Canadian acting permanent representative to the 
commission, stated: "We believe effective action to prevent 
further human rights violations must be a central element of the 
overall UN response to the tragedy in Rwanda." 
  UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut said the new rights 
commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso was in Burundi, neighbouring 
Rwanda, on Tuesday, seeking to obtain "impartial" information 
from a wide range of sources, and hoped to go Wednesday to 
Rwanda. A UN relief plane landed in Kigali on Tuesday after 
fighting forced UN officials to turn back an aircraft Monday. 
  Aid agencies have criticised the world body for evacuating 
most of its soldiers after 10 Belgian UN soldiers were killed in 
the initial wave of bloodletting. 
  Pressure is mounting for an international military 
intervention, but the rebels have warned that they will treat 
foreign forces as hostile invaders. 
  Dallaire was to put ceasefire proposals to both sides within 
48 hours. [passage omitted] 
  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees appealed Tuesday for 
56.7 million dollars in aid to assist 860,000 people who have 
fled Rwanda. 
  "We are facing a refugee catastrophe unless enough food, 
clean water, shelter and sanitation are provided to the refugees 
packed into the Banako camp in Tanzania," UNHCR spokesman Ron 
Redmond said. 
  Philippe Gaillard of the International Red Cross said that 
the government's estimate that 2.5 million Rwandans were 
displaced was "not very far off the mark" but that fighting had 
prevented aid workers from reaching many of them. 
  The Catholic aid group Caritas estimates that the bloodbath 
has put two million people at risk of famine in Rwanda and 
Burundi, which shares Rwanda's history of bitter feuds between 
the majority Hutus and the Tutsis, who form about 15 percent of 
the population in both countries.

  [Excerpt] There was some respite in Kigali this afternoon. 
The United Nations' plane that had to make a U-turn yesterday 
finally managed to land early this afternoon at the airport in 
the Rwandan capital. RFI's special correspondent, Jean Helene, 
was on board: 
  [Helene] Heavy weapon fighting, which had been going on 
since 
dawn, stopped early this afternoon, shortly before the arrival 
of the Hercules C-130. The UNAMIR [United Nations Mission in 
Rwanda] said that it had asked the belligerents for a special 
truce in order to be able to evacuate the body of the Ghanaian 
peace-keeper killed on Monday [9 May] night. He was hit by 
shrapnel from a shell that fell on the Amahoro stadium, where 
nearly 3,000 refugees are being guarded by Ghanaian soldiers. 
The UN plane remained on the ground for 20 minutes while UN 
troops were paying homage to their comrade. 
  Exchanges of artillery fire resumed at dusk, albeit less 
heavily, in the suburbs of the capital. According to the news 
that we have, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] troops have not 
made any significant progress in Kigali for the last 48 hours 
despite extremely violent fighting, including near the Kanombe 
camp, where some 4,000 para-commandos are stationed. According 
to some observers, the strategy of the RPF is to bomb the camp 
for several days running before launching a ground attack. More 
to the south, the RPF has gained ground and it can now either 
move up to Kigali or go on eastward toward Gitarama, the 
headquarters of the transitional government. It will certainly 
run into the government forces deployed in the area in order to 
stop its advance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nairobi, 11 May (AFP) -- Artillery duels raged in 
Kigali early Wednesday [11 May] as rebel forces shelled Army 
positions in their drive to oust government troops from the 
Rwandan capital, a United Nations spokesman said. The mainly 
Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front has stepped up its offensive 
against the Hutu-led Army in what UN military sources said was a 
final onslaught to capture Kigali. 
  Artillery shells boomed and machine guns rattled as battles 
flared in different neighbourhoods for about two hours after 
dawn. But the fighting tapered off as the sun rose higher over 
the Kigali hills, spokesman Moctar Gueye told AFP by telephone 
from the capital. 
  UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali meanwhile suggested 
boosting the UN force in Rwanda to 5,500 in a report to be 
discussed by the Security Council. All but 400 of the 2,500 UN 
troops formerly in Rwanda were withdrawn after they proved 
powerless to stem a month-old bloodbath that has killed 200,000 
people. Mass slaughter engulfed the tiny central African 
country after president Juvenal Habyarimana was killed when his 
plane was downed on April 6. 
  A UN military official predicted Tuesday that Kigali would 
fall to the rebels within a week. He said battered government 
soldiers were deserting in large numbers, while remaining forces 
were "in disarray." Outside Kigali, heavy fighting raged 
Tuesday in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri, and in Bugesera, 
south of the capital, as the rebels tried to seize more 
territory from the Army. The rebels say they want to stop 
massacres of the minority Tutsi people, who make up 15 percent 
of the population, and opposition sympathisers.

  [Text] Radio Rwanda has announced that the self-imposed 
President Sindikubwabo will attend Mandela's swearing-in today. 
Sindikubwabo has nothing to celebrate in Mandela's victory. 
Mandela has been fighting for democracy and the creation of a 
just society for all, while Sindikubwabo is responsible for the 
massacres of hundreds of thousands of innocent people. 
Sindikubwabo has been committing genocide against the people of 
Tutsi origin in Rwanda. Oppression of one group of people 
against another group is what Mr. Mandela has been fighting 
throughout his life. Mr. Mandela is seen as a symbol of freedom 
the world over. Sindikubwabo is a wanted criminal for 
committing crimes against humanity. Sindikubwabo has not even 
been invited to attend today's occasion in South Africa because 
his government is illegitimate and has been denounced by the 
whole world. The victory of South Africans against apartheid 
should sound a warning for Sindikubwabo and his fascist 
colleagues that their days are numbered.

  [Excerpt] The election court today nullified the election 
of Mr. Geoffrey Muraya Macharia as the Forum for the Restoration 
of Democracy [FORD]-Asili MP for Mathare constituency in 
Nairobi. Justice Emmanuel O'Kubaso, John Mwera, and Gideon Mbito 
in their ruling said the electoral commission erred in not 
providing clearly marked ballot papers. As a result, the judges 
contended, over 43,000 ballot papers were unmarked, adding that 
a large number of votes were not stamped. The court ruled that 
after a recount, Muraya Macharia garnered 6,001 stamped votes 
and 16,344 unstamped votes. The petitioner, Mr. Frederick 
Masinde of FORD-Kenya, scored 8,306 stamped votes and 10,620 
unstamped votes. 
  Consequently, the judges explained that Mr. Masinde scored 
over 2,000 votes more than Mr. Muraya going by the number of the 
marked votes. The judges, however, noted that no election 
offense had been committed and ordered Mr. Muraya and the 
electoral commission to meet the cost of the suit. 
  In the 1992 general elections, Mr. Muraya garnered 23,864 
votes, while Mr. Masinde got 19,579. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The commander of defense forces, General Robert 
Mboma, has cautioned the Tanzania people's defense forces not to 
allow tribalism to infiltrate the Army. He sounded the warning 
in Mwanza town today while addressing commanders and servicemen 
of the defense forces in Mwanza region. Gen. Mboma said that if 
tribalism was allowed to infiltrate the Army it would create 
much havoc, as was currently the case in neighboring Rwanda 
where brother was fighting brother, each with the aim of 
eliminating the tribe of the other. 
  He said the Tanzanian nation was built on a foundation of 
unity and our Army embraced all the tribes of Tanzania, so 
anyone attempting to incite tribalism in the Army must be 
condemned. 
  Elaborating on the issue of tribalism, Gen. Mboma said that 
a 
good example was Ngara District which had a population of 
170,000 people but had now been invaded by over 350,000 Rwandan 
refugees who had fled the ethnic fighting in their country. He 
said he had never witnessed people killing each other so 
mercilessly as was now happening in Rwanda.

  [Text] Parliament today adopted a resolution at its resumed 
sitting in Accra to extend the state of emergency in seven 
districts of the Northern Region for one month. Moving for the 
adoption of the resolution, the minister of the interior, 
Colonel Osei-Wusu, said although the task force has largely 
succeeded in disarming the warring factions, removing 
roadblocks, and initiating resettlement [word indistinct] there 
are still a few isolated attacks and counterattacks in the 
conflict areas. He said the task force is determined that such 
hostilities are reduced to the barest minimum within the coming 
weeks. Col. Osei-Wusu said it is the government's intention 
that the exploratory talks will resume in the next few days to 
find the formula that will enable the state of emergency to be 
revoked within the shortest possible time. He said it is the 
expectation of government that the police will be in a position 
to take over from the military. 
  Adopting the resolution, some MP's impressed upon the 
minister to speed up a peaceful solution to the conflict so that 
there will be no need for the extension of the state of 
emergency at the end of the one-month period. It will be 
recalled that the president declared the state of emergency in 
seven districts of the Northern Region on 19 Febraury to enable 
the government to contain the volatile situation in the conflict 
areas.

  [Text] Guinea-Bissau's national electoral commission 
announced today that some 80 percent of the electorate is 
already on the electoral roll. This is good news for another 
process which has democratic intentions: 
  [Correspondent Fernando Pereira] The first pluralist 
election 
in Guinea-Bissau's history will probably take place toward the 
end of June or the beginning of July. The date has already been 
postponed three times, but everything leads us to believe that 
this time is for real, since the electoral roll is complete, 
which is the most important task. The CNE -- the National 
Electoral Commission, the top electoral body -- announced today 
the definite outcome of the process. A total of 404,000 people 
have been enrolled, 97,000 people alone in the capital. 
Attention is now focused on the head of state, Joao Bernardo 
Vieira, the only person who can set the date of the election by 
decree. According to law, that will only be done following the 
official release of the final figures of the electoral roll, 
which may happen within the next few days.

  [Text] Lagos, 10 May (AFP) -- Moshood Abiola, the 
self-declared winner of the 12 June 1993 presidential elections 
annulled by the military, has announced his intention to form a 
"government of national unity" and has asked General Sani 
Abacha's "illegal" government to bow out of office, THE NEWS 
magazine reported in its latest issue published today. 
  The multimillionaire Yoruba Muslim from southwest Nigeria 
maintained that "the only way to halt the present backsliding of 
the country into complete economic catastrophe, chaos, and 
collapse" is to concretize the mandate which, according to him, 
the people conferred on him on 12 June. He said he has 
therefore "decided to form a government of national unity whose 
legitimacy stems from the 12 June mandate. Further details on 
the concretization of this program will be announced in due 
course." 
  Mr. Abiola also called on "Gen. Abacha and his unelected 
team...to immediately vacate all the government functions which 
they have illegally filled and are performing." The immediate 
task of the "government of national unity" will be to put the 
country's economy back on its feet, to fight poverty, and to 
restore the democratic rights of all Nigerians, he said.

  [Text] The minister of home affairs has issued a statement 
regarding the work stoppage by some police officers in Maseru. 
The statement said the commissioner of police had information 
that police officers in Maseru will not go to work. He knew 
this at 6 o'clock in the evening last night. 
  The statement said during discussions the commissioner 
received written complaints from the police. It said this 
morning those complaints were tabled before the defense 
commission, which urged the Ministry of Home Affairs to table 
them before the cabinet. 
  Most of the requests had already been presented to the 
Ministry of Home Affairs by the commissioner of police. 
Following the decision made by the cabinet, a committee was 
established to look into their requests. The committee ended 
its work last week and its findings will be announced soon. 
  The ministry therefore appeals to the police officers who 
were not carrying out their normal duties to return to work, as 
their requests were being attended to. 
  Meanwhile, the strike by police initially reported in Maseru 
this morning has spread to other districts of the country, and 
in Maseru looters took advantage of the situation and emptied 
some of the shops situated at the old bus stop. The looted 
shops include bakers and hypermarkets, prompting their owners to 
call members of Security Lesotho to quell the looting. Members 
of the Lesotho Defense Force also arrived at the scene to put 
the situation under control. 
  Other districts affected by the strike are Mafiteng, Leribe, 
and Butha Buthe. In Mafiteng the work stoppage began this 
morning, when a notice saying there were no services was mounted 
at the gate of the Mafiteng police station. Police officers who 
normally assist at the district secretary's office also did not 
turn up for work. 
  In Leribe the police said they began the strike after 
receiving word from someone who said he was calling from the 
police headquarters in Maseru informing them about the strike. 
The news spread to the Butha Buthe police and they also joined 
the action.

  [Text] Carlos Reis, chairman of the Mozambican National 
Union, Unamo, has said his political organization will boycott 
the first multiparty elections in Mozambique, scheduled for 
October. Reis said his movement's decision is due to the fact 
that the Mozambique Liberation Front, the international 
community, and the UN Operations in Mozambique have not 
allocated the money for the political parties' trust fund. 
Carlos Reis was speaking at a banquet held in the South African 
Embassy in Maputo marking the inauguration of Nelson Mandela.

  [Text] Pretoria May 10 SAPA -- The United States wanted to 
be "as good a partner as possible" because South Africa's new 
government's success was essential, American Vice-President Al 
Gore said on Tuesday [10 May] night. Mr Gore and President 
Nelson Mandela were addressing the press after a meeting at the 
Presidency in Pretoria at which "in-depth" discussions were held 
on problems facing the Mandela administration. 
  He had briefed Mr Gore on the African National Congress' 
Reconstruction and Development Programme which would require 
"vast resources", Mr Mandela said. "Mr Gore has noted what I 
have said and I know if it is in his power he'll be able to 
consider it. In the past he has responded excellently to our 
proposals." 
  Mr Gore said he was briefed on Mr Mandela's intention to 
address the problems of 50 per cent unemployment, 60 per cent 
illiteracy and the seven million homeless people in South 
Africa. "The United States wishes to be as good a partner as is 
possible because the success of this government is essential for 
South Africa as a beacon of hope," Mr Gore said. 
  Mr Gore conveyed to Mr Mandela US President Bill Clinton's 
congratulations on his inauguration as president. They had also 
explored ways in which to address the civil war in Rwanda in 
central Africa, Mr Mandela said. He said he had not yet had 
talks with Organisation for African Unity Secretary-General 
Salim Ahmed Salim on the matter. Asked if he thought it 
advisable that the OAU or the international community organise a 
force to intervene in Rwanda, Mr Mandela said: "If a force went 
there for law and order and to save lives...that's necessary." 
He did not want to go into details about the matter before he 
had spoken to Mr Salim, he said.

  [Text] Foreign aid does not have a good reputation in the 
United States. There is an understandable perception that it's 
wrong to dispense charity abroad when so much is needed at home. 
There is also a feeling that much foreign aid simply drains 
into the bottomless pit of incompetent, spendthrift Third World 
countries. 
  As a result, legislation is being overhauled this year to 
make foreign aid more flexible and allow its use as an incentive 
for countries which pursue the right political and economic 
policies. The $600 million development, trade and investment 
package which President Clinton has offered South Africa over 
the next three years should be seen in this light. 
  Most of the money is intended for the private sector rather 
than government. Much is indirect aid or seed money aimed at 
"leveraging" greater amounts of private sector investment, both 
domestic and American. So, typically, the aid will consist of 
guarantees to building societies and other institutions to grant 
housing loans to black homeowners, or credit to black 
businessmen or guarantees to U.S. businesses to cover 
investments here. 
  The idea is to help jump-start the economy to the growth 
level needed to deliver the material needs of the back 
population. Not included in the $600 million total is the 
lifting of duties on 4,400 categories of South African products 
imported into the U.S. And the package is also designed to 
promote American business by opening up trade and investment in 
what America has identified as one of the world's top 10 
emerging markets. 
  South Africa should be reassured by this pragmatic approach. 
Ultimately it is only a flourishing private sector which will 
meet development needs.

ready to establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. In a 
message presented to President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria, 
Castro also offered Cuba's assistance to the new South African 
Government. He said he would support this new stage in South

"I hope you are successful". Mr de Klerk then introduced Mr

  [Text] British Prime Minister John Major could visit South 
Africa soon. British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in 
Pretoria that Mr. Major was very keen on coming to South Africa. 
He said a visit paid by the queen was also very much in the 
cards after South Africa rejoins the Commonwealth. Mr. Michael 
Heseltine, the British trade and industry minister, is also due 
in South Africa in July along with 50 of Britain's most senior 
businessmen in an effort to restore trade links. 
  Another world leader expected to visit South Africa soon is 
French President Francois Mitterrand, who will probably arrive 
next month. French Justice Minister Pierre Mehaignerie made 
this announcement in Pretoria after leading the French 
delegation to the inauguration of President Mandela. Mr. 
Mehaignerie said France should bolster its stakes in tourism, 
industry, housing, and public works in South Africa.

  [Text] After South Africa's first black president, Nelson 
Mandela, was sworn in before a host of world leaders in 
Pretoria, pledges of financial aid and closer diplomatic ties 
came from across the world. 
  The European Union says it plans to invest about 700 million 
rands in South Africa to help the government fulfill the 
expectations of the country's citizens. A member of the Union's 
executive, Mr. Hans van den Broek, said in Pretoria that the new 
government would need foreign aid for the difficult work that 
lies ahead. He said people were justified in having high hopes 
but that it would be a hard task satisfying them in the short 
term. 
  Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General 
Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it 
easier to export to Canada. Application of the General 
Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible 
imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33 
percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1 
million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years. 
This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90 
million rands. 
  Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The 
German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South 
Africa's new government needs international confidence and 
support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the 
chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so 
great as in South Africa. Other nations who announced plans to 
boost relations with South Africa are Indonesia, Morocco, 
Bangladesh, China, India, and Singapore.

  [Text] Pretoria, May 11 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui continued a series of meetings with South 
African and other foreign officials here Wednesday [11 May]. 
  Early in the morning, Li met with several officials of the 
African National Congress (ANC), South Africa's new ruling 
party, for wide-ranging talks. 
  Raymond Tai, spokesman for the ROC Presidential Office who 
is 
accompanying Li on his current global tour, told the reporters 
that Li reaffirmed the ROC's determination to assist South 
Africa in its economic development. 
  "The ROC also looks forward to strengthening cooperation 
with 
the new South African Government," Tai quoted Li as telling the 
ANC officials. 
  Li also met with Burkina Faso's foreign minister and special 
envoys from several other African countries who were here to 
attend the swearing-in ceremony of Nelson Mandela as South 
Africa's first black president. 
  Later in the day Wednesday, Li will host a luncheon in honor 
of former South African President F.W. de Klerk, who is now the 
country's vice president, Tai said. 
  Li is also schduled to meet with President Mandela Wednesday 
evening. Mandela visited Taipei last year. 
  On Tuesday, Li met briefly with leaders and spcial envoys 
from many countries, including U.S. Vice President Al Gore and 
First Lady Hillary Clinton, Philippine Vice President Joseph E. 
Estrada and Yasir 'Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, after Mandela's swearing-in ceremony. 
  Meanwhile, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, said here Tuesday that the 
ROC Government will encourage Taiwan businessmen to increase 
investment in South Africa. 
  "Such investment will help improve economic conditions in 
South Africa and consolidate relations between Taipei and 
Pretoria," noted Hsiao, who is also accompanying President Li on 
his current global visit. 
  There are now 300 Taiwan-owned companies in South Africa, 
creating 40,000 jobs for black people here, Hsiao added. 
  Li and his entourage arrived in Pretoria Monday evening 
following a five-day visit to Nicaragua and Costa Rica in 
Central America. He is scheduled to leave for Swaziland 
Thursday on the final leg of his four-nation state visit.

<F P=106> [Article by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>
  [Text] As the new democratic government took its historic 
first steps in Cape Town yesterday, it was obviously the 
beginning of a new era with former enemies assuming collective 
responsibility for South Africa. 
  It was also obvious that two of the most important players 
in 
the African National Congress had been sidelined, deliberately 
or systematically. ANC secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa was 
excluded from the cabinet of the National Assembly as it 
gathered in Cape Town. Jay Naidoo, the fiery former 
general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, 
is Minister Without Portfolio. While it is said Ramaphosa's 
omission was at his own request, it indeed has a far-reaching 
effect on the ANC-South African Communist Party-COSATU [Congress 
of South African Trade Unions] alliance. 
  Added to that is the fact that Naidoo was tipped for the 
portfolio of Minister of Manpower in the ANC government. It is 
prudent, therefore, that an attempt be made to chart the power 
design of the ANC alliance, as led by man-in-the-middle 
President Nelson Mandela. 
  -- Ramaphosa shouldered the primary responsibility of 
negotiating the new dispensation on behalf of his party. He was 
second on the ANC list after Mandela and as such was the natural 
choice for first executive Deputy President. However, the 
riddle remains. Ramaphosa accepted his current post in the ANC 
in 1991 on the workers' ticket. He was then general secretary of 
the powerful National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] which formed 
the bulk of COSATU membership. 
  -- Naidoo once intimated in an interview that he was the 
person most employers loved to hate. And he was depicted in 
some newspaper cartoons as the devil incarnate, complete with 
horns. It was, after all, COSATU that designed the ANC's 
Reconstruction and Development Programme [RDP]. Therefore, 
argument is that the RDP was watered down considerably before 
being accepted. This indicates trade unionists, or workers, in 
the alliance were being pressured down for pushing hardline 
economic policies. The fact of the matter is that COSATU 
bolstered the ANC election campaign when it agreed to fight the 
poll under its banner. There are other pertinent factors to the 
ANC power design, namely, the ANC's internal wing during its 
twilight years in exile. 
  -- The United Democratic Front [UDF] held the movement's 
banner, especially bringing to a head the country's politics in 
the mid-1980s. While it is not surprising that important former 
UDF leaders Popo Molefe and Patrick Lekota were nominated for 
premier posts, it becomes clearer that this sector of the 
broader ANC movement was being appeased, or accommodated, in the 
power design. 
  Molefe is premier for the Northwest province, while Lekota 
heads the [Orange] Free State parliament. The two men were 
instrumental in resistance campaigns, which saw them being 
jailed in the marathon Delmas Trial in the aftermath of the 1984 
anti-high rent unrest in Vaal Triangle townships. The argument 
goes even further. 
  -- The appointment by Mandela of aging former ANC 
secretary-general Alfred Nzo to the post of Minister of Foreign 
Affairs has been met with wide criticism. Debate surrounding 
his appointment, albeit political, emphasises another attempt to 
accommodate the ANC's former exiled leadership in the cabinet. 
Charismatic Thabo Mbeki, executive Deputy President-elect, 
falls in this category even though he was favoured for the 
Foreign Ministry portfolio. Dr Pallo Jordan was the obvious 
choice for Minister of Information as head of the ANC's 
department of information and publicity. 
  -- Then there is the ANC's "old guard" -- Mandela's men, so 
to speak. Here one refers to the Rivonia trialists, but the 
only conspicuous appointment is that of Govan Mbeki as Eastern 
Cape premier. Poignantly, if workers within the ANC alliance 
were to ally themselves with the Ramaphosa-Naidoo cabal -- which 
is not formal, perhaps not yet -- a powerful anti-ANC party on 
the workers' ticket could emerge. But it is Ramaphosa who will 
be in focus post-May 10. He has yet to explain why he 
"requested" not to be in the cabinet as Mandela announces his 
men and women in government in Pretoria tomorrow. It is also 
widely believed Ramaphosa turned down the offer of Foreign 
Minister after he failed to become Deputy President. 
  Another argument, however, is that although he did a fine 
job 
as NUM general-secretary there is a view among the ANC youth 
leaders that he was not really in "the struggle" because he 
negotiated with management in the comfort of boardrooms. 
Indeed, as the celebrations end and after Mandela has 
reluctantly sipped the ugly-smelling stuff called champagne at 
the Union Buildings in Pretoria, Cyril Ramaphosa and Jay Naidoo 
will be the men to watch.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 10 SAPA -- The Transitional 
Executive Council [TEC] and Minister of Finance, Derek Keys, on 
Tuesday [10 May] issued a joint declaration of intent for South 
Africa to become a member of the African Development Bank. 
  This follows a series of missions to South Africa by 
representatives of the African Development Bank group since 
1991. The Development Bank of South Africa [DBSA] said it had 
been decided that the republic would officially enter into a 
series of consultations with the African Development Bank group 
on the terms and conditions of South Africa's membership. 
  These consultations would be pursued under the auspices of 
the government of national unity and might eventually lead to 
South Africa becoming a fully fledged member of Africa's premier 
development financing institution, the DBSA said. 
  The group has earmarked between R720-million [rand] to 
R1.26-billion a year over the next five years for financing 
investment projects and programmes to both South Africa's public 
and private sectors, to enhance economic and social development. 
The funds could come in the form of long term loans to finance 
public sector project investments in agriculture, public 
utilities, transportation, education, health and industry, or 
long-term lines of credit to national development banks to 
finance private sector projects or medium- to long-term loans 
and equity investments, in all productive sectors of the 
economy, made directly to the private sector. 
  The DBSA said it was probable a significant portion of the 
group's resources to South Africa would be targeted at 
disadvantaged South Africans. However, it was up to South 
Africa to decide finally on such resource allocation from 
African Development Bank sources. 
  There were also opportunities for South African firms to 
supply goods and services for the execution of the group's 
projects throughout Africa. In addition, South Africa could 
draw on the group's grant-based technical assistance. 
  South African representatives would attend the group's 
annual 
general meeting in Nairobi from May 11 to 13, at which the 
declaration of intent would be tabled. A series of joint South 
African/African Development Bank Group consultations would 
follow the successful adoption of the declaration of intent, the 
DBSA said.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 10 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress 
[PAC] Secretary General Benny Alexander on Tuesday [10 May] 
night confirmed he had requested to be relieved of his position 
to concentrate as the sole PAC provincial assembly 
representative. "It will not be possible for me to carry the 
workload as sole PAC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
provincial assembly representative and the workload as secretary 
general. I will, however, remain a member of the National 
Executive Committee and remain a loyal and disciplined member of 
the party," he said in a statement. He said the matter had 
still to be discussed by the National Working Committee. "I 
must express surprise at reading of my confidential 
correspondence to the president in the media, especially as the 
matter has still to be discussed by the National Working 
Committee," he said.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 10 SAPA -- About 250 members of the 
African National Congress' military wing were stranded outside 
the ANC's Johannesburg headquarters on Tuesday [10 May] night 
after officials failed to process them for integration into the 
new South African National Defence Force, a spokesman for the 
disgruntled MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC 
military wing] members claimed. 
  Mr Mathews Dikane said the large Umkhonto we Sizwe group 
arrived in Johannesburg on Friday last week after being told by 
MK officials at Shell House that they should report to an 
assembly point at Wallmannstal near Pretoria. 
  "We travelled in 31 taxis from Port Elizabeth, but when we 
reported at the assembly point near Pretoria we were turned 
away. We then returned to Shell House, but since Friday we have 
not heard a thing from the MK people in the building. We have 
nothing to eat, no accommodation and we are sleeping in the 
taxis. The taxi drivers were told they would be paid when they 
came to Johannesburg, but now they are stuck here with no money 
coming from MK officials. The leadership of the organisation, 
including Mr Nelson Mandela, have not been told about our 
desperate plight," said Mr Dikane. 
  Most of the MK cadres had returned from training camps 
abroad 
only last year, he added. Comment could not be obtained from 
ANC headquarters on Tuesday night.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Now Time for Tackling Reconstruction -- Johannesburg THE 
STAR 
in English on 11 May in a page-14 editorial says the 
inauguration ceremony of President Nelson Mandela and the 
accompanying festivities shows firstly, "the widespread and 
genuine interest which the international community takes in the 
reborn South Africa, and its anxiety to make it work." 
Secondly, it shows how "South Africans can put ancient 
differences aside to express a common joy and a common loyalty 
to the country." Thirdly, it shows that "even if South Africa's 
record in organising first-time all-race elections is a bit 
spotty, we can hold our own with anyone when it comes to staging 
a really five-star wing-ding." The editorial also says it hopes 
President Mandela, and everyone, "understands that this has to 
be the last of an unnatural run of non-working days. After this 
it's sleeves up and on with the tasks that lie ahead. Ours is a 
country that needs a lot of construction and reconstruction." 
  Liberation Movement Lets Down Coloreds in Western Cape -- In 
an article on page 14, Frank Meintjies, who is a director of the 
community-based Development Program, and a former media 
spokesman of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, writes 
that "it is surprising that so many people are taken aback at 
the election outcome in the Western Cape where the predominantly 
colored electorate voted the National Party [NP] into regional 
power." Meintjies contends that it was not the NP that won 
colored support, but "perhaps it is the coloureds who can claim 
to have been let down by the parties in the `liberation 
movement' camp. The ANC for example: -- Failed to adequately 
answer concerns of coloured voters as to how affirmative action 
will apply. --Until recently, imposed a more Africanist 
political strategy in the Western Cape at the expense of the 
more pluralistic style of the UDF [United Democratic Front]. -- 
Hailed De Klerk a man of integrity even before he had apologised 
for excesses of apartheid." The liberation parties also 
"insisted on the 'so-called' prefix when using the word 
coloured. This was intended to undermine the classifications of 
apartheid; instead it fed coloureds' negative self-image." "In 
the end, the Western Cape coloured community -- without much 
else to go on -- turned to De Klerk, the sinner turned 'man of 
integrity'. Faced with uncertain times, they sought a home with 
the party they saw as culturally closer in terms of language and 
religion and understanding of their marginal position." As for 
the future of the colored people, Meintjies believes that in the 
short term colored people "will have to stand back in favour of 
the advancement of African people." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Opportunity To Generate Economic Growth -- Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 May in its page-16 editorial notes 
that economically, South Africa "has everything going for it -- 
and the presence of leaders from 160 countries illustrates this. 
And yet, confidence in our new-found national purpose remains 
fragile. The slide in out gold and foreign reserves need not be 
a worry if we remain on our present track, but it underscores 
the uncertainty of investors and businessmen whose decisions 
will determine whether South Africa's economy takes off or 
falters." BUSINESS DAY points out that aid packages and 
improved trade relations "will not solve our economic problems 
alone. Our own efforts will be far more important. We should 
not forget that aid and trade concessions are generally granted 
because they serve a donor nation's self-interest, not because 
of any innate generosity. While, for example, South Africa's 
precipitately negotiated access to the United States' 
Generalised System of Preferences is to be welcomed, we have not 
won terms any more favourable than those extended to most other 
developing countries. The new duty exemptions on 4,000-odd 
items announced last week should make a big difference to 
producers of those goods. But it does little more than bring us 
into line with most non-OECD [Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development] countries, and leaves us less 
favoured, in terms of access to the U.S. market, than countries 
of South and Central America and Israel. Nevertheless, an 
opportunity has opened -- the opportunity to generate strong 
economic growth without fear of the foreign exchange constraints 
that nipped previous expansions in the bud." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Call To Limit Availability of Guns -- "We hope the new 
Government will live up to its promise to limit the availability 
of guns in South Africa," declares a page-8 editorial in 
Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 11 May. The paper calls for a 
curb on the "illegal inflow of guns from neighbouring states and 
the large number of weapons in the hands of rightwingers. For 
instance, efforts must be undertaken by the new National Defence 
Force to retrieve weapons issued to commando units."

  [Text] Bujumbura, 11 May (KNA/PANA) -- The United Nations 
human rights high commissioner, Jose Ayala Lasso, is expected in 
Rwanda Wednesday [11 May] for a meeting with belligerents in the 
Rwandan civil war and the United Nations special representative, 
Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh. 
  Ayala Lasso, who has just ended a 48-hour visit to Burundi, 
reaffirmed Tuesday in Bujumbura that the high commission was 
ready to "cooperate in all the areas related to the protection 
and promotion of human rights" in this country. The 
commission's future cooperation with Burundi on issues of human 
rights, he said, had been identified with the top officials of 
the country. Some of these are, for example, support for 
judicial institutions, the training of judges, education for the 
promotion, and protection of human rights.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Kigali, May 11 (AFP) -- Rebels battled 
government soldiers in Rwanda's capital Kigali on Wednesday [11 
May] as rebel leader Paul Kagame welcomed proposals for a bigger 
UN force provided its role remained "humanitarian." But Kagame 
said the 5,500-strong force suggested by UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali "to stop the genocide" was too big. 
  The United Nations was strongly condemned by aid agencies 
for 
withdrawing all but 400 of its 2,500 soldiers days after the 
death of President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious April 6 
plane crash hurled Rwanda into an epic bloodbath that has 
already cost 200,000 lives. 
  "We've done most of the work of the UN," Kagame told 
reporters in Byumba, northern Rwanda, after talks with UN force 
commander General Romeo Dallaire and UN High Commissioner for 
Human Rights Jose Ayala Lasso. Kagame said he had assured them 
that the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) would not attack a 
humanitarian force but stressed that it was too late for 
military intervention "because the genocide has already been 
carried out." 
  The United Nations, he said, had left "the Rwandese facing 
the tragedy." "We have no problem with a force that will come 
to assist us on a humanitarian basis," Kagame said. "We are only 
opposed to an intervention force." 
  The RPF had earlier warned that it would treat a foreign 
intervention force as hostile invaders. 
  Kagame also renewed his call for the resignation of UN envoy 
to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, who has denied accusations by 
the rebels that he supported the government. 
  As dawn rose over Kigali's hills, covered in banana trees, 
rebel and army gunners pounded each other's positions with 
intense artillery and mortar barrages for about two hours, a UN 
military spokesman said. The fighting then subsided, but small 
arms fire persisted in different areas throughout the day, the 
spokesman said. 
  The proposed UN force would escort food and medical convoys 
to more than a million people displaced by the fighting and 
risking famine. Up to half a million Rwandans have fled to 
neighbouring countries. The UN force would also establish a 
neutral zone around Kigali airport, a vital lifeline if mass 
starvation is to be averted. 
  Fighting between rebels and government soldiers encamped 
around the airport has repeatedly prevented relief flights 
landing. The new UN troops would be allowed to fire back if 
attacked. But they would not be empowered to shoot first in 
offensive "peacemaking" operations as they did in Somalia. 
[passage omitted] 
  UN military officials have described the current fighting in 
Kigali as the rebels' final onslaught against battered 
government forces, many of whose soldiers have deserted. 
  But General Dallaire told reporters that the battle for 
Kigali could last a long time. 
  "It would be unreasonable to say that the Rwanda Patriotic 
Front will take Kigali in three days," he said, explaining that 
"both armies are small" and neither side could sustain a big 
offensive. 
  The rebels brought in munitions and evacuated casualties in 
small trucks or "on their backs," he said. Some army soldiers 
fought well, though the government has lost the military 
initiative to the rebels, who now control two-thirds of the 
country, he said.

  [Excerpts] The United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda 
is asking for an increase of UN troops in Rwanda. In a report 
presented to the UN Security Council yesterday, Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali supported the idea. [passage omitted] 
  Among the countries which are likely to send troops are 
Guinea, Australia, and France. The president of the latter says 
that France would send its troops to Rwanda if requested. 
However, we hope that the United Nations would not dream of 
sending French troops to Rwanda, as Rwandans and the world 
community saw for themselves what the French troops did when 
they were there. 
  The lack of interest by the world community in sending 
international troops is mainly due to a lack of understanding. 
It is the clique in power which continues to ask for the 
international troops. This is in turn due to the pressure of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] troops on their troops. 
Recently, in Arusha, the so-called government thought that it 
was going to meet the RPF. But the RPF refused to meet that 
government. They [the government] asked that the international 
community station troops between the two warring sides believing 
that this could stop the war that they had themselves started 
through their countrywide massacres. An end to the fighting, 
they hope, would permit the talks between the RPF and the 
government which have not taken place yet, to go ahead. The RPF 
believes that the most urgent assistance that could be given to 
Rwandans is not the dispatch of troops but of relief assistance 
consisting of food, medicine, and other necessities. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Saliou Toure, minister of higher education and </F>
scientific research, in Abidjan -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Fellow countrymen: As you know, our country is 
hard hit by the economic crisis that has persisted for more than 
a decade now. The Ivorian school system has not been spared by 
the effects of this crisis, which has affected all aspects of 
life. Since 1990, the school system has been experiencing 
serious problems which have been of great concern to the 
government. Virtually, not a single week goes by without a 
strike or serious and unjustified acts of vandalism occurring in 
the national university and in our schools. Loyal to its policy 
of peace, the government has employed and continues to employ 
all avenues of dialogue to remedy the situation. However, we are 
compelled to say that the situation has been going from bad to 
worse. It is therefore with a sad heart that we have come to 
talk to you about the Ivorian school system and the crisis it is 
experiencing. [passage omitted] 
  Our children must go to school and sit their examinations 
without allowing themselves to be distracted by the surprising 
behavior of some them -- those belonging to the Federation of 
University and High School Students of Cote d'Ivoire [FESCI] 
which we have to mention by name -- who constitute the activists 
of the school system. 
  FESCI is a student organization that is supposed to 
represent 
students' interests but in actual fact this organization is 
rather quick to engage in politics in accordance with Article 2 
of its by- laws, which states that, quote, FESCI reserves the 
right to express its opinion on any national issue directly or 
indirectly affecting the education and training of the youth, 
unquote. It also states in the preamble of the same by-laws 
that it believes, quote, that the current crisis in school and 
university circles cannot be curbed with circumstantial 
measures, but with a total overhaul of our country, unquote. 
These are all facts that prove the indisputable political 
involvement of FESCI, which is not a students' union as one may 
think. [passage omitted] 
  The case of FESCI presents a disturbing peculiarity in the 
eyes of the law. Although FESCI was dissolved on 20 June 1991 
by the government, following the murder of the student Thierry 
Zebie on 17 June of the same year, it has continued its 
activities with the tolerance of the public authorities. 
[passage omitted] Today, the government's tolerance, which is 
aimed at defusing tension, tends to be perceived as a civic 
weakness. However, the 30 July 1992 Amnesty Law was not meant 
to reconstitute FESCI. 
  Consequently, in the eyes of the law, FESCI is still a 
dissolved association. The fact that it continues to exist 
implies the maintenance or restitution of a banned association, 
which is mentioned and punished under Article 34 of Law 60315 of 
21 September 1960. This law provides for a penalty of 300,000 
CFA francs and one to three years' imprisonment. The truth of 
the matter is that FESCI doubtlessly appears to be the secular 
arm of certain political parties, which use it as they wish to 
settle their differences and to engage, in the name of 
education, in insurrectional political activities. Hence, the 
incoherent and, sometimes, surprising nature of some student 
demands. [passage omitted] 
  The educational, economic, financial, social, and security 
repercussions are incalculable. Educationally, the prestigious 
image of the school system has been tarnished. For some years 
now, lectures and tutorials are not conducted according to the 
required academic standards. Academic years are cut short -- 
instead of nine, they are spread over only three months. The 
most serious consequence of this situation is the nonrecognition 
of our certificates abroad. Today, a second degree holder from 
Abidjan who wants to register at an European or American 
university is forced to start afresh from the first year as if 
he just obtained his senior high school certificate. Can we 
continue like this? [passage omitted] 
  History will surely not forgive us. We must therefore 
react to stop this lawlessness. The government will assume its 
responsibilities with the support of all those who are committed 
to saving the Ivorian school system by upholding the supremacy 
of the law. 
  To conclude, the crisis in the Ivorian educational system -- 
such as we have just described it -- concerns us all. It must 
first concern the university and other students themselves, who 
are the first victims because the issue at stake relates first 
and foremost to their future. It must concern parents who, 
after sacrificing their savings and even going sometimes to the 
extent of borrowing money to educate their wards to guarantee 
their future, will gain nothing if their efforts go up in smoke. 
It must concern teachers, supervisors, and all those who in one 
way or the other are involved in educating the sons and 
daughters of this country. It must concern all who care about 
the country's future, which depends primarily on the youth and 
its education. Last, it must concern all those who care about 
the future of this country as a whole. 
  It is therefore not without bitterness that we point out the 
undignified and selfish behavior of a minority of our countrymen 
who, after attaining comfortable positions as products of our 
school system, are now preventing our children from enrolling in 
our educational establishments by masterminding terrorist 
actions committed unrelentingly by an insignificant group of 
students at our university campuses and second cycle 
institutions. 
  The government is aware of the difficulties facing our 
children today, considering the persistent economic crisis whose 
most recent consequence is the devaluation of the CFA franc to 
enable the recovery of our various economies, recovery that can 
only be achieved in an atmosphere of sustained social peace. 
Each one of us at whatever level, including the students, is 
suffering the hardships brought about by the crisis. However, 
in spite of the adverse effects of the crisis, Cote d'Ivoire 
continues to view education as a priority among priorities. 
Indeed, the government continues to allocate 45 percent of its 
recurrent budget to the education sector. Social transfers 
alone, that is accommodation, scholarship allowances, feeding, 
and diverse subsidies, account for 42 percent of this budgetary 
allocation. This has never been seen anywhere, not even in the 
developed countries. [passage omitted] 
  We thought that these efforts, virtually unique in the world 
in relative terms, would tone down the protesting zeal of our 
students and render them more reasonable. Unfortunately, as 
anyone would realize, that is far from the case. I therefore 
urge students to be more realistic and to appreciate 
government's efforts within our social and economic context. 
The government calls on all to be vigilant and mobilized to 
eradicate, once and for all, this scourge which could seriously 
compromise our country's economic recovery if care is not taken. 
  On its part, the government will do all within its power to 
quickly and definitely restore law and order in our schools and 
colleges. [passage omitted] The issue at stake is the future of 
our dear country, Cote d'Ivoire. The future of our youth is so 
vital in this regard that political calculations alone cannot 
remove the present tragedy of the Ivorian school system. For 
goodness sake, let us stop toying with the future of the youth 
in order that the Ivorian educational system may regain its past 
glory and credibility. 
  Dear university and other students, many are those who, 
today, feel the need to carry on peacefully with their studies. 
We urge you to come back to your senses and to go back to 
school quietly, with discipline, and above all with tolerance. 
Cote d'Ivoire, which has made enormous sacrifices to turn you 
into worthy citizens, counts on you to meet the challenges of 
development. However, it must be clear that the government can 
no longer afford to look on patiently and that in the event of 
any disturbances adequate measures will be taken to restore 
peace. Let us together save the Ivorian educational system in 
order that Cote d'Ivoire may always remain united and 
prosperous. Thank you.

  [Text] An official statement issued in Accra today says the 
government considers as unfortunate the recent decision of the 
New Patriotic Party, NPP, to pull out of the dialogue between 
the government and the nonparliamentary opposition, in which the 
NPP is involved. The statement said the NPP's decision was in a 
letter addressed last week to the presidential adviser on 
governmental affairs, to which a reply has been issued. It said 
the government is still committed to dialogue as a means of 
achieving national unity, stability, and reconciliation. It 
will, therefore, be prepared to resume dialogue with the NPP 
whenever wise counsel prevails. The statement stressed that it 
is the hope of government that, for the sake of the stability 
and peace of the nation and all Ghanaians, the NPP opposition 
will renounce the politics of violence, abuse, and 
confrontation, and genuinely create conditions conducive to 
dialogue. This is because dialogue is an essential basis of 
multiparty democracy and national development. 
  Meanwhile, the statement blamed the present development on 
the activities of some elements within the NPP. It noted one of 
the early signals as the ultimatum issued by the party last year 
to break off the dialogue when representatives of both sides 
were busy resolving certain technical matters. Besides, since 
the first meeting took place, some leading figures of the NPP 
have made inflammatory utterances contrary to the spirit of the 
dialogue. They have also continued what the statement called 
their media campaign of vilification and character assassination 
against the government. It also noted that while the dialogue 
was still on the NPP continued to pursue their plan to make the 
country ungovernable, through street demonstrations and other 
forms of confrontation. 
  It thus became obvious long ago that the NPP did not enter 
the dialogue in good faith or with any serious commitment to 
achieving any positive result, but just as a propaganda ploy. 
The statement pointed out that the review of the electoral 
system, which was the most important concern raised by the NPP 
during the inaugural meeting of the dialogue, has already been 
taken up by the National Electoral Commission, NEC. Also under 
the auspices of NEC, a series of meetings have been held 
involving all the political parties, with the active 
participation of the international donors. Besides, a number of 
important decisions have been taken which are binding on all 
parties.

  [Text] Bissau, 11 May (ANG/PANA) -- A presidential decree 
issued in Bissau today announced that the country's first 
multiparty presidential and parliamentary elections will be held 
on 3 July. 
  The decree stated that President Joao Bernardo Vieira chose 
that date following the proposal by the National Electoral 
Commission to hold the elections between 26 June and 10 July. 
The elections were initially scheduled for 27 March, but were 
postponed. 
  The announcement of the new election date comes a day after 
the Electoral Commission published the official and final 
electoral list of 404,521 voters. Bissau, which has 97,520 
voters, represents nearly a quarter of the electorate. This 
gives it the right to have 20 parliamentarians. 
  Thirteen parties, including 12 opposition parties, have 
already begun their campaigns, while two other parties -- the 
Socialist Party and the National Convention -- await 
legalization. Six candidates, all of whom are from the 
opposition, have already joined the presidential race. Their 
main objective is to defeat President "Nino" Vieira, 60, who 
came to power on 14 November 1980, as well as his party, the 
African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape 
Verde [PAIGC], which led the country to independence on 10 
September 1974. 
  Aboubacar Djalo, leader of the Ecological Protection League, 
is the candidate for the "Union for Change," which is a 
coalition of six parties including the Democratic Front, the 
Democratic and Social Front, the United Movement for 
Development, the Party for the People's Development, the Party 
for Renovation and Development, and the Ecological Protection 
League. 
  Other presidential aspirants are current President Joao 
Bernardo Vieira, PAIGC chairman; Domingos Fernandes Gomes, the 
Guinea-Bissau Resistance-Bafata Movement leader; Victor Saude 
Maria, chairman of the United Social Democratic Party; and Kumba 
Iala, leader of the Party for Social Renovation. Francois 
Kankoila Mendy, leader of the Guinea-Bissau National Liberation

  [Text] Talks to resolve the political aspect of the crisis 
in ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
are expected to resume today at ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] headquarters, after 
failing to reach any definite conclusion yesterday--although 
good progress was reportedly made. 
  The talks, which lasted six hours, were held between 
representatives of both Alhaji Koromah and Roosevelt Johnson, 
who did not attend yesterday's talks. Mr. Johnson showed up 
yesterday morning, but left after Mr. Koromah failed to appear. 
  Present at the talks were Mr. Raleigh Seekie, Mr. Gbaigbala, 
Mr. Joseph Tediah, and Maxwell Kaba, among others. The military 
aspect of the ULIMO talks were completed recently, with an 
agreement by the two sides to cease fire and allow ECOMOG to 
take control of all roads within ULIMO areas. 
  Meanwhile, the Citizens Peace Mission [CPM] has commended 
the 
leadership of ULIMO for the present bold and courageous 
decisions taken, which culminated in issuing of a communique 
calling for an immediate and unconditional cease-fire between 
forces loyal to the national chairman, Alhaji Koromah, and 
[words indistinct] chairman Roosevelt Johnson. 
  In a release issued, the CPM also commended the Liberia 
Peace 
Council, the LPC, for requesting deployment of ECOMOG and UNIMIL 
[UN Observer Mission in Liberia] in the political subdivisions 
under its control, which it said also amounts to an 
unconditional and immdiate cease-fire between the LPC and NPFL 
fighting forces. 
  The Citizens Peace Mission expressed gratitude to ECOMOG and 
UNIMIL for their role in bringing the conflicting parties of 
ULIMO to the conference table. They hope that the Freetown 
experience will not be repeated.

  [Text] Monrovia, 11 May (AFP) -- The fighting between 
Mandingos and Krahns, the two rival clans within the United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO] -- Liberian 
armed faction -- continued today, north of Monrovia, despite the 
cease-fire reached in principle by the two warring sides which 
have been involved in negotiation efforts since 9 May. The 
continued fighting was noted by the Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG] and 
confirmed to AFP by a spokesman for the Mandingos who stated 
that the Krahns attacked them yesterday evening at Suehn, 35 km 
north of Monrovia. 
  Colonel Wealtu Sawyea, commander of the Krahn forces, told 
the media today that the cease-fire order had not been sent to 
him up to now by the clan leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, the 
ULIMO military commander. The general's supporters stated that 
his "old mother" as well as a ULIMO Krahn leader, Harry Nayou, 
were "taken hostage" by Mandingo fighters in Tubmanburg, 60 km 
north of Monrovia. They stated that the fighting would not stop 
as long as these two people were not released. 
  The continued fighting did not prevent the negotiations from 
resuming this morning at the ECOMOG headquarters in Monrovia 
between Gen. Johnson and Alhaji Koromah, the Mandingo clan 
leader and ULIMO chairman. On the third consecutive day the 
discussions were to center on the sharing between Mandingos and 
Krahns of the posts allocated to ULIMO within the transitional 
institutions. 
  Gen. Johnson's supporters continue saying that their rivals 
have taken hold of most of these posts -- two in the Council of 
State, seven in the government, and nine in the Parliament -- 
while the two ethnic groups have the same number of members 
within the ULIMO. Mr. Koromah and his supporters, according to 
an informed source, dismissed these allegations, describing 
their adversaries' demands as "irrealistic and potentially 
harmful."

  [Text] Bamako, 11 May (PANA) -- Deadly clashes occurred 
here last night between Republican Guards and students of the 
Bamako Police Academy. The clashes, which involved the use of 
teargas, automatic pistols, and machine guns, resulted in many 
casualties, so far undisclosed, among the fighters and their 
families. The fighting lasted more than three hours, according 
to witnesses. 
  Republican Guards and police trainees undergoing training 
live in two camps in Bamako separated by a common wall. Sources 
say that a Republican Guard, Boubou Sylla, who wanted to take a 
shortcut through the training center, was allegedly molested by 
some student policemen leading to violent reprisals by the 
Republican Guards, who live with their families in their camp. 
However, women and children living on the premises were said to 
have been evacuated in time by paratroopers, who came from their 
quarters 5 km away to separate the fighting groups.

  [Text] The head of state, General Sani Abacha, has said 
that the experience of South Africa, where a democratic 
administration was installed today, is a big lesson for Nigeria. 
He was speaking in an interview with a Radio Nigeria Network 
news correspondent in Pretoria shortly after watching the 
inauguration of Dr. Nelson Mandela. 
  Gen. Abacha stressed that his administration was committed 
and anxious to return the country to democratic rule. He 
reaffirmed the readiness of the government to support the 
transition program with human and material resources to make it 
a huge success. 
  The head of state said that Nigeria's high commissioner to 
South Africa would soon be named. Our correspondent reports 
that already a building has been acquired in Pretoria for use by 
the Nigeria High Commission when established.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Baba Gana Kingibe by </F>
correspondents Dorian Berry and Paul Eylers on the "Good Morning 
South Africa" program; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Berry] I picked up this from 
the news -- I know we were all drinking coffee then, but I 
snatched this item from the news reader in which she read that 
Nigerian military ruler General Sani Abacha says South Africa's 
transition to democracy is a big lesson for Nigeria to restore 
civilian rule, and he said he was committed and anxious to 
return Nigeria to democratic rule. Would you agree with that? 
I think as foreign minister you might have to, but possibly you 
could.... 
  [Kingibe] No, no, I'm not agreeing, just being the foreign 
minister. There is a national consensus about the imperative 
for democracy in Nigeria. There has always been. We have been 
consolidating independence, consolidating democratization over 
time, but there are events which make us return to military rule 
periodically, and we are under military government at this point 
in time, but under a military government committed to 
democratization. Indeed, it has already unfolded a plan of a 
speedy return to democracy in Nigeria. As you quite rightly 
quoted, our head of state said this commitment is not only a 
commitment of the government, but it is a commitment of the 
people. Our transition program has been unfolded, and come 2 
January 1995 there will be full political activity with the 
formation of political parties, to be followed soon by the 
restoration of full democratic government. [passage omitted]

by the Armed Forces Ministry. The National Assembly speaker 
explained that the new military code will fill in gaps 
Senegalese courts had found while trying to implement the French 
military code, which previously had been in force in Senegal. 
The new military code is for Armed Forces' military personnel, 
the paramilitary corps, and those who commit offenses against 
the Armed Forces.

  [Text] Freetown, 11 May (AFP) -- An attack launched on 9 
May by Sierra Leonean rebels of the Revolutionary United Front 
[RUF] against the Bandajuma village (200 km southwest of 
Freetown), left 55 dead among the civilian population. The 
report was made by survivors who witnessed the events in a 
telephone conversation from Bo (40 km north of Bandajuma) where 
they took refuge. 
  This attack brings to 142 the number of people killed (67 
rebels, 65 civilians, and 10 soldiers) since the beginning of 
the month during military operations attributed to the RUF or to 
clashes between the front and the Army. 
  A military spokesman questioned by AFP in Freetown confirmed 
the attack against Bandajuma and said the assailants fled from 
the village "after nine hours of fighting," by Guinean troops 
who are helping government forces fight the rebels. 
  "This attack is the most violent one ever launched during 
the 
last months and we were very surprised by the force of the fire 
of arms still in possession of the rebels," the spokesman said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cuban President Fidel Castro by </F>
correspondent Pieter Theron in Pretoria "yesterday"--recorded, 
Theron's questions in English; Castro's responses in Spanish, 
with English translation of answers by unidentified female 
interpreter and superimposed Afrikaans translation; introduced 
by correspondent Max du Preez on the "Agenda" program] 
  [Text] [Du Preez] One of the many dignitaries at the 
presidential inauguration yesterday who received a rousing 
welcome was President Fidel Castro of Cuba. After years of 
sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro 
arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it 
was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South 
Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an 
extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization, 
nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have 
spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and 
the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony 
and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have 
expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by 
the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized 
that what has taken place over the past few days was without 
doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for 
the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I 
was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take 
with me when I return to Cuba. 
  [Theron] How do you see future relations between South 
Africa 
and Cuba? 
  [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends. 
We are like family. A family does not discuss formal 
relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba 
and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My 
visit has also provided the opportunity for even better 
relations between the two countries in the future. This could 
be of mutual benefit. 
  [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what 
has Cuba got to offer South Africa? 
  [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products 
which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as 
we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost 
anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced 
technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce 
everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our 
two countries. South Africa will play an important role in 
Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many 
years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value 
for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great 
experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to 
succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in 
serious conflicts in many places. 
  [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and 
Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you 
think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took 
place in South Africa? 
  [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices. 
But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's 
knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It 
was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being 
defeated. 
  [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is 
still the right system for Cuba? 
  [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own 
creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed 
in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle 
against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather, 
it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a 
great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the 
things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we 
overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved 
that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own. 
This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point, 
without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops 
almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong 
nation driven by certain principles. 
  [Theron] Will the future system of government still be 
communism for Cuba? 
  [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but 
we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and 
technology, which we now need in order to develop our country. 
So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in 
many areas. There is a process of change under way in our 
country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the 
world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]

has applied for readmission to the Commonwealth after an absence 
of more than 30 years. Pretoria left the organization in 1961, 
following the criticism of its apartheid policies. Commonwealth 
Secretary General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said South Africa was 
expected to rejoin the organization within a few weeks.

  [Text] The minister of Agriculture, Dr. Kraai van Niekerk, 
said the redistribution of land should gain impetus soon, and 
that as part of the process attention is being given to the 
question of finance and the identification of suitable land. 
  Dr. van Niekerk also referred to widespread dissatisfaction 
with the producer price of maize, and said that negotiations 
were taking place with all the role players. He said a solution 
should be reached before the end of next week.

  [Text] The agricultural unions of the Transvaal and 
[Orange] Free State have proposed the establishment of a land 
commission as soon as possible to address problems and fears 
regarding land demands. The presidents of the two unions, Mr. 
Dries Bruwer and Dr. Piet Gouws, say in a joint statement that 
irresponsible land demands by pressure groups such as the 
National Land Committee will deter investigators. They added 
that the new government would also not be able to provide jobs 
if the future of agriculture was not clear. Mr. Bruwer and Dr. 
Gouws were reacting to a warning by the land committee that 
people's expectations regarding land should not be pushed aside. 
The land committee pointed out that the new government could 
expect protest action if land reform did not get immediate 
attention.

  [Text] Pietermaritzburg May 11 SAPA -- Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini welcomed the inauguration of the KwaZulu/Natal 
Parliament in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday [11 May] night as 
the beginning of a new era in his kingdom. But he said it was a 
new start following a sad period of intense political violence. 
  Echoeing the words of the region's Premier Frank Mdlalose, 
the Zulu monarch said differences in political ideas should 
result in healthy debate rather than conflict. "I appeal to you 
to make deliberate plans to bring about peace. Let the 
political violence we have had not spill over into the new era." 
  King Zwelithini also welcomed all people in the province as 
his people, saying: "I love all people created by God in his 
own image." 
  He told the legislature to co-operate and work together for 
the well-being of the people. 
  At a press conference later, the African National Congress 
leader in the Parliament, Jacob Zuma, said his party was 
continuing with legal steps into alleged voting irregularities 
during last month's elections in the province. But he would not 
say whether the ANC was in favour of a re-election in the 
province: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it." 
  Dr Mdlalose also acknowledged that many things had gone 
wrong. Both leaders, however, indicated their willingness to 
work together in the regional government.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 11 SAPA -- The Independent 
Electoral Commission [IEC] is in the process of wrapping up its 
operations and some staff members have already left. IEC 
spokesman Pieter Cronje said on Wednesday [11 May] a better 
indication on how long it would take to wrap up the process 
would probably be determined by Thursday. 
  The IEC would stop working only once its disbanding had been 
proclaimed by the president in the government gazette, he said. 
  The task being tackled at the moment was financial 
reconciliation. The IEC has to submit all its financial records 
to the auditor-general for a final audit as soon as possible. 
Mr Cronje said extra costs incurred after the preliminary 
budget had been released had to be tallied. 
  These costs included spending related to the Inkatha Freedom 
Party's participation in the elections, the extra day of voting 
in some areas and the printing of additional ballot papers. 
"This is a big operation," Mr Cronje said. IEC financial staff 
would probably stay on until the end of the month.

  [Text] Allegations of friction and resignations among the 
PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] top structure following its poor 
showing in the election were denied today by the party's deputy 
president, Mr. Johnson Mlambo. (Arnold Sebetse) spoke to him in 
Johannesburg. 
  [Begin recording, in English] [Mlambo] There is nobody 
resigning from the top structure of the PAC, because rumors have 
been concocted even around the president of the PAC, which have 
no basis whatsoever. Even the question of our secretary general 
has indicated to the leadership that, perhaps because of the 
tasks that he will be handling as our representative in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] parliament, he ought to 
be relieved of his tasks, and we have said no to that aspect. 
[as heard] 
  [(Sebetse)] And finally, Mr. Mlambo, President Mandela has 
made an offer to the PAC, a cabinet post. What is the PAC 
response to that? 
  [Mlambo] Well, the constitution does not allow for that.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 11 SAPA -- Six Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] members were 
sentenced to death on Wednesday for the murder of black people 
at an illegal roadblock on the West Rand last year. 
  They were sentenced in the Rand Supreme Court on four counts 
of murder each, and to an effective 18 years' imprisonment on 
charges including attempted murder, assault and possession of 
unlicensed firearms, SABC [South African Broadcasting 
Corporation] radio reported. 
  Passing judgment, Mr Justice Marais said the sentences 
should 
act as a deterrent to those intent on taking the law into their 
own hands. Those sentenced to death are Petrus Matthews, 
Marthinus van der Schyff, Frederik Badenhorst, Marius Visser, 
Karel Meiring and Andre Visser. 
  A seventh accused, Gerhardus Diederichs, was sentenced to 
seven years in prison for each of the four murder charges, to 
run concurrently, and an effective additional ten years 
imprisonment on a range of other charges.

  [Text] A powerful explosion earlier this evening cut off 
Schweizer-Reneke in North-West Province from the outside world. 
Three electricity substations were set on fire, and according to 
Eskom [Electricity Supply Commission], sabotage cannot be ruled 
out. No one was injured in the explosion, and police will 
continue their investigations at daybreak. One of the fires was 
at Eskom's main substation and the assistance of nearby 
fire-stations was called in. Eskom officials are at the scene, 
and equipment has been ordered from Bloemfontein to restore the 
power supply. The police have cordoned off the area. Local 
telephone exchanges have also been damaged, and power is not 
expected to be restored to Schweizer-Reneke until tomorrow 
afternoon.

[Electricity Supply Commission] transformer in Schweizer-Reneke 
on Wednesday [11 May] night was caused by an electrical fault 
and not sabotage as at first feared, Town Clerk Bertus 
Engelbrecht told SAPA. 
  He said an Eskom transformer failed and a municipal 
transformer was subsequently damaged. "The police routinely 
investigate any explosion, but in this case the problem was an 
electrical one," he said. He said Eskom had by late Wednesday 
night begun repairs and that power to the north west town should 
be restored by Thursday afternoon.

  [Text] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos 
has just returned from South Africa, where he was a guest at 
South African President Nelson Mandela's inauguration. The head 
of state was welcomed at Luanda's international 4 February 
airport by National Assembly Chairman Dr. Franca van Dunem. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] How did you 
find the inauguration ceremony? 
  [Dos Santos] It was a well organized ceremony. It was an 
historic time and many foreign delegations were there. I think 
that South Africa is now entering a new stage in its history. 
Let us hope that the new government will not only respond to 
internal expectations but also to African expectations. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President: Do you think that Portuguese 
President Mario Soares (?can) influence Jonas Savimbi concerning 
peace in this country? 
  [Dos Santos] No, you know full well that the Angolan peace 
process has a well defined framework provided by the Bicesse 
Accord, the relevant UN resolutions, and, eventually, an accord 
that may be signed in Lusaka. I had a meeting with President 
Mario Soares but I only asked him to ask Savimbi what he wants. 
[end recording] 
  The Angolan head of state was also welcomed by Prime 
Minister 
Marcolino Moco, Attorney General Domingos Cololo, and other 
government officials.

  [Excerpts] The new premises of the South African Embassy in 
Angola were inaugurated here in Luanda yesterday. The ceremony, 
full of pomp and circumstance, was attended by many guests. 
Prime Minister Marcolino Moco represented the Angolan 
Government. [passage omitted] 
  South African Ambassador Roger Trammer said a new South 
Africa should encourage stronger bilateral relations. 
  [Begin Trammer recording] The struggle for freedom has been 
won but the struggle continues so we can obtain what freedom 
offers us. We must now forget the past because the future 
beckons. [end recording] 
  Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco said that the victory 
of the African National Congress, ANC, and Nelson Mandela was 
also a victory for Africa, the world, and Angola in particular. 
  [Begin Moco recording] It is in fact a victory for the whole 
of mankind. It is not a victory of blacks over whites, as is 
often said and as has often been said. This has not been a 
victory only for those who were oppressed but also for the 
oppressors. As someone has pointed out, the oppressor also 
suffers. In South Africa for many decades we saw that 
suffering, human degradation, misery, and immorality affected 
everyone to some extent, irrespective of their race, creed, or 
regional background. All Africans of all regions, colors, and 
races felt that suffering. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The fighting is continuing in the country. 
Firmino Lucamba, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
correspondent in Cuanza Norte Province, reports that 
N'dalatando, the provincial capital, was again rocked by violent 
clashes this morning. N'dalatando has become a kind of 
laboratory in which the destructive power of [word indistinct] 
weapons is tested, but the fighting is taking a break at this 
stage. 
  In clashes this morning the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] dropped 
internationally forbidden bombs containing phosphine, a toxic 
product, in addition to napalm and phosphorus bombs. The 
shelling was backed by two PC-7 aircraft, which carried out 13 
air raids. Firmino Lucamba reports: 
  [Begin Lucamba recording] The fighting is continuing in the 
center of the city and it is so fierce it can be compared to the 
fighting during the Second World War. The MPLA-PT (?threw 
everything) [words indistinct] at this stage. What worries the 
local military command most is the fact that the MPLA-PT is 
underhandedly using internationally forbidden weapons such as 
napalm, toxic and phosphorus bombs, as well as (?other types) 
yet to be discovered. The use of those weapons has been 
affecting the people of N'dalatando at large, and pregnant women 
and children in particular. These women and children have been 
receiving treatment at the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola, UNITA, hospital. [passage omitted] [end

Independence of Angola [UNITA] rebels last weekend in clashes 
held on the outskirts of the Quilengues District capital in 
Huila Province. A military source has said three detachments 
consisting of 600 soldiers of Jonas Savimbi attacked the 
Quilengues town in an attempt to occupy it. The Armed Forces 
for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] soldiers clashed with 
government forces in Cunene Province resulting in 6 UNITA 
soldiers killed. The government troops recovered 5 AK-47 
weapons, a 60 mm mortar, and other war materiel.

  [Text] The prime minister, Right Honorable Dr. Ntsu 
Mokhehle, has announced that members of the Royal Lesotho 
Defense Force have been dispatched to all the districts to 
maintain law and order as a result of the strike by members of 
the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police. 
  In a statement released today, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle said that 
the nation should remain calm and not be alarmed by the presence 
of members of the defense force. The prime minister further 
requests the nation to cooperate with the defense force members 
in their effort to protect human life and property, and to 
maintain peace and stability. 
  The striking police have reported that they will not accept 
their monthly salaries at the end of the month, which is on 
Friday next week. In a letter reportedly written to the 
minister of finance, police say they want 60 percent increase 
for police officers, soldiers, and prison officers. They also 
demand a risk allowance increase of 100 percent for the three 
categories. The letter states that the police will not resume 
work before their demands, which include mountain allowance, 
patrol rotation, plain-clothes allowance, and patrol allowance, 
are met. 
  The letter says that police want the Police Order of 1991 to 
be repealed so that their promotions should be controlled by the 
commissioner of police and not the principal secretary of home 
affairs, as they allege is the case now. 
  The strike began yesterday, and reports from different 
districts say police are not working countrywide. The strike by 
members of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police continued throughout 
the country today. Reports of loss of life, looting, and 
destruction of property have been received, and members of the 
Royal Lesotho Defense Force have been deployed to maintain law 
and order. It is reported from Mohale's Hoek that residents 
have taken the initiative to protect property in business 
premises, as it is apparent that looters come from places 
outside the area. 
  The government is appealing to all Basotho to follow this 
initiative and protect business premises in the light of the 
current situation and urges employees to cooperate with their 
employers, as these businesses are to their benefit. 
  The government would like to reassure the business community 
that the situation, which is taken advantage of by criminal 
elements, is now completely under control. It further advises 
that great caution and vigilance should be exercised to curb any 
further activities of this criminal element.

  [Text] The leader of Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance], Mr. Afonso Dhlakama has denied allegations that 
some members of the Malawi Young Pioneers [MYP] movement who 
fled the country during the disarmament process are in some 
Renamo camps in Mozambique. 
  Mr. Dhlakama was speaking in Lilongwe today at the start of 
a 
three-day official visit to Malawi. He explained that all along 
it has not been his movement's intention to interfere in the 
internal affairs of Malawi with the aim of bringing about 
destabilization. Mr. Dhlakama said it was Renamo's wish that the 
transitional process in Malawi should be orderly and peaceful. 
He said while in Malawi he will be holding talks with officials 
of the government and various political parties on topical 
issues, including the current political situation in Mozambique.

  [Text] Malawian Defense Minister General Mponela has been 
in Mozambique since 8 May and has been holding talks with his 
Mozambican counterpart, Army General Alberto Chipande. 
Mozambique and Malawi have agreed to hold the sixth meeting of 
the Joint Defense and Security Commission in Maputo within a few 
days, according to a communique released to the press yesterday 
at the end of a meeting between the Mozambican defense minister 
and his Malawian counterpart. 
  The meeting in the National Defense Ministry allowed the 
Malawian defense minister to get acquainted with the activities 
of the countries' joint commission in his capacity as the new 
co-president of the commission, replacing John Tembo, minister 
of state in the President's Office. 
  During the talks, the Mozambique-Malawi Joint Defense and 
Security Commission reviewed relations between the two countries 
in the military field since the signing of the general 
cooperation agreement in 1984. The two ministers also exchanged 
views on political developments in both countries, after 
welcoming the new nonracial and democratic government in South 
Africa. 
  Meanwhile, the sixth meeting of the Joint Defense and 
Security Commission, scheduled to be held in Maputo soon, may 
discuss such issues as the presence in Mozambique of the Malawi 
Young Pioneers, an armed wing of the ruling Malawi Congress 
Party. Regarding the presence of the Malawi Young Pioneers in 
Mozambique -- which is a serious violation of Mozambican 
territory -- it has been reported that the last session of this 
commission held in February directed military experts from both 
countries to report on the situation for the relevant 
authorities to make their decision on the issue. We also 
learned yesterday that the commission's experts may meet soon, 
before the holding of the sixth meeting of the Mozambique-Malawi 
Joint Defense and Security Commission.

<F P=106> [Article by Orlando Muchanga: "There are still bases"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Xinavane--Residents of some districts of Maputo 
and Gaza Provinces say that former Renamo [Mozambique National 
Resistance] bases still exist. 
  We realized that the movement of people and goods between 
areas controlled by the two sides is still restrained. The 
population in towns are afraid of going far away, and those in 
the rural areas only come to the small urban areas to visit 
families with return travel permits issued by Renamo. 
  Even demobilized Renamo soldiers return to areas under the 
movement's control where they settle themselves. Only in the "3 
February" communal village, in Hlalalene, we met with a Renamo 
demobilized soldier, Eusebio Ernesto Monisse, who really 
returned home, coming from an assembly area in Magude District, 
where he was demobilized on 7 April. [passage omitted] 
  In Manhica town, people still speak of bases such as that of 
Mirona and Macandzene and those of Calanga. Our sources said 
the main Renamo commanders who fought in these areas, such as 
Elias and Agostinho, and "Mabaioneta" himself, have not yet been 
confined in assembly areas. 
  Some of the many hunters, most of whom are without licenses, 
who have been hunting in Magude District's Mapulanguene and 
other areas, assured us that the roads are already in good 
conditions, some Renamo soldiers allow people to hunt there, but 
no one is allowed to come near the Ngungwe base on the border 
with South Africa. 
  One of the hunters said, "We don't know what is hidden 
there". He added that people hunt with AKM's. We also spoke to 
hunters who use traditional weapons, and they gave the same 
information. We learned that there is a similar situation in 
Macalawane, Xivimbanine, Maqueze, Mumbi and Chaimite areas of 
Chibuto District. 
  The head of the Xipadja administrative region in Chibuto, 
who 
is still afraid of revealing his name, told us that in his area, 
the Chindzavane, Macosse, and even Hlanganine bases -- where the 
Renamo assembly area is located -- are still operating. He 
said, "There is still no contact between families residing in 
Renamo areas and those in administrative authorities". 
  More than 50,000 people are currently residing in Xipadja. 
This year they are faced with famine. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] The past five days have seen some of the 
fiercest fighting around the Rwandan capital, Kigali, as the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] forces press their military 
initiatives on the city. Thousands of Kigali residents have 
been trying to make their way out of the capital to safety. The 
small UN force has been unable to broker a cease-fire between 
the two sides and have found it difficult to carry out their 
humanitarian work. There have been increasing calls for the 
Security Council to rethink its policy on Rwanda and commit more 
peacekeepers. Today, the UN commissioner for human rights, Jose 
Ayala Lasso, arrived in Kigali and then set off for the RPF 
headquarters in Buyumba, 65 km away, to meet the RPF leader Paul 
Kagame. Our correspondent, Mark Doyle, accompanied him. He is 
now back in Kigali, and on the line, Robin White asked him how 
easy it was to get to Buyumba: 
  [Begin recording] [Doyle] It is only easy to travel up and 
down if you are with the United Nations, essentially. The 
rebels control most of the road from a point about 5 miles north 
of Kigali. In between that point and Kigali itself I was told 
that there are some government forces. Yes, you can go up and 
down if you are with the United Nations. The United Nations' 
neutrality is still basically respected, and along the way I can 
see that most of the countryside was fairly empty. In fact, 
most of the population are in displaced persons camps. [passage 
omitted] 
  [White] Paul Kagame, what are his military intentions? Did 
you ask him if he is trying to take Kigali now? 
  [Doyle] Yes, if you ask him now, if you say: How long will 
it 
take? he obviously doesn't tell you, but he always seems, he is 
a rather urbane man, and he always seems very calm and even 
perhaps serene, he, sort of, says that we are going to take 
Kigali and then we are going to pursue our other military 
objectives. Obviously, he doesn't say exactly what they are, 
but clearly one of the main ones is to stop the massacres of 
civilians. 
  [White] What did the United Nations want from him? 
  [Doyle] The United Nations have asked if he would accept an 
increased force. Later on today, the UN Security Council in New 
York is intending to vote on whether to increase the force. In 
fact, Mister General Kagame said he accepted the idea of the 
force to give humanitarian aid, but he thought it should only be 
2,500 and he insisted it shouldn't be an intervention force, it 
shouldn't, in any way get in the way of his military activities, 
in other words. [passage omitted] [end recording]

confirmed that he asked Portuguese President Mario Soares to 
talk to Jonas Savimbi. The Angolan president wants to know what 
the UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] 
leader wants and asked Soares to tell Savimbi to speed up the 
Lusaka talks: 
  [Begin dos Santos recording] We did not ask Dr. Mario 
Soares, 
the Portuguese president, to mediate between the Angolan 
president and the UNITA president. We raised a concern that we 
had already raised anyway with the deceased President 
Houphouet-Boigny, which is to find out what Savimbi wanted and 
to try to get out of him what he wants for the war to end in 
Angola. That is all I told Soares. I did not ask him to 
persuade Savimbi to agree to an immediate cease-fire. I will 
repeat that I asked Soares to find out from Savimbi what he 
wants and also asked him, obviously, to advise Savimbi to 
accelerate certain negotiations going on in Lusaka. [end 
recording] 
  That was Jose Eduardo dos Santos talking to Radio Nova.

  [Text] Ndjamena, May 12 (AFP) -- The government of Chad, 
beset with a host of regional rebel movements, has created a 
national reconciliation committee in a bid to secure a lasting 
peace with its armed opposition, officials said Thursday [12 
May]. 
  The 12-member committee was created by a governmental 
decree, 
apparently overriding what informed sources said was resistance 
by Chad's warlord President Idriss Deby to the formation of any 
such body. The decree charged the new commitee with "forming 
contacts and opening dialogue in the country's interior and 
negotiating with political-military groups." 
  The 12-member body has two representatives from the 
government, two from the provisional parliament known as the 
Higher Transitional Council (CST), two from political parties, 
two from human rights associations and four other well-known 
figures. 
  The National Sovereign Conference, a body of various 
political and interest groups set up to chart a new democratic 
constitution and set up an interim government, urged formation 
of a reconciliation committee when it closed work in April 1993. 
  The main armed rebel movements targeted are the National 
Salvation Committee for Peace and Democracy in the south, the 
Chad National Front in the east and the Movement for Democracy 
and Development in the area of Lake Chad. 
  According to former prime minister Fidel Moungar, who was 
chosen by the National Sovereign Conference but later ousted by 
the provisional parliament, Deby wanted to handle rebel matters 
his own way and long resisted forming any reconciliation 
committee. 
  But Moungar noted that the return to Ndjamena of former 
dissident leader Abbas Koty had been negotiated by aides close 
to Colonel Deby without any involvement by the government and 
Koty ended up being killed last October at the time of his 
arrest. 
  The government finally went ahead with the committee's 
creation after its negotiations with the National Salvation 
Commitee in Bangui in February broke down.

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda, there has been a relative lull in the 
battle for control of Kigali this afternoon after a morning of 
mortar fire and bursts of automatic gunfire. [passage omitted] 
  Today, General Bizimungu, the chief of staff of the Rwandan 
Army, warned the United Nations against intervention in Rwanda, 
which would, he said, be comparable to that conducted in 
Somalia, where the UN peacekeeping troops killed and were 
killed, end of quote. I would prefer the matter to be carefully 
examined, added Mr. Bizimungu, expressing the hope that the 
United Nations would not come to drive the knife in further. 
  You may perhaps know that the Security Council in New York 
is 
currently examining the situation in Rwanda, at a time when UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali very recently said that he 
was in favor of the dispatch of a large contingent of UN 
peacekeeping troops to the spot, a prospect which Major General 
Paul Kagame, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] rebel leader, is 
not in favor either. He said so to our correspondent on the 
spot, Jean Helene: 
  [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French 
translation] [passage omitted] I think that achieving a 
cease-fire is a long and exacting task. It is part of the whole 
process. And at the moment when we speak about a cease-fire, 
the other party has a different agenda. We do not recognize 
that government. We would suggest instead a meeting with the 
representatives of the Army, because, in the main, they are the 
ones who are responsible for what is going on, including the 
existence of this so-called government. [end recording]

  [Text] Our special envoy in Rwanda, Jean Helene, met Major 
General Paul Kagame, RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] commander, 
yesterday in Byumba in the north of the country. He asked him 
if he would be in favor of sending foreign troops to Rwanda: 
  [Begin Kagame recording, in English with superimposed French 
translation] We are not bothered about their number; what 
concerns us is their role. We have no problem whatsoever with 
troops being sent here under the aegis of the United Nations or 
any other entity if the intention is to provide humanitarian 
assistance. On the other hand, we don't agree with what some 
call an intervention force. Given the fact that the genocide 
has already taken place with complete impunity, we don't 
understand what the role of an intervention force would be. An 
intervention force would be inappropriate in the current 
circumstances. Such a force would in fact protect those who are 
responsible for the genocide. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report on interview with former Prime Minister Faustin </F>
Twagiramungu by correspondent Marie-France Cros in Brussels; 
date not given] 
  [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu is the prime minister appointed 
by the Arusha peace agreements (August 1993) to lead the 
transitional government in Rwanda. A few hours after the 
assassination of President Habyarimana on the evening of 6 April 
and having learned of the kidnapping by the Presidential Guard 
of several ministers and their families -- all of whom were 
killed -- he sought refuge with one neighbor, while his family 
sought refuge with another. In the morning of 7 April, the Blue 
Helmets came to look for him in armored vehicles, but they did 
not take his family. From 7 to 19 April, Mr. Twagiramungu 
remained on United Nations premises, before being transported -- 
in an armored vehicle and hidden in a jute sack -- to the 
airport and tossed into a plane bound for Nairobi and then 
Brussels. 
<H5>  Illegal </H5>
  On Wednesday [11 May], Mr. Twagiramungu met with Foreign 
Minister Willy Claes. "We agree on the need for a cease-fire 
and the need to say that the hostilities are being aggravated by 
the continued supply of increasingly sophisticated weapons to 
both belligerents." Mr. Twagiramungu supports the RPF, which 
wants to sign a cease-fire agreement only with the Rwandan Army, 
not the government, "because the government has called for 
massacres and because it is illegal. The "president" did not 
even take an oath before parliament and the parties did not give 
their agreement to having their members participate in the 
cabinet, as was the custom when we were still operating under 
the terms of the 1991 constitution," which was claimed by the 
authorities to be the legal basis, in preference to the Arusha 
agreements, which replaced it in 1993. 
  For the time being, the civilian opposition wants to set up 
a 
coordination committee for the democratic forces of change 
bringing together four parties: the Democratic and Republican 
Movement (MDR), the Democratic Socialist Party (PSD), the 
Liberal Party (PL), and the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). 
"Contact must be made with the people by radio. There is a 
terrifying political vacuum. There are only the RPF and the 
killers. This situation is desired by the MRDN [National 
Revolutionary Movement for Development], which wanted to 
annihilate the opposition so that it could be alone in the face 
of the RPF and then exterminate it with the support of the 
people. We cannot tolerate this. The political struggle must 
continue." 
  However, one problem does arise: The MDR is divided between 
those who follow Mr. Twagiramungu and those who, in the name of 
"Hutu Power," have joined the presidential sphere supporters, 
some of whom are currently participating in the massacres of 
civilians. "They fell into the trap of the MRND, which preached 
Hutu unity. I preach Rwandan unity, as is written in our 
bylaws. They did not respect these bylaws, so they can no 
longer be in our party. We need a congress to decide on a clear 
divorce. Under no circumstances may we cooperate with these 
people any more." 
<H5>  Yes To Arusha </H5>
  Mr. Twagiramungu supports "the Arusha peace agreements 100 
percent" but "of course, the killers will have to be excluded 
from the planned institutions and the international community 
must help us judge them." 
  Is the RPF the army of the civilian opposition? "I cannot 
say. I have not talked about this with them. In our agreement 
in Brussels in May and June 1992, we said that we were prepared 
to collaborate with the RPF if it agreed to the negotiations. 
We also said we would undertake the same political struggle: 
Dismantling the dictatorship. We must keep this spirit. When 
the RPF has ended the war -- we do not have weapons to join them 
and put an end to the massacres -- the struggle will still be to 
destroy the dictatorship." 
  And the Rwandan Army? "How can it be described -- it and the 
gendarmerie, both of which have remained on the sidelines 
without defending anyone from the massacres! I condemn the Army 
leadership. If there are officers who are convinced that what is 
happening is evil, then let them fight the militias or, at 
least, keep their distance." 
  What about the MRND? "The militias that kill do so on the 
orders of this party. I think it should be dissolved. We 
cannot keep parties which preach extermination. The MRND 
militants must redefine what they want and choose other leaders. 
Apparently, there are moderates in the MRND. So let them prove 
it by dissociating themselves from the massacres. We cannot 
tolerate letting these people start again some day. I am almost 
50 years old. I have seen violence like this in 1959, 1964, 
1973, 1990, and 1994. Will my children also have to live with 
this all their lives? For 35 years now anytime anyone has 
talked about power it is in Hutu/Tutsi terms. Will we have to 
wait another century to achieve national unity? If the answer 
is yes, then there will never be any development. Never."

<F P=106> [Interview with Rui Oliveira, spokesman for the National </F>
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA, by 
unidentified correspondent in Lisbon; date not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Oliveira] We now have the extremely positive 
experience of all that has happened in South Africa concerning 
the elections. We saw the winning side--the ANC and its leader 
Nelson Mandela--being extremely flexible and inviting 
others--although there were already previous agreements among 
themselves, including the extreme right like the AWB [Afrikaner 
Resistance Movement] and all the other political forces--to be 
part of the national unity government. 
  [Correspondent] Do you believe that such solutions would 
work 
in Angola? 
  [Oliveira] Well, we believe that the South African 
experience 
is extremely positive and, at the end of the day, what has 
happened in South Africa is what we have been negotiating and 
trying to make the Luanda government understand--which is a 
greater flexibility on the part of the MPLA [Popular Movement 
for the Liberation of Angola]. We want, in real terms, an 
administrative decentralization. Angola cannot be ruled from 
Luanda. Therefore, we have been asking right from the beginning 
for governing bodies in those provinces where we won the 
elections. 
  Apart from everything else, it is not possible for the 
ruling 
body of those provinces to include members of a party that 
shelled for a year and a half--and keeps on shelling heavily 
with all types of weapons and from the air, particularly with 
MiGs and Sukhoys--the people of cities where there is no war. 
That is the case in Huambo, Andulo, Vila Nova, and other cities 
that are not on the front line and which the Luanda government 
has been shelling for a year and a half. As I have said, it 
continues shelling those cities. The people living in those 
cities will find it hard to be ruled by those same people. 
  [Correspondent] What is preventing further progress at the 
talks in Lusaka and us from seeing concrete results? 
  [Oliveira] As far as we are concerned, we have been waiting 
to adopt the same measure since we declared a cease-fire for the 
Luanda government. If the Luanda government were to give the 
same response to our cease-fire with a cease-fire command to its 
troops, the Lusaka agreement might have been signed by now. 
  [Correspondent] One last question: Can you see it possible 
for an Eduardo dos Santos-Jonas Savimbi meeting to take place 
through Portuguese mediation, through the mediation of President 
Soares? Do you believe that is possible? 
  [Oliveira] Well, as you know, there have been other 
proposals previously. For example, I can remember initiatives 
by King Hassan II, Nelson Mandela, and the deceased President 
Boigny, who proposed and offered to mediate in the peace process 
in Angola and to promote a meeting between Jose Eduardo dos 
Santos and Jonas Savimbi. We responded positively but the MPLA, 
through its president, refused the meeting. We are totally 
available at present for a meeting at the highest level. Dr. 
Savimbi has already said that it has been the MPLA, the Luanda 
government, that has refused the meeting. 
  [Correspondent] Is Savimbi, therefore, available for a 
meeting with Jose Eduardo dos Santos? 
  [Oliveira] Yes, we are willing to do everything for peace to 
return to Angola. If that initiative comes from someone who 
really wants peace in Angola, be it Dr. Mario Soares, Nelson 
Mandela, King Hassan II, or anyone else, we will respond 
positively at any time. We have already stated this previously.

table tomorrow. Contrary to what had been planned, the document 
drafted by the mediator, regarding the UN role, was not 
discussed today. What is known is that the talks will resume

if the government and UNITA show goodwill, a new UN Angola

  [Text] The Lesotho Government delegation and 
representatives of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police yesterday 
reached an understanding that the police representatives should 
advise the striking police to go back to work and that their 
demand for a 60 percent salary increase was not (?affordable) 
for the government. 
  This follows negotiations between the two sides of the 
strike 
action by Lesotho Police for an increase of 60 percent in 
salaries and 100 percent increase in allowances. Other features 
of the understanding between the two sides were that the issue 
of allowances was already being addressed by the government that 
vehicles at the Ministry of Home Affairs should be returned to 
the ministry. 
  The understanding also noted that representations by the 
police did not accommodate the army and its officials. It was 
agreed that any outstanding issues should be attended to through 
the normal government channels. The negotiations between the 
two sides were held in a very cordial atmosphere.

  [Text] The honorable minister of information and 
broadcasting, Mr. Mpho Malie, today reassured the business 
community, both local and from outside the country, that the 
democratic Government of Lesotho is committed to a free conduct 
of business and investment ventures in the country. 
  In a statement on the present situation following the strike 
action by the police force, the minister addressed the business 
community in particular. He said he did so with great sadness 
that Lesotho once again experienced the present state of 
instability, when neighboring South Africa was taking part in 
the democratic process through which Lesotho had passed. Mr. 
Malie said the Government of Lesotho will make every effort to 
ensure an environment conducive to a free business and 
investment climate in the country. 
  He said the Lesotho Government abhorred in the strongest 
terms the destruction of property and unwarranted intimidation 
that some business persons had endured without the usual 
protection they received from the police. The minister said the 
senseless damage and plundering of business properties which 
took place in the last few days had resulted in the loss of 
invaluable jobs for the people of Lesotho. 
  Mr. Malie appealed to all the communities in the country to 
continue with the spirit of cooperation in the best interests of 
peace, stability, and the maintenance of law and order 
throughout the country.

  [Text] The Right Honorable Prime Minister Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle 
says the Lesotho Government established the Ministry of Defense, 
which will be responsible for all matters relating to the 
Lesotho defense force. He was responding to a question by 
Senator Patrick Motha, who wanted to know how soon would the 
ministry that would deal with the matters relating to the 
Lesotho Defense Force be established. 
  The prime minister said the British Government assisted the 
Government of Lesotho in setting up the Ministry of Defense and 
would send a civilian advisor, who will be in Lesotho for one 
year. He said since the offices of the new ministry have not yet 
been constructed, the ministry will be temporarily accommodated 
at the offices of the Lesotho Tourism Board. 
  The prime minister said for security reasons the number and 
names of the personnel in the Defense Ministry would not be 
disclosed.

Resistance [Renamo], has said he would speak to President of the 
Republic Joaquim Chissano so that his organization may be 
included in future talks between the Mozambican Government and 
Malawian authorities on the issue of the Malawi Young Pioneers 
who entered Mozambique. Dhlakama said only then will Renamo be 
able to explain that the movement is not harboring any Malawian 
Young Pioneers. The Renamo leader was speaking at a news

  [Text] The Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo, 
the Mozambique People's Progress Party, PPPM, and the Mozambican 
National Union, Unamo, say they will boycott the October 
elections if the funds pledged by the United Nations for 
opposition activities are not disbursed. The three parties 
issued a communique accusing UN Secretary General representative 
Aldo Ajello of wanting democracy in Mozambique to depend solely 
on the Mozambique Liberation Front and Mozambique National 
Resistance. Palmo, PPPM, and Unamo say by permitting Aldo 
Ajello to adopt incorrect attitudes, the United Nations does not 
want free and fair elections to be held in Mozambique.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry has issued a statement on 
Eritrea's stance regarding the ongoing war in Yemen. In the 
statement issued this afternoon, the Eritrean Government noted 
with amazement the false information emanating from the media of 
some Arabic countries. The false information alleged that 
Eritrea has taken part in one opposition general's side of [word 
indistinct]. This false information is aimed at spoiling the 
good relationship between Eritrea and all Yemenis, both north 
and south, the statement noted. 
  Today's statement reiterated that Eritrea's stance on the 
Yemeni conflict was clearly expressed in a Foreign Ministry 
statement issued on 5 May 1994. The Eritrean Government noted 
that the ongoing war among the Yemeni brothers was unacceptable 
to the government and again urged both the conflicting Yemeni 
sides to halt the war and solve their problems through dialogue.

  [Excerpts] President Meles returned to Addis Ababa this 
evening, after attending the inaugural ceremony for President 
Nelson Mandela and his two deputy presidents in Pretoria on 10 
May. During his stay in South Africa President Meles held talks 
with the leaders of three countries. Negash Mohamed has the 
details: 
  [Begin Negash recording] [passage omitted] President Meles 
met and held talks with the presidents of Tanzania, Uganda, and 
Sudan. 
  The talks between President Meles Zenawi and Tanzanian 
President Ali Hassan Mwinyi focused on the current situation in 
Rwanda and the problems of the Rwandan people. [passage omitted] 
President Mwinyi briefed his Ethiopian counterpart on the 
efforts he had made and the grim massacres in Rwanda. Mwinyi 
noted that the Rwandan problem is complex and difficult. In 
addition to the serious matter of the refusal of the warring 
factions to mediate, is the fact that Tanzania lacks the means 
to sustain those refugees who have fled to this country. A 
spokesman quoting Mwinyi's statement on this issue told newsmen 
that, though Tanzania believes that the solution to Rwanda's 
problems lies in the hands of Africans, the assistance of the 
international community, and most of all that of the UN, is very 
necessary -- both on humanitarian grounds and because of the 
complexity of the problem. 
  President Meles, who hailed the efforts being made by the 
Tanzanian leader, for his part noted that Ethiopia will make 
every effort to assist Tanzania in finding a peaceful solution 
to the Rwandan problem. President Meles Zenawi, who termed the 
Rwandan massacres as grim and shameful -- not just for Africa 
but for the entire world -- told his Tanzanian counterpart that 
the OAU, the UN and other international organizations and 
countries should share the burden, according to the spokesman. 
  The Rwandan civil strife has claimed the lives of about 
200,000 people in one month. More than one million people have 
fled their country, including about 300,000 who are in Tanzania. 
  President Meles Zenawi's talks with President Yoweri 
Museveni 
of Uganda and the Sudanese leader General 'Umar Hasan al-Bashir 
centered on bilateral relations and the continent's current 
problems. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The government has been losing more than 2.7 
billion shillings annually through ghost workers. The chairman 
of the national payday committee, (Ndugu Mwamba Jingu), said 
that preliminary results have shown the presence of 14,764 ghost 
workers in the civil service. He noted that there were 
possibilities of the number of ghost workers to increase as 
(?reports) of ten accounting officers were until yesterday not 
yet announced. 
  According to (Ndugu Mwamba Njingu), the national payday 
committee has submitted its recommendations to the government 
following the ghost workers' findings. They recommended, among 
other things, that the concerned ghost workers should be deleted 
from the payroll by the end of this month. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] There are reports of top secret discussions being 
held in Algeria between the Malian Government and the Tuareg 
rebels. It seems that there have been problems over an earlier 
agreement between the two sides signed in the Malian capital, 
Bamako, two years ago. Not all Tuaregs, it seems, agree to that 
earlier peace deal which was between the Malian Government and 
the Azaouad rebel movement. The current discussions in Algeria 
are aimed at resolving problems of integrating former Tuareg 
rebels into a unified Malian Army. From Algiers, Mohammed 
Areski Hima faxed this report. 
  The exact location of the meeting between the Azaouad rebel 
movement and the Government of Mali has been kept secret. 
Discussions between the two sides began yesterday under a total 
news blackout. The breakdown of earlier discussions held at 
Tamanrasset in mid-April has prompted both sides to maintain 
secrecy this time. The Tamanrasset meeting was designed to try 
to salvage a peace agreement signed in 1992 in Bamako. This 
peace deal ran into problems over the integration of Azaouad 
fighters into the Malian Army. The Azaouad movement originally 
wanted some 2,300 Tuaregs reintegrated, but the Malian 
Government was expecting to accommodate only 1,000. Since the 
peace deal was signed, only 600 Tuareg fighters have been 
accepted into the Army and the Malian Government says that it 
does not have sufficient funds for any more. 
  The Tuareg groups are also said to be unhappy about 
government funding for social projects in the regions of 
Timbuktu, Kidal, and Gao. Azaouad faces the problem of what 
happens to its fighters if they are left outside the national 
army. Such groups could create insecurity by devoting 
themselves to acts of banditry in the Azaouad Region in northern 
Mali. Even now, disaffected groups of rebels who disapprove of 
the 1992 peace deal are said to be in rebellion against Azaouad.

  [Text] The imminent establishment of diplomatic relations 
between Bamako and Pretoria was confirmed yesterday by President 
Alpha Oumar Konare. He did this upon his return in the early 
evening from South Africa, where he took part in President 
Mandela's inauguration ceremony. Speaking to our special envoy, 
Souleiman Kantara Cissoko, the head of state stressed, above 
all, the special character of the event: 
  [Begin Konare recording] It was a grand and historic event. 
It was the advent of a new state -- a great African state in 
terms of its demographic weight, economic power, strategic 
situation, and human resources. 
  The advent of a new, multiracial, and democratic South 
African Republic is an incontestable sign of democratic progress 
on our continent. I think that nothing will be as before in 
Africa. I consider this a new chance offered our continent, so 
as to assume its responsibilities and become more respected. 
During our stay, we felt the determination of the people and 
leaders of South Africa. You know that our people have always 
been on the side of the South African democrats. It is normal 
for us to be with them today in the construction of a new, 
united, and plural Africa. You know also that this is the 
choice made by Malian democrats. The government has clearly 
indicated in a declaration that henceforth, nothing stands in 
the way of the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
Mali and South Africa. Today, we shall do everything possible 
to make this a reality, especially with the accession of Mandela 
to the presidency of South Africa. [end recording]

  [Text] The Army has confirmed that Cameroon has again 
mounted an aggression on Nigeria on the Bakassi Peninsula. A 
statement by the director of army public relations said that 
while Nigeria had resorted to diplomatic, political, and 
judicial means to resolve the dispute over the peninsula, 
Cameroon had consistently displayed arrogant repression. This, 
it said, had resulted in the death of two Nigerian soldiers 
recently. 
  The statement stressed that despite the provocations, 
Nigerian troops had remained calm, as war is not the only means 
of resolving disputes. While Nigeria continues to pursue a 
peaceful approach, it said that Nigerian troops will continue to 
keep to orders to protect the lives and property of Nigerians 
residing in the disputed area.

Nelson Mandela as president of South Africa is back home. The 
delegation, led by the head of state, General Sani Abacha, 
included two former heads of state. They are: General Yakubu 
Gowon and Alhaji Shehu Shagari. Gen. Abacha held private talks 
with Dr. Mandela and some other African leaders. He told Dr. 
Mandela that Nigeria would cooperate with his administration in 
ensuring that South Africa assumed its rightful position on the 
continent. The head of state said that Nigeria looked forward 
to fruitful economic, social, and diplomatic relations with 
South Africa. Dr. Mandela expressed delight over the existing 
relations between Gen. Abacha and Nigeria's former leaders, 
stressing that such understanding will enhance nation-building. 
  Also yesterday, the head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, held 
talks in Pretoria with some eminent world leaders on the latest 
political developments in the country. They include the vice 
president of the United States, Mr. Al Gore; the British foreign 
secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd; and [word indistinct] African heads 
of state and government. Gen. Abacha used the opportunity to 
brief the leaders on the political and social programs initiated 
by his administration, as well as the progress so far towards 
the commencement of the Constitutional Conference. The British 
foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, who was at the head of his 
country's delegation, told Gen. Abacha that Britain was 
following with interest the efforts of the present government 
and its leader to (?institute) a stable democratic process. He 
assured the head of state of his country's cooperation.

  [Text] The second national conference on the economy ended 
this morning. The 2,000 participants deliberated for two days 
on the consequences of the devaluation and development 
strategies for our economy within a new context. Braimah 
Ouedraogo reports on some of the proposals made by participants: 
  [Ouedraogo] We begin by pointing out that the conclusions 
reached at the end of the deliberations were merely proposals. 
Concerning our membership in the franc zone, it was recommended 
that greater thought should be given to the advantages and 
disadvantages of belonging to such a common monetary outfit. In 
the field of industry, a sector in difficulty and whose 
operators were present throughout the deliberations, the setting 
up of an enterprise promotion fund with special attention to 
women chief executives of enterprises was proposed, as was the 
amendment of the investment code and tax system, and the 
creation of industrial zones with special status. 
  To better sustain agriculture and stockbreeding, a sector 
which benefits greatly from the devaluation, proposals were made 
to create an outfit for the export of livestock and meat, the 
production and export of meat, bring the cost of production of 
rice under control by reducing the cost of inputs. 
  The social sector was not forgotten: It was proposed that 
traditional medicine and drugs should be integrated into the 
health delivery system in order to reduce the adverse effects of 
devaluation on a sector severely hit by poor economic times. To 
better fight against unemployment, it was proposed that 
apprenticeship should be developed for dropout youth, the 
creation of a national council for vocational training. To make 
the transport sector more dynamic, it was recommended that a 
general conference on land transportation should be convened, 
the revision of land transportation agreements signed with 
coastal countries. 
  Finally, the Economic and Social Council was charged with 
monitoring and implementing these proposals so that they become 
actins and not simply words.

  [Text] The president, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John 
Rawlings, returned from Johannesburg after attending ceremonies 
marking the swearing into office of Mr. Nelson Mandela as South 
Africa's first black president, and the ushering in of the 
multiracial and democratic government for the country. 
President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana 
Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr. 
Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V. 
Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni 
Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State; 
and service commanders. 
  Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief 
director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho, 
said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the 
rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over 
wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of 
division. He said the most important lesson that came out of 
the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black 
majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so 
that they can move into the new democratic era in unity. 
  Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings 
seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They 
included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore 
of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife 
of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of 
Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the 
situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade. 
  On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President 
Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to 
commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President 
Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to 
improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho 
said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in 
South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their 
efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on 
the continent.

<F P=106> [Interview with UN General Assembly President Rudy Insanally </F>
by announcer Freek Robinson; place and date not given; on the 
"Agenda" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [Insanally] I am myself personally very optimistic 
that the return of South Africa to the United Nations family 
will be a very easy matter. This is a historic day for which 
the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been 
laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr. 
Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of 
speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the 
United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South 
Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations 
are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once 
more. 
  [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but 
the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of 
South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is 
that the position or not? 
  [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally 
express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that 
that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other 
matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the 
question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all 
countries -- there's a question of a assessment of 
contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have 
to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a 
scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a 
dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United 
Nations Secretariat. 
  [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100 
million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is 
concerned? 
  [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the 
United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an 
important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe 
that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its 
reentry into the organization. Clearly.... 
  [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay 
that amount? 
  [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be 
very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would 
be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me 
say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number 
of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely 
excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has 
to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very 
presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I 
said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some 
arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South 
Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the 
international family. 
  [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South 
Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative 
to remove that? 
  [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and 
again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I 
would think that in so far as it does not affect the general 
purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed 
with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect 
the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council 
will take the necessary measures in that regard. 
  [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the 
Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the 
duties of that particular committee will now lapse. 
  [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was, 
myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was 
one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence, 
although it's left me without a particular job. The same will 
occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said 
we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little 
time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now 
that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations 
family. 
  [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do 
you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that 
body? 
  [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way 
street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key 
role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South 
Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa, 
and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the 
dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in 
the political sense what South Africa has been able to 
accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for 
the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation -- 
that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the 
same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general 
may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we 
can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to 
international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace 
making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of 
the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a 
very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development 
in the continent.

  [Text] South Africa will not immediately join organizations 
such as the Preferential Trade Area [PTA] of East, Central, and 
Southern Africa, and is to provisionally put the emphasis on 
individual neighboring countries. The chief executive of the 
Development Bank of Southern Africa, Mr. Andre le Grange, said 
at a seminar in Nairobi, Kenya, that South Africa was perturbed 
by all these institutions, and that it would pursue bilateral 
agreements with states. Before the elections, the 22 member 
states of the PTA expressed the hope that South Africa would 
play a major role in the area devastated by civil wars and 
famine. However, the Central Bank of Kenya and other business 
leaders have labelled regional integration as a dream.

Professor Jakes Gerwel, is to resign from the university to head 
President Nelson Mandela's Office. The appointment, which has 
not yet been announced officially, was confirmed by ANC sources 
today. Prof. Gerwel will provide a link between Mr. Mandela and 
the outside world and will probably also keep a record of 
cabinet meetings. He is to take the place of the present 
director general of the president's department, Mr. Dave 
Steward, who will now work for Deputy President F. W. de Klerk.

for immediate pension pay-outs have resulted in a statement by 
the ANC that it will honor the rights of individual pension fund 
members, and that it has no intention of interfering with these 
funds. The president of the South African Association of 
Municipal Employees, Mr. Hans Dietliffs, said the ANC would

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  The Rainbow Cabinet -- President Mandela's first Cabinet is 
"a mixed bag," its composition "partly determined by the 
constitutional provision that parties which achieved a specified 
amount of electoral support had to be represented," notes an 
editorial in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 11 May on page 
8. Keeping Keys and Roelf Meyer and the portfolios of the three 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] ministers "strike a good balance," 
while "most interest -- and criticism -- has centered" on ANC 
appointees such as Alfred Nzo and the omission of Cyril 
Ramaphosa. The deputy premiership for the "controversial Winnie 
Mandela is bound to raise hackles in some quarters." The 
"absence" of Freedom Front leader Viljoen and "the entire white 
right is unfortunate." However, the "most pertinent question" is 
how the "rainbow Cabinet" will function. "Winnie Mandela will 
need to co-operate closely with her minister, the IFP's Dr. Ben 
Ngubane. Bantu Holomisa is deputy to Environment Affairs and 
Tourism Minister, Dawie de Villiers. Home Affairs Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi must work together with Public Works' Jeff Radebe, the 
ANC's southern Natal leader and a bitter enemy in the past." 
Were the implications not so serious, it might be said these 
combinations were put together by someone with a fine sense of 
humor. But co-operation at Cabinet level will be vital if the 
new dispensation is to work effectively." Cabinet members and 
their deputies "will have to approach their new roles in the 
spirit of reconciliation so apparent in President Mandela's 
every action since assuming the presidency." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Cabinet of Reconciliation -- "President's Nelson Mandela's 
insistence on Tuesday that the entire nation should give equal 
respect to the two halves of the double-barrelled national 
anthem was yet another symbolic illustration of what is more 
materially apparent in the construction of the Cabinet," begins 
the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 13 May in a page-10 
editorial. "From the perspective of those who may have had 
fears about the future and the ANC's plans for it, Mandela has 
gone far further than could reasonably have been asked of him in 
giving meaning to the concept of reconciliation." Both the 
National Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party have been given 
"more Cabinet posts than their electoral performances entitled 
them to"....and have been given "quality portfolios which should 
build public confidence generally." BUSINESS DAY adds that 
Buthelezi's appointment to a "national rather than regional" 
portfolio is "visionary." The positioning of the ANC's "two 
`unguided missiles' -- Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa" also 
shows "extensive thought." The idea being that they can cause 
less harm inside government than outside. The editorial writes 
that "it seems that reconciliation is a higher priority than 
efficiency and experience." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Foreign Involvement in Ending Apartheid Viewed -- "It was a 
joyous week for all South Africans as we were joined by the 
world in celebrating the inauguration of President Mandela, who 
has over decades come to personify the ideals that so many had 
given up their lives for." So begins the Johannesburg NEW 
NATION in English on 13 May in a page-7 editorial. "However, it 
must be of concern to many that, while statesmen from countries 
to the north of us were acknowledged in as far as they were 
accorded places alongside leaders from Britain and the United 
States, there was no specific mention of the scale of the 
sacrifices that their people made." Angola, Mozambique, Zambia, 
and Tanzania are mentioned, but most the editorial's praise is 
reserved for Cuba. "What needs to be said very forcefully is 
that we might not have been in a position to celebrate a victory 
this week had it not been for the Cubans, who in the spirit of 
internationalism, committed their lives to defeating apartheid's 
defence force at Cuito Cuanavale."

  [Excerpts] The interim president of the Republic today held 
a meeting with officers of Bujumbura garrison. The meeting, 
which was attended by Prime Minister Anatole Kanyenkiko and 
National Defense Minister Lieutenant Colonel Gedeon Fyiroko, was 
on security and the Armed Forces' attitude during the current 
crisis in Burundi. Marie-Josee Niyonzima reports: 
  [Niyonzima] These are the points on which the interim 
president of the Republic's message focused on during the 
meeting with Bujumbura garrison officers: a neutral army, a 
loyal army, an army which guarantees citizens' freedom, the 
creation of an army and a national gendarmerie which reassures 
all the communities in the society. 
  It was his first contact since the death of President 
Cyprien 
Ntaryamira over a month ago. [passage omitted] 
  Regarding the disarming of armed groups in the country, Mr. 
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya once again issued directives. 
  [Begin Ntibantunganya recording] Regarding the armed groups 
who are an obstacle to security in the country, the government 
cannot accept the emergence of secret armed groups inside the 
country. The government urges the national Armed Forces to 
combat them and asks them to adhere to discipline and loyalty 
towards the government's decision on disarmament. We, however, 
remind the Armed Forces that in this operation they must 
scrupulously respect the directives of the commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces which are as follows: 
  First, the disarmament operation must be carefully prepared 
to prevent any problems. It must be conducted in close 
cooperation with the local administrative authorities to avoid 
any human or material damage. [passage indistinct] Fourth and 
last, we must keep in mind that disarmament is not an end in 
itself, but rather a precondition for peace and security to be 
undertaken through a plan as yet undefined and a study of how to 
tackle the following essential issue (?often used) as alibis for 
certain actions: opening up and extending the armed forces to 
all the ethnic components of our country. [passage indistinct]

  [Excerpt] ... The third item on the agenda of the weekly 
ministerial meeting was on the assessment of the operation of 
restoring peace and security and was presented by the minister 
of territorial administration. 
  Regarding the Bujumbura mayorship, he noted that the 
recently 
conducted disarmament operation in the suburbs north of the 
Ntahangwa River restored a certain calm. It created conditions 
for the return of peace which can be seen in the return of the 
people to their homes, busy marketplaces, notably those of 
Kinama and Gasenyi, as well as the reopening of schools. 
  The minister of territorial administration, however, 
indicated that some areas were still faced with overcrowding due 
to the problem of displaced people, and that with the outbreak 
of cholera the situation might worsen. The meeting called on 
the government to take swift measures in time to deal with the 
problem and also to convince the displaced people to reintegrate 
into their respective areas. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu, the Rwandan prime 
minister-designate, who was due to take up his position after 
implementation of the Arusha agreement, is currently in Europe 
trying to see if it is possible for him to play a role in this 
Rwandan crisis. Faustin Twagiramungu explained to correspondent 
Monique Mas that he hopes the opposition forces will meet and 
work together: 
  [Begin recording] [Twagiramungu] We are in contact with 
those 
who have remained in Rwanda in the liberated areas, as well as 
with those who are in Brussels. Therefore, we think that it is 
absolutely necessary to set up a coordination committee formed 
by all these forces and to try to act and do something so the 
Rwandan people know that the opposition still exists and intends 
to carry out its activities and assume its responsibility as an 
alternative to the regime. 
  [Mas] Do you believe in a military solution to the Rwandan 
problem? 
  [Twagiramungu] The military solution can be looked at from 
one angle. What we say today is that the army and the 
gendarmerie commands failed to put an end to the massacres 
perpetrated throughout the country. If this situation 
continues, it is obvious that all political forces and military 
forces that are able to introduce change and improve the 
situation will be absolutely welcome. [end recording]

  [Text] Faustin Twagiramungu, Rwanda's prime 
minister-designate appointed by the Arusha agreements, has made 
his voice heard once again from his exile in Brussels. 
Furthermore, he has been received by Belgian Foreign Minister 
Willy Claes. He wants a coordinating committee of the 
Democratic Forces for Change to be established, and he explained 
to Monique Mas what he expects from the international community: 
  [Begin Twagiramungu recording] The international community 
should first of all help us -- and at all cost -- to establish 
an international tribunal to try the criminals and the 
perpetrators of the crimes and massacres which have been carried 
out in Rwanda from 6 April up to the present day. Second, we 
have to try to create authorities for the protection of refugees 
and also to ensure their safety within the framework of the 
supply of food aid. The role which UNAMIR plays, for example, 
should be redefined, and if there is any question of another 
force, then this force should be in a position to protect the 
refugees, so that they cannot be attacked by other forces, such 
as the militias, for example. 
  As for the genocide, we cannot mix up the war and the 
massacres. The massacres which have been ordered in Rwanda quite 
clearly differ from the war, and I must specify that this war is 
the result of the massacres. Here I differ quite frankly with 
those who claim that it is the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] 
which brought about the resumption of hostilities. [end

  [Excerpts] In Rwanda the Rwandan Patrotic Front [RPF] is 
advancing toward Gitarama, south of Kigali. [passage omitted] 
  The RPF would be happy to see a humanitarian force which 
would be tasked with establishing security zones in the east and 
south of the country, but the Front rebels will not hear of an 
intervention force to halt the fighting. 
  Faustin Twagiramungu, a Hutu member of the opposition, who 
should have become prime minister in the framework of the Arusha 
peace agreement, agrees with this. He was the guest on our 
magazine programme at 0820. Francois Rijkmans asked him what he 
wants from the West: 
  [Begin Twagiramungu recording] They can do a lot. For 
example, first by stopping the massacres, by putting pressure on 
the clique which is currently massacring people. And second, by 
giving substantial aid to the survivors, to the refugees. And 
third, by helping to ensure that (?this force can come), with a 
[word indistinct] redefinition of its mandate, as part of 
humanitarian aid, because aid is needed both in the zones 
occupied by the RPF and in the zones that are not occupied by 
the RPF. There are unfortunate victims everywhere in both these 
cases. [end recording]

  [Text] President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire has been meeting 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] officials to discuss the 
unilateral cease-fire document that has been signed by the 
illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF officials, Titus 
Rutaremara and Dr. Butera Jean Bosco, refused to countersign the 
document because, though the document had been signed by army 
officers, they have signed it on behalf of the Government of 
Rwanda, which the RPF does not recognize. 
  The unilateral cease-fire document by the Rwandese 
Government 
was signed by Army officers on behalf of the government, because 
President Mobutu had refused the government officials themselves 
to sign the agreement, knowing that the RPF would not accept it. 
  After the RPF officials refused to countersign the 
cease-fire 
document, President Mobutu suggested that a new document be 
prepared in which the part to be signed by the Rwandese 
Government was to be replaced by a part that will be signed by 
the Army officers of the Rwandese Government forces. 
  The RPF officials accepted these proposals of a cease-fire 
arrangement between the RPF and the Rwandese Government forces. 
The RPF has always rejected any talks with the illegitimate 
government in Rwanda, but the front has always invited the 
Rwandese Government forces for talks aimed at stopping the 
military hostilities between the two sides.

  [Text] There are reports that Republican National Movement 
for Democracy and Development [MRND] militias have been 
infiltrating into countries neighboring Rwanda, with the mission 
of exterminating Rwandese refugees in those countries. All the 
countries neighboring Rwanda are hosts to millions of Rwandese 
refugees. Burundi, Zaire, Uganda and Tanzania have hosted 
millions of Rwandese refugees for a long time. This mission to 
exterminate Rwandese refugees in neighboring countries is more 
likely to succeed in countries where the refugees live in areas 
that are easily accessible from the Rwandan border. The UNHCR 
should take appropriate measures to preempt this impending 
catastrophe, otherwise they may start reacting when the 
situation is out of control.

  [Text] Reports from inside Tanzania tell us that Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] 
youth-wingers have been separated from the rest of the refugees 
and given a separate refugee camp, and some who have been 
directly accused of committing atrocities have been arrested and 
are now waiting for trial. This is a necessary step that has 
been taken by Tanzanian Government, because the youth-wingers 
have been committing atrocities against humanity, and should be 
arrested anywhere in the world. Apart from this, the 
youth-wingers are murderers who pose security risks to other 
Rwandese refugees in Tanzania, and security risks to the entire 
nation of Tanzania.

  [Excerpts] According to our correspondent in Kibungo, 
(Nyierigira Mutaburuka), refugees have been returning home all 
day. [passage omitted] We have also learned that, during this 
process of refugees returning from Tanzania, local authorities 
in Tanzania held those persons who had taken part in massacres 
in detention centers. Detentions also should be carried out in 
other neighboring countries, notably in Zaire, where there are 
Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development, 
MRND, militia, [Interahamwe] ready to massacre those Rwandan 
refugees who have settled there. 
  Indeed, a considerable number of Coalition for the Defense 
of 
the Republic militiamen have gone to Zaire via the border town 
of Goma, with a plan similar to the one which was just 
implemented in Rwanda: To exterminate anyone whom the puppet 
Gitarama government does not want to see alive. This question 
concerns Rwandan refugees, but also others living in Zaire, 
notably in the Masisi, Walikale and Rutshuru zones of the Goma 
subregion. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] The UN high commissioner for human rights, Mr. 
Jose Ayala Lasso, has been in our country since the day before 
yesterday. He has come to Rwanda to gather information on the 
development of the situation -- in particular the massacres -- 
and to seek possible solutions to that problem. 
  He had the opportunity to hold talks with certain government 
military leaders, including the chief of general staff and the 
principal private secretary at the Defense Ministry. Their 
talks touched on the issue of those people now taking refuge in 
certain buildings in Kigali, which are surrounded by Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] militia, 
notably the Hotel Des Milles Collines, the (Amohoro) hotel, and 
King Faisal hospital. The government military leaders, among 
them Chief of Staff [COS] Colonel Augustin Bizimungu, reportedly 
promised Mr. Ayala Lasso that they would facilitate the 
liberation of these people -- but undoubtedly this promise will 
not be translated into reality, given the statements made by 
this same government army COS this morning on Radio France 
Internationale. When RFI correspondents asked him what the 
soldiers needed to neutralize the MRND militia [Interahamwe] so 
as to prevent the massacre of innocent people, Colonel Bizimungu 
answered that it was a lack of soldiers, given that the soldiers 
were busy repulsing the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA]. [passage

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA] has confirmed its 
advance. On the frontlines, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] 
has shown that it is making progress. Today the RPA captured 
Gako Camp in the Bugesera region. This occurred after prolonged 
fighting, and the occupation of a large amount of territory. 
The RPA controls Byumba Prefecture, Kibungo Prefecture, 
three-quarters of Kigali Prefecture, and half of Ruhengeri 
Prefecture. In short, the RPF controls more than half of the 
country. 
  Fighting is now taking place in Bugesera region in southern 
Rwanda, which is very close to the border with northern Burundi. 
  In Kigali itself the RPF controls the northern part of the 
town [words indistinct] southern part of the town. 
  The liberation of the country is thus already a reality for 
the people. However, each Rwandan is still expected to 
contribute to that liberation by supporting the RPF combatants, 
and all those acting to help rid the country of the current 
dictatorship.

  [Text] ... (?Government) forces have been destroying 
bridges in an attempt to slow down the advance of the Rwandan 
Patriotic Army, especially in the southern part of the country. 
Two bridges have been destroyed, one at Gashora on the road 
from Bugesera to Butare and the other bridge across the River 
Nyabarongo on the road to Gitarama. The Rwandese Patriotic 
Front [RPF] now controls more than half of the country and this 
includes the entire borderline with Uganda, the borderline with 
Tanzania and a big part of the Rwanda borderline with Burundi. 
The current RPF military offensive is intended to stop the 
massacres by the illegitimate government in Rwanda, using the 
army and the Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development militia. The massacres have claimed more than 
300,000 people, opposition officials and people of Tutsi origin.

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 15 (AFP) -- Fighting between 
Rwandan rebels and government forces intensified Sunday [15 May] 
in several districts of Kigali and in towns across the country, 
a UN spokesman in the capital said. Abdul Kabia, contacted by 
telephone from Nairobi, reported heavy clashes between the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and government troops in the 
eastern and southeastern suburbs of Remera and Kicukiro. Mortar 
shells also fell in the centre of the capital, he said. 
  Fighting between the Tutsi-led RPF and the Hutu-majority 
government side was also raging in Ruhengeri, a northwest town 
still held by the regular army, and at Nkumba further to the 
north, Kabia said. Clashes were also reported at Bugesera, 
south of Kigali. 
  The RPF claimed on Friday it had seized control of half the 
country. [passage omitted] 
  Although the capital's streets are no longer littered with 
corpses, observers say that civilians trapped there now face a 
war of attrition where weapons, rather than political dialogue, 
will have the ultimate say. 
  General Romeo Dallaire, head of the UN assistance mission in 
Rwanda, said the RPF, made up of soldiers trained in guerrilla 
warfare, realizes it stands to lose too much in an all-out 
assault on Kigali and has thus adopted a tactic of "isolation, 
harassment and infiltration." He said that by progressively 
wearing down their enemies, the rebels, who control large chunks 
of the northern and eastern parts of the country, hope to be 
able to tighten their stranglehold around Kigali by gaining 
ground from the southeast before launching a final assault. 
  The RPF has been ransacking military bases, fighting for 
control of the road leading to the capital's airport, and 
lobbing mortars on the city centre where officials building are 
located. But some of the mortars, either accidentally or 
intentionally, have fallen on city streets or refugee centres, 
terrorising civilians already struggling to survive on little 
water and food. 
  Meanwhile Dallaire is trying to broker a ceasefire among the 
warring parties while the UN Security Council is to vote next 
week on sending UN reinforcements to the war-ravaged country. 
  The UN High Commissioner for Human Right, Jose Ayala Lasso, 
who visited Kigali last week, made an impassioned plea Friday 
for the world to end the "unimaginable human tragedy" in Rwanda. 
"The world must do something to halt this violence," Ayala said.

and massacres, a war of attrition seems to be under way in 
Kigali. [passage omitted] 
  Atrocities and massacres are being confirmed, and they 
affect 
the whole country. A Swiss businessman who lived in Butare in 
the south of Rwanda told how he saw men, women, and children 
thrown alive into a pit full of burning tires. There had been 
no problem between Hutu and Tutsi in Butare, he said, but 
everything started with the arrival of the presidential guard.

  [Excerpt] The Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] forces control 
the entire Byumba Prefecture, the entire Prefecture of Kibungo, 
about three quarters of of the Kigali Prefecture, and it 
controls half the Ruhengeri Prefecture. 
  This is the part of the country that has already been 
snatched from the clique of leaders and their stooges: the 
presidential guards, the [Coalition for the defense of the 
republic militia, [Interahamwe], and the Revolutionary National 
Movement for Democracy and Development militia, Impuzamugambi. 
As for the rest of the country, it will not take long. Let 
them be strong. 
  As for Kigali town, the rebels control northern, eastern, 
and 
southeastern parts. Fighting is taking place around Ruhengeri. 
In the south of the country, fighting took place in the 
southern part of Bugesera and now the military barracks of the 
region has fallen to the rebels who now control it. [passage

  [Excerpt] We have said that the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] cannot accept France taking part again militarily in an 
operation in Rwanda in any capacity whatsoever. 
  The behavior of the French Government in the Rwandan affair 
is so well known that it is almost impossible for France to 
envisage (?deploying) its troops in our country. The French 
Government has never stopped supporting those who committed the 
atrocities which erupted and continue in Rwanda, mainly by 
remaining silent. This is a conniving silence in the face of 
all the massacres which destroyed and still destroy human lives 
in Rwanda, particularly since the beginning of the war in 1990, 
through its military support in terms of men and weapons. A 
large quantity of weapons deployed to exterminate the Rwandan 
population has been provided by France to the bloody Kigali 
regime. France also gave intensive military training to 
Presidential Guards and to Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development-Coalition for the Defense of the 
Republic militias which have caused such misery to befall the 
Rwandan population. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Jose Ayala Lasso, the high commissioner for 
human rights [name and title as received], visited the Rwandan 
capital Kigali this week. During his visit he held talks with 
the rebel leader, Paul Kagame, and met senior army and 
government officials. Jose Ayala Lasso succeeded in obtaining 
the commitment of the various parties to enable the departure of 
the 20,000 civilians who detained like hostages at Kigali's 
stadium or at the Mille Collines Hotel. Assane Diop asked Jose 
Ayala Lasso where these civilians could take refuge if these 
commitments were respected: 
  [Begin recording] [Lasso] This will have to be one of the 
factors under consideration since they will not only need 
guarantees concerning their personal safety to leave, but they 
will also have to go to a place where they will be safe. All 
this must be considered, assessed, planned, and implemented. 
  [Diop] Would it be in Rwanda or in neighboring countries? 
  [Lasso] This will depend on these people. Some want to leave 
for a foreign country. However, all this must be assessed in 
conjunction with the means at our disposal to guarantee safety, 
and also with the possibility to move within the country. 
  [Diop] Would the United Nations be ready to pay for the 
costs 
of displacing so many people inside or outside Rwanda? 
  [Lasso] I have no doubt that the high commissioner for 
refugees or other UN agencies will be able to support this 
scheme. [passage omitted] 
  [Diop] Beyond obtaining the freedom of these hostages you 
have also attempted to obtain a cease-fire. You have met senior 
Rwandan military and government officials, did you also meet 
senior RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] officials? 
  [Lasso] I met General Kagame of the RPF. I did not go there 
with the idea to negotiate or to put forward a cease-fire. I 
went there to bring my message as high commissioner for human 
rights, that is: Stop the violence, respect the rights of all 
and everyone. Obviously, all this is closely tied to the 
cease-fire and it is only for this and in this context that I 
said that it was necessary for both parties to take measures to 
reach an agreement for a cease- fire. 
  [Diop] Did the rebels commit themselves to sparing lives? 
  [Lasso] The rebels say that a cease-fire does not 
necessarily 
imply an end to the violence, because massacres have gone on 
even during the cease-fire. They believe that the cease-fire 
must be included in a process that should, first, be aimed at 
ending violence. Naturally when they say that, they are 
accusing the other party. The same position, with some slightly 
different nuances, is being held by government soldiers.

  [Excerpt] Kigali, May 14 (AFP) -- The UN mission here hit 
out Saturday [14 May] at United Nations Security Council delays 
in deploying fresh troops in Rwanda, as the corpses of thousands 
of victims of the country's ethnic bloodbath surfaced in 
neighbouring Uganda. "A single day's delay is one day too 
much," said Moctar Gueye, a spokesman for the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) in the capital. 
  Reduced from 2,500 to around 400, the mission has become 
powerless to prevent continuation of the carnage which aid 
agencies estimate has claimed at least 200,000 lives in little 
more than five weeks. On Friday in New York the Security 
Council postponed until next week a vote on the planned 
deployment of 5,500 additional UN troops. But Gueye added that 
he was hopeful that, once authorised, the reinforcements would 
be capable of intervening to help secure an end to the 
bloodletting. 
  Meanwhile sporadic bursts of heavy weapons continued in the 
Rwandan capital Saturday as rebels fighters battled government 
troops for control of the city, Gueye said. The exchanges 
between rebels of the mainly minority Tutsi Rwanda Patriotic 
Front (RPF) and the Hutu-dominated government forces, were 
limited to small arms fire during the afternoon, Gueye said, 
adding: "The calm will not last." 
  Separately, health officials in Kampala said Saturday that 
Ugandans living on the shores of Lake Victoria had had to bury 
thousands of corpses flowing into the lake from Rwanda though 
the River Kagera. The officials warned that unless the mass 
burials were expedited, epidemics could break out as mutilated, 
decomposing bodies continued to flood in. 
  Ugandan villagers have buried an estimated 26,000 bodies 
recovered from the lake during the past three weeks, said 
Emmanuel Pinto, a deputy from western Uganda. 
  The official NEW VISION newspaper reported on Friday that 
bodies were arriving at the rate of 1,600 daily. The UN World 
Health Organisation has supplied villagers with grave digging 
tools to speed up the macabre exercise. 
  Earlier Saturday in Kigali, former French minister for 
humanitarian action Bernard Kouchner called on the international 
community to help avert "genocide" in the country. "We cannot 
stand by and let genocide be perpetrated," said Kouchner, a 
doctor who founded the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres 
and who arrived here on Thursday and spent Friday touring 
orphanages and camps for people made homeless by the conflict. 
  The UN Security Council postponed action on the Rwanda 
proposal until early next week after around four hours of 
discussions. 
  British ambassador to the United Nations, Sir David Hannay, 
stressed all delegates were aware of the urgency of the 
situation, but a US diplomat said he believed Washington had not 
received sufficient details on where the reinforcements would be 
deployed. 
  Diplomatic sources said there were unconfirmed reports that 
the force would be composed of troops from Australia, Ghana, 
Nigeria, Senegal and Tanzania, would include 800 troops deployed 
in Kigali to protect the airport and other key sites. 
Government sources in Canberra said Saturday that at least 10 
western countries, mostly European but including Australia, had 
been asked to make a contribution to the new force. [passage

  [Excerpts] No one knows how many people have been massacred 
in Rwanda. [passage omitted] The militiamen of the former 
single party in Rwanda, the Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development [MRNDD], the late President 
Habyarimana's party, are considered to be largely to blame for 
these massacres. Their leader is Robert Kadjuga; he is 
president of this militia, called the Interahamwe. Our reporter 
Jean Helene has met him and Kadjuga says he has had enough of 
these accusations. The massacres, the genocide, all these are 
the results of fate rather than of some deliberate plan: 
  [Begin recording] [Kadjuga] They are not organized; no way, 
no way, no way. You have to see the situation: the president 
died, and after three hours, the population really did not 
understand what was going on. They saw their neighbors next 
door who had guns to kill everyone; well, they just defended 
themselves. 
  [Helene] Are you collaborating with the army in this form of 
civilian defense? 
  [Kadjuga] Well, we just exchange some advice. Otherwise, 
there really is no regular contact with the army. We are just 
doing our best not to disturb the army. If the army asks us to 
leave a spot, we leave it, but we help the army to defend the 
country. 
  [Helene] Do you send your members to the front? 
  [Kadjuga] Sometimes, because there are sectors where the RPF 
[Rwandan Patriotic Front] wants to go but the population does 
not want this, so I could describe this as the front. So, if 
you like, if the RPF is in this sector, and if our people are 
there, then they fight. We are going to fight to prevent the 
RPF from taking Kigali. We're quite sure of that. We'd rather 
die. [end recording]

  [Text] Sao Tome, 13 May (AFP) -- Sao Tomean President 
Miguel Trovoada announced upon his return from South Africa that 
Sao Tome and Principe and South Africa have established 
diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level. The president 
had been attending President Nelson Mandela's inauguration. 
  "We always fought the apartheid regime, and so after these 
first free and multiracial elections in South Africa we can 
henceforth establish diplomatic relations with that country," 
Mr. Trovoada told journalists. The agreement was signed on 10 
May in Libreville between Hurbino Botelho, the Sao Tomean charge 
d'affaires, and South African Ambassador Willem Steenkamp. 
  President Trovoada also stated that during his visit in 
Pretoria he held discussions with the presidents of the other 
four African Portuguese-speaking countries, with whom he 
examined the sociopolitical situation prevailing in the five 
African Portuguese-speaking countries.

to the Somali refugees in Yemen who he said are experiencing a 
horrible situation. The spokesman said over 400 Somali refugees 
had been killed in the ongoing civil war in Yemen. He appealed 
to relief agencies to evacuate the refugees and bring them back 
to Somalia or take them to any other destination they wanted to 
go. The senior spokesman of the SNA said the refugees needed 
urgent assistance such as the provision of food, medicine, 
shelter, and (?protection). In conclusion, he called on our 
warring Yemeni brothers to stop fighting and resolve the 
conflict through dialogue.

  A senior aid official who in the past had given a figure of 
20,000, said he believed up to half a million people had died 
since the start of the current fighting at the beginning of 
April. Other reports say the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front, the 
RPF, has expressed support for the idea of a UN humanitarian 
force in Rwanda but says it should be smaller than the one 
proposed by the world body. The RPF said Rwanda's neighbors and 
any country that had backed the government in Kigali should be 
excluded from the force. The guerrilla group also stressed it 
will not abandon the strategic positions under its control.

  [Excerpt] Amid reports of continuing shelling between 
Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] fighters and government troops in 
Kigali and the killing of 80 [as heard] school girls in Rwanda, 
120 Tanzanians have arrived in the country from Rwanda via 
Burundi. The 120 Tanzanians, including 40 children, met the 
Ngara district commissioner, Ndugu Jonah Mwakishomba, who was at 
Kabungo on the Burundi border on other business. 
  The Tanzanians led by the secretary of the Tanzanian 
community in Rwanda, Brother Ramadhani Hamza Tisiime, told the 
district commissioner of the suffering they experienced in 
Rwanda before their departure via Burundi. The Tanzanians, who 
arrived in Tanzania in a freight truck flying the Tanzanian 
flag, and five private cars are travelling to Mwanza where they 
hope to meet the regional commissioner. They plan to present 
the commissioner with the national flag which was removed from 
the Tanzanian Embassy in Kigali and is now flying on the truck. 
  The embassy in Kigali was closed many days ago. The 
Tanzanians say they stayed outside the embassy in the sun and 
rain without getting any assistance from the Rwandans who 
claimed that President Habyarimana had been killed on his way 
from Tanzania and therefore they should fend for themselves. 
One woman told the Ngara district commissioner that she had 
been on a visit to Kigali and had left her residence for a short 
time. When she returned she found that all the Tanzanians in 
the house had been killed by government troops and government 
militia. The Tanzanians related that on their way home, they 
received some assistance from RPF fighters. 
  They also said there are 40 other Tanzanians at the embassy 
in Kigali without food who need assistance from the government 
of Tanzania. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Efforts to evacuate Tanzanian nationals in Rwanda 
continue. The government said it was making further efforts to 
repatriate 40 Tanzanian nationals who have been stranded in 
Rwanda following intensified ethnic clashes. Speaking in a 
telephone interview yesterday following reports that 40 
Tanzanians were stranded in offices previously used by 
Tanzania's diplomatic mission in Rwanda, the permanent secretary 
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International 
Cooperation, Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha, said the government had 
already made contacts with various NGO's, including the Red 
Cross, asking them to provide assistance in the form of food and 
medicines to the Tanzanians. 
  Besides this, the government has also contacted the French 
and Belgian Embassies in Rwanda to look into the possibility of 
transporting the Tanzanians by road. More than 40 national 
flags were sent to Rwanda the day before yesterday to be used by 
vehicles that would provide transport to the Tanzanians.

  [Excerpts] A total of 64 assorted firearms, including 389 
rounds of ammunition, have been surrendered to police in Ngara 
District, Kagera Region by soldiers of the Rwandan Army who are 
fleeing the fighting in their country and entering Tanzania 
following the outbreak of civil war early last month. This was 
said by the Kagera Region commissioner, Honorable Philip 
Mangula, when he briefed the deputy prime minister and minister 
of home affairs, Hon. Augustine Mrema on the situation of the 
Rwandan refugees in (Kasulo) camp, Ngara District. The Hon. 
Mrema, who is in Ngara to study the situation of the Rwandan 
refugees, phoned Radio Tanzania this evening and said that the 
weapons included an (FMG)-16 gun, eight pistols, and 30 
grenades. [passage omitted] 
  Hon. Mrema said the (Kasulo) refugee camp has already 
received 270,000 registered refugees though it is estimated that 
their total number is 350,000. The camp is said to be the 
biggest refugee camp in the world.

  [Text] There has been a new influx of Rwandan refugees, 
most of them Hutus, across the border with Tanzania. Reports 
from there say about 13,000 people had set up temporary homes 
which are believed to be about 40 km from the main Rwandan 
refugee camps. 
  Many of the Hutus are said to have fled from atrocities 
committed by the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] which is mostly 
Tutsi. The reports add that RPF soldiers were killing many 
people and burning down houses during the advance. The RPF, 
which now controls much of eastern Rwanda, has denied the 
systematic killing of civilians.

  [Text] The highlight of this morning is the resumption of 
the consultations between the government and the labor unions. 
The meeting was convened to present the government's responses 
to workers' demands contained in the memorandum submitted to the 
prime minister by the labor unions on 1 May. Here is Braimah 
Ouedraogo with a report. 
  [Ouedraogo] A pay rise is out of the question. According to 
the explanations of the budget minister, an increase of 40 to 50 
percent will result in a budget deficit of 93 billion and 97 
billion respectively. Therefore, there are no funds to finance 
such a pay rise. Fuel prices cannot also be reduced since they 
are no longer standardized. 
  The commerce, industry, and mines minister, who was present, 
talked about the establishment of a market street which would 
enable small traders to obtain cheap stalls. He also talked 
about the National Grains Office [OFNACER] and the Faso Yaar 
[state-owned marketing organization]. OFNACER has already been 
liquidated and the minister assured consumers in high-risk areas 
that cereal shortages could be covered by SONAGES [expansion 
unknown]. However, the Faso Yaar could not be rehabilitated 
despite the unions' demands. This is a sector that the state 
has transferred to the private sector in order to make it more 
efficient. The state is reported to have lost more than 6 
billion CFA francs in organizations such the Faso Yaar. 
  Finally, concerning pharmaceuticals, the health minister 
outlined a number of measures taken to protect people's pockets. 
These include negotiations with the French Pharmaceutical 
Producers Union for the latter to reduce wholesale prices. With 
the 2 billion granted by France as post-devaluation subsidy for 
pharmaceutical imports, there are plans for price cuts of 20 to 
25 percent in the next few days. The health minister promised 
to reduce the number of pharmaceutical importers, which should 
lead to a considerable reduction in retail prices for the people.

  [Text] Monrovia, 13 May (AFP) -- No negotiations have been 
planned between the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], 
the main armed faction in Liberia, and the Liberian Peace 
Council [LPC], an armed militia which has been harassing the 
NPFL for over eight months in the southwest of the country, an 
NPFL spokesman in Monrovia, John Richardson, told AFP today. 
  The beginning of discussions this week between the front and 
the LPC was announced on 6 May by the transitional government's 
information minister, Joe Mulbah, a former NPFL spokesman. 
  "We were not informed of this decision. Meeting the LPC 
would be tantamount to recognizing it. This would only 
encourage the formation of other armed groups," Mr. Richardson 
said. 
  Formed in 1993, the LPC is not a signatory to the peace 
accords concluded two months earlier between the NPFL; the 
United Liberation Movement [ULIMO], an armed faction; and the 
former Interim Government of National Unity [IGNU]; to put an 
end to the civil war that has been going on since December 1989. 
  Following these accords, a presidential council, a 
government, and a transitional asssembly were set up with the 
participation of the three factions that signed the accords. 
  The disarmament of all the combatants, which should have 
taken place simultaneously, was suspended due to persistent 
confrontations between the NPFL and the LPC on the one hand, and 
rival ethnic clans within ULIMO on the other. 
  Mr. Richardson confirmed today that the NPFL had "stopped 
disarming, owing to the inability of the Economic Community of 
West African Cease-Fire Monitoring Group [ECOMOG] to stop the 
fighting between the NPFL and the LPC, and the tribal clashes 
within ULIMO." 
  He stressed that his organization, however, confined itself 
to "a defensive position, in order to prevent those who want to 
derail the peace process."

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The latest Nigerian-supported 
genocide against the innocent civilians has again opened sore 
wounds regarding the neutrality of the Nigerian contingent 
within the multinational peacekeeping force in Liberia. Angry 
citizens in Gbarnga are calling on the leadership of the NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] to demand the 
unconditional withdrawal of the Nigerians from Liberia. The 
citizens also accused ECOMOG field commander General John 
Inienger, who is also a Nigerian, of misleading the people of 
this country into believing that the Nigerians, for peace sake, 
have turned over a new leaf only to realize that they are still 
bent on the destruction of innocent lives and property. 
  Local and international observers say the activities of the 
Nigerian troops within ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] are in themselves an 
obstacle to the peace process and that the only guarantee for 
lasting peace is the complete withdrawal of Nigeria from the 
process here. Since the inception of the civil crisis in 
Liberia, the Nigerians have continued to create splinter armed 
groups against the people of this country with direct support 
intended to prolong the civil crisis. 
  Evidence has emerged in Monrovia that the latest upsurge in 
fighting between rival ULIMO [United Liberian Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia] factions is being fueled by arms sales to 
both groups by ECOMOG. Intelligence sources in ECOMOG itself 
have relayed that the Guinean and Nigerian troops within the 
ECOMOG are involved in the sale of arms to the two fighting 
tribes within ULIMO. Our sources said the sale of arms to rival 
ULIMO factions involved some top-level personnel of the Nigerian 
and Guinean contingents of ECOMOG. 
  The report said the economic gain of the sale is the main 
factor behind the delay by ECOMOG to take any decisive step in 
(?securing and end) to the fighting between the two ULIMO forces. 
  The Koromah group is mainly supplied by the Guinean troops 
of 
ECOMOG while the Krahn faction is being supplied by the Nigerian 
contingent.

  [Text] The all-African peacekeeping force has called on a 
group calling itself the Liberian Peace Council [LPC] to 
unconditionally declare a cease-fire and allow deployment of 
peacekeeping troops within its territory. Both ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] 
and the UN Observer Mission in Liberia, at a meeting with LPC 
representatives, repeated calls to the group to stop all 
hostilities in the southeast of the country without 
preconditions. 
  Recently, LPC leader, (George Kpolley) announced that the 
LPC 
is willing to cooperate with ECOMOG in disarming its fighters, 
but stressed that security must be provided for LPC fighters 
before deployment of ECOMOG troops.

loyalists have captured Suehn, some 25 miles outside Monrovia. 
Reports say scores of civilians are fleeing the combat zone and 
pouring into Veginga outside Monrovia. 
  The latest upsurge in fighting comes in the wake of repeated 
failure by the two opposing sides to honor a cease-fire 
agreement to end the fighting.

  [Excerpts] In Sidi Fredj, Algiers, the proceedings ended 
officially this evening for the sessions of the follow-up 
committee for the implementation of the national agreement 
signed between the Malian Government and the unified Azawad 
movements and fronts. This came with the signing of the minutes 
of the meeting which is known as the Algiers meeting. The 
signing, supervised by the Algerian diplomacy, gives a fresh 
impetus to the Bamako agreement, and puts an end to the 
differences which for years prevented the carrying out of this 
agreement. Our colleague Bechir Hedibel attended the signing 
ceremony and sent us a report: 
  [Begin Hedibel recording] [passage omitted] The agreement 
provides for the integration of all the Azawad fighters in the 
Malian Government organs: army, police, customs, and 
administration. A tripartite committee has been formed and put 
in charge of implementing this provision, and it will start work 
next month. The committee is composed of representatives of the 
Malian Government, the unified Azawad movements and fronts and 
the mediating state, i.e. Algeria. It has been agreed to 
integrate 1,500 fighters in the regular Malian Army, and 4,860 
fighters in civil sectors, i.e. in the civil service. In the 
Algiers agreement, it has been agreed also to remove the 
military bases of the unified Azawad movements in northern Mali. 
In return, the northern population will benefit from 
development projects to break their isolation and integrate them 
in the regular administrative life of the state of Mali.

  [Excerpt] Niamey, 13 May (AFP) -- The Niger Government and 
the Tuareg rebellion have reiterated their desire to end the 
conflict opposing them for close to three years now and which 
has left more than 100 dead, it was announced last night by a 
spokesman of the mediating countries. A mission of the 
representatives of France, Algeria, and Burkina-Faso "has 
observed the desire of the two sides to quickly pursue their 
efforts to resolve the problem opposing them," the spokesman 
indicated on national television. The government and the 
rebellion have "agreed" on the principle of another meeting 
whose date will be fixed "later", he added. 
  The mission has met with members of the High Commission for 
the Restoration of Peace, a government commission responsible 
for the Tuareg rebellion dossier, and representatives of the 
Coordination of the Armed Resistance, which comprises the four 
rebel movements. On 10 May, the mission also held discussions 
with President Mahamane Ousmane, but no statement was issued at 
the end of this meeting. 
  This is the first time the representatives of the three 
mediating countries have undertaken a mission to Niger in 
connection with the settlement of this conflict. Only French 
mediator Jean-Francois Nodinot had until now taken such a step. 
Early in April, he had said that negotiations between the two 
sides would resume on 15 April, but they were once again 
postponed, just like those that were scheduled for the end of 
March. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bamako, 14 May (AFP) -- Six people were killed and 
several others wounded yesterday in Gao (northern Mali) 
following three attacks launched by Tuaregs, a reliable source 
reported today in Bamako. 
  The first incident broke out when three Tuaregs tried to 
seize a land cruiser near the central mosque. One of the 
bandits, caught by the crowd, was stoned and later burned while 
one of the remaining two was killed in an exchange of fire as he 
tried to run away. 
  A few hours later, several men belonging to the Tuareg 
community attacked the hospital, killing three civilians and 
wounding an undetermined number of people. Also, on the night of 
13 May, some Tuaregs threw grenade canisters into a house in 
Gao, killing one woman and injuring one child, the same source 
added. 
  These incidents come at a time when representatives of the 
Malian Government and the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad 
(MFUA, former Tuareg rebels) have been meeting since 10 May in 
Algeria to work out measures that are likely to bring an end to 
the violence in northern Mali.

  [Text] Bamako, 12 May (AFP) -- Oumar Mariko, the former 
leader of the Association of Malian Students and Pupils, [AEEM] 
who was expatriated on 12 May from Cote d'Ivoire 24 hours after 
his arrest in Abidjan, has disclosed that he was arrested by 
gendarmes on his arrival in Bamako, but was then released a few 
hours later. He told the Malian press that he was not 
questioned at the Bamako gendarmerie, where he was taken. 
  Reliable police sources in Abidjan disclosed that the former 
AEEM leader left Abidjan aboard an aircraft from the Air 
Transport and Liaison Group, a national company. 
  Mr. Mariko disclosed that he was questioned in Abidjan on 
his 
meetings with opposition leaders and Ivorian students. No legal 
action is being taken against him in Mali. He arrived in Cote 
d'Ivoire on 10 May on his way from Ouagadougou, where he had 
been staying for a week as part of a tour aimed at establishing 
"a leftist African youth organization." 
  For two years now, the AEEM, which is backed by several 
Malian opposition parties, has been at the root of violent 
demonstrations against President Alpha Oumar Konare's 
government. The association is contesting the new criteria for 
the allocation of student grants, which henceforth will be based 
on examination results. 
  AEEM has 500,000 members, and was at the root of the March 
1991 demonstrations, which led to the ousting of Former Malian 
President Moussa Traore.

<F P=106> [Communique from the Niger Media Workers' Union Executive </F>
Council; place and date not given] 
  [Text] We have learned with dismay and indignation of the 
arrest of four fellow members of the Customs Workers' Union 
[SNAD], including the union's secretary general, who is also the 
financial secretary for the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger. 
On behalf of all state media workers, the national executive 
council denounces this action, which does not foster a social 
climate conducive to the spirit of partnership. It demands the 
unconditional release of the SNAD workers and urges the 
government to show better judgment in the search for a solution 
to workers' problems.

  [Text] Niamey, 15 May (AFP) -- Union sources have disclosed 
that the four officials of the Customs Workers Union [SNAD], 
including Secretary General Ibro Ayouba, arrested on 11 May were 
released today. The four officials were arrested by the 
gendarmes in Niamey for "interfering with the freedom to work." 
  No reason was given for the officials' release. However, 
SNAD had decided to withdraw its notice for a five-day strike as 
of 16 May in order to have the officials released.

  [Text] Lagos, 12 May (AFP) -- The armed opposition 
Democratic Front for Renewal [FDR], in a communique released 
here yesterday, has called for the institution in Niger of a 
federal system that will bring together all Nigerois. The FDR 
said that it has "undertaken to resolutely pursue the political 
and military struggle until all vestiges of this disastrous 
system -- the present system in Niger -- have been completely 
stamped out." The communique, which was signed by Mamane 
Kodelami Ali, a representative of this movement, adds: "With the 
advent of the ruling Alliance of Forces of Change, which 
supports President Mahamane Ousmane, the people of Niger are 
seeing their hopes crumble like a house of cards." 
  The FDR, which is based in the Lake Chad region, accused the 
present regime of "corruption, favoritism, lies, wastage, and 
the deliberate alteration of democracy." The FDR's program 
proposes to cut up Niger into regions, with a federal status in 
conformity with the geographical and social realities, in order 
to ensure stability in the country.

  [Text] The National Constitutional Conference Commission 
has completed its deliberations on the agenda for the 
conference. A clean copy of the agenda will be ready this week 
for submission to the government. The chairman of the publicity 
committee of the commission, Dr. (Wota Ofonagoro), gave this 
information yesterday in the Radio Nigeria Network phoning 
program, Radio Link. He said all the views expressed in the 
memoranda by interest groups and individuals had been taken care 
of in the agenda. Answering a question, Dr. (Ofonagoro), said 
memoranda were received from traditional rulers, articulating 
what their role should be. He stated that the commission would 
recommend that some of them should be nominated to present their 
views at the conference. 
  Also answering a question, the chairman of the finance and 
general purposes committee of the commission, Chief (Derbo 
Akonde), said the military would be a subject on the agenda. He 
said that the military would not be represented at the 
conference to avoid creating the impression that they were there 
to guide the delegates. Chief (Akonde), however, explained that 
the commission, in its recommendation and the government in 
accepting it, did not completely leave out the military. He 
said it was possible that some retired military officers would 
be elected into the conference.

  [Text] The Government of Sierra Leone yesterday published 
the names of former cabinet ministers and others rounded up and 
detained a week ago. Speculation at the time of their arrest 
said that they had been picked up for failure to repay to public 
funds huge sums of money which commissions of inquiry had found 
them guilty of obtaining through corrupt practices. From 
Freetown, Victor Sylver telexed this report. 
  The Sierra Leonean Government has now published 19 names as 
those recently arrested and detained at Pademba Road maximum 
security prison in Freetown. All but two of the detainees are 
former ministers or deputy ministers in the government of 
ex-President Joseph Momoh. The 17 politicians include two 
women: (Emeckley Simbo) and Matilda Conteh, both former deputy 
ministers. Others include former Foreign Minister Abdul Karim 
Koroma, former Development Minister Sheku Kanu, former Transport 
and Communication Minister Michael Abdulai, and the former 
minister for party affairs. The two nonpoliticians detained are 
Mohamed Bangura, a businessman, and the former head of the 
Sierra Leone Fire Brigade, Allassan Kamara. All 19 were picked 
up by the police after an announcement from the government last 
Saturday [7 May] morning that while some of those asked to 
refund various sums to the government had done so, others have 
not. Three commissions of inquiry into corruption found they 
had stolen these funds from the government.

  [Summary from poor reception] "The Nigerian high 
commissioner in Freetown has expressed concern" over a broadcast 
which said that "Nigeria has evacuated 5,000 of its nationals 
with another 2,000 awaiting evacuation." In a release issued in 
Freetown, the high commissioner gave the assurance that the "BBC 
broadcast in question, was completely inacurate." He said that 
there are 50,000 Nigerians in Sierra Leone and that the 
repatriation of a handful should not be a matter for radio 
broadcast. He said there were "42 families of women and 
children who were flown back to Nigeria on Tuesday" [10 May]. 
They were flown back as "foreigners who had lost their homes 
and means of livelihood" as result of rebel activities in an 
area. The high commissioner assured all that he "would do his 
utmost to see to the welfare of his nationals."

  [Text] Kuwait, 14 May -- Eritrea has today denied that it 
has a biased stance in favor of either side in the fighting 
currently raging in Yemen, and called for ending this fighting 
and resorting to peaceful dialogue. 
  This came in an Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry's 
statement 
distributed by the Eritrean Embassy in Kuwait. 
  The statement, a copy of which was sent to KUNA, said that 
"the Eritrean stance towards the conflict in Yemen calls for 
ending the fighting and appealing to reason and the logic of 
dialogue in such a way which achieves the interest of the Yemeni 
people and move it away from the slides of rupture, displacement 
and misery". 
  He added that "from this logic, we repeat the appeal to the 
two parties to the conflict to end the fighting and resort to 
peaceful dialogue in such a way which preserves the interest of 
the Yemeni people, and the security and stability in our region 
in general". 
  The statement described the news which suggested a biased 
Eritrean stance in favor of one of parties in the Yemeni 
conflict against the other as being "untrue and harms Eritrea's 
positive role to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, and it 
harms Eritrea's relations with all the Yemenis alike".

in Accra, in which unknown assailants smeared the place with 
night [as heard] soil. A statement issued by the association 
described the attack as part of a long chain of acts of 
commissions and omissions, which have been calculated to 
intimidate the independent press into abandoning its 
responsibility of contributing to the building of a decent 
society in which the principles of probity and accountability 
are respected. The private media representative on the National 
Media Commission, Mr. Adu Kwabena Asem has, in a similar 
statement condemned the soiling of the premises of the free 
press.

  [Text] Dakar, 15 May (MENA) -- Senegalese press reports say 
the Iranian Embassy in Dakar is involved in financing some 
Islamic fundamentalist movements in Senegal. This has prompted 
the Senegalese authorities to ask Iran to withdraw its 
ambassador from Dakar as soon as possible. However, official 
Senegalese sources have declined to comment on these reports. 
  Observers believe the Senegalese Government is trying to 
deal 
with the situation calmly to avoid any complications that might 
compromise Senegalese-Iranian relations.

  [Text] President Nelson Mandela has taken note of an 
article in the London SUNDAY TIMES claiming that he may retire 
within two years as president of South Africa. The president 
expresses his displeasure with the totally unfounded and 
malicious disinformation published by the London SUNDAY TIMES. 
The article has absolutely no factual basis, and is nothing 
more than rumour mongering written with the intention to create 
uncertainty about South Africa's first democratically elected 
government. President Mandela wishes to state categorically 
that he intends to remain in office for the full term that he 
had been elected to. The people of South Africa have given the 
president a clear mandate, and he intends to fulfill that 
mandate to the fullest.

<F P=106> [Interview with First Executive Deputy President Thabo Mbeki </F>
by SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe on the "Newsline" program on 
15 May -- live] 
  [Text] [Mashokwe] A very warm welcome to this Sunday 
edition of Newsline. Tonight the spotlight falls on the future 
of the new government -- how it intends solving some of the long 
outstanding problems and how it hopes to bring everlasting peace 
and prosperity in this country. The long-awaited dream of a 
democratically elected government in South Africa has finally 
been realized. 
  This week's festivities, among others, saw the inauguration 
of the president and his two deputy presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki 
and Mr. F.W. de Klerk. Now that this time is over, a rough and 
tough road is awaiting this new government. Among the problems 
which need to be addressed is the aspirations of blacks and the 
fears that still exist in some of our white compatriots. With 
me in the studio to discuss the road ahead is the deputy 
president of South Africa, Mr. Thabo Mbeki. Good evening to 
you, sir, and welcome. 
  [Mbeki] Good evening, Leslie. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, are you settling in? 
  [Mbeki] Yes, we are in the process of settling in Leslie. We 
... [pauses] Everybody is moving into new offices and finding 
staff and discovering where the dining rooms are and where the 
toilets are and things like this. Yes, yes, I think everybody 
is in the process of doing that. 
  [Mashokwe] Let us into the last cabinet meeting you had. We 
are talking about a government of national unity, a potpourri of 
people from different backgrounds. Is it working? Will it 
work? Are there problems? 
  [Mbeki] It will work. It will work. I think the ... we are 
all of us proceeding, I think from the same basis, that there 
are certain things that need to be done in the country. People 
need jobs and I don't think any of the parties represented in 
the cabinet would disagree with that. We need to ensure that 
the standard of living of the people throughout the country is 
raised and I think everybody would agree with that. All of us 
agree that we need to attend to the matter of violence, whether 
political or criminal. That has to be attended to. We need to 
ensure that we have proper relations with the rest of the world. 
I think all of these matters are agreed, so we are starting, 
maybe broadly speaking, from the same base, and I think that 
that's what will assist in making this cabinet -- never mind 
that it's got three parties in it -- a cohesive unit. I'm sure 
about that. 
  [Mashokwe] Are there problems? 
  [Mbeki] Well, the ... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Insurmountable -- insurmountable 
problems. 
  [Mbeki] You mean within the cabinet? Sure, I would imagine 
that there would be tensions. We are all coming from different 
points. We've got different histories. We've just come out of 
an election campaign that was vigorously fought and people need 
to get to know one another better. Yes, I would imagine that 
there would be tensions, but as I say that there's a broad 
vision which we all of us share and that fact ought to help in 
terms of overcoming whatever problems there might be in terms of 
people getting used to one another. 
  [Mashokwe] The big expectation out there is that of nation 
building and reconciliation. What would you regard as 
priorities as you step into this? The party's over and 
government has got to start operating now. 
  [Mbeki] Well, the ... Parliament resumes Leslie on the 24th 
of this month, and the president will give a state of the nation 
address, and we expect that that nation, or that state of the 
nation address will reflect the opinion of the cabinet as a 
whole. I think that will be an important moment when this new 
government says: We are speaking with one voice with regard to 
various matters, and that ought to translate in terms of the 
constituencies of the various parties in the cabinet, that at 
that level -- that process of national reconciliation, of 
building one country, of determining priorities and programs -- 
that it is possible to do all of that despite the fact that you 
are dealing with different parties, so I think that's going to 
be an important moment, because at that point, as I say, the 
cabinet will speak with one voice, I hope, and that ought to 
send the message to the country that we can and must, as 
different political entities, act together. 
  We want, also, to ensure that in the preparation of that 
presentation by the president, that the president would have 
consulted further, further than the parties represented in the 
cabinet -- the unions, the business community, the civic 
organizations, the traditional leaders and so on, so that you 
... what you should then get coming across on the 24th of May, 
is a national vision. 
  [Mashokwe] But that doesn't answer my question on what you 
as 
deputy president will regard as priorities. 
  [Mbeki] Sure, the priorities. I thought you were asking a 
question about what needs to be done to convey an image, a 
message of reconciliation and of acting together. With regard 
to priorities, surely the priority, the basic priority, must be 
to -- as quickly as is possible -- to change the conditions of 
life of the people. That has to be basic, whether it relates to 
jobs or housing or health or education or land or any of these 
questions. That has to be fundamental priority. The people 
have won their democratic rights. They voted -- exercised that 
right, elected government of their choice. The next step in the 
emancipation of the people must be to address the issues of 
freedom from hunger, freedom from poverty, from want -- all of 
those sorts of questions. That must be priority. 
  Of course there must be detailed programs -- when ... what 
do 
you do with housing? What do you do with job creation, 
provision of water in the countryside and all these questions? 
But I think that that's a priority that must underpin this. 
  I was saying earlier that one of the questions again that is 
critically important is the matter of violence. Just now, on 
Friday, 12 people got killed at Thokoza. We ought not to have 
anything of that kind. More than 400 people have been killed in 
Natal since the state of emergency was declared. That must be 
priority. It's both political and criminal violence -- but that 
must be priority in terms of the programs that this new 
government must engage in. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's go back to the issue of reconciliation if 
we 
may. Sir, the point is people were murdered, maimed, killed in 
the past and you talk ... [pauses] The ANC talks of a commission 
of truth. At one point we have amnesty for security generals -- 
people, and the question is: Are you going to come up with a 
blanket amnesty for political killings at the expense of people 
who probably still have that pain in their heart, who were 
killed, maimed, during those days? 
  [Mbeki] Leslie, this new government of national unity has 
not 
yet discussed this question, so I couldn't speak for that 
government on this issue. It is clearly a matter that must be 
addressed. Our own view with regard to this is that if we took 
the route of amnesty, indemnity, whatever, it would be important 
that anybody affected -- it doesn't matter from where they come 
-- whether they come from the ANC or from anywhere else, that 
they must say what it is they want to be indemnified for. If I 
ask for indemnity, I need to say: These are the things that I 
did for which I require indemnity, but as I say, the matter has 
not been discussed. It clearly is one of the issues that will 
be discussed by this new government, but I am reflecting on a 
discussion which I think goes beyond the ANC. Even the legal 
community in the country is raising the point, that if there is 
to be amnesty for anybody it needs to be known what it is that 
they are applying for. 
  [Mashokwe] But will that not open up wounds? 
  [Mbeki] No, the intention is not to open up wounds. The 
intention is to solve an existing problem, and as you are 
saying, there are many problems that have not been solved. I've 
got a first cousin of mine who disappeared. We don't know -- as 
a family we have looked. We have asked questions. We don't 
know where he is. He has disappeared. It's possible that 
somebody out there knows, and it will be good for the family 
that they know -- not for purposes of retribution -- so that at 
least we know that this person is gone forever. No, it's not 
for purposes of retribution. We are not after Nuremberg trials. 
We are ... [pauses] It's necessary to clean the slate, to solve 
these outstanding questions -- answer them, and so that we can 
at least know what it is that we should never repeat again, in 
future. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki, I need to ask you this one. It's very 
important. You are deputy president and reports reaching us 
here indicate that in the next two years or so Mr. Mandela might 
be handing over the reins of power to you. Is that the plan? 
  [Mbeki] No Leslie, the ... [pauses] I heard today that a 
London newspaper, THE SUNDAY TIMES, carried some report that 
Nelson Mandela is going to retire after two years or something 
-- absolutely no truth to this. In fact we ... I found it 
rather reprehensible that you could get a newspaper like that 
and whoever writes for it, writing a thing like that. They ... 
[pauses] I'm quite certain. They didn't even have the courtesy 
to ask Nelson Mandela is this true. I know they certainly 
didn't come to me. No substance of any truth at all to this, 
and dealing with this particular newspaper it's not the first 
time that they floated all sorts of funny ideas which, you know, 
seem to us clearly intended to destabilize the ANC, in this 
instance to destabilize the new government, the presidency. 
There's no substance. Nelson Mandela has been elected to lead 
this country for five years when we'll have the next election, 
and it will be up to the ANC and Mandela to decide whether he 
stands for a second term of office. There's no truth whatsoever 
to the story and as I say I think it's rather reprehensible. I 
think it's ... [pauses] You are a journalist. You are part of 
the media. I think it is bad ethics for the media to handle 
matters in the way that this particular newspaper has handled 
this matter. 
  [Mashokwe] But you are the national chairman. You are the 
deputy president. It is not ludicrous, anyway, for people to 
speculate in that direction. Is it? 
  [Mbeki] Well, you see, sure -- I suppose there's no law 
against speculation. That's perfectly alright, but to assert 
this matter in the way as I understand that this particular 
newspaper asserted it, that highly-placed sources in the ANC, 
whatever phrase was used. I think that's bad, particularly 
that, I mean, if this was serious I would have expected that 
your fellow journalists would try and seek Nelson Mandela's 
opinion to say: Mr. President, I understand the following -- 
what's your view? But they don't, and the intention can't be 
honorable. The intention can't be to inform. I think the 
intention is something else. 
  [Mashokwe] Okay, let's look at other issues -- death 
penalty. Some right-wingers were given the death sentence very 
recently. There are question marks around the ANC's policy on 
death penalty, some say the official one ... [pauses] line is -- 
now, you don't like -- the ANC does not like the death penalty. 
Are you going to institute death penalties? Is the ANC 
government going to move away from death penalties? What is the 
thinking? 
  [Mbeki] We are against the death penalty, and I'm quite 
certain that when the matter gets discussed that's the position 
that the ANC will present. We don't think its correct for 
ordinary persons like ourselves to take into our hands the power 
to take away other people's lives. The matter will be discussed 
surely, but as I say, our own view remains that it would not be 
correct for the government to give itself such power. The right 
to life -- the right to life as South Africans -- I think we 
need to be very sensitive to that because too many people have 
died in this country, in criminal violence, in political 
violence. People continue to die, and I think you want to 
create a society which has a sense of revulsion at the fact of 
murder, of taking away of people's lives, whether it's done by 
elected organs of state or by individuals. 
  [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, let's think a bit about the Hani 
murder, for instance. It occurred during the days of the old 
government and the sentence passed, in people's eyes, befitted 
the action. Are you going to be standing in the way of the 
carrying out of that action? 
  [Mbeki] Well, as I say Leslie, as I say, talking about the 
ANC -- we want to say no. Sure, the commission of crime, of any 
crime, must receive the necessary response from the judicial 
organs of the country, but we do not believe that this 
particular retribution, this particular punishment, death, 
solves anything. It perpetuates a notion which is unhealthy, 
that people can take other people's lives. 
  [Mashokwe] Let's move over to matters financial. A lot has 
been written in the papers about the pay raises that the new 
government has earned itself, or what the Melamet Commission has 
recommended. A lot of people say in the days of electioneering, 
the ANC, particularly, was vocal on the need to cut on 
government expenditure, salaries for that matter. The question 
is: What action are you going to be taking now that you are in 
government? 
  [Mbeki] Well, we would like to have the recommendations of 
the Melamet Commission discussed by parliament, in the first 
instance. There may be some technical problems about payments. 
You've got members of parliament sitting there, you've got 
ministers sitting there, and there may not be any particular 
framework to deal with the matter of their salaries at the end 
of this month. That's got to be addressed somehow. But no, we 
would want to -- parliament, and society in general -- to 
participate in the debate as to ... about this particular 
matters, so there hasn't been a decision, certainly not on the 
part of the ANC and certainly not on the part of Parliament, to 
say that we accept the recommendations of the Melamet Commission. 
  We would want all those matters discussed openly and 
criteria, rules, principles and all of that, discussed and 
agreed, but I think we also need to say this Leslie, that it's 
important not to set up a salary structure for elected officials 
such that you expose those elected officials to bribery, and 
that's important. If you take an elected official and you pay 
them at rates which are clearly inadequate you expose them to 
temptation. You also clearly don't need to pay those elected 
officials at rates that are far above what people in equivalent 
positions are earning, because you are creating a different 
problem. 
  So I'm saying that we need to find a balanced solution to 
this question, but certainly, if you said you want to have your 
elected officials living as though in monasteries or nunneries, 
what's going to happen? You are going to call them back here to 
say: Why did you accept this money from here or there, because 
in the end, in terms of maintaining families and leading 
ordinary lives, if you expose them to poverty, they will ... 
they will be susceptible to bribes. 
  [Mashokwe] Today's newspapers indicate that a national debt 
of 60 billion rand has been accumulated and you are receiving 
this in your hands as you move into office. Is that a priority? 
Is that a problem? 
  [Mbeki] The size of the national debt is a problem. It's 
been a very ... [pauses] It's become a very high-ranking element 
in terms of public expenditure. The servicing of that public 
debt -- it has been -- last year it was, I understood, second 
after education -- I hear ... I see in the press now that it's 
likely to become the first element. Yes it is a worrying factor 
because it means that you tax the public, raise public revenues 
in order to service, to pay the banks. It's something that must 
be addressed very seriously and it's part of the constraint. 
It's part of the constraint in terms of the handling of public 
finances, that you couldn't act in a way which once more raises 
that public debt, because I say in the end you have national 
resources being consumed by servicing that. It's a real 
situation. It's unfortunate that it happened, but we inherited 
it and we've got to deal with it as best as we can. 
  [Mashokwe] You referred earlier on to violence that has been 
rearing its head here and there in the country. The question 
is: Are we going to see you being able to cut on defense and 
security in the coming years, as it was envisaged by the ANC -- 
we will cut money on defense, use it for other things. What is 
the situation now as you move into real government. 
  [Mbeki] Yes, we do believe it's a -- if you are talking 
about defense -- it should be possible to keep those defense 
figures low, because, in the first instance, you know we've got 
to read the situation. What is the threat to this democratic 
South Africa? We are talking about the defense forces. Does 
Swaziland threaten us, or Lesotho, or Botswana, whatever, 
meriting whatever expenditure -- or do we have a naval threat 
from India so that we must buy many naval ships and all that? I 
would imagine that that kind of threat is not really there. 
That should help to address the issue of what source of 
expenditure we should have on defense. 
  With regard to the maintenance of law and order, hopefully 
the situation is going to change, the situation with regard to 
the relationship between the police and the public. I know for 
a fact that the new minister of safety and security is very 
concerned about this matter, senior police officers are 
concerned about this matter, because I do believe that once you 
change that relationship between the police and the people, the 
capacity of the police to prevent crime and to catch wrongdoers 
will be much increased. It may not need more policemen, it will 
certainly need better cooperation between the people and the 
police. 
  [Mashokwe] Millions of rands have been pledged to the 
country 
by foreign governments over the past few days. America spoke of 
600 million dollars and we say, where is this money going to? 
  [Mbeki] That money ought to go into reconstruction and 
development. It ought to go directly into projects that are 
targeted at improving the conditions of life of the people, 
whether it's housing or health, clean water in the rural areas, 
roads so that people have got access -- that's where it ought to 
go. 
  [Mashokwe] But if past experiences are anything to go by, 
many of these monies have ended up in bureaucracies, and this 
brings me to the question of civil service. A smaller, 
efficient civil service is what the ANC was taking about. Does 
this mean people are going to lose their jobs? 
  [Mbeki] Well, we don't have past experience Leslie in this 
country [laughter] because there has never been a democratic 
government. 
  [Mashokwe] Eh, but there was a government [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Mbeki] Yeah, not a democratic one anyway. No, with regard 
to the public service. We have said, indeed, that we are not 
after sacking anybody. We -- job security is guaranteed, 
questions of pensions are not going to be affected, but clearly 
we have got to keep public expenditure down with regards to that 
kind of expenditure. I am not talking about capital 
expenditure, public works programs, and so on. We have got to 
keep recurrent expenditure down, so the ANC certainly does not 
have any intention of a radical increase in numbers of people 
within the public service, who are -- without offending anybody 
-- who are pen-pushers, and I think it will be possible. There 
are many structures of government that are being established in 
terms of the new constitution, which structures of government we 
will probably need the civil servants that are already employed. 
We might have to increase, somewhat, but I am saying that we 
are not looking forward to a radical rise in recurrent 
expenditure because clearly it would have a negative impact. 
  [Mashokwe] But Mr. Mbeki, how then are you going to be 
implementing affirmative actions? People who voted for the ANC 
believed that their lot would be changed come an ANC government? 
  [Mbeki] Well, yes, sure, change must happen. Change must 
happen. Change does not happen necessarily because you increase 
the number of people in an office from five to 20. Change can 
happen in many ways. You see, for instance the South African 
economy, the South African economy needs very many skilled 
people, whether they are technicians or engineers or whatever. 
So I mean, it ought not to be that we proceed from the position 
that to create employment take them into the public service. 
Why don't we say, in the context of a growing economy you are 
going to need all the skills? 
  [Mashokwe] Is it out of question, Mr. Mbeki -- I have to 
butt 
in here -- to say there are people who were advantaged by the 
apartheid government then, who ascended to positions like that 
of a general, and somebody who voted for you would want to say, 
I have been in civil service and I hope to be able to move up 
there because the government has changed, and I have the 
qualifications. I was denied this in the past? 
  [Mbeki] Sure, very legitimate, and I would believe that the 
public service commission for instance would look very favorably 
at that. We want to remove racism, we want to remove 
discrimination, whether gender or race. We need to remove that 
discrimination from the system, and indeed you are quite right, 
you might find that there are people who have the competence, 
the experience, the qualifications, but who were kept down 
because there was apartheid, and that those matters certainly 
need to be addressed. 
  [Mashokwe] Is South Africa rejoining the world -- the OAU, 
SADC [Southern African Development Community], PTA [Preferential 
Trade Area], AFD [expansion unknown]? 
  [Mbeki] The new South Africa will be admitted by the OAU 
when 
it meets at summit level during the month of June. We certainly 
will be looking for an early meeting with the SADC to look at -- 
there has been prior discussion with them about this -- but to 
look at what happens, how South Africa joins this grouping, and 
many groups like this, the African Development Bank... 
  [Mashokwe, interrupting] Commonwealth? 
  [Mbeki] Commonwealth, yes. In our own view South Africa 
should go back into the Commonwealth, but again this is a 
decision that the new government will have to take. 
  [Mashokwe] Mr. Mbeki thanks for your time, and thanks for 
talking to us. 
  [Mbeki] Thanks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] He has been described as ambitious and is often 
passed off as a political moderate. He has also been praised 
for his astute diplomatic skills, political incisiveness and his 
pragmatism. But above all, Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's director of 
international relations, is best known for his charm, 
statesmanship and ability to keep his composure. Born more than 
51 years ago on June 18, in the Transkei, Mbeki was initiated 
into the struggle in his early teens. He became one of the ANC's 
youngest National Executive Committee (NEC) members and has been 
a member of the organisation for most of his life. The son of 
the ANC and SA [South African] Communist Party leader, Goven 
Mbeki, joined the ANC's youth league in 1956, when he was just 
14 years old. 
  He is as much a product of his father's influence as he is a 
graduate of student struggles. This is despite the fact that he 
spent most of his political life separated from his father, who 
spent a quarter of a century behind bars after being imprisoned 
with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu and the other Rivonia 
trialists in 1964. But by then, Thabo Mbeki had already emerged 
as a significant figure in student politics and had been through 
a number of struggles at school. In 1959 he was forced to 
continue his studies at home when the school he attended in 
Lovedale near Alice in Eastern Cape was shut down after a 
student strike. Mbeki was politically active at the school. 
  Not much is known of his early childhood, but Isaac Mogase, 
an ANC activist at the time, remembers Mbeki "as a very naughty 
little boy." Mogase recalls that event at the youthful age of 
17, Thabo showed leadership qualities, he was a very good judge 
of people. "His childhood spontaneity has been replaced by a 
mature personality that is difficult to fault," Mogase added, 
when asked about Mbeki in 1990 soon after his return to the 
country from exile. 
  After matriculating in 1959, Mbeki went on to study 
economics 
as a correspondence student at a British university. It was 
during this time that Mbeki joined the ANC's underground 
structures. In 1961 he was elected secretary of the African 
Student's Association (ASA), and worked under the direction of 
Walter Sisulu and Duma Nokwe. 
  Thabo left the country in 1962 on the instructions of the 
ANC 
as part of one of the first groups sent out for training. He 
made his way through Botswana to what was then Southern 
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe. There he was arrested and almost 
repatriated to South Africa. Fortunately, however, he was given 
political asylum in Tanzania, and left for London soon after to 
complete his Masters degree in economics at Sussex University in 
1966. During his student years, Mbeki remained active in 
student politics and maintained contact with international 
student and youth organisations, including the international 
Union of Socialist Youth. 
  He also played a very prominent role in building the ANC 
youth and student section outside the country and, from the 
beginning, he was regarded as being a leader in these sectors. 
During this period the ANC had only one full-time 
representative in London and the bulk of the organisation's work 
was done by students like Mbeki. 
  In those early years in exile, Oliver Tambo and Yusuf Dadoo 
were two of the major political figures who influenced Mbeki. 
After university, Mbeki worked in the ANC's London office until 
1970 when he moved to Lusaka after completing his military 
training in the Soviet Union. During his initial stay in 
Lusaka, he was appointed the secretary of the organisation's 
Revolutionary Council. He also served as the ANC's acting 
representative in Swaziland from 1975 to 1976, before returning 
to ANC headquarters in Lusaka. 
  In 1975, he was elected to the ANC's National Executive 
Committee and became the political secretary in the office of 
the ANC president Oliver Tambo and subsequently director of 
information. During the seventies, he was also involved in 
building the ANC in Swaziland and underground structures inside 
the country. An added quality in this regard was his 
willingness to undertake any mission, no matter how dangerous, 
if that was what the movement required of him. 
  "He's always calm and composed and has a very warm and 
endearing personality." So, even if someone disagrees with him 
at great deal, they cannot but help to appreciate him. "He 
always tries to understand the other side's point of view. But 
this does not mean that he is weak -- it is just that, even in 
arriving at his own position, he would take a very close look at 
what others have to say," one of his close associates said. 
  While most have known Mbeki for his "remarkable diplomatic 
qualities," ANC members closer to him point out that his most 
outstanding quality is that he is a "very deep thinker." 
  His worth in international affairs brought him into contact 
with statesmen all over the world in his relentless efforts to 
isolate apartheid, a move that the ANC regarded as crucial. 
  Mbeki was elected to the position of National Chairperson of 
the ANC last year. Since then he has served as both chief of 
international affairs and chairperson. Last week, President 
Nelson Mandela named Mbeki as his first vice-president. He was 
formally inaugurated into that position on Tuesday.

  [Text] Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader and Home Affairs 
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said his party is still committed 
to international mediation regarding federalism and the Zulu 
monarchy. He said this at a function organized by the Inkatha 
Youth Brigade at Undini during the party's Natal victory 
celebrations. The occasion was also used to honor his 
leadership. 
  He commended President Nelson Mandela and Vice-President 
F.W. 
de Klerk for their views regarding the Zulu monarch, 
particularly in the period before the election. Dr. Buthelezi 
emotionally thanked Natal voters for their support. He praised 
officials of the KwaZulu administration for their loyalty when 
there was talk of overthrowing the government. He said the 
struggle for freedom and federalism had just begun, and that the 
IFP would take the lead in this struggle. Dr. Buthelezi asked 
his supporters, for the sake of the region's future, to make 
peace with their opponents. He said economic investments can 
only be expected in provinces where there is peace and political 
stability.

  [Text] Ulundi May 14 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
president and minister of home affairs Chief Mangosuthu 
Buthelezi launched a stinging attack on the media for 
"demonising" him and his party in the run-up to the election. 
Addressing an IFP victory rally in the KwaZulu/Natal region on 
Saturday, Chief Buthelezi said: "We had no money, we had the 
media against us, we had gurus at universities against us." "I 
thank the editors and journalists who had a field day vilifying 
me both here and abroad." 
  He decried the fact that the IFP, which entered the election 
race late had only six days to campaign, adding that the 
confidence ordinary people had in his leadership assured him 
victory. "Never in the history of democracy has any political 
party entered an election with just six days left to campaign 
and then go on to win as the IFP has done in KwaZulu/Natal." 
  Chief Buthelezi implored his supporters to work for 
reconciliation to overcome the hostilities in the townships and 
rural areas, caused by a drawn out internecine conflict which 
has claimed more than 10,000 lives in KwaZulu/Natal. "Go out 
and break down the barriers that divide you from your political 
opponents. Go out and spread the word of peace and 
reconciliation." 
  Chief Buthelezi said: "There can be no economic development 
in the region until we achieve peace. No businessman will want 
to invest in this region if his life is in danger. No investor 
will want to build factories if their factories are going to be 
burned down. We will have to work at political reconciliation 
if we are to end up with a national will to make democracy work 
for the benefit of the people." 
  He said South Africa's new coalition government faced a 
difficult task, adding that the politics of the dominant ANC 
partner differed in many respects from Inkatha's. "And yet, 
through this so-called government of national unity, we have to 
operate together jointly as a cabinet. It is not going to be 
easy," he warned. But he assured President Nelson Mandela of 
his cooperation. 
  Chief Buthelezi made it clear the IFP's election win in 
KwaZulu- Natal meant the government of KwaZulu-Natal was an IFP 
government. "The future of this region in relation to everything 
that has still to be settled can only be settled with the full 
agreement of the IFP and its leadership." 
  Chief Buthelezi said the IFP shared the objectives of the 
ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme, but cast doubt 
on the ability of the programme to achieve its stated goals. 
"We fear it that it may not work simply because it says that 
the government will provide everything to the people. Nowhere 
in the world has the state been able to provide for all the 
needs of a country's people."

  [Text] Ulundi May 15 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
president and Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi on 
Sunday underscored the church's role in rejecting apartheid and 
its importance as a force elevating the ideals of democracy and 
freedom. 
  Speaking at a KwaZulu day of prayer and thanksgiving, Mr 
Buthelezi said the church could emphasise the positive features 
of KwaZulu/Natal's divergence and plurality by encouraging the 
people of the region to feel mutual acceptance and respect for 
one another. 
  He said he believed the church could promote nation building 
and unity and could use its influence to promote a transition 
through non-violent, democratic and negotiated means. 
  The IFP president appealed to his followers to foster 
compassion for humanity to bring an end to violence and 
destruction. He called on people to rely on the church to 
provide strength in times of trouble and to resolve conflicts 
that arise "between you and your neighbours". 
  "The politics of reconstruction is more than the politics of 
pragmatic adjustments. It has to do with the rediscovery of 
nation building, and perhaps the most important contribution the 
church can make as our country struggles to find new direction, 
is the promotion of a sense of national unity", Mr Buthelezi 
said. 
  He urged South African leaders to turn away from the past to 
a fundamentally different kind of future. All South Africans 
needed to develop a resolute commitment to restitution and 
socio-political and economic reconstruction. 
  The KwaZulu/Natal region held great economic potential which 
could be unleashed by an autonomous regional government. This 
would require commitment to the establishment of a stable and 
prosperous economy from parties participating in the 
KwaZulu/Natal provincial legislature. 
  He told supporters the people of KwaZulu/Natal were at a 
[incomplete sentence as received].

  [Text] New Housing Minister Joe Slovo spelt out preliminary 
but ambitious plans for his portfolio yesterday, including the 
establishment of a national housing bank and the implementation 
of a mortgage indemnity scheme. 
  An upbeat Slovo expressed support for agreements already 
achieved by the National Housing Forum, and endorsed the concept 
of the provision of housing as a kick-start for the economy. 
  Slovo said priority had to be given to the poor, who had 
been 
ignored largely in the past and had to be brought into the 
mainstream of policy. He stressed all major players would need 
to be engaged, especially the private sector, which had a 
"seminal" role to play. Slovo mooted the idea of a housing 
summit to gain wide involvement and establish a logic to the 
provision of housing, which had been somewhat "constipated." 
  The provision of housing could be a major generator of jobs, 
but for this to happen there had to be a great degree of market 
certainty to release the "latent energy" in the sector. The 
idea of a national housing bank had to be realised, although the 
details needed to be planned with care. Slovo said one of his 
major tasks would be to develop a good relationship with the 
provincial housing administrations. 
  The ANC's reconstruction and development programme specified 
that 1-million "housing units" should be built within five 
years, which Slovo said was realisable although it might not be 
possible to build 370,000 houses in the first year. 
  Slovo said he was "over the moon" about his portfolio. 
  "We have been talking liberation, but this will be the 
beginning of making liberation...There is so much goodwill, I 
think there is a very good chance we can make a breakthrough."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Not Quite the Dream Team] </F>
  [Text] A mixed bag -- that's our verdict on the new 
cabinet. There are some excellent appointments; some truly 
appalling; and many that are just mediocre. 
  That makes it better than any cabinet this country has seen 
before, but leaves us disappointed that Nelson Mandela has not 
made the fullest and best use of the large amount of talent 
available to him. And there are some choices that are 
horrifyingly inappropriate. 
  The real shock must be the absence of Cyril Ramaphosa. 
Mandela has blundered badly by not finding or creating the 
right post to make full use of Ramaphosa's talents and 
experience in the cabinet. 
  Notable cabinet selections are: 
  -- Dullah Omar, justice: A sensible choice, he has extensive 
court experience as both a lawyer and attorney. He will now be 
in charge of those judges that refused to release him from 
detention without trial in a notorious 1980s test case. 
  -- Joe Slovo, housing: An inspired use of a practical man 
with the radical credibility to deal with the huge demands this 
ministry will face. 
  -- Dr Nkosozana Zuma, health: A sound decision. Health 
workers say she has experience and a good grasp of health 
policy, even though her public image is poor. 
  -- Joe Modise, defence: The SADF generals may be happy to 
have a hawk with a tarnished reputation (for his failure to stop 
torture in exile camps), but anyone associated with Umkhonto we 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] when he led it 
will tell you how poor a choice he is. 
  -- Sidney Mufamadi, safety and security: An interesting 
choice, he has been groomed for the post. 
  -- Dr Sibusiso Bhengu, education: An unexpected minister. 
He has had no involvement in any of the extensive policy and 
planning work in this field. As rector of Fort Hare, he had to 
leave after falling foul of an internal student conflict. 
Mandela probably had in mind that as a Zulu and a former IFP 
general secretary, he would help balance the cabinet. 
  -- Alfred Nzo in foreign affairs is a surprise. There cannot 
be a less appropriate choice for such a critical post as this 
dour and ineffectual man who was ousted as ANC general secretary. 
  -- Pallo Jordan, posts, telecommunications and broadcasting: 
The natural choice. 
  -- Mac Maharaj, transport: Has been given a surprisingly 
junior post, but at least his talents are in the cabinet. 
  -- Roelf Meyer, a Nat [National Party] that Mandela can 
trust, is a brilliant choice for provincial and constitutional 
affairs. 
  -- Derek Hanekom, land: Will be a relief to anyone concerned 
with this issue. He has earned respect for his involvement in 
it in recent years, but will face a tough task in his forced 
partnership with Kraai van Niekerk, who holds the post of 
agricultural minister. 
  -- Stella Sigcau can only have been chosen for public 
enterprises because she is a traditional leader and one of the 
few women with cabinet experience, albeit in a homeland where 
she was ousted amid corruption charges by Bantu Holomisa, now a 
deputy minister. 
  -- Derek Keys is a wise compromise in finance, particularly 
as he is fenced in by the formidable trio of Trevor Manuel in 
trade and industry, Jay Naidoo in reconstruction and Alec Erwin 
as deputy finance minister. 
  -- Steve Tshwete was a natural choice for sport. 
  -- If Mangosuthu Buthelezi had to have a senior post, home 
affairs is fairly neutral, though it means he will run future 
elections. 
  It is extraordinary that so important a reconstruction 
portfolio as welfare should be in the hands of a Nat with a 
dubious reputation, Abe Williams. 
  -- Artists must be horrified at falling into the combined 
hands of the IFP's Ben Ngubane, minister of arts, culture, 
science and technology, and deputy minister Winnie Mandela. 
They will find themselves caught between a Zulu nationalist and 
a woman still under investigation for alleged corruption in the 
ANC department of welfare. What a disappointment in the very 
week when the president inauguration celebrations, a brilliant 
choreographed display of all- inclusive multiculturism, showed 
us the power of cultures as a benign, unifying national force. 
  Some of the more controversial appointments are off-set by 
strong deputy ministerships, such as Valli Moosa in provincial 
affairs, Aziz Pahad in foreign affairs, and Penuell Manduna in 
home affairs. Others -- such as education and welfare -- will 
depend on strong appointments to the key posts of 
directors-general. 
  Mandela did reasonably well in negotiating a political, 
racial, and geographic balance, but made little attempt to 
achieve a gender balance. 
  He has assembled a team with some strengths, but too many 
weaknesses. The pity is that it could have been a dream team.

<F P=106> [Article by business editor John Spira] </F>
  [Text] Aid approaching R[rand] 5 billion is poised to pour 
into South Africa. But it is nowhere near enough to lift an 
economy which, nevertheless, has the potential to achieve 
much-heightened growth rates. 
  Aid of about R1.7 billion a year might seem a lot of money. 
Yet perspective indicates that R1.7 billion worth of aid in the 
next 12 months is about equal to the cost of establishing one 
new gold mine. It's half the sum South Africa borrowed from the 
International Monetary Fund at the end of last year -- funds 
used to bolster foreign exchange reserves which, in spite of 
that injection, are now, only five months later, under severe 
pressure. Indeed, in the first four months of 1994, the net 
reserves plummeted by R3.2 billion, equivalent to more than two 
years' worth of foreign aid. 
  Accordingly, the aid-to-SA [South Africa] conduit won't even 
begin to have a favourable impact on an economy desperately 
trying to emerge from five years of crippling recession. Not 
that we should be looking for handouts to pull us out of the 
economic mire. We need to be tugging ourselves up by our own 
bootstraps. Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a 
poor work ethic -- as countries to our north have discovered at 
exorbitant cost. In short, the entire country has to get back 
to work -- to work hard, efficiently, and assiduously. Is the 
nation prepared and able to do just this? The portents are 
promising. What remains is for the potential to be realised. 
  It is the new Government's most awesome task to get people 
into jobs, to train them to do those jobs well and to ensure 
that they keep doing them well. It won't be easy and it won't 
happen soon. The starting point is to enhance South Africa's 
economic growth rate. Even this year's predicted 3 percent is 
well short of the desired mark. Next year simply has to be 5 
percent plus -- and, if one is to take a less than jaundiced 
view of the future, it can be achieved. How? 
  -- The psychology is right. All South Africans are suddenly 
on the same side, working for the same goals. No more is 
government at such odds with labour and business; no more is 
labour at such odds with business. Co-operation among all the 
aspects of production translates into meaningful economic growth. 
  -- Foreign investment, as opposed to foreign aid, stands 
ready to enter an economy no longer constantly threatened by 
violence and labour unrest -- an economy with a well-developed 
infrastructure, a sound legal system and one which offers an 
attractive platform for launching products into sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
  -- Even without the post-apartheid benefits that are about 
to 
accrue, the economy has been emerging from recession. The major 
indicators are pointing up and, given a heightened level of 
foreign and domestic investment, they are poised to point yet 
higher. 
  -- Inflation remains in single-digit territory. While many 
fear that the huge social upliftment expenditure targeted by the 
new Government will before long jerk inflation back into double 
digits, the substantial excess production capacity in the 
economy and the Reserve Bank's continued vigilance are notable 
ameliorating factors. 
  -- International capital markets are now, as seldom before, 
ready to lend to South Africa. Although they involve a cost in 
the form of interest payments, if the funds thereby raised are 
used to expand the nation's productive base, the interest bill 
can be covered many times over by heightened exports and import 
replacement. 
  -- Much local and foreign money is destined for education 
and 
training. Some dividends will be garnered only many years into 
the future. But some, particularly in the training arena, will 
accrue in the near term. In concert with the will to work hard, 
those dividends will help lubricate South Africa's economic 
engine. 
  -- Interest rates are scheduled to decline in the near 
future 
as the balance of payments constraint is rendered less onerous 
by capital inflows. Cheaper money implies more investment in 
productive capacity and increased spending -- vital ingredients 
for growth. 
  -- The global economy is expanding. This is bound to benefit 
all exporting nations, including South Africa. In addition, the 
upturn is coinciding with a revival in the commodities cycle. 
And South Africa is among the world's leading exporters of 
gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, manganese, and chrome. 
  Too optimistic a scenario? Are there no flies in the 
economic ointment? 
  Earlier in the year, the gloom and doom merchants predicted 
that the election would bring chaos; that the Left-leaning 
elements in the ANC would drive the country down the communist 
precipice. Today they're silent. Business people are positive. 
The Johannesburg Stock exchange continues to scale new peaks, 
pointing to a future more prosperous than the recent past. 
  Even so, flies, among them exchange control, are by no means 
absent from the ointment. 
  International investors are invariably reticent about 
placing 
their money in a country which prevents its unfettered 
repatriation. They're wary of a country which aims to attract 
foreign capital via a discounted financial rand. 
  Why not, then, abolish exchange controls and scrap the 
financial rand? Because vast sums of funk money would leave our 
shores, plundering our scarce foreign exchange reserves. At 
least that's been the reason for the past decade or so. It's a 
reason which could evaporate if confidence is restored -- 
confidence that South Africa does indeed have a bright future; 
confidence that capital seeks to flow into the country rather 
than out of it; confidence that democracy will bring with it 
responsible government of responsible citizens. 
  Ultimately, South Africa will row its own boat. Its 
oarsmen's determination, wisdom, and strength will determine its 
destiny.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  WEEKEND STAR </H8>
  Future Pitfalls -- While South Africa still faces political 
problems, "the pitfalls for the future lie rather in another 
direction," how South Africa "addresses the majority's 
aspirations" as the "new South Africa will live or die by the 
economic decisions it takes now," an editorial in the 
Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English on 14-15 May on page 10 
notes. "Initial signs are encouraging. Mandela has retained 
Derek Keys as Finance Minister" and "surrounded him with solid 
choices" Trevor Manuel and Tito Mboweni. As "aid, as illustrated 
elsewhere in Africa, can become an unwelcome albatross for a 
young government attempting to find its feet," "the ANC's 
economists, in their dealings with the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund, have generally shown a healthy 
reluctance to get tied down by terms dictated to them." 
"Obviously it would be churlish for South Africa to turn its 
back on nations anxious to help it through a testing period. But 
the government must exercise the utmost caution before it dives 
into waters containing dangerous undercurrants." 
<H8>  NEW NATION </H8>
  Acknowledging Sacrifices -- It was a "joyous week" for South 
Africa, but "it is important that we acknowledge the sacrifices 
that have been made by so many who have not lived to join in 
this feast of our freedom," an editorial in Johannesburg NEW 
NATION in English on 13 May on page 7 states. "We must recognize 
that the suffering" of Mozambique "was a direct consequence of 
the role that country and its people played in the struggle 
against apartheid." Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] was 
"spawned by those who orchestrated apartheid's defense." And the 
"devasting" suffering in Angola "mainly because of the help it 
gave to the ANC in its battle against apartheid." UNITA 
[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] "continues 
to exist and fester in Angola only because it was expedient from 
the point of view of apartheid." The help of Zambia's Kaunda and 
Tanzania's Nyerere was not "adequately " acknowledged and "it 
needs to be said very forcefully" that "we might not have been 
in a position to celebrate a victory this week had it not been 
for the Cubans" who "committed their lives to defeating 
apartheid's defense force at Cuito Cuanavale." "While the debt 
we owe these nations is not one we can pretend we will be able 
to settle, we must at least acknowledge it." 
  Reconciliation -- "Much has been said about the need for 
reconciliation" and "without a doubt" it "must be one of our 
priorities," the second editorial in the 13 May NEW NATION 
notes. However, "as important as reconciliation is, we must 
ensure that we do not pursue this objective with romantic 
enthusiasm." "We must remember that the victory we recorded was 
not without immense cost." While "we cannot forget that some of 
the most senior ministers in the GNU [Government of National 
Unity] were among those that sat in the State Security Council 
in P W Botha's government," "this is not to suggest that we need 
to be suspicious of those we work with. Instead what we need is 
vigilance." And truth cannot "become a casualty as we offer 
indemnity to political criminals in our pursuit of 
reconciliation." Murders committed to defend apartheid "cannot 
be pardoned or even considered for indemity." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  Parliament Gains New Wealth -- The Johannesburg BEELD in 
Afrikaans of 10 May in a page 10 editorial points out that "few 
generations are privileged to witness in so short a time so many 
highlights becoming instant history." "How different the 
process has been to the predictions of the prophets of doom." 
"Today we can look in the mirror and no longer see the monster 
of oppression or the skunk of apartheid, but something beautiful 
and just. Above all, something democratic, because that is the 
heartbeat of of the new beginning. No institution is holy. If 
South Africa had not reformed, Parliament and the Union 
Buildings could have eventually become the seats of a 
revolutionary regime, or useless museums standing as witness to 
the absolute stupidity of generations of Afrikaners and whites 
who refused to adapt. But now Parliament and the Union 
Buildings have gained a new use, a new wealth, new ideas which 
witness the diversity of the country." "South Africa has 
completed its transition not with revolutionary rumbling, but 
with dignity, courtesy, and respect for institutions 
representing law and order. We wish the new rulers strength and 
wisdom. Our deepest hope is that eventually all South Africans 
will enjoy the fruits of this change. Because that is the 
noblest ideal behind all the changes: to make South Africa a 
more beautiful, better, and safer place for all."

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  SUNDAY TIMES </H8>
  Stem Past Excesses -- While "few leaders come to power on 
tides of warmth and goodwill such as President Nelson Mandela 
enjoys," the "afterglow" is expected to last a "brief period" 
when "the new president must strike the major themes of his term 
of office, and win to his purpose the major constituencies of a 
complex society," an editorial in the Johannesburg SUNDAY TIMES 
in English on 15 May on page 22 notes. "The country at large has 
been caught up in social turbulance since Sharpeville, since 
before Mr Mandela went to jail. and the backwash swirls around 
him: unrealistic expectations, lingering angers and spites, 
destructive behaviour designed to make a country ungovernable 
rather than to make it succeed, and habits of dependency, 
resentment and irresponsibility." And the "greatest threat to 
the future" is the "flight of capital, the wariness of investors 
that arise from perceptions of crime, random violence, labor 
indiscipline, rampant white-collar crime, fiscal profligacy, 
ostentatious mandarism and all the other social ills the country 
inherits from the NP [National Party]." "Mr Mandela's first 
challenge is to set a different tone" and deal with a civil 
service "adept at looting, a parasite class." "Mr Mandela is the 
only leader in a generation who has had the moral stature to 
call this nation back to work, to impose a stern discipline and 
to command patience. He should not hesitate to impose on his 
administration his own instincts for order, frugality and 
propriety." 
<H8>  SUNDAY NATION </H8>
  Vigilance -- Following the inauguration last week, this 
country is "bound together with a sense of optimism about the 
future," "the unfolding process could certainly represent a 
genuine change of fortune for the country -- but only if some of 
the basic needs of the deprived majority see signs that their 
vote is working for them to usher a new era," an editorial in 
Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on May 15 on page 10 states. 
Strikes in Transkei, Bophuthatswana and among Eastern and 
Western Cape interpreters "mark the beginning of many tests 
which our newly-found freedom will be subjected to" and "further 
trouble could either be contained or be allowed to spread to 
areas like Ciskei, Venda, Lebowa and even Qwaqwa." "It is true 
that in our newly-attained democracy, the right to strike is 
part of the workers' democratic right in order to achieve their 
desired result. But this should take place in a disciplined 
fashion." "Our liberation was a costly one and we need to defend 
it with everything at our disposal. Should we relax, we should 
know that we are sitting on a powder keg which will consume all." 
<H8>  BEELD </H8>
  RSA Can Be Rainbow of Hope -- "Yesterday at the Union 
Buildings the world was witness to the formal birth of a new 
South Africa committed to justice, peace, and dignity for all 
its people," says a page 12 editorial in the Johannesburg BEELD 
in Afrikaans of 11 May. "President Nelson Mandela said after his 
inauguration before world leaders that we are a rainbow nation 
which has made peace with itself and the world. The leaders who 
cheered his statement are now morally bound to help make the new 
South Africa a success in its growth and development. But their 
role is limited. The lead will still have to be given by 
President Mandela and deputy Presidents F. W. de Klerk and Thabo 
Mbeki. However, "they cannot tackle the great task ahead alone. 
There rests on the shoulders of all of us a great 
responsibility. The people who set aside their grievances to 
stand peacefully and patiently in line to vote will now have to 
work hard to maintain peace and reconciliation, and make South 
Africa a country of security and prosperity for all its people." 
"If South Africa can achieve success, it will be a rainbow of 
hope and promise to the rest of the world." 
  Constsructive U. S. Approach Welcomed -- A second editorial 
on page 12 of BEELD argues: "The presence in South Africa of a 
high level U. S. government delegation led by Vice President Al 
Gore, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Trade Secretary Ron Brown 
is more significant that it would appear on the surface. Not 
only do they represent the most senior U. S. delegation yet to 
visit South Africa; their visit follows shortly after the 
announcement of the `Clinton Plan' of economic and social 
upliftment for South Africa involving 2.16 billion rands over 
the next 3 years. It also follows on the U. S. President's 
earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in 
the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton 
administration is busy putting words into action and reaching 
out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done. 
This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7 
countries -- could provide the spark which the South African 
economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually 
contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach 
is most welcome." 
  Police Now Serve Accepted Government -- A third editorial on 
the same page quotes Archbishop Desmond Tutu's statement in Cape 
Town on Monday that the police deserve praise for their role 
that day, and his reference to them as "our police." BEELD 
continues: "These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive 
new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African 
society." "That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South 
Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the 
force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional 
dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a 
minority government, but of a generally accepted government of 
all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the 
development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new 
symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal 
the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact, 
it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,' 
it's `our country.'"

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  PWV Provincial Cabinet Viewed -- "The ANC, entitled to seven 
out of 10 portfolios in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging], has retained the real heavy-weight positions," 
begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 May in a page 
10 editorial. "It is clear that Premier Tokyo Sexwale has borne 
in mind the party's allies -- Cosatu [Congress of South African 
Trade Unions] and the SACP [South African Communist Party] -- as 
well as SANCO [South African National Civics Organization] in 
constituting his cabinet." These men are apartheid survivors, 
"but their single-minded involvement in the struggle against 
apartheid has a down side when it comes to assuming the reins of 
power. Few have had either the training or the necessary 
experience of formal, specialised administration which would 
assist them in the task ahead." The move to provide "strategic 
management teams" to support Cabinet ministers is welcomed, but 
delivering on election promises is what will make or break the 
government. 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Budget Priorities for New Government -- "This week one of 
the 
toughest tasks of government begins in earnest -- finalising the 
settling of spending priorities ahead of next month's national 
budget," states the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 
May in a page 12 editorial. ANC economic officials want to be 
judged by the 1995/96 budget, but the 94/95 budget "will 
nevertheless provide some early indications of what is to come." 
The rest of the editorial questions whether Minister Without 
Portfolio Jay Naidoo is "equipped" to coordinate the 
Reconstruction and Development Program with other ministers. 
  Democratic Party's "Devastating Blow" in Election -- 
"Despite 
the support of the bulk of the English language Press, the 
Democratic Party [DP] was comprehensively rejected at the 
polls," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 
May in a page 12 editorial. "It was a devastating blow to a 
party that so often stood alone in its dedication to democracy 
itself. It played an important role, not only in opposing 
apartheid in the dark years but in championing the rights of the 
individual in the shaping of the interim constitution. Yet it 
was defeated by what DP chairman Ken Andrew correctly described 
as the forces of history -- the ANC and the National Party." 
Continuing the editorial states that "there is no reason why it 
should not establish itself again as a voice commanding 
respect." "Zach de Beer's departure gives the party the chance 
to make a fresh start."

<F P=106> [Article by Marc Roche: "Decartelization an Optical </F>
Illusion"] 
  [Text] The multinationals that control 80 percent of the 
shares on the Johannesburg stock exchange have prepared 
themselves for the country's first multiracial elections. 
Ostensibly, to make the transition to economic power sharing. In 
reality, to shelter their assets.... 
  London--"We must encourage participation of South Africa's 
blacks in the mining and financial groups; it can only be 
beneficial to all sides." For the Anglo-American Corporation, 
the 30 March announcement of the dismantling of the cartel's 
Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company (JCI) subsidiary 
marks an historic step on the road to "the new South Africa." A 
new leaf, oh yes, by all that's holy! "Anglo" directors swear up 
and down that the break-up of the large industrial group--which 
encompasses independent entities in such diverse domains as 
gold, coal, agrofood, the press, and breweries--is bound to 
create many jobs at every level that are open to blacks. 
  But serious London analysts of the South African economy are 
not fooled: "Modification of the corporate structure and the 
opening of a few companies amount to nothing more than the 
business community throwing a few scraps to Mandela. It is a 
phony dismemberment that does not redistribute any national 
wealth to black entrepreneurs," opines one city expert. Julian 
Ogilvie Thompson, current president of Anglo-American and de 
Beers, has already taken the precaution of purchasing JCI's 
highly lucrative platinum division and its 16-percent interest 
in de Beers, the world's biggest diamond firm. 
  The extraordinary high-wire maneuvering by South Africa's 
big 
multinationals in preparation for the first multiracial 
elections has led entrepreneurs--English-speakers and 
Afrikaners--to coin a new term: unbundling [preceding word in 
English] (literally, decartelization). Does it amount to a 
cultural revolution, with white businesses cooperating in 
economic power sharing and agreeing to be melted down into the 
new mold? Or is it all a conjuring trick, allowing a handful of 
groups to continue controlling the economy? 
  Appearances would tend to support the former version, but 
the truth is probably closer to the latter. 
<H5>  Mastodons </H5>
  Anglo-American-de Beers; Rembrandt Group; Old Mutual; 
Sanlam; 
Liberty Life.... Whenever one thinks about the South African 
economy, the temptation is to identify it with these five 
groups, which like all-devouring octopi control between them 80 
percent of the stock on the Johannesburg exchange. These 
ubiquitous mastodons hold interests in every domain and have 
swollen to enormous size through acquisitions. 
  For a very long time, the ultrastrict controls on foreign 
exchange (through the intermediating mechanism of a dual market 
for the South African rand), which prevented them from investing 
abroad, constrained these giants to invest in sectors quite 
remote from where they started. Their structure is pyramidal, 
via holding companies at the top that have permitted a handful 
of great families such as Oppenheimer, Rupert, and Gordon to 
keep control over their assets without holding a majority of 
their subsidiaries' stock. As defenders see it, such a financial 
system protects the companies against hostile takeover bids, 
inspires confidence in the banking sector, and makes it easier 
to raise the capital needed for large investment projects, 
notably in mining and mineral exploration. 
  Until just recently, Brian Gilbertson headed a shadowy group 
known as Gencor. A year ago, Sankorp, the investment holding 
company, itself a subsidiary of the Sanlam insurance company, 
granted "independence" to four of Gencor's subsidiaries: Malback 
(pharmacy), Sappi (lumber industry), Engen (oil refining), and 
Genbel (finance). 
  This "vertical" dismemberment was effected to enable Gencor, 
the world's largest producer of platinum and second-largest 
producer of gold, to shift the focus back to its mining 
activities. To hear its president talk, the break-up came in 
response solely to the financial imperative of reducing the 
incongruous disparity between the relatively weak stock market 
performance of the subsidiaries and the stronger performance of 
the conglomerate's stock. 
  This capital restructuring was also intended to allay the 
apprehensions of big American and British institutional 
investors, which distrust conglomerates that are too complex. 
"These massive, hypercentralized conglomerates are real 
dinosaurs that no longer have a place on the contemporary 
economic landscape, since their boards of directors cannot 
really be made accountable to shareholders," says Steve Oke of 
the Smith New Court firm. 
  But what is most intriguing is the political significance of 
this far-reaching restructuring. Sankorp, for example, sold its 
10-percent interest in an insurance company to an insurance 
group, Methold, held by black interests. The ANC, after being 
consulted discreetly by Finance Minister Derek Keys, Gencor's 
CEO from 1986 to 1991, gave the green light. 
<H5>  Offshore </H5>
  But to infer from this that South Africa's future will be 
one 
of sweetness and light.... Well, as commentators have pointed 
out, most of the recent dismantlings--with Gencor the major 
exception--have led to the creation of extraterritorial offshore 
vehicles intended primarily to protect overseas holdings. Such 
is the case with Anglo-American, which controls nearly 40 
percent of de Beers, which itself controls about 30 percent of 
the former. In October 1993, Anglo-American transferred all its 
non-South African interests except for diamonds to a "screen" 
company, Minorco, 75 percent of whose stock is held by the 
Oppenheimer family. Established about two decades ago as a 
portfolio company, Minorco has become a mining enterprise in its 
own right. "Well played! Thanks to Minorco, which is now its 
secular arm overseas, Anglo-American can present itself as a 
purely African operator. Anglo can tell Mandela that all its 
investments are either local or in neighboring countries," says 
one observer. 
<H5>  Skepticism </H5>
  As for de Beers, it founded the Zurich-based de Beers 
Centenary AG, which has acquired synthetic diamond fabrication 
plants, financial interests in several holding companies, and 
quantities of diamonds from the Central Selling Organization in 
London. For its part, de Beers Consolidated Mines retains only 
South African interests. The two companies are run by the same 
man, Julian Ogilvie Thompson, and have the same board of 
directors--and shares in them cannot be purchased separately on 
the stock exchange. 
  South Africa's second biggest industrial house, the Rupert 
family, has a Swiss holding company, Richemont (established 
1988), that controls foreign assets, notably the maker of 
Rothmans cigarettes and luxury brands Cartier and Alfred 
Dunhill. South African assets are managed by a separate company, 
Rembrandt. Johann Rupert, the founder's son, holds only an 
honorary title as director of Richemont, but he keeps close 
watch on the illustrious luxury companies it manages. He's 
always levelheaded and ready for dialogue with the ANC, but firm 
and even intransigent when it comes to the essentials: the 
interests of his group. It is the same with Nicky Oppenheimer, 
who is "only" vice president of Anglo and de Beers but keeps 
close tabs on titular director Julian Ogilvie Thompson. 
  These maneuvers by the white capitalists have been greeted 
with skepticism in London. Some observers have pointed out that 
while the word nationalization may be banned from ANC's 
vocabulary now, Nelson Mandela's party has vowed to break the 
mining oligopolies with antitrust legislation. But only a wizard 
could say when and how any new regulations might force these 
national "institutions" to give up any of their wealth. 
  Given the great danger of economic paralysis in South 
Africa, 
the enormity of the task awaiting the new government team, and 
the commercial inexperience and financial weakness of potential 
black shareholders, analysts are under no illusions: The era of 
the great South African cartels has not yet ended.

<F P=106> [Article by M. de V.: "De Beers, the Untouchable"] </F>
  [Text] Founded more than a century ago, this conglomerate 
with a world monopoly on the diamond trade remains faithful to 
itself: secretive, hegemonic, paternalistic, and sure of its 
future... 
  "I know from experience that the only possible way to 
safeguard the stability of the sector is by limiting the supply 
of diamonds and selling through a single distribution network," 
Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, president of de Beers at the turn of the 
century, used to say. Faithful to itself, and faithful to this 
principle, the conglomerate founded in 1888 by Cecil 
Rhodes--creator of Rhodesia, obsessed by Great Britain's 
expansion into Africa--owns half the world's production of uncut 
diamonds and markets 80 percent. 
  Since 1931, diamonds have escaped the almost constant 
erosion 
of prices of other raw materials. A miraculous survivor among 
luxury products, this "king of gems" and "teardrop of the gods" 
is still in insolently good health; and de Beers, a fairly 
accurate gauge of the industry's condition since it holds the 
monopoly on diamonds, is in equally excellent shape: The group's 
turnover for 1993 was $4.444 billion, compared to $3.640 the 
preceding year. In this recessionary period, it is probably the 
only one to have recorded "record sales," and it displays a 
serenity and faith in its own future that would be the envy of 
many other companies. 
  Its assurance is expressed in more than mere words: de Beers 
is making long-term investments, on several fronts, with 
astonishing audacity: in the conquest of new markets--its budget 
for this is almost unequalled anywhere--in consolidation--with 
all its uncertainties!--in agreements with producer countries, 
in exploring new deposits, and above all in constantly keeping 
supply in balance with demand--even when stocks are 
excessive...and cost is no object. 
  Zaire thinks it is independent enough to start selling 
stones 
directly to Israeli diamond cutters? Well, then, de Beers just 
signs an exclusive contract with Israel and buys them up itself. 
The guerrillas in Angola have decided to go into the diamond 
business? It spends $400 million to block the deal. Russia 
"forgets" the protocols it signed? It renegotiates, slowly but 
surely convincing the backsliders--by what means?--to get back 
in line, i.e., the de Beers line. In addition, it monitors and 
controls the distribution system with such arrogant precision 
that it sells to its clients "only as much as is likely to be 
sold." It prefers to hoard all the rest, to make sure the 
cutters do not warehouse too much merchandise. 
<H5>  Hegemony </H5>
  Does de Beers behave like a sovereign government? Is it 
authoritarian, even hegemonic, behind its velvet facade? 
Certainly. But one must admit it has succeeded where 
international agreements and producer cartels have failed. 
Secretive--it seems to keep key information under wraps as part 
of its power strategy--and paternalistic, it is reaping the 
fruits of its founders' vision. 
  What did Harry Oppenheimer, son of Ernest, say back in 1948? 
"All workers should participate in the success of their business 
and should benefit directly from its profits; apartheid, which 
amounts to disguised slavery in the mines, can lead only to 
impasse." And he supported the creation of miners' unions in the 
sector. Because stable labor relations, as he saw it, were key 
to steady production. 
  So de Beers today is cultivating "courteous" relations with 
Mandela's entourage. In that regard, it is significant that the 
former secretary general of the miners' union, Cyril Ramaphosa, 
number-two man in the ANC, is the announced successor to Mandela. 
  This attractive blend of fine-tuned philanthropy and 
judicious liberalism is characteristic of de Beers. Neither 
Cecil Rhodes nor the Oppenheimer dynasty would take offense at 
the charming words the company's current president has to say 
about Mandela. Because the company has already taken appropriate 
precautions to protect its wealth: In 1990, when the ANC 
revealed its intent to nationalize South African companies, de 
Beers immediately transferred its capital to Lucerne, 
Switzerland. 
  In South Africa itself, nothing remains but the extraction 
company (de Beers Consolidated Mines, Ltd.). Whatever happens in 
South African politics, Julian Ogilvie Thompson can still sleep 
soundly on a pillow of diamonds.

<F P=106> [Article by Serge Marti: "A Market of 115 Million </F>
Inhabitants"] 
  [Text] Installed to collect information needed in the 
struggle against the communist enemy back in the Cold War days, 
the computers at the Silvermine defense intelligence station 
situated near the Simon's Town naval base, about 20 km from the 
Cape of Good Hope, are now obsolete. But the "Cape route" for 
shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still 
of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset. 
Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the 
country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a 
gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural 
outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access 
to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. 
  Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international 
isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of "separate 
development," South Africa also has become a true regional 
economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has 
50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it 
furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the 
steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent, 
and provides half its industrial production. 
  Now that the country is committed to the path of 
democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside 
world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial 
inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to 
its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies 
that might emerge in the "new South Africa." 
  The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently 
articulated by experts on the region--"Southern Africa stands to 
South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to 
Germany, if Germany were all Europe had"--is trying once again 
to evoke that "Afro-optimism," which so often miscarried in the 
past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency. 
And it dares to hope that this "politico-socio-economic 
laboratory" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment) 
toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory 
situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and 
Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a 
generation---will be the engine of economic development that 
sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. "Nigeria and South 
Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing 
the African continent," says one observer familiar with these 
countries. 
  It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its 
neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent) 
of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking 
orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a 
recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak. 
All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned 
over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline 
states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will 
expand among the southern African countries with their combined 
population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million 
potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of 
their respective countries might grow. 
<H5>  Regional Integration </H5>
  The next phase should be real regional integration, in 
stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role 
now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis 
advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics 
instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South 
Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for 
Mandela's ANC. 
  "Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination 
from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help 
them expand their own economies," he says. This white official, 
head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the 
theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in 
collaboration with the ANC's "external trade relations" team and 
representatives of the southern African countries. 
  This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see 
the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the 
other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation 
with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product 
areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity. 
"There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors 
that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia, 
Botswana, and Zimbabwe," one expert confirmed. 
  On the South African side, the "Mandela team," and hence the 
future government of national union, although describing itself 
as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does 
not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour, 
amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the 
ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. "We do 
want access to other markets besides Europe and southern 
Africa," says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made 
contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation 
[MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting 
was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of 
regional accords now in force will have to be revised. 
  These agreements come in several different forms, from 
simple 
free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of 
what might evolve into a regional common market--"our own 
version of the European Union," as President de Klerk puts it. 
Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary 
union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a 
South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa, 
Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and 
Swaziland. 
  In addition to these monetary and customs institutions, 
there 
are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these 
is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central 
and east African countries but until now has excluded South 
Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination 
Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe 
has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African 
Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political 
past behind it. 
<H5>  Immigration Issue </H5>
  In all likelihood, the future integration of the region, 
with 
Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do 
not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future. 
"Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region 
are probably exaggerated," says the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's 
future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. "The 
private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the 
region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of 
investments in South Africa itself," add the authors of the 
article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own 
internal problems before anything else. 
  One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from 
neighboring countries, which certainly will add new 
complications to future commercial or economic negotiations 
among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time 
ago that South Africa could not afford to become "the job market 
for the entire region." More bluntly, his entourage has openly 
admitted it will be necessary to "deport 2 million undesirables" 
hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future 
government of national union may adopt legislation to this end. 
  Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year 
for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt 
Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some 
"tried-and-true" prescriptions in this domain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mr. Wally Serote, ANC's Cultural </F>
Affairs Chief, by Philip de Bruin; place and date not given: 
"Government Should Bring Cultures Together; White South Africans 
Are Concerned About the Future of Cultural Heritage and 
Symbols"] 
  [Text] "The top priority in my department is to see to it 
that South Africa acquires a minister of art and culture. 
  "Historically speaking, South Africa has three cultural 
pillars--that of the whites, that of the Indians, and that of 
the blacks. Our task is to ensure that these three cultural 
groups cooperate to such a degree that a distinctive South 
African culture is created. 
  "To attain this goal, my department has already set up a 
commission of reconstruction to determine, among other things, 
what we can do to stimulate art and culture in the townships and 
the rural areas, for this is where most of the people are. 
  "We must begin with the premise that every person has the 
right to live in accordance with his own culture and to express 
its outward manifestations. We must accept the fact that every 
individual has the right to use his own language. 
  "If, for example, I want to speak Afrikaans, then I speak 
Afrikaans, without apologizing to anyone. 
  "The role of the government will simply be to bring the 
cultural groups together and to correct imbalances in the 
community. There are no organized cultural activities in black 
neighborhoods, for example. This state of affairs must be 
remedied. 
  "But in the final analysis, the people have to play the most 
important role. All the people of the nation must reach 
consensus about how the imbalances of apartheid are to be put 
right." 
  The ANC has definite plans concerning the continued 
existence 
of monuments and museums. 
  "The first question that has to be asked is whether the 
museum in question is to have national, regional, or group 
status. 
  "We are aware of the sensitivity and emotional content of 
such issues, but everyone has to accept the fact that changes 
are going to be made. 
  "What, for example, is to become of Robben Island? Our 
contention is that it should become a monument that can serve as 
a symbol of the struggle against discrimination that was waged 
there. 
  "The museums that now exist are not representative of the 
entire population. We want to change museums in places where 
people can see not only objects from the past, but also 
present-day items. Museums must be alive. There must be 
restaurants. People from the various population groups must get 
to know one another there. 
  "Then there is the whole question of symbolism and statuary. 
The government must consult with the people of the nation on 
this score. All the people of the country must be convinced of 
the fact that all symbols and statues belong to everyone. This 
does not mean that the Voortrekker Monument or the statue of 
President Paul Kruger in Church Square, Pretoria will come 
crashing down after 27 April. 
  "My feeling is that such monuments and statues must be left 
as they are. The question is simply this: Can they always be 
recognized as national symbols? Speaking of the Voortrekker 
Monument, I believe that this is not the case. Existing 
monuments and statues will only be eliminated if absolutely 
necessary." 
  What about the names of symbols, cities or streets that 
remind us of the apartheid era, such as the town of Verwoerdburg? 
  "This is once again a case where a new government must 
consult with the people of the nation concerning whether or not 
such names have an offensive content." 
  Concerning the future of Afrikaans in a country with eleven 
official languages, Mr. Serote says that negotiations between 
the ANC and the government for the establishment of a language 
council are in progress. "We shall have to examine how each 
language is used in each province, how it is used in education, 
the media, and the world of work? 
  "But if I wish to speak Afrikaans in parliament, I must be 
able to do so. If you go to see your doctor, you must be able to 
communicate with him in the language of your choice. All people 
feel strongly about their language. We must respect their 
feelings. 
  "This holds true for education as well. An 
Afrikaans-speaking 
child must receive his instruction in Afrikaans. 
  Concerning the question of a national flag and anthem, Mr. 
Serote says: "The ANC has put certain proposals before the 
Executive Transitional Council, and the council has to make 
decisions in this respect. Our proposal is that a new flag has 
to symbolize unity in South Africa. 
  "Furthermore we have recommended six colors: green, yellow, 
red, white, blue, and black. 
  "With respect to a new national anthem, the ANC has yet to 
make its final proposals. Whether "The Voice" will survive is a 
question that is still under discussion."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Cultural Danger"] </F>
  [Text] The cultural attitude of the ANC, as expounded in an 
interview with BEELD, is most disturbing and should incite all 
cultural organizations to take action. For it represents a 
school of thought that endangers the free exercise of culture. 
It is also a disavowal of principles in the new constitution. 
  Wally Serote, the ANC cultural leader, says that 
organizations that exclude those who are not members of a 
certain racial or language group--such as the Messengers, the 
Junior Messengers, and the Dynamic Young Ladies--will not be 
tolerated in a new South Africa under an ANC government. Their 
days are numbered, for this is discrimination. 
  We should like to refer Mr. Serote to Article 3 of the new 
constitution. This deals with fundamental rights and declares 
among other things that: "Every person has the right to freedom 
of association." 
  This simply means that one has the right to associate with 
other people, a woman with other women, an Afrikaner with other 
Afrikaners, a Zulu with other Zulus, etc. Of course, groups will 
also have the right to be formed along language lines. This has 
nothing to do with degrading discrimination, but everything to 
do with the right of people to protect and expand their own 
cultural inheritance. 
  To the best of our knowledge, all Afrikaner cultural 
organizations (except those of the rightists) are in the process 
of eliminating racial restrictions, so that such discrimination 
no longer exists. 
  The Serote standard would imply that Jewish organizations 
must close their doors, that a male chorus can no longer exist 
(discrimination against women!), that the hundreds or thousands 
of women's clubs in the country are inappropriate, etc. What 
absurdity! And what a weakening of cultural distinctions will it 
not indicate! 
  If this is the kind of thinking that is at the heart of the 
ANC, the entire cultural life of the nation is threatened. Such 
a policy has the potential of turning South Africa into another 
Bosnia--far more than do any other controversial ANC policies 
such as nationalization, for example.

  [Text] According to the ETHIOPIAN NEWS AGENCY, two 
officials of the former regime, now in custody following 
deportation from Djibouti, showed no repentance for the 
atrocities they had committed during the reign of terror. In an 
interview with the organ of the Amhara Nation's Democratic 
Movement, Major Melaku Tefera and Maj. Begashaw Atalay said they 
had nothing to speak with regret about as everything they had 
done under the leadership of the revolution enjoyed the full 
support of the populace. 
  Maj. Begashaw said on his part he was committed to fight to 
the last drop of his blood for the success of the revolution 
that provided full answers to what he described as the pertinent 
questions of the day. He expressed satisfaction over what he 
described as efforts of the private press to reflect the 
objective realities in the country. He said journalists of the 
private press have to keep on reflecting what he termed as 
realities, despite pressures under which he said they perform 
their journalistic duties. 
  Asked whether their rights were voiced by prison officials, 
they said they had no complaints and thanked the authorities for 
cooperation with their families who, they said, often came to 
see them in detention.

affairs and international cooperation, Mr. Stephen K. Musyoka, 
today said that the second session of the formal discussions on 
the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development 
[IGADD] peace initiative on southern Sudan have been rescheduled 
for tomorrow, 17th May 1994, and not today as anticipated. In a 
signed statement issued this evening, Mr. Musyoka said: "The 
standing committee of IGADD foreign affairs ministers met on 
Monday, 16th May 1994 for the second negotiation session of the 
Sudan peace talks. The ministers held consultations concerning 
the procedures on the conduct of the negotiations, whose agenda 
was agreed on 23rd March 1994. 
  The Sudanese Government and the Sudanese People's Liberation 
Movement/Army [SPLM/A]-United delegations are already in Nairobi 
for the talks. However, the SPLM/A faction could not arrive as 
was anticipated due to logistical problems. For this reason, 
the formal discussions have been rescheduled to begin on 
Tuesday, 17th May, 1994, instead of today, as earlier agreed."

  [Text] A Somali National Alliance [SNA] spokesman has

airport as baseless lies and intended to stir up instability. 
He added that on 17 May [as heard] 1994 at about 1300 fire was 
exchanged between UN Operation in Somalia forces from Nepal and 
armed gangs who were stealing the vehicles these forces were 
using around the airport. Since then the SNA has been busy 
investigating the incident and extent of the damage. 
  In conclusion, the spokesman clearly said that the alliance 
has no connection with that incident and was very sorry about 
the deaths of the three Nepalese soldiers confirmed so far. He 
said he was sending condolence messages to the relations, 
families, and the Government of Nepal who lost their soldiers.

<F P=106> [Article signed GVL: "Twagiramungu: `The RPF Is Respecting </F>
Arusha' -- Rwandan Opposition Parties Want To Cooperate With the 
Rebels"] 
  [Excerpts] Four Rwandan opposition parties (namely the MDR 
[Republican Democratic Movement], the PSD [Democratic Socialist 
Party], the PL [Liberal Party], and the PDC [Christian 
Democratic Party]) have set up a Coordination Committee of the 
Democratic Forces of Change (CCFDC) [Comite de Coordination des 
Forces Democratiques de Changement] in Brussels intended as a 
counterbalance to the interim government, which is now putting 
itself forward as the legal representation, but which according 
to the CCFDC is largely responsible for the slaughter. [passage 
omitted]. 
<H5>  Twagiramungu </H5>
  The CCFDC is headed by the MDR's Faustin Twagiramungu, who, 
according to the Arusha peace agreements, should have led the 
transition government (which was to include the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front]). However, partly due to the delaying tactics 
of Habyarimana, the transition government never came into being, 
although today it constitutes the only legal basis in Rwanda. 
Yesterday [13 May], Twagiramungu, who himself barely escaped 
death and was smuggled out of Kigali by the Blue Helmets, 
presented the viewpoints of the CCFDC. He left no doubt that 
the interim government, and more specifically the MRND [National 
Republican Movement for Democracy and Development] and the CDR 
[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic] are responsible for 
the slaughter of the Tutsi minority and of political opponents 
carried out by "the Presidential Guard, the army, the 
gendarmerie, and the Interahamwe [Coalition for the Defense of 
the Republic militia] ." 
  Among other things, the CCFDC is demanding that the 
Presidential Guard be disbanded and that the group of extremist 
army officers be arrested. It is calling for those officers and 
noncommissioned officers who are not directly involved in the 
slaughter to "come to the aid of the people and eliminate the 
criminals." 
  According to Twagiramungu, the interim government has no 
legitimacy. Not only does its composition violate the Arusha 
agreement, but according to Twagiramungu, "it does not even 
comply with the 1991 constitution. The current `president' has 
not sworn any oath before Parliament, and the parties have never 
approved their members' participation in government." It is 
precisely that constitution, which dates from before Arusha, 
which the interim government is referring to as its legal basis. 
<H5>  Patriotic Front </H5>
  Twagiramungu's rejection of the interim government 
contrasted 
sharply with his support for the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which 
according to him "is respecting the Arusha agreements" and "was 
acting in self-defense "when it resorted to arms again."

  [Text] President Sam Nujoma of Namibia made a brief 
stopover in Accra this morning on his way to Belgium for a state 
visit. He was met at the airport by the vice president, Mr. 
K.N. Arkaah. 
  President Nujoma told newsmen that Belgium played a key role 
in Namibia's struggle for independence. He recalled that in 
1972 and 1986, SWAPO [South West African People's Organization] 
organized international conferences to solicit support from the 
international community for the liberation struggle and Belgium 
readily came to her aid. According to the Namibian leader, he 
is going to Belgium to meet friends and consolidate their 
relationship. He said Namibia has a lot of raw materials while 
Belgium has technology. Both countries can, therefore, enter 
into viable ventures. 
  President Nujoma said Namibia will also consolidate her 
relationship with South Africa to ensure regional economic 
unity. He noted that South Africa is a big country with a large 
population and will be expected to play a major role in 
consolidating African economic community. On Rwanda, President 
Nujoma said the tragedy in that country calls for international 
intervention. He stressed the need for the United Nations to 
cooperate with the OAU to restore peace.

<F P=106> [Interview with Alpha Conde, secretary general of the Rally </F>
of the Guinean People, by Africa No. 1 correspondent Jean de 
Dieu Ndong Ovono; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Conde] The situation in Guinea is deadlocked on 
the political, social, financial, and economic levels. There is 
a deadlock on the political level because no new government has 
been formed since the elections. The old one is still in place. 
Now when everyone is expecting a cabinet reshuffle, no minister 
works. The president himself said on television that Guinean 
ministers do not believe in God and that they spend all their 
time consulting fetish priests as they do not know whether they 
will remain ministers or not. So ministers do not work and 
neither do civil servants. Civil servants no longer obey their 
ministers because they could also become ministers in future. 
The administration, therefore, is not functioning properly and 
political life has come to a standstill. 
  On the financial level, an IMF team visited the country in 
March but no agreement was signed, so there is also a deadlock 
at that level. On the economic level, investors have recently 
hesitated to invest in the country because of insecurity, 
corruption within the legal system, lawlessness, and an 
administration bogged down by bureaucracy. Coupled with this, 
political uncertainty does not augur well for the economy, so 
there are no investments. On the social level, people's living 
conditions have worsened terribly, especially in the informal 
sector. Petty traders and others have had their shops damaged 
and vandalized without any compensation.... 
  [Ovono, interrupting] Do you not think that the opposition 
is 
partly to blame for this political, economic, and social 
deadlock since the government, and indeed President Conte, have 
made an effort by inviting the opposition to become part of a 
national union government? 
  [Conde] I think it is a double-edged invitation because 
since 
the elections, extremist elements within the presidential group 
have forced President Lansana Conte to brutally suppress Rally 
of the Guinean People [RPG] activists. In Haute-Guinee and 
Guinee-Forestiere Regions, RPG activists have been arrested, 
imprisoned, beaten, and asked to pay heavy fines so it is rather 
confrontation that the authorities have extended to us. [passage 
omitted]. In our view, the government is doing everything 
possible to destroy the RPG but, thank God, the more RPG 
activists are suppressed, the more determined they become. 
  [Ovono] Do you not believe that as a member of the national 
union government, you, as the RPG leader, could help to end this 
state of affairs? 
  [Conde] You know, people engage in politics for two reasons: 
They do so either because they have an ideal [words indistinct] 
or because they are bread and butter minded and therefore fight 
for a portfolio or for a presidential seat. The RPG is a party 
that is fighting for an ideal. This ideal, which remains the 
same, is the fight for democratic change in Guinea and the 
establishment of the rule of law for sound and rigorous 
management of state affairs: in other words, the fight against 
all forms of corruption and ethnocentrism. We can join in the 
management of state affairs only if this will help achieve this 
ideal. Of course, we try to avoid excesses; we do not want 
clashes because we do not want a civil war. That is why I said I 
did not come to govern cemeteries; but that does not mean we are 
going to accept just anything. We are not bread and butter 
minded, that is, we are not ready to give up our ideals for 
material gains. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The security situation in Liberia seems to be going 
from bad to worse. The two splinter groups in the ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] faction have 
failed to resolve their leadership dispute. The Liberia Peace 
Council has been on the offensive against Charles Taylor's NPFL 
[National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeast. And now 
the commander of the Armed Forces of Liberia, AFL, has come out 
with a strong complaint about how Taylor's forces have been 
behaving at the Firestone rubber plantation some 30 miles from 
the capital. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this 
report: 
  General Hezekiah Bowen today threatened to turn Liberia into 
another Kigali if heavily armed NPFL fighters do not vacate 
Harbel and stop their attacks on AFL soldiers patrolling the 
area. Bowen told newsmen at his headquarters in Monrovia that 
fighters of Charles Taylor's National Patriotic Front, currently 
occupying certain strategic areas in and around Harbel, are 
constantly disarming AFL soldiers on assignment there. Bowen 
said the latest incidents of the NPFL troops moving into Harbel 
occurred last Friday [13 May] when an AFL sergeant was disarmed 
by 10 child soldiers from the NPFL. The child soldiers then 
seized their Firestone rubber plantation's company vehicle. 
Gen. Bowen said that some of the Firestone employees were 
undressed and kicked and had their personal effects taken away 
leaving them only in their underpants. 
  According to Bowen, NPFL fighters told the Firestone workers 
that the company can only operate with the approval of Charles 
Taylor. If this situation is not properly addressed by ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group], said Bowen, the world should not be surprise to see the 
AFL bitterly engaging the NPFL in a battle that could turn 
Liberia into another Kigali. He claimed that the influx of NPFL 
troops in Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious risk 
to the AFL barracks at Schieffelin, as well as to Monrovia, and 
if they are not cleared from the area we, said Bowen, will go to 
war soon. 
  Meanwhile, NPFL leader Charles Taylor said on Saturday [14 
May] that he would no longer carry on disarming and handing in 
weapons to ECOMOG. They, he said, are not neutral. A Gbarnga 
Radio broadcast monitored here said that Taylor had accused 
Nigerian elements among the peacekeepers of gun running between 
the two ULIMO factions and the Liberian Peace Council which is 
battling with the NPFL for control of southeatern Liberia.

  [Text] The chief of staff of the Armed Forces of Liberia 
[AFL], Lieutenant General J. Hezekiah Bowen, has expressed 
serious concern over the movement of armed NPFL [National 
Patriotic Front of Liberia] troops in large numbers into the 
East Harbel area. Gen. Bowen said the infiltration of these 
troops into Harbel and its surrounding areas poses a serious 
security risk to the city of Monrovia. 
  In another development, a pickup belonging to the Firestone 
Plantation Company was reportedly seized by fighters of the NPFL 
in Harbel after putting the AFL driver at a gunpoint. Gen. 
Bowen told reporters that all efforts to retrieve the pickup and 
the arm seized from the AFL driver proved futile. He is 
therefore calling on ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] and UNOMIL [UN Observer 
Mission in Liberia] to intervene. Meanwhile, ECOMOG authorities 
say a peacekeeping force has already been deployed in Harbel. 
They are advising residents not to panic as ECOMOG troops are 
fully in control of the situation.

  [Text] The Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG] 
has lauded the efforts of the Economic Community of West African 
States [ECOWAS], ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]- 
contributing countries, the United Nations, and the 
international community for the human and material sacrifices 
they continue to make in restoring peace to Liberia. 
  In a statement issued at the end of the first cabinet 
meeting 
of the State Council and its cabinet, (?it called on) the United 
States Government, the European Community, and other countries 
to extend full diplomatic recognition to the Liberian 
Government. The government said this will strengthen the LNTG 
and advance the peace process. 
  In a related development, the LNTG is calling on the leaders 
of warring factions and armed combatants to unconditionally 
surrender all their arms and other implements of war to ECOMOG. 
The Liberian Government's call is in consonance with its recent 
declaration of full authority over the entire country made at 
its first cabinet meeting on Friday [13 May]. The cabinet's 
statement has pointed out that with all components of the 
transitional government -- that is, the State Council, the 
Transitional Legislative Assembly, the Judiciary, and the ad hoc 
Election Commission -- fully constituted and functioning, the 
LNTG is now the governing authority of Liberia, effectively 
ending all factional claims to territory. 
  Meanwhile, the cabinet has expressed appreciation to the 
leaders of parties to the Cotonou Accord for the cooperation and 
sense of compromise that led to the creation of the LNTG and 
also leaders of armed factions not signatories to the accord for 
their recognition of, cooperation with, and commitment to the 
LNTG and the peace process.

  [Text] The National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL] says 
it will maintain its noninterference stance on internal matters 
of other parties to the Liberian conflict. The NPFL says it 
believes as the parties still exist in the transitional 
government, it remains their prerogative to make positive moves 
to achieve peace and reconciliation at all levels. 
  The NPFL is reacting to reported fears that the front and 
other factions may object to changes in the composition of ULIMO 
[United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
representatives to the Liberian National Transitional 
Government. The NPFL says it has no objection whatsoever to any 
change within the rank and file of a faction to stop the 
bloodshed and bring about peace and unity.

  [Excerpt] As the campaign for the formation of a standing 
national transitional army for Liberia continues, the leadership 
of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], the largest 
faction in the conflict, says it is prepared to provide 2,500 
men for the standing army. The leader of the NPFL, President 
Charles Gankay Taylor, said both ULIMO [United Liberation 
Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and the AFL [Armed Forces of 
Liberia] could provide 1,500 men each to beef up the 
transitional army. He said the three factions in Liberia 
already have trained men and only need to get together for 
better acquaintance. We can begin providing uniforms and 
equipment for our own army, President Taylor continued. 
  The former NPRAG [National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly 
Government] president said: There is a dire need to form a 
transitional army in order to constitutionally safeguard the 
territorial integrity and sovereignty of Liberia. He said the 
alien military force, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], dominated by Nigerian armed 
aggressors, have demonstrated their inability to stop the 
Liberian crisis by directly facilitating war. 
  President Taylor said: It is constitutionally improper for a 
government to be in place without a protecting army of its own. 
The NPFL leader cited revelations of direct Nigerian-ECOMOG 
support for LPC [Liberia Peace Council] bandits in southeastern 
Liberia and expressed regret that while there was a cease-fire 
in place, the so-called peacekeepers were still waging war on 
the people of Liberia. He noted that the mission of the NPFL to 
restore democracy, justice, and peace has still not been 
accomplished. 
  The CIC [commander in chief] then commended senior officers 
and commanders of the NPFL for their bravery and sacrifices and 
repeated the commitment of the NPFL to continue to abide by the 
Cotonou Accord, despite its imperfections, as a way of moving 
the peace process forward. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Workers of the Niger Electric Power Company 
[NIGELEC] began a 48-hour strike this morning. Their main 
grievance concerns the rate of increase applicable to 
electricity. The strike notice provided for minimum services, 
but this has not been not complied with so far. Saidu Mossi has 
a report. 
  [Mossi] It is not easy to have a clear picture. What is 
certain is that NIGELEC, in view of the financial problems 
confronting it, needs to increase the kilowatt per hour rate. 
However, the management and National Electricity Workers Union 
[SYNATREN] have been unable to agree on an acceptable increase. 
Management is said to have proposed a rate that is not 
satisfactory to the NIGELEC workers. There is talk of a 30 to 
40-percent increase while the SYNATREN is asking for more. The 
various rounds of negotiations have not succeeded in easing the 
situation, hence the 48-hour strike notice issued by the 
SYNATREN on 5 May. 
  The strike notice stated that there will be temporary power 
cuts, however since this morning, there has been no electricity 
at all. The arrangements stated in the strike notice are no 
longer being implemented and there is a general power cut. The 
NIGELEC workers have adopted a harder stand because the NIGELEC 
management in the meantime requisitioned some of the workers, 
hence the SYNATREN's anger. At the moment, a meeting is being 
held between the union leaders and management but we do not have 
any details on it. 
  Meanwhile, NIGELEC's 46,000 customers do not have any 
electricity at all. Many offices and businesses are blocked 
because of the power cut and people are wondering why the 
NIGELEC workers are asking for increases in electricity rates 
when the devaluation is making the cost of living increasingly 
unbearable. Besides, today's 40 degrees in the shade in Niamey 
is not going to cheer people up.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Most of the Nigerian newspapers today report the 
formation of a new pressure group known as the National 
Democratic Coalition, NADECO, by a group of eminent Nigerian 
politicians, retired military officers, human rights activists, 
and business executives. The papers say the new group is 
opposed to the planned constitutional conference by the present 
military regime in Nigeria. The papers, CHAMPION, GUARDIAN, 
VANGUARD, and the NATIONAL CONCORD, report the story differently. 
  Ajasin, Ukiwe, Others Oppose Parley: that is the CHAMPION. 
The paper reports that Nigeria's second in command in the early 
days of the former administration of General Babangida, Retired 
Navy Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe; a former civilian governor of Ondo 
State, Chief Adekunle Ajasin; and Malam (Lawan Dimbazo) have 
spoken against the holding of the constitutional conference 
scheduled to begin next month. According to the paper, they 
launched their opposition to the conference at the weekend 
because they felt the conference was ill-conceived and would 
only amount to a waste of public funds since nothing concrete 
will come out of it. The paper says the three were speaking 
under the aegis of the newly formed National Democratic 
Coalition, NADECO. 
  THE PUNCH and THE GUARDIAN say the National Democratic 
Coalition, NADECO, has urged Nigerians to boycott the proposed 
constitutional conference. The papers say NADECO, a pressure 
group in nature, has also urged the present military government 
in Nigeria to shelve the planned conference. According to the 
papers, NADECO has described the conference as a ruse and [word 
indistinct] intended to perpetuate military dictatorship in 
Nigeria. 
  VANGUARD and CONCORD report that the group has given the 
military regime in Nigeria an ultimatum to make way for Chief 
M.K.O. Abiola who allegedly won the June 1993 annulled 
presidential election. The papers say NADECO has given the 
military up to 31 May to call on Chief Abiola to form a 
broad-based government. 
  Military Blamed For Crisis: THE REPUBLIC. The paper reports 
that a pressure group known as the Campaign for Democracy [CD] 
has blamed what it calls the current crisis of confidence in 
Nigeria on the military class. REPUBLIC quotes a communique 
issued by the Kogi State wing of the CD as saying that for 
Nigeria to successfully move out from such crisis of confidence, 
it will require genuine political education of its citizenry.

  [Text] Lagos, 16 May (AFP) -- A Campaign for Democracy [CD] 
official told AFP today that the organization has prepared a 
three-day program to commemorate the first anniversary of the 
June 12 presidential election that was annulled by the former 
military regime. The CD is made up of about 40 pro-democratic 
and human rights movements. 
  The 12 June election, which Yoruba billionaire Moshood 
Abiola 
claims to have won, was annulled by General Ibrahim Babangida's 
regime on the grounds that there were irregularities. 
  The organization's secretary general, Sylvester 
Odion-Akhaine, said the CD is calling on Nigerians to wear black 
badges during the three days of commemoration as a sign of 
mourning in memory of those who died last year "in the name of 
democracy." The commemoration period will also be used to 
protest the return of the military to power following the 
cancellation of the election. Last year the CD said it favored 
the installation of Moshood Abiola as president. 
  Mr. Akhaine further said his organization supported the aims 
and aspirations of the National Democratic Coalition [NADECO], a 
new pro-democratic organization which was established in Lagos 
on 13 May. NADECO has given General Sani Abacha up until 31 May 
to hand over the task of forming a broad-based government to 
Moshood Abiola.

  [Text] The Kaduna State government has set up a new task 
force on fuel supply headed by the state military administrator, 
Colonel Lawal Ja'afaru Isa. The task force was inaugurated 
today at the end of a joint meeting between the administrator, 
NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation] officials, and 
oil dealers and marketers in Kaduna. Members of the task force 
include all state commissioners, directors general, NNPC 
officials, and representatives of oil dealers and marketers. 
  Under the new guidelines, no loaded tanker would leave the 
NNPC depot without the presence of the administrator. In 
addition, a loaded tanker must be accompanied by a commissioner 
or a director general from the depot to the discharging points. 
All escorting officers are duty bound to inspect all the 
compartments of a tanker to ensure that all its contents were 
off-loaded at the destinations. 
  Col. Isa directed all filling stations to henceforth 
commence 
operations from 7 o'clock each morning and close down at 7 
o'clock in the night. They are also required to sell only 100 
naira worth of petrol to each vehicle at a time. He warned that 
the offending dealers would have their licenses seized, while 
their filling stations would be converted to government filling 
stations.

  [Text] Lagos, 17 May (PANA) -- The archbishop of the Church 
of Nigeria, Reverend Abiodun Adetiloye, has called on the 
country's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, to relinquish power 
without delay. 
  In an open letter dated 11 May, released to the media in 
Lagos late Monday [16 May], the Anglican cleric urged the 
Nigerian leader to reverse immediately the annulment of 
country's 12 June 1993 election results and install a 
democratically elected government. "Now is the time for you to 
bow out honourably" he said. "If you cannot see the handwriting 
on the wall and bow out, the end may be inglorious." Rev. 
Adetiloye told Abacha that refusal to [word indistinct] would 
throw Nigeria into "a disastrous revolution" that could divide 
the country. 
  In an apparent reference to former military ruler, Gen. 
Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down from after annulling the 
elections in which millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola 
claimed victory, the archbishop said: "De-annul the annulment, 
install the democratically elected president and [word 
indistinct] honour as a hero of the decade, otherwise your exit 
would be equally inglorious." 
  The archbishop expressed surprise that the Nigerian leader 
had gone to South Africa to witness the inauguration of 
President Nelson Mandela after his (Abacha's) "active 
participation in the annulment of a free, fair and peaceful 
election" of Nigeria's own president. 
  The archbishop's letter comes in the wake of growing 
pressure 
from various organisations, groups and individuals on the 
Nigerian leader to step down. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] The number of newspapers now registered in Sierra 
Leone under the new press guidelines has risen to 11. These 
include two newspapers that will be in circulation for the first 
time -- [newspaper names indistinct]. So far, out of the number 
of newspapers that operated under the 1993 press guidelines, 
only two have so far not been fully registered -- THE NATION and 
GLOBE newspapers. According to the public relations division of 
the government information services, there are all indications 
that more newspapers will be in circulation this year, 
particularly so (?since) the 1993 deadline for registration and 
reregistration has been abolished.

  [Excerpt] The Chadian Government and the Federation of 
Chadian Trade Unions [UST] are to meet again this afternoon. 
According to our correspondent Rene Bila Yombiri, their main 
concern will be the suspension of the general strike. 
  [Begin Yombiri recording] The social pact, which is the 
cause 
of the general strike, has still not been signed, with the main 
bone of contention being the preconditions. The UST, which 
launched the strike, has demanded the pullout of ghost labor 
unions from the negotiations, the withdrawal of security forces 
from the Labor Exchange -- headquarters of the country's two 
labor federations -- and, especially, the abrogation of a decree 
controlling strikes in Chad, which was enacted at a cabinet 
meeting in view of the current strike. The government has 
refused to abrogate the decree so the UST has called for its 
suspension pending the establishment of the administrative 
court, which alone is entitled to abrogate or maintain the 
decree. If the decree is suspended, the UST promises to suspend 
the general strike for two weeks in order to examine and sign 
the social pact. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Brazzaville, 16 May (AFP) -- Congo is ready to put 
more than 100 soldiers at the disposal of the United Nations for 
the formation of a new international peacekeeping force in 
Rwanda, a senior official of the Congolese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs in Brazzaville stated today. "It will be a company of 
120 to 125 soldiers, all volunteers, who will be put at the 
disposal of the organization to be part of the peacekeeping 
force in Rwanda," said this senior official who preferred not to 
be named. The Congolese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a 
request from the organization and the request is expected to be 
given a "favorable response," he stated. 
  Last week, UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
proposed 
to increase to 5,500 the number of blue helmets in Rwanda for an 
essentially humanitarian mission. The strength of the UN 
Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] was reduced from 2,500 to 
400 men when the massacres began in that country following the 
death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents on 6 April. 
Twenty-five Congolese were in the UNAMIR.

  [Text] Libreville, 16 May (AFP) -- The Union for Democracy 
and Social Development of Equatorial Guinea [UDDS], a 
Libreville-based opposition party which is not recognized by the 
government, has urged the Equatorial Guinean Government to hold 
roundtable talks with all the opposition parties before new 
elections are held. 
  In a communique sent to AFP in Libreville today, the UDDS 
stressed that issues to be discussed at the talks should include 
the formulation of laws on the press, unions, associations, the 
establishment of a human rights charter, as well as the access 
of all parties to state media. 
  The UDDS says it is "ready to negotiate directly and 
unconditionally" with President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo or 
his representatives "in order to end the country's 
sociopolitical crisis." 
  Municipal elections are scheduled to be held by the end of 
the year. To this end, a delegation led by a senior civil 
servant in charge of elections at the Spanish Interior Ministry, 
Miguel Angel Abat, recently visited Malabo to assist the 
authorities with electoral code reforms and electoral census, 
reliable sources in Libreville have disclosed.

  [Excerpt] Electricity rates will increase by an average of 
19 percent within the next few days while water rates will 
increase by an average of 15 percent. These increases were 
announced by the government on 14 May. For electricity, 45 
percent of regular consumers, notably 194,000 households, will 
be spared the rate increases. For water, 100,000 consumers will 
be exempted. 
  The increases in electricity and water rates are due to the 
excess operational costs resulting from the devaluation. 
However, the necessary rate increase was calculated as strictly 
as possible in order not to penalize the people and to preserve 
the competitiveness of the country's businesses and 
professionals. 
  In both cases, the state will bear the greater share of the 
cost. For water, the real increase in the average rate is about 
40 percent, and for electricity, the rate is 30 percent.

  [Text] Abidjan, 16 May (AFP) -- The call for a one-week 
strike made on 11 May by the Federation of University and High 
School Students [FESCI] was observed only by some students today 
at the Abidjan campus where most lectures were given but were 
poorly attended. FESCI also announced to the media that five of 
its leaders, including deputy general secretary Ble Guirao, were 
picked up for interrogation yesterday. 
  Some 200 people picked up for interrogation on 11 May during 
and after a demonstration dispersed by the police on the 
university campus were released, according to an official source. 
  Yesterday evening, in a radio and television message, Semi 
Bi 
Zan, the rector of the university, called on the students "to go 
back to class" to avoid "irreversibly jeopardizing their 
university education." He stressed that the strike threatened 
"the validity of the current academic year" which belatedly 
began in February and is supposed to end in mid-August. 
  The rector called on the students "to foil the attempt of 
the 
minority who want to paralyze the university" and assured them 
that their "protection" would be guaranteed. This morning 
several hundred policemen in uniform or plain clothes were on 
the Abidjan campus.

effective method that would guarantee an efficient supply and 
distribution. The government is also making efforts to 
eliminate artificial scarcity of the product caused by diversion

  [Excerpts] UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] has 
protested at shots fired by the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] at 
former French minister for humanitarian affairs Bernard Kouchner 
and the convoy bringing him back from a meeting with officials 
from the other side. [passage omitted] 
  Bernard Kouchner is in Kigali. That is where Christophe 
Boisbouvier contacted him: 
  [Begin recording] [Kouchner] There are refugees everywhere: 
Some are hidden, some are out in the open, and they are in a 
very difficult and dangerous position. There are 2 million 
refugees in the country, between 1 and 2 million, and there are 
some who are in particular danger in Kigali. 
  Do I have any hope? If I didn't have any hope I wouldn't be 
going on, but nothing has yet been achieved. Let me remind you 
that, in cooperation with the United Nations, with the UN forces 
led by General Dallaire, we want to open the humanitarian 
corridors that they themselves tried to open long ago, and to 
protect those in danger, especially inside the town. 
  [Boisbouvier] Do you hope to be able to get the refugees out 
of the town to the airport, in particular the ones in the Hotel 
des Mille Collines, the Amahoro stadium, and the church of the 
Holy Family? 
  [Kouchner] We hope to start a symbolic evacuation that will 
make it possible to open up these corridors and to continue 
their protectection by the UN forces. [end recording]

  [Text] A convoy of government Army vehicles and of some 
cars belonging to UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] from 
Gitarama which was heading for Kigali, recently found itself 
within shooting range of the Rwanda Patriotic Army [RPA]. 
However, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] would like to state 
the following: Since a section of the Kigali-Gitarama road fell 
under the control of the RPA, the latter swiftly informed UNAMIR 
about it. Second, the convoy that was scared off by shots fired 
by the RPA included vehicles belonging to the Rwanda Government 
Army and to UNAMIR. Let us also recall that the same government 
Army has confiscated several UNAMIR cars, using them at its own 
discretion. This is witnessed by the fact that the blue berets' 
vehicles were recovered [words indistinct] in the hands of the 
RPA. In addition, UNAMIR has in fact reported the confiscation 
of vehicles by the government (?Army) to the RPF. [passage

<F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 16 (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels sealed 
the road from the embattled capital Kigali to Gitarama, where 
the government fled last month as ethnic carnage engulfed the 
country, a UN official said Monday [16 May]. 
  The army denied that their foes had seized control of a 
stretch of the road from Kigali to Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 
miles) to the southwest. But Abdul Kabia, executive director of 
the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, said the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) had cut the road as they tightened their 
grip on Kigali, which they have sealed off on three sides. 
Kabia said government forces now controlled only the western 
part of Kigali and the rebels were trying to sever their supply 
lines. 
  The RPF, dominated by the minority Tutsi tribe that has 
borne 
the brunt of six weeks of bloodletting in which 200,000 people 
have been butchered, claimed responsibility Monday for shooting 
at an army-escorted convoy carrying former French humanitarian 
minister Bernard Kouchner on a mercy mission. [passage omitted 
covered in referent items] 
  Kouchner left Rwanda on Monday after spending five days 
trying to persuade both sides to allow civilians trapped in the 
capital and still being massacred by death squads to leave via 
"humanitarian safe corridors" which he wants the army and rebels 
to keep free from fighting. 
  Kouchner was still trying to secure an agreement to begin 
evacuating civilians Monday, but UN sources said his mission 
could still produce results. 
  Sporadic firefights broke out in different areas of Kigali 
on 
Monday as rain lashed the surrounding hills, once green with 
banana trees but now brown and barren, stripped by hungry 
displaced people. It was a relatively quiet day after 10 days of 
fierce artillery duels, said UN spokesman Moctar Gueye, who was 
slightly hurt when bullet fragments struck his face during the 
attack on Kouchner's convoy. "Everyone's waiting," Gueye said. 
  The UN has protested to the rebels over the shooting, and 
has 
also complained to the army over its failure "to ensure the 
security" of Kouchner. 
  The UN Security Council is preparing to approve 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for the UN force in 
Rwanda to be increased to 5,500, according to reports from New 
York. [passage omitted] 
  French officials said several African countries including 
Tanzania, Ghana and Nigeria were willing to contribute troops to 
a strengthened UN force. 
  Eleven UN peacekeepers have been killed in the past six 
weeks 
in Rwanda, 10 of them Belgian soldiers allegedly murdered by the 
presidential guard. 
  Most of the 200,000 Rwandans butchered with machetes or 
clubbed to death with wooden stakes were Tutsis or opposition 
supporters from the majority Hutu tribe.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Davie] </F>
  [Text] Labour Minister Tito Mboweni says his department is 
not an extension of the trade-union movement. He has begun a 
two-week series of meetings with unions, forums and business to 
acquaint himself with the most pressing labour issues. He then 
intends briefing the Cabinet on the programme of action for this 
year. 
  Ad-hoc planning must be avoided, he says. "We must try to 
prevent a situation of firefighting." 
  Mr. Mboweni, sworn in on Wednesday, had met COSATU [Congress 
of South African Trade Unions] leaders before an interview with 
BUSINESS TIMES on Thursday. A meeting with outgoing Manpower 
Director-General Joel Fourie was planned for Friday. 
  "I expect he'll show me to my office, where the telephone 
is, 
where to make tea ...," says Mr. Mbowenni, asking that he be 
called Tito, not minister. 
  He says personnel of the Department of Manpower, which has 
been renamed the Department of Labour, are not representative of 
SA [South African] society. A programme of training, 
re-training and affirmative action will begin. 
  Mr. Mboweni was due to meet David Brink of Business SA and 
Anglo American's Bobby Godsell, as well as representatives of 
the National Economic Forum, the Chamber of Mines, Seifsa [Steel 
and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa], NUM 
[National Union of Mineworkers] and Fedsal [Federation of 
Salaried Staff Associations]. 
  The ANC has identified a four-point mission statement to 
guide its approach to the labour market. Economic and human 
development and social justice will be promoted through support 
for collective bargaining, development of fair labour standards 
and practices, human resource development and the facilitation 
of tripartite relations among social partners at national 
industrial levels. 
  Mr. Mboweni says labour-based public works projects, as 
outlined in the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) 
may be housed in the Department of Labour. 
  One of six cabinet ministers in their 30s, Mr. Mboweni sees 
a 
period ahead of acclimatisation in which Cabinet procedures, 
rules and protocols will be learned. He was told he had been 
chosen for the labour job after the ANC's national working 
committee meeting last Wednesday. 
  Ministries will have to help implement the RDP. Mr. 
Mboweni's job will be to ensure jobs are created, that a 
descent, living wage is paid and that workers have safe 
conditions. 
  The Department of Labour intends developing existing forums 
and wants more professional and efficient delivery of services, 
such as skills training. Mr. Mboweni says policy will be less 
about spending more money and more about using more efficient 
systems. 
  Another challenge is to extend basic rights of workers to 
farm labourers. 
  Leslie Maasdorp, who has been co-ordinating labour market 
policy for the ANC, sat in on the interview. He says close to 
6-million people are outside the formal system. Formal 
representation of the unemployed in the process is difficult, 
but the ANC wants it to be as broad as possible. 
  Mr.Maasdorp says past economic policies distorted the labour 
market. Freeing the market will not in itself redress the 
situation. "But we're not arguing for extensive regulation." 
  Government's role will be to protect the vulnerable while 
supporting negotiated settlements. 
  Mr. Mboweni says "job creation must be seen in the context 
of 
a stable and growing economy. Sustainability in very important."

<F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia, Stephen Laufer, Chris Louw and Paul </F>
Stober] 
  [Text] Unmistakably bearing Nelson Mandela's personal 
stamp, the national unity cabinet announced this week emerged 
after days of juggling during which the president was forced to 
keep his eye on a number of balls tossed to him by the coalition 
parties. 
  Perhaps most influential among the juggler's assistants was 
Mandela's own organisation, with the ANC's highest body, the 
National Working Committee [NWC], insisting on retaining control 
over several key portfolios despite massive pressure from the 
National Party and Inkatha for him to relinquish them. 
  Among the cabinet positions the ANC was determined to hang 
on 
to were those related to security, including the defence, 
police, and justice ministries, and land, key to the party's 
reconstruction development programme. 
  ANC members have also been named as deputies in key 
ministries the party relinquished to their coalition partners. 
Said one cabinet insider: "We have a watchman in any ministry 
with relevance to the future." "Watchmen" include trade union 
heavyweight Alec Erwin as deputy finance minister to the Nat's 
[National Party, NP] Derek Keys, ANC legal advisor Penuell 
Maduna as deputy to Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
Valli Moosa at Provincial Affairs under Roelf Meyer, which will 
be key in the development of the federal system, and Thoko Msane 
at Agriculture, which is headed by the Nat's Kraai van Niekerk. 
  The ANC can expect to install a second level of "watchmen" 
when the directors general are appointed. These could include 
Cheryl Carolus at welfare, and John Samuel at education. 
Lawyer Nicholas "Fink" Haysom was reportedly offered the top 
South African Police position, but turned it down in favour of a 
counsellor's post in the President's office. 
  The appointments of Winnie Mandela and Bantu Holomisa as 
deputies in the education and environment ministries 
respectively relates directly to their standing in the ANC. 
Mandela appears to have found it impossible to ignore their 
popular followings. Buthelezi's appointment to the Home Affairs 
ministry -- formerly Interior -- was criticised by Inkatha 
spokesman Ziba Jiyane as "the only substantial ministry we got". 
He said Buthelezi "was very hesitant right up to the last 
moment", but had told colleagues they could take cabinet 
positions if they wanted to. 
  Buthelezi had argued in Inkatha for an opposition role, 
saying the ANC would use the cabinet as a "rubber stamp" for its 
own policies, "messing up the country" and then holding everyone 
responsible. But the opposite view that it was "important to 
have a foothold in decision making on things that affect people 
on the ground" prevailed, said Jiyane. 
  Although the Home Affairs Ministry is regarded as a very 
senior portfolio and Buthelezi's appointment is a clear sign 
that Mandela intends to continue with his policy of national 
reconciliation, ANC insiders insisted the Inkatha chief would 
not be allowed to run future elections. Although this function 
has traditionally resided within the Interior Ministry, several 
senior sources said a permanent independent electoral commission 
would be established. 
  The NP argued strongly for the defence, correctional 
services, justice, and police portfolios, saying the appointment 
of one or more senior Nats who enjoyed the trust of the security 
forces would smooth the transition. But the ANC's top committee 
was unwilling to relinquish the ministries, arguing that the 
NP's human rights record made it impossible to give them the 
justice portfolio. 
  Similarly, reservations surfaced on the Nats' willingness to 
root out the "third force" inside the security forces. "They 
want the security forces to know right away who is boss," said 
one Nat source. 
  Added to the equation was the ANC's intention of leaving 
General Johan van der Merwe in charge of the police and General 
George Meiring at the head of the military for the time being. 
They are seen as powerful leadership figures, particularly for 
white members of the security forces who need to be led gently 
to integration and transformation. 
  Balance required ANC people to head these ministries as long 
as the old guard stayed in uniform, argued the NWC. 
  While Sydney Mufamadi's appointment to head the law and 
order 
ministry -- renamed "safety and security" -- was almost 
universally welcomed within the SAP [South African Police] and 
the ANC, former MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- spear of the nation, 
ANC military wing] commander Joe Modise's nomination to the 
defence portfolio was more controversial. 
  Senior SANDF [South African National Defense Force] officers 
made their preference for Modise clear, but ANC members have 
criticised his endorsement of the generals' demands for an end 
to defence cuts. He has also not fully lived down criticism of 
his failure to prevent human rights abuses in MK camps in Angola 
in the 1980s. 
  But Modise enjoys the loyalty of the MK hierarchy, many of 
whom can expect to take senior uniformed and defence ministry 
positions in the near future. 
  His conduct of the integration negotiations and TEC 
[Transitional Executive Council] defence subcouncil have been 
positively received. 
  The appointment of Inkatha's Joe Matthews as deputy minister 
of safety and security is both a concession to Buthelezi and a 
calculated strategy by Mandela, who is keen to show the kwaZulu 
Police that their long-term interests are best served by 
integration into South Africa's future security establishment. 
A former ANC member, Matthews is seen as intelligent and 
flexible, and ANC security experts believe it will be possible 
to establish a good working relationship with him. 
  The ANC's insistence on retaining the main security 
portfolios -- correctional services ultimately went to Inkatha's 
Sipho Mzimela -- cost constitutional affairs expert Kader Asmal 
a key position as provincial affairs minister. The portfolio, 
vital to shaping the federal relationship between central and 
regional government, went to the NP's Roelf Meyer in return for 
Nat acquiescence on the security ministries. 
  The land portfolio was almost lost to the ANC when the NP 
insisted on heading the agriculture ministry, which has 
traditionally included land matters. 
  Mandela was reportedly preparing to withdraw his nomination 
of Derek Hanekom last Friday when the NWC stepped in. Saying 
the ANC was the only party with a coherent policy on land, and 
pointing to its central importance for the party's 
reconstruction and development programme, several NWC members 
insisted on splitting land and agriculture. 
  Hanekom's nomination to the portfolio was also contentious, 
with some arguing that a ministry responsible for the emotive 
issues of resettlement, land redistribution and compensation 
should go to a black. Former ANC Women's League general 
secretary Baleka Kgositsile as mentioned as a possible minister. 
  Although regarded as a political heavyweight, Kgositsile was 
felt to lack experience in land issues. Hanekom, whose 
expertise and struggle credentials are unquestioned, was 
championed by several NWC members. "Competence won out over 
political correctness," said one participant. 
  Inkatha is understood to have had its eye on at least one 
senior security position as well as health and housing. The two 
departments are key to improving basic living conditions, and 
represent areas in which there is potentially much political hay 
to be made in the runup to the 1999 election. 
  Recognising their importance, Mandela stuck to his original 
choices of Joe Slovo for housing and Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma 
for Health.

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] From banned organization to one of the biggest 
political parties in Parliament. The South African Communist 
Party [SACP] reached the end of the road when between 40-50 of 
its members were sworn in as MP's. In addition to this, three 
communists were appointed to cabinet with two former members 
also represented in government structures. The SACP is now one 
of the strongest parties in Parliament with only the ANC, with 
between 191-201 MP's, and the NP [National Party] with 82 MP's, 
better represented. 
<H5>  Poor Threat </H5>
  However, the SACP has delivered a poorer performance than 
expected with its three cabinet members and only one out of 12 
deputy ministers. The communists in the cabinet are Mr. Joe 
Slovo, minister of housing, Sydney Mufamadi, minister of safety 
and security, and Jeff Radebe, minister of public works. Among 
the deputy ministers is Mr. Alec Erwin, the deputy finance 
minister, a card-carrying member of the SACP. 
<H5>  Effectiveness </H5>
  This information was confirmed this week by an SACP 
spokesman, Mr. Jeremy Cronin, but Mr. Cronin says that the SACP 
does not look at "red hats" in parliament and in cabinet, but 
rather at the effectiveness of the appointments. Overlapping 
alliances are a noteworthy characteristic of the 252 MP's of the 
ANC alliance who took their places this week as parliamentarians 
of South Africa's new majority party. Although all of them 
swear allegiance to the ANC, some communists and others are 
members of both COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] 
and the SACP. Mr. Erwin is one of these -- officially a COSATU 
candidate but also a member of the SACP. The SACP, unlike 
COSATU, did not have a separate list of candidates where it is 
clearly stated that a specific parliamentarian belongs to the 
party. According to Mr. Cronin, by this weekend the SACP head 
office did not yet have a complete list of SACP members elected 
to Parliament. The SACP, however, is prepared to make such a 
list, of communists represented in Parliament, available at a 
later stage. 
<H5>  Jay Naidoo </H5>
  It is significant that COSATU, with its reported 1.3 million 
members and representative of 14 trade unions, performed poorer 
that the SACP, concerning the election of members to Parliament 
as well as with appointments to the cabinet. The SACP 
apparently only has 60,000 registered members. Against the 
SACP's 40-50 parliamentarians, COSATU could only get 21 of its 
members into Parliament, and its former Secretary General, Mr. 
Jay Naidoo, the only cabinet minister. Mr. Naidoo, minister 
without portfolio, was appointed to oversee the ANC's 
Reconstruction and Development Program. Other known COSATU 
members elected to Parliament are: Mr. Phillip Dexter 
(apparently also a communist) of the trade union for health 
workers, National Education Health and Allied Workers Union; 
Moses Mayekiso of the South African National Civics Organization 
(SANCO), also a member of the SACP; and Randall van den Heever, 
teachers' union leader. Although only three communists are 
serving on the cabinet, the minister of transport, Mr. Mac 
Maharaj, is a former member. One of the executive deputy 
presidents, Mr. Thabo Mbeki, was a member of the SACP but 
resigned from the party a long time ago. Opponents of the SACP 
have alleged that this was for "strategic reasons." 
<H5>  ZUMA's </H5>
  Another cabinet member with communist links is Mrs. 
Nkosazana 
Dlamini Zuma, minister of health. Her husband, Mr. Jacob Zuma, 
leader of the ANC in Natal and member of the Natal Executive 
Council, is also apparently a member of the SACP. The minister 
of water and forestry, Prof. Kader Asmal, was involved with 
Marxist groups in Cape Town for a long time, but according to 
experts this does not mean that he is a member of the SACP.

<F P=106> [By Chris Louw] </F>
  [Text] Serious concern has surfaced in the National Party 
[NP, Nats] about the ANC's commitment to consensus 
decision-making in the new cabinet of national unity, following 
the announcement of the final cabinet by President Nelson 
Mandela. 
  NP sources claimed Mandela had reneged on two undertakings: 
that he would announce the new cabinet only after consulting 
Deputy President F.W. de Klerk, and that he would share the four 
security portfolios of defence, safety and security (formerly 
law and order), justice and correctional services between the NP 
and the ANC. 
  The NP also fears that real power will not reside with the 
cabinet, but that important policy decisions will be taken by 
the ANC's National Executive Committee [NEC], with cabinet 
serving as a mere rubber stamp. 
  ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa's decision not to join 
the cabinet was described as "a worrying development". Senior 
Nats consider Ramaphosa highly ambitious and likely to assert 
his influence from outside the executive, leading to a shift in 
the balance of power between the NEC and the cabinet and the 
isolation of NP cabinet members. 
  Ramaphosa is known to have made enemies, some within his own 
party, since the Transitional Executive Council began operating 
last year. Opponents say the wide powers he wielded during the 
transition have gone to his head, and that he has become "aloof 
and arrogant". 
  Said one senior NP source: "We cannot conceivably be 
satisfied with serving as a rubber stamp for decisions taken by 
the ANC's NEC. The next few weeks will show whether everyone in 
the ANC's top echelons understands the notion of consensus 
government and nation-building." 
  The sources said Mandela's "premature announcement" last 
Friday of the ANC's list of cabinet proposals contradicted 
agreements with the NP leadership. Discussions with De Klerk 
had not been finalised when the names were made public, they 
said. 
  Rumour had it this week that the early announcement of the 
ANC's cabinet list -- before negotiations between De Klerk and 
Mandela were completed -- was the result of pressure from senior 
NEC members. 
  One NP parliamentarian speculated that members of a "cabal" 
in the NEC had dismissed NP claims that a mutiny might follow 
the failure to appoint an NP person as minister in a key 
security portfolio. "They want the security forces to know 
right away who's the boss" he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Z.B. du Toit] </F>
  [Text] A real effort is underway to bring about 
reconciliation between General Constand Viljoen and Dr. Ferdi 
Hartzenberg's Afrikaner National Front. A joint committee of 
the two organizations could, within a few days, repport back on 
whether a basis could be found on which supporters of the 
volkstaat [homeland] idea can work together outside and inside 
Parliament. 
  The division in right-wing ranks started when Gen. Viljoen 
and a group of supporters broke away from the National Front 
shortly before the elections and participated in the election 
under the banner of the newly-formed Freedom Front. They are 
now claiming that the Freedom Front mustered the most right-wing 
votes -- a claim which is being strongly rejected by the 
National Front. 
<H5>  Reconciliation </H5>
  While there is strong insistence on reconciliation from 
certain quarters, Gen. Viljoen sounded a warning this week: "We 
knew from the outset that we had chosen the right strategic path 
by participating in the election. We had to endure many insults 
as a result of this choice. The Freedom Front cannot at this 
stage let its supporters down and this does not mean that we are 
reluctant to cooperate. But the Freedom Front will not subject 
itself to the authority of the National Front." 
  According to Dr. Hrtzenberg, the initiative is being taken 
to 
unite as many Afrikaners as possible, not only the right wing, 
but even supporters of the NP National Party are also being 
targeted. He believes that the joint objective of a "free, 
Christian, Afrikaner republic" presents sufficient basis from 
which work on unity can be extended. All right wingers must be 
included in this union, Dr. Hartzenberg believes. 
<H5>  New Grouping </H5>
  But according to Gen. Viljoen, he cannot say at this 
juncture 
that he is optimistic. "In the election the Freedom Front got 
together a brand new grouping of Afrikaners; not only right 
wingers, but many from the NP as well. The needs of all have to 
be taken into consideration now." 
  According to his estimate the Freedom Front received 35 
percent support from adult Afrikaners with more than 30 percent 
among those that abstained. This represents a majority of all 
Afrikaners, Gen. Viljoen said. -- In some circles within the 
National Front this week there had been little enthusiasm 
regarding cooperation with Gen. Viljoen. "There is no basis for 
unity because the Freedom Front's policy differs drastically 
from that of the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]," says AWB 
Executive Committee member Fred Rundle. "The Freedom Front is 
nearer to the ANC than it is to us," he said.

  [Text] Oman has placed an order for up to 24 long-range G6 
155mm self-propelled artillery systems from Denel, JANE'S 
DEFENCE WEEKLY reported. The order was part of a larger 
programme to upgrade the Omani armed forces. 
  Oman became the second Middle East country to select the G6. 
Abu Dhabi ordered 78 in 1990. 
  The G6 can fire an extended range full-bore projectile to a 
range of 39km. A 155mm, 52 calibre version was being developed 
with a range of more than 40km. The G6 is based on the 
self-propelled G5. 
  Meanwhile, Denel subsidiary Kentron, which manufactures 
missiles, would soon begin carriage tests of an enhanced variant 
of the Darter infrared guided air-to-air missile, the U-Darter, 
on the Northrop F-5 light-weight fighter aircraft.

However, church commissioners said in London that the decision 
was unlikely to mean an immediate movement of substantial sums 
into South African companies. They said that proper research 
and monitoring would continue to ensure that potential 
investment conformed with ethical guidelines. 
  Observers at the conference said South Africa would gain 
from 
acting as a conduit to the rest of Africa with better transport 
links, while its skilled technicians and engineers would be 
cheaper than their counterparts from Europe and the United

  [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- Western Areas gold mine 
management reached an agreement with two warring factions on its 
mine on Friday, ending fighting which led to the killing of six 
miners since last weekend. Mine owners Johannesburg Consolidated 
Investment [JCI] Gold Division Chairman Kennedy Maxwell said the 
parties agreed to a code of conduct, security arrangements and a 
high-level committee to investigate the causes of conflict. 
  In terms of the agreement mine security personnel and 
National Peace Secretariat monitors would be deployed 
underground where four miners were killed on Wednesday. 
  Western areas consulting engineer John Brownriggs said 
miners 
had agreed to resume work on Saturday. 
  Search teams comprising mine security, the South African 
National Defence Force, the Internal Stability Unit and the 
National Peace Secretariat had confisticated eight tons of 
home-made weapons during hostel searches in the past week. 
  Mr Brownriggs said initial indications were that the faction 
fighting was a sequel to the killing of two Zulu miners 
returning from an Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] rally on April 17. 
Subsequent to the arrest of a Xhosa suspect on May 4, renewed 
tension arose in the mine when a group went to the mine 
management demanding the release of their arrested colleague, he 
added. 
  JCI was assessing production losses resulting from the work 
stoppages during the conflict and would make an announcement 
next week, Mr Maxwell said. 
  Production had continued throughout the period as white 
miners had continued working. 
  National Union of Mineworkers [NUM] Assistant General 
Secretary Gwede Mantashe said the code of conduct agreed to with 
JCI provided for the control of access to mine hostels, 
possession of weapons as a dismissable offence and control of 
visits by non-hostel dwellers. Mr Mantashe blamed the conflict 
on the housing of workers on ethnic lines and the promotion of 
IFP-aligned elements to undermine the NUM. 
  Mr Maxwell conceded that historically workers had been 
housed 
according to ethnic affiliations, but JCI had started 
negotiations a year ago to abolish ethnic housing. 
  JCI Gold Division human resources manager Craig Lawrence 
said 
the transformation from compulsory segregation to integration 
was a sensitive and difficult problem, with no consensus among 
all those involved.

  [Text] A strong political party outside Parliament is 
capable of achieving more than a weak one inside Parliament. 
This is the opinion of Conservative Party [CP] and Afrikaner 
National Front leader Ferdi Hartzenberg. 
  Dr. Hartzenberg said in Pretoria that the role of the CP had 
not come to an end. In fact, the real struggle for 
self-determination has only just begun and the CP will have to 
take the lead in this struggle. Today the Afrikaners are 
standing where they stood on 31 May 1902, when they were also 
not represented in Parliament. Within eight years they had 
attained self-government as a result of work accomplished by 
parties outside Parliament. 
  A party inside Parliament has only a certain power base, 
which in some cases can be restrictive. A party's support is 
measured by the number of votes during the last election. Its 
power base can therefore not really be expanded since it is 
pinned down to the representation which it has inside 
Parliament. An extra-Parliamentary party, on the contrary, is 
not subject to this limitation. 
  Dr. Hartzenberg added that once again the CP will strive for 
Afrikaner unity and that it would resume contact with nations 
that are striving for self-determination. 
  What is important, however, is that the structures of the 
CP, 
in view of its new, challenging role, should be brought to 
preparedness within the shortest possible time. A campaign of 
reorganization will be initiated, while the CP's Executive 
Committee will have to discuss certain technical modifications. 
  In this context, Dr. Hartzenberg made a very serious appeal 
to all CP members to throw in their support to make the party 
structure more streamlined and effective than ever before.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Peace and reconciliation in Kwazulu/Natal"] </F>
  [Text] Today, in KwaZulu/Natal is the big day when the 
parliament of the KwaZulu/Natal region is inaugurated. This 
parliament has representation from those parties that achieved 
success in the recent election. 
  It is a parliament of the people of this region, elected by 
them; therefore we do not doubt that the people will give it due 
respect and cooperation in its operation. 
  We congratulate all the parties that achieved success in 
this 
election and we desire that they work together toward 
development in KwaZulu/Natal. Special congratulations to the 
new prime minister of the region, the honorable Dr. Mdlalose, 
who has been given the great responsibility of leading at a time 
of healing of the wounds and hurts of the people of 
KwaZulu/Natal. 
  We do not doubt that he will be able to work together with 
Mr. Jacob Zuma of the ANC in making peace between the followers 
of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC, who have been at 
loggerheads for many years in this region. We request that 
other ANC leaders in the region, such as Mr. Harry Gwala, 
support Mr. Zuma in this task. 
  The time for war is now past. This is a time of 
reconciliation and reconstruction. This is the time to gird up 
for the hard work at hand of repairing the damage inflicted by 
apartheid in this country, especially on the black community. 
In KwaZulu/Natal we have the wonderful opportunity of also 
working together to rebuild what was broken down by the anarchy 
and violence that compromised much that was good in the region. 
  This region has a great many people, but also has much 
poverty and underdevelopment. Job opportunities must be 
created, houses must be built, schools must be built and 
teachers trained, hospitals and clinics must be built, roads 
constructed, and food and other commodities produced. All this 
cannot be achieved without peace and reconciliation in this 
region. We therefore urge everyone to work for peace and 
reconciliation if our freedom is to bear tangible results.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The exiled Black 
Consciousness Movement of Azanian [BCMA] will return to South 
Africa to merge with its internal but separate sister 
counterpart, the Azanian People's Organisation [AZAPO]. 
Publicity and Information Secretary Vuyisa Qunta said in a 
telephone interview from the BCMA's headquarters in Harare on 
Friday his organisation would return at the earliest possible 
date. 
  The future of the BCMA's armed wing, the Azanian National 
Liberation Army, would be addressed after returning to South 
Africa. 
  "We are coming back home to strenthen AZAPO in its fight 
against deprivation of the black people, to strengthen it in its 
fight against the landlessness of the black people, their 
non-participation in the economic life of the country and their 
generally poor social conditions." 
  AZAPO boycotted the April elections saying they would only 
justify the inequalities created by apartheid. 
  Asked to comment on the 20 per cent showing by the National 
Party, Mr Qunta said it showed the critical role that needed to 
be played by AZAPO in urging blacks to be self-reliant and not 
regard the white man as the "baas" of the old days. "The minds 
of our people are in bad shape and a lot of work...still needs 
to be done. 
  "It is often said that the strongest weapon that the 
oppressor has is the mind of the oppressed, and this was clearly 
reflected in the recent elections where the oppressor got a 
substantial number of votes from the oppressed community 
itself," Mr Qunta said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] If the recent failed attempt at elections is 
accepted, the Conservative Party [CP] wants to make it very 
clear that it regards the new government as the illegal product 
of an invalid election. It is unthinkable that in a civilized 
country a government should be elected fraudulently and 
thereafter expect recognition and to be treated with respect. 
  This is how the president of the People's Representative 
Council and CP leader, Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg, reacted even 
before the ballot boxes had been locked and large-scale election 
fraud and irregularities had been exposed. 
  Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg had at that stage already been 
insisting that the election be declared null and void, "as a 
result of the more than desired number of atrocious 
irregularities; because of the fact that the Independent 
Electoral Commission proved to be totally inefficient in doing 
the job; and that most of the parties have expressed their 
dissatisfaction. In such circumstances an election cannot be 
labelled free and fair, especially if measured by Western 
standards as has always been the case thus far in South Africa. 
Hence the intended and anticipated peace will also not 
materialize." 
  According to Dr. Hartzenberg, this process has only been 
intended to put a communist ANC government in place, 
irregardless of the methods employed or how irregular the 
process has been. 
  "Because the future of 13 nations is at stake, the cost of 
the recent abortive election must not be regarded as a 
restraining factor when a further election is deemed necessary. 
The CP therefore demands that the legitimate demands of all 
interested parties and nations be considered all over again, so 
that a satisfactory compromise can be reached before any other 
election is convened. The constitution's shortcomings must also 
be eliminated and the incompetent IEC be replaced by the 
Department of Home Affairs. An election must then be arranged 
on an ethnic basis for those nations which so prefer." 
  According to Dr. Hartzenberg, the events during the election 
prove that the CP was right in its decision not to participate 
in it. "The CP's predictions relating to the forced time scales 
and the warnings regarding the incompetence of the IEC seem to 
have been correct." 
  Meanwhile, leader of the HNP [Reformed National Party], Mr. 
Jaap Marais, has threatened to challenge the validity of 
elections in court. He said in a statement that the 
authenticity of the election was out of the question, since the 
lack of proper administration led to corruption and fraud. "The 
result can definitely not be accepted in South Africa, neither 
can it be recognized internationally. 
  Mr. Marais added that the statement by the IEC on the 
legality of the election is invalid.

  [Text] The South African National Defense Force [SANDF] 
says it is not in a position to handle peace-keeping operations 
outside the borders of South Africa. The defense force said 
that a decision to deploy the SANDF outside South Africa was a 
political one, to be taken by the government of national unity. 
However, several practical implications would have to 
considered. These included the strain on manpower, logistics, 
and funds caused by the integration of about 30,000 people into 
the force. Moreover, the legal aspects would have to be 
resolved before there could be any involvement in a major role 
beyond the borders. The SANDF was reacting to speculation about 
the possible role of the force in operations outside South 
Africa.

  [Text] The Afrikaans Handelsinstitut [Trade Institute--AHI] 
has appealed to the ANC not to act over-hastily in introducing 
drastic, uncoordinated reforms in certain sectors such as 
agriculture. AHI President Nols Olivier said the reforms should 
not be carried out before the programs and policy directions had 
been subjected to full and thorough examination by all role 
players. He said the policy proposals should also be exposed 
within the scope of national goals aimed at urgent short-term 
deficiencies, but with the retention of long-term survival and 
sound development strategies in mind.

  [Text] The commercial rand has slumped to its lowest level 
yet against both the dollar and sterling. It hit a low of 3 
rands 67.5 cents against the dollar this morning. Reserve Bank 
intervention helped lift the rand to a slightly better close of 
3 rands 66.33 cents to the dollar. However, it is still the 
weakest closing level ever. 
  The rand also suffered a deep depreciation against sterling 
to trade at 5 rands 50.5 cents against the British currency. 
The rand was last close to this level in September 1992 when a 
crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism led to sterling 
losing heavily against the rand.

  [Text] Nairobi -- The African Development Bank [ADB] ended 
its annual meeting in Nairobi on Friday with crucial reform of 
its lending policy left up in the air and its soft loan fund 
bare. 
  Western countries declined at the three-day meeting to top 
up 
the African Development Fund until the bank implemented 
internal reforms recommended by independent experts and adopted 
policies to tackle mounting arrears on loans to member states. 
"Certain steps have to be taken following the report and 
certain policies adopted on resource allocation before we can 
commit new funds," Britain's senior representative Barry Hudson 
told the meeting. 
  The bank's problems are believed to be behind the caution 
shown by SA in joining the bank, now that political objections 
to its membership have been removed. 
  The meeting was attended by two SA observers, Eltie Links of 
the Finance Department and Development Bank of Southern Africa 
CE [chief executive] Andre la Grange. They presented a letter 
expressing SA's interest in negotiating membership, but 
indicated this would take some time. 
  SA's caution is linked to the bank's parlous financial 
position -- it has liabilities of $700m [million] -- and the 
cost of the shareholding being offered, which is reported to be 
$275m over five years, with close to $2bn [billion] on call. 
  Representatives of the African and non-African members 
agreed 
to meet again, probably towards the end of June, according to 
incoming chairman, Nigerian Finance Minister Kalu Idika Kalu. 
  In talks that ended late on Thursday, the two sides came 
close to agreement on a replenishment worth around $2.6bn to the 
Development Fund. However, at the last minute some African 
states, led by Nigeria, rejected the country categories wanted 
by the Western countries, which would distinguish creditworthy 
countries that could borrow from the bank from others eligible 
only for interest-free loans from the fund. 
  As a result, the replenishment pledges were withdrawn. Donor 
countries are alarmed at the mounting arrears on loans given by 
the bank, now more than $700m. The donors say only those 
countries with per capita income of more than $1,054 a year 
should be deemed good credit risks. SA would easily qualify on 
these terms. 
  Countries with per capita income of $543 would be able to 
borrow only from the fund. 
  Kalu told reporters the per capita income criterion was too 
rigid, especially at a time of fluctuating economic conditions 
in Africa. Members should look at supplementary indicators of 
economic health. 
  The bank's vice-president for southern Africa, Adewale 
Sangowawa, is due to visit Johannesburg later this month to tie 
up arrangements for a conference on the bank in the city in 
October.

<F P=106> [By Ciaran Ryan] </F>
  [Text] The National Party [NP] Government sent the national 
debt soaring by more than R[Rand] 60-billion in its final year 
of power. The money was spent on tidying up the nation's books 
and settling some apartheid debts. 
  Economists warn that SA [South Africa] is careering to South 
American-style debt and future generations will bear a heavy 
burden. The nine new regions will shoulder part of the 
R15-billion debt inherited from the homelands. Finance 
Director-General Estian Calitz says the regions will be 
responsible only for "that portion of the debt linked to assets". 
  Most of it will be taken over by the Government. It is faced 
with a 13 percent rise in the interest bill from R20.5-billion 
in 1993-94 to about R23-billion -- the largest item in the next 
budget. 
  Mike Brown, economist at stockbroker Frankel Pollak 
Vinderine, says: "State debt is approaching danger levels. The 
real problem is the rate at which the interest burden is rising 
relative to economic growth." 
  Economist Edward Osborn says the interest burden is running 
out of control, restricting the new Government's ability to 
embark on radical spending programmes. "There is no easy way 
out. The new administration inherits the problems caused by 
decades of economic mismanagement. The country is in a 
public-debt trap." 
  Total State debt is more than R200-billion, about 55 percent 
of gross domestic product [GDP]. This compares with 
R155-billion, or 46.5 percent of GDP, in March last year. 
  It is still shy of the internationally accepted ceiling of 
60 
percent of GDP. 
  In a valedictory vote of thanks to public servants, 
government stock of R7.3-billion was issued to offset the 
R29-billion actuarial shortfall in State pension funds. 
  The outgoing Government borrowed R30.5-billion in the past 
year to balance the Budget, bringing to R45-billion the amount 
of interest-bearing stock issued for the year. The interest is 
R4- billion. 
  Dr Calitz says: "The homeland debts were being serviced all 
along through transfers from SA and the homelands' own 
resources. Consolidating the homeland debt does not add to 
overall expenditure, it merely shifts its location." 
  Notions that SA is "underborrowed", as suggested by some in 
the ANC, are rejected by economists. 
  Mr Brown says: "The reconstruction and development programme 
will have to be partially funded through the capital markets and 
this will strain the capacity of the market to absorb new debt 
issues. 
  "The Government will have to offer higher interest rates on 
new stock, adding to the interest burden." 
  Mr Osborn questions official figures showing the deficit for 
the year to March to be on target at 6.8 percent of GDP. "I 
suspect that they have fudged the final deficit figure. There 
is R2-billion of additional expenditure for the provinces which 
does not appear to have been accounted for." 
  Mr Osborn predicts the interest bill could be as high as 
R26- 
billion in the coming year. Finance officials dispute Mr 
Osborn's predictions. 
  Finance Minister Derek Keys says extra-budgetary commitments 
add R2-billion to the deficit.

  [Text] An economic upsurge in the next 2 years, a drop in 
the interest rates, and the retention of the current monetary 
policy are three of the main forecasts in the latest report by 
the Bureau for Economic Research at the Universityy of 
Stellenbosch, which has just been released. 
  The bureau said that a good performance could be expected 
from the economy, both this year and next year, and that the 
expected upswing would be based solidly on politics. Long-term 
investment rates were expected to begin showing a downward trend 
this year, because of the anticipated low inflation and money 
market rates. Monetary policy was expected to remain unchanged. 
  The bureau said it would require exceptional negotiating 
skills from the government of national unity, as a government of 
freedom, to meet the high expectations created among the masses 
during the elections. The bureau said it would be difficult to 
avert a further increase in the budget deficit in a 
non-inflationary way without sacrificing economic growth. 
Proposed expenditure and possible state loans next year would 
probably lead to tax increases, and to a rise in long-term 
interest rates.

  [Text] The premier of the Orange Free State, Mr. Patrick 
Lekota, has admonished the people of the region to respect 
government leaders. He was speaking at Springbok Park in 
Bloemfontein where many were celebrating their freedom. Even 
the premier moved to the beat of the music. In his address Mr. 
Lekota said the leaders in the new government will have to be 
given a chance. He said, however, that the ideas of Mr. Eugene 
Terreblanche and Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and all who entertained 
their war mongering ideas will not be given a chance. A 
government spokesman, Reverend Motlalepule Shabaku, urged 
students to dedicate their time to school work for a bright 
future. He said the time when a black man was passed up for a 
job because of the color of his skin is now over.

  [Text] Mmabatho public servants have decided on an 
indefinite go-slow strike. The decision was taken in defiance 
of a call by the North-West premier, Mr. Popo Molefe, for them 
to act in a professional manner. The approximately 500 civil 
servants also expressed their anger at Mr. Molefe for slamming 
their demands for salary parity with white officials. A senior 
official said that before the elections Mr. Molefe had termed 
the demand as their right, now he referred to it as stupid.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The 
Pretoria/Witwatersrand /Vereeniging's [PWV] first "law and order 
minister" Jessie Duarte says her priority is to reduce crime in 
the region. But she also plans to make the police more 
responsible to the community. Ms Duarte was speaking to 
journalists after being sworn in as PWV Executive Committee 
member for public safety and security at Sandton, north of 
Johannesburg, on Friday. 
  Her central philosophy was community policing which involved 
locals getting to know policemen in their areas. Complaints 
against policemen would be taken seriously, and she further 
suggested an independent ombudsman to examine complaints not 
handled properly by police. 
  While insisting police should act against suspects within 
clearly defined perameters, she would have little sympathy for 
criminals, even those motivated by poverty. "We are not going to 
make excuses for criminal activities... We think people ought to 
learn how to respect the rights of other people." 
  On the police's Internal Stability Division [ISD], Ms Duarte 
proposed some of its 8,000 members in the region be integrated 
into other units. The policing budget, effective until March 
1995, did not allow her to increase personnel, so increased 
visible policing would be achieved by a reshuffle. 
  But she ruled out disbanding the ISD at this stage. "We 
can't 
lose their skills." 
  Ms Duarte was confident the PWV police force would not be 
controlled by Safety and Security Minister Sidney Mufamadi. His 
proposal for a council of ministers from the nine regions 
suggested there would be an integrated police service. 
  Ms Duarte, who has worked as a special assistant to ANC 
leader Nelson Mandela since the unbanning of the African 
National Congress in early 1990, agreed she was not a stranger 
to law and order. She was restricted in terms of emergency 
regulations from 1986 until the ANC's unbanning. 
  In 1989, Ms Duarte was detained at Johannesburg's "Sun City" 
prison for eight months. But she has no ill feelings: "It's all 
in the past."

  [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- Jabu Moleketi, the PWV's 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] MEC [Member Executive 
Committee] for economic affairs and finance, wants to develop 
small business and manufacturing in the region. This would be 
part of a "dynamic strategy" involving government, the private 
sector and labour, he told journalists after he and nine other 
people were sworn on to the PWV Executive Committee at Sandton, 
north of Johannesburg, on Friday. 
  Mr Moloketi has already formed a strategic management 
committee of people with technical know-how. His chief concerns 
are a better quality of life for everyone, promoting small 
business and manufacturing and increasing jobs. 
  Contributing 40 per cent of the country's gross domestic 
product, the PWV must co-operate with the other eight provinces 
and ensure its strategy complements national efforts, but not to 
the detriment of the PWV, he believes. 
  Mr Moleketi, who matriculated in Soweto, was recruited into 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], the African National 
Congress' armed wing, in 1976. He spent about 14 years in exile 
in countries including the former Soviet Union, Cuba, Angola, 
Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. 
  Mr Moleketi returned to South Africa in November, 1990 and 
was soon elected as secretary of the South African Communist 
Party's PWV region, a post he still holds.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 13 SAPA -- The Azanian Peoples 
Organisation [AZAPO] on Friday urged the North-West government 
of Popo Molefe to grant immediate pay parity for civil servants 
in that region. "AZAPO objects in the strongest possible terms 
to the insinuation by the premier of the North-West region, Mr 
Popo Molefe, that there are elements behind the public servants' 
demands who seek to frustrate the work of the new government. 
  "AZAPO reminds Mr Molefe that the people of the North-West 
region overthrew the homeland regime without needing to be 
instigated by any 'elements'. They assumed their own power and 
exercised their democratic rights," said AZAPO official Mr Nkosi 
Molala. 
  "In the spirit of the discussions between the president of 
AZAPO, Prof Itumeleng Mosala, and the new president, Mr Nelson 
Rolihlahla Mandela, recently, that co-operation will be sought 
in matters on national interests between our organisations, we 
urge the premier of the North-West Region to refrain from 
insinuating that people cannot make demands from the new 
government unless they are instigated by someone else outside 
themselves," he concluded.

<F P=106> [By Farouk Chothia, Stephen Laufer, Chris Louw, Steuart </F>
Wright] 
  [Text] The new premier of the Northern Transvaal, Ngoake 
Ramatlhodi, is probably the least known of the provincial 
leaders. But the 38 year old has a long history of resisting 
apartheid since his days as a student leader in Lesotho, where 
he lived in exile for 10 years. 
  Ramatlhodi -- currently deputy registrar and executive 
assistant to the principal of the University of North -- was 
described this week by his vice-chancellor, Professor Njabulo 
Ndebele, as "fair- minded, extremely warm and caring and very 
competent. 
  "You can expect a very self-effacing premier, but extremely 
insightful in his understanding of issues." 
  Ndebele has known Ramatlhodi since 1983, when the latter was 
the president of the students' representative council at the 
National University in Lesotho and Ndebele was head of the 
department of English. "I remember him as a very energetic 
leader. Then I didn't seem him for a long time; the South 
African government exerted pressure on the ANC to leave 
Lesotho, so most of the people left. I only met him again when 
I came back." 
  Ramatlhodi was born at Tauetswala, a small village near 
Potgietersrus, on August 2 1955. His father was a mineworker 
and his mother a housewife. 
  In 1976 he enrolled for Bjuris at the University of North, 
where he made his name as a poet. Expelled in 1977 for his 
political activities, he was later allowed back, but left for 
exile on July 17 1980. Today Ramatlhodi holds a masters degree 
in law from the University of Lesotho. 
  He is known to get along very easily with a wide range of 
people. Says Ndebele: "I expect him to be somebody who will be 
easily acceptable to the different communities in the Northern 
Transvaal. 
  "He can be a person around whom differences can be resolved. 
  "He inspires confidence and is very self-effacing in a very 
humble sort of way, but at the same time can project qualities 
of fairmindedness which are necessary when you get into a 
leadership position." 
  Ndebele thought Ramatlhodi would be ably suited to deal with 
the rightwing in his area: "He is willing, in the tradition of 
the ANC, to meet and talk to everybody, so I don't think he will 
pre-judge the rightwing before meeting with them. "He already 
said on television that his position is that everyone who is 
born here, belongs here, and that he would want to make everyone 
comfortable. 
  "I would presume that if the rightwing presents itself as a 
problem, it will not be because the premier is unwilling to meet 
them, but because they themselves prefer to be a difficulty." 
  The bespectacled Frank Mdlalose has two qualities which will 
stand him in good stead as premier of KwaZulu/Natal: a good ear 
to listen to gripes and an ability to remain impartial when 
dissent wrecks a party -- abilities honed in chairing Inkatha 
Freedom Party central committee meetings since 1976. Both 
qualities will be tested once he assumes his functions as 
premier: with the ANC also represented in the 10-member 
provincial cabinet, Mdlalose faces the task of seeking consensus 
in a divided cabinet and pushing ahead with peace initiatives 
and economic development. 
  By choosing him as its premier, the IFP [Inkatha Freedom 
Party] signalled it wants improved relations with the ANC in 
KwaZulu/Natal. Mdlalose has built a strong rapport over the 
years with his ANC rival, Jacob Zuma -- both have been at the 
forefront of attempts to end the 10-year long carnage in the 
province. 
  But Mdlalose's greatest strength -- remaining non-partisan 
-- 
is also seen as a weakness. It has resulted in his failing to 
stamp his authority over IFP hardliners and "warloads" who will 
feature prominently in the provincial legislature. 
  He is also said to be a leader who prefers not to antagonise 
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. It is also said that he has, on 
occasion, read speeches drafted by Buthelezi's close confidante, 
IFP hardliner Walter Felgate, despite disagreeing with their 
contents. 
  While Mdlalose does not lack experience in the political 
arena -- he was minister of the interior in the kwaZulu homeland 
and co- leader of the IFP's negotiating team at the World Trade 
Centre talks -- there is concern in IFP circles over his health. 
Aged 61, he suffered from exhaustion last year after endless 
constitutional wrangles and subsequently fractured his knee in a 
car accident. Reliant on a walking stick, he subsequently fell 
in the bathroom and injured himself again. 
  But Mdlalose is once more assuming a high public profile in 
KwaZulu/Natal. Caught up in the hurly-burly of politics, 
Mdlalose finds he has little time to concentrate on his other 
interests: tennis and boxing. 
  In his brash self-confidence, Mathews Phosa is the ANC 
regional premier best able to match Western Cape supremo Hernus 
Kriel. Secure in the knowledge of his overwhelming election 
victory in the Eastern Transvaal, the former head of the ANC's 
legal department is likely to be a leader in testing the limits 
of regional independence and room to manoeuvre under the 
constitution. 
  Phosa and Kriel have locked horns several times in the 
recent 
past, and the every-smiling Phosa was rarely bested by the 
former law and order minister in arguments over such sensitive 
issues as joint SAP[South African Police]/ANC investigations 
into the murder of Chris Hani and the shootout between policemen 
and Walter Sisulu's bodyguards. But ANC constitutional experts 
intent on solidifying the centralist aspects of the new 
dispensation could find the two men joining forces in 
championing regional powers. 
  Phosa lists law and business as long-standing interests -- 
he 
made a name for himself as one of the jurists who fought the 
South African government's intention to give kaNgwane to 
Swaziland. But he is first and foremost a politician, a man who 
enjoys the limelight and the rough-and-tumble of crossing swords 
with his adversaries. 
  At 41, he has opted for the premiership of his home region 
rather than take his chances in the race for a position in the 
national cabinet. While respected for his role in the ANC 
underground -- after military training in East Germany he ran 
Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] 
structures in the Eastern Transvaal -- Phosa is said to have 
faded as a frontrunner for a cabinet positions because he had 
detractors at Shell House. 
  Born in Mbombela township, Nelspruit, Phosa spent his early 
years with his grandfather in Potgietersrus, learning 
traditional skills such as hunting, fishing, and tilling. His 
political education came from his mother, a nurse during World 
War II he describes as "highly political". 
  On the location of the new Eastern Transvaal capital, Phosa 
has said the decision is still open. With opposing lobbies 
favouring Nelspruit and Witbank, his wish to see his three 
children grow up in his home town might just tip the scales. 
  Having recently turned 35, Manne Dipico could well have 
found himself contemplating the end of his career as a semi- 
professional soccer player. But politics intervened, forcing 
him to hand up his boots prematurely as he chased a majority for 
the ANC in the Northern Cape. 
  Less than half the age of Eastern Cape premier Raymond 
Mhlaba, who is 74, Dipico will be the youngest of the nine 
regional premiers when he is sworn in tomorrow. But don't 
underestimate him, say former colleagues in the National Union 
of Mineworkers [NUM] -- Dipico is an independent thinker, a hard 
worker and a popular figure in the region. 
  And, they might have added, an example of how the unions 
nurtured a generation of political leaders through the 1980s. 
"His popularity in the Northern Cape is not an abstract thing," 
said NUM deputy general secretary Gwede Mantashe. "People know 
him, and the fact we won the region despite predictions to the 
contrary is a testament to his ability." 
  Dipico was born in Kimberley's Greenpoint township and 
brought up by his mother, a domestic worker at the town's 
hospital. He was fired from De Beers' Finsch Mine for 
participating in a wage strike, and later enrolled at the 
University of Fort Hare. 
  An Azanian Student's Organisation activist while at 
University, he also joined the ANC's underground structures, and 
was detained for his anti-Ciskei activities. Denied readmission 
to Fort Hare on his release, he became a fulltime regional 
organiser for the NUM in Kimberley. 
  "He is a team person," commented Mantashe. "He will do his 
best to exploit everybody's experience and abilities in the 
region, even those of the NP." Doing so will require the charm 
and skill Dipico has exhibited as head of the NUM's education 
department. He has had to put behind him the memories of his 
three years in jail for furthering the aims of the ANC. 
  Unmarried and without children, Dipico has a major task 
ahead 
of him as father of the Northern Cape, feels Mantashe. "The 
area is rich in mineral and agricultural resources. The 
challenge will be to bring investment t?ere which will allow 
value to be added to the raw products. If he succeeds, the 
Northern Cape can have the highest per capita income in the 
country." 
  In the 1952 defiance campaign in Port Elizabeth a young ANC 
activist climbed the stairs at New Brighton Station to sit on a 
"Europeans Only" bench. He was arrested and spend a month in 
jail. More than 40 years later, Ray Mhlaba (74) climbed ?he same 
stairs as the ANC's Eastern Cape premier candidate to tell 
thousands of supporters he had already tested the new region's 
s?at of power in Bisho. 
  Sitting behind the desk left vacant by Ciskei dictator 
Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, Mhlaba told Ciskei administrator Bongani 
Finca: "We are going to rule this country and make sure that no 
black man uses the word 'baas' [boss] to a white man. Those 
days are gone." 
  The incident marked the end of Mhlaba's struggle for freedom 
as he faced the daunting task of governing u region laced with 
apartheid's leftovers. 
  His position as head of regional government confirmed by 
election results, Mhalaba muf? oversee the creation of a single 
bureaucracy from what remains of Transkei, Ciskei and the Cape 
Pronvicial Administration and the appointment of senior public 
servants. 
  Also burdened with addressing health, housing and education 
in the region, human rights campaigner and close friend Rory 
Riordan is confident Mhlaba will rise to the challenge. A 
former Robben Islander, Mhlaba is among the ANC's "leadership 
which is unmatched by any political party on earth. 
  "He has an unbelievable grasp of political events and an 
extraordinary capacity to read people and to move them to where 
they should be," he says. 
  From the cradle of the liberation movement, the Eastern 
Cape, 
Mhlaba was born in Fort Beaufort and has been inextricably 
linked to the politics of the region. 
  He became involved in the trade union movement in the 1940s 
and is now deputy chairman of the SACP [South African Communist 
Party]. 
  His leadership first made headlines in 1949 when he headed a 
boycott against the South African Railway's discriminatory bus 
service. In 1950 he was banned under the Suppression of 
Communism Act and in 1952 he led the defiance campaign in the 
Eastern Cape. 
  Long-standing colleague Govan Mbeki says Mhlaba showed the 
same leadership in the ANC's underground structures. Ray is a 
very courageous person and if there is something that requires 
fighting he will be the first to jump in, but in the present 
situation I think he will continue to keep his cool," he adds. 
  Faced with reconciling the past, Mhlaba has already welcomed 
the opportunity to work with the NP's Tertius Delport in the 
regional government. 
  Mbeki stresses that one of Mhlaba's greatest virtues is that 
he readily smiles and readily laughs and I think that will see 
him a long way to being accepted by the people with whom he is 
working."

<F P=106> [Report by Reg Rummey] </F>
  [Text] Co-ordinator of the ANC's Reconstruction and 
Development Programme [RDP] in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, 
Vereeniging] region Ben Turok believes resources should be 
redirected from white suburbs towards black townships. If that 
means whites will have to suffer a rise in rates and service 
charges to pay for what they have become accustomed to, so be 
it. "People must pay for the resources they receive." 
  Turok, one of the framers of the Freedom Charter, is best 
known for his uncompromisingly critical stance towards 
international finance. He believes that apartheid biased the 
economy towards whites and that it has to be reshaped. "Luxury" 
and "lop-sided" are two words that recur often as he speaks. 
Turok cites a November 1993 World Bank study, Paths to Economic 
Growth: "Public investment should not be directed to 
infrastructure in white areas." 
  Apartheid distorted the economy and investment, so that the 
focus must now fall on the townships. Further, the urban areas 
have sufficient capacity to reduce backlogs "without recourse to 
additional revenue from central government." 
  This, says Turok, fits in with his theme that South Africa 
has a "skyscraper economy surrounded by shanty towns." Turok 
believes whites receive hidden subsidies compared to township 
residents. He has one example. Businesses pay 9c [cents] a 
kilowatt hour (kWh) in central Johannesburg for electricity, 
while blacks pay 18c per kWh in Soweto. 
  "It is inconceivable poor people should pay double what 
businesses pay," Turok says. "White South Africa has had a 
cushioned life on the basis of political power. Apartheid meant 
the white minority not only has a high income but also 
subsidised services," he believes. He adds: "There needs to be 
a lot of research to examine the phenomenon." 
  What will the political effect be of township residents 
continuing their non-payment for rents and services? "The whole 
strategy of the RDP is based on payment," says Turok. "If we 
are not able to get cost recovery in the townships then the 
whole strategy will be under pressure." By the same token, if 
they do pay the equity argument is strengthened. 
  "We are not in the business of killing the golden goose," he 
adds, noting that foreign investors would like a pleasant, 
secure environment and a good lifestyle. "But we cannot 
maintain a colonial system, where a small elite live a very easy 
lifestyle with cheap services when most of the people live in 
poverty. It's untenable." 
  In line with this, the economy itself has to be reshaped. 
The first priority is to establish a township economy, 
including African-style markets. Turok says any analysis of the 
manufacturing sector acknowledges that mass consumption goods 
has not been its priority. There has, he says, been a bias 
towards manufacture of goods for upper-income people as against 
basic needs commodities. 
  Many African countries, he says, have established production 
-- or at least assembly -- of cheap radios or radio-cassette 
players. "To my knowledge radio-cassette players are not 
manufactured in South Africa. They are not even assembled 
here." Cheap bicycles may be made in South Africa, but their 
production is not pushed, he says. "They are not made on a big 
scale. In most Third World countries people use scooters to go 
to work." Here, he says, the duties on imported scooters make 
them prohibitive. 
  Turok recognises the argument that it might be better to 
export, say, Mercedes Benz cars and import bicycles from China 
where big economies of scale make the cost of manufacture 
competitive. But he says it is important to build an all-round 
industry so that you have a larger base. "If you depend on 
hi-tech exports you are in danger of creating a lop-sided 
economy." The economy must have a local base, Turok argues, and 
an economy without mass-based production is unhealthy. 
  Turok has the impression from visiting local supermarkets in 
the rural areas that such production as there is of cheap goods 
is shoddy. Goods such as clothing and footwear sold to people 
in rural areas, he says, "is cheap and of appalling quality." 
  What will the provincial powers do to redress what Turok 
sees 
as the skewness of the economy? 
  Turok says the RDP will set up parallel businesses rather 
than forcing existing business to follow orders. He says the 
steering group of the RDP has decided the main thrust of RDP 
industrial policy should be to establish a number of productive 
enterprises in and around the townships to produce basic goods. 
  Asked how the RDP planners know whether there is demand for 
such goods, Turok replies: "We do know there is demand. Any 
survey of township needs indicates people come in to town to do 
their shopping." 
  The Small Business Development Corporation, Turok considers, 
has not done enough, and has mainly given loans to whites. Big 
business, questioned about why there are no retail outlets in 
the township, describes the environment as unfriendly, says 
Turok. But he finds it difficult to understand why, for 
instance, banks do not set up more branches in Soweto, which has 
two-million residents. 
  The whole service sector is very badly served, he says, and 
the RDP must address this legacy. A pure market approach will 
not work. Finance for these projects will come from a variety of 
sources, including white and black business, foreign aid, and 
community resources such as stokvels [township fund-raising 
agreements]. 
  How much power do Turok and his team have? Turok says those 
in charge of the RDP in the PWV have substantial power to mould 
the programme. They have the power to pass legislation within 
the 29 competencies given by the constitution, including roads 
and health. 
  A draft of the RDP for the PWV was published last week. 
Experts from many areas, including business and development, 
have been invited to discuss the plan. Clearly, it is not cast 
in stone. Turok invites anyone with a planning background and 
knowledge of development who would like to make a contribution 
to the adaptation of the RDP to contact him.

Manne Dipico on Monday announced a 10-member Executive Council 
that includes five representatives of the African National 
Congress, four from the National Party [NP] and one from the

  Mr Dipico said he was appointing the front's Prof Jozef 
Henning to an unspecified Executive Council post even though the 
FF did not win enough votes to claim a seat. Similarly, the ANC 
proposed the Democratic Party's Ethne Papenfus as speaker. 
  Mr Dipico said he had been guided in his Executive Council 
appointments by the objective of "nation building". He said he 
had looked at the expertise available to accomplish the 
province's developmental needs. 
  Executive Council members, their party and the portfolios 
are: 
  Goolam Akharwaray, ANC, economic affairs, trade and 
industry 
  Tina Joemat, ANC, education and culture 
  Dr Modise Matlaopane, ANC, health and welfare 
  Ouneas Dikgetsi, ANC, local government, housing and land 
reform 
  Peter Gelderbloem, ANC, police services 
  Jacobus Marais, NP, agriculture 
  Jan Brazelle, NP, finance 
  Peggy Hollander, NP, public works 
  Charl van Wyk, NP, transport 
  Jozef Henning, FF, unspecified. 
  The Northern Cape's senators were also announced. 
  They are the ANC's Koos Bogacwi, Yolanda Botha, Evelyn 
Lubidla, Julius Mongoaketse and Mohamed Sulliman; the NP's Kraai 
van Niekerk, Attie Jooste, Adrian van Niekerk and a name still 
to be confirmed. The front's representative also has to be 
announced.

transitional process in the province were announced. At the 
show grounds, Mr. Phosa accepted the general salute from a 
combined national defense force and police parade. In his first 
address to the public, Mr. Phosa said it was important that 
referenda be held as soon as possible to determine in which

  [Text] The independent political magazine WORK IN PROGRESS 
will close down next week because of a long-standing financial 
crisis. Funding problems will finally achieve what several 
National Party governments failed to do -- silence one of the 
most articulate voices against apartheid. 
  "WIP's funding base -- primarily donor agencies in Europe -- 
has all but disappeared as (they) have cut back on support for 
projects in South Africa," said editor Chris Vick in a statement. 
  "Because several funding pledges have not materialised, or 
have been delayed considerably, the magazine is heavily in debt." 
  Vick said there was no possibility of getting substantial 
funding for the magazine in the near future. "Although we are 
entering a stage when those in power will be committed to 
democracy, justice and reconstruction, there is still going to 
be a need for watchdogs when can bark and bite." 
  Vick criticised the lack of support from potential 
advertisers and the commercial print media.

  [Text] Durban May 16 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] 
spokesman Ed Tillett on Monday said some sections of South 
Africa's news media were eating humble pie after the IFP's 
election triumph in KwaZulu/Natal. "I think certain sections of 
the media have tended to swallow their own propaganda and myth," 
he said. "Prior to the elections the debate on federalism was 
stifled and instead editorials turned out a bland uniformity of 
thinking." 
  Mr Tillett also criticised opinion surveys, saying most had 
predicted three per cent national support for the IFP. However, 
the party garnered 10.5 per cent of the votes for the National 
Assembly. "It would appear sections of the media were paralysed 
into impotency by their transitional jargon and the media 
appeared to lapse into a certain lingua franca of...informed 
speculation." 
  Prof Keyan Tomaselli of the University of Natal's Centre for 
Cultural and Media Studies on Monday said incorrect predictions 
of support for the IFP were due to unreliable population 
statistics provided by the state, particularly for rural and 
peri-urban areas. 
  He said the IFP had lost the support of the English press in 
the past year because it had become a threat to economic 
stability and therefore a menace to big business. The English 
press was free- market orientated, he said, and naturally sided 
with business.

  [Text] A fight broke out this morning between two factions 
of Radio Pretoria supporters over the resumption of broadcasts. 
The station has been closed after a prohibition on further 
transmissions by the Supreme Court. Rev. Mossie van den Berg, 
chairman of the Executive Committee, had recommended that the 
station should wait on a final decision from the Independent 
Broadcasting Authority regarding the issue of a license to the 
station. 
  According to the station's spokesperson, Commandant Piet le 
Roux, Rev. van der Berg this morning addressed supporters, and 
Mr. Manie Maritz, a prominent right-winger, asked to express his 
views. He asked that a new Executive Committee be elected. A 
fight broke out. According to Commandant le Roux, the conflict 
began when Rev. van der Berg instructed that the station be 
closed down. The opposing faction is now threatening to resume 
transmissions next week.

planning a massive bomb explosion at Jan Smuts Airport on the 
day of President Nelson Mandela's inauguration six days ago. 
  This information was revealed in the Johannesburg Regional 
Court during a bail application by 32 right wingers detained in 
connection with last month's bomb explosion in the PWV 
[Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] province. The head of 
the Witwatersrand Crime Intelligence Service, Col. Neels van 
Wyk, testified that up to 5 tonnes of explosives would have been 
used in the second Jan Smuts attack. The police seized 80 
firearms and 60 kilograms of explosives, and since the arrest of 
the men there has been no further similar incident.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 16 SAPA -- An Inkatha Freedom Party 
[IFP] branch chairman on the East Rand and a member of the 
Katlehong Peace Committee were killed on Sunday when the taxi 
they were travelling in came under fire from unknown gunmen. The 
latest in a resurgence of violence on the East Rand, the 
killings prompted the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] 
regional government to propose community policing be introduced 
in the region. 
  Police spokesman Capt Janine Smith reported the IFP's 
chairman at Simmer and Jack Mines near Katlehong, Wilson 
Buthelezi, 43, and Katlehong Peace Committee member Muzi 
Sithole, 31, were shot dead when men with AK-47 rifles opened 
fire on their taxi at 5.30PM on the road between Zonkesizwe and 
Palmridge. 
  The attackers fled in a white Toyota Corolla. 
  Reacting to the killings, IFP East Rand regional organiser 
Thabani Dlamini said in a statement: "We call on the African 
National Congress East Rand region to meet with us so that we 
can work hand-in-hand to defuse the anger of the people of our 
region who have suffered so much in the recent violence through 
these senseless killings". 
  Mr Dlamini said neither organisation gained anything from 
the 
violence. "We are distressed by the wave of violence sweeping 
through the East Rand townships, particularly Tokoza and 
Katlehong, and we call upon everyone in these communities to do 
everything possible to rebuild peace." 
  PWV Public Safety and Security Minister Jessie Duarte called 
for urgent attention to be given to the implementation of 
policing that included the involvement of self-defence units, 
SABC radio reported. Ms Duarte was speaking after a visit to 
Tokoza, where 12 people were massacred at the weekend. 
  The IFP has attributed the flare-up in violence to new 
soldiers not knowing the location of trouble spots.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 16 SAPA -- An SA National Defence 
Force patrol on Monday found the body of a 20-year-old man 
believed to have been "necklaced" in Tokoza on the East Rand, 
SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news 
reports. The charred body was found at about 2PM on the corner 
of Lekwane and Masibuko Streets -- about two blocks away from 
the Tokoza hostels. 
  Inkatha Freedom Party whip in the PWV [Pretoria, 
Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] legislature Gertrude Mzizi told 
reporters at the scene the victim was believed to have been an 
IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] member allegedly caught by a mob in 
a known African National Congress stronghold. 
  Mrs Mzizi expressed the belief that violence had flared up 
in 
the East Rand townships after a quiet spell during the elections 
because of the new troop deployment there. She said acts of 
criminal and political violence had increased because the new 
troops were unfamiliar with the area, especially the hot-spots. 
However, the situation could improve as they got to know the 
area better. 
  The police said the motive for the killing was unknown but a 
murder docket had been opened.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 14 SAPA -- Twelve people were 
killed -- execution style -- by unknown gunmen firing AK47 
rifles in Thokoza on the East Rand on Friday night, police said. 
The motive for the attack, which occurred at 7.30PM, was 
unknown. 
  Police Spokesman Capt Janine Smith said on Saturday the 
victims, with ages ranging between 13 and 25, were inside a 
house in Unit F in Thokoza when the gunmen stormed it and fired 
on them. Ten bodies were found inside the house and two others 
outside on the premises. All the bodies had bullet wounds. 
  Capt Smith said it appeared the youths had been staying in 
the house for about a month and that the previous owners vacated 
it some time ago. It was not known at this stage if the victims 
were affiliated to any political grouping. Spent AK47 
cartridges were found on the scene. 
  No further details were given and police were investigating.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 14 SAPA -- Police and troops raided 
three migrant workers' hostels in Vosloorus on the East Rand on 
Saturday morning and seized firearms, including 13 AK47 rifles 
and arrested several inmates, the South African National Defence 
Force said. The Witwatersrand Army Command said in a statement 
soldiers had also seized two detonators, 25 teargas canisters, 
three handgrenades and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and 
12 magazines and two RPG [rocket propelled grenades] 
propellants. The troops cordoned off the Nguni, Sotho and Clover 
Hostels about 5AM and searched them after authorities had 
received information "of the influx of illegal weapons into the 
area". 
  "Over the past several weeks the members of the National 
Defence Force deployed in the area came under regular shots 
fired from these hostels," the statement said. 
  Several people were arrested during the raid and 35 assorted 
weapons, including AK47 rifles were seized. The firearms 
included 13 AK47 rifles, a .22 Bruno rifle, two 9mm Walter 
pistols, four Makarov pistols, one pellet gun, one double barrel

  [Text] Johannesburg May 15 SAPA -- Three Tokoza hostels 
were cordoned off on Sunday afternoon after violence flared 
again in the volatile East Rand township. Witwatersrand army 
command spokesman Maj Christo Visser told SAPA the South African 
National Defence Force [SAVDF] cordoned off the area around 
Hostels One, Two and Three after claims that minibus taxi 
commuters had been abducted and were being held in the hostels. 
A taxi passing the hostels was shot at at about 3.30PM on 
Sunday, he said. Its occupants tried to flee but were allegedly 
abducted by hostel inmates. African National Congress 
supporters marched to the hostel and demanded to accompany a 
search of the hostels but this was rejected by hostel dwellers. 
Maj Visser said SANDF reinforcements had been sent to the area 
and on Sunday night members were trying to stabilise the 
situation which was described as "tense but under control".

<F P=106> [By Micel Schnehage] </F>
  [Text] Johannesburg May 15 SAPA -- A potentially explosive 
situation was defused in Tokoza on the East Rand on Sunday night 
when three abducted taxi commuters were released by hostel 
inmates. The hostages were released unharmed after South African 
National Defence Force [SANDF] intervention. 
  Witwatersrand army command spokesman Maj Christo Visser said 
the three people were dragged into Hostels One, Two and Three 
after their minibus was hijacked at about 3.30PM on Sunday. 
  Angry African National Congress supporters then marched on 
the hostels, demanding to accompany a search of the complexes, 
but this was rejected by hostel residents. 
  Cordons were drawn around the hostels and SANDF 
reinforcements were deployed to stabilise the situation, which 
was described as "tense but under control". 
  By 8PM on Sunday crowds that had gathered outside the 
hostels 
had dispersed and relative calm had returned to the area. The 
cordons were removed but SANDF patrols in the area were stepped 
up and the situation was being monitored closely, Maj Visser 
said. 
  Early on Sunday morning a SANDF rifleman was shot dead near 
the hostel complex. A statement issued by Capt Sonja Nel from 
Group 41 said two SANDF members were on their way to the Tokoza 
railway station when they were confronted by four unknown men 
who demanded to know where they were going and why they were 
wearing ANC tracksuits. 
  The SANDF members replied that they were on their way to the 
station and were wearing tracksuits belonging to the force. The 
two riflemen produced their SANDF drivers licences to prove 
their identities. The four men grabbed one of the rifleman, 
while the other soldier ran away to seek help. 
  A patrol sent to search for the rifleman found him dead in 
front of the Tokoza Hostel. His name would be released once his 
next-of- kin had been informed. 
  Meanwhile, the names of eight of the 12 people killed 
execution-style by unknown gunmen on Friday night were released 
by police spokeswoman Capt Janine Smith. They are Paulus 
Nhlapo, 13, Zakele Mvumu, 20, Raymond Kubeka, 20, Freddie 
Lehoko, 19, Siphiwe Ngema, 18, Tulani Mthumalo, over 18 years of 
age, Colin Nthumalo, 19 and Lucky Poole, 19. The names of the 
other four victims will be released once their next-of-kin have 
been informed. 
  Friday night's massacre and Sunday's killing and abduction 
raised fears that violence -- which claimed 2,000 lives on the 
East Rand last year -- would increase. Until Friday, violence 
had abated in the East Rand townships of Tokoza, Katlehong and 
Vosloorus since South Africa's first all-race election at the 
end of April. 
  Leaders in the newly-appointed government of national unity 
have vowed to end the violence, which has claimed about 15,000 
lives since political reform began in 1990.

  [Text] Durban May 16 SAPA -- At least 13 people were 
murdered in KwaZulu/Natal at the weekend, bringing to at least 
425 the number killed since a state of emergency was declared in 
the province at the end of March. The Human Rights Committee 
said on Monday it had asked the government to lift the state of 
emergency because violence had declined and there had been no 
change in the number of detainees, 63. Spokesman Ms Linda 
Mclean said violence last week was at its lowest ebb since June. 
She said more than 1,000 people had been murdered in the first 
four months of the year, an average of 55 a week. [passage 
omitted] Besides the 13 murders, police reported the suicide of 
a policeman at Umlazi, south of Durban, and the discovery of a 
decomposed body at KwaMakutha on the south coast.

in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 17 May on page 14 notes. 
"But, that said, employers and workers alike must agree we have 
had more than our share of holidays. Much as the time off was 
appreciated, the days off were totally disruptive of work 
schedules." Taking the discussion one step further, the 
editorial then asks if it is not "time now to look afresh at the 
number of public holidays and assess whether all are necessary," 
because the overabundance of holidays plays "havoc with 
productivity." 
  ANC Reaction to Mandela Retirement -- A second editorial on 
the same page of the 17 May THE STAR states that "the ANC is the 
government of a democracy now -- a democracy which needs to be 
nurtured. In this capacity the ANC is going to learn the hard 
way many lessons that might have looked easy. One of these is 
that comment is not always sensible, wise or constructive. It 
is sometimes plain stupid," the editorial states in reaction to 
the London SUNDAY TIMES article, which alleged that Mandela 
would retire after two years. Mandela's "response, instead of 
being a simple 'not true', was over-heavy: 'malicious 
disinformation .... rumour- mongering with the intention to 
create uncertainty.'" In conclusion the editorial notes that 
"the new government must begin to develop a thick skin, right at 
the beginning." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Urgency of New Housing Plan -- "We are encouraged by the 
urgency with which Minister of Housing Joe Slovo wishes to start 
a national housing scheme," an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN 
in English on 17 May on page 8 states. "The ANC's reconstruction 
and development programme has set a target of 1 million 
lower-income houses in the next five years." It is "instructive 
to note that violence" has already begun in the "depressed 
areas"; "whatever the reasons for this, there is no doubt that 
the environment is which people live results in a flare-up of 
violence often from seemingly inconsequential causes. The 
politics of the past made it impossible for developers to build 
houses and attack the problem of the totally unsuitable 
hostels." "The Government should turn these hostels into 
suitable family condominiums." 
<H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>
  Home Truths -- "Housing Minister Joe Slovo's plans to create 
an adequate housing stock over the next five years will be more 
easily stated than executed," an editorial in the Johannesburg 
BUSINESS DAY in English on 17 May on page 16 notes, "as the 
target is already too daunting and the programme too ambitious." 
As "banks are unlikely to be eager lenders to people on low 
incomes," "an early policy statement on the role and 
establishment of a state-owned mortgage bank" is needed. "In 
theory labour-intensive construction is needed to create jobs, 
to stimulate the economy and to provide employees with the wages 
needed to buy homes. In practice, capital-intensive industrial 
building techniques might prove cheaper." "In theory, free 
market principles should apply," but "political considerations 
are equally weighty." "Rather than endorse targets that may not 
be realistic, Slovo should aim for and achieve the possible." 
  Violent Crime -- As "two major factors -- political 
instability and violence -- spurred most of the capital flight 
and emigration," "the first problem should diminish as the 
government foes work together." And since "it is obvious that 
crime levels are directly related to the critically high 
umemployment rate," "providing jobs is the government's stated 
priority," the second editorial in BUSINESS DAY on 17 May notes. 
"Reducing the crime rate and keeping it down will succeed only 
if other, longer-term social programmes succeed."

  [Text] Heavy clashes took place yesterday in N'Dalatando, 
the capital of Cuanza Norte Province. The clashes lasted for 
two and a half hours, at the end of which troops led by General 
Fateira were put to flight. The People's Armed Forces for the 
Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] abandoned several killed and large 
quantities of war materiel on the ground. Our forces captured 
Lieutenant Pdro Joao, son of Joao Andre and Antonica Pedro Andre 
and born in Cazenga in September 1974. He was assigned to the 
1st Company of the Tank Battalion. Our N'Dalatando 
correspondent Firmino Lukamba has other details: 
  FAPLA forces abandoned 45 killed. The local Military Command 
has meanwhile denied a Radio Nacional de Angola report from 
Cuito, saying UNITA forces stationed in N'Dalatando have been 
deployed elsewhere to take Cuito.

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] Peace may arrive in Angola 
soon. In exclusive statements to RDP1, Angolan Ambassador Rui 
Mingas assures that an agreement in Lusaka is very very near. 
This is a confirmation we had to try hard to extract from Rui 
Mingas: 
  [Begin recording] [Mingas] I can confirm it. Yes, it is very 
close, but what remains for... 
  [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] An understanding 
between the two sides? 
  [Mingas] I am not sure whether it is an understanding 
between 
the sides, or whether it a question of us obtaining concrete 
evidence that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] will really accept what is being proposed. 
  [Correspondent] It has been said in the past few days that 
an 
agreement in Lusaka is imminent. Can you confirm that 
information? Have you received reports of that happening? 
  [Mingas] Yes. I am convinced that the problem will be 
overcome by the end of June. 
  [Correspondent] Can you give us any details of the 
agreement? 
  [Mingas] No, no, I cannot give you any details, but I can 
tell you that as far as we are concerned we feel very 
optimistic. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] He did not reveal any secrets but it has all 
been 
said in Rui Mingas' silence.

  [Text] [Announcer] Rui Mingas has accused the United 
Nations of being too soft with UNITA [National Union for the 
Total Independence of Angola]. The Angolan ambassador in Lisbon 
stated that the United Nations is forgetting that UNITA does not 
respect UN Security Council resolutions: 
  [Begin recording] [Mingas] I think that the United Nations 
have long forgotten that there is a member country called 
Angola-- the Angolan Republic. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a criticism of the UN 
participation, rather the reduced UN participation in Angola? 
  [Mingas] No. More specifically, I am talking about the UN 
Security Council's excessive tolerance toward applying 
sanctions. You have to consider that the Republic of Angola is 
the member state of the United Nations and not a group of rebels 
like UNITA. The United Nations has not been set up to support 
or have solidarity with a group of rebels, instead, it was set 
up to preserve peace, promote unity among nations, and support 
its member countries. We are a UN member state and do not 
understand why, in practice, it looks more like it is UNITA that 
is a member state and not our government. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] That was Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in 
Lisbon 
who despite the criticism believes that, by June, peace will be 
a reality in Angola.

  [Text] We spoke to UNITA [National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola] spokesman Jorge Valentim in Lusaka a few 
moments ago. He confirmed all the information we obtained today 
from Rui Mingas, Angolan ambassador in Lisbon, and spoke about 
the great news for the Angolan people: 
  [Begin recording] [Valentim, on the telephone] Yes, we are 
negotiating, we resumed the talks today and, of course, the 
theme we have on the table is national reconciliation. We feel 
optimistic about reaching a positive result. 
  [Correspondent Salema] Can that result be reached by the 
beginning of June? 
  [Valentim] Without getting into precise chronology, we can 
say yes. We are even hoping to get it over very, very soon, we 
have that sort of political will, we have very good 
communications going on with the government and hope we will 
reach the end of the journey within the same spirit of 
understanding and open democratic debate. 
  [Salema] Will peace then arrive in Angola in June? 
  [Valentim] We hope so, this is great news for the people of 
our country. Not only the news of peace but also that of 
national reconciliation that will allow all Angolans to live 
together, regardless of political conviction, racial, and ethnic 
origins. [end recording] 
  That was UNITA's Jorge Valentim confirming to Madelena 
Salema 
that the Summer of 1994 may bring peace back to Angola.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks have entered what one could 
describe as the final stage. It is the most difficult phase, 
though, because it has to do with governing the country. 
Government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence 
of Angola] negotiators today began discussing national 
reconciliation. There are already differences about UNITA's 
participation at the various levels of government and the 
reinstatement of state administration to every corner of Angola. 
UNITA also wants to rule in Benguela and Huambo Provinces. It 
also wants the Ministry of Public Works and the portfolios of 
deputy ministers of interior and finance. The government has 
already rejected this. UNITA has raised obstacles regarding the 
reinstatement of territorial administration. The two 
delegations agreed to deal with the issue tomorrow. 
  Also being discussedf is the return of buildings owned by 
the 
two sides. The government and UNITA have agreed to return each 
other's buildings. The future of the Voice of Resistance of the 
Black Cockerel [Vorgan] is also being discussed, namely when 
will it stop being partisan. The government says Vorgan cannot 
continue broadcasting on short wave because it is against the 
law. UNITA says it is necessary that Vorgan continues on the 
air, but it says it will look into the matter.

  [Text] The Angolan peace talks which began in 1993 have a 
happy end in sight. The National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] and the Luanda government are 
already discussing the dossier on national reconciliation. 
UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim, who is the 
UNITA negotiating team's spokesman, said yesterday that they are 
optimistic and will score positive results. Agreement has 
already been reached on 12 of the 18 points under discussion, 
and the two sides do not differ very much on the remaining six 
points. Dr. Valentim said the present moment is crucial and he 
favored a power-sharing pattern similar to the one in South 
Africa recently adopted by President Nelson Mandela. Sources 
close to the talks say the two sides will today discuss the 
Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel's role in the national 
reconciliation context, the role of UNITA deputies in the 
Assembly of the Republic, the return of UNITA's property, and 
the reinstatement of the state administration, besides other 
collateral issues.

of campaign activity to the commission, and warned that those 
who continued to campaign or to impersonate other parties are

evening. 
  It has been necessary for me to appeal once again for peace

certain people are intimidating others so that they should be 
scared to go to vote.

waiting for. Malawians will be going to vote for members of 
Parliament and for the president who shall govern this country 
for the next five years. Once again, let me remind all of you 
that voting in any election is not an acquired privilege but a 
valuable and an essential human right. I urge you all to 
exercise that right. You must therefore come out in large 
numbers to vote. Your vote is very important because it can 
make a difference on how this country will be governed in the 
next five years. 
  We have eight different political parties that are 
contesting 
in this election. Leaders of four of these parties are 
contesting the presidency. No doubt most of you have already 
decided on the parliamentary and presidential candidate that you 
are going to vote for. In a democratic process of this nature, 
there have to be both losers and winners in the end. You must 
remember that regardless of the outcome of the polling for your 
party we are all Malawians and must work together for a better 
Malawi after the elections. It will be a matter of great pride 
for us all if we can emerge from this election with that spirit. 
In fact, we can all be considered winners if we can achieve 
such a peaceful and constructive objective after 17th May, 
because many such elections everywhere have ended up in 
disasters. 
  I therefore want to thank you for having maintained peace 
and 
calm during the campaign period. I want to ask you to remain 
peaceful and calm during the voting process tomorrow. No one 
should intimidate members of other political parties; everyone 
who registered should be left free to vote for parliamentary and 
presidential candidates of their choice. 
  The police and the Army will ensure that there is no 
breakdown of law and order to allow free and fair voting 
tomorrow. Please make sure that everyone, especially women, are 
protected and not intimidated by anyone. 
  I appeal to all Malawians to prove to the world through this 
election that we are politically mature and that we can behave 
like civilized ladies and gentlemen. We have already been 
commended for the (?peace) and efficient management of our 
(?transition) processes. Let the same international community 
now respect us for a completely nonviolent election day and for 
continuing political stability thereafter. 
  Let me thank the National Consultative Council for having 
guided this country during the transitional period. They did a 
good job under sometimes very difficult circumstances. Let me 
also thank the Electoral Commission for having taken this 
country through the necessary preparatory steps for this 
election. It was a difficult task. Finally, let me thank the 
international community for their material and technical support 
which will enable us to hold this election tomorrow. Some of 
the achievements we have made during our recent political 
development would have been difficult if not impossible without 
their support. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, this is all I have to say to you this 
evening. I wish you all a happy and memorable voting day 
tomorrow. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Parliament, meeting in Zomba today in an 
extraordinary session, adopted a new Constitution for the 
country which will provisionally come into effect on 18th of 
this month. Giving details of the bill, the minister of justice 
and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore Munlo, explained that 
the new Constitution shall come into force in two stages. It 
will first come into force provisionally for a period of one 
year from 18th of this month, in order to comply with the wishes 
expressed at the constitutional conference which was held at 
Kwacha Conference Center earlier this year. 
  Honorable Munlo said the draft Constitution therefore 
provides for the appointment of a constitution committee of 
Parliament to create the requisite machinery to oversee the 
process of national consultation for the further refinement of 
the Constitution. 
  Among the features in the new Constitution is the 
establishment of the office of the ombudsman, whose function 
shall be to check and keep watch on public offices and public 
bodies in the performance of their duties. It also provides for 
the human rights commission, whose function will be to look at 
human rights abuses. 
  Honorable Munlo said the new Constitution also abolishes the 
present three regional traditional courts and the national 
traditional court. Several members, while supporting the bill, 
however expressed reservations on certain aspects of the 
Constitution, but noted satisfaction that there is provision for 
the (?refinement) of the new Constitution for a period of one 
year.

<F P=106> [From the "Network Africa" program] </F>
  [Text] In Malawi the consensus seems to be that the 
election campaigns have gone off without conflict, but concern 
has been expressed over allegations of voter intimidation 
involving the traditional Nyau groups in the rural areas. From 
Malawi Andrew Meldrum reports: 
  Those drum beats and war cries are the trademark signs of 
Malawi's much feared Nyau dancers. The Nyau dancers have become 
a controversial element of Malawi's election campaign. There 
are charges that the dancers have been intimidating rural people 
from attending opposition rallies and from registering to vote. 
The numerous Nyau societies costly guard their secrecy and it 
is taboo for the dancers to be seen without a mask completely 
covering their faces. Some Nyau masks are covered with 
feathers, others are of large grimacing faces. 
  For the past 20 years Malawi President Hastings Kamuzu Banda 
and his Malawi Congress Party [MCP] have used many Nyau dancers 
for their political purposes. The Nyau would force villagers to 
attend a congress party rally, for instance, or would attack a 
rural person who had been criticizing the ruling party. 
  Now there are many complaints that the Nyau dancers have 
been 
intimidating rural voters in Malawi's election campaign. 
Charles Joya, spokesman for the Independent Electoral 
Commission, explains why his group launched a formal complaint 
against the Nyau dancers. 
  [Begin recording] [Joya] The Nyau dancers have been used to 
disturb meetings of other political parties. It has been mainly 
confined to those districts in the central region, but in the 
past few weeks we haven't had any major problem in that area, so 
maybe the parties who were using the Nyau dancers have stopped 
using them, but that was a problem particularly about a month or 
two months ago. 
  [Meldrum] Charles Joya said incidents of Nyau intimidation 
significantly decreased after the Electoral Commission issued a 
report in April making specific allegations. Nyau dancers are 
colorful and exciting, but the Electoral Commission says the 
secret society should not be frightening or otherwise 
influencing Malawi's rural voters. [end recording] 
  Well, if there is anyone in Malawi who should have their 
finger on the policy regarding some of these allegations of 
intimidation and vote-buying it is the Reverend Aaron Longwe. 
Director of a local human rights organization, he was inspired 
to start the group in 1992 after various spells in prison, and 
after a year of operating in secret, he received government 
recognition. Well, his organization has been monitoring the 
election campaign. Andrew Meldrum asked him if these 
allegations were indeed true. 
  [Begin recording] [Longwe] These are true stories. One of 
our field officers has been to quite a number of places 
following up such cases. It is indeed true, most specially in 
the central region, where the Malawi Congress Party leadership 
have gone out with the chiefs to confiscate or to buy 
registration certificates from voters. It is indeed that the 
Nyau dancers as well have threatened or disrupted the rallies in 
many places, also in Dowa, Kasungu and Nchinji. We have also 
had cases of the Young Pioneers who have been going disguising 
themselves as MCP opposition members and disrupting other 
people's meetings. 
  [Meldrum] So, you do believe that human rights issues are 
very important in this first multiparty election that Malawi is 
having in 30 years? 
  [Longwe] Human rights is quite very important. So far, we 
have been issuing press releases condemning all these atrocious 
things that are taking place in this country. We are condemning 
the leadership both from the ruling party, as well as the 
opposition, and we have been trying to raise an awareness 
through the media, explaining to them of the importance of human 
rights. 
  [Meldrum] Do you think Malawian people, particularly in the 
rural areas, have an appreciation for human rights, and that 
they are willing to work to maintain the human rights that they 
have won? 
  [Longwe] They are very ready. We had some ladies who came 
from the rural areas, it was so encouraging to hear them express 
themselves by saying that now we have got our own freedom, and 
we shall never lose it, and we shall fight for it. 
  [Meldrum] You believe that tribalism and regionalism is a 
problem here in Malawi? 
  [Longwe] These are two main big problems. Even now in our 
campaign trails, we assume these are becoming more and more 
clearer that even the leaders themselves they are advocating 
regionalism and tribalism, which is very sad. 
  [Meldrum] Now, there are many people who say that because of 
Malawi's long history of repression, whoever wins, either the 
MCP, or the Aford [Alliance for Democracy] or UDF [United 
Democratic Front] will take on the same strong measures, the 
same repression that had been used before. Do you think the 
Malawi people will allow that, and what will your organization 
do? 
  [Longwe] So far, as a human rights organization, we have 
simply asked for a commission of inquiry, and what we want is 
simply accountability and scrutiny to the past atrocities. We 
don't want to incriminate anybody, but we simply want to address 
these issues, so that they are not repeated, through the human 
commission, which I believe, soon after the general elections 
shall be placed. We shall make sure that no one is deprived or 
is arbitrarily thrown back into prison, or that there is 
vengeance in this country. We shall make sure that we control 
the whole situation. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The High Court of Malawi today declared that the 
mounting of roadblocks at [word indistinct] public highways, as 
well as stopping and conducting searches on the travelling 
public, is unlawful. 
  The declaration was made in Blantyre by Justice Duncan 
Tambala following an application by the National Consultative 
Council [NCC] seeking a court order against government to lift 
[word indistinct] road blocks mounted by the police in the 
country. Making a submission on behalf of the NCC, Mr. Modakari 
Mushiswa said the NCC is concerned over the police mounting of 
roadblocks in many parts of the country. Mr. Mushiswa said the 
barriers are a concern because they cause difficulties to 
travellers who are required to offload their luggage for 
inspections, adding that the searches are also descriminatory in 
that they are only done to nongovernment persons. [passage

  [Text] The Electoral Commission's committee on violence has 
announced that it has investigated 50 cases involving breaches 
of electoral law. In the announcement in Lilongwe, the 
committee said 22 of the cases were reported to police for 
prosecution. It said the police, on their own, also prosecuted 
cases of a similar nature. The announcement said the cases 
involved, among other things, the disruption of campaign 
meetings, assault, intimidation, incitement, and use of abusive 
and inflammatory language. The committee said two offenders 
have already paid fines, one was still at large, and another one 
was fined and could have served a three-month prison term. The 
announcement said the rest of the cases are either in court or 
investigations are still under way. The electoral commission 
has since engaged private lawyers who are following some of the 
cases involving violence and intimidation and vote registration 
irregularities.

government that recognizes and makes our people feel that 
Mozambique is the fatherland of Mozambicans and not the [words

  [Text] Nampula Governor Alfredo Gamito today accused the 
Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] of still looking for 
trouble by trying to expand the so-called areas under its 
control, while launching frequent incursions into 
government-administered areas where it detains people, 
particularly members of the ruling Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front] Party. Gamito said this while presenting a 
provincial government report to President of the Republic 
Joaquim Chissano. 
  Gamito said Afonso Dhlakama's men have been harassing those 
they arrest. The governor said when faced with this situation, 
the agencies established under the terms of the Rome peace 
accord say the matter is the responsibility of the Mozambican 
police because those actions are carried out by people wearing 
civilian clothes, though it is known that they are Renamo 
soldiers. Gamito noted that the police lack the means to 
resolve such issues. 
  In his report, which was presented at an expanded meeting of 
the Nampula provincial government, Gamito said Renamo's 
relations with government agencies have been marked by 
arrogance, clashes, and hostilities. He said but for the 
provincial government's reconciliatory and reasonable posture, 
the forces of law and order would have already opened police 
files and initiated lawsuits. 
  Alfredo Gamito accused civil servants, workers, and vagrants 
with a criminal record of also adopting an attitude marked by 
arrogance, clashes and hostilities, and of being disrespectful. 
Turning to the advisers appointed by Renamo, Gamito said they 
also adopt the same attitude in dealing with him. The 
provincial governor said he has serious doubts whether something 
positive will be accomplished with the advisers or even if 
Renamo intends to do something in areas it claims to control. 
Gamito questioned whether Renamo's administration is not a mere 
figment of its imagination. Governor Gamito said what one finds 
in Nampula Province are military bases and the respective areas 
of influence with captive residents, most of whom are not 
originally from those areas. 
  Turning to his relations with other political parties, 
Alfredo Gamito said they are constructive and characterized by 
mutual respect, particularly with Maximo Dias' Mozambican 
Nationalist Movement, and Carlos Reis' Mozambican National Union. 
  Gazmito added: That is the type of exhausting relationship 
that we have been experiencing, but they will not be able to 
wear us down. 
  The president of the republic is apparently pleased with the 
political activities the Frelimo Party has been carrying out in 
Nampula, judging by the thousands upon thousands of people who 
welcomed him this morning. This afternoon, Chissano met with 
the Frelimo Party's Provincial Committee. 
  A well known Nampula journalist said even if Frelimo loses 
the legislative election in that province, Chissano will 
definitely win the presidential election. One will be able to 
gauge the electorate's mood during the rallies Chissano intends 
to hold in the cities of Nampula and Nacala, as well as in the 
capitals of Malema, Lalaua, and Namapa Districts. From what we 
have so far seen in the city of Nampula, Chissano's adversaries 
in the October presidential election will have to work very 
hard. His opponents have not yet started campaigning, which 
makes local analysts feel that a presidential candidate like 
Arouca is naive and ignorant of the local situation when he 
raises important issues in the press, but that does not say 
anything to potential voters who do not have money to buy food, 
let alone newspapers. 
  At this morning's meeting of the provincial government, 
Gamito gave a detailed account of the socioeconomic situation in 
the province.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Cardoso and Arnaldo Abilio: "Difficult </F>
Times"] 
  [Excerpt] The Mozambican peace process is going through 
what local observers call "difficult times." 
  On 13 May, reliable sources told MEDIAFAX that Mozambique 
Defense Armed Forces [FADM] instructors, who have already 
arrived in Boane, had gone on strike as their salaries have not 
been paid. The most recent UN Security Council resolution on 
Mozambique refers to the existence of problems regarding 
payments. 
  One of our reporters went to Boane on Saturday. Lieutenant 
Colonel Julius Raimundo, head of the FADM Boane Center, 
confirmed to us that there had been an "interruption" of work by 
the instructors, and that the issue had been referred to other 
authorities. MEDIAFAX is still investigating the issue. 
  The latest UN Security Council resolution on Mozambique is 
causing controversy. 
  Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana yesterday spoke to us about 
an issue which the government describes as strange: the 
resolution includes definite dates for concluding the process of 
confinement, demobilization, and formation of the FADM, "while 
the dates for all that are still being discussed in Maputo." 
  Hunguana said the dates mentioned in the resolution had not 
been proposed by Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance]. 
  Hunguana has also confirmed the West is "reigniting 
pressure" 
to make Joaquim Chissano accept a cabinet arrangement with 
Renamo before elections are held. 
  The minister did not disclose which countries are applying 
the strongest pressure. He only added that the pressure now 
includes the argument that Mozambique should adopt the South 
African model of a government of national unity (GNU). 
  Hunguana noted that "in South Africa the elections were the 
culmination of the liberation struggle against apartheid. One 
could say the elections marked South Africa's 25 June. 
[Mozambique's independence day]. For us that date is history." 
Hunguana reiterated that the government is opposed to the idea 
of a GNU. 
  Chissano has stated time and again that if he wins the polls 
he wants his hands free to form a government in line with the 
election results and in a manner that gives him the best 
guarantees for stability in the country. 
  Lately Renamo has been proposing a pre-election arrangement. 
  Richard Edis, British ambassador to Mozambique, has already 
told the Mozambican press that his government favors a 
pre-election solution without doing away with the elections. 
  Another British diplomat told MEDIAFAX last week that that 
was still his government's position, although it was not 
applying pressure along the lines of "either GNU or no money." 
  There is a great deal of speculation in Maputo that most of 
the pressure is coming from Portugal. 
  Asked to comment on the role being played by the Portuguese 
authorities on this issue, a reliable source told MEDIAFAX that 
in 1990, when the Rome talks between the government and Renamo 
had just started, the Portuguese Government "systematically" 
spoke about the need for a "system of pre-guarantees" because 
Renamo was "a group representing different interests." 
  The source said the "system of pre-guarantees" became 
clearly 
defined in a plan for a transitional government, the first pre- 
election arrangement proposal for the Mozambican process. 
  A government delegation that includes several of the 
negotiators of the Rome peace accord with Renamo left for Rome 
last night. They are: Ministers Guebuza, Hunguana, and Mazula, 
Ambassador Francisco Madeira, and a military man linked to the 
formation of the FADM. 
  Teodato Hunguana told us that the visit to Rome was not 
because there was a new government in Italy, but because of the 
"importance of relations we have with Italy." [passage omitted]

  [Text] The government has authorized opening another two 
radio stations, raising to four the total of radio stations 
already licensed. They are all based in Maputo. A source from 
the Information Ministry told Radio Mozambique that the two last 
authorized stations are: RTK [Klint Radio and Television] 
belonging to businessman Carlos Klint and Radio Projeccao owned 
by businessman Jose Custodio. 
  Earlier, two other radio stations had been authorized to 
operate. One is Radio Miramar which, according to sources 
contacted by our correspondent, is thought to be linked to the 
Kingdom of God Universal Church. The other station is Radio FM 
headed by journalist Suleiman Cabir. The Information Ministry 
source added that two other applications may soon be authorized. 
One is for Radio Encontro, which will be operated by the 
Nampula Archdiocese, and the other is Coop Radio, to be operated 
by a firm that will have Coop Imagem and the Golo advertising 
company as shareholders. Well known journalists and radio 
professionals such as Leite de Vasconcelos, Carlos Silva, and 
Antonio Fonseca are linked to this project. 
  An application to open a radio station by the Machava Sacred 
Family Parish in the outskirts of Maputo may also be authorized 
soon. Our correspondent reports that a group of youths from 
Nampula, headed by Carlitos Jafar has also applied for the 
opening of yet another television station.

  [Text] Harare May 15 SAPA -- Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU 
[Zimbabwe African National Union] (PF [Patriotic Front]) on 
Sunday held a warm-up rally to the 1995 general elections 
campaign and sent out an impassioned plea to the electorate to 
register as voters during the current exercise which ends on 
June 4. 
  The ZIANA news agency reports speakers also unleashed 
vitriolic attacks on minority parties, which in their own 
on-going 1995 election campaigns are lashing out at ZANU(PF) for 
what they call mismanagement of the economy. 
  The rally, which was the first of the meetings to be 
convened 
by the ruling party's Harare Province as a build-up to the 1995 
elections, drew a crowd of more than 5,000 from five Mbare 
Districts. Supporters from nearby Sunningdale also turned up. 
  The only damper to what had promised to be a thrilling 
marathon rally was the absence of the main speaker, the 
flamboyant ZANU(PF) Harare Provincial Chairman Herbert 
Ushewokunze. Party Provincial Secretary Tony Gara said Mr 
Ushewokunze's vehicle had broken down at Shangaani, 100km from 
Bulawayo, on Sunday morning while he was on his way to the rally.

  [Excerpts] One of the cornerstones in the building of 
democracy and promotion of our country's social and economic 
development was laid this morning: The Economic and Social 
Council [ECOSOC] was installed at the Great Hall of the 
Presidency of the Republic by the head of state, President 
Nicephore Soglo. The ceremony establishes a key institution 
that Beninese waited a long time for. It was attended by former 
ECOSOC presidents, members of the National Assembly, members of 
the Constitutional Court, cabinet members, members of the 
Supreme Court, diplomats, and international organizations. 
  Since the National Assembly, this is the fourth link in the 
chain of state institutions to be established after the swearing 
in of the president of the Republic, the inauguration of our 
National Assembly, and the installation of the Constitutional 
Court. The institution has 30 members including three from the 
Presidency of the Republic and two from the National Assembly. 
The 25 others are drawn from employers' organizations, labor 
unions, development associations, craftsmen's organizations, 
performing artists, sports federations, liberal professions, 
research organizations, and clerics. It is clear that all 
sections of the nation are represented. However, ECOSOC has 
only one female member. [passage omitted] 
  ECOSOC gives its opinion on social and economic bills, 
ordinances, or decrees as well as on other bills duly submitted 
to it. Bills of an economic or social character must be 
submitted to ECOSOC for its opinion. This institution may also, 
on its own initiative and in the form of recommendations, bring 
to the attention of the legislature or the executive on economic 
and social reforms it considers in the general interest.

  [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] has 
expressed serious concern that while Liberians are trying to 
unify their country, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], mainly the Nigerian 
contingent, is doing all it can to break the chain of unity 
among the Liberian people. Speaking at a technical committee 
meeting yesterday involving the NPFL, UNOMIL [United Nations 
Observer Mission in Liberia], and ECOMOG in Konala, Margibi 
County, the coordinator general of the NPFL, Major General 
Austin Clark, said the continuous issuance of passes for 
Liberians to travel to and from Monrovia means further dividing 
the Liberian nation and people. 
  Gen. Clark questioned from whence ECOMOG received its 
mandate 
to stop Liberians from travelling freely on the Monrovia-Kakata 
high street. At the same time, another member of the NPFL 
delegation at yesterday's meeting, Major General Charles Wright 
has made it clear that no Liberian citizen will again go to 
ECOMOG for so-called travelling passes before driving or riding 
through his motherland.

  [Text] A tense standoff is developing between Charles 
Taylor's NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] faction and 
the Armed Forces of Liberia [AFL]. Yesterday, AFL Commander 
Lieutenant General Bowen issued a stern warning to Taylor's men 
about problems in Harbel, the site of the giant Firestone rubber 
plantation, and now ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] have taken action to try to 
stop things getting worse, as Nii Nartey Allison reports in this 
telex from Monrovia. 
  Two truckloads of African peacekeeping troops moved into 
Harbel today to stave off war between the AFL and Charles 
Taylor's NPFL. A spokesman for the African peacekeeping forces 
said that the deployment in Harbel was a preventative and 
precautionary measure. He called on Harbel residents to remain 
calm as the situation was fully under control. 
  The chief of the AFL, Lt. Gen. Hezekiah Bowen, yesterday 
threatened to wage war against the NPFL if it did not withdraw 
from AFL positions in the Harbel area. However, the NPFL 
liaison officer in Monrovia, John Richardson, today dismissed 
Bowen's threats as no threat to the NPFL but rather a threat to 
the peace process and the Liberian people. He said Bowen should 
take his case to the cease-fire violation committee set up and 
provided for under the Cotonou peace accord. 
  Meanwhile, a Russian vessel, the M.V. Volotitsa, has been 
detained here at the free port of Monrovia for illegal entry and 
bringing in 81 aliens. A Justice Ministry statement said 11 
immigration officers assigned to the free port have been charged 
with negligence of duty. The ministry said the ship arrived 
here two weeks ago and unloaded 81 aliens believed to be 
mercenaries. They disembarked and disappeared before immigration 
officers at the port knew what had happened. Neither the 
nationalities of the aliens nor its last port of call have been 
revealed. 
  ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] 
leader Roosevelt Johnson accused Alhaji Koromah and his Mandingo 
supporters of hiring the mercenaries to help fight his Krahn 
faction. Koromah dismissed the Johnson claim as baseless, 
untrue, and mere fabrication designed to cause confusion.

  [Text] Niamey, 17 May (AFP) -- The 40,000 Niger civil 
servants today resumed their strike, which will last four days 
this time, in order to obtain a 30- to 50-percent salary 
increase to compensate for the reduction in their purchasing 
power following the CFA franc devaluation. 
  The workers are also demanding the abrogation of a law 
adopted by the National Assembly regulating the right to strike. 
Civil servants have already launched two strikes, from 12 to 14 
April, and from 10 to 12 May for the same reasons. On 16 April, 
government authorities decided on a 5- to 12-percent increase, 
adding that they would not offer any more. 
  "Workers are determined to multiply strikes to obtain 
complete satisfaction for their demands," Ibrahim Mayaki, the 
secretary general of the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger. 
  Despite troubles due to sporadic power cuts, banks and 
business were operating normally this morning in Niamey and 
airport traffic was normal.

  [Text] Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea today in Abuja held 
talks on ways of improving relations between them. The head of 
state, General Sani Abacha, led Nigeria's team while President 
Nguema Mbasogo was at the head of his country's delegation. 
  Declaring the talks open, Gen. Abacha said his 
administration 
was committed to efforts aimed at improving relations between 
the two countries. The head of state described President 
Mbasogo's visit as a reaffirmation of long-standing brotherly 
ties between Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea. 
  Responding, President Mbasogo said his country was always 
interested in developments in Nigeria because of the unique role 
which his country expected Nigeria to play in the continent. He 
said that Nigeria and the new democratic South Africa should 
exploit their huge natural and material resources to ensure that 
Africa assumed its rightful position in the world. 
  [Lagos NTA Television Network in English at 2000 GMT on 17 
May adds the following: "Nigeria has been described as a nation 
which has the capacity to check external forces said to be 
threatening peace and stability in Africa. Equatorial Guinean 
President General Nguema Mbasogo made this statement today at 
the plenary session of bilateral talks between Nigeria and 
Equatorial Guinea held in Abuja."]

  [Text] There has been a government reshuffle in Chad today: 
nine ministers out of 16 are leaving the cabinet, while civil 
servants are still on strike. Dieudonne Djonabaye reports: 
  [Begin Djonabaye recording] Nine ministers have left Kassire 
Coumakoye's new government, the most important of which is 
General Kamougue Wadal Abdelkader, who held the civil service 
portfolio and represented the government side in talks with the 
civil servants who have been on strike for three weeks. He has 
been replaced in this post by Mr. Salibou Garba, who is also the 
leader of an opposition party [National Alliance for Democracy 
and Progress], but who certainly will have his hands tied in the 
negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact. 
  The other departure is that of Mr. Ibni Oumar Mahamat Saleh, 
of the department of planning and cooperation. Mr. Ibni Oumar 
Mahamat Saleh's chair goes to Mrs. Mariam Mamadnou, who was 
secretary of state in the same department in 1990. 
  The make-up of this new government is inauspicious as far as 
the negotiations with the trades unions over the social pact are 
concerned. The departure of Kamougue and of Ibni Oumar Mamahat 
Saleh, regarded by the unions as moderates, will be a heavy blow 
to the negotiations which have been held up for five days over 
the thorny question of the application of the decree regulating 
strikes. This is Dieudonne Djonabaye in Ndjamena for RFI [end 
recording] 
  It should also be noted that the son of Chad's first 
president, President Tombalbaye, has entered the cabinet.

<F P=106> [By Michel Cariou] </F>
  [Text] Libreville, May 17 (AFP) -- About 50 would-be 
illegal immigrants drowned overnight in a shipwreck off the 
Gabonese coast near Cape Esterias as they sought to make their 
way into the country, police said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Paramilitary police and firemen went Tuesday to rescue 
survivors from the disaster, who were thought to be of West 
African origin, but the precise number and nationalities of the 
victims was not clear. 
  Early in February, 67 illegal immigrants, mainly Ghanaians 
and Nigerians, died in their crowded cell at a paramilitary 
police base in Libreville, sparking an international protest and 
a Gabonese government enquiry. 
  People from other West African countries are attracted by 
the 
relative prosperity of Gabon, which until last year had the 
highest income per head in the region. The minimum wage is 
still higher than in other countries. 
  For clandestine travellers, the sea trip is the most 
perilous 
part of the journey. They travel in pirogues, generally owned 
by Nigerians, which can carry up to 80 people. The voyage from 
Nigeria to Gabon takes five or six days, with port calls in 
Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea, where the ferrymen engage in 
more or less shady trading activities. 
  It is not uncommon for the boats to be caught in storms and 
shipwrecks are frequent in the Gulf of Guinea. 
  Already weakened by the journey and by the lack of food, 
according to some survivors, the hopeful immigrants sometimes 
find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous smugglers. 
  One oft-used trick is deliberately to ground the pirogue on 
a 
bank not far offshore, where the ferrymen rob their charges of 
their luggage. Some of the passengers are themselves smugglers, 
carrying objects of value. 
  Over the years, the growth of illegal immigration and 
smuggling has led to the founding of illegal ports, tucked away 
on isolated shores or islands, particularly in Equatorial Guinea.

  [Text] Forty-four West African illegal immigrants who 
attempted to enter Gabon are reported missing after their boat 
sunk near Libreville. According to the latest casualty figures 
released today by the Gabonese Ministry of Defense, Security, 
and Immigration, 14 men reached the shore and nine, including 
eight Malians and one Nigerian, were rescued by the fire brigade 
and then picked up by gendarmes. The other five managed to 
escape. The boat coming from Nigeria sank on 15 May as it 
entered the Gabon estuary at a spot where the current is 
particularly strong and at a time when the sea was rough.

  [Text] The RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] now controls the 
entire Rwanda borders with Tanzania and Uganda and a big part of 
the Rwanda border with Burundi. The RPF controls the Rwandan 
side of Rusumo bridge between Rwanda and Tanzania. The fears 
that Rusumo bridge may be destroyed are not founded. The bridge 
is not contested. It is under the total control of the RPF. 
The RPF does not expect any invasion from Tanzania. The 
youthwingers who fled to Tanzania, most of them dumped their 
weapons to the Rwandan side of the border and those who crossed 
with their arms have been disarmed by Tanzanian authorities. 
Some known killers have even been arrested by Tanzanian 
authorities. It is in the interest of the RPF that the Rusumo 
bridge remains safe.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council has passed a resolution 
allowing for the deployment of 5,500 UN troops to Rwanda. One 
hundred and fifty UN monitors will be sent to Rwanda immediately 
and 500 Ghanaian troops, who had been withdrawn from Rwanda, 
will be sent back. No country so far has confirmed readiness 
for contribution to the troops to be sent to Rwanda. [passage 
omitted] 
  Concerning the resolution of sending 5,500 UN troops to 
Rwanda, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has given a statement 
saying that it would not be bound by the resolution, if the 
government in Rwanda participated in passing the resolution. 
The RPF has also called for the withdrawal of the UN special 
representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, before 
the RPF can approve the deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda. 
Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh has been closely associated with 
the dictatorship in Rwanda, to the extent that he has helped to 
install the current illegitimate government in Rwanda. The RPF 
has accepted the principle of deploying a UN force to Rwanda 
with a humanitarian mission, with a reasonable number of troops, 
about 2,500 troops.

  [Text] In a message to the local and international 
community published on 16 May 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front 
[RPF] chairman, Colonel Alexis Kanyarengwe, denounced the clique 
of politicians and Army officers who have plunged the country 
into bloodshed that is unprecedented in this country. The RPF 
chairman prays for those who have lost their loved ones in this 
bloodshed and commends the efforts and sacrifices of the RPF 
youth in their endeavors to liberate our country. 
  The RPF chairman said that the Republican National Movement 
for Democracy and Development [MRND] political party, in 
conjunction with small political parties opposed to the Arusha 
peace agreements, are responsible for the bloodshed in Rwanda. 
They killed politicians who were fighting the truth, they shed 
the blood of innocent people. These political parties ignored 
the process of setting up a government that respects the rule of 
law and ignored the respect of human rights. These political 
parties violated multiparty democracy and went against the 
spirit of ethnic tolerance. 
  The RPF chairman said that the RPF cannot accept any 
negotiations with this clique of politicians who staged a coup 
against the Arusha peace agreements. The RPF chairman said that 
negotiating a settlement with these killers would be the same as 
endorsing the atrocities that the clique has been committing. 
The RPF chairman said that the RPF has made a concession and 
agreed to talk with the Rwandan Government forces. These talks 
are being arranged and the RPF fully supports them. 
  The RPF chairman said that the UN secretary general special 
representative to Rwanda, Dr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, has been 
biased against the RPF and has also been giving false reports 
concerning the situation in Rwanda. And as such, the RPF does 
not want to have anything to do with Dr. Jacques-Roger 
Booh-Booh. The RPF chairman said that Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh 
has failed to be a mediator and has been working with the 
killers openly. Jacques- Roger Booh-Booh has been working with 
the dictatorship in Rwanda and with the Coalition for the 
Defense of the Republic political party. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh 
has also been working with the current illegitimate government 
in Rwanda which he helped to install. 
  Concerning the deployment of UN forces to Rwanda, the RPF 
chairman said that the RPF would accept in principle the 
deployment of the UN forces to Rwanda with a humanitarian 
mission. The RPF chairman said that the RPF is currently 
engaged in the following priorities: 1) to assist people who 
have survived the massacres, 2) to fight and neutralize the 
clique of Rwandan Government forces who are responsible for the 
genocide in Rwanda and to restore peace in the country, and 3) 
to call upon the international community to set up a commission 
of inquiry to investigate the massacres in Rwanda so that those 
responsible can be brought to justice. This set of priorities 
will soon be realized. The RPF has already liberated more than 
half of the country. RPF civilian cadets are now organizing the 
displaced people so as to facilitate the administration and 
distribution of humanitarian aid and to enable the people to 
return to their homes. 
  The RPF has established some administrative structures in 
areas that have been liberated, and peace and tranquillity have 
returned to these areas. People have returned to their homes 
and have started growing their crops in order to benefit from 
the current rains. The RPF chairman is therefore calling upon 
those who have been displaced to return to their homes in the 
RPF-controlled area so that they can take advantage of the rains 
to grow their crops. The RPF chairman said that even the members 
of the Interahamwe [MRND militias] who are ready to put down 
their arms and stop their barbaric acts may return to their 
homes and start normal life. 
  The RPF chairman appealed to the people of Rwanda that 
madness and barbaric acts should be replaced with sanity. 
Ethnic discrimination and ethnic supremacy should be replaced 
with the rule of law, unity, and equality among Rwandan 
citizens. The RPF chairman therefore appealed to all the 
Rwandan citizens, and particularly the members of the RPF, to 
calm down and desist from vengeance-based violence. 
  The RPF chairman said that the fundamental principles of the 
RPF have not changed. We are still committed to national unity, 
democracy, and security of persons and property. The RPF still 
supports the principles enshrined in the Arusha peace 
agreements: rule of law, respect of human rights, multiparty 
democracy, the principle of power-sharing and formation of a 
single national Army. The RPF chairman called upon the people of 
Rwanda to support the above principles because this is the only 
remedy to Rwanda's problems. All of us together shall win, said 
the chairman of the RPF, Col. Alexis Kanyarengwe.

  [Text] Rwandan refugees who had fled to Tanzania are 
returning home in large numbers following the restoration of 
peace and security in the Prefecture of Kibungo by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front [RPF]. In the last three days, the RPF near 
Rusumo has received many returnees including 86 orphans who had 
fled to Tanzania. Some returnees are accommodated in temporary 
camps for some of them have feared going back to their homes 
believing that the Republican National Movement for Democracy 
and Development [MRND] youthwingers are still operating in the 
countryside. But some returnees have been escorted to their 
homes and, after ensuring that they are safe, they have stayed 
in their homes. 
  Life is returning to normal in Prefecture Kibungo. The 
returnees are calling upon their relatives, neighbors, and 
friends who are still in refugee camps in Tanzania to take the 
first opportunity available and come home. They should ignore 
the malicious propaganda that the RPF is committing atrocities 
in Kibungo. These rumors, this propaganda is being spread by 
MRND's militia who are haunted by the massacres they have been 
carrying out. The MRND's youthwingers are spreading the rumors 
of atrocities by the RPF so as to discourage the refugees from 
returning home. For if the refugees were to return home, it 
would be easy to conduct investigations into the atrocities by 
the youthwingers and the criminals would be easily exposed. But 
the delay is not a solution. These criminals will eventually be 
charged, whether in Rwanda or in Tanzania, for they have been 
committing crimes against humanity.

  [Text] Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development [MRND]'s militias who have been operating inside the 
RPF-controlled areas in Kibungo Prefecture are now losing the 
war and have started fleeing to Tanzania. The militias have 
been killing people in the countryside and at the same time 
attacking RPF soldiers. The militias have now run short of 
supplies of food and ammunition. They have decided to flee to 
Tanzania using canoes across River Akagera, according to 
(Nyirigira Mutabaruka) of Radio Muhabura who has been touring 
Prefecture Kibungo. 
  Reports from the Tanzanian side of River Akagera tell us 
that 
thousands of people have been discovered camping in areas 
unknown to the UNHCR up to now. Most of these people could be 
the MRND's combatants who are fleeing after running short of 
food and ammunition. Most of the youthwingers who have been 
operating in Kibungo are now ordinary residents of Prefecture 
Kibungo. They were transported from Gisenyi and on reaching 
Kibungo, they went underground and started their terror campaign 
which reached a crescendo after the death of President 
Habyarimana. These youthwingers have been operating far away 
from home and cannot easily replenish their food and ammunition 
supplies given the fact that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is 
continuing its pacification of Kibungo Prefecture. The only 
option available for the youthwingers is to flee to Tanzania 
using canoes across River Akagera.

  [Text] The UN force in Rwanda is asking for planes, armored 
vehicles, and trucks to deploy the extra 5,500 UN peacekeepers 
announced by the United Nations. 
  The UN mission in Rwanda has said that a cease-fire is 
essential to put an end to the genocide against the Tutsis. Let 
me remind you that Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes 
criticized the Security Council's decision. He would have 
preferred the priority to be given to the safe areas near the 
border with Tanzania and Burundi in order to protect refugees. 
However, the United Nations' priority is to reopen Kigali 
airport to facilitate the distribution of food in the country.

  [Text] The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has rescued 2,000 
people in Bugesera in the southeastern part of Rwanda. The 
2,000 people, who had been hiding in river swamps called 
nyamwiza, are the few people who have survived the massacres 
committed by Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development [MRND]'s militias and government soldiers. The 
survivors are telling stories of horror that thousands of 
people, men, women, and children were hacked to death while many 
others were tied with their hands behind their back and thrown 
into River Nyabarongo which flows into the River Akagera. These 
bodies have been flowing into Lake Victoria causing a health 
hazard along the Akagera River course through Tanzania and 
Uganda. The RPF has now taken control of Bugesera and restored 
calm in these areas. There are no more people being thrown into 
the River Nyabarongo, for the MRND's youthwingers who have been 
committing atrocities are now on the run. The dead bodies 
flowing down Akagera River are said to be decomposing and not 
fresh corpses. This has confirmed that the killings by the MRND 
youthwingers have been greatly reduced and peace is slowly 
returning to these areas.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council decided last night to 
send 5,500 peacekeeping troops to Rwanda. [passage omitted] 
  On the ground, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the RPF, did not 
want another UN peacekeeping mission. Nevertheless it is not 
greatly worried by the mission that has been announced. Here is 
Alain de Strael, RTBF's special correspondent, in Rwanda: 
  [Begin de Strael recording] The RPF does not feel itself in 
any way bound by the different aspects of the Security Council 
resolution, and in any case, it is not worried about it. It was 
opposed to the sending of a buffer force that would compel it to 
negotiate with a government it refuses to recognize. But now 
the mission entrusted to the revamped UNAMIR [UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda] is basically a humanitarian one. 
  The victims are the result of the chaos born of the war. 
First, there are the militias, against which the UN can do 
nothing. They are continuing to kill in the villages; we saw 
this even in the zones conquered by the RPF. This is why the 
people are fleeing. 
  The second exodus is that of people fleeing the advance of 
the RPF, which is preceded with a reputation for massacring 
civilians - a completely unjustified reputation, as we also 
discovered on the spot, but one which is carefully fostered by 
government propaganda. 
  So no UN resolution will change a thing on the ground: the 
only solution that might perhaps win through in the end is for 
the Rwandan Army, from a position of military weakness, to break 
ranks with the government, and to negotiate. That is what the 
RPF is expecting. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] The entire Bugesera region is now in the hands of 
the Rwandan Patriotic Front. However, before it came under the 
control of the Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA], the government 
Army, backed by Interahamwe Republican National Movement for 
Democracy and Development [MRND] militias had taken care to 
exterminate the whole population of the region, especially 
members of the Tutsi ethnic group as is the case in other areas 
under their control. Several communal graves, which were 
carefully prepared in advance, have been discovered by RPF 
combatants. The natural (?cave) of (Vayanga) also contained a 
large number of corpses which were thrown there by men of the 
current government. 
  And it is sad that neither French President Francois 
Mitterrand, nor UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, nor 
his staff member Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh on a mission in our 
country for Rwandans' sins, none of these three men [word 
indistinct] makes any comment on this sheer horror. On the 
contrary, the first one armed and trained the neo-Nazi killers 
who have just committed an irreparable act; the second, through 
the third one, withdrew UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] 
forces which were protecting the unfortunate people, giving the 
barbarous militias the freedom to kill. None of these three men 
cares about the crimes which the militias of the current 
government and the soldiers continue to perpetrate. 
  You have no doubt listened to the words of Mr. Theodore 
Sindikubwabo, puppet president of Rwanda, a statement which he 
made yesterday in Kibuye where he was on a visit to express 
satisfaction over the genocide which has just been committed in 
that prefecture. He thanked the killers before indicating that 
the troubles had ended because the people to be killed had 
indeed all been killed. 
  Mr. Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh is in Rwanda and does not say a 
single word about these government crimes. On the contrary, the 
government is encouraged by the UN secretary general's 
representative and by French President Francois Mitterrand who 
is trying desperately to have this government recognized. This 
government is in a shaky state after having committed genocide 
unprecedented on this earth.

  [Excerpts] Nairobi, 18 May (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels have 
turned their attention away from the capital Kigali and are 
advancing toward a town to the southwest where the government 
fled last month, United Nations officials said Wednesday [18 
May]. Sporadic mortar blasts and small arms fire rocked the 
blood-sodden capital Wednesday as guerrillas of the rebel Rwanda 
Patriotic Front (RPF) fought government soldiers. But it was 
"relatively quiet" compared to recent fierce artillery battles, 
said Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance 
Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). "Taking Kigali is not for the time 
being the RPF's number one objective," Kabia told AFP by 
telephone from Kigali. 
  Heavy fighting raged in the northwestern town of Ruhengeri 
where the Army is holding out against a rebel onslaught, and 
south of Kigali where the RPF have cut off the government from 
the capital. The rebels have seized control of a stretch of road 
between Kigali and Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) to the 
southwest, where the interim government fled as ethnic killings 
and fighting between government and rebel forces engulfed the 
capital, Kabia said. His report, however, was denied by an Army 
spokesman who said government forces controlled the road between 
Gitarama and Kigali. [passage omitted] 
  The rebels have sealed off the capital on three sides. They 
are trying to sever Army supply lines and isolate the government 
from its forces and possibly force them to flee a second time, 
UN military sources said.

  [Text] Johannesburg May 18 SAPA -- Political exiles who 
returned to South Africa under temporary indemnity from 
prosecution have had their period of indemnity extended to May 
17, 1995. The announcement in a Government Gazette this week 
has nothing to do with the possible amnesty for political 
offenders mentioned by president Nelson Mandela in his 
inauguration speech on Tuesday last week. 
  Exiles who committed politically-motivated crimes before 
October 8, 1990 were granted temporary indemnity from 
prosecution for a one-year period and this has been extended 
every year by a year at a time. 
  The provision is understood to embrace cabinet ministers, 
among them Housing Minister Joe Slovo who is a former chief of 
staff of the African National Congress' armed Wing Umkhonto We 
Sizwe [Spear of the Nation], and Umkhonto commander and now 
Defence Minister Joe Modise. 
  As the indemnity act of 1990 now stands, people who 
committed 
offences before October 8, 1990 may apply for indemnity from 
prosecution for politically-motivated offences. The 
constitution provides for this cut-off date to be extended until 
December 6, 1993. Mr Mandela has indicated that the cabinet 
will soon take a final decision on the matter.

  [Text] Umtata May 17 SAPA -- The chief of the South African 
Air Force, Lt-Gen James Kriel, assured members of the former 
Transkei Defence Force on Tuesday that their jobs would be safe 
in the new South African National Defence Force. Speaking after 
meeting with members of the former Transkei Defence Force Gen 
Kriel said the integration of the airwings of the former 
homeland armies would not pose a problem. "People should not 
fear that they will lose their jobs and benefits because of this 
new setup. There will be no discrimination on the colour of the 
skin", Gen Kriel said. 
  The Umtata airwing will close at the end of May and its 
aircraft will be transferred to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free 
State.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  THE STAR </H8>
  Human Development Viewed -- Johannesburg THE STAR in English 
considers South Africa's ranking in the UN Human Development 
Index in its editorial on page 10 on 18 May. It notes that the 
index, which is an indication of the quality of life within a 
country, ranks South Africa "alongside such shining examples as 
Libya and Lebanon." Noting some regions of particular concern, 
the editorial concludes: "The new Government is obviously more 
people-oriented than its predecessors and its Ministers have not 
wasted any time in calling for, among other things, bold housing 
initiatives and the need to ensure access to clean water for 
all. These are some of the fundamentals that will lift this 
country above the Third World quagmire. The balancing act is 
going to be a challenge." 
<H8>  SOWETAN </H8>
  Praise for Police -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in 
editorial on page 10 of its 18 May issue notes that "radical 
rightwing elements have been dealt a series of blows which have 
taken a lot of wind out of their sails." The potential for 
violence by the right wing is diminishing. The editorial 
credits the police: "The police have done a sterling job, 
especially against radical rightwing groups. Their swift action 
has thwarted other possible bomb attacks....We can do no more 
than praise the police for acting so fast and decisively against 
terrorism."

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The government and National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola [UNITA] negotiating teams are still 
discussing national reconciliation. Today, the government and 
UNITA spent the whole day discussing the future of the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan]. The government wants 
Vorgan to operate as a commercial radio station and stop 
broadcasting on medium wave because it violates the law. UNITA 
accepts this, but says for historic reasons the transformation 
of Vorgan into a commercial station must be gradual. The two 
delegations will continue discussing the issue tomorrow. 
  Although the talks have not yet discussed a new mandate for 
the UN Angola Verification Mission, the United Nations has 
already invited a number of countries to monitor the peace 
process once an accord is signed in Lusaka. Jack Mabanga, 
Zambia's secretary of state for defense, told today's edition of 
the Zambian DAILY MAIL that Zambia is one of these countries.

  [Text] The National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola [UNITA] and the government continue to make progress in 
the delicate dossier on national reconciliation. Yesterday, the 
parties were able to agree on two of the five points left to be 
discussed under national reconciliation. They deal with the 
reinstatement of territorial administration and the return of 
buildings owned by both sides. Today, the parties are 
discussing another point -- social communications -- 
particularly the future of the opposition radio, the Voice of 
Resistance of the Black Cockerel. Thus, only two points remain 
to be discussed -- the role of UNITA deputies and UNITA's 
participation in the country's government both at central and 
local levels. 
  Asked to comment on the talks today, UNITA Information 
Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim said peace for Angola is something 
that must be achieved at all cost.

throughout Cabinda Province. 
  [Begin recording] [Pedro] The issue of Cabinda is delicate. 
There are two forms of resolving the issue. One is military and 
the other one is political. The political solution is the best. 
Thus, we have been doing all we can to assist the government to 
find a peaceful solution to the problem of Cabinda. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Commander, soldiers in the field say 
they are waiting for orders to enter Necuto. When will they 
receive that order? 
  [Pedro] Well, it does not mean that we do not have enough 
force to enter Necuto. When the time is ripe and conditions 
have been created, we shall go to Necuto to reinstate state 
administration there. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Council of Ministers' Secretariat </F>
in Luanda on 16 May] 
  [Text] It was with astonishment that the Council of 
Ministers' Secretariat of the Republic of Angola learned about a 
recent report circulated by a Spanish daily EL PAIS. The report 
says the former director of the Spanish Civil Defense [Guarda 
Civil], accused of corruption and evasion of justice, personally 
promoted and participated in an arms sale operation to Angola 
between the end of 1992 and beginning of 1993. The report also 
says Angolan leaders were involved in this alleged arms traffic. 
  The Council of Ministers' Secretariat of the Republic of 
Angola categorically rejects the manner in which the report has 
been circulated, since relations between Angola and Spain have 
always been at the level of sovereign states, based on the 
existing cooperative relations. The communique says at no time 
has the Angolan Government established relations with Spanish 
private entities or individuals. 
  The Council of Ministers' Secretariat can only conclude that 
the report is simply aimed at making an abusive link between an 
individual on the run from justice and a legitimate government 
that has nothing to do with the internal affairs of other 
countries, no matter how good the relations between them.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers met today to examine 
economic issues, within the framework of the economic and social 
program. The meeting, chaired by President of the Republic Jose 
Eduardo dos Santos, approved all examined documents on economic 
issues. 
  The documents, which were approved with amendments, include 
the revision of economic legislation, which is viewed as a 
priority in the readjustment of the government's economic 
program. The Council of Ministers also examined the law on 
foreign investment, which aims at creating incentives to attract 
foreign capital. It also examined the privatization law and the 
public investment program. What does the government intend to 
achieve with all these documents, which are to be submitted to 
the National Assembly? Sabino Ferraz, Council of Ministers 
deputy secretary explains: 
  [Begin recording] [Ferraz] The government intends to achieve 
different objectives depending on the law in question. For 
example, the law on public and private sectors is aimed at 
broadening participation of the private sector in the national 
economic activity. The law on foreign investment is aimed at 
improving the foreign investment code to attract foreign capital 
to Angola. The law on privatization is aimed at increasing 
private investment in national economic activity. It is also 
aimed at increasing the participation of private agents in 
economic activity, thus reducing state participation. It is 
therefore important to note that all legal privatization carried 
out so far will be respected. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are these incentives valid during 
this period of war or after the war? 
  [Ferraz] Well, we have to think about the present moment, 
the 
present situation of war we are experiencing. After the war, we 
can think about other kinds of incentives. The draft law takes 
this into account. [end recording]

  [Text] The proceedings of the first augmented consultative 
council of the Rapid Intervention Police [RIP] ended in Luanda 
yesterday. During the three-day meeting, participants examined 
ways to improve the RIP's organizational and operational system. 
The participants also examined [words indistinct], corruption 
and self-image. 
  At the end of the meeting, the participants expressed 
concern 
over the operational situation because of the large-scale 
actions carried out by the enemy against RIP's positions, 
localities, and strategic targets; and the increasing crime rate 
in the main cities, particularly Luanda. Deputy Police 
Commissioner Bartolomeu Kifofo said the RIP's work is 
commendable, despite some difficulties faced. 
  [Begin Kifofo recording] We know it is not easy to work 
under 
the present conditions. We do not, however, have another way 
out, dear comrades. Over the past two years, we have been able 
to overcome major difficulties. Today, we can say with pride 
that, despite some failures because of lack of material 
conditions, we have on the whole fulfilled our mission. [end

  [Text] Our guest today is Albert Zafy, the president of 
Madagascar, who is making his first official visit to France 
since coming to power last year. Thierry Perret asked him 
first, of course, about the climate between Madagascar and 
France today after certain somewhat rocky periods: 
  [Begin recording] [Zafy] I think that our visit to France is 
already proof that relations between Madagascar and France are 
good, and are in the process of normalizing. It has been said 
that there have perhaps been shadows with the behavior of 
certain people, and I think this should not cast a shadow of any 
kind over relations between Madagascar and France. 
  [Perret] It seems that France and organizations like the IMF 
are on the same wavelength -- that's to say that Madagascar is 
being blamed for taking too long over economic reform, over 
opening up economically. How do you react to these accusations? 
  [Zafy] I think the World Bank and the IMF have been 
reproaching us for a long time, each time we hold discussions, 
for not having coherent programs. At one time, perhaps, this 
was more or less true. But having given mature reflection to 
the reports drawn up by the World Bank and IMF and the report 
drawn up by our own Malagasy technical experts, I think the 
disagreement lies rather over how we have determined priorities. 
  Our technical experts, with the help of the heads of 
institutions, see that such and such are the priorities for 
Madagascar. Evidently the Bretton Woods institutions see this 
differently, especially in the macroeconomic framework. For 
example, putting the civil service house in order, freezing jobs 
in the civil service, freezing salaries, and then really pushing 
the liberalization of the economy. Then there are certain 
measures on the Malagasy front: You know that this entails 
great difficulties, and also difficulties than could lead to 
social unrest if we apply them wholesale, without distinction. 
  [Perret] Isn't there disagreement on the internal front too? 
Isn't there some difficulty about getting together a majority in 
the National Assembly on political questions? Does that not 
slow down business? And in the long run is that not a threat to 
democracy in Madagascar, this political situation where the 
Assembly is badly split? 
  [Zafy] As far as the Assembly goes, I don't think that the 
absence of a coherent majority could threaten our democracy. 
All the deputies in the Assembly are, for the most part -- 
except for a few individuals -- people who have fought for the 
creation of this democracy, and I really don't see how such 
people could work to ensure that this democracy should fail. 
  [Perret] But how can you have your hands free to conduct 
policy? That is perhaps the difficulty today. 
  [Zafy] You cannot really talk today about who is really an 
opposition, as you can in the French Assembly. You cannot talk 
about an opposition. There is perhaps a group, with more or 
less divergent views, on certain questions at least, which, in 
my opinion, are not yet fundamental questions. 
  Obviously, depending on the circumstances, it is quite 
fluid. 
It is not yet a systematic opposition to counter such and such 
a group, I think. We don't have that yet. 
  [Perret] Some observers are wondering whether the prime 
minister will be able to continue his work, will continue to be 
supported. 
  [Zafy] At the moment, I think, the prime minister is not in 
danger with his government, because there are certainly also 
people who want jobs within the government. These people, 
obviously, will perhaps continue to make trouble right and left 
until they get their own people into the government. I don't 
think that this is a serious or real threat to the government at 
the moment. 
  Anyway, it was the National Assembly that passed the 
government's program by an overwhelming majority. And then, 
this government has not been at work for a year -- since 
September-October -- and you also know all the difficulties it 
has to cope with. There have been various elections, the work 
it has buckled down to, and I think you don't have to be too 
severe [sentence as heard]. [end recording]

  [Text] A report from Malawi says voters are turning out in 
their thousands to cast their ballots in [words indistinct] 
election. Reports from around the country say that despite the 
wintry cold weather, long queues had formed at most polling 
booths before they opened, and that the crowds were generally in 
a good mood. There were no reports of violence but President 
Banda said in a radio broadcast this morning that he had heard 
there had been shooting in the southern district of Nsanje. He 
gave no details and police would not comment. There have also 
been some reports of violations of the electoral code. A 
spokesman for the Independent Electoral Commission said it was 
requesting that action be taken against the culprits immediately 
in the interests of free and fair elections, if it was found 
that the election law had been violated.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with South African Ambassador in </F>
Malawi, Llewellyn Crewe-Brown, by announcer John Bishop; date 
not given, from the "Agenda" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Bishop] A short time ago we made telephonic contact 
with South Africa's Ambassador to Malawi, Mr. Llewellyn 
Crewe-Brown, and I first asked him how the day had been so far. 
  [Crewe-Brown] It has been a very busy day, but a very 
interesting day in the history of Malawi. 
  [Bishop] More than ambassador today, I believe you are 
assisting in some way with the election? 
  [Crewe-Brown] Today I'm also an international observer. The 
Malawi Government asked for international observers to come to 
Malawi, and with a number of countries present, some of the 
embassy staff people are also acting as international observers, 
and I'm one of them. 
  [Bishop] What has been your observation so far? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I've been out in the rural areas of Lilongwe 
and it's been very clear that the elections are being held under 
strict supervision of the local parties, and I could say really 
so far, they have been free and fair. I've been very impressed 
with the quality of the elections so far. 
  [Bishop] Violence free? No violence? 
  [Crewe-Brown] It's been exceptionally violence free, both 
before the elections and on election day. We are very grateful 
for that. I think the Malawian Government was worried about 
this problem, but it certainly hasn't raised its head anywhere 
here in Malawi. 
  [Bishop] Now analysts are saying that it looks as if it's 
the 
end of the Hastings Banda era. Would you stick your neck out 
and comment? 
  [Crewe-Brown] Well, of course it's very difficult at this 
stage to say, but I think anyone has a chance, but I think that 
speculation here is that the United Democratic Front, under the 
leadership of Mr. Bikili Maluzi, has a very good chance of 
winning these elections. I personally think it's going to be 
quite a close a race between the Malawi Congress Party and the 
United Democratic Front, with the AFORD [Alliance for Democracy] 
Party in the third place. 
  [Bishop] If you had to prepare a report for South African 
Foreign Affairs, what are you likely to put in that report? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I would say that the very good relations that 
have existed between South Africa and Malawi will continue in 
the future because I think all the political parties in Malawi 
realize the importance of South Africa. And I don't think that 
any of the parties really wish to break off their relations with 
our country. In fact, I think with a new government in South 
Africa it will be easier for Malawi to maintain its relations 
with South Africa. 
  [Bishop] Well, Malawians rather like South Africans have a 
new constitution. How much difference will that make to the 
Malawians in the future? 
  [Crewe-Brown] A new government to Malawi is going to make it 
more acceptable in the international community. Last year they 
had many problems with donor communities who didn't want to give 
their aid any more because they felt that Malawi is neglecting 
the democratic rights of so many people. But I think with this 
whole process on the go now -- and the world will see that it 
was free and fair -- they will be prepared to give them the 
international aid that they require, and I think the relations 
of Malawi will improve certainly with its neighboring countries 
like Zambia and Tanzania. 
  [Bishop] Now, presuming that Dr. Banda loses the election, 
can you see peace after that, do you think there might be 
recriminations against his former regime? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I think we must remember that during the 
referendum last year, when the people voted for multiparty 
democracy, President Banda accepted it immediately without any 
reserves and I don't think that even if he did happen to lose 
this election, I'm sure he and his party will accept it; and I 
don't accept to have violent repercussions from that. President 
Banda has on numerous occasions stated that the people must 
please be calm, and also to accept the results, whatever they 
may be. 
  [Bishop] Finally, and I must ask this. Will there be any 
problems with counting the votes in the Malawian election? 
  [Crewe-Brown] I don't think we'll have the problems that we 
had in South Africa. The votes are counted in the presence of 
the local monitors and where possible in the presence of 
international monitors at each polling station. From there the 
votes are then taken through to the district commissioner, and I 
don't really think that we should have any serious problems 
there, and I expect that the final results should be out by the 
latest on Friday. But by tomorrow there should be an indication 
already how things stand. 
  [Bishop] Mr. Crewe-Brown, thank you very much for giving up 
your time. 
  [Crewe-Brown] Great pleasure.

parliamentary and presidential elections continues. MBC 
correspondents around the country said so far indications are 
that the Alliance for Democracy, AFORD, is doing very well in 
the northern region. The Malawi Congress Party, MCP, is gaining 
ground in the central Region and the United Democratic Front, 
UDF, is making steady progress in the southern region.

  [Text] Malawian Foreign Minister Dr. Hetherwick Ntaba says 
there is no proof that the Mozambique National Resistance is 
harboring Malawi Young Pioneers. Dr. Ntaba added that his 
government has always been willing to repatriate the probable 
elements of the military wing of President Banda's party, but 
that has not yet happened. The Malawian foreign minister was 
speaking to a group of Southern African Development Community 
journalists at the end of the parliamentary session which 
adopted Malawi's new constitution. Dr. Ntaba noted that all 
members of the armed unit were demobilized soon after the 
referendum held in 1993 following complaints by opposition 
parties.

<F P=106> [Report from Nampula by correspondent Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>
  [Text] At mass rallies held in the capitals of Malema and 
Lalaua Districts of Nampula Province today, President of the 
Republic Joaquim Chissano said the promoters of war in 
Mozambique have begun to return to the country, because they are 
convinced conditions have already been created to take the reins 
of power. Speaking to large crowds, Chissano mentioned the cases 
of Portuguese nationals currently residing in South Africa and 
Portugal as the ones returning to Mozambique, where they have 
launched a campaign to discredit the Mozambican Government. 
Chissano said the campaign is based on the old colonial 
principle that blacks have never been able to govern themselves. 
He said such people have always backed Renamo [Mozambique 
National Resistance] in the destruction of Mozambique, though 
they never believed in the capacity of Afonso Dhlakama's 
movement to govern anything. 
  The president of the republic said the destruction of the 
town of Lalaua, while it was under Renamo occupation for 45 days 
beginning July 1991, was ordered by those who have never 
accepted the country's independence. Chissano was referring to 
people who abandoned Mozambique before and after independence to 
settle in Portugal. 
  The president of the republic warned the residents of the 
two 
towns that in the current multiparty system there are people who 
promote campaigns on behalf of their parties, promising to 
resolve the nation's problems in a short period of time. 
  Chissano's speeches in Malema and Lalaua focused on peace, 
national reconciliation, and hard work on the basis of unity of 
all Mozambicans from north to south of the country. The 
Mozambican head of state accused those who claim that the 
Mozambique Government is formed mainly by southerners, of 
promoting division in the country. Chissano said that that was 
not true, giving as an example the various ministers included in 
his delegation who come from different parts of the country. 
Chissano added: Frelimo chooses competent people for 
government posts, regardless of their ethnic origin. 
  Malema residents demanded from Joaquim Chissano that 
passenger services be revamped along the recently renovated 
Nacala railroad. Nampula residents often travel on tank cars and 
rail cars. The residents also complained about serious cases of 
police brutality at railroad stations. Asked to explain the 
lack of passenger coaches, the director general of the 
Mozambique Railroad enterprise said that there were 200 
passenger coaches in 1975, but today there are only 46 
throughout the country. The others, he said, were destroyed 
during the war. Chissano commented on this issue, saying: those 
who destroyed the rail cars should buy them, instead of asking 
us for money. 
  As in his visits to Gaza, Sofala, and Tete Provinces, the 
president of the republic urged Malema and Lalaua residents to 
vote in large numbers during the October elections to choose the 
best representatives of the Mozambican society for the future 
government. 
  Chissano returned to the city of Nampula this evening. 
Tomorrow, he is scheduled to leave for Nacala where he will 
assess the damage caused by the Nadia cyclone and address a mass 
rally. Chissano will meet the province's businessmen after his 
return from Nacala.

<F P=106> [Report from Maputo by correspondent Barnaby Philips on the </F>
"Focus on Africa" program] 
  [Text] Mozambican Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi told me 
today that the Young Pioneers, who crossed from Malawi, are 
still in the northern Mozambican Provinces of Zambezia and Tete. 
Minister Mocumbi said that the Mozambican Government knows that 
these men are armed because they were told this by a Young 
Pioneer they captured in Zambezia Province. Minister Mocumbi 
was adamant that his government is not dealing in trivial 
accusations, but has solid evidence for its claims. 
  [Begin Mocumbi recording] What we are talking about is not 
rumor. It is a fact that a group of armed people crossed from 
Malawi to Mozambique. This is not a rumor at all. It is a fact 
that has been acknowledged by the Malawian authorities. [end 
recording] 
  The Mozambican Government does not know how many Young 
Pioneers have crossed the border, but feels that the Malawian 
Government is in a better position to provide this information. 
Minister Mocumbi said that there was a possibility that Renamo 
soldiers, who have been based in Malawi, also crossed into 
Mozambique at the same time as the Young Pioneers. The 
Mozambican Government is now considering taking the matter up 
with Renamo, whom it has accused in the past of sheltering the 
Young Pioneers. But Minister Mocumbi said the possibility of 
using force to expel these men was, in his words, an option that 
was remaining open.

<F P=106> [Interview with Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique </F>
National Resistance, by Emilio Manhique in Maputo on 17 May -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the Mozambique National 
Resistance [Renamo], left Maputo today for Maringue and the city 
of Quelimane, where he will meet with Renamo district delegates 
in Zambezia and Nampula Provinces. 
  [Dhlakama] Maringue is still our headquarters. It is the 
historic headquarters. So, I will just stop over there on my 
way to Quelimane, Zambezia Province. I will arrive in Maringue 
today. On 20 May, I will leave for Quelimane where I will 
attend a conference with all our district and provincial 
delegates from Zambezia and Nampula. They are assembled in 
Quelimane. 
  [Manhique] There is a question that I have been wanting to 
ask you for a long time now. The city of Beira is very close to 
Maringue. Yet, you have not gone there. Is there any special 
reason? 
  [Dhlakama] Beira is my home. 
  [Manhique] But you have never visited it. 
  [Dhlakama] When I am in Maringue, it is like being in Beira. 
Everyday I receive people from Beira -- our delegates, as well 
as relatives. To be in Beira is like being in Maringue. I am 
giving priority to the provinces which are distant from Maringue. 
  [Manhique] Have you already set a definite date to visit 
Beira? 
  [Dhlakama] Yes, I will be there in June. 
  [Manhique] For sure? 
  [Dhlakama] For sure. I will visit Beira, Manica, and 
Chimoio. 
  [Manhique] One has the feeling that the peace process is 
somewhat bogged down. It seems that there are many problems, 
things are not running smoothly, and there is some mistrust. 
Would you like to comment? 
  [Dhlakama] I can clarify that. There are no problems. What 
happens is that our Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] 
brothers are nervous. That is self-evident. That has been 
noticable over the past month. We understand the reason for 
their nervousness. It is because they have been in power alone 
for over 18 years, with no political opposition. In view of the 
pressure from the various political parties, Frelimo does not 
feel comfortable. Why do I say that? For instance, now the 
question is whether the army should consist of 30,000 or 15,000 
men. We have already said time is running out. It is 
impossible to train 30,000 men before elections are held. The 
government, however, insists that we go for it. Meanwhile, the 
government has not made preparations for training. That makes us 
believe that the government will continue to press for an army 
of 30,000 men, thought it will not be able to do that. So, by 
October the government will say that there can be no elections 
because we have not completed training the army. 
  We are insisting to the government that we should only train 
half of the required number. The other half will be selected 
and sent home on leave for about three or four months. After 
the elections, they will be called up. We are, however, 
negotiating with the government. 
  [Manhique] It appears that there is a great deal of 
confusion 
in Sofala Province. Woodcutters claim you have assured them 
that they can operate freely. There are, let us say, little 
Renamo chiefs who are complicating things. Are you going to 
deal with this issue? 
  [Dhlakama] There is no confusion. We have grown tired of 
this situation. Our policy is to protect economic resources. 
We have never allowed more than 150 people, claiming to be 
woodcutters, to go about destroying the forest. That is where 
we differ from Frelimo. Nobody has given them permission. At my 
base in Maringue I received more than 150 woodcutters after the 
signing of the General Peace Accord. We cannot allow people to 
destroy the whole forest. We are protecting the forest. The 
woodcutters have no reforestation program. They fell tress and 
that is it. So, we are protecting the forest. It is not true 
to say that I have given permission to fell trees and then a 
little chief contradicts that. 
  [Manhique] So, what the woodcutters are saying is not true. 
  [Dhlakama] It is not true.

  [Text] In the city of Nampula today, the police were 
involved in violent clashes with former militiamen who guarded 
the Mademo wood company. The militiamen and Mademo workers have 
been on strike since yesterday, demanding the payment of salary 
arrears. The clash occurred when the police tried to disperse 
the demonstrators that have been gathering outside the 
Provincial Agriculture Directorate building since yesterday. A 
child and his mother were seriously wounded during the clash. 
Two policemen, including the commander of the city's police 
headquarters, were hit by bullets fired by their colleagues. 
Reports say the demonstrators had seized three firearms from 
policemen, but decided to return them following talks with 
mediators from the Provincial Agriculture Directorate. 
  Meanwhile, the mediators and workers' representatives have 
begun reviewing salary arrears dating back to 1991. The 
Ministry of Agriculture was today scheduled to send a check 
corresponding to the amount demanded by the workers. 
  Many of the city's shops remained closed today and road 
traffic suspended due to the demonstration involving some 90 
Mademo workers as well as former militiamen.

<F P=106> [Report from Quelimane by correspondent Abdul Madib] </F>
  [Text] A communique issued by the Zambezia branch of the 
Mozambique Liberal and Democratic Party, Palmo, and disseminated 
by Radio Mozambique, says it is worried about recent political 
developments in the country and about peace, in the wake of the 
emergence of the so-called Rombezia [Rovuma-Zambezia] grouping. 
Palmo says Rombezia is headed by militants of the ruling Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] Party who, together with Gimo 
Phiri, have been forcibly recruiting youths, training and arming 
them. The communique says Rombezia stems from a Frelimo 
maneuver aimed at disrupting the elections scheduled for October. 
  We spoke to Domingos Sande, a member of the Frelimo Party's 
Provincial Committee and head of its Organization Department. 
Sande says he regrets Palmo's attitude in disseminating, quote, 
a shameless lie, unquote. He said the communique is completely 
false, noting that Frelimo stands for national unity, whereas 
Rombezia is for secession. 
  [Begin Sande recording] As reported, Rombezia is a movement 
with separatist tendencies. That is against the Frelimo Party's 
policy. Actually, we have already informed the Central 
Committee and the issue was debated at its last session. We 
have been working with the government to disband the group.

<F P=106> [Report by Nkululeko Dlamini] </F>
  [Excerpt] Members of the Human Rights sub-committee of the 
Swaziland Law Society have described the Non-Bailable Offences 
(Amendment) Bill, 1994, as a double edged sword which must be 
removed. 
  The law is to be amended to strengthen its force, according 
to the Minister for Justice Chief Maweni Simelane. 
  The lawyers said this legislation is contrary to every 
civilised notion of justice. 
  This is contained in a series of documents prepared by the 
organisation and which have been made available to THE TIMES. 
  The lawyers said the law is likely to cause more harm than 
the good that is presumably intended. They said the proposed 
amendment to the non-bailable offence legislation seeks to 
deprive the courts of the last vestiges of discretion left to 
them. "The likelihood of injustice is increased," they said. 
They said it is essential that the Courts be left with a 
discretion to enable each case to be dealt with on its merits.

  [Text] Northwestern Province Deputy Minister Reverend Amos 
Chisipawa has directed police in Mililunga to close two shops 
opened on the Angolan border by a foreign investor. Addressing 
public workers at Mililunga Secondary School, Rev. Chipawa said 
that police in the area should not allow foreign investors to 
establish shops in the border area. He emphasized that 
investors interested in retail should establish shops at the 
Boma [traditional authority] and not border areas because the 
peace of the nation could be compromised. The minister called on 
Zambians to be security conscious and report suspicions 
characters to authorities.

  [Text] The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting 
Services has refuted accusations made by National Party 
president Mr. Baldwin Nkumbula that the government is 
intervening in the running of the media in Zambia. Reacting to 
a statement made by Mr. Nkumbula at a National Party press 
conference that government is hindering freedom of the press, 
Information Deputy Minister Mr. Eric Silomba said the 
allegations were false. He wondered why Mr. Nkumbula could say 
this when he was covered adequately by the press during the 
National Party convention in Mongu. Mr. Silomba said it is not 
the government's intention to block any political party from 
publicity. 
  Mr. Nkumbula claimed today that a free press will never 
exist 
in Zambia as long as media heads are appointed by the party in 
power.

  [Text] Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, worried that 
continued world attention on South Africa may marginalize 
neighboring Zimbabwe, will try to persuade British investors in 
London on Thursday to bolster his country's economy. 
  Zimbabwean leaders have been touring the world in the past 
few months on an investment campaign aimed at boosting an 
economy burdened by rising unemployment. The Zimbabwean 
president will concentrate in London on his country's track 
record of peace in contrast to continued violence in South 
Africa. Announcements on tax relief and amendments to the 
controversial program are also expected.

of ties with Iran and said Khartoum is proud of having relations 
with Tehran. In a meeting with Iranian ambassador to Khartoum 
Majid Kamal, Baridu voiced his country's readiness to promote 
bilateral ties with Iran. He termed his recent trip to Iran and 
his negotiations with Iranian officials as fruitful. 
  Meanwhile, the Sudanese official expressed regret over 
fierce 
fighting in Yemen and Afghanistan. Referring to the 
conspiracies masterminded by the world arrogance against 
Muslims, Baridu urged for an end to the ongoing genocide of 
Muslims and called for the settlement of their disputes through 
peaceful means. At the end of the meeting he welcomed the 
imminent trip of his Iranian counterpart 'Abbas Maleki to Sudan.

convened today in the town of Juba and comes as a confirmation 
and reassurance of the peace process and territorial integrity 
within the federal system. The conference also confirms that 
the Sudanese people share a common destiny, reject violence and 
fighting, and that the rebel movement still has the chance to 
return to the mainstream of the homeland so that all the sons of 
the homeland could embark on development and social and economic 
reconstruction.

  [Excerpt] Juba, 15 May (SUNA) -- The convention of Juba 
peace gathering affirms the southerners' extreme desire for 
peace, said Vice President Major General George Kongor. 
  Addressing the opening session of the gathering, Kongor said 
that the gathering is a message unanimously reached by the 
internal front to condemn the acts of those who back the 
continuation of the war in the south. The revolution, he said, 
is keen to achieve the Sudanese peoples' full desire for a 
comprehensive peace and stability in southern Sudan. All the 
Sudanese people reject the continuation of the 14-year war, he 
added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Juba political conference ended in the Bahr 
al-Jabal provincial capital today. It issued its resolutions 
and recommendations and the Juba declaration document. 
  The closing session was addressed by Angelo Beda, deputy 
speaker of the Transitional National Assembly and chairman of 
the conference steering committee, who said that the Juba 
conference constitutes a confirmation of national unity, a call 
to end the conflict, a prop for ongoing peace efforts, and an 
amplification of the voice of the silent majority of the sons of 
the south. He stressed that the conference was a means of 
strengthening federal rule, the policy adopted by the national 
salvation resolution to rebuild the country. Mr. Beda said the 
blend of cultures and different dialects emerging during the 
conference confirmed the keenness of the sons of the country to 
strengthen national unity. 
  Mr. Beda then read out the conference resolutions and 
recommendations, which broadly call for adherence to national 
unity and rejection of foreign interference aimed at weakening 
the country. The resolutions and recommendations condemned the 
desperate attempts by some southern factions to introduce 
proposals inconsistent with the views of the majority. The 
recommendations also stressed the need to establish just, 
permanent, and comprehensive peace; to speed up the end of the 
war; to adhere to the principles laid down by the national 
salvation revolution; to accept the federal system as a safe 
means of achieving national unity and to ensure effective 
participation in the process to ensure its success; and to 
establish a general authority to follow up the proceedings of 
the conference by steering the peace movement from within. 
  Afterwards, Professor 'Abd-al-Rahman Abu Zayd, rapporteur of 
the conference steering committee, presented the Juba 
declaration document, which appeals to those bearing arms to 
respond to the voice of reason, to stop the fighting, to return 
to the mainstream of the nation, to participate in the 
reconstruction of a respected and honored Sudan, to restore 
development and stability in the south, and to support ongoing 
efforts to establish peace from within.

  [Text] Yaounde, 16 May (AFP) -- Siga Assanga, secretary 
general of the radical Cameroonian opposition Social Democratic 
Front [SDF] party, was dismissed today at the end of the party's 
disciplinary council meeting, sources close to the opposition in 
Yaounde disclosed. Mr. Assanga has appealed against the 
disciplinary council's decision and the difference is expected 
to be settled for good at the next party congress. 
  The council, which met in Bamenda, capital of the Northwest 
Province, accused Mr. Assanga, the movement's second in command, 
of having tried to approach the government for possible SDF 
participation in a national union government. SDF Chairman John 
Fru Ndi has, since the multiparty presidential elections in 
1992, opposed the participation of his party in such a 
government. Fru Ndi, who stood in those elections, contested 
President Paul Biya's reelection.

<F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>
  [Text] The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel 
[Vorgan], UNITA's [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] radio station, is still at the center of talks between 
the government and UNITA. An accord could be signed soon, 
although there are still differences between the government and 
UNITA about Vorgan. UNITA agrees that as a political party it 
cannot operate a radio station. Vorgan will remain in the air 
for the years to come, though with a different format. UNITA 
says it does not have any other means of conveying its message 
within the framework of national reconciliation. 
  Today's talks became bogged down around the news media law 
because the delegations wanted to know who has the monopoly over 
radio broadcasting and who can broadcast on short wave. The 
government, UNITA, the mediator, and the observers had not read 
the law, or pretended to ignore it. So they adjourned for today 
for consultations. Tomorrow they will return to the negotiating 
table, but better equipped. 
  Meanwhile, sources close to the mediator said today that the 
government and UNITA have been considering the reinstatement of 
state administration throughout Angola and UNITA's participation 
at various administrative levels.

  [Text] Emil Zinsou, Benin's first president, was at the 
Futungo de Belas Palace today to convey a message to President 
Jose Eduardo dos Santos from Nicephore Soglo, the current 
president of Benin. The president of the Republic received the 
envoy of the head of state of Benin at the Futungo de Belas 
Palace early this afternoon. 
  Apart from conveying the message, Emil Zinsou introduced to 
the Angolan head of state Dr. Fagna, a scientist from Benin who 
recently discovered a medicine to lessen the [words indistinct] 
in human beings. The discovery has already been recognized by 
the World Health Organization, and many African and other 
countries have been expressing their interest in the new 
medicine. Emil Zinsou, the first head of state of Benin, held 
power until 1968. 
  [Begin Zinsou recording] I then briefed the Angolan head of 
state on an important project. I am a doctor, and this project 
deals with a widespread disease among blacks, Africans, and the 
American people. It is called (?trypanosomiasis), a disease 
which attacks red cells. Like malaria, it is a very common 
disease among Africans. My compatriot here Professor Fagna 
found a medicine which had never been discovered before. He has 
already had an opportunity to treat some Angolans. Thus, we 
want to maintain with the Angolan people and government close 
contacts so that this medicine can cure the largest number 
possible of Africans. This will also permit us to develop 
efforts to discover new medicines for other diseases. The 
Angolan president received our views favorably. [end recording]

  [Text] As counting continues in the country's first 
multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections, unofficial 
results from various parts of the country show that the United 
Democratic Front, UDF, has made significant gains, especially in 
the southern region. Our correspondents covering the elections 
say that the Alliance for Democracy, AFORD, have taken most of 
the seats in the northern region but has failed badly in the 
central and southern region. 
  The correspondents say several ministers in the current 
cabinet have lost their parliamentary seats. These include the 
minister of justice and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore 
Munlo; the minister of forestry and natural resources, Hon. 
Mfunjo Mwanjasi Mwakikunga; the minister of energy and mining, 
Hon. Michael Mlambala; the vice president of the Malawi Congress 
Party, MCP, Hon. Bwanda Chakuamba; the minister at large, Hon. 
Sonnex Chitsonga; and the minister of labor, Hon. William Binali.

  [Text] Dr. Kamuzu Banda, who has ruled Malawi as a 
one-party state for 30 years, has been defeated in the country's 
first democratic elections. 
  By last night, Mr. Bakili Muluzi, of the United Democratic 
Front, the UDF, had received 960,000 votes in the presidential 
election, compared with Dr. Banda's 418,000. In the 
parliamentary election the UDF had taken 74 seats compared with 
56 won by Dr. Banda's Malawi Congress Party. The Alliance for 
Democracy had won 36 seats. The results of 11 constituencies 
were still outstanding. The UDF said it needed 89 seats as a 
minimum to gain a working majority of 51 percent. This meant 
that the party needed 15 more seats. The official results are 
expected today. 
  Preliminary results of the presidential election put UDF 
leader, Bakili Muluzi, ahead -- with President Kamuzu Banda only 
third behind the Alliance for Democracy's Chakufwa Chihana.

urged by Nacala residents to contest the multiparty elections 
scheduled for October 1994. The call was made today at a rally 
he chaired in Nacala as part of his working visit to Nampula

which the head of state urged Nacala and Nacala-a-Velha 
residents to vote en masse in the upcoming elections to choose 
the finest representatives of Mozambican society as the 
country's future leaders. President Chissano's speech at the

  [Excerpt] The Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] met 
in Maputo yesterday. It expressed its understanding for the 
government's request to complete the confinement of its troops 
into assembly areas by 1 July and their demobilization on 15 
August. This increases by one month the schedule set by the UN 
Security Council. The CSC expressed its appreciation for 
Renamo's [Mozambique National Resistance] decision to comply 
with the schedule set by the Security Council. 
  UN representative Aldo Ajello said the dates can only be 
meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army is 
resolved. [passage omitted] 
  [Ajello] "What I said was that all those dates will be 
meaningful if the problem of the formation of the new army has 
been resolved. We can only deal with that problem once all 
soldiers have been demobilized. There will be soldiers selected 
for the new army who would be (?waiting) at assembly areas. The 
assembly areas would have to be closed on those dates -- namely, 
on 1 June and 15 July for Renamo, and on 1 July and 15 August 
for the government. The manner in which we will organize the 
formation of the new army is a vital question that ought to be 
addressed in tandem with the confinement and demobilization of 
troops. This aspect was pointed out to the (?government). We 
all agree on how to go about it, though what we need to consider 
is the solution to that problem. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] "Do you not think the new dates 
will complicate matters for the National Elections Commission 
[CNE] since it wants to start registering voters? 
  [Ajello] "It could complicate [words indistinct] the next 
CSC 
meeting will discuss this issue with the CNE chairman. That is 
an important issue. I am aware that the CNE chairman expected 
the whole process to be completed by June when registration of 
voters is due to start. I will meet with him to see what 
implications the government's position will have on the CNE. I 
will ask him to brief the CSC on that issue. 
  [Correspondent] "The registration of voters is scheduled to 
start within about two weeks, but the whole country is still far 
from being free to everybody. Do you think [words indistinct]? 
  [Ajello] "That issue was discussed at length today and two 
important decisions were made. First, the accord signed by the 
presidents of the Republic and of Renamo at the August and 
September 1993 summits should be implemented as soon as 
possible. Specifically, Renamo advisers should be integrated 
into provincial administrations and [words indistinct] people to 
carry out such duties. 
  "We will give the green light to all political parties and 
individuals to move freely throughout the country. Whenever 
there is a problem, the CSC should be informed at once. The CSC 
will then contact Renamo with a view to resolving disputes at 
once. What we have now is Renamo's firm commitment that the 
whole territory is open. 
  "Another important aspect is that Renamo has accepted that 
members of the Mozambican and UN police forces will be deployed 
in its former areas to monitor the situation. This will speed 
up the integration of Renamo areas into state administration. 
That is an important issue which we have discussed for a long 
time now. Today we formally agreed that [words indistinct] I 
personally discussed this issue with the Renamo president 
yesterday. I am waiting for Interior Minister Manuel Antonio to 
return from his trip to discuss with him ways of deploying 
Mozambican policemen and UN police personnel in former Renamo 
areas." 
  The government delegation to the CSC was headed by Minister 
John Kachamila. Ministers Guebuza and Hunguana have gone to 
Rome. Kachamila said the government had proposed the new dates 
at informal meetings for further action. He noted that before 
consensus was reached by all sides, the UN Operations in 
Mozambique proposed those dates to the Security Council, 
unilaterally. [passage omitted] 
  [Unidentified correspondent] "Since it is impossible to form 
a new army before elections are held, what is the government's 
view about the suggestion that the 15,000 men who have not been 
trained should be sent home on leave and be called up after 
elections are held? 
  [Kachamila] "The government does not agree with that because 
there is no reason for not creating the armed forces provided 
for in the General Peace Accord. It is a force of 30,000 men 
and manpower is available. There are financial problems, but 
what we need to do is resolve them. So, we do not think the 
solution is to send those men on leave [words indistinct] our 
position is to complete the formation of the new armed forces." 
  Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation, asked the 
government to reconsider its position. Domingos reiterated his 
party's position to comply with the Security Council dates. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] "Do you think you can meet the deadline set 
by the Security Council? 
  [Domingos] "Yes, we think we can. We are able to do it with 
all the assistance that the UN technical unit can give us. It 
is not only a question of Renamo demobilizing its forces. There 
are technical mechanisms to be complied with so that 
demobilization may take place with all the required guarantees. 
  [Correspondent] "Certain quarters say Renamo is calling for 
an army of 15,000 men because you do not have enough manpower? 
  [Domingos] "That is not a position defended by Renamo. It is 
a proposal that Renamo has accepted. Renamo is open to other 
positive proposals that could be taken into account for the 
effective implementation of the peace accord." 
  A spokesman for the international observers at the CSC 
stated 
their firm support for the UN Security Council decisions on the 
Mozambican peace process. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] advisers in 
Nampula Province have welcomed President Joaquim Chissano's 
guidelines on the speedy appointment of administrators and other 
officials to areas controlled by Afonso Dhlakama's organization. 
Interviewed by the MOZAMBIQUE INFORMATION AGENCY, the Renamo 
advisers said the head of state's guidelines once again show 
that he loves peace. Adviser Luis Trinta said the main problem 
faced with the reintegration of Renamo's areas into central 
administration is lack of transportation, not for personal use 
but for official duties.

  [Text] The UN Office for Humanitarian Assistance 
Coordination [UNOHAC] reports that some 75 percent of the more 
than 3.7 million displaced persons had already been settled 
throughout the country by February 1994. UNOHAC says just over 
950,000 people still need to be resettled, the largest number of 
which are in Sofala, Tete, and Gaza Provinces. The figures 
refer to people forced to abandon their areas because of the war 
and natural disasters. It was estimated that there was just 
over 5 million displaced persons, including 1.5 million refugees 
in neighboring countries when the General Peace Accord was 
signed in October 1992.

  [Excerpt] On 5 May Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] 
once again refused to ratify a scheme to assist demobilized 
troops, a scheme which was approved months ago by the 
Reintegration Commission, Core. Both sides and Aldo Ajello, UN 
secretary general special representative in Mozambique, have 
already signed the scheme. 
  The document has already been referred six times to the 
Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] for ratification, but 
Renamo refuses to sign it, citing its war crippled as the reason. 
  It is a document in terms of which the international 
community assists in the reintegration of demobilized troops. 
At the 5 May session of the CSC, Renamo specifically linked the 
ratification of the document to the solution of its war crippled. 
  The government's position on this issue is that Renamo's 
crippled will eventually have to find a solution with the 
support of the international community, though the problem 
should not prevent the ratification of the general scheme for 
demobilized troops which has already been approved. 
  A Renamo source says Afonso Dhlakama's movement wants its 
crippled to be covered by the country's pension scheme. The 
problem is that the pension scheme operates on the basis of 
deductions from the salaries of civil servants and soldiers. 
That makes it impossible to apply the scheme to the crippled. 
  The government argues that it is necessary to discuss and 
find a solution other than the pension scheme "because it 
completely violates the legal standing of how a pension scheme 
operates." 
  The government also argues that the problem of the crippled 
is not included in the document dealing with assistance to 
demobilized troops, which is largely financed by the 
international community and was approved at a Core meeting. 
Renamo, the government, and the UN Operations in Mozambique 
attended the meeting and signed the document. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Gossip" [Bula-Bula] page] </F>
  [Excerpts] A question with a ready answer is doing the 
rounds in diplomatic circles. These are always fertile ground 
for subtle comments. The question is: How many members does 
Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] have? Some say it has 
two, but there are doubts about one of them. There are doubts 
about Afonso Dhlakama, but there is certainty about FRG 
ambassador to Mozambique Helmut Rau [name as published]. 
[passage omitted] 
  Diplomatic gossip about the FRG ambassador stems from Helmut 
Rau's commitment to his country's decision to equip Renamo with 
a radio station which will operate with FRG assistance. 
  The situation has given rise to conflicting commentaries. 
The FRG ambassador alleges that his government's intention is 
to put Renamo on an equal footing with the Frelimo [Mozambique 
Liberation Front] government in order to guarantee democracy. 
Others comment that it is a clear case of interference in the 
political affairs of another country, and that the FRG 
Government failed to assess the legal aspects of the situation. 
The Frelimo government has no radio station. There is a public 
radio station in Mozambique, which, according to its statutes, 
is independent from the political decisionmaking bodies. Renamo 
has access to that station. 
  The FRG ambassador has already realized that his gesture 
(his 
country's) has upset Frelimo, and according to reliable sources 
he is believed to have tried to remedy the situation, arguing 
that it is pointless to make an issue out of it since it is a 
short wave station which will be heard by very few people -- a 
view shared by Renamo -- and that Frelimo could apply for air 
time on Renamo's radio. 
  Frelimo leaders have reacted: "Wait a minute!" That means 
to give Renamo the status of a government. They have asked: 
"What has made the FRG support Renamo when there are many 
political parties in Mozambique, which, for the same reasons, 
need radio stations?" 
  The controversy behind closed doors has not ended. It is 
clear that diplomacy's subtly will result in new commentaries, 
riddled with radiographic hints.

  [Text] His Majesty the king has encouraged unflinching 
partnership between the European Union and the African, 
Caribbean, and Pacific countries, ACP, even beyond the year 
2000, saying the challenges ahead call for stronger bonds. 
  Officially opening the 19th session of the ACP-European 
Union 
Council of Ministers at the Convention Center in Mbabane this 
afternoon, the king commended the cooperation that has been 
existing, saying it helped a great deal in ensuring a healthy 
economic evolution among a host of ACP member states. 
  He paid special tribute to the EEC for having been the 
biggest contributor towards the development of Swaziland in the 
fields of personnel training, agriculture, and the improvement 
of the kingdom's road network. 
  The king hailed the latest developments in South Africa and 
Mozambique. He hoped that Malawi will also be able to attain 
the peace that now prevails in South Africa after the democratic 
elections, and the tranquility that is expected of Mozambique 
after the signing of a cease-fire between the rebel Renamo 
[Mozambique National Resistance] and the ruling Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front]. 
  He expressed concern about violence in Rwanda and Bosnia, 
saying everybody should pray for an end to the killings. A 
total of 82 countries are represented at the meeting. Most 
speakers echoed the king's speech of the political changes in 
South Africa, Mozambique, Rwanda, and Bosnia.

  [Text] The chairperson of the Zambia Civic Education 
Association, Mrs. Lucy Sikwana, said police officers should be 
trained on the criminal procedure code to stop the torturing of 
suspects. Mrs. Sikwana said the inhuman treatment of suspects 
in police cells should not be allowed in a country which 
respects human rights. She made the remark at the opening of a 
police and community program at the central police station in 
Lusaka. The inspector general of police, Francis Ndlovo, said 
the police force cannot operate well because it does not receive 
adequate funding.

  [Excerpts] Ugandan troops of the expanded ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West Africa States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], of 
the multinational African peacekeeping force in Liberia, are 
today being deployed in the southeast of the country. The 
Ugandan peacekeepers are travelling by sea to Maryland County, 
where they will be received by county officials, chiefs, elders, 
and ordinary citizens, as well as UN officials including 
Ambassador Trevor Gordon-Somers. The deployment, which has been 
described by observers as long overdue, is in compliance with 
the Cotonou Peace Agreement, which mandates the disarmament, 
encampment, and demobilization of NPFL [National Patriotic Front 
of Liberia] soldiers under the auspices of the expanded ECOMOG. 
  The deployment of the Ugandan contingent in the southeast 
follows several hours of talks during discussions between UN 
Envoy Trevor Gordon-Somers and former NPRG [National Patriotic 
Reconstruction Government] President Charles Gankay Taylor last 
evening. The meeting, held at the Executive Mansion in Gbarnga, 
is believed to have centered on removing the obstacles in the 
way of the peace process. 
  The slow pace of the deployment, which is a prerequisite for 
the disarmament exercise of all fighting groups in the country, 
has been the main hurdle in carrying out the military aspects of 
the Cotonou Accord. (?Commercial) interests in the factional 
fighting within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy 
in Liberia] has been dragging the peace process to the brink of 
collapse. 
  Nigerian and Ghanaian [as heard] troops of the old ECOMOG 
have been selling arms to the opposing sides within ULIMO. 
Intelligence sources in ECOMOG revealed last week that the 
Guineans were selling arms to the Mandingo faction of ULIMO, 
while the Nigerian contingent is in the business of arms sales 
to the Krahn elements of ULIMO. [passage omitted] 
  News just coming in from Monrovia says the forces loyal to 
the leader of the Mandingo faction, Mr. Alhaji Koromah, are 
being surrounded in Monrovia by security forces. Some have been 
arrested and are presently under detention at various 
headquarters in Monrovia, awaiting interrogation by the joint 
security. General Koromah [title as heard] is alleged to have 
imported mercenaries into the country under the guise of being 
businessmen in the city. According to reports from Monrovia, 
some of the mercenaries are now selling towels, clothes, [word 
indistinct], and other valuable items, while others are directly 
[word indistinct] with Mr. Koromah and with Sierra Leonean and 
Guinean ECOMOG soldiers.
