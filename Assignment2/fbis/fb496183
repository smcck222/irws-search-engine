  [Excerpt] Nairobi, 26 May (AFP) -- Rwandan rebels pressed 
their offensive to capture the capital Kigali Thursday [26 May] 
as a UN special envoy sought to persuade them to accept a 
ceasefire already agreed by government forces, relief officials 
and diplomats said. The rebels pounded Kigali with artillery and 
mortar fire shortly after the UN envoy, Iqbal Riza, left the 
embattled capital Thursday to meet rebel leaders in their 
northern stronghold of Mulindi, relief officials said. 
  The rebels reportedly advanced further against battered and 
demoralised government forces to capture another key eastern 
district near Kigali's airport, which they took from the army 
Sunday, the officials said. 
  Riza is trying to negotiate a ceasefire to allow the United 
Nations to deploy 5,500 peacekeepers in Rwanda, where 200,000 to 
500,000 people have been slaughtered in relentless attacks by 
pro-government militiamen against minority Tutsis and Hutu 
opposition supporters. 
  Diplomats in the region said the government had agreed to a 
ceasefire but the mainly Tutsi rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front 
(RPF) was unlikely to do so because a military victory was 
within sight. 
  The rebels have said they want to seize control of as much 
of 
Rwanda as possible to staunch the bloodbath, and seem anxious 
that UN peacekeepers might arrive before they have had time to 
rout the army, the diplomats said. "The success of Riza's 
mission hangs on the RPF's acceptance of a ceasefire," a senior 
Western diplomat told AFP. "It will be difficult for the UN to 
achieve much here unless both sides stop fighting," said the 
diplomat, who requested anonymity. 
  Riza met rebel leader Paul Kagame in Mulindi on Monday, but 
failed to persuade him to drop his demand for the United Nations 
to cut the size of its planned force from 5,500 to 2,500. 
  On Tuesday Riza went to Kigali for talks with Army chief of 
staff Augustin Bizimungu, followed by talks with members of the 
self- proclaimed all-Hutu interim government at its refuge in 
Gitarama, 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of the capital. 
The government and Army accepted his proposals for a ceasefire, 
according to the diplomats. 
  But even if the RPF also goes along, the future of the 
proposed UN peacekeeping mission is still uncertain. Western 
countries, shaken by the world body's failure to end anarchy in 
Somalia despite heavy losses among foreign peacekeepers there, 
are reluctant to commit troops to another perilous African 
venture, diplomats said. 
  UN Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali on Wednesday 
complained that the world had turned its back on the "genocide" 
in Rwanda. "Let's recognise that it is a failure not only for 
the UN but also for the international community," he told a news 
conference at UN headquarters in New York. "All of us are 
responsible for this failure." "Unless we have the support of 
the member-states, we will not be able to obtain the troops 
which we need on the ground," he said. 
  The UN Human Rights Commission has appointed a lawyer from 
Ivory Coast to investigate the bloodletting, in which civilians 
have been systematically hacked, clubbed, burned and shot to 
death, according to witnesses. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By David Chazan] </F>
  [Excerpts] Nairobi, May 26 (AFP) -- Battered and bedraggled 
Rwandan soldiers started fleeing the embattled capital Kigali on 
Thursday [26 May] as rebels appeared on the verge of taking the 
city despite an agreement to open ceasefire talks, military 
sources in Kigali said. 
  A special United Nations envoy meanwhile said the rebel 
Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had agreed to open discussions 
about a ceasefire with the army on Monday, a UN spokesman said. 
  The army has already agreed to the principle of a ceasefire 
to allow the UN to fly desperately needed food and medicine to 
the survivors of a six-week bloodbath in which up to half a 
million of Rwanda's seven million people are estimated to have 
been butchered. 
  "The commanders of both sides have accepted the proposal of 
the special representative of the secretary-general to open 
ceasefire talks," spokesman Abdul Kabia told AFP by telephone 
from Kigali. "These talks will be held in Kigali and will start 
Monday. The top commanders will not come, but will be 
represented at staff level by their deputies," Kabia said. 
  Kabia said an army brigadier and a rebel commander would 
attend the UN-mediated meeting. 
  But UN military sources and diplomats said that with the 
rebel takeover of Kigali imminent, and demoralised government 
soldiers short of ammunition and starting to join a massive 
exodus of terrified civilians from the capital, the discussions 
may come after the effective end of a three-year civil war. 
[passage omitted covered in referent items] 
  The UN military sources meanwhile reported that army 
commanders and some ordinary soldiers were starting to join 
thousands of terrified Hutus streaming out of Kigali on foot. 
  "Rumours that the city is about to fall are spreading and 
people are scared of retaliation for the killings of Tutsis," 
said a UN official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The 
official estimated that a rebel victory was "a few more days 
away." 
  Minority Tutsis dominate the rebel movement, led by Rwandan 
exiles who fled to Uganda to escape ethnic massacres in the 
runup to independence from Belgium in 1962. 
  Kabia, speaking by telephone from Kigali, said the RPF had 
agreed to meet army commanders Monday to discuss a ceasefire. 
  But a senior Western diplomat familiar with Rwanda said the 
battle-weary government forces "could simply be forced to 
surrender." "They're short of ammunition, their morale is low, 
their government has run away to a town outside the capital, and 
they're scared of taking the blame for the massacres," a UN 
military source in Kigali said. 
  The rebel agreement to discuss ceasefire terms nevertheless 
signalled a breakthrough for Riza, but the rebels still oppose 
the planned deployment of 5,500 UN peacekeepers in Rwanda and 
demand a maximum of 2,500. 
  The UN, condemned by aid agencies for withdrawing all but 
400 
of its 2,500 soldiers from Rwanda after president Juvenal 
Habyarimana's death in an alleged April 6 rocket attack on his 
plane, is struggling anyway to muster the planned new force. 
[passage omitted] 
  Riza was to leave Rwanda on Friday to review another heavily 
criticised UN peacekeeping operation in Somalia's anarchic 
capital Mogadishu, where the failure of tens of thousands of 
foreign soldiers to end factional fighting has dampened 
enthusiasm for another perilous mission in Africa. [passage 
omitted]

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Today the RPF [Rwandan 
Patriotic Front] combatants captured the important Ruhango trade 
center. The Ruhango trade center, which is located in Tambwe 
Commune, Ruhango Subprefecture, is the most important 
marketplace in the country. Traders from various neighboring 
countries like Burundi, Zaire, Tanzania, and Uganda meet each 
other there. The Ruhango trade center, which has fallen into 
the hands of RPF combatants, is located some 20 km south of the 
capital of Gitarama Prefecture, and some 12 km from Buyanza. 
  The RPF combatants are making progress in their fight 
against 
the country's enemies to put an end to the massacres of innocent 
people.

  [Text] Kinshasa, May 26 (AFP) -- Zairian President Mobutu 
Sese Seko has recommended the immediate demilitarisation of the 
Rwandan capital of Kigali, the Zairois Press Agency AZAP said 
Thursday [26 May]. 
  "It is vital to declare Kigali and an area up to 20 
kilometres around the town neutral," the Zairian president said. 
  Mobutu said this would allow "the intervention of United 
Nations forces, emergency services of humanitarian 
organisations, as well as the setting up of a government of 
national union following talks between the two parties to the 
conflict." 
  Zaire, along with Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, borders the 
tiny east African nation where up to half a million people have 
been killed in fighting between the majority Hutus and minority 
Tutsis since early April.

  [Text] In Kigali, arms still dictate the law. However, 
there is some relative hope now for securing an end to the 
current nightmare. Finally, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], 
which has been marching down on Kigali, has accepted to resume 
talks with its enemies. RPF spokesman Jean-Baptiste Gawumba 
speaks on the issue. 
  [Begin recording] [Gawumba] We have always maintained that 
we 
agree to negotiate with the government Armed Forces in order to 
stop the massacres. Right from the beginning our standpoint was 
made known not only to the international community but also to 
the government forces themselves. Some conditions were set to 
ensure the success of the negotiations with the government 
forces. So, this is not the first time that we are accepting to 
negotiate with the government forces to get them to put an end 
to the massacre of the people. However, we do not think we are 
making this condition -- stopping the massacres -- a 
prerequisite for negotiations . 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Zaire's President Mobutu has 
recommended the demilitarization of Kigali, the Rwandan capital. 
  [Gawumba] Look, I believe we said we belong to a country 
that 
enjoys national sovereignty. We do not believe that the 
proposal of demilitarized areas can be imposed. As far as we 
are concerned, we cannot accept the proposed demilitarization of 
either the airport or RPF-controlled areas. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Prime Minister-Designate Faustin </F>
Twagiramungu by unidentified correspondent -- live] 
  [Text] [Twagiramungu] Good afternoon. 
  [Correspondent] You are the prime minister appointed after 
the Arusha Agreement. You are now in France to hold talks with 
French officials. Mr. Twagiramungu, what do you think about the 
statement UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali made 
yesterday evening? The UN secretary general was really desperate 
and worried by the situation in your country. 
  [Twagiramungu] It is true, the UN secretary general is 
saddened by what is going on in my country, Rwanda. But I think 
that we should not be as discouraged and worried as he is. The 
Rwandan people must know that the situation in our country is a 
Rwandan problem. We Rwandans must try by all means to find a 
viable solution so that peace is restored. 
  [Correspondent] We will come back to this point, but do you 
agree with Butrus Butrus-Ghali who says that the international 
community has failed because it has done nothing? 
  [Twagiramungu] I do agree because I think that what is going 
on in Rwanda is quite a scandal. It raises questions about the 
sensibility of people and about our sense of humanity. This 
massacre--which is actually being called a genocide 
today...[pauses] We cannot understand how people are not worried 
by what is going on and do not want to find a solution. Today 
we are talking about genocide. It is not only a word today. We 
have had UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda] 1; we are now 
waiting for UNAMIR 2. But we do not see the international 
community reacting positively. This is why--when you see what 
is going on in Rwanda--I think it is a failure and a shameful 
thing for the international community. 
  [Correspondent] What do you think of the special 
investigator 
appointed to investigate the massacres for four weeks? 
  [Twagiramungu] I think that it is just the first step. Quite 
frankly I must admit that I am absolutely not satisfied with 
that. I am not the only one by the way. With such a genocide, 
we cannot avoid setting up an international court to try and 
punish the criminals. I do not see any difference between what 
is happening in Rwanda and what happened in Germany between 1940 
and 1945. There was a genocide there, there were serious 
problems there, similar to ours. Why cannot the international 
community set up an international court to judge these 
criminals. Moreover, if they are not tried they will think that 
they can continue and resume the massacres in some years' time. 
This is why we will lobby the international community so that 
the court is set up. That will be the beginning of the 
solution. Otherwise, we will encourage the killers. 
  [Correspondent] There has been talk of sending 5,500 UN 
troops to Rwanda, but they have not been found yet. 
Nobody--almost nobody--wants to send troops. 
  [Twagiramungu] I personally think that they do not want to. 
It is as if they were saying: Look, it is a small country, 
there are massacres and there is genocide. We must not get 
involved and we are not interested in that. They should be 
allowed to continue until they stop. As I told you before, it 
is a huge failure and we are disappointed. 
  [Correspondent] This is what you really feel? 
  [Twagiramungu] This is what I feel. The international 
community should understand that there are serious problems. 
People have been killing each other for almost two months, and 
the killers are left to do what they want. We must employ all 
available means to stop the killers. 
  [Correspondent] Let us now talk about the situation there 
and about the war. There are massacres and there is war. Is 
there something else that could be done other than a military 
solution? We have the feeling that the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic 
Front] is gaining ground. 
  [Twagiramungu] Yes, the RPF is gaining ground. It has always 
put forward conditions to end the war and the massacres. Let us 
talk about the massacres first. These are two different things. 
The massacres were started by the regular army and in 
particular, by the Presidential Guard. The war was just the 
consequence of the massacres. 
  What can we do today? First, those who started the massacres 
should decide to stop. I launch an appeal from here to the 
Rwandan Army and to the government put in place by a hidden 
coup. Another solution is that the Rwandan Army and the 
RPF--after the war started by the RPF--try to start talks. But 
it is still necessary to stop the massacres first. 
  In other words, in order to solve the problem (?we would 
like 
to see) on the ground a military victory of any kind by the RPF. 
I do not know whether the RPF agrees on this point. [passage 
as heard] In any case the RPF controls Kanombe Airport and the 
country's most important barracks today. They should understand 
that the time has now come for talks so that the other party can 
give a positive answer and fulfill the conditions set by the 
RPF, that is the end of massacres. They must talk and solve 
this Rwandan problem, because it is a problem that concerns us 
all. 
  [Correspondent] Does the Arusha Agreement have any kind of 
validity left. Is it still possible to discuss? 
  [Twagiramungu] I do not think so, and luckily the other 
political players do not think so either. 
  [Correspondent] With whom do you accept to talk with right 
now? 
  [Twagiramungu] You mean myself, or the democratic forces and 
parties for change? 
  [Correspondent] Yourself. 
  [Twagiramungu] I prefer to talk to all those who are 
interested in the situation in my country: The RPF, the 
democratic forces for change. I am also interested in finding 
moderates within the parties that started the massacres: The 
MRND [Republican National Movement for Democracy and 
Development] and the CDR [Coalition for the Defense of the 
Republic]. 
  [Correspondent] What will you personally do in the next few 
weeks? 
  [Twagiramungu] In the next few weeks I will start to 
meet--it 
has already been decided--members of the democratic parties for 
change. I will also meet members of the RPF's Executive 
Committee. I think we must continue to look together for 
solutions that may put an end to fighting. 
  [Correspondent] It seems that the RPF absolutely does not 
want to talk to the MRND and the CDR. However, you are in favor 
of dialogue. 
  [Twagiramungu] I do not want to talk to the parties. I want 
to talk to those who showed some restraint and who were not 
involved in the latest massacres. 
  [Correspondent] What should be the UN troops' precise role? 
The RPF does not want any buffer force. 
  [Twagiramungu] The RPF does not want a buffer force and I do 
not want a buffer force, but yesterday in New York the RPF 
decided that these 5,500 people should go to Rwanda to provide 
security in areas to be chosen, provide security in the food 
supplies corridor, and respond to attack from the militia's. 
Otherwise, I cannot see the goal of the mission. 
  [Correspondent] How is your relationship with the French 
authorities now? 
  [Twagiramungu] We just exchange information. As I am a 
witness of what is going on in my country, I have given enough 
information and have asked clear questions on the situation. I 
have been told that France does not provide weapons anymore to 
the Rwandan regular army. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you.

  [Excerpts] Dr. Anastase Gasana, the minister for foreign 
affairs in the government of the late Mrs. Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, has said that the cease-fire talked about by the 
government in Rwanda is not sincere but an attempt to gain time 
and carry out the Machiavellian plan to reinstall the Republican 
National Movement for Democracy and Development [MRND] 
government. In a memorandum to the Rwandan peace talks 
facilitator President Ali Hassan Mwinyi of Tanzania, Dr. 
Anastase Gasana said that the government and the army in Rwanda 
have been surprised by the resolve and the strike forces of the 
Rwandan Patriotic Army [RPA], and they are now trying to buy 
time to reorganize. 
  Dr. Anastase Gasana said that since the outbreak of the war, 
MRND has always been for a military solution. [passage omitted] 
Meanwhile, the MRND and their allies elaborated a plan to 
physically eliminate opposition personalities and for that 
purpose, the army trained 2,000 MRND Interahamwe [pro-MRND 
militiamen], armed to massacre the population, instructed to do 
so when the time comes. By assassinating the president of the 
Republic, the hardliners of the past one-party regime MRND and 
the army wanted to create for themselves a golden opportunity to 
implement their plan of getting rid of the opposition political 
leadership and militants. [passage omitted]

situation in the conflict areas of the Northern Region is over 
and warned that anybody found taking the law into his or her own 
hands will be prosecuted. He said the task force is going

that any person who takes up arms against his or her neighbor 
will be charged with murder. Group Capt. Ayitey was addressing 
a delegation of the Anglican Church in Tamale who donated food 
and other items valued at 13.1 million cedis to the task force 
to assist in resettling the displaced persons. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos at the opening </F>
of the third session of the Council of Republic at the Futungo 
de Belas Palace in Luanda on 27 May -- recorded] 
  [Text] Distinguished members of the Council of the 
Republic, between our last meeting and today's, I asked for the 
distribution of a (?report) on the complex peace talks under way 
in Lusaka, for your information. The government and the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are 
holding peace talks in Lusaka with a view to establishing peace 
and national reconciliation. 
  I decided to convene this meeting because, despite the 
progress that is being observed, there is still a way to go. 
(?You are all aware) of the issues that remain to be discussed. 
Discussions on these important issues have not been easy. 
UNITA has been presenting concerns and at times adopting stands 
which openly go against the country's Constitution. If these 
positions are accepted, they would disenchant all the Angolan 
people who believed and continue to believe that it is possible 
to establish in the country a true multiparty democracy, without 
setting conditions of ethnical, regional, or racial nature. 
  Our immediate objective is to achieve a just and lasting 
peace to end the suffering of the Angolan people. For this 
reason we have been adopting an open and tolerant stand, which 
does not senselessly bank on contradictions and 
misunderstandings but which will on the contrary contribute to 
draw up our common future here in Angola, within the framework 
of a patriotic and constructive spirit. Under the present 
circumstances, we do not think it makes sense to opt for radical 
solutions that will exclude part of our people -- no matter how 
small that part is -- or even some of its representatives from 
the democratic game or the tasks of reconstruction and national 
development. 
  We want to obtain an understanding that will benefit all the 
Angolan people. We still have very many difficult and delicate 
issues on the working agenda. They include the situation of the 
Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel, the reinstatement of 
state administration in occupied areas, Jonas Savimbi's status, 
the role of the Joint Political and Military Commission, and so 
on. 
  I am convinced that in view of this reality, the 
distinguished members of the Council of the Republic will be 
able to present views and give advice, as has been the case in 
previous occasions. In your reflections, it is probable that 
you could have the South African process as a point of 
reference. The South African process is truly a good example. 
All the same, it is important to know that it is a different 
country, with problems which are also very different from ours. 
The lessons that the Angolan people can draw from their 
experience is that all the protagonists of the political process 
abandoned violence and war as a means of politics. When UNITA 
decides to embrace this example there will be peace in Angola. 
There is a need to force UNITA to end the war. This could be 
done through strong pressure from the international community or 
through our military or political pressure. 
  Also with regard to South Africa, I would like to take this 
opportunity to inform you that our foreign minister will soon 
meet with the new South African foreign minister to discuss 
issues of common interest to the two countries. He is not going 
to request South Africa's participation in the negotiating 
process between the Angolan Government and UNITA, since this 
process has already been defined within the framework of the 
Bicesse Accords. The foreign minister will make the first 
attempt to establish general foundations for a broad and 
multifaceted cooperation with mutual benefits. 
  As you are aware, the past has been characterized by wars of 
aggression on one side and solidarity on the other. We want to 
bury all that was negative and validate what was positive, but 
history must be assumed by all of us. South Africa has 
obligations toward Angola, resulting from some resolutions of 
the UN Security Council. 
  In conclusion, I would also like to inform you that I 
recently sent a letter to His Excellency President Bill Clinton 
of the United States. The letter was in reply to his promise of 
concrete guarantees, within the framework of the United Nations, 
for a strict implementation of an eventual agreement that could 
be signed in Lusaka. In the letter, I expressed my desire to 
consult all opinion sectors in the country to obtain a minimum 
consensus to allow the government to adopt a decision relating 
to some of the suggestions of the mediators, in conditions of 
some political stability. 
  These are just some of the actions that we are undertaking 
to 
achieve peace. It is only in a climate of peace and 
reconciliation that the government's economic and social program 
can finally halt the serious crisis facing the country. The 
program, now in the implementation phase, has received praise 
from international financial organizations for the courage and 
realism demonstrated. Thus, we could begin to find a solution to 
the pressing problems facing our people, by stabilizing the 
national currency, enhancing the value of our salaries, making 
investments viable, and resuming economic growth. We have, 
through concrete actions, to guarantee our people's confidence 
in the existing institutions and reinstate the authority of the 
organs of sovereignty at all levels to prevent our newly 
established democracy to be subverted by the opportunism and 
ambition of those who place their personal interests above the 
interests of the people and the nation. I count on your 
contribution. 
  I thus declare officially open this third session of the 
Council of the Republic.

  [Text] Cape Town May 26 SAPA -- Six thousand members of the 
Pan Africanist Congress' [PAC] armed wing, the Azanian People's 
Liberation Army [APLA], would be included in the South African 
National Defence Force [SANDF], PAC President Clarence Makwetu 
said after meeting President Nelson Mandela on Thursday. The 
number could rise to 10,000, he said. Speaking on the steps of 
Tuynhuys after their meeting, Mr Mandela said he had asked the 
PAC leader for a list of PAC members who could be included in 
the new government's civil service and diplomatic corps. Mr 
Mandela said APLA members had fought and suffered. They should 
be included even though they applied for membership after the 
cutoff date for inclusion of non-statutory forces in the SANDF. 
  Mr Mandela said his discussions with Mr Makwetu were part of 
an ongoing attempt to forge unity. "As long as I am president, 
I think this dialogue should continue," Mr Mandela said. "We 
are busy on an initiative intended to bring about a unified 
approach in dealing with questions which are of concern to the 
people of South Africa." He was encouraged by the co-operation 
he was receiving from other political parties. 
  On Wednesday, Mr Mandela met Conservative Party leader Ferdi 
Hartzenberg and next week he will meet Afrikaner 
Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene 
Terreblanche. 
  Before meeting Mr Makwetu, Mr Mandela held an hour-long 
meeting with acting democratic party leader Tony Leon. Mr 
Mandela said he welcomed a loyal parliamentary opposition. "The 
fact that people differ with us is no reason why we should not 
give attention to their ideas. The role of the opposition is to 
draw attention to those things we may not be alive to."

<F P=106> [Statement by Mr Derek Hanekom MP, minister of land affairs </F>
and chairman of the cabinet committee on the Ingonyama Trust 
Act; issued by the Ministry of Land Affairs on 26 May on the 
SAPA PR Wire Service] 
  [Text] The cabinet committee appointed to investigate, 
report and make recommendations on the background, reasons for 
the implications of the Ingonyama [King's] Trust Act, has met 
for the second time today. 
  A committee of experts has been appointed to assist the 
cabinet committee in its investigations. Prof Harriet Ngubane 
MP, Attorney Geoff Budlender (director of the Legal Resources 
Centre), Adv Pius Langa SC [Senior Counselor] (Durban Bar and 
president of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers) and 
Mr Erik Buiten (chief director of the Department of Regional and 
Land Affairs) are serving on the technical committee. Further 
assistance is being provided by the Department of Regional and 
Land Affairs. 
  The cabinet committee will inform cabinet on 1 June 1994 of 
steps taken and the progress being made in the investigation. It 
is envisaged that the final report and recommendations will be 
presented to cabinet on 14 June 1994. 
  In conclusion, there seems to be some confusion regarding 
the 
extent of land which may be subject to the Ingonyama Trust, in 
terms of the KwaZulu Ingonyama Trust Act. Approximately 
3,070,000 hectares of former sa development trust land was 
transferred in terms of the above act, all situated within the 
jurisdiction of the former KwaZulu Legislative Assembly. 
  This includes all of the land within KwaZulu, except the 
following: tribally owned land of some 8,000 ha; privately owned 
land of some 153,000 ha; the land described in Schedule 4 of 
Proclamation R28/1992 of 41,500 ha, and the former SA 
Development Trust Land situated outside KwaZulu (i.e. Makatini 
Flats, Goodluck Farms, Ntambanana Farms, Impendhle Farms, Platt 
Estates area, Highflats Farms, Gundrift Farms, Margate Corridor 
Farms, Meringa Flats, Gingindluvu Farms). 
  It could be mentioned that the majority of land transferred 
in terms of the Ingonyama Trust Act had been occupied by tribes 
and communities since before 1913. This category of land 
consists of some 2,300,000 ha, previously referred to as the 
Zululand reserves. 
  In the interest of an open and accountable process, 
submissions by interested parties will be welcomed. However, due 
to the urgency and sensitivity of the issue, submissions can 
only be accepted until midnight on Wednesday, 1 June 1994. 
Submissions on the Ingonyama Trust Act and its implications can 
be faxed to the Ministry of Land Affairs at (012) 211-244.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Meles Zenawi on the third anniversary </F>
of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, EPRDF, 
at Meskel Square in Addis Ababa--live] 
  [Excerpts] Dear Ethiopian people, I would like to express 
my heartfelt pleasure on this auspicious third anniversary of 
peace and democracy, which has come at a time when we are close 
to establishing a lasting democratic system, and when we have 
reached the last phase of the transitional period. [passage 
omitted] 
  The registration of voters and candidates for the 
Constituent 
Assembly has been carried out, and candidates are already in the 
process of campaigning, with the help of the government media. 
The necessary documents, ballot boxes, and the process for 
transporting them is successfully underway. It is expected that 
the elections will be carried out fairly, freely, and in a 
democratic manner, in the presence of local and international 
observers. 16 million people have already been registered as 
voters, out of the 22 million who are eligible to vote, so 
around 72 percent of our eligible voters have registered. 
[passage omitted] 
  What remains now is the process by which the people will 
elect those who will represent them in the Constituent Assembly. 
  A Constitution will be adopted by the Constituent Assembly, 
and a new democratic government, based on this Constitution, 
will be set up. this process is expected to be finalized by the 
middle of next year. [passage omitted] 
  The government has taken steps to improve production in the 
trade and industrial sectors. Those obstacles which had been 
hindering the development of the economy's industrial sector 
have been removed, and government institutions have been 
encouraged to operate at a profit through improved management. 
Our factories were saved from closure by being supplied with 
adequate foreign currency from the government for the purchase 
of raw materials. [passage omitted] 
  In this year's budget, the industrial sector has shown 9.9 
percent growth: trade and transportion have grown by 3.7 
percent, and the social services' sector has grown by 10.3 
percent. Although the amount of land under cultivation has 
increased by 11 percent, agricultural production has gone down 
by 5.2 percent, due to inadequate rainfall. Since the country's 
economy is dependent on agriculture, which in turn relies on 
long rains, if there is inadequate rainfall in one year it will 
not only affect the agricultural sector, but the entire national 
economy. [passage omitted] Moreover, more than 6.7 million 
citizens are faced with famine, and thousands of animals have 
been affected. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to extend my deepest gratitude, and that of the 
Ethiopian people, to various donor countries and nongovernmental 
organizations, for their relentless life-saving missions.

  [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today 
announced that the leaders of the three East African states, 
including Zaire, will meet soon over the strife in Rwanda. 
President Moi said neighboring states should not stand back and 
watch as many innocent lives are lost through the civil strife. 
  The president noted that the many problems currently facing 
the African continent are as a result of embracing foreign 
ideals without due understanding of what they entail. He 
reiterated that tribalism was an evil that had contributed to a 
lot of problems in Africa. 
  President Moi observed that Kenya achieved a lot in various 
sectors because of the peace and tranquillity that continued to 
be maintained since independence. He attributed the country's 
stability to the democratic principles that have continued to be 
practiced since independence. President Moi was speaking at 
Njumbi secondary school in Kangema Division of Murang'a 
District, where he helped to raise 6,662 shillings and five 
cents in aid of Kangema divisional bursary fund. [passage

  [Excerpt] Mohamed Farah Aidid, the chairman of the Somali 
National Alliance leadership council and of the United Somali 
Congress, USC, has met a UN delegation led by UN envoy Iqbal 
Riza. Mr. Aidid expressed his happiness with the delegation's 
visit and the meeting. He briefed members of the delegation on 
the overall situation in the country, saying that, peacewise, 
the country was fine. He explained that, since March, no 
interclan or intergroup fighting had taken place, though 
incidents of banditry had occurred here and there. Mr. Aidid 
said the United Nations Operation in Somalia had not delivered 
required goods, and said that it had only assisted a limited 
number of people. 
  On the formation of a police force, the chairman suggested 
it 
was important to speed up the creation of the police force, so 
that security was maintained throughout the country. Mr. Aidid 
said that progress had been made to reconcile Somali 
organizations during a number of conferences that had been held, 
the last one being in Nairobi in March, during which a peace 
declaration had been signed. 
  Mr. Aidid told the UN envoy that reparations should be paid 
for the damages caused by the five months of war, in which 
13,000 people were killed and 45,000 injured, and a lot of 
property destroyed. He said the injured and orphans should be 
cared for and rehabilitated. Mr. Aidid appealed to the 
international community to continue their humanitarian 
assistance to support the Somali people. He made it clear that 
foreign interference in Somalia was detrimental to the 
establishment of peace in the country, adding that Somalia 
should be left alone. Finally, Aidid commended UN Special 
Ambassador to Somalia Lansana Kouyate for his tireless efforts 
to bring about an end to Somalia's problems. 
  For his part, Iqbal Riza said efforts had been made to 
resolve Somalia's problems. He thanked the chairman for the 
warm welcome accorded to him and his delegation. [passage

  [Text] Nairobi, May 29 (AFP) -- A Nepalese peacekeeper 
abducted two weeks ago in an ambush that left five colleagues 
dead was freed Sunday [29 May], the United Nations said. 
  The peacekeeper was wounded during the clash but appears to 
be in satisfactory health, said a spokesman for the UN mission 
here, George Bennet. 
  Bennet said he had no details on the soldier's release, but 
that he believed the kidnappers received nothing in exchange. 
  The soldier was abducted from a Mogadishu hospital after the 
assault by Somali gunmen on May 16.

  [Text] A plot to launch a Muslim holy war in Liberia has 
been uncovered. A report from the Liberian capital Monrovia 
said Alhaji Koromah of the Mandingo faction of the ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] is planning to 
launch a Muslim holy war in Liberia and turn the country into an 
Islamic state. 
  The report said Koromah has mandated a delegation of the 
Mandingo faction currently touring Islamic states in the West 
African subregion to seek support for the venture. Koromah's 
delegation has already met Nigerian authorities on the 
replacement of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States 
Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, General Inienger, 
with a Muslim. ULIMO's representative to the Transitional 
Legislative Assembly, Mr. Morris Dukuly, is heading the 
delegation which is lobbying for the waging of the Jihad War in 
Liberia. 
  At the same time, the Liberia Council of Churches has called 
on an emergency meeting of its members to discuss the Alhaji 
Koromah's faction plan in Monrovia. The Liberia Council of 
Churches has condemned such an intent by the Koromah Mandingo 
faction and called for strong resistance to it.

  [Text] The fight for the control of ULIMO [United 
Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] headquarters at 
Tubmanburg has posed all sorts of problems to the Liberian peace 
process. 
  At the end of last week, the Mandingo faction of ULIMO, 
loyal 
to Roosevelt Johnson, launched an attack on Tubmanburg and took 
control of the city center, forcing Alhaji Koromah's Krahn 
faction to retreat to the western suburb. Shortly afterwards, 
an ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire 
Monitoring Group] convoy heading for Tubmanburg was ambushed and 
a group of soldiers were taken hostage. 
  On this program yesterday, ECOMOG field commander Major 
General John Inienger told us that, following negotiations with 
Alhaji Koromah, he had managed to secure the release of some of 
the ECOMOG soldiers, but that at least five others were still 
being held hostage. Well today, Alhaji Koromah called us up 
from Monrovia to give us his version of events for the last few 
days around Tubmanburg. On the line, Heather Saleh asked him 
what he had to say: 
  [Begin recording] [Koromah] Well, the first thing is that it 
is not true that we have lost Tubmanburg. Tubmanburg is under 
our full control, and you can ask UN and other sources. We just 
took a tactical retreat to the barracks, and then encircled the 
enemy, and then we have driven them out of the place -- and many 
of them have died. Of course, they were being assisted by 
ECOMOG artillery, especially the Nigerian contingent that is 
there. 
  [Saleh] You say Tubmanburg is under your control, but you 
have had to, in fact, move your headquarters away from 
Tubmanburg to Voinjama, and you said that the Krahns controlled 
the city center. 
  [Koromah] That was the first day. We moved our 
administrative headquarters to Voinjama because of the level of 
insecurity in the Tubmanburg area. The military headquarters is 
still there and that the city center area that was being 
occupied by the dissident forces. [sentence as heard] They are 
not only Krahn people, necessarily, OK? So, we have recaptured 
the city center. It is under our control now. You can ask the 
UN people. They will confirm that. 
  [Saleh] So according to you, there are no forces of 
Roosevelt Johnson in Tubmanburg now? 
  [Koromah] In the first place, these are not forces of 
Roosevelt Johnson. You know, this is misinformation. Johnson 
has only been a public relations officer for these forces, and 
he represents nothing. These are forces of General T. Kallah. 
These dissident groups have been driven away from Tubmanburg, 
and we are chasing them in the swamps and in the forest areas. 
But the question of Gen. Inienger telling us that we hijacked 
his vehicles, this is not true. He has been misinformed. These 
vehicles, when individual Nigerian soldiers were fighting along 
with the dissidents and they were captured, and we have three of 
them now, and they have been confessing the news of some of 
their higher ups who give them the command to get involved in 
this war. [sentence as heard] 
  [Saleh] But you do admit that you are holding a number of 
ECOMOG troops? 
  [Koromah] These people were captured along with the 
dissidents, and I have promised Gen. Inienger that they will be 
released very shortly. They were about 24 of them that we 
captured. We have released 21 of them, and the other three are 
being questioned to give us information, and they shall be 
released very shortly. 
  [Saleh] When did you regain Tubmanburg? 
  [Koromah] Yesterday. Yesterday. In fact, we never really 
left the entire city. It was just the city center, because we 
did not want the citizens to get caught in the crossfire. So we 
moved to the actual military barracks. [end recording]

  [Text] ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] militiamen in Liberia have released 11 out of the 16 
Nigerian soldiers they took hostage in an ambush last Friday [27 
May]. A spokesman for the ECOMOG [Economic Community of West 
African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] African Command said 
today that negotiations are going on for the release of the 
remaining five. The peacekeepers were captured during heavy 
fighting between the two rival factions of the ULIMO militia in 
the Tubmanburg area, 60 km northwest of Monrovia.

  [Text] Civilians in the Liberian town of Tubmanburg are in 
an increasingly desperate state because of the continued 
fighting between the Roosevelt Johnson and Alhaji Koromah 
factions of ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia]. Tubmanburg fell to Johnson's forces last week in the 
latest flare up of fighting, but Alhaji Koromah claims to be 
fighting back and there have been allegations that ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group] troops are helping the Johnson faction. And, as Nii 
Nartey Allison reports in this fax from Monrovia, there have 
been more clashes in Tubmanburg today: 
  UN officials said here today that the Mandingo and the Krahn 
factions were occupying the hills surrounding the city, and that 
no particular group appears to be in control of Tubmanburg 
center. According to one UN official, the situation changes 
every hour and it is quite desperate for the civilian 
population. The UN official said that at least 10,000 people 
have fled Tubmanburg and were now seeking refuge at the only 
government hospital and at the base camps of the African 
peacekeeping force. He added that there was no water and that 
food and medicine supplies were running out. He said that there 
was also a problem of shelter, with more people still flocking 
into the safe zone. A planned UN convoy carrying 21 metric tons 
of badly needed food and medicines, scheduled to have been 
escorted today into Tubmanburg by heavily armed African 
peacekeeping troops, is being delayed by the fighting.

  [Text] Charles Taylor, the leader of the National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia [NPFL], says he also has a problem with the 
Nigerians who have the biggest contingent in ECOMOG [Economic 
Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. 
His NPFL is currently fighting the Liberian Peace Council, LPC, 
in the southeast. Tonight, Mr. Taylor called us up from Gbarnga 
to complain about ECOMOG and he said the Nigerians were being 
less than helpful. On the line, Robin White asked him what the 
problem was. 
  [Begin recording] [Taylor] Well, Robin, the problem is that 
the LPC is organized and put together by the Nigerian part of 
ECOMOG here. There has been an intensification of the war in 
the Rivercess and Sinoe areas and it is traced directly to the 
Nigerians. We do not understand why the Nigerians, instead of 
making peace in Liberia, are just trying to exacerbate the 
situation. We just don't understand this, whether we should 
have to fight them now and the LPC or just continue with the LPC. 
  [White] Are you threatening to fight the Nigerians? 
  [Taylor] Well, I am saying that I don't know who the enemy 
is, and we have to fight the enemy and they appear to be the 
enemy. 
  [White] Well, how can you possibly say that? Surely, the 
Nigerians are there to try and bring peace. 
  [Taylor] Robin, everywhere in the world right now, the 
information is clear. We have POW's that testify that arms and 
ammunition are being given by the Nigerians. As you very well 
know, under the Security Council resolution there is an arms 
embargo on Liberia. Where else can a brand new group, external 
to the Cotonou [Accord], get sophisticated arms and ammunitions 
unless these rascals are selling them arms and ammunition? And, 
it is very aggravating. Liberians are dying here daily and the 
problem is no longer Liberians themselves. It is those that are 
here to keep the peace, and especifically the Nigerian 
contingent. 
  [White] Some people might say that the problem is that you 
are losing the war and you are looking for a scapegoat. 
  [Taylor] Robin, even if we were losing the war, we want to 
lose it in a very clear way. We are not losing the war, but the 
problem here is if you have people that say that they are 
peacekeepers and are just trying to make money by selling arms 
and ammunition and shedding the blood of Liberians, the question 
is: Will this crisis stop now or is it doomed to expand? And we 
are fed up with this particular situation and we may have to go 
after LPC wherever we have to go. 
  [White] How bad are things looking for you, militarily? 
  [Taylor] Not very bad, but the problem is the peacekeeprs 
should not be (?giving) arms and ammunition. Our officials are 
being harassed. They are being disrespected. They have no 
regard for this government here. I am not sure that these guys 
can do the job here, or if they should just pack up, and if I 
had a choice I think the Nigerians should think about leaving us 
alone because they have gone too far. [end recording]

  [Text] The UN special envoy to Liberia, Mr. Trevor 
Gordon-Somers, has been exposed for giving misleading 
information to the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia], regarding the definite timing of the 
deployment of Ugandan expanded ECOMOG [Economic Community of 
West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] troops to 
Maryland County and other parts of the southeastern region of 
Liberia. President Charles Gankay Taylor said Ambassador 
Gordon-Somers had misinformed the NPFL that the expanded ECOMOG 
was to have been deployed in Maryland County. This, he said, 
led the NPFL to send a team of senior military officers to 
Maryland to receive the ECOMOG troops, only to realize that the 
troops were not coming.

  [Excerpt] Citizens of Grand Bassa County have been meeting 
with the leader of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia 
[NPFL], Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, in Gbarnga, Bong County. At 
the meeting, the citizens expressed heartfelt thanks and 
congratulations to Mr. Taylor for defending the cause for which 
the people's popular uprising was launched. They expressed 
their commitment and loyalty to the leadership of the NPFL, and 
stressed that they will do everything possible to fully support 
the goals and principles of the Revolution. 
  In a petition to the former president of the NPRA [National 
Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly] Government, Mr. Charles 
Gankay Taylor, the citizens said the infiltration and taking 
over of compound numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 by the Liberian Peace 
Council in Grand Bassa County was masterminded by ECOMOG 
[Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring 
Group]. 
  According to the petition, under the disarmament process 
ECOMOG disarmed and encamped over 200 NPFL soldiers, without 
deploying troops of the expanded ECOMOG in those areas, thereby 
giving grounds to the self-styled Liberian Peace Council [LPC] 
to commit mayhem and atrocities in Grand Bassa County. The 
petition says towns and villages are being burned down to ashes, 
including [words indistinct], by forces loyal to the LPC, which 
is being aided and armed by the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG. 
At the same time, the citizens have appealed to local and 
nongovernmental organizations operating in the country to 
speedily deliver medical and relief supplies to the starving 
population in that part of the country. 
  Meanwhile, Mr. Taylor has set up a committee comprising of 
top military brass of the NPFL to work closely with chiefs, 
elders, and superintendents in the area to restore law and 
order. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African 
States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] field commander, Major 
General John Martin Inienger, says ECOMOG will discharge its 
mandate in Liberia thoroughly as provided for in the Cotonou 
accord. Gen. Inienger told a two-man UN delegation of electoral 
advisers that among such obligations was the need to disarm all 
the combatants in the Liberian crisis (?before) peaceful 
elections are held in the country. 
  Gen. Inienger reiterated that the parties to the conflict 
should demonstrate sufficient good faith by ensuring that the 
disarmament process is quickly ended to create an enabling 
environment for free and fair elections to be held. Gen. 
Inienger expressed concern over the clear reluctance of the 
parties to disarm as fast as it had been anticipated when the 
date for the general elections was fixed. 
  An ECOMOG release says the field commander told the UN 
electoral advisers that ECOMOG, a multinational group of 
professional military men, has the responsibility of providing 
security for free and fair elections to be held, but noted that 
it was not within the scheme of duties of ECOMOG to determine 
for Liberians what electoral system would be most suitable for 
them to adopt in electing their leaders. 
  Gen. Inienger said what ECOMOG would be most delighted to 
experience would be the day Liberians would once again 
democratically elect their leaders as they had been doing since 
the last century. He observed that the parties to the conflict 
have not made the job of ensuring a healthy environment in 
Liberia any easier for ECOMOG due to the internal problems being 
faced by ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in 
Liberia] and fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the 
NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeastern 
Liberia. 
  Gen. Inienger said he hoped that those problems would be 
solved and disarmament concluded before the 7 September date 
fixed for the general elections. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] The Federal Government has advised critics of the 
administration not to take its posture of reconciliation as a 
sign of weakness. Briefing State House correspondents in Abuja, 
Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya said government believed that 
the situation in the country required restraint by everyone. 
The chief of general staff also spoke on some other crucial 
issues including the interpretations the media gave to the 
statement he made on corruption. State House correspondent 
Haruna Idriss has the details. 
  [Begin recording] [Idriss] The chief of general staff said 
the constitutional conference is an avenue for all Nigerians to 
come together and discuss the future of the nation. He said 
government does not intend to tamper with resolutions of the 
conference. 
  [Diya] We are prepared to subject ourselves to the will of 
the people. The desire of the people must prevail because this 
is a military regime and a military regime cannot say that it is 
wiser than the body of men and women who will come and discuss 
the problems of this country. You see, the only way I can 
answer this question is to propose that the decision will be in 
the interest of the people of this country, help its unity and 
preserve the territorial integrity of this country. As long as 
they are along these lines, the decisions of the conference will 
be very, very much respected. 
  [Idriss] On the various groups which have issued ultimata to 
government, Gen. Diya said government does not recognize such 
groups but tolerates them as individuals in the spirit of 
national reconciliation. Government, he said, is prepared to 
listen to reasonable demand but will deal with any group 
planning an insurrection against government. Gen. Diya also 
spoke on the issue of June 12 which he said was a national issue. 
  [Diya] It's a national problem. It's a national issue. We 
feel it's a national problem, and I think it will be wrong for 
any individual with partisan interest or any group of people to 
say it is their problem. It's a national problem. In fact, the 
government itself is an offspring of June 12. If the election 
itself had not been nullified, the government would not have 
been in place. 
  [Idriss] The briefing which was attended by principal 
officers of the general headquarters will now be a regular 
affair. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Eastern Mandate Union has reacted to the 
ultimatum given it by the Federal Government to clarify its 
[words indistinct] government. In a statement in Kaduna today, 
the chairman of the union, Dr. (Dele Cole), said the Union is 
not a political party but a forum which wants government to 
urgently address the political, social, and economic problems 
facing the country. The union said although it had a plan to 
form a political party in course of political process, it was 
aware of the current ban on partisan politics. Dr. (Cole) said 
the main concern of the Union was the general state of affairs 
in the country as reflected in the resolutions made at its 
meetings. The Federal Government yesterday gave the Union a 
24-hour ultimatum to state clearly the status of the body.

  [Text] Lagos, May 30 (AFP)--Moshood Abiola, the presumed 
winner of presidential elections annulled in Nigeria last June, 
has again vowed to form a government in the near future, defying 
the military regime. 
  In an interview with the magazine NEWS published Monday [30 
May], Abiola called on the junta of General Sani Abacha to stand 
down and said "I am fully ready to claim the mandate. I am 
ready for the worst." 
  "Nobody can stop me," the millionaire businessman from the 
Yoruba southwest said in a separate interview with Concord 
magazine. "We are dealing with people who are looters. They are 
not leaders. They are dealers and they must go." 
  A newly formed nationwide group of anti-government 
movements, 
the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), has told the 
government to hand over to Abiola by Tuesday, May 31, but the 
regime dismissed this as a "joke". 
  The military warned that it would tolerate no hindrance of 
its own plans for restoring civilian rule, beginning with a 
constitutional conference it plans for June 27. It has not 
detailed its programme for change any more than Abiola said how 
he planned to organise his "government of national unity." 
  NADECO and other pro-democracy movements called for a 
boycott of elections of delegates to this conference and few 
voters turned out in the last round on May 23, but observers 
said turnout was higher in Saturday's second round. No official 
indication of the outcome of the poll has been released. 
  In his interviews, Abiola personally critised Abacha, who 
seized power in November last year. 
  "Who is Abacha? The man didn't even pass the staff college," 
Abiola said. "Professionally, he shouldn't even have been a 
lieutenant-colonel. You do not become a lieutenant-colonel 
unless you have passed the staff college." 
  "You heard him read the budget (in January)," the 
presidential hopeful added. "It was obvious he didn't understand 
what he was reading. How can a nation of brilliant people like 
Nigeria be led by a man like that?" 
  Abiola was said on unofficial results comfortably to have 
won 
the June 12 poll, hailed as free and fair by international 
observers, until then junta leader General Ibrahim Babangida 
annulled it, alleging irregularities. 
  Babangida stepped down in August, handing over to an 
unelected civilian caretaker administration. It was this 
government that Abacha overthrew, going on to scrap all 
Nigeria's democratically elected institutions.

  [Text] The Federal Government has refuted a report by some 
newspapers that the Nigerian ambassador to the United States, 
Alhaji Zubeiru Kazaure, has resigned. In a statement yesterday 
in Abuja, the chief press secretary to the head of state, Mr. 
David Attah, described the report as a false and mischievous 
fabrication aimed at creating fear and insecurity in the minds 
of the people. He described the purported copy of Alhaji 
Zubeiru's resignation as a fraudulent forgery meant to cause 
confusion. Mr. Attah stated that Alhaji Zubeiru himself had 
written to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denying knowledge of 
the purported letter of resignation being speculated by one Mr. 
Akim Abiola. The chief press secretary warned those he 
described as saboteurs and political mischief makers to desist 
from acts capable of destabilizing the nation.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by CAR Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor in Lome on </F>
26 May; read by "Mr. Apevo"--recorded] 
  [Text] [Words indistinct] Following the naming of Edem 
Kodjo's government on 25 May, the CAR [Action Committee for 
Renewal] wishes to issue the following statement. The CAR has 
observed that: 
  1. In accordance with its 23 April statement, none of its 
members agreed to join Edem Kodjo's cabinet. 
  2. The presidential group holds more than 60 percent of the 
ministerial posts. 
  3. Four of the five most important ministerial posts, 
national defense, foreign affairs, interior, and security, are 
held by members of the presidential group. 
  The CAR is also surprised that Edem Kodjo continues to claim 
he belongs to the CAR-UTD [Togolese Union for Democracy] 
parliamentary majority and that he will implement the majority 
group's joint program. In fact, through his obstinacy to form 
his government in violation of the 26 March agreement, Edem 
Kodjo is dealing with a majority that is not the one that was 
chosen during the 6 and 20 February parliamentary elections. 
This is evident in the composition of his government. 
  Moreover, in order to mislead the people, Edem Kodjo, in his 
introductory statement during the naming of his cabinet, went to 
great lengths to point out that he accepted the prime minister's 
post to save the parliamentary majority. In the same 
introductory statement, Edem Kodjo concedes that his government 
did not meet the people's aspirations. 
  The CAR, therefore, thinks it is a matter of urgency to form 
a legitimate and credible government which reflects the wishes 
expressed by the people during the parliamentary elections and 
which will meet with the people's approval. 
  Issued in Lome on 26 May for the CAR by its chairman, Yaovi 
Agboyibor.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Why Has the U.S. President Met the Dalai Lama </F>
at This Time?"] 
  [Text] U.S. President Clinton and Vice President Gore met 
the Dalai Lama in the White House on Thursday [28 April], and 
they allegedly discussed Tibet's religious and cultural rights. 
  People will ask: Why has Clinton met the Dalai Lama at this 
time? 
  Let us consult a White House statement: "The United States 
cares about these problems, especially at a time when the United 
States is examining the conditions for extending China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status." 
  That is the reason! The U.S. Government once again wants to 
link trade with politics, treating Tibet's religious and 
cultural situations as a condition for extending China's MFN 
trading status. 
  Concerning the issue of extending China's MFN trading 
status, 
the U.S. Government truly has an endless list of things to link 
to it. Yesterday it wanted to link it to China's lawful handling 
of the cases of Han Dongfang and Wei Jingsheng; today it wants 
to link it to Tibet's religious and cultural conditions 
described by the Dalai Lama; and tomorrow and the day after 
tomorrow, perhaps, it will want to link it to Beijing's lawful 
handling of some criminals who jeopardize the country's security 
and interests. The United States likes to comment unduly on the 
internal affairs of other countries, and give instructions and 
orders; it has frequently used MFN status to harass and bully 
other countries. This is a total violation of the basic norms 
of international relations as well as an embodiment of power 
politics. 
  Not long ago, a British Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee report attacked the human rights situation in Tibet, 
and said that the Foreign Office was "deeply concerned" about 
Tibet's "human rights" as well as "culture and religion," and 
that "the world cannot turn a blind eye to the Tibet problem." 
Was it because the Dalai Lama was "encouraged" by this British 
report that he immediately rushed to the United States to 
"report" to Clinton? Or was it because Clinton wanted to 
coordinate with Britain and summoned the Dalai Lama for a 
"discussion?" If that was the case, then what tacit 
coordination! 
  Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Under the leadership 
of the CPC, it cast off its extremely backward feudal serf 
system and embarked upon a broad and bright road of freedom, 
happiness, and modernization; its society and economy has 
experienced earth-shaking changes, and its human rights 
situation has completely improved. 
  Respect for and protection of religious freedom is a basic 
policy of the Chinese Government. Departments at various levels 
in Tibet have seriously implemented this policy and have won 
praise from the broad masses of monks and people. During the 
period of the National People's Congress in March, a Living 
Buddha from Xigaze's Zhaxilhunbo Monastery said at a news 
conference for Chinese and foreign reporters: "The policy of 
freedom of religious beliefs currently practiced in Tibet is 
protected by the constitution. In recent years, Tibet has spent 
200 million yuan to repair its monasteries. At present, Tibet 
has more than 1,400 monasteries, which basically satisfy the 
Buddha-worshipping activities of the people in the localities." 
Whoever has visited Tibet can tell you that everywhere one can 
see long narrow flags with Buddhist Scripture written on them 
hung by believers, piled up Buddhist stacks, and -- both inside 
and outside the well-known monasteries -- crowds of believers 
who kowtow, turn the Buddhist wheels, and come for pilgrimage. 
  Education and culture are developing very rapidly in Tibet. 
The state has invested more than 1.1 billion yuan in developing 
education in Tibet. The government pays all the tuition fees 
for Tibetan students, from the time when they enter primary 
schools to the time they graduate from universities. Some 
primary and middle school students of Tibetan nationality are 
also provided with clothing, food, and accommodations. The fine 
traditions and culture in Tibet have been protected and have 
been able to develop. The Tibetan language is used throughout 
the region, Tibet's cultural relics are thoroughly protected, 
and its traditional customs are widely respected. Modern 
cultures and facilities are constantly coming into Tibet, going 
to the households of many Tibetan compatriots. 
  There is a world of difference between the new Tibet and the 
old one. No one can deny this. 
  It has been more than three decades now since the Dalai Lama 
fled the country. With the purpose of splitting the motherland, 
he has ignored the facts, fabricated lies, attacked China's 
Tibet policy, slandered the human rights situation in Tibet, 
instigated and planned disturbances in the Tibetan region, and 
vigorously preached "Tibetan independence." He has not changed 
his deeds after being persuaded repeatedly; rather, he has 
intensified his efforts. Now he has met Clinton. Can we 
believe that he has not slandered and created rumors about 
Tibet's religious and cultural conditions in front of Clinton? 
How pitiful if a U.S. President were to pick up several chicken 
feathers (lies) from the Dalai Lama and view them as tokens of 
authority for attacking China, or as a reference for when he 
decides whether to extend China's MFN trading status! 
  According to a REUTER report, despite repeated explanations 
and objections by the Chinese Government, the U.S. side still 
arranged for its President and vice president to meet the Dalai 
Lama. This indicates that the United States has drifted away 
from its commitment to regard Tibet as a part of China and has 
trampled upon the basic norm of "not interfering in the internal 
affairs of other countries" when handling international 
relations. 
  It goes without saying that businessmen in the United States 
are generally optimistic about the Chinese market. They are 
demanding stronger economic cooperation with China and an 
unconditional extension of its MFN trading status. If those in 
power in the United States ignore the wishes of the commercial 
circles and the overall interests of their country, and take the 
Dalai Lama's lies as a reference when deciding whether to extend 
China's MFN trading status, then -- as asserted by Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation -- "MFN 
status is two-sided; if the United States revokes China's MFN 
status, then China can also revoke the United States' MFN 
status. If a confrontation arises between China and the United 
States over MFN status, neither side will be a winner."

<F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>
  [Text] Morristown (New Jersey), 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice 
Premier of the State Council Zou Jiahua, who is now in the 
United States, visited the world-famous American Telephone and 
Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) and International Business Machine 
Company (IBM) on 28 April. He also attended signing ceremonies 
for cooperation agreements and memorandums between relevant 
Chinese departments and those two companies. 
  AT&amp;T, based near Morristown, New Jersey, is known as 
the top 
leader in world telecommunications technology. It has branch 
companies and business operations in over 140 countries and 
regions. The total number of its employees exceeded 380,000 and 
its business turnover topped $67 billion in 1993. 
  When arriving at the Bell Laboratory, which is called "The 
Jewel on the Crown" of this company, Zou Jiahua and his party 
were warmly welcomed by company's executives, director of the 
laboratory, and other staff members. Nobel laureate in Physics 
Dr. Arno Penzias, who is vice president of AT&amp;T and in 
charge of 
the company's research work, briefed the Chinese guests on basic 
research and new product development of the Bell Laboratory. 
Dr. (John Mayo), director of the laboratory, accompanied the 
Chinese guests to tour the sites of the laboratory where 
materials such as laser semiconductor, optical fiber, and 
submarine optical cable were developed. At noon, Zou Jiahua 
went to Park Ridge, headquarters of AT&amp;T, and met with Robert 
Allen, president of AT&amp;T. They attended a signing ceremony of 
an agreement in principle on implementing the memorandum for a 
comprehensive and long-term cooperation between China's State 
Planning Commission and AT&amp;T. They agreed that the signing of 
this agreement would lay a foundation for long-term and friendly 
cooperation between relevant Chinese departments and AT&amp;T. 
Allen 
said that AT&amp;T is striving to become China's "most reliable 
strategic cooperation partner" in the area of communications 
technology and computer. Zou Jiahua praised this company's 
consistent friendship toward China and expressed the hope that 
the pace of the development of such a cooperative relationship 
would "be further accelerated." 
  On the same afternoon, Zou Jiahua and his party traveled 
about 160 km by cars to White Plains in the State of New York 
and held talks with Louis Gerstner, chairman of IBM, and others. 
Both sides carried out in-depth discussion on technological 
cooperation. China's Ministry of Electronics Industry signed a 
letter of intent on technological cooperation with this company 
there. Gerstner expressed the hope that the signing of the 
letter of intent on cooperation would become a new starting 
point for cooperation between IBM and China and would contribute 
to the development of the United States and China.

  [Text] Ottawa, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a meeting with 
Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua in Ottawa on 26 April, Andre 
Ouellet, Canadian minister of external affairs, said: The 
Canadian Government is willing to expand and strengthen 
Canadian-Chinese ties. This will help promote world peace and 
security as well as develop world economy. 
  Ouellet said he believes friendly and cooperative ties 
between the two countries will reach a new level under joint 
efforts by both sides. He said he is looking forward to his 
visit to China this July. 
  Zou Jiahua said: China and Canada share a wide-ranging 
common interest in such aspects as preserving peace and 
stability in the Asia-Pacific region and other regions in the 
world, promoting regional economic cooperation, and improving 
human environment. The expansion of Sino-Canadian exchanges and 
cooperation in such fields as economics, trade, science, and 
technology conforms to the fundamental interest of peoples in 
both countries. 
  He said: By strengthening consultations and cooperation in 
international and regional issues, China and Canada will produce 
a positive impact on promoting peace and development in the 
world, particularly the Pacific region. He said: The Chinese

friendly and cooperative ties. 
  Sheila Copps, Canadian deputy prime minister and minister of 
environment, in the evening of 26 April gave a banquet in honor 
of Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and his entourage. In their 
speeches, Copps and Zou Jiahua emphasized that China and Canada 
could complement each other in economics and trade, and should 
therefore further strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Tang Yongxing (0781 3057 5281): "A </F>
Visit Promoting Sino-Canadian Economic Cooperation and Trade"] 
  [Text] Ottawa, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
wound up his 10-day visit to Canada. His visit has promoted the 
economic cooperation and trade between China and Canada and 
created an opportunity for further developing the bilateral 
relations. 
  Zou Jiahua was one of the two Chinese vice premiers who 
visited Canada over the past year. The visits to Canada by two 
Chinese leaders during the past one year show the importance 
China attaches to the development of the Sino-Canadian 
relations. Likewise, Canada also attaches great importance to 
Zou Jiahua's visit. 
  While Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Canada last May 
restored the momentum of development for the Sino-Canadian 
relations, Zou Jiahua's recent visit provided an opportunity for 
the leaders of the two countries to discuss ways to expand 
further the bilateral economic cooperation and trade for years 
to come. 
  During the visit, Zou Jiahua met with Prime Minister 
Chretien 
and all the principal members of the Canadian cabinet. A 
consensus among them is that the Sino-Canadian cooperation from 
now on will mainly be in the fields of infrastructure, such as 
electric power, telecommunications, transport, aviation, and 
petroleum and natural gas, as well as in service trade. 
  During Zou Jiahua's visit, the two countries signed four 
cooperation agreements on telecommunications. According to the 
agreements, the Canadian Government will extend a loan of 200 
million Canadian dollars (approximately $150 million) to China 
for the establishment of joint ventures and for scientific 
research projects. Zou Jiahua and Canadian leaders spoke highly 
of the four agreements. 
  During his visit, Zou Jiahua met with the governors of four 
Canadian provinces and held discussion with Canadian 
entrepreneurs. They showed great interest in expanding economic 
cooperation and trade with China, particularly in investment in 
China. 
  During his meeting with Prime Minister Chretien, Zou Jiahua 
pointed out: China and Canada are having an unusual opportunity 
to develop their relations, and a great deal can be done by the 
two countries to strengthen their mutually beneficial 
cooperation. Chretien said that both Canada and China are vast 
in area with abundant resources, each having its strong points; 
and there is a great potential for them to promote mutually 
beneficial cooperation. He believed that Zou Jiahua's visit 
would certainly promote further the economic cooperation and 
trade between Canada and China.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese scholar Li 
Zhibin has recently been appointed as the chairman of the 
Sino-American Computer and International Software Development 
Bilateral Committee. 
  This was announced here today by A. Nattrass, executive 
board 
member of the Sino-American Trade Development Council. 
  Li, an associate professor of the Institute of Software of 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was chosen from an impressive 
list of nominees from the United States and China. 
  Nattrass said that Li's appointment is a credit to the very 
high standard of expertise in China in the field of 
international software development. 
  Robert E. Goodman, chairman of the Sino-American Trade 
Development Council, said that the 12-member bilateral 
committee, composed of distinguished computer experts from both 
the United States and China, would play a vital role in 
advancing cooperation between the two countries in the field of 
international software and computer development. 
  The chairman also paid tribute to the Chinese Government's 
efforts and commitment to advancing technology to meet the needs 
of the computer age and said that U.S. business needs the 
Chinese to collaborate on mutually beneficial partnerships in 
the vital area of computer and software development. 
  At a press conference here today, Nattrass also said that 
the 
Sino-American Trade Development Council has recommended to 
President Bill Clinton to renew China's most favored nation 
(MFN) status unconditionally and permanently, and his council 
predicted that the United States would do so. 
  The Sino-American Trade Development Council was formed last 
year in Washington with a goal of helping set up cooperation 
between China and America in the fields of economic development, 
cultural understanding and business relations as well as 
bridging the gap between medium and small business enterprises 
of the two countries.

<F P=106> [By Wang Dongyun (3769 0392 0061): "China Punishes 21 </F>
Chinese and Foreign Enterprises Involved in Illegal Textile 
Transshipments"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou 10 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--This 
reporter has learned from the Fourth National Work Meeting on 
Cracking Down on Illegal Textile Transshipment Activities, which 
was held here today, that to date, the relevant departments of 
the Chinese Government had meted out severe punishment to 21 
domestic manufacturing plants and export enterprises and foreign 
enterprises involved in illegal textile transshipment. 
  It was learned that Chinese and foreign enterprises, namely 
the Dongmao Enterprise Company Limited of Shenyang City, the 
Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company of Fujian Province, and the 
Shifa Garment Company Limited and the Yongjia Garment Plant 
Company Limited of Shantou City in Guangdong Province were named 
public; exchanges with Hong Kong's Daguo Company and the ROK's 
Dongqing Trading Company Limited and Taiyuan Trading Company 
Limited have been banned; and the Shanghai office of Hong Kong's 
Linghua Company was closed down. 
  It was learned that since 1990, the U.S. side had presented 
the Chinese Government with a total of 69 cases of illegal 
textile transshipment and had asked the Chinese side to conduct 
comprehensive investigations into them. To date, the Chinese 
Government has given notice of the results of 47 investigations 
cases to the U.S. side through the U.S. Embassy in China. The 
remaining 22 cases are still under investigation. 
  Viewed from the results of the investigations, not many of 
the Chinese export or manufacturing enterprises really intended 
to bypass management quotas on textiles or to engage in illegal 
transshipments, and most of them were innocently involved. For 
example, they took part in illegal transshipments planned by 
businessmen in Hong Kong and other regions without knowing that 
such activities were illegal. Only a few lawless enterprises 
planned and carried out illegal textile transshipments, seeking 
exorbitant profits and ignoring the overall interests of the 
country. 
  Viewed from cases provided by the U.S. side and from the 
results of investigations conducted by the Chinese side, the 
range of enterprises involved in illegal transshipments is quite 
wide at present. These include enterprises engaged in three 
forms of import processing and compensation trade, 
foreign-invested enterprises, enterprises engaged in special 
foreign trade, representative offices of foreign businessmen in 
China, and manufacturing enterprises which are not authorized to 
take part in foreign trade. Since foreign-invested enterprises 
and township and town enterprises know very little about illegal 
textile transshipments, more problems are found among them. 
  The meeting reaffirmed that in stopping and cracking down on 
illegal textile transshipments, the Chinese Government would, as 
before, adopt a resolute stand and attitude, severely punish 
enterprises which are engaged in illegal transshipments, and 
take necessary measures to prevent the occurrence of this kind 
of illegal activity.

(0719 2885 2504)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
entrepreneurs delegation accompanying Premier Li Peng during his 
visit to four Central Asian nations had extensive contacts with 
the enterprise circles of the host countries during the visits 
and signed more than 20 cooperation documents, achieving 
fruitful results. 
  As of today, representatives of the five large enterprises 
who accompanied Premier Li Peng have signed four agreements, two 
contracts, and more than 20 letters of intent on economic 
cooperation in petroleum, natural gas, construction, metallurgy, 
textiles, electronics, and other industries. 
  At a recent meeting with the entrepreneurs' delegation, Li 
Peng said: This is the first time a Chinese entrepreneurs' 
delegation has accompanied a state leader on a foreign tour. 
This is a beneficial experiment: good results have been 
achieved and we may continue the practice. In developing 
economic and trade cooperation with Central Asian nations, 
Chinese enterprises should give play to their own strengths and 
fully use the resources of the countries with which they 
cooperate. Cooperation must be on a equal and mutually 
beneficial basis, and we must take reality into consideration 
and pay attention to the economic results of cooperation. 
  Li Peng also pointed out: We must pay special attention to 
the quality of Chinese export products and must prevent 
counterfeit, fake, and substandard products from entering 
Central Asian markets. At the same time, we should protect the 
Chinese people's legal business activities in the area and crack 
down on speculation and profiteering. 
  Li Peng stressed the importance of building a modern "silk 
road" between China and Central Asian countries, saying that, 
without a free transportation channel, it will be difficult to 
greatly develop economic and trade relations with these 
countries. 
  Zheng Hongye, head of the Chinese entrepreneurs' delegation 
and president of the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade; and persons in charge of China Construction 
Engineering Corporation, China Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Corporation, China Steel Industry Trade Group, China Textile 
Products Import and Export Corporation, and China Electronics 
Products Import and Export Corporation, who accompanied Premier 
Li Peng on his visit, jointly held a news conference this 
afternoon to brief reporters on their companies' trade talks 
results. 
  They unanimously said: Chinese and Central Asian countries' 
economies are highly complementary to each other and the 
potential for cooperation is huge. As the cooperation climate 
improves, the level and quality of cooperation gradually will be 
raised. Chinese enterprises should be farsighted in developing 
economic cooperation with these countries.

Relaxed Moment"] 
  [Text] Almaty, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Soon after the CAAC 
Boeing-767 special plane with Premier Li Peng and his party on 
board took off from Almaty, the atmosphere in the cabin became 
lively. 
  Over the last 10 days, Premier Li Peng had nearly 20 rounds 
of talks and meetings with leaders of the Central Asian nations; 
repeatedly met with the people from various circles of those 
countries; delivered speeches, signed documents, and met the 
press more than once there. The itinerary was quite tight. 
Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, who accompanied Premier Li 
Peng on the Central Asia tour and served as secretary general of 
the delegation, suggested a performance of talents by those 
present, obviously trying to create a relaxed atmosphere after 
the busy visit. Cabin attendant Zhang Chunxian was the first to 
respond to his suggestion and sang a song. 
  Premier Li Peng came to the rear section of the cabin. He 
thanked the comrades from various departments there and affirmed 
their endeavors during the visits to the four nations. At their 
request, he took the microphone and sang a song -- "Song of 
Guerrillas." Then, he joined his wife Zhu Lin in a duet on 
"Waves on the Honghu Lake" and "In the Yonder Place." The 
couple was followed by other comrades in talent performance, and 
the cabin was full of song and laughter, showing the success of 
the premier's visit to the four Central Asian countries and the 
satisfaction and joy of his entourage. 
  After the impromptu performance over the Tianshan Mountain 
came to an end, Premier Li Peng returned to the front cabin and 
immediately began to discuss work with Ismail Amat and several 
other members of his entourage. Four hours later from then, 
Premier Li Peng would be visiting Mongolia.

<F P=106> [Report over video by unidentified reporter; from the </F>
"National News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] Premier Li Peng has concluded his visits to four 
central Asian nations and Mongolia. As reporters covering his 
visits, we keenly realized the importance of and had to deal 
with the tight schedule of the visits. A special plane took us 
to various countries, and meetings, talks, delivering speeches, 
and signing agreements comprised a major part of Premier Li's 
daily life during the visits. Let us examine the agenda of one 
day of the visit -- from this agenda we can see how busy Premier 
Li was during the trip. 
  [Reporter begins to play a video tape on Li Peng's 
activities 
in Kazakhstan] On the morning of 26 April in Almaty, the 
capital of Kazakhstan, Premier Li Peng presented flowers at a 
monument dedicated to unknown martyrs. After that, Premier Li 
held talks for three hours with Kazakh President Nazarbayev, 
signed the historic Sino- Kazakh Border Agreement, and granted 
an interview to reporters. In the afternoon, Premier Li met 
with figures of Kazakhstan's enterprise circles, during which he 
set forth six principles for developing economic and trade 
cooperation between China and Central Asian nations. Following 
that, Premier Li called on Chinese embassy personnel in Almaty. 
In the evening, Premier Li attended a welcoming banquet hosted 
by President Nazarbayev and delivered a speech at the banquet. 
[as the reporter reads the report, video shows Li paying 
tribute to the monument, holding talks with Nazarbayev, signing 
the agreement, speaking to entrepreneurs, calling on the Chinese 
Embassy, and attending and speaking at the banquet in his honor] 
  Hard work has turned into fruitful achievements. More than 
20 meetings and talks during the trip have enhanced mutual 
understanding between China and the countries we visited and 
deepened the friendship between us, and two important speeches 
delivered during the tour have clearly set forth the principle 
for developing political and economic relations between China 
and Central Asian nations. The signing of several important 
agreements has laid a solid foundation for developing relations 
between China and the four Central Asian countries and Mongolia. 
[video shows Li Peng speaking and witnessing the signing of 
documents] 
  If there were any light moments during the tour, they must 
be 
the short [words indistinct] and cheerful laughter and singing 
on the special plane. [video shows Li Peng in plane, singing 
through a loudspeaker as other passengers clap hands] 
  Dear viewers, Premier Li Peng's visits have ended and his 
special plane is on the way home. But, the principle for 
developing relations between China and Central Asian nations is 
clearly set forth and our policy on developing economic and 
trade relations with these countries has won popular support. 
We hope that the flower of economic and trade relations will 
blossom perpetually and the tree of friendship will remain green 
forever.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 30 April editorial: "Strengthen </F>
Good-Neighborliness and Friendship and Promote Mutually 
Beneficial Cooperation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- During the warm spring 
when flowers are in full bloom, Li Peng, premier of the State 
Council, paid an official goodwill visit, by invitation, to 
Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, 
Kazakhstan, and Mongolia, bringing with him the Chinese people's 
profound friendship. His visit was a complete success, having 
attained the goals of enhancing understanding, developing 
cooperation, and promoting good- neighborliness and friendship. 
We would like to offer our warm congratulations. 
  Premier Li Peng's five-nation tour was an event of profound 
significance in the history of China's relations with those 
countries. During the visit, Premier Li Peng held several 
rounds of friendly and sincere talks and meetings with the 
leaders of the five countries, during which they conducted 
businesslike and realistic discussions on further developing 
bilateral relations. Relevant departments on both sides signed 
approximately 20 agreements or letters of intent. Premier Li 
Peng also had an in-depth exchange of views with the leaders of 
the five countries on regional and international issues of 
common interest, reaching a broad consensus in this respect. 
  Premier Li Peng's visit marked a new stage of development 
for 
China's friendly relations and cooperation with the five 
countries. Premier Li Peng and the leaders of the five countries 
shared the view that maintaining good-neighborly and friendly 
relations over the long term would benefit not only the peoples 
of their respective countries, but also stability and 
development in the region. China and the five countries are 
complementary to each other in the economic realm, and there are 
broad prospects for strengthening cooperation based on equality 
and mutual benefit. Both sides indicated that they would adopt 
positive and feasible measures to further enrich the substance, 
improve the quality, and expand the scope of mutually beneficial 
cooperation, particularly referring to measures aimed at 
encouraging entrepreneurs on both sides to increase contacts and 
develop various forms of multilevel economic cooperation and 
trade. The entrepreneurs traveling with Premier Li Peng 
concluded a set of agreements or letters of intent on 
cooperation with their counterparts in the four Central Asian 
countries. They also explored ways to further develop economic 
cooperation and trade. 
  Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev signed a 
Sino-Kazakh 
border agreement, which was a major event of historic 
significance for relations between the two countries. We firmly 
believe that the Sino-Kazakh border extending more than 1,700 km 
will become a bond of friendly cooperation and common 
prosperity. Both Premier Li Peng and President Akayev said they 
would assume a positive attitude toward resolving the border 
issue between China and the Republic of Kyrgyzstan through 
friendly consultation and negotiations at an early date. 
  Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that Premier 
Li 
Peng delivered an important speech in Tashkent, the capital of 
Uzbekistan, in which he systematically and comprehensively set 
forth a four-point basic policy for developing China's relations 
with the Central Asian countries. The speech elicited positive 
response and favorable comment. Remaining on friendly terms for 
generations represents the common aspiration of the Chinese and 
Central Asian peoples, and is entirely consistent with their 
fundamental interests. China attaches great importance to 
developing friendly relations with the Central Asian countries; 
respects their independence and sovereignty, the choice of 
social systems and development paths made by their peoples in 
keeping with their national conditions, and the foreign policies 
they pursue; and appreciates their efforts to develop relations 
with their neighbors and other countries. China abides by the 
principles of equality and mutual benefit, will develop economic 
cooperation and trade with the Central Asian countries to 
promote common prosperity, and will make due contributions to 
building a new "Silk Road." China sincerely hopes for stability 
and development in the Central Asian countries and region. A 
stable and prosperous Central Asia is in the long- term 
interests of Central Asian countries, and is closely related to 
peace and development in Asia and even in the world at large. 
We believe that with the passage of time, the four-point basic 
policy enunciated by Premier Li Peng will demonstrate strong 
vitality. 
  Since China and Mongolia normalized their relations in 1989, 
their relations have experienced new developments. During 
Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia, China and Mongolia signed a 
treaty of friendship and cooperation, an important hallmark of 
the development of relations between the two countries. The 
leaders of China and Mongolia expressed the identical view that 
the two countries should constantly consolidate and develop 
good-neighborly and friendly cooperation on the basis of the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence. 
  Developing relations with neighboring and adjacent countries 
is a very important part of China's independent foreign policy 
of peace. Regardless of what may happen in the world, China's 
policy of good-neighborly and friendly relations will never 
change, and China will always be a good friend and neighbor who 
can be trusted by adjacent countries. We firmly believe that 
through the joint efforts of China and the five countries, the 
results of Premier Li Peng's visit will surely be consolidated 
and expanded. China's good-neighborly, friendly, and mutually 
beneficial cooperation with adjacent countries is bound to be 
filled with even greater vim and vigor.

<F P=106> [Newsletter: "Neighbors Are Dearer Than Distant Relatives" </F>
by XINHUA reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Hu Xiaoguang 
(5170 2556 0342)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- "Neighbors are dearer 
than distant relatives." At a grand banquet to welcome visiting 
Premier Li Peng, President Nazarbayev used this proverb to 
figuratively and profoundly express aspirations of peoples of 
the two countries who are willing to be friendly for generations. 
  Situated at the northern foot of the Ili Mountain Range, 
Almaty City, with flourishing trees lining its streets, faces 
snow-capped mountains in the south. The national flags of China 
and Kazakhstan are fluttering in the wind along the city's major 
streets. It is a city that links Sino-Kazakh friendship. Both 
the ancient "Silk Road" and today's Eurasian Bridge pass through 
this vintage city. 
  Premier Li Peng and Kazakh leaders are writing a new chapter 
of Sino-Kazakh relations together with sincere words including 
"good-neighborliness, friendship, and cooperation." 
  In the past few days, Kazakh mass media have been using nice 
phrases, including "a great country" and "a friendly neighbor," 
to report on China's situation and Premier Li Peng's visit. 
FIELD OF VISION PAPER [shi ye bao 6018 6851 1032] hailed 
China's reform policy, claiming that "proceeding from specific 
national conditions and refusing to blindly copy other country's 
models" were an important experience of China's successful 
reform. KAZAKHSTAN INFORMATION PAPER [xiao xi bao 3194 1873 
1032] used the phrase "a new and important phase of Sino-Kazakh 
cooperation" as a headline to report on Premier Li Peng's visit. 
  The magnificent Kazakh presidential palace was particularly 
splendid under full view of the sun. However, people were more 
interested in the talks between Premier Li Peng and President 
Nazarbayev and in the agreements reached by both sides. Because 
of their friendly relationship and the extensive topics under 
discussion, the two leaders had to extend their talks one hour 
longer than originally scheduled. 
  Many reporters had come early and had been waiting at the 
agreement-signing hall. In addition to Chinese and Kazakh 
reporters, many Russian reporters and colleagues from THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS, REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, BRITISH 
BROADCASTING CORPORATION, and Turkish newspapers were present. 
A Kazakh Foreign Ministry official told the reporters: The 
mass media are paying very close attention to Premier Li Peng's 
visit. It is seldom that so many foreign reporters have come to 
Almaty to prepare news reports. 
  Naturally, the most important agreement reached by both 
countries was the border agreement. Around noon, Premier Li 
Peng and President Nazarbayev, full of smiles, entered the 
agreement-signing hall together. While cameras continuously 
flashed, they raised their pens and signed the Sino-Kazakh 
border agreement. Both Premier Li Peng and President Nazarbayev 
spoke highly of the agreement, saying that "the signing of the 
agreement has historic significance in Sino-Kazakh relations and 
is an important indicator of the development of good-neighborly 
and friendly relations between the two countries." 
  Kazakh Prime Minister Tereshchenko, who was recuperating in 
Moscow, hurriedly returned to Almaty solely to welcome visiting 
Premier Li Peng. With a cane in hand and together with Premier 
Li Peng, he climbed up to a rostrum in the Almaty Business 
Center's Conference Lounge. Several hundred Kazakh economic and 
trade officials and entrepreneurs earnestly listened to Premier 
Li Peng at the lounge on developing economic and trade relations 
between China and Central Asia. A coal mine expert said: "We 
fully agree with Premier Li Peng's speech where he stressed 
mutually beneficial cooperation. The two countries share 
1,700-odd km of common boundaries and have been maintaining 
traditionally friendly relations. There are natural conditions, 
including favorable opportunities and locales, for us to carry 
out economic and trade cooperation." 
  During an interview with the reporters, Kazakh Ambassador to 
China Auezov indicated: Premier Li Peng's visit is the first 
visit by a ranking Chinese leader to Kazakhstan since its 
independence. It is very important politically and 
economically. A Kazakh friend likened the current Sino-Kazakh 
relations to a vigorously growing tree of friendship. He said: 
Under the utmost careful cultivation of leaders and peoples of 
the two countries, the tree will bear abundant fruit.

  [Text] Moscow, May 1 (XINHUA) -- About 50,000 Muscovites 
today rallied peacefully in the Russian capital to mark May Day, 
and some chanted anti-government slogans. 
  At 09:00 Moscow time (06:00 GMT), about 25,000 people 
started 
the celebration Marching along Moscow's central Tverskaya Street 
from Triumfalnaya (Triumph) Square to rally on Manezh Square 
near the Kremlin. 
  The parade accompanied by two orchestras was organized by 
the 
Federation of Labor Unions. 
  Addressing the rally, Mikhail Nagaitsev, chairman of the 
Moscow Federation of Labor Unions, urged the government to 
introduce a legislative bill making the withholding of salaries 
and wages a crime, to index salaries to inflation rate and adopt 
a state employment program, as well as intensify the work of 
law-enforcement bodies in their fight against crime and 
corruption. 
  "We are in favor of (the civic) accord and civic peace, but 
not at the expense of the working people, of depriving the 
common people of their rights," he said. 
  One hour later, another parade, sponsored by the Russian 
Communist Party and other political parties, marched practically 
along the same route. It also held a meeting on Tverskaya 
Square, with nearly the same number of demonstrators. 
  At 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT), about 20,000 demonstrators 
rallied on October Square holding anti-government banners and 
slogans. 
  The demonstration was called by the Liberal-Patriotic Party 
Renewal along with the Russian Communist Workers' Party (RCWP), 
and the All-Russia Communist Party of Bolsheviks. 
  The RCWP leader Viktor Anpilov appealed over loudspeaker for 
a nationwide political strike scheduled for early October. He 
stressed the need to rebuild socialism in Russia. 
  After their first meeting, the demonstrators, which were 
joined by Russian Communist Party leader Anatoliy Zyuganov and 
former Soviet speaker Anatoliy Lukyanov, marched toward 
University Square at 11:45 Moscow time (8:45 GMT) for an 
additional meeting there. 
  The current labor day coincides with the easter Sunday in 
Russia, and also with the one-year anniversary of a bloody 
conflict between demonstrators and police in Moscow. Over 150 
people were injured in the clash.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, 
said here today that China desires to further enhance its 
cooperation with Japan. 
  Meeting with Bunbei Hara, president of the House of 
Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and his wife and their party, 
Qiao said China and Japan are close neighbors, adding: "We are 
pleased to note that the two countries have enjoyed very good 
relations." 
  The two countries have exchanged frequent visits and 
conducted a wide range of exchanges in the fields of politics, 
economy and culture, he said. 
  Qiao said the constant strengthening of bilateral friendship 
and cooperation will be an important contribution to peace in 
the Asia-Pacific region as well as the rest of the world. 
  Looking towards the 21st century, he said, the influence 
exerted by such friendship and cooperation will become greater, 
adding that "It is our hope that an unpleasant period in history 
will never appear." 
  Referring to China's economy, Qiao said that over the past 
few years, China has accelerated its economy. But there still 
exists a gap between China and Japan in the level of development 
because China, as a vast country with a large population, cannot 
experience development all at once. 
  China is willing to further its cooperation with Japan 
although it will mainly rely on its own efforts in its economic 
development and do its utmost to develop its economy under a 
stable environment. 
  He stressed that it is of great importance for China to 
conduct varied ways of cooperation with countries all over the 
world including Japan. 
  Hara said he was particularly glad to visit China for the 
first time. 
  He said China has a history of several thousand years which 
has exerted a great influence on Japan's culture. 
  At present, he said, China is implementing the policy of 
reform and opening to the outside world, and its economy has 
grown quickly. 
  He expressed the hope that both Japan and China will advance 
hand in hand and further push forward bilateral ties and 
exchanges and cooperation between the Japanese House of 
Councillors and Chinese NPC. 
  Hara, aged 81, mentioned the unfortunate period in the 
history of Sino-Japanese relations, stressing that it is 
imperative for Japan to earnestly search its soul in this 
regard. Aside from this, the most important thing for Japan to 
do is to look towards the future and develop its cooperation 
with China. 
  During the meeting, Hara invited Qiao to visit Japan. Qiao 
thanked him for the invitation. 
  This evening, Qiao gave a dinner in honor of Hara and his 
wife and their party. 
  Present at the two occasions were Qiao's wife Yu Wen, and 
Wang Bingqian and Cao Zhi, respectively vice-chairman and 
secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee. 
  Hara and his party arrived here this afternoon for an 
official goodwill visit to China as Qiao's guests. They will 
also tour Xian, Shanghai and Suzhou after their visit in Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 KYODO -- Chinese Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen indicated Friday [29 April] that China is not 
well-informed on North Korea's nuclear development program 
despite its friendly ties with Pyongyang, Japanese officials 
said. 
  Qian told a Japanese delegation led by House of Councillors 
President Bunbei Hara that China does not know for sure for what 
purpose North Korea is trying to develop nuclear facilities, the 
officials said. Qian said he cannot determine whether North 
Korea wants to use the facilities peacefully or develop nuclear 
weapons, or to use the nuclear issue as a means of improving 
relations with the United States, according to the Japanese 
officials. 
  North Korea has been accused of trying to develop a nuclear 
arsenal and of refusing to accept full inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  Qian also said that as the North Korean nuclear issue has 
had 
effects on Japan and South Korea particularly, China will try to 
find a solution through dialogue, the officials said. The 
foreign minister, noting Pyongyang's dissatisfaction with 
China's establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea, 
said Beijing set up ties with Seoul so as not to isolate North 
Korea, the officials said. 
  Meanwhile in Vienna, an IAEA spokesman on Friday denied 
reports from South Korea that the international nuclear watchdog 
has shown willingness to compromise with the North on the 
contents of inspections in a letter to Pyongyang. The IAEA has 
not changed its stance of not sending any inspectors unless 
Pyongyang agrees to full inspections, the spokesman said. 
  According to the reports from South Korea, the IAEA informed 
North Korea it would send inspectors on condition that an 
important radiation measurement be conducted at a key nuclear 
facility at a later date.

<F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Chang Wanrong </F>
(1603 8001 7127)] 
  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and 
Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray held talks at the 
state palace on the morning of 29 April and exchanged in-depth 
views on issues including bilateral relations. 
  The talks were held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. At 
the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng said he was pleased to 
have the opportunity of visiting Mongolia on the occasion of the 
45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations 
between China and Mongolia. He evaluated highly the 
Sino-Mongolian exchanges and cooperation in the political, 
economic and trade, science and technology, cultural, and 
military fields. He said that China and Mongolia share a long 
border, that Mongolia is China's important neighbor, and that 
China attaches importance to friendly and good-neighbor 
relationship with Mongolia. 
  Li Peng said the Chinese Government will abide by the 
following five basic points in developing relations with 
Mongolia: 
  First, adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful 
Coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly 
cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century. 
  Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice 
of their own path of development. 
  Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the 
basis 
of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common 
development and prosperity. 
  Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East 
Asia; appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard 
regional peace and stability; and support for Mongolia's policy 
to become a nuclear-free zone, in not allowing foreign troops or 
the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons or other 
weapons of mass destruction in or through its territory. 
  Fifth, the Chinese Government is also willing to see 
Mongolia 
develop friendly relations with other countries. 
  Li Peng said that the consolidation and development of Sino- 
Mongolian friendly relations is not only in keeping with the 
fundamental interests of the two peoples but also will be 
conducive to regional peace, stability, and development as well. 
  Li Peng said that the "Friendship and Mutual-Assistance 
Treaty Between China and Mongolia" that was signed during 
Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia in 1960 laid a foundation 
for the development of relations between the two countries. Now 
both the domestic situation in the two countries and the 
international situation have undergone great changes. Taking 
Mongolia's wishes into consideration and with a view to further 
developing the friendly relations between China and Mongolia, 
both sides have revised and perfected the treaty. Today we will 
officially sign a new treaty of friendship and cooperation. He 
said that the signing of this treaty will be an epoch-making 
event in the history of bilateral ties. It will legally 
establish the relationship of friendship and cooperation between 
China and Mongolia. It will provide a new political basis for 
future bilateral relations. It will also be a basic principle 
for standardizing the handling of various bilateral affairs 
between the two countries. This treaty will make China and 
Mongolia even better friends and neighbors. 
  Jasray extended a warm welcome to Li Peng's visit. He said 
that he agreed with Premier Li Peng's assessment of bilateral 
ties. He said that Li Peng's significant visit coincides with 
the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Mongolia and China. The Mongolia Government 
assesses highly China's major achievements in developing the 
economy and in improving the people's living standards. A 
stable and developing China and a China that is embarking on 
reform and opening up is important for peace and stability in 
Asia, in the Pacific, and in the world. 
  Jasray said that Mongolia's foreign policy is based on the 
principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the 
beliefs or size of a country. The development of friendly 
relations with China and Russia, two large neighbors, is a 
priority of Mongolian foreign policy. Mongolia will not only 
develop relations with the Western and developed nations but it 
also will strive to expand ties with Asian countries, in 
particular those of East Asia. 
  Li Peng welcomed Mongolia's adoption of the policy of 
attaching importance to its ties with China and Russia. 
  Jasray said that thanks to the efforts of the two 
countries, relations between Mongolia and China have been 
completely normalized and constantly developed and expanded in 
recent years. The maintenance of high-level contacts between the 
two countries has promoted the mutual trust between the two 
countries and the two peoples. China's respect for Mongolia's 
chosen method of development is very important for the further 
expansion of friendship and cooperation between the two 
countries. He pointed out that the Friendship and 
Mutual-Assistance Treaty signed by the two countries in 1960 and 
the joint communique of 1990 have played a positive role in 
developing relations between the two countries. Today the two 
countries will also revise and sign a new treaty of friendship 
and cooperation. This treaty will surely become a legal basis 
for long-term development of the friendly and cooperative 
relations between Mongolia and China. Mongolia and China 
already have signed a number of agreements on cooperation and 
will sign more agreements on cooperation today. Therefore, the 
development of Mongolian-Chinese relations will surely be very 
smooth, which is in accord with the fundamental interests of the 
two countries. 
  When touching on the economic and trade cooperation 
relations 
between the two countries, Li Peng said that the trade 
relationship between China and Mongolia is developing very 
rapidly, that bilateral trade is basically balanced, that the 
two countries have signed a number of working-level agreements, 
and that both countries have opened many border posts. China 
has become Mongolia's second-largest trading partner. China is 
willing to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with 
Mongolia. In the area of economic cooperation, the two 
countries may set up joint venture, establish enterprises in 
each other's country, and further expand the sphere of 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  Jasray said that Mongolia attaches importance to developing 
trade relations with China and that he hopes the two countries 
will further discuss ways and areas for enhanced cooperation. 
He said that Mongolia also hopes to strengthen cooperation with 
China in the area of investment and to make joint efforts so 
that the cooperation between the localities and enterprises of 
the two countries will become more effective. He added that 
because Mongolia is a landlocked country, it is important to 
solve the transportation problem when developing economic and 
trade cooperation relations between the two countries. Mongolia 
is willing to make continued efforts to improve and enhance 
conditions in this regard. 
  Jasray appreciated Li Peng's support for Mongolia becoming a 
nuclear-free zone. He also expressed satisfaction over the good 
cooperative relations between the two countries in the cultural 
and other fields. 
  Jasray said that the Mongolian Government and people 
appreciate the Chinese Government's understanding of their 
economic difficulties and the economic assistance that China has 
provided to Mongolia. 
  Jasray reaffirmed that the PRC is the sole legitimate 
government of China, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of 
China's territory, and that the Mongolian Government will not 
enter into any official relations with Taiwan. Premier Li Peng 
expressed appreciation for this stand. 
  Li Peng extended an invitation to Jasray to visit China at 
his convenience, an invitation which Jasray accepted with 
pleasure.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Mongolian 
President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here today that the treaty 
on friendly relations of cooperation to be signed between China 
and Mongolia later today will lay a legal basis for bilateral 
relations through the next century. 
  The president made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, who came here Thursday [28 April] for a two-day 
visit. 
  Li Peng conveyed friendly greetings to Ochirbat from Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and extended Jiang's invitation for him to 
visit China. 
  Li told Ochirbat that his talks this morning with Mongolian 
Premier Puntsagiyn Jasray were fruitful and that he was 
satisfied with them. 
  China and Mongolia are neighbors and they should maintain a 
friendly relationship, Li said. 
  He called the treaty on friendly relations of cooperation to 
be signed later today "a major event in the annals of 
Sino-Mongolian relations" and said China is willing to have 
friendly and good-neighborly ties with all its neighbors, 
including Mongolia. 
  President Ochirbat said there is no unresolved issue of 
principle between Mongolia and China. As to some minor 
problems, the two countries will be able to solve them under the 
principle of mutual respect, he added. 
  The president said Mongolia attaches great importance to 
Premier Li's visit and regarded it as a continuation of contacts 
between leaders of the two countries. The visit will have a 
major significance to the development of bilateral relations. 
  He stressed that Mongolia supports China's foreign policies, 
especially its proposal for the establishment of a new 
international political and economic order. 
  China is a country of world influence, therefore, its 
proposal will have a major significance for maintaining peace 
and stability in the region as well as in the world, he said. 
  Premier Li Peng said the Chinese Government supports the 
policies carried out by the Mongolian Government on maintaining 
regional peace and security. 
  China respects the independence of other countries as well 
as 
their choices of their own political and economic systems. 
  He believed that relations between China and Mongolia in 
political, economic and other fields will further develop.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Mongolian President 
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat cordially met at the State Palace on the 
afternoon of 29 April with Chinese Premier Li Peng, who is 
currently on a visit to Mongolia. 
  During the meeting, the two leaders joyfully recalled their 
meeting in Beijing in 1990. Li Peng conveyed President Jiang 
Zemin's cordial regards to President Orchirbat and his 
invitation to President Orchirbat to visit China. Li Peng said: 
China and Mongolia are neighbors and therefore should maintain 
friendly relations. Over the last few years, many changes have 
taken place in both countries. China is developing a socialist 
market economy and we fully respect the development path 
Mongolia has chosen. Today we will sign a treaty on 
Sino-Mongolian friendly and cooperative relations. This is an 
event of great significance in the history of Sino-Mongolian 
relations. China is willing to maintain friendly and neighborly 
relations with all its neighbors, including Mongolia. 
  Orchirbat said: There are no unresolved issues of principle 
between Mongolia and China. As for some minor problems, the two 
countries can resolve them in a friendly manner on the principle 
of mutual respect. He added: "We attach great importance to 
Premier Li Peng's visit to Mongolia. The visit is a 
continuation of the increase of contacts between the leaders of 
the two countries, and has great significance for the 
development of Mongolian-Chinese relations. It is especially 
significant that a treaty on Sino-Mongolian friendly and 
cooperative relations will be signed during your visit. The 
treaty will not only reflect the relationship that has existed 
between China and Mongolia, but also will lay a legal foundation 
for the relationship between the two countries in the next 
century. I am satisfied with the continuing development of 
Sino-Mongolian relations and hope these relations will continue 
to develop -- this is also the wish of the Mongolian people." 
  Orchirbat said: The Mongolian Government and people 
congratulate China for the achievements it has made in carrying 
out reform and opening up and in improving the Chinese people's 
living standards. Mongolia supports China's foreign policy, 
especially its advocation to build a new international political 
and economic order. China exerts important influence on world 
affairs; therefore, China's foreign policy has great 
significance for preserving regional and world peace and 
stability. Developing Mongolian-Chinese and Mongolian-Russian 
relations is the primary task of Mongolia's foreign policy; so, 
we are glad to see that Mongolia has maintained friendly 
relations with these two great neighbors. 
  Orchirbat said President Jiang Zemin, in his letter to him, 
sets forth the principle for developing relations between China 
and Mongolia. He asked Premier Li Peng to convey his good 
wishes for President Jiang Zemin and hoped President Jiang will 
have an opportunity to visit Mongolia. 
  Li Peng said: The Chinese Goverment supports the Mongolian 
Government's foreign policy of safeguarding regional security 
and peace, and thanks the Mongolian Government for its support 
for China's independent foreign policy of peace. He stressed: 
China respects all countries' independence and their choice of 
political and economic systems. China hopes Mongolia will 
develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries, 
including Russia. We are willing to see that all countries get 
along friendly. Li Peng said he believed relations in the 
political, economic, and other fields between China and Mongolia 
will definitely further develop.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Western and Russian 
mediators have failed to narrow differences between Muslims and 
Bosnian Serbs on a cease-fire to revive peace talks. 
  A meeting between the newly formed "Contact Group" and 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb 
stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo on Friday [29 April] appeared 
to make little progress, reports reaching here said. 
  During the two-hour meeting, Serb leaders insisted on an 
overall permanent cease-fire in Bosnia, reports quoted the 
mediators as saying. 
  On Thursday, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic proposed a 
temporary truce of two to three months to allow time for a 
settlement of territorial disputes. 
  Bosnian Muslims fear that a permanent cease-fire would allow 
the serbs to hold on to captured land, stalling a final peace 
settlement. 
  The "Contact Group", consisting of representatives from 
Russia, the United States, the European Union (EU) and the 
United Nations, headed to Sarajevo for another meeting with 
Izetbegovic. 
  Before leaving Pale, Charles Redman, the U.S. representative 
of the group, stressed that differences between Serbs and 
Muslims over the length of a proposed cease-fire must be 
overcome before peace talks could resume. 
  Also on Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
reportedly proposed an interim one-year cease-fire to seek a 
final settlement in Bosnia. If a settlement is not then 
reached, a high-level conference can be convened for arbitration. 
  The mediation team, faced with the task of securing a 
cease-fire of at least three months and a division of Bosnia, is 
preparing a report for discussion at a ministerial meeting on 
Bosnia. 
  A member of the team was quoted by local media as saying 
that 
the difficulty will not be how much land the warring parties 
get, but rather which land. 
  After meeting with the "Contact Group", Izetbegovic raised 
new conditions for the resumption of peace talks, demanding that 
the world community formally recognize the territorial integrity 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He also asked that Serb forces "withdraw from the occupied 
Muslim and croat territories" as a precondition for new peace 
talks. 
  On Thursday, both Britain and the U.S. urged the three 
warring parties-- Serbs, Muslims and Croats--to come to the 
negotiating table and make "constructive efforts" in a new round 
of peace talks.

resolving the Bosnian crisis and sending humanitarian aid to the 
Moslems in Bosnia. 
  According to the communique, any territorial claim of the 
neighboring countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia was 
condemned and border disputes had to be settled without recourse 
to violence. 
  The communique said that the Serbs should immediately 
withdraw from areas occupied by force and to allow the return of 
all refugees dispersed in Croatia and other countries to their 
homes, as well as in other areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Talking to reporters before his departure, Valentic said 
that 
his government believed that there was a good chance that Serbs 
would also attack Macedonia, Kosovo and Sanjak in view of their 
aggressive policies. 
  He said that international organizations and UN Security 
Council should implement their resolutions issued concerning 
Bosnia and not to allow Serbs to continue their aggressions. 
  Iran's First Vice-President Hasan Habibi said that the three 
countries agreed on almost all issues concerning a trilateral 
cooperation among the three countries. 
  Habibi said that the negotiations resulted in setting up a 
joint commission between Iran, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
expand economic cooperation and to provide access to open seas 
for Bosnia through Croatia. 
  According to Iranian official news agency IRNA, three 
protocols were signed by Valentic and Iranian officials on 
transportation, cultural, social, commercial and technical 
cooperation.

  [Text] Damascus, April 30 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher arrived here from Israel this afternoon 
to mediate for the Middle East peace process. 
  He was met by Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' at 
Damascus International Airport. 
  Christopher came 4 hours later than what was scheduled and 
the American Embassy here did not explain the reason. 
  He is going to hold talks with Syrian President Hafiz 
al-Asad 
and hand him the Israeli peace plan on returning the Golan 
Heights to Syria. Israel seized the Golan in the 1967 Middle 
East war. 
  According to a statement issued Friday [29 April] by Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, the Israeli plan includes Israeli 
perspective on phased withdrawal from the plateau and 
normalization of relations between the two countries. 
  Christopher stated in Israel Friday that he is going to hold 
important talks here to revive the Syrian-Israeli talks. 
  He said that the aim the U.S. tries to reach is establishing 
a just and comprehensive peace in the region, something which 
necessitates enhancing the talks on the Syrian-Israeli track. 
  During his current Mideast tour, Christopher has already 
visited Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel.

  [Text] Huhhot, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
met with model workers from across the Inner Mongolia Autonomous

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Chao Yang (6392 3363): </F>
"Jiang Zemin Makes Inspection Tour of Shanghai at a Sensitive 
Moment and Stresses Stability"] 
  [Text] A reliable source has said that Jiang Zemin, CPC 
general secretary and state president, arrived in Shanghai on an 
inspection tour last Tuesday [26 April] and later paid a special 
visit to the Pudong new zone. A Shanghai official source 
believed that Jiang Zemin's return to Shanghai, where he had 
risen to power, has strong symbolic significance on the eve of 
the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident and the fourth 
anniversary of the launch of the Pudong full development project. 
  The source said that Jiang Zemin arrived in Shanghai on 26 
April (Tuesday) by special plane in the company of the CPC 
Central Committee General Office director Zeng Qinghong 
(formerly deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipality CPC 
Committee, and, as such, one of Jiang Zemin's henchmen). On the 
previous day (Monday) he received the visiting Canadian Governor 
Ramon John Hnatyshyn in Beijing, the last foreign guest that he 
was scheduled to entertain in April. On the afternoon of the 
same day -- when Jiang left Beijing -- the Central Military 
Commission called a forum to study the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, in which the officers in charge of the six 
major military regions were present. Jiang Zemin, as the 
chairman of the military commission, did not attend the forum, 
which was instead presided over by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of 
the military commission. 
  A Shanghai source revealed that Jiang Zemin stayed in Xijiao 
Guest House in Shanghai (the guesthouse where Deng Xiaoping used 
to stay when he came to Shanghai to pass the Chinese New Year). 
Most of the time he stayed in the guest house, except for the 
visit he paid the other day to the Pudong new zone. Over the 
past few days, he held meetings in the guest house with Shanghai 
leaders, including Wu Bangguo, a member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai 
Municipality CPC Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. It is 
said that they touched on such topics as the solution to 
problems that have arisen from the Pudong development project, 
the way to stabilize the commodity prices in the Shanghai 
market, and those issues facing state-owned large and medium 
enterprises in reform, for example, the shortage of funds, 
unemployment, and decrease in income. 
<H5>  Turmoil Is Intolerable, and Large Companies Are Being Asked </H5>
To Prop Up the Market 
  The source disclosed that Jiang Zemin had specifically 
stressed the issue of stability during this tour of Shanghai. 
As Shanghai is one of China's industrial hubs, the country's 
primary financial source, and a metropolis which is home to many 
state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin held that 
maintaining stability in Shanghai is a task "no less important 
than maintaining stability in Beijing." Because Shanghai 
managed to remain stable in 1989, the city played a crucial role 
in the rapid return to stability throughout the country at that 
time. The Shanghai authorities tacitly knew about this idea -- 
"stability overrides everything." So, back in March, after the 
people's congress session, they raised the amount of living 
expense allowance for retired workers. Recently the department 
concerned in Shanghai has been trying to convince major 
companies on the stock market to join forces in "propping up the 
market" and keep the Shanghai Stock Index above 600 points. The 
argument is that any turmoil which may burst out among stock 
investors is absolutely intolerable on the eve of the 
anniversary of the 4 June incident. In spite of this, the 
Shanghai stock market still failed to keep the index above the 
600 point level yesterday, when it dropped to 592. 
  The Shanghai informed source said that Shanghai is the place 
where Jiang Zemin rose to power. He was promoted to the central 
leadership to replace Zhao Ziyang as CPC general secretary in 
the middle of his term of office as secretary of the Shanghai 
municipality party committee. Next month will mark the fifth 
anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Beijing posting (he was summoned to 
Beijing on 16 May 1989). Now, at this sensitive moment -- the 
anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing ever nearer, 
China's economy is facing a lot of trouble, and political 
development is entering a post-Deng period -- Jiang Zemin's 
return to Shanghai could mean to support his henchmen and to 
consolidate his backyard, and this can be viewed as an event of 
strong symbolic significance. 
  It is said that, since both State Council Premier Li Peng 
and 
Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee in 
charge of party affairs, are now on missions abroad, all the 
major operations of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have been taken over by Zhu Rongji, acting premier and 
concurrently member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, 
and Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, while Jiang Zemin is away from Beijing. Two other 
senior members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, Qiao 
Shi, who also is the chairman of the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee, and Li Ruihuan, who is the chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National 
Committee, seldom attend to these matters. 
  Since Jiang Zemin is to receive Kenyan President Daniel T. 
Arap Moi, who will arrive in Beijing on 3 May (next Tuesday), he 
is expected to return to Beijing in the next few days.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 1 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 
China (CPC), called at the homes of a factory director, a 
textile weaver and a bridge builder here on the occasion of the 
International Labor Day today. 
  Accompanied by Wu Bangguo, secretary of the CPC Shanghai 
Municipal Committee, and Huang Ju, mayor of Shanghai, Jiang 
arrived at the home of Liu Tianfu, director of the Shanghai 
General Factory of Corduroy, at about 9:00 in the morning. He 
greeted Liu's family and praised Liu's spirit of fighting 
against difficulties to extricate his factory from the 
predicament of general debility. He said that he believes the 
factory will surely get better and better. 
  Liu was former director of the Shanghai No. 17 bleaching and 
dyeing mill, an advanced and profitable enterprise in Shanghai. 
But he voluntarily gave up the post to become director of the 
factory of corduroy, which had experienced general deficits. 
Although his monthly income has been greatly reduced, Liu has 
been mobilizing the workers and staff members of the factory of 
corduroy to turn the factory around. 
  Jiang and his contingent next arrived at the home of Du 
Yuying, a female weaver of the Shanghai Longtou Co. Ltd. 
(formerly the Shanghai No. L7 Textile Mill) who has developed an 
advanced method of looking after the looms and now studies the 
subject of management at the China textile university. Jiang 
encouraged Du to persist in studying and set an example for 
other workers. 
  Afterwards, Jiang called on Zhu Zhihao, chief commander of 
the construction of both the Nanpu and Yangpu bridges and one of 
the ten top model workers in Shanghai. The two bridges are 
among the biggest cable-stayed bridges in the world. Jiang 
asked about the design and construction of the bridges and 
encouraged Zhu and other bridge builders to catch up with world 
levels in construction of bridges. He also had pictures taken 
with the members of Zhu's three-generation family. 
  Hearing the news that General Secretary Jiang was calling at 
the workers' living quarters, many residents lined the road or 
stood on their balconies to applaud and extend regards to Jiang. 
Smiling, Jiang waved back to the crowds and said to them: 
"Happy festival."

  [Text] Chengdu, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Rural work must 
center around guaranteeing the supply of agricultural products 
and increasing farmers' income, a senior party official said 
recently in central China's Sichuan Province. 
  Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of 
the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks 
during his recent inspection of rural areas of Sichuan, a major 
agricultural province in China. 
  The countryside of China is undergoing a transformation from 
bare subsistence to a comparatively wealthy lifestyle, and from 
traditional to modern agriculture, according to Wen. 
  Two major strategic tasks lie before the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy, namely, the guaranteeing of a 
sufficient supply of agricultural products and the stable growth 
of farmers' income, Wen said. 
  He pointed out that to reach the two targets, rural reforms 
must be deepened to develop the rural economy in line with the 
overall planning and requirements of establishing a socialist 
market economic system. 
  Above all, the initiatives of farmers must be protected and 
mobilized and the status of agriculture as the foundation must 
be strengthened to guarantee its stable development, he noted. 
  Policies in favor of the development of major agricultural 
products, mainly reasonable price and purchasing policies, must 
be stipulated; high-efficiency and high-yield agriculture must 
be developed, relying on science and technology; and the 
government, collectives and individuals must all increase 
investment in agriculture to strengthen its comprehensive 
production capability, he said. 
  To increase farmers' income depends fundamentally on the 
overall development of the rural economy and the improvement of 
the rural economy's comprehensive efficiency, he pointed out. 
  He stressed that reforms must be deepened to realize the two 
major targets. The official also stressed the importance of 
market machanism in the distribution of resources agricultural 
production and the supply of agricultural products. 
  On the other hand, the government must enhance the macro 
control of agriculture, mainly through economic and legal 
methods, to support and protect agriculture, improve the 
stability and prosperity of the market and better protect the 
interests of farmers and consumers, he said. 
  While the summer harvest is in sight, the late-stage 
management of wheat must be strengthened and at the same time 
the preparatory plowing for late spring crops must be stepped 
up, Wen Jiabao pointed out. 
  Purchase funds for the harvest must be guaranteed to lay a 
solid foundation for a harvest for the whole year, he noted.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- To usher in 
International Labor Day that falls on 1 May, the Propaganda 
Department held a get-together meeting in Beijing today. About 
200 experts and scholars from social sciences, literature and 
art, as well as press and publication circles were invited to 
attend to strengthen contacts and enhance friendship in a happy 
atmosphere. 
  Zheng Bijian, executive deputy head of the Propaganda 
Department, spoke at the meeting. On behalf of Comrade Ding 
Guangen, he extended cordial holiday greetings to comrades in 
the social sciences, literature and art, and press and 
publication fields across the country. He also expressed his 
sincere thanks for their important contributions to and hard 
work in promoting socialist spiritual civilization and socialist 
modernization. Zheng Bijian said: It is very important to 
energetically strengthen the ties with social sciences, 
literature and art, and press and publication circles because we 
all shoulder a common historical responsibility, that is, to 
carry out the following four tasks forwarded by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin: "to arm the people with scientific theory, to guide the 
people with correct public opinion, to mold the people with 
noble spirit, and to encourage the people with fine works." We 
should stress the importance of spiritual civilization 
construction. In the light of the new historical stage our 
country has entered in our drive of reform, opening up, and 
socialist modernization and in consideration of the 
unprecedentedly severe competition of the overall national 
strength in the world including spiritual and cultural strength, 
such contacts, communication, and friendship become even more 
important. "The most important thing for cultivating friendship 
lies in understanding other's feeling." The Propaganda 
Department will try to "make friends with more people by winning 
their hearts." It will try its best to help them solve 
difficulties and problems existing in their work and daily life. 
  Liu Zhongde, deputy head of the Propaganda Department and 
minister of culture, also spoke at the meeting. He said: We 
are living a great historical period. Propaganda and cultural 
workers should perform their duties commensurate with the great 
epoch. We should spare no efforts to achieve this goal. 
  Zhai Taifeng, deputy head of the Propaganda Department, 
presided over the meeting during which representatives from 
social sciences, literature and art, and press and publication 
circles expressed their opinions. Also attending were 
responsible comrades from the Organization Department, the 
United Front Work Department, the Personnel Ministry, the 
People's Liberation Army General Political Department, and other 
units. During the get-together, literary and art workers as 
well as comrades of the organizations under the Propaganda 
Department jointly performed brilliant literary and art programs.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 1 May editorial: "The Working Class Are the </F>
Main Force for Reform, Development and Stability -- Celebrating 
1 May International Labor Day"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- In the days of spring 
full of vitality and in the struggle to seize the opportunity, 
deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain 
stability, the common festival of the laboring people of the 
whole world -- 1 May International Labor Day -- has come. We 
wish to extend our festival greetings to workers, peasants, 
intellectuals and all laboring people of various nationalities 
in the whole country! 
  This year will be a crucial year for accelerating the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure. We 
have to carry out the reform of the economic structure under the 
premise of maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development and also have to realize a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development under the situation of speeding up 
the reform of the economic structure. Therefore, we are 
required to do a lot of work and must correctly handle the 
relations between reform, development and stability, because 
those efforts are extremely important to having a good control 
of the overall situation and to doing a good job in this year's 
work. We must firmly rely on the working class and give full 
play to the role of the working class as the main force in 
deepening reform, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. 
  In order to give full play to the role of the working class 
as the main force in the course of reform, we must widely and 
penetratingly publicize the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, and encourage the broad masses of 
staff members and workers to understand, support, participate 
in, and promote reform. The working class was, is, and will be, 
the advanced productive force. The change of enterprises' 
operational mechanism and the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system are important links in the change of the 
economic structure. They are closely related to the personal 
interests of staff members and workers of enterprises, and they 
cannot achieve success without the understanding and support of 
the broad masses of staff members and workers. Reform will not 
change the staff members' and workers' position of being the 
masters of the country. Moreover, reform is to better whip up 
and develop the enthusiasm of staff members and workers, and to 
strengthen enterprises' vitality and vigor in the increasingly 
fierce competition of the market. In the course of carrying out 
reform by enterprises, we should actively explore new forms of 
democratic management and democratic supervision, protect the 
position of staff members and workers as the masters of the 
country, guarantee their power of using their due rights, and 
ensure that they will fulfill their own obligations. 
  To give full play to the role of the working class as the 
main force in the development, we must turn the enthusiasm, 
initiative, and creativity of the broad masses of staff members 
and workers into increasing production, practicing economy, 
raising quality, adding variety, increasing economic efficiency 
and carrying out technological innovation and also into running 
well enterprises and promoting the development of the productive 
force. Statistical data have shown that the work of staff 
members and workers of the whole country accounts for 
approximately 70 percent of the gross domestic product, or more 
than 90 percent of state revenues. Over the past decade and 
more, our country's economic power and combined national 
strength has increased significantly and we have made 
achievements which have attracted worldwide attention. The hard 
work of the working class is, in particular, inseparable to the 
consecutive high speed of economic growth in the past two years. 
In the future, the working class will also continuously make 
new contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation. 
  To bring into play the role of the working class as the 
main force in maintaining stability, we should thoroughly 
guarantee the working class' lawful rights and interests as 
stipulated in the constitution and other laws. China is a 
socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led 
by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and 
peasants; hence, the working class shoulders an important 
responsibility toward the country's long-term stability, order, 
and prosperity. Workers should pay attention to ideals, 
discipline, unity, and overall interests; should conscientiously 
subordinate individual to collective interests, local to 
national interests, and immediate to long-range interests; and 
should strive to maintain social stability and to safeguard the 
political situation characterized by stability and unity. 
  To carry out the great historic mission during the great 
social transformation, Chinese workers should step up the effort 
at study in order to comprehensively improve their quality. 
They should diligently study Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm their minds with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, enhance their awareness and steadfastness in 
implementing the party's basic line, and play an active role in 
building material and spiritual civilizations. They should 
study some rudimentary knowledge, basic theory, and legal 
knowledge on socialist market economy so that they can keep a 
clear head during the change of economic structure and be 
clearly aware of their position and role in reform. They should 
also study knowledge on management and operation, as well as 
science and technology, so that they can improve their skills in 
the socialist modernization drive. 
  To show concern for workers' livelihood and solve their 
practical problems is an important guarantee for bringing into 
better play the working class' role as the main force. Due to 
various reasons, some workers' living standards have improved 
slowly, and some have even encountered passing difficulties. 
Party committees, governments, and trade union organizations at 
all levels should, with a profound sense of responsibility, show 
concern for workers' livelihood and do everything possible to 
help them overcome difficulties. The fundamental way of solving 
problems lies in deepening reform and developing the economy. 
While solving problems, it is necessary to explain to workers 
why some problems are difficult to be solved immediately or 
completely. The party Central Committee has time and again 
instructed party organizations and leading cadres at all level 
to serve the people wholeheartedly, to forge close ties with the 
masses, and to show concern for their everyday life. Trade 
union organizations at all levels should listen attentively to 
the views of the masses, promptly and accurately reflect them to 
party and government departments, and try their utmost to help 
the masses. Recently the All-China Federation of Trade Unions 
launched a "show-compassion project" nationwide in a bid to 
mobilize various quarters of society to help solve problems for 
workers and enterprises plagued with difficulties. The project 
is essential and timely for enhancing the confidence and courage 
of enterprises and workers to tide over difficulties. Party 
committees and governments at all levels, as well as the whole 
society, should actively support this project to show the 
compassion of the party and the government for workers in 
distress. 
  Led by the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
as the nucleus, the large numbers of workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, and other working people throughout the country 
should unite more closely and work hard and adroitly with an 
indomitable spirit to create a bright future for our country and 
hundreds of millions of workers through reform and construction.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the "Opinion" page: "Labour Day"] </F>
  [Text] Tomorrow is Labour Day. 
  We want to extend holiday greetings to working people all 
over the world. 
  In China, workers are building a socialist market economy 
with Chinese characteristics. 
  And the growth of the national economy is the result of 
their 
hard work. Every step of the economic reforms has been boosted 
by their selfless support. 
  They have proved their worth as the leading class of the 
People's Republic and have earned the respect of the nation. 
  Although reform is now being targeted at central planning, 
the government continues to strive for workers' welfare. For 
instance, it is seeking effective ways of implementing the 
constitutional principle of "to each according to one's work." 
  The government is making great efforts to strike a balance 
between efficiency and fairness. 
  With the contract employment system, workers' rights and 
interests are safeguarded and their freedom in choosing jobs 
ensured. 
  While making a series of laws on labour safety and minimum 
pay, the government is constructing a uniform welfare umbrella 
for all workers regardless of the ownership of the enterprises 
which employ them. With rapid economic growth, the nation is 
also experiencing higher inflation and rising unemployment. 
  Current difficulties in the State-owned sector are affecting 
the living standards of the employees. 
  Infringements upon labour rights are on the rise in foreign- 
funded and private firms. And their labour safety standards are 
often found to be substandard. 
  As a result, trade union federations and relevant 
departments 
are raising their voice for speedy and substantial improvement 
on these issues. 
  While encouraging the private sector to create more jobs, 
the 
government is also helping to re-train surplus workers for 
reemployment. 
  The recent government decision to reduce State employees' 
working hours from 48 to 44 per week allowed working people to 
share the benefits of economic prosperity. 
  The authorities are also laying down labour rights in the 
new 
market economy. 
  The long-waited Labour Law will soon be adopted. And 
drafting laws on labour protection has been given priority. 
  With the deepening of reforms, Chinese workers will enjoy 
better protection and fuller rights.

  [Text] Beijing, May 1 (XINHUA) -- People in various parts 
of China celebrated the May 1st International Labor Day in 
different ways today. 
  In Shanghai, the largest industrial city of China, over 
5,000 
workers poured into the East Shanghai Workers' Cultural Palace 
to visit an exhibition of the heroic deeds of Bao Qifan, an 
inventor and one of the ten national model workers. Meanwhile, 
"Red-May" singing contests were held in over 30 workers' clubs. 
  Model workers became the stars at a rally of over 50,000 
people in Chongqing in southwest China's Sichuan Province to 
mark International Labor Day. With red flowers pinned to their 
chests, more than 560 model workers from various circles were 
praised and presented their skills at the rally. 
  Many workers in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei 
Province, stood fast at their posts, such as sites of highway 
construction, steel-making and airport construction. They made 
up their minds to make greater contributions as a celebration of 
their own festival on the day. 
  Leading officials of Liaoning Province and Shenyang city 
joined the local people in get-togethers in the four major parks 
in Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province. They saluted 
advanced workers at the provincial and city levels, who were 
also invited to attend the gatherings. 
  Wang Mingliang, director of the smeltery of the No. 3 Steel 
Plant of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, the largest special 
steel producing base of China, told XINHUA that a "Red-May" 
labor emulation drive was launched today to celebrate 
International Labor Day, and all the workers are enthusiastic 
about taking part in the drive.

<F P=106> [By Chou Jung (0719 2837): "Jiang Zemin Organizes Leading </F>
Body for Next Century; Top Leadership Fixes Orientation To 
Guarantee Stability"] 
  [Text] Jiang Zemin Stresses Need To Maintain 
Stability and Not To Lower Guard 
  At the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's 
Political Consustative Conference [CPPCC] sessions in Beijing, 
obvious hot topics were such questions as the readjustment and 
distribution of interests (including investment projects, 
development rates, preferential policies, and the ratio between 
profits and taxes), the anticorruption drive, the public order 
situation, and commodity prices. These are major questions 
which have a direct bearing on the success or failure of reform 
and on whether or not the overall situation is stable. CPC 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed that maintaining a stable 
situation across the country is a big question which is bound up 
with whether or not the party and the leadership survive and 
that we must not lower our guard in this regard. 
<H5>  Local Party and Government Officials Hold Radical Views </H5>
  One of the main characteristics of the above sessions was 
that CPPCC delegates, who had previously held radical views, 
mostly supported the CPC's reform proposals. Although they 
might not have agreed with the timing or the methods as to how 
the reform proposals are to be implemented, they could not put 
forward better counterproposals. This was not the case with NPC 
deputies from all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous 
regions, however. Local party and government officials, 
especially, held very radical views. 
  The CPC top leadership is worried that once the investment 
front becomes too long and development is too speedy, China may 
once again revert to price raises and inflation which will, in 
turn, introduce new instability factors into society. This was 
the real focus of concern for officials and the general public 
and is also crucial to the success or failure of this year's 
reform. The policy decisions were accepted by the overwhelming 
majority of NPC deputies and CPPCC delegates. In view of this, 
political reform will continue to be postponed, and 
maintaining a stable overall situation takes precedence, and has 
become a common consensus. 
  Judging from the current construction plan and the situation 
of reform and opening, the CPC is most concerned about 
guaranteeing the overall stability of agriculture, commodity 
prices, and society. 
<H5>  Planning To Form a Leading Group Straddling the Next Century </H5>
  As regular meetings of the NPC and CPPCC, the sessions, 
given 
no outstanding big issues, made comparatively few personnel 
changes. Two vice chairmen, Wan Guoquan and Zhu Guangya and a 
new secretary general Zhu Xun, were added at the CPPCC session. 
Wan is the leader of a democratic party, Zhu is an authority in 
science and technology circles, and Zhu Xun is the minister of 
geology and mineral resources. The personnel changes appear to 
give a clear picture of the pattern. On the other hand, the NPC 
Standing Committee elected two members, Zeng Xianzi and Nie Li, 
in a by-election and the CPPCC Standing Committee elected Zhang 
Yongzhen from Hong Kong in a by-election so that their 
compositions are more representative. These were all normal 
personnel arrangements. 
  The top CPC leadership attaches great importance to the 
stability of the leading groups of the party, the government, 
and the armed forces. At the last NPC session, Jiang Zemin 
stressed that the central leading groups are united and 
harmonious and so can cope with foreign interference and various 
kinds of tests at home. Judging from the trends and signs, 
after functioning and working for more than four years, the CPC 
leadership, with Jiang Zemin at the core, has already 
established a firm position in China. What they are now mainly 
planning is to supplement and form a group of young people to 
straddle the next century. 
  Many experts maintain that the 9 percent economic growth and 
the 10 percent price increases in Li Peng's Government Work 
Report are comparatively appropriate indexes of development and 
stability. Economist Liu Guoguang said: For three consecutive 
years, China has grown at a rate of 10 percent or more and this 
is unprecedented in the world. We should not only see whether 
or not China can endure it this year but also consider the 
economic efficiency next year and the year after next. 
This year's macroregulation and control should control 
economic growth slightly so that what should be controlled is 
controlled and what should have controls relaxed has them 
relaxed appropriately. 
  Not long ago, Deng Xiaoping said: "China is already a 
political power. It will also become an economic power in the 
future." The CPC expects to maintain healthy and sustained 
growth rates through a careful and mature layout of economic 
reform and construction, to succeed in building new market 
economic mechanisms and join the ranks of world economic powers. 
<H5>  It Is Vital To Guarantee the Stability of Agriculture </H5>
  Without grain, there is no stability. This is a saying by 
CPC elders, and above all Deng Xiaoping, who have always used it 
to remind the leading group. 
  Since the series of reform plans were introduced earlier 
in the year, all localities have vied with each other to 
initiate development projects which "require less input, yield 
greater economic results, and promise quick returns." This, 
coupled with the continually increasing cost of agriculture, 
results in farmland being laid waste. The continuously mounting 
pressure of "migrant workers" coming into the cities has led, in 
some places, to the panic purchase of grain, edible oils, and 
foodstuffs and also to prices being driven up. This has highly 
alarmed the top CPC leadership. No sooner had the NPC 
session finished than the CPC called the Central Work Conference 
on Agriculture. There, Jiang Zemin stressed the need to 
consolidate the fundamental role of agriculture and guarantee 
the steady development of agriculture and the entire rural 
economy. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji's Worries </H5>
  In order to support agricultural production, the State 
Council initiated reform of the grain purchase and marketing 
system, whereby the purchasing and sales prices of grain and 
edible oils were increased and all provinces, municipalities, 
and autonomous regions canceled city and town supply rations and 
opened up the grain and edible oils markets. Zhu Rongji said: 
Here there is a rational factor, that is, grain prices must be 
increased because they are so low that peasants do not find it 
pays to grow grain crops. However, he also admitted that it is 
both pleasing and worrying to increase grain prices. What is 
pleasing is that peasants will have their incomes increased and 
what is worrying is that the grain prices in some places are 
driven up artificially so that there is the worry that the price 
increases do not really go into the hands of the peasants but to 
the intermediary links or to those who change hands. Zhu Rongji 
said: It is necessary to continue to stick to the orientation 
of reform and continue to proceed with the reform of the 
purchasing and marketing systems. There is no turning back and 
we are unable to turn back. He maintained that it is necessary 
to resolve the current problems. He also said that the rise in 
grain prices will push up other prices and will lead to panic 
among the residents which will, in turn, affect the process of 
reform and therefore must be seriously dealt with. The reform 
aim is to promote a steady growth in grain production, promote a 
brisk and stable market, and protect the interests of peasants. 
If the existing salient problems are not properly resolved, it 
will be difficult to achieve the goal of grain reform. For this 
reason, it is necessary to strengthen macroregulation and 
control, establish a grain storage system and a risk fund, and 
stick to the protective- price purchasing system. 
<H5>  CPC Plans for Future Agricultural Development </H5>
  It is learned that the main goals set by the CPC for 
agricultural development in the 1990's are: To develop the 
rural economy in a comprehensive way, stabilize the output 
increases of major farm products, and meet the needs of 
achieving comparatively comfortable living standards for the 
people throughout the country and of the national economy in 
terms of quantity, variety, and quality. 
  For this reason, China will continue to stabilize contract 
responsibility systems, chiefly the contract responsibility 
system on a household basis with renumeration linked to output; 
perfect the system of unified management combined with 
independent management; vigorously develop the collectivized 
agricultural services; and gradually enhance the collective 
economic strength. It will continuously consolidate the 
agricultural foundation, increase agricultural inputs, improve 
basic agricultural facilities, and ensure that agriculture is 
further upgraded to meet the needs of the development of the 
national economy. It will deepen rural reform and strengthen 
the development of such basic facilities as the rural markets, 
communications, transportation, storage, information, and 
consultancy services as well as the development of various 
socialized service systems. It will strengthen the promotion of 
agricultural scientific research and technology; continue to 
arrange for comprehensive agricultural development and 
utilization of standby resources; optimize the rural industrial 
and economic structures; vigorously develop 
foreign-exchange-earning agriculture; integrate crop growing, 
livestock breeding, and processing and combine trade, industry, 
and agriculture; develop new industries and new fields of 
employment in rural areas; and enhance comprehensive productive 
capability. It will encourage peasants to increase incomes and 
achieve a comparatively comfortable life. 
<H5>  The Success or Failure of Reforms in China Today Depends on </H5>
Commodity Prices 
  Commodity prices are a very sensitive nerve in the market 
and 
society. In the first two months of this year, commodity price 
indexes across the country had a startling rise of almost 20 
percent. Both Li Peng and Zhu Rongji criticized raising 
the prices of such foodstuffs as milk before the opening of the 
Beijing Municipal People's Congress session. Zhu Rongji 
said: Many large and medium cities around the world grant some 
public subsidies in order to stabilize social life. We must 
never pass the burden on to the public or concentrate their 
money on expanding the infrastructural scale. Guangdong's 
economy has been developing speedily in recent years but its 
farmland has been seriously laid waste. Some cadres claim they 
have money to buy grain even if it is much more expensive, so 
they raise grain prices and engage in panic purchases 
everywhere, affecting the normal market economy. Zhu 
Rongji criticized Guangdong for shirking its responsibilities to 
others now that it has so big a population and so much good 
farmland. He stressed that stabilizing commodity prices is 
vital to the success or failure of reforms. 
  Zhu Rongji Criticizes Guangdong [as published] 
  In view of this, the State Council published a special 
document appealing for measures to limit commodity prices and an 
inspection team, headed by State Planning Commission Minister 
Chen Jinhua and two vice ministers, visited various localities 
around the country to inquire into the question of commodity 
prices. In response to the repeated appeals from various 
localities to quicken development, during the NPC session, the 
top CPC leadership gave explanations to various deputations and 
repeatedly stressed that they had to be realistic, acting in 
keeping with their capabilities, and that they should curb the 
trend of being enthusiastic about initiating new projects 
without considering their conditions. For this reason, they 
have to strengthen and improve macroregulation and control and 
prevent the recurrence of inflation. Key CPC figures stressed 
that macroregulation and control should control economic growth 
slightly in light of the actual situation so that what should be 
controlled is controlled and what should have its controls 
relaxed have them relaxed appropriately. 
  This is a crucial year for reform say the CPC authorities. 
China not only needs to establish market economic mechanisms 
but also needs to link the home market with the international 
market gradually and strive to rejoin GATT as soon as possible. 
Therefore, all reforms, such as the reform of finance, tariffs, 
banking, foreign trade, commodity prices, investment, tax 
revenue, business administration, and the enterprise systems 
embody these two objectives. 
<H5>  Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin Guard Against U.S. Strategy of </H5>
"Westernization and Division" 
  At the NPC session in March, most of the NPC deputies and 
CPPCC delegates from all provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions supported the various reform proposals. On 
his visit to Beijing, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
did not get what he had anticipated. Deng Xiaoping and Jiang 
Zemin will not give way in guarding against the U.S. strategy of 
"Westernization and division." On the question of restoring 
China's GATT membership, U.S. representative Dorros Dewerszhin 
[duo luo xi de wo er si jin 1122 5700 6007 1795 3087 1422 2448 
6855] declined to give China a definite date when it can rejoin 
GATT although representatives of Japan, the European Union, 
Canada, Uruguay, and the Scandinavian countries all hoped that 
China, the most populated country in the world, be allowed to 
rejoin GATT. At the session, Gu Yongjiang, Chinese 
representative and vice minister at the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] deeply regretted that 
the question of rejoining GATT remained unresolved, despite 
talks for the past seven years. On 18 April, MOFTEC Minister Wu 
Yi headed a large delegation for a new round of relevant talks 
in the United States. It is now impossible to predict what the 
future results will be but, recently, Clinton and some U.S. 
Congressmen and prominent political figures have repeatedly 
given speeches stressing the need to focus on long-term 
U.S.-Chinese relations. Many people favor separating human 
rights, economic relations, and most-favored-nation status. Out 
of consideration for Sino-U.S. bilateral interests and 
development, most observers are still optimistic about the 
prospect of the development of relations between China and the 
United States, the two big powers. 
  However, it is very difficult to judge whether or not it is 
good for China to rejoin GATT. Mainland China's reform is at a 
stage where key problems are being tackled and many economic 
relations have yet to be straightened out. Many experts 
conclude the fact that if China hastily rejoins GATT this will 
have serious consequences and will obviously increase by more 
than one-third the losses in its state-owned enterprises. They 
hold that the influx of large quantities of foreign products and 
their impact will even lead to the bankruptcy of a considerable 
number of enterprises, to an increase in the number unemployed, 
and to a considerable increase in the instability factors in 
society. Therefore, they argue that it is much more conducive 
for China to rejoin GATT at a later date. Other experts maintain 
that China's rejoining GATT presents a great opportunity to 
change itself into a market economy and that the advantages 
outweigh the disadvantages. One thing we can be certain of is 
that the prospect of rejoining GATT, as the CPC announced 
earlier, has not been decided to date. 
<H5>  Protracted War Against Corruption </H5>
  The problem of power corruption is worrying the key CPC 
figures. Jiang Zemin criticized it saying: Corruption has 
developed to the point whereby people will not do anything 
unless they are given money or presents. Some county-level 
cities cannot even pay wages to their staff and teachers while 
their party and government departments have money to purchase 
deluxe sedans. We must not underestimate the seriousness and 
harm of the problem and must adopt resolute measures to resolve 
it. We must handle corruption cases strictly in accordance with 
the law, thoroughly investigate violations of discipline and 
law, dismiss those who should be dismissed, sentence those who 
should be sentenced, and sternly punish those who should be 
sternly punished. Those who seriously interfere with or 
obstruct the investigation of cases should be resolutely 
punished. In this year's anticorruption work, we should 
concentrate our energies on investigating and dealing with big 
and serious cases; resolutely emphasize the investigation of 
lawbreaking cases by party and government leading organs, 
leading cadres, and judicial departments, administrative and 
law-enforcement departments, economic administration 
departments, and their work personnel; make it a point to 
investigate and deal with the bribery and corruption cases 
featuring leading cadres and the malpractices of judicial and 
administrative personnel, such as practicing favoritism, 
perverting justice for bribes, harboring lawbreakers, as well as 
crimes crimes committed by legal persons. 
  Obstacles to the Anti-Corruption Drive 
  Since the CPC put forward the five rules regarding how 
cadres 
should keep their hands clean and exercise self-discipline, 
cadres at all levels have launched self-investigations and have 
obtained some practical results. However, the top CPC 
leadership maintains that the anticorruption work is not 
proceeding in a balanced way and that many problems exist in it. 
In the self-investigations, some cadres have dealt with 
insignificant and overt matters rather than big and covert ones. 
They have not even talked about the obvious problems before 
them or dealt with the many problems already discovered. 
Influenced by the "idea that corruption is inevitable," some 
leading cadres argue that "economic development should take the 
lead and adherence to the four cardinal principles should give 
way" because it will "be smooth sailing to do only one type of 
work and attach importance to it" and it will be "difficult at 
both ends to do two types of work and attach simultaneous 
importance to them." Moreover, they argue that one "is liable to 
make an error if one braves it out" and that one "should be 
allowed to pay tuition fees [jiao xue fei 0074 1331 6316]." The 
cadres in some localities and departments fear they will 
register a loss if they do too much anticorruption work while 
others are worried that continuing the anticorruption work will 
affect reform and opening up and economic development. Being 
unclear themselves, some officials fear they will get into 
trouble if they continue the work. It has become very popular 
that they do not report corruption, do not handle corruption 
cases, or do not strictly enforce the law. It still prevails 
that their words speak louder than the law and their power 
outweighs the law. 
<H5>  Resist the "Tendency To Beg For Leniency" and Break the </H5>
"Network of Connections" and "Protective Layer" 
  The top CPC leadership maintains that, as the economy is 
growing and reform is deepening, some new circumstances and 
contradictions will appear in the readjustment of interests of 
all parties and in the change of concepts. People will take 
advantage of the loopholes afforded by the unsound legal system 
and supervisory mechanisms and continue with their corrupt 
practices, seeking private gain by violating the law and 
discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to continue with the 
anticorruption work in a thorough, protracted, and more 
effective way and to concentrate energies on the investigation 
and handling of big and serious cases. It is necessary to 
resist the "tendency to beg for leniency" and break the "network 
of connections" and the "protective layer," and further 
consolidate the coordination of the discipline inspection 
supervisory organs and the supervisory organs for judicial, 
personnel, administrative, and law-enforcement organs, enhancing 
their overall capability in dealing with corruption cases. 
  In order to match the need of thoroughly pursuing reform 
this 
year, it is necessary to promptly remove those corrupt elements 
who symbolize state power and who are in the legal machinery. 
Only by doing this can political power and social stability be 
consolidated. The top CPC leadership emphasizes that this year's 
anticorruption work will begin with three areas: First,

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The first vocational 
school for criminals in China opened last week in Fuzhou, 
capital of southeast China's Fujian Province. 
  Zhonghua (China) Vocational School of Fujian, which covers 
an 
area of 33 ha [hectares] in Minhou County, in Fuzhou Proper, was 
jointly sponsored by the Provincial Reform-Through-Labor Bureau 
and the Zhonghua Vocational Education Society of Fujian. 
  The school is aimed at reducing the rate of criminal 
recurrence through helping offenders who will soon be released 
to grasp an occupational skill so that they can stand on their 
own when they return to society. 
  At present, the school teaches five vocations, including 
repair and maintenance of motorcycles and of household 
electrical appliances, cookery, cake-making and decoration. 
  For the first term it has enrolled more than 300 criminals 
in 
the province who have remaining sentences of less than half a 
year, have good performance records and are willing to go to 
school. 
  Three to four terms are scheduled for this year, each 
lasting 
for three to five months. About 1,000 will undergo training. 
  The curriculum will be renewed and expanded in line with 
economic development, according to school officials.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China's 
trans-provincial population movement over the recent few years 
has helped reduce population growth instead of adding to the 
population pressure, according to a recent survey published here 
today. 
  Based on the fourth national population census and the 
random 
survey of areas with the largest number of migrants, the survey 
is conducted by the family planning department of Guangdong 
Province. 
  The survey concludes that the general birth rate of the 
flowing population is 34.5 per thousand lower than the 
non-floating population and the peak child-bearing age is 28, 
two years later than the non-floating population. 
  China's population began to flow into cities and developed 
coastal areas in the early 1980s when China started its rural 
reform. 
  Government sources said that up to 110 million farmers have 
left their land for industry and services in cities and some 20 
million people have been in trans-provincial movement. 
Guangdong Province has the largest number of migrants. It was 
estimated that there are more than 10 million migrants, mostly 
women, accounting for one sixth of the total permanent residents 
in the province. 
  Jiang Xiaodong, an official from Guangdong Provincial Family 
Planning Commission, said, generally speaking, the population 
movement is favorable for pushing the family planning policy. 
  He said that by moving into cities, the rural people have to 
spend most of their time improving their living standards and 
skills in order to struggle to survive keen competition and this 
compels them to delay their marriage and control birth. 
  By moving into cities, he said, rural residents have to 
accept the new ideas and new habits of living, thus making it 
favorable for them to break away from the traditional ideas 
about marriage and birth.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Mao Lei (3029 4320): "China </F>
Maintains Good Order in Labor-Reform Centers, Improves Quality 
of Reeducation Through Labor"] 
  [Text] During a recent interview, Justice Ministry 
Spokesman Jia Jingping told this reporter that good order had 
been kept in reform-through-labor and reeducation-through-labor 
centers in China, with the escape rate of prisoners and 
detainees undergoing re-education through labor remaining at the 
lowest level. 
  Justice Ministry statistics show that last year 1,244,000 
prisoners were kept in prisons or reform-through-labor camps in 
the country. In the same year, 247,000 prisoners had their 
sentences reduced, 33,000 prisoners were released on parole, and 
34,000 were released on bail for medical treatment, all because 
they had shown repentance or had done deeds of merit during 
their terms of imprisonment. A total of 301,000 prisoners were 
released on the completion of their terms of imprisonment last 
year. 
  Jia Jingping said: Reform-through-labor organs throughout 
the country have always adhered to the principle of integration 
of penalty and reform, with reform as the primary goal, and they 
have further strengthened surveillance, management, and reform 
of prisoners; tried hard to improve the quality of their work to 
reform prisoners; helped prisoners make a fresh start; and thus 
made contributions to preserving social stability. 
  He revealed that last year was yet another to witness 
stability in prisons and reform-through-labor camps across the 
country, with the case occurrence rate lowered to the lowest 
level since 1984. The prisoner escape rate is 1.4 per thousand, 
still at a relatively low level, compared with past records. 
  Asked about conditions in re-education-through-labor 
centers, 
Jia Jingping said re-education-through-labor organizations in 
the country have further stepped up their efforts to educate and 
help personnel undergoing the re-education-through-labor 
process. Stability has been retained in 
re-education-through-labor camps, with the escape rate remaining 
at the lowest level, as compared with past records. 
  By the end of 1993, detainees kept in 
re-education-through-labor camps across the country totaled 
153,000, an increase of 16.1 percent over 1992. These detainees 
included 3,800 women detained for prostitution, accounting for 
47.5 percent of the females detained in 
reeducation-through-labor camps. A total of 11,800 people were 
detained for drug addiction, making up 7.7 percent of all the 
detainees. In the same year, a total of 75,900 were released 
from re-education-through-labor camps following the completion 
of their terms of detention, while 55,800 detainees had their 
re-education-through-labor periods shortened because of good 
behavior in camps.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China is making 
efforts to reform the enrollment of colleges and universities 
and employment methods of college graduates, according to the 
State Education Commission. 
  The reform, now on a trial basis, is aimed at changing the 
traditional obligation of the state to pay fees for university 
students and assign them to jobs when they graduate. 
  According to the new methods, colleges and universities will 
work out rational fee collection methods under which new 
students will have to pay a certain amount of fees calculated 
according to varying costs for different majors and relative 
family income. 
  On the other hand, such higher learning institutions will 
offer scholarships and student loans to encourage industrious 
study habits and preparation to compete on the labor market. 
  The institutions in turn will announce enrollment plans in 
advance, with reference to different majors in different 
provinces and regions, and make clear their fee standards in 
order for students to choose appropriate college locales and 
majors. 
  In this way, a college or university only has to set a 
unified standard for enrolling students to form a fair 
competition mechanism for all. 
  Traditionally, in addition to enrolling students who do not 
have to pay fees under the state's overall plan, universities 
have been allowed to admit students with sub-par entrance exam 
marks as long as they pay their own expenses. 
  The state will set up specific scholarships to meet demands 
in majors relating to key state construction projects, national 
defense, cultural and educational undertakings, basic sciences 
and eventual assignment to work in remote places. 
  Industrial enterprises and social institutions will also be 
allowed to establish scholarships. Students can apply for such 
specific scholarships but will have to be employed according to 
corresponding contracts signed beforehand. 
  In time, all students who do not apply for scholarships will 
have to rely on their own effort to find jobs when they graduate. 
  This year, 37 Chinese colleges and universities will begin 
to 
carry out such reforms.

<F P=106> [By He Jun: "Freshmen To Pay Tuition in 37 Top </F>
Universities"] 
  [Text] Freshmen students attending China's top 37 colleges 
and universities will have to pay their own tuition beginning 
this fall, the State Education Commission announced yesterday. 
  And when they graduate, they will have to find their own 
jobs 
as part of this year's reform of the higher education system. 
  Students attending these 37 institutes will be asked to pay 
annual tuition of 1,000 to 1,500 yuan ($115 to $175), according 
to State Education Commission (SEC) officials. 
  The new tuition policy is designed to eventually replace the 
current so-called "dual track system" for college enrollments 
and job assignments. 
  The policy is meant to maintain higher education standards. 
uphold the policy of equal educational opportunities for all 
students and encourage collegians to study harder, according to 
Zhang Tianbao, SEC Vice-Minister. 
  The Chinese Government previously paid for everything but 
food and clothing for college students. 
  Then, in the mid-1980s, institutions began enrolling 
enterprise funded and self-funded students. 
  These students, who pay their own way, have been warmly 
welcomed by colleges. Schools see them as a source of revenue. 
  Self-funded students have increased substantially over the 
past few years and now account for 40 to 50 percent of some 
academies' enrollments. 
  But the rise in self-funded students has come at a cost, 
according to Zhang. 
  These undergraduates have actually lessened the quality of 
student bodies, he charged, especially at schools accepting 
pupils who scored low on the national college entrance exam in 
exchange for higher tuition fees. 
  The practice has also kept some needy students with higher 
scores from going to better schools, he added. 
  The new policy sets one cut-off score for each school and 
establishes a tuition standard for all new students Zhang said. 
  Students at other colleges will abide by the old policies, 
he 
added. 
  The universities and colleges piloting the new policy are 
mostly directly guided by SEC. They include Qinghua, Beijing 
and Nankai universities. 
  While emphasizing that higher education is non-compulsory 
education, Zhang said tuition standards must be set according to 
the exact costs for each student as well as the resources of 
students' families and local economic conditions. 
  Since some schools used to charge 2,000 to 4,000 yuan ($230 
to $460) annual tuition from enterprise- and self-funded 
students, the incomes of some colleges will likely decrease with 
the advent of the new policy Zhang said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhang Xia: "Self-Study Provides New </F>
Skills at a Lower Price"] 
  [Text] Studying at home is all the rage these days. 
  For those who fail the entrance examinations for higher 
education, teaching oneself has become the thing to do. And it 
has become a popular and effective way to learn new skills, said 
a Chinese educator at a recent international seminar in Jinan, 
Shandong Province. 
  Hu Jiajun, director of the Self-taught Examination Office of 
Shandong, said the home-study method has helped many Chinese 
work their way up the career ladder. 
  Those interested sign up at provincial bureaux, which offer 
courses and textbooks on a wide range of subjects. 
  Students can choose a specific subject, study on their own 
and take a final exam at an approved university. Course credits 
are given and college-equivalent diplomas are awarded to those 
who pass enough classes. 
  In the past decade, the country's rapid development has 
increased the need for a highly educated work force . 
  But the number of graduates coming out of the country's 
universities is too small to meet this demand. 
  So high school students who do not qualify for college and 
middle-aged workers are finding other ways to obtain an 
education. 
  The generation that grew up during the "cultural revolution" 
(1966-76) was deprived of higher education in their youth and 
are especially eager to study. 
  To meet this demand, various forms of adult education have 
started in the past 15 years. 
<H5>  Night Classes </H5>
  Most popular are night classes at universities, self-study 
and correspondence schools. 
  Some classes are geared towards illiterate adults, other 
towards providing employees with professional training. 
  Self-study was initiated in 1981 as an experiment in 
Beijing, 
Tianjin Shanghai and Liaoning Province. Three years later it 
spread across the nation. 
  This is by far the cheapest way to get schooling -- and 
therefore suitable to China, which is suffering from a shortage 
of education funds. Students pay only for their textbooks, 
registration and test fees. 
  According to United Nations statistics, China's education 
fund accounted for only 1.8 percent of world spending on 
schooling -- appealingly little considering it shoulders nearly 
a quarter of the world's population. 
  Efforts need to be made to improve education. And self-study 
is a quick way to provide schooling when funds are scarce, said 
Hu. 
  For example, the State spends 7,500 yuan ($860) to put a 
student through a technical school. To get the same level 
diploma through self-study costs only half as much. 
  Moreover, those who go through self-study can continue 
working at their jobs while schooling. 
  Self-study graduates can enjoy equal treatment as their 
college counterparts. 
  And self-study is more open and flexible. 
  Unlike night universities and correspondence courses, people 
do not have to pass tests to enroll. And there is no age limit. 
  But Hu said self-study must be regulated and courses should 
be set by experts after careful research. 
  Provincial self-taught examination offices must report to 
the 
State Education Commission (SEC) the courses and majors they 
offer as well as the university that supervises examinations. 
Offices can enroll students only after SEC approval. 
  Self-study is based on a credit system. Normally it takes 
two to three years to receive a diploma, but students who earn 
enough credits may graduate early. Students also have the 
option of taking as long as they need to complete the course. 
  By the end of 1993, 222 self-study majors were offered 
nationwide. More than 1 million students have graduated and 
received diplomas, helping to ease the country's shortage of 
professional personnel, Hu said. 
  This year 5 million people are enrolled in self-study. 
  And to ensure quality, Hu said certified educators are sent 
to supervise exams. Students found cheating are severely 
punished. 
  Reports show that most graduates of self-study schooling 
have 
a good command of basic knowledge and have good problem-solving 
skills. Because of this, self-study has a good reputation, he 
said. 
<H5>  Advisors </H5>
  The employees at two law firms in Yantai, Shandong Province, 
for example, received their legal training through self-study. 
They act as legal advisors for more than 50 enterprises and 
institutions in the city. 
  And with their excellent counsel, they have helped 
enterprises save 38 million yuan ($4.4 million). 
  But the self-study system is not perfect, Hu said, adding 
that the programme should cater to economic development needs. 
  Majors used to be limited to law, insurance, accounting and 
literature. In the future, engineering might be offered if 
teaching institutions allow students to use their equipment, Hu 
said. 
  Other fields may be opened to self-study in the future as 
well. 
  Self-taught examination offices could also help evaluate 
students and the quality of teaching at primary and high schools. 
  Doing so would save the State money and manpower, Hu said. 
  The seminar, co-hosted by Shandong Teachers' University and 
University of Nottingham, drew 80 educators from six countries.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in south 
China's Guangdong Province have forever changed the image of the 
lonely tiller of the soil and become owners of farms and 
breeding factories, thanks to the strong backing of local social 
service systems in rural areas. 
  Although he raises more than 2,000 pigs every year, Zeng 
Jinqi, a bright young farmer in Shunde City, has eliminated the 
worries of seeking marketing channels and buying forage and 
vaccines. 
  Whenever he needs a particular service, a phone call to the 
local social service network will soon bring about satisfactory 
assistance. 
  Multi-level and comprehensive social service systems have 
come into being in recent years along with the rapid burgeoning 
of modernized agriculture in this comparatively prosperous 
region of China. 
  Services provided include supply of funds, seeds, and forage 
to farmers, purchase of agricultural products from farmers, 
technological consultation and assistance in taking out various 
kinds of insurance. 
  Among the 15,100 social service institutes dotted throughout 
the towns and villages in Guangdong, a kind of "hospital for 
crops" has received the most praise from local farmers. 
  Numbering more than 630, the hospitals for crops have 
effectively solved technological problems peasants face in 
farming, guided them to grow crops benefiting from more 
scientific know-how and combined technological consultation with 
prompt supply of high-quality seeds and fertilizers. 
  The fruitful work of local social service systems has 
greatly 
increased the economic benefits of agriculture, and local 
farmers' interest in agricultural activities has been redoubled 
accordingly.

  [Text] Washington, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice 
Minister of Finance Jin Renqing 26 April said in Washington: 
The solution to the population problem of developing countries 
must depend on the incessant efforts of governments and people 
of developing countries themselves, but strengthening 
international cooperation is also an important part in solving 
the problem. 
  Jin Renqing made the above remarks when he attended the 1994 
spring meeting of the World Bank Development Committee. He 
hoped that the developed countries would proceed from the view 
of helping the joint development of all mankind and adopt some 
effective measures to solve the world population problem, such 
as providing money and technical assistance to and improving the 
outside environment for developing countries. He also hoped 
that international organizations, including the World Bank, 
would adopt more positive policies on the population issue. 
  Jin Renqing said: There is a close relationship between 
population and development. To the many developing countries, 
rapid population growth will certainly limit their economic 
development, obstruct their efforts to raise people's standard 
of living, and put heavy pressure on their natural resources and 
ecological environment. The cheering thing is that more and 
more countries and people have realized this and are making 
positive efforts in this respect. 
  Touching on the issue of international trade, Jin Renqing 
pointed out: The implementation of GATT's Uruguay Round 
agreement still needs to be solved. He hoped that all concerned 
parties, especially the developed countries, would keep their 
promises and make due contributions to promoting the developing 
countries' economic development as well as promoting 
international trade and world economy. 
  Jin Renqing emphatically pointed out that the international 
community should closely watch the continuous fall of prices of 
primary products, which account for the major part of the 
developing countries' income. This situation will not only 
cause the unreasonable shift of the deserved income of poor 
countries to rich ones but also will adversely affect some 
developing countries' efforts to adjust their economic 
development policies.

<F P=106> [By Patricia Lee] </F>
  [Text] The inflation problem in China is now under the 
central government's control, according to an official from the 
Bank Of China in Hong Kong. The Bank of China's Hong Kong Macao 
Office assistant officer, Zheng Polin, said the government's 
attempts to curb the overheating economy had gradually been 
effective. The over-supply of currency was under control and 
the amount of bank deposits had gradually risen in the wake of 
the economic reforms adopted during the second half of 1993. 
  Mr Zheng said yesterday that the series of reforms in China 
also enhanced the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and 
provided ample opportunities for the territory's economic 
development. The banking sector in Hong Kong had been further 
developed with the opening by 13 local banks of 60 branches or 
offices in China since 1985, he said. In turn, the China-based 
commercial banks had established offices in the territory. 
  Both the financial and securities markets in Hong Kong would 
grow bigger, because they could act as centres for the large 
amount of fund raising required for the restructuring of China 
state-owned enterprises and many construction projects. Mr 
Zheng stressed that Shanghai could not usurp Hong Kong's 
position as the prime financial centre, in view of the time 
needed to develop it and the different characteristics of both 
cities. Neither did Singapore have the ability to surpass Hong 
Kong as, in comparison to Hong Kong, it was geographically far 
from China. 
  China Merchants vice-general manager Lin Jiang said high 
inflation would cause pressure on the stability of the yuan 
exchange rate. The exchange rate was being stabilised after the 
currency's unification, which also implied that the timing and 
other mechanisms for the reforms were correct. He expected that 
the exchange rate of the yuan would be maintained in the near 
future as the policies of the Peoples' Bank of China would be 
effective in relieving the pressure on the demand for foreign 
currency in China. However, the stability of the yuan in the 
medium to long-term depended on fundamental economic factors 
such as inflation and interest rates. 
  Mr Lin said it was unlikely that the business market for 
foreign banks would open within the next year or two because 
state banks were not competitive enough in terms of operations, 
management and staff skills. The government would tend to 
protect the state banks until they were mature enough to compete 
on an equal basis, he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- In an interview with 
this reporter today, State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen 
said that the momentum of continuous commodity price increases 
was effectively restrained and that the prices of consumer 
goods, capital goods, and services in the nation's urban and 
rural areas declined noticeably in March. 
  Ye Zhen said: According to statistics, compared with 
February, when commodity prices rose dramatically, consumer 
prices in the nation's urban and rural areas declined by 1.5 and 
0.1 percentage points, respectively; the prices of services 
declined by 0.3 percentage points, and the prices of capital 
goods declined by 5.1 percentage point in March, thus 
demonstrating that the momentum of commodity price increases has 
been alleviated. The preliminary results achieved in 
controlling commodity prices can be attributed primarily to the 
greater efforts exerted by the central government and local 
governments at all levels. As a result of the actions taken by 
local governments at various levels as well as the efforts made 
by the State Council in intensifying the control over 
investments in fixed assets as well as consumption needs, in 
promoting agricultural production, specially the "food basket" 
project; in supervising the prices of people's living 
necessities and services, and in conducting nationwide price 
inspection, preliminary results in controlling price increases 
were achieved within a short time. 
  In analyzing the causes of the sharp commodity price 
increases early this year, Ye Zhen said that they were primarily 
caused by irrational phenomena -- such as the mentality of 
jumping on the bandwagon as well as unscrupulousness in raising 
prices -- following the introduction of the new tax system. 
Market prices rose quite rapidly especially after price 
controls for most commodities were removed and before mechanisms 
for effective macroeconomic regulation and control were 
established or improved. This phenomenon to which the masses 
responded strongly was particularly noticeable in the prices of 
basic necessities, such as food, clothing, services, and other 
items closely related to people's daily life. 
  Although macroeconomic regulation and control over commodity 
prices have produced results, Ye Zhen stressed: Compared to the 
same period in 1992, the nation's retail prices during the first 
quarter still increased 20.1 percent. The extent of this 
increase is still way above the target set by the state. All 
quarters must therefore continue to exercise strict control over 
commodity prices and should not lower their guard in the least.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- China is poised to adopt 
five measures this year to alleviate the burden on enterprises 
in a bid to create the conditions for state-owned enterprises to 
be involved in fair market competition. The measures are listed 
as follows. 
  First, the taxation rate will be unified in order to 
reinforce the ability to service debts and allow state-owned 
enterprises to obtain capital. Starting January 1, 1994, 
revenue tax on enterprises making use of domestic capital was 
set at 33 percent while the budgetary regulated tax imposed on 
state-owned medium- and large-sized enterprises as well as the 
energy and transport fund together with the budgetary regulated 
fund levied on state-owned enterprises have been cancelled. 
According to industrial policy, state-owned solely-funded 
enterprises which needed strong support could retain their 
after-tax profits. Cost accounting for enterprises is 
standardized and interest resulting from loans is included into 
the cost. Enterprises could make use of the above- mentioned 
practices to strengthen their servicing ability. 
  Second, the debt burden shouldered by state-owned 
enterprises 
should be settled reasonably. Enterprises locked in 
difficulties in repaying loans for fixed-assets investment are 
allowed to defer the debt repayment after examination and 
approval by the creditor bank. Enterprises long suffering from 
bad debts are allowed to have part of their funds reserved for 
bad debts to be settled by a creditor bank. 
  Third, non-production-oriented business will gradually be 
separated from enterprises. Schools which have long been run by 
enterprises for the children of workers and service business for 
workers have to be separated from the enterprises as much as 
possible. Those schools and service businesses can instead be 
supported by the government or by private groups. 
  Fourth, redundancy of workers seen in some old enterprises 
has to be solved. Workers made redundant can be settled in 
tertiary industry and in economic entities newly created for 
service. Policy has to be formulated to encourage some workers 
to turn to township enterprises, three type foreign-funded 
enterprises and privately-owned enterprises while at the same 
time workers are allowed to seek jobs for themselves. 
  Fifth, enterprises which have long run in the red are 
subject 
to bankruptcy, merger, reorganization or transformed into joint 
ventures as a radical solution to the burden on enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- The real estate market 
has to be standardized this year, according to the Minister of 
Construction Mr. Hou Jie. Work has to be done in several 
sectors to achieve this end. 
  -- The primary market where the transfer of land is possible 
has to be put under proper administration. The amount of land 
supply, location and purpose have to strictly observe the 
planning. The purpose and nature concerning the use of land 
have to be clearly defined. The practice of administrative 
allocation of land has to be reduced to the minimum while the 
transfer of land with payment has to be employed. 
  -- The transfer and management of land has to be 
strengthened. Before enforcement of the "Real estate law" the 
ministry will make known as soon as possible regulations on land 
transfer, sales of commodity housing and the transacting of real 
estate. They cover rules and procedures for real estate trading 
as well as punishment for violation of the regulations. 
  -- The taxation system for real estate has to be improved 
with the interests of and rights enjoyed by the parties 
concerned taken into consideration. 
  -- The market function has to be strengthened and 
intermediary service has to be exploited to cover information, 
consultation, assessment and the role of agent. Professional 
workers in these sectors have to be trained. Requirements will 
have to be set for entry into this profession. The state will 
soon promulgate regulations on the evaluation and registration 
of real estate. 
  -- A price system for real estate has to be set up and 
principles for prices for commodity housing, welfare housing and 
standard housing have to be confirmed. Land price and 
corresponding taxation policy have also to be formulated. 
  -- Administration of foreign investment in real estate has 
to 
be strengthened. Foreign capital is allowed to be involved in 
general residential housing, a great potential market featuring 
a relatively short period for the input of investment. 
International practice has to be employed in the administration 
of foreign investment in real estate. 
  -- The government must not apply excessive intervention in 
the real estate sector. Land prices have been decided not by 
the market but by the government in the past and the blind 
establishment of development zones is attributed to such 
practice. Administrative functions and standardization by the 
government has to be properly handled. 
  -- The "Real estate law" has to be made public and brought 
into force as soon as possible. Loss of control of real estate 
last year was mainly due to the weak legal system. The law 
drafted by the ministry has been submitted to the State Council 
for appraisal and approval and it is expected that the law will 
come into force shortly.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "$4.8b State Treasury Bonds Sold"] </F>
  [Text] More than 41.6 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) of this 
year's State treasury bonds were sold across China by Wednesday 
[27 April], a leading State Council official said yesterday. 
  The figure accounted for 47 percent of the sales target of 
87 
billion yuan ($10 billion) set for the year. The bonds went on 
sale this month. 
  Nevertheless, State Council Secretary General Luo Gan urged 
financial officials to push the sales drive harder to meet this 
year's target well ahead of schedule. 
  Luo Gan, who is also a State Councillor, stated in a 
tele-conference that fulfilling this year's target is of vital 
importance to the country's economic development. 
  "The issuing plan of treasury bonds must be completed on 
schedule in order to maintain the sustained, rapid and sound 
growth of the national economy," Luo said. 
  It is also important for maintaining political stability and 
promoting social progress, the conferees were told. 
  Each province and city must appoint a high-level official to 
guide the bond issues. 
  Luo urged different local governmental departments to 
continue promoting bond sales and local banks to help bond 
buyers. 
  Luo's comments were echoed by Vice-Finance Minister Xiang 
Huaicheng and Vice-President of People's Bank of China Dai 
Xianglong. 
  Chinese people have shown great interest in buying bonds 
because of their high interest rates.

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Labour Disputes Increase 50 Percent"] </F>
  [Text] Labour disputes have sharply risen in the past few 
years, flooding arbitration committees nationwide with more than 
12,000 cases in 1993 alone. 
  Last year, arbitration committees accepted and heard 12,358 
labour disputes, up 51.6 percent from 1992, according to a 
Labour Ministry and State Statistics Bureau report released this 
week. 
  More than 92 percent of the cases were settled by the end of 
the year. 
  About 2,800 arbitration committees have been set up at 
various levels since 1986, the ministry said. 
  Meanwhile, half of the provinces, municipalities and 
autonomous regions in the country have established labour 
supervisory institutions. 
  The labour unrest is the result of poor management in the 
enterprises, especially overseas-funded and private firms, 
imperfect laws and lack of labour markets, the ministry said. 
  Another reason for the increase in disputes is labour 
controversy has finally come out in the open. 
  Disputes in non-government firms rose more sharply than 
State- owned ones. 
  In the past years, Guangdong Province has handled 7.892 
labour disputes among which 1,421 happened at non-State 
companies. 
  The employers often hired workers without signing a contract 
so they could be fired at will. 
  Some managers defaulted or embezzled workers' wages and even 
subjected the workers to indignities. 
  China Business Times reported that about 300 workers at a 
company in Huizhou, Guangdong, held a two-day strike because 
their Hong Kong boss had fallen far behind in payments. 
  Before the Spring Festival in early February, the company 
paid each worker 100 yuan ($11.5) because it was afraid they 
would not return. 
  However, the workers didn't get January and February wages 
on 
March 15. 
  The city's labour supervisory department recently imposed a 
fine on the boss and instructed the company to pay the two 
months' wages immediately. 
  Strikes have also happened in the foreign-funded enterprises 
in other cities. 
  But some labour disputes were initiated when workers broke 
their contracts, the report said. 
  To protect legal rights of both the enterprises and' the 
workers, the ministry is making efforts to research the 
arbitration system and set up a nationwide network.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "State Is To Consolidate Carmaking </F>
Industry"] 
  [Text] China expects to consolidate its more than 120 
automotive plants into three or four giants that would enable 
the car industry to make 5 million vehicles annually. 
  The giants, each to annually make at least 1 million 
low-priced quality cars with clean-burning engines, are to be 
competitive internationally. 
  In an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY, a senior official from 
the Ministry of Machinery Industry elaborated on the industry's 
long- range programme. 
  This goal of consolidation is the core of the new policies 
that are to govern the country's auto industry for the next 
seven years, the official said. The policies are to be 
announced before long. 
  By the year 2000, six to seven conglomerates are expected to 
be formed from the 13 existing auto groups. Each is expected to 
make 300,000 sedans a year. 
  In the early decades of the next century, the conglomerates 
are to be further reshuffled into three or four larger ones. 
  The official, who declined to be identified, said that the 
reorganization will take place in competitive conditions under a 
market economy, but that macroeconomic planning by the central 
government will be beefed up to ensure the industry develops in 
the direction set by the new policies. 
  The industry, expected to grow into an economic pillar, will 
not repeat development formulas used in some Western nations 
where auto giants achieved dominance after nearly 100 years of 
intense competition among hundreds of carmakers. 
  He said the 13 existing auto groups, whose size makes them 
ripe for further development, will be supported by the central 
government. 
  He cited eight major carmakers in particular: the 
Changchun-based First Automotive Works; the Shiyan-based 
Dongfeng Group; the Nanjing Automotive Industry Corp; the China 
National Heavy-duty Truck Corp; and manufacturers in Beijing, 
Tianjin, Shanghai and Shenyang. 
  The auto groups will be granted preference in financing, 
taxation and the issuing of securities. 
  For the next two or three years, no new assembly projects 
will be allowed, but the official did not rule out the 
possibility that foreign investment in assembling cars will be 
permitted in later years. 
  "We advocate different policies in different phases," he 
said. 
  Moderate protection of the domestic market from assaults by 
floods of Western imports is necessary. Periods of protection 
by way of tariffs, import quotas and licenses and other means 
will be different for different vehicles, he said. 
  The protection of the market for trucks needs to span three 
to five years but for sedans, 10 years, he said. 
  Such protection, which is used by nearly every nation, is 
needed by China's fledgling auto industry, especially sedan 
manufacturers, who turned out 240,000 cars last year. However, 
he said the protection will be weakened gradually as the 
industry grows stronger. 
  "So large a market as China's will be vulnerable to free 
imports of cars," he said. 
  The government will pay great attention to improving vehicle 
safety, reducing auto pollution and raising fuel efficiency, the 
official said. 
  However, he said the country will probably lag behind 
Western 
nations, where extremely stiff standards are to take effect 
around 1996. 
  To reduce vehicle emissions and develop fuel-saving engines, 
China will beef up investment and draw up new laws and 
regulations. 
  China has participated in international activities related 
to 
vehicle emissions and fuel consumption and expects co-operation 
with foreigners will continue. 
  It expects to become integrated into the global auto market 
with a relatively independent, competitive industry in the early 
decades of the next century, the official said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Li Wen: "Trade Fair Closes With 12 </F>
Percent Surge in Exports"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou -- The 75th Chinese Commodities Trade 
Fair came to a record close on Saturday as total export 
contracts topped last autumn's exhibition by $1 billion, a 12 
percent jump. 
  Spokesman Zhao Hua said trading was brisk during the 15-day 
event. 
  "Daily trade volume topped $800 million during the peak 
days," he said. 
  Hong Kong and Macao remained the fair's top partners, 
signing 
one-third of the contracts. The European Union, the United 
States and Southeast Asia followed with 16.8, 9.9 and 7.9 
percent of the respective trade share. 
  Vice-Premier Li Lanqing, in his fair tour on Friday, urged 
trade companies to invigorate China's drive for exports, 
according to a Xinhua report. He was accompanied by Foreign 
Trade Minister Wu Yi and Zhu Senlin, governor of Guangdong 
Province. 
  In his speech to provincial trade officials, Li said 
competition is a main reason for the fair's record transactions. 
  He affirmed competitive bidding for export quotas is an 
effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between 
Chinese export companies. He said such a practice should be 
applied to more than the present 13 commodities. 
  Li fully agrees with the plan to display similar commodities 
at one place. 
  At the fair, contracted exports to the Middle East, 
Southeast 
Asia and Latin America all increased, Zhao said. 
  Seventeen Chinese trade delegations each signed contracts 
valued at more than $200 million. 
  "The increase in trade deals at the fair is attributable to 
the recovering world economy and China's new financial and 
foreign trade reforms implemented this year," Zhao said. 
  Meanwhile, he stressed that bogus goods were not tolerated 
at 
the fair, as 20 companies were punished for using fake trade 
marks on their products. 
  Organizers publicized those companies' names, confiscated 
their fake trade marks and drove some of them out of the fair. 
  "Further investigation and punishment is pending and 
organizers are discussing whether or not to allow them to attend 
the coming fair," said Zhao. 
  The infringed trade marks were found in 20 firms, including 
Shenzhen Kaichen, Guangxi Machinery Import and Export, Xingjiang 
Zhongxin, Shenzhen Foreign Trade Group and Changfa Company, 
China Aerospace Technological Import and Export Fujian Branch, 
Anhui Chemical Products Import and Export, Shantou International 
Trading Overseas and trade companies from Shanxi, Hubei and 
Hunan provinces. 
  Vice-Premier Li urged local trade officials to take 
advantage 
of new trade policies, like the single exchange rate, to boost 
their exports. 
  Li admitted the policies need improvement but urged trade 
authorities to take any necessary steps to prevent future 
problems from arising. 
  Li said foreign importers may unreasonably depress the 
prices 
of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters may also 
unreasonably raise their prices, resulting in soaring prices for 
foreign currencies. 
  Establishing a modern enterprise system and multinational 
operations should be the direction for remolding foreign trade 
enterprises, he added. 
  The semi-annual, trade event was expected to help fulfill 
this year's planned export target of $100 billion. 
  Zhao said new mechanical and electrical products were in 
high 
demand. More than 60 per cent of the goods displayed by the 
Guangzhou trade delegation were new. 
  The quota bidding system for 13 domestic products has helped 
stabilize or raise export prices, he explained. The price of 
garlic rose 20 per cent from last year. 
  More than 50,000 foreign businessmen visited the fair, 4,000 
more than last fall. 
  The number of Southeast Asian guests increased. And the more 
than 4,000 American visitors matched the Taiwanese total. 
  Japan's sluggish economy lead to fewer Japanese visitors 
fair 
organizers said.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According 
to a "spring forecast" by economic experts at the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistical Bureau on 
China's economic development trend in 1994, this year, China's 
commodity retail sales price index will increase by 13.2 percent 
and the citizens' cost of living index will rise by 14.5 
percent, the rate of increase being similar to or a little 
higher than last year. The price index of investment goods [tou 
zi pin 2121 6327 0756] will rise by approximately 15 percent, 
lower than last year. 
  This "spring forecast" points out that China's commodity 
price level has kept rising since the fourth quarter of 1992. 
The situation is even more serious in 1994. In the first 
quarter of this year, the country's retail sales price index 
rose by 21 percent over the same period of last year. Now, the 
central authorities have taken various measures to control these 
excessive price increases. In March, price increases began to 
slow down. 
  The "spring forecast" indicates that if excessive price 
increases are not stopped quickly, this will endanger reform, 
affect development, and also cause instability in society; 
therefore commodity prices should not be treated lightly. 
  Since the introduction of reform and opening up in 1979, 
until 1993, China's average annual economic growth rate was 9.3 
percent, and the average annual rate of price increases was 6.4 
percent. This situation was comparatively ideal, the "spring 
forecast" adds. But inflation and economic growth reached a 
critical level in 1993, and the inflation rate has tended to 
exceed the economic growth rate in 1994. Therefore, the first 
task in macrocontrol and regulation is to maintain a rational 
balance between economic growth and inflation and to strive to 
bring about healthy development during which the national 
economy will grow fast and inflation will be controlled at a low 
level.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- To relax the strained 
telecommunications situation and make it easier for people to 
get information, China is quickening steps in constructing a 
34,000-km first-class optical cable telecommunications network 
connecting all of the country's provincial capitals. 
  China has set an ambitious target for telecommunications 
construction in its eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), that is, 
building 22 national-level trunk lines of optical cable within 
five years, to connect all the provincial capitals. 
  Assessed from present achievements, China is moving smoothly 
towards this goal. 
  So far 11 of the 22 optical cables have been opened, of 
which 
eight cables were opened in 1993. This year the construction or 
remolding of 15 optical cables is being successfully carried out. 
  Experts said that, compared with traditional 
telecommunications means such as electrical conduits and 
microwave relays, optical fibers made from quartz glass have far 
more advantages. For example, a pair of optical cables with the 
thickness of a hair can provide thousands of digital telephone 
lines simultaneously. 
  China began to study optical fibers and related equipment in 
the early 1970s. In the 1980s China built the first two optical 
cables, the Wuhan-Nanjing and Lanzhou-Xining lines. 
  China's construction of optical cable has witnessed 
surprising development since 1990. In the past few years China 
opened the trunk lines of Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Fuzhou, 
Fuzhou-Guangzhou, Beijing-Jinan-Nanjing, 
Beijing-Wuhan-Guangzhou, Guangzhou-Haikou, Guangzhou-Nanjing, 
Zhengzhou-Xian, Xian-Chengdu and Chengdu-Kunming, and the 
submarine optical cable connecting China and Japan was also 
opened last year. 
  Presently China is intensifying the construction of a number 
of optical cables including the first-class trunk lines of 
Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin, Nanjing-Kunming, Xuzhou-Zhengzhou and 
Xian-Lanzhou. 
  To ensure successful construction of telecommunications 
projects, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has 
decided to put 53.6 billion yuan into fixed assets this year, 
compared with a 40 billion yuan investment last year. 
  China's optical cable construction speed is said to be the 
fastest in the world--most of the cables have been finished in 
about one year from laying the cable to installing equipment. 
  The 2,800-km optical cable along the south China coast runs 
through five provinces and cities and was constructed and opened 
in only one year. 
  Another example is the 4,700-km Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin 
optical cable, whose construction was started last October. To 
date, the laying of cable has basically been finished. The 
total construction term for this line is predicted to be only 
eight months. 
  Construction of optical cable has greatly promoted the 
development of China's posts and telecommunications. Statistics 
show that in 1993 alone long-distance automatic exchanges 
increased by 548,000 lines, bringing the total capacity to 1.06 
million lines, while newly-increased long-distance 
telecommunications lines reached 200,000, bringing the total 
capacity to 420,000 lines.

  [Text] Huhhot, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Construction of the 
Inner Mongolian chemical fertilizer plant, a major national 
project for the Eighth State Five-Year Plan (1991-95), has been 
proceeding smoothly. 
  So far, construction of the living quarters, auxiliary 
public 
facilities and production workshops has been completed. In 
addition, the main production installations, including the urea 
grain formation tower and the high-pressure boiler, are under 
construction. 
  The construction of the plant began on December 20, 1991, 
and 
is expected to be completed at the end of 1995. With the total 
investment reaching 2.4 billion yuan (277 million U.S. dollars), 
the plant is designed to produce annually 300,000 tons of 
synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea. The plant is 
expected to start trial production in 1996.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wu: "Service Trades Are Opening Up"] </F>
  [Text] China is opening up some service sectors that were 
off- limits to foreign and domestic investors and is simplifying 
its procedures for approving new businesses. 
  The State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce said 
that it 
would give a "green light" for foreign investors to join in the 
development of China's service industry. 
  "Foreign investors will be allowed to start handling 
previously restricted businesses such as real estate 
development, large-sized retail centres, transport and 
communications, finance and tourism," said an official with the 
administration. 
  The government's procedures for approving foreign-invested 
firms in these businesses will also be simplified this year, he 
added. 
  The administration will give its approval if cash-sufficient 
financial companies want to set up non-financial firms or invest 
in other businesses. 
  Existing service businesses and trust and investment firms, 
which have raised more than 100 million yuan ($11.5 million) in 
capital, will be encouraged to expand into other commercial 
fields. With the administration's approval, these firms can 
establish subsidiaries in engineering, construction and real 
estate. 
  Since the country vows to fortify its service industry, the 
administration officials said, foreign and domestic suppliers of 
materials and marketing firms are now allowed to engage in more 
businesses. 
  They can be involved in wholesale and retail business and 
act 
as commercial agents in buying and selling goods for others, 
according to administration officials. 
  The administration will also lend support to technicians and 
scientists who have quit their jobs and want to set up firms of 
their own. 
  It will streamline its procedures for granting these 
technicians and scientists permission to start consulting and 
service businesses related to information technology. 
  The government, meanwhile, will extend similar treatment to 
encourage officials in its own administrative organs to enter 
business. These staff officials were essential under the 
previous organization, but with the government streamlining its 
structure the need for them is diminished. 
  So now they can apply to run businesses on their own. But 
they must first resign from their government departments before 
jumping into the "sea of commerce." 
  The State Administration for Industry and Commerce is also 
backing change in the countryside. With its blessing, the 
government's agricultural service centres are now free to 
explore lucrative businesses on their own. 
  With the administration's approval rural technique 
popularization centres and household livestock veterinary 
stations can transform themselves into profit-seeking companies 
with farm and sideline processing factories and information 
consulting and service businesses. 
  According to the State Statistics Bureau, the government's 
firm support has helped channel more foreign-invested companies 
and individual firms into Chinese industries. 
  The bureau's figures show that China approved 100,000 
foreign- funded projects last year, representing foreign direct 
investment in excess of $33 billion. 
  By the end of last year, the country had nearly 17.7 million 
individual business households, up 16.2 percent from a year 
earlier. It also had 238,000 privately owned firms, up 70.4 per 
cent.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- Facing the 
situation in which the audio and video publications market is in 
disorder and illegal copying and pirating continues despite 
repeated bannings, the more than 60 members of the China Audio 
and Video Publications Exchange Association, who produce audio 
and video publications, recently joined forces in drawing up the 
"Convention on Protecting the Copyright of Audio and Video 
Publications" to protect audio and video publications producers' 
legitimate rights and interests and to crack down on the very 
rampant illegal copying and pirating of audio and video 
publications. 
  The "Convention" stipulates: All convention signatories 
pledge to exemplarily comply with all relevant state regulations 
on protecting copyrights and will boycott all activities that 
infringe on the rights and interests of audio and video 
publications producers. All signatories are naturally agents 
for protecting copyrights and give full authorization to other 
signatories in investigating pirating, illegally copying, 
counterfeiting identification marks, selling counterfeit 
publications, and other activities infringing on signatories' 
rights that take place in their locale. The convention is the 
first of its kind of China's audio and video publications 
industry. [passage omitted] 
  It has been learned that the China Audio and Video 
Publications Exchange Association is China's first mass 
organization dealing with the audio and video business. The 
organization primarily devotes its efforts to protecting 
copyrights of audio and video publications and to conducting 
exchanges between the audio and video industry and the film and 
television industry, as well as exchanges with units outside the 
country, to bring about common improvements, to improve the 
quality of China's audio and video publications, and to purify 
the country's audio and video publications market.

<F P=106> [Report by Ma Zhiping: "Office Set To Ensure Just Deals"] </F>
  [Text] A special department has been established by the 
government to thwart the emergence of unfair competition on the 
domestic market and prevent unauthorized monopoly of trade. 
  The new office -- the Department of Fair Trading under the 
State Administration for Industry and Commerce -- is responsible 
for ensuring fair competition and banning illegal monopolies in 
the business sector, according to sources with the state 
administration. 
  The department is also responsible for drafting rules 
concerning fair trade and dealing with unethical trade cases. 
  Other obligations of the new State organ include 
investigating and dealing with cases of illegal speculation, 
protecting consumers rights and handling serious 
consumer-related cases. 
  It will also oversee the implementation of business 
contracts, while helping guide the resolution of economic 
disputes in China's arbitration courts. 
  To eliminate unfair trading practices and illegal 
monopolies, 
China last year instituted a law governing unfair competition. 
Another law to protect intellectual property rights has been 
passed. 
  The government is further considering the introduction of a 
new law banning illegal trade monopolies. It would supplement 
the law governing unfair competition in a bid to ensure fair 
trade, administration officials said. 
  The new law is expected to ban regional restrictive business 
practices and unfair restraint of trade by public utilities, 
such as cooking gas and electrical supply companies. 
  Unfair trade practices such as illegal lotteries to promote 
sales and kickbacks in awarding business contracts are still 
common in China. Cases that have been discovered have been 
dealt with by the law, according to local reports. 
  A Hainan Province company was recently fined 10,000 yuan 
($1,150) for setting a top prize of 30,000 yuan ($3,448) in a 
promotion activity. The prize was much higher than the law's 
ceiling of 5,000 yuan ($575) for such awards.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Purchase and sales in 
the materials distribution and supply system suffered a sharp 
setback in the first quarter this year with huge losses of over 
RMB [Renminbi] 1 billion, the Vice Minister of Internal Trade 
Mr. Ma Yimin disclosed at a meeting attended by managers of 
electro- mechanical companies across the country. Information 
released by the Ministry indicated that the purchase value was 
put at RMB 68.62 billion while the sales value registered RMB 
80.1 billion during the first quarter of this year. There were 
9,000 enterprises under the system suffering a loss, making up 
52 percent of the total. The sales of major kinds of materials 
showed a comprehensive drop with cotton down by 51 percent, 
steel material by 41 percent, aluminium- steel by 60 percent and 
cars by 33 percent. 
  The loss, according to Mr. Ma, was mainly attributed to 
investment in key construction items not in place while some 
production enterprises suffered from a shortage of circulation 
capital which in turn caused a slump in market demand. Second, 
enterprises were not familiar with the new taxation system and 
negative impacts were caused. Third, an increase in interest 
represented a drop of profits. Fourth, measures adopted were 
not so effective because of insufficient understanding of the 
macro- economic situation. The vice minister asked personnel 
within the system for great efforts to reverse the loss.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- According to a 
statistical bulletin on urban construction in 1993 by the 
Ministry of Construction, by the end of last year, China had 570 
cities, 53 more than in the previous year, the total urban 
population reached 338.726 million, 165.595 million of them were 
non-agricultural residents, the total area of cities was put at 
1.027812 million square kilometres and the urban area 16,472.9 
square kilometres and the population density per square 
kilometre was 329 people. 
  The report also shows that the urban residential conditions 
further improved with the total floor area of newly constructed 
buildings last year reaching 281.59 million square metres, 29.1 
percent up over the year before, 16.562 million square metres of 
which was residential blocks, 28.3 percent up, making a grand 
total area of such housing in the urban area by the end of last 
year 1.2966 billion square metres. The urban residents were 
173.44 million by the end of last year and their per capita 
living space was 7.5 square metres, more than 10 percent up. 
  With the speeding up of commodity residential housing, last 
year saw active trading in housing property with the total area 
under transaction being put at 32.92 million square metres and 
the trading value RMB [Renminbi] 36.4 billion, respective 
increases of 51.5 percent and 96.6 percent over the year before. 
The total housing area under lease was 1.11449 billion square 
metres and the income earned from rents was RMB 2.8 billion, 
1.46 times and 15.7 percent up respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- China's 605 
million-strong workers produced 3,138 billion yuan in gross 
national product and 511.48 billion yuan worth of financial 
revenue last year, according to the state statistics bureau. 
  Chinese workers in 1993 consisted of 150.4 million factory 
workers, 11.16 million self-employed businessmen and workers in 
private-run enterprises and 444.34 million rural laborers. 
  Falling under various occupational categories, 347.92 
million 
Chinese workers worked in primary industries, 135.5 million in 
secondary industries, and 122.48 million in tertiary industries. 
  Rural laborers produced 456.4 billion kg of grain and 17.61 
million tons of edible oil. Those who worked in township 
enterprises yielded a total of 2,902.2 billion yuan in output 
value. 
  In addition, laborers in heavy industry, agriculture and 
other industries produced an import and export volume of more 
than 190 billion U.S. dollars last year. 
  In the first quarter of this year, Chinese workers produced 
more than 2.3 billion kwh of electricity, 2.75 million tons of 
raw coal, 43 million meters of cloth, 42,000 color television 
sets, nearly 30,000 washing machines and 52,000 cameras, all on 
average per day.

<F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The caller is fed up. She has been working seven 
days a week at a Beijing printing plant for several weeks. Her 
boss won't give her a day off. She's exhausted, but doesn't 
complain for fear of being fired. A worker at a foreign-funded 
factory in the northeastern port city of Dalian has a different 
problem: He wants to know how to stage a strike to demand a 
wage rise so his pay package keeps up with sky-rocketing 
inflation. Another young caller is so depressed with his 
"meaningless" job that he wants to commit suicide. 
  Such are the problems that workers across China pour out on 
perhaps the most sensitive of Beijing's help lines, the worker 
hotline. Operating five nights a week since March 1, the 
hotline is run by 22 young scholars in a spartan office at the 
Chinese Workers' Movement Institute. The Labourers' Emotional 
Consulting Hotline is hardly a solution to the difficulties 
workers face in the wrenching transformation from a Marxist to 
market economy, but it gives them an outlet to voice concerns 
and get some advice. 
  "The system for Chinese workers is changing now," said Deng 
Weiyun, 31, a university lecturer and hotline chairman. "In the 
past the problems weren't so serious, and the traditional way of 
dealing with them was to go to the leader. Once you had a job, 
you rarely lost it. Now... all at once, for no reason, a worker 
may be out of a job. So we hope to give them some help to get 
accustomed to the changes." 
  The hotline has had more than 200 calls since it opened, 
more 
than 80 percent of them from people at state-run enterprises. 
That percentage is not surprising, given that nearly half of 
the state enterprises are operating in the red and that they 
face the prospect of cost-cutting and streamlining reforms which 
would inevitably hurt some workers. 
  Callers complain their wages are too low, their jobs are 
boring, or they are unemployed. Others worry about the 
financial health of their enterprise, and are distraught because 
they feel their jobs offer no future. 
  The advice they get does not challenge any of the precepts 
of 
the Government. Staff might suggest the caller approach his or 
her labour union, seek the help of a worker arbitration 
committee, find a new job, learn a new skill. Sometimes they 
suggest how to find a new job. Such advice may seem obvious, 
but not necessarily in China, where workers have been accustomed 
to the cradle-to-grave employment system. 
  But the hotline would never encourage strike action, or 
anything else which might rankle the authorities. Mr Deng said 
his staff encouraged workers to act within the laws of the state.

<F P=106> [By William D. Grossman, director of the Hong Kong Office of </F>
Quantum Financial Services, Inc.: "Futures Industry Needs Self- 
Regulation"] 
  [Text] During the past two years, the futures industry in 
China has grown faster than even the most ardent optimists could 
have anticipated. Exchanges have sprung up in major commercial 
centres, and brokerage firms, trading on both domestic and 
international markets, have multiplied. 
  Along with this progress, however, has come concern. Most 
notably, business has expanded far more quickly than regulation, 
leaving a gap that has attracted the unwary and the unscrupulous. 
  In response, the central government is adopting 
comprehensive 
regulations governing the futures industry. 
  This is perhaps the right time to set up a futures industry 
self- regulatory organization to enhance its enforcement 
capabilities. 
  The situation in China's futures industry is similar to that 
of the U.S. in the 1970's. At that time, this sector of the 
U.S. economy was loosely regulated by the Commodity Exchange 
Authority (CEA), an office within the Department of Agriculture. 
The CEA concentrated on domestic agricultural futures, while 
products such as coffee, sugar and metals were unregulated. 
  In addition, there was no formal, well-enforced registration 
process for persons handling customers' funds and orders. This 
provided a breeding ground for sharp operators who took 
advantage of unsuspecting customers. Not surprisingly, scandals 
began to emerge. 
  As a result, the U.S. Congress passed amendments to the 
Commodity Exchanges Act in 1974, which, among other things, 
created the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
  The CFTC was set up as an independent federal regulatory 
agency. It was given responsibility for registering industry 
professionals; approving rules, regulations, and new contracts 
of futures exchanges; establishing minimum financial standards 
and adopting trading standards for futures brokers; and creating 
a dispute procedure. Equally important, the CFTC was assigned 
the responsibility of enforcing the rules it adopted. 
  Initially, the CFTC had only 200 employees. Today it has 
about 700. But with such a small staff and limited resources, 
it was apparent that enforcement of the strict new provisions of 
the Commodity Exchange Act would be difficult. 
  So the CFTC adopted regulations requiring each exchange to 
set up its own rules, subject to CFTC approval, and to enforce 
these rules on all the exchange's members. 
  The CFTC had two reasons for requiring the exchanges to 
conduct self-regulation. First, it wanted to economize on its 
own resources which are funded by tax-payers' money. Second, by 
delegating auditing and enforcement responsibilities to the 
exchanges, the CFTC intended to take advantage of the fact that 
the exchanges would be in the best position to monitor the daily 
activities of their members and obtain relevant market 
information. 
  Exchange self-regulation was successful in promoting fair 
markets and building confidence on the part of both domestic and 
international customers. 
  However, there was a problem, not every futures broker was a 
member of a futures exchange. And because of the CFTC's limited 
resources, these brokers were able to avoid strict government 
scrutiny of their activities. 
  In response, the CFTC-approved National Futures Association 
was set up on October 1, 1982, to audit and monitor non-exchange 
members. 
  The industry endorsed the concept of self-regulation for 
three reasons. 
  First, it could promote high standards of professional 
conduct and financial responsibility. 
  Second, the industry believed that a private sector self- 
regulatory organization could operate with a high degree of 
efficiency and expertise. 
  Third, it was anticipated that a private sector 
self-regulatory organization could operate more economically 
than the CFTC. In this regard, the NFA's funding, which comes 
from customer transaction fees of $0.20 per round turn for each 
futures contract and $0.12 per side for each option contract, 
are generally accepted to be less than the "user fees" the CFTC 
probably would have assessed to conduct similar activities. 
  In the past 12 years, the combination of self-regulation by 
the exchanges and the NFA has provided a very efficient and 
cost- effective supplement to government regulation. 
  At this critical period in the development of China's 
futures 
industry and futures regulatory system, it may be appropriate to 
consider setting up China's own futures industry self-regulatory 
organization.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Murray] </F>
  [Text] Chongqing, China, May 2 KYODO -- In the late 1970s, 
the Jianshe manufacturing plant, one of the country's leading 
gun makers, faced financial collapse due to a sudden drop in 
military orders. 
  Driven largely by an instinct for survival, Chen Zisheng, 
now 
the factory director, recalls that he and his colleagues decided 
to gamble on making trucks and sewing machines for the civilian 
market. 
  "It was a last-ditch struggle," he explains. 
  What Chen had no way of knowing then was that he was paving 
the way for most of the nation's war industry to make the switch 
from armaments to consumer goods in the changed environment of 
global detente and the Chinese adoption of a market economy. 
  Jianshe, eventually, was lucky to establish a link with the 
Japanese motorcycle manufacturer Yamaha, which has been a 
lucrative partnership for both sides. 
  Yamaha continues to pour big investment into the venture to 
build new assembly lines turning Jianshe into the country's 
second biggest motorcycle producer, lagging only behind another 
Chongqing-based company, Jialing, which was hived off from the 
Norinco (China North Industries) arms manufacturing group and 
was able to form a technical cooperation agreement with Honda. 
Together they produce 1.3 million machines a year, more than a 
third of China's current output. 
  Jialing alone will be producing one million machines a year 
by 1997. 
  It is an amazing turnaround for China, given its long 
obsession with national security and perceived threats from all 
directions. 
  In order to prepare for national defense in the 1960s, when 
China seemed to face a threat from the Soviet Union and the 
United States (plus the U.S.-backed nationalist forces on 
Taiwan), the best talent, the most advanced technology and 
equipment, with unlimited funds was concentrating on 
establishing a complete defense industry in the remote 
mountainous areas of inland provinces, notably Sichuan, Hunan, 
Yunnan and Guizhou. 
  Meticulous government planning used to guard military 
manufacturers from worries such as supply of materials, funds 
and market conditions. But as the threat of war eased, the 
central government decided to put an end to the wartime footing 
of the military in the 1970s, and in the early 1980s to trim one 
million soldiers from the bloated People's Liberation Army (PLA). 
  Orders for weapons and ammunition fell sharply, and, to 
survive, much of the defense industry was told to forget the 
guns and start thinking about producing something more mundane 
-- like refrigerators and color television sets. 
  The government strategy for the conversion was to set up so- 
called "window enterprises" in the special economic zones and 
other experimental coastal economic development zones during the 
1980s to introduce foreign technology and capital for the 
development of a limited range of 100 products. These window 
enterprises then became information centers and bridgeheads for 
the inland ordnance enterprises to develop an export-oriented 
economy. 
  The changeover seems to have worked. Over the past decade, 
the defense industry in southwest China has manufactured four 
million motorcycles, nearly 500,000 refrigerators, about 700,000 
cameras, over 100,000 minibuses and 1,000 heavy trucks. 
  It is reported that 70 percent of China's defense plants are 
now turning out products for civilian use. The industry as a 
whole has a target of manufacturing civilian goods valued at 10 
billion yuan in 1995. 
  Honda's partner, Norinco, one of the country's biggest 
military suppliers, has diversified so much that 70 percent of 
the output of its 300 units and subsidiaries is civilian goods. 
It has even brought the amusement arcade concept to war through 
the operation of a unique weapons range north of Beijing where 
paying customers can shoot everything from hand guns to antitank 
rockets. 
  Now it is looking for foreign joint venture parts for at 
least 200 projects in advanced machinery, motor vehicle 
assembly, optical, electrical and chemical products. An 
official of its development planning department acknowledged 
that Norinco was hindered by having many of its manufacturing 
plants located in remote interior regions, but this could be 
overcome by moving them to central or coastal areas. 
  The former mayor of Chongqing -- wartime capital of 
nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek -- used to refer to defense 
industry as "a tiger sleeping in the remote mountains." City 
officials have now turned that round to describe the current 
transformation as involving a "tiger leaping down the mountains." 
  There have been no shortage of foreign takers given the 
loving care lavished in the past on companies in the military 
sector. At least 20 joint ventures have been created, primarily 
in vehicle manufacturing. And the Japanese connection in this 
military-to- civilian transformation is extremely strong. 
  Apart from those already mentioned, another success has been 
the Jiangling machinery plant, which switched from military 
hardware to the production of car engines with technological 
help from Suzuki Motors. It is now the city's number two engine 
maker, its main customer being the Changan machinery factory, 
which produces minicars with Honda. 
  The transition from swords to plowshares, however, has not 
always been smooth. Ni Runfeng, director of the Changhong 
machinery plant, a military radar producer, in Mianyang, a 
remote city in eastern Sichuan, recalled how he was caught in a 
vice between higher-ups demanding he convert to civilian 
production and military workers who refused assignments to new 
workshops set up to produce television sets. 
  But that is now a distant memory. After more than a decade 
of technical cooperation with Japan's National Panasonic Corp. 
(Matsushita) has laid a solid foundation for Changhong's 
upgrading. 
  Their self-designed color television production line 
introduced in 1989 as the first of its kind in the country is 
regarded as up to the quality of imported lines and now poses a 
serious challenge to Matsushita's own factories. 
  Having won a firm footing in Southeast Asia and Eastern 
Europe, Changhong set up a joint venture in Indonesia to produce 
300,000 television sets annually. It has been turned into a 
stock company -- Changhong Electric Appliances Co. -- and with 
two new color television assembly lines added to the existing 
six, the company ranked first in production and profits in the 
nation's electronics industry for four successive years 
(1989-92).

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (CNS) -- Information on the 
general situation of agricultural production across the country 
released by the Ministry of Agriculture indicated that the 
harvest of summer crops would be promising but problems 
regarding land under spring cultivation should not be overlooked. 
  Surveys on the spring cultivation conducted by six 
investigative teams sent by the State Council to 13 provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities showed that the situation 
was generally good with a return to normal of the area for the 
growing of early paddy rice and a rise in area of land under the 
cultivation of cotton. The summer crops and summer oil-bearing 
seeds have taken a turn for the better. So long as there are no 
abnormal weather conditions and proper management is in place, a 
big harvest of summer crops is expected while production of 
summer oil crops is tending to increase. 
  Problems of the spring cultivation lie mainly in first, too 
great a rise in prices for production means for agriculture, 
especially quality chemical fertilizer. Second, some 
agricultural production means, particularly quality chemical 
fertilizer is in rather great demand and its supply is 
relatively in a tense state. Third, difficulties are being 
found in keeping steady a certain area under grain cultivation 
while it is proving difficult to achieve the expected area for 
production of cotton. The total area under cultivation of grain 
and cotton therefore continues to decline this year. Fourth, 
implementation of the loans policy set by the central 
authorities for economic development in some major counties 
where commodity grain and cotton are produced is proceeding at a 
slow pace.

  [Text] The four-day provincial meeting on the work of 
opening to the outside world satisfactorily ended on 28 April. 
Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered an important report entitled "Comprehensively 
Implement the Strategy of Bringing Along the Export-oriented 
Economy, and Pushing Shandong's Economy Onto Another New Stage." 
In his report, he stressed the necessity of comprehensively 
carrying out the strategy of bringing along the export-oriented 
economy with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even 
greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the province, presided over the 
meeting held on the morning of 28 April. 
  At the meeting, Jiang Chunyun dwelt on 10 issues as follows: 
First, the issue of understanding. Jiang Chunyun said: In 
opening even wider to the outside world and developing an open 
economy, the most important thing is to further emancipate the 
mind and enhance the understanding of cadres at all levels and 
leading comrades, in particular. The degree of the emancipation 
of mind decides the broadness and quality of opening up. 
  Second, the issue of goals. Jiang Chunyun said: To push the 
entire economy onto a new stage, we must first push the open 
economy onto a new stage. We must place opening up in an even 
more conspicuous position closely around the strategic goal on 
promoting the provincial economy and social development in three 
steps. We must start and promote opening up comprehensively and 
make breakthroughs in all areas to develop the scale and level 
of opening up extensively, in an effort to rapidly link 
Shandong's economy with the world market. In line with this 
general demand, we should effect a new and even greater progress 
in all fields of open economy, including export, earnings of 
foreign exchange, utilization of foreign capital, renovation of 
old enterprises through grafting, foreign-funded enterprises of 
three types, tourism, labor cooperation with the outside world, 
the contacts with the world market, training and absorbing of 
professionals, and economic cooperation with other provinces and 
regions. 
  Third, the issue of overall pattern. Jiang Chunyun said: 
The opening up strategy, defined by the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, known as opening all 
fields to the outside world, making breakthroughs in major 
areas, pressing forward the economy level by level, combining 
the East with the West, and commonly developing the economy, is 
commensurate with the realities of Shandong, and remarkable 
results have already been achieved in the practice of this 
strategy. Thus, this strategy should be carried out vigorously 
and continuously. In developing the economy, we should give 
prominence to the overall promotion and coordinated development. 
The head of the dragon should be raised, its body should float 
in the air, and its tail should sway so that we can truly form 
an overall pattern of the development of open economy of 
Shandong. 
  Fourth, the issue of structure. We should give prominence to 
the readjustment of the structures of industries, trades, and 
export products. 
  Fifth, the issue of systems. Jiang Chunyun said: At 
present, many of our systems are not appropriate and lag far 
behind the demands of the international practice. We must 
regard the difficult points hampering opening up as the focal 
points of the deepening of reform and readjust whichever is 
inappropriate so that we can instill new vitality to the 
province's open economy. 
  Sixth, the issue of professionals. Jiang Chunyun said: The 
lack of professional personnel has become a major obstacle to 
the invigoration of Shandong's open economy. Therefore, we must 
adopt feasible measures to accelerate the training of 
professional personnel and accelerate the development of 
intellectual resources. We should open wide the province's gate 
to the outside world and encourage the personnel studying 
abroad, the students of Shandong origin in particular, to return 
to the province to work after completing their studies abroad. 
We should pay attention to attracting retired overseas 
high-technology experts, engineering and technological experts, 
and economic management experts to the province to work and 
encourage them to make contributions to Shandong's economic 
development. 
  Seventh, the environment issue. Jiang Chunyun said: We 
should make great efforts to improve the environment for opening 
the province to the outside world. In the field of tangible 
environment, we should further strengthen the building of 
airports, communications facilities, railways, highways, ports, 
and power plants. In the field of intangible environment, we 
should attach importance on building up a fine-quality and 
high-efficient administrative service system, a policy and 
regulation system involving foreign nationals and foreign 
affairs that tallies with the international practice, and a 
sensitive and fast information system. Meanwhile, we should pay 
attention to comprehensive management of social order, create a 
healthy social atmosphere aimed at forging ahead, and form a 
fine social environment in which foreign traders are willing to 
make investment in the province and do business at ease. 
  Eighth, the issue of rules and regulations. Jiang Chunyun 
said: In opening to the outside world, we should not open 
ourselves arbitrarily, nor should we stop managing anything. We 
must make clear what should be allowed, encouraged, opposed, and 
restricted in opening up. 
  Ninth, the issue of study. Jiang Chunyun said: In the 
process of shifting from a planned economy to the market economy 
and from the domestic market to the world market, we are 
confronted with many new circumstances and problems. All people 
with professions and trades at all levels in the province should 
be determined to study again and study assiduously in order to 
improve their level and ability of commanding the 
export-oriented economy, the market economy, and the 
modernization drive and to improve their skills to lead the open 
economy. 
  Tenth, the leadership issue. Jiang Chunyun said: Party 
committees and governments at all levels in the province should 
list the opening to the outside world as an important item on 
their daily agenda, should pay attention to mapping out 
strategies, plans, goals, principles, and policies, should be 
meticulous in researching situations, should adopt policy 
decisions in a timely manner, and should conscientiously 
organize the implementation of these policy decisions. All 
localities, departments, and units should enhance their 
consciousness in opening to all directions, should foster the 
idea of handling foreign affairs and developing foreign economic 
relations and foreign trade on a large scale, should voluntarily 
cooperate and coordinate with one another, and should bring 
their own development into line with the overall pattern of 
opening up. 
  In conclusion, Jiang Chunyun stressed that the province's 
reform, opening up, and economic development is at a critical 
moment. In particular, the success or failure in our work in 
this and next year is of a decisive significance to the 
province's economic and social development in the future. We 
should comprehensively carry out the strategy of bringing along 
an export-oriented economy and increase the dynamics of opening 
up with even greater courage and resourcefulness, with even 
greater boldness of vision, and with even more solid measures in 
a bid to push the province's economy onto another new stage.

  [Text] The provincial party committee held a rural work 
conference in Jinan on 29 April. 
  In his speech, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, urged that the people from higher levels 
downward across the province should concentrate greater energy 
on grasping the 1994 agricultural and rural work; focus on 
increasing the supply of farm products and the income of the 
peasants; stabilize grain production; ensure cotton production; 
increase economic results; and ensure a stable increase in 
grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, an overall increase in the 
rural economy, and a big increase in the income of the peasants. 
  Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the provincial government, chaired the 
conference. Present at the conference were some provincial 
Leaders, including Li Chunting, Li Wenquan, and Li Zhen; and 
responsible comrades of the prefectural, city, and county party 
committees and provincial-, city- and prefectural-level 
departments concerned. 
  According to the opinions made by the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, Jiang Chunyun talked 
about eight issues as follows. 
  First, stabilize the production of grain, cotton, 
oil-bearing 
crops, and vegetables and effectively ensure the supply for 
society. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: The province's main agricultural 
production tasks in 1994 are to stabilize the production of 
grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops; to restore cotton 
production; and to enrich vegetable baskets. Cotton production 
is the province's most important agricultural task for this 
year. The provincial party committee and the provincial 
government urged that the party and government departments at 
various levels should regard the planting of good and sufficient 
cotton as an arduous economic task as well as a serious 
political task. We should continue to carry out the system of 
leaders assuming responsibility for cotton production and regard 
that whether or not the localities can plant sufficient amounts 
of good cotton and capture bumper cotton harvests as an 
important content of assessing [words indistinct] cadres. 
  Second, comprehensively develop the rural economy and 
increase, by a big margin, the income of the peasants. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Striving to increase the peasants 
of the peasants by a big margin at the time of ensuring a stable 
increase in the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops is an urgent, prominent agricultural and rural work task 
for this year. To this end, we should positively readjust and 
optimize the rural industrial structure and the rural product 
mix and increase the economic results of agriculture. 
  Third, ceaselessly deepen the rural reform and inject new 
vitality to the development of agriculture and the rural economy. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: To further mobilize the peasants' 
enthusiasm for production, we must make a new breakthrough in 
reforming the property right system. We should strengthen the 
setup of the (?land turnover) system and positively carry out 
the shareholding system. Barren mountain areas, barren beaches, 
wasteland, and undeveloped coastal areas can either be developed 
on a contracted or leasing basis or be auctioned for 
development. It is necessary to guide the broad masses of the 
peasants to enter markets. 
  Fourth, realistically strengthen the buildup of agricultural 
scientific and technological front and vigorously popularize 
agricultural sciences and technologies. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: We should regard the improvement 
of the peasants' scientific and educational quality as a 
fundamentally great matter for rejuvenating agriculture with 
science and education and comprehensively upgrade the peasants' 
scientific and educational quality. 
  Fifth, continue to support the poor, to make development, 
and 
to ensure the realization of the fourth five-year plan for 
supporting the poor. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Recently, the province worked out the 
fourth five-year plan for supporting the poor. That is, the 
province should concentrate five years of time to solve the 
problems relating to four million people's food and clothes. 
This indicates that our province has entered the last stage of 
the project for supporting the poor and making development with 
the purpose of providing sufficient food and clothes for the 
people. 
  Sixth, strengthen agriculture's role as the foundation of 
the 
national economy and do our best to serve agriculture. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: In line with their actual conditions, 
all trades and professions and all departments should generally 
examine their aid-agriculture work, affirm their achievements, 
find out where they lag behind, study and formulate measures for 
improvement, and conscientiously attend to the implementation of 
the measures. 
  Seventh, implement overall measures and ensure the stability 
of the rural areas. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Nineteen ninety-four is the key 
year of reform. So, it is of peculiar importance to 
safeguarding the stability of society. According to the 
existing [words indistinct] as well as [words indistinct] that 
will possibly crop up, the leading comrades at various levels 
should persist in the policy of taking a two-hand approach and 
being sure that both hands are tough and positively and actively 
do their work jobs. 
  Eighth, strengthen the setup of the rural basic 
organizations 
to provide a reliable guarantee for agriculture and the rural 
work. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: The prefectural and county party 
committees should concentrate their main energy on the rural 
work. Secretaries, majors, commissioners, and county heads of 
the localities that fail to promote the production of major farm 
products, such as grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, and 
vegetables; and have problems in supply of these products, 
should be called to account. It is necessary to persist in the 
principle of seeking truth from facts, to resolutely overcome 
formalism and bureaucracy, and to strictly ban exaggerations and 
false reports. The grass roots should report to higher levels 
both good and bad news, and [words indistinct]. 
  Responsible persons of five prefectures and cities and two 
provincial-level departments made speeches at the conference. 
  Before the conclusion of the conference, Zhao Zhihao, 
governor of the provincial government, made a speech. 
  In his speech, he urged that all localities and all 
departments should conscientiously implement the guidelines of 
this conference and ensure there are ideology, tasks, measures, 
and leadership. 
  In regard to the current production, Zhao Zhihao said: The 
most important agricultural production task is to grasp cotton 
sowing work. We should try every possible means to fulfill the 
cotton sowing plan. He also reminded all localities to grasp 
the management of wheat field in the later stage, to make 
earlier preparations for planting, harvesting, and field 
management, and to ensure a bumper summer grain harvest.

  [Text] On 1 May, while handling affairs at the Shandong 
Academy of Agricultural Science, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, stressed: To push agriculture onto 
a new stage, we must first push agriculture-oriented science and 
technology onto a new level. All levels of party, government, 
and agricultural departments should, without exception, put the 
agriculture-oriented science and technology in the first place 
and make a great breakthrough in research, development, and 
utilization of agriculture-oriented science and technology. 
  Comrade Jiang Chunyun has been extremely concerned with the 
work of agriculture-oriented science and technology. Since 
1986, he has traveled to the provincial academy of agriculture 
science on four occasions to conduct investigations, resolve 
problems, and guide the work. 
  Early on the morning of 1 May, Jiang Chunyun and Vice 
Governor Wang Jiangong again led responsible persons of 
pertinent provincial-level departments to this academy to handle 
affairs on the spot. They viewed the vegetable research 
institute, the central laboratory, the crop science and 
technology development department, the institute for research in 
atomic energy application, and the wheat varieties exhibition 
center of the academy. They asked questions while viewing and 
highly praised many high science and technology items that were 
under researches. 
  When seeing the wheat grinder that is advanced in the world, 
Jiang Chunyun encouraged (Zhao Zhidong), researcher of the 
vegetable research institute, to seek cooperation with foreign 
traders and try the best to bring in, master, and apply advanced 
foreign technologies in an effort to develop and produce the 
advanced agriculture-oriented scientific and technological 
equipment of our own. 
  On 1 May, International Laborers' Day, Jiang Chunyun 
extended 
festive greetings to hard-working scientific and technological 
workers wherever he went, and extended cordial regards and lofty 
respects to laborers on all fronts of the province on behalf of 
the provincial party committee and the provincial government. 
  While handling affairs on the spot, Jiang Chunyun also 
conscientiously listened to the reports made by (Xie Yunchun), 
secretary of the party committee of the provincial academy of 
agricultural science, and by (Wang Dagang), president of the 
academy. Then, he delivered a speech on how to further develop 
the province's agriculture-oriented science and technology. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: Now, the province's agriculture 
is precisely at the critical moment of embarking on a new stage. 
To develop a high-yield, fine-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture, we must depend to a large extent on science and 
technology, In developing agriculture, we must depend on 
science and technology to resolve problems. He called on top 
party and government leaders at all levels to pay attention to 
the primary productive force, put the agriculture-oriented 
science and technology in the first place, actually grasp the 
research, development, and application of agriculture-oriented 
science and technology with a view to promoting the large-scale 
development of agriculture. 
  Jiang Chunyun also expressed hope that the provincial 
academy 
of agriculture science would carry forward achievements and 
advance on the crest of a victory. In the next step, the 
academy should make a new breakthrough in research of 
agricultural science, should, in particular, achieve even more 
notable results in the research of biological projects, should 
make a new breakthrough in development, popularization, and 
application of advanced technologies, and should translate even 
more scientific and technological research results into 
practical productive forces. At the same time, the academy 
should make a new breakthrough in studying and introducing 
advanced domestic and world technologies in order to make even 
greater contributions to accelerating the progress of the 
provincial agriculture-oriented science and technology and 
promoting the large-scale development of agriculture.

  [Text] Jinan, April 30 (XINHUA)--Soaring foreign investment 
over the past few years has spurred economic development in 
Shandong in East China, earning 35 percent of the province's 
hard currency, a provincial official said today. 
  In 1993, the official said, Shandong Province approved 8,012 
foreign-funded projects with 7.55 billion U.S. dollars in 
investment, equivalent to the total amount for the previous 14 
years. 
  These enterprises, he said, produced nine percent of the 
total industrial output value and the foreign investment in 
these firms makes up 14.8 percent of the total capital 
investment in fixed assets. 
  Foreign investment has also brought in advanced technology 
and facilities to help improve the industrial set-up of 
state-owned enterprises. In 1993, some 30 percent of aging 
enterprises or nearly 10,000 aging enterprises benefited from 
technical renovations with the help of foreign investment. 
  Yantai city, for instance, attracted 790 million U.S. 
dollars 
to renovate 55 percent of the enterprises above county level. 
  Up to now, over one million people in the province have 
found 
jobs in foreign-funded enterprises. "Shandong cannot experience 
such rapid economic development and profound improvement in 
people's living standards without foreign investment," said Zhao 
Zhihao, the provincial governor.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 1 (XINHUA)--The Shanghai municipal 
rules on implementation of the land-use law of the People's 
Republic of China came into effect today. 
  According to the 76-article rules, all companies, 
enterprises, organizations and individuals except those covered 
by special laws and regulations, are allowed to receive the 
right of land use through the form of assignment for the purpose 
of development, utilization or business. In addition, all 
commercial projects including those involving foreign investment 
should transfer the right of land use through public bidding or 
auction rather than through negotiations as has most often been 
done in the past. 
  An authoritative official noted that with the implementation 
of the new rules, the practice of combining free utilization of 
land with paid use has been replaced by paid use for all 
utilization of land in the city. 
  Meanwhile, the official said, the Shanghai municipal 
government will continue to list more fields in land use besides 
commercial housing for foreign businessmen to invest in.

  [Text] Leaders of the provincial party committee and its 
office working personnel have bought state treasury bonds with 
enthusiasm over the last few days. According to statistics, the 
office working personnel of the provincial party committee 
already have subscribed for the bonds worth 354,700 yuan or so, 
or an average per capita subscription of 300 yuan or more. 
  To promote state treasury bond subscription work, on 14 
April 
the general office of the provincial party committee held a 
special meeting of persons in charge of units directly under the 
provincial party committee and appointed selected persons to be 
responsible for the work and to contact banks, asking them to 
set up a distribution center in the office of the provincial 
party committee on 23 April. 
  Principal leaders of the provincial party committee not only 
took the lead in subscribing for state treasury bonds, but also 
attached great importance to the work of subscribing for state 
treasury bonds. They have repeatedly instructed that it is 
necessary to mobilize the masses of people to subscribe for 
state treasury bonds. Xie Fei, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, pointed out at a recent provincial study class for 
city party committee secretaries that it is necessary to 
mobilize cadres and the masses of people to buy state treasury 
bonds energetically. This is a glorious task of making 
contributions to the state. Standing committee members of the 
provincial party committee and members of the leading bodies of 
units directly under the committee should take the lead in 
buying state treasury bonds so as to help bring the bond 
subscription work to a climax. It is necessary to organize 
forces to give wide publicity to the work, set up more 
distribution centers, do the work at subscribers' doorsteps, and 
make the work convenient for the masses of people. One should

  [Text] Led by Governor Zhu Senlin; Vice Governors Lu 
Ruihua, Li Lanfang, and Ou Guangyuan; and other leaders; close 
to 300 working personnel of the government general office went 
this afternoon to the state treasury bond distribution center of 
the Bank of Construction provincial branch, which was located in 
the provincial government building, and enthusiastically bought 
state treasury bonds. In an interview with a station 
correspondent after buying state treasury bonds, Governor Zhu 
Senlin said: Issuing national bonds is an important move taken 
by the party Central Committee and the State Council to 
alleviate the state's financial difficulties and to ensure the 
development of key national construction projects and 
undertakings. It has a direct bearing on the overall situation 
of reform, development, and stability. He remarked: State 
treasury bonds bear interest higher than that offerred by banks; 
they will benefit individuals. The governor urged party and 
government leaders of all cities and counties to take the lead 
in buying state treasury bonds. 
  According to statistics, the provincial government office 
working personnel this morning subscribed for state treasury 
bonds worth 100,000 yuan or so in all. Provincial leaders who 
were away from the province on official business subscribed for 
state treasury bonds by telephone. Ye Jianping, vice chairman 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, asked 
his secretary to subscribe for the bonds on his behalf.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 30 (XINHUA)--The 75th Guangzhou 
Export Commodity Fair closed today, setting a record transaction 
volume with an increase of 12 percent. 
  Officials in charge of the fair gave no account of the 
concrete transaction volume, but the transaction of new and fine 
light industrial and petrochemical products, machinery and 
electronic products made the greatest increases. 
  The fair registered the attendance of 49,863 overseas 
businessmen from 145 countries and regions, 2,839 persons more 
than the last fair. 
  In spite of the effect of the recent Qiandao Lake tourist 
boat accident, 4,075 Taiwanese businessmen, 14 percent more than 
the last fair, came to the fair, organizing officials said. 
  The number of Japanese businessmen decreased by 3 percent to 
2,802, partly due to the inactive internal economy of Japan. 
  The transaction volume between Chinese commodity exporters 
and Hong Kong and Macao businessmen accounted for 33.3 percent 
of the total, the officials said.

  [Text] Chengdu, May 1 (XINHUA)--Sichuan, China's most 
populous province and largest producer of grain and edible oil, 
is expected to have a bumper harvest this summer. 
  The provincial agricultural department predicts that wheat 
output will reach that of 1992, a record year, and rapeseed 
output will increase by 10 percent over last year. 
  Sichuan's grain and edible oil output decreased last year. 
Since the beginning of this year, local governments have 
attached more importance to agriculture and taken measures to 
lessen the burden on farmers. 
  Meanwhile, the provincial government has sent some 100 
experts to the countryside, who, together with 25,000 
agronomists working at the county and township levels, have 
helped local farmers to manage 2.33 million hectares of 
farmland, 30 percent of the province's crop-growing areas. 
  The local governments are now working out purchasing prices 
for wheat and rapeseed. Local farmers say that they expect 
higher and more reasonable prices for their products. 
  The rapeseed output of the province makes up 17 percent of 
the national total. The provincial government expects to 
purchase 400 million kg of edible oil this summer, half of which 
will go to the rest of the country. Local officials say that a 
good harvest in the province would stabilize the country's 
edible oil market.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Regional News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] At the first Tibet regional forum on intellectuals 
work on the afternnon of 27 April, Guo Jinlong, deputy secretary 
of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, pointed out 
that, in the new situation, party committees and governments at 
all levels should further improve intellectuals work and bring 
their role into full play. 
  The forum will sum up the work of Tibet's intellectuals in 
the preceding period, exchange experience in intellectuals' 
work, discuss the building of an intellectual work force in 
Tibet, and define the future tasks of Tibet's intellectuals 
work. Guo Jinlong said: Social practice and Tibet's natural 
environment have endowed Tibet's intellectuals with a special 
ability to combat, work hard, be patient, and dedicate 
themselves. Over the years, Tibet's intellectuals, undaunted by 
hardships and not seeking personal fame and interests, have 
quietly dedicated their youth and talents to Tibet's socialist 
construction and reform and opening up. They have made 
indelible historical contributions to Tibet's economic 
development and development and progress in science. 
  Guo Jinlong pointed out: The 14th CPC National Congress set 
accelerating scientific and technological progress, forcefully 
developing education, and bringing intellectuals' role into full 
play as one of the 10 major tasks that will decide China's 
socialist modernization work in the 1990's. This fully 
indicates that the party attaches great importance to 
intellectuals work. The work of the party's intellectuals is a 
regular and long-term task. Leading cadres at all levels and 
comrades engaging in intellectual work should have an in-depth 
understanding of the party's policy toward intellectuals; adhere 
to the party's basic appraisal of and basic policy toward 
intellectuals; and faithfully carry out the party's policy that 
intellectuals should be treated equally politically, be made use 
of freely, and that the party should show concern for 
intellectuals' daily life. 
  We should list the work on intellectuals as an important 
agendum of party committees and governments at various levels, 
and truly trust and rely on the broad masses of intellectuals. 
It is necessary to continually explore new ways and methods of 
handling Tibet's intellectual work under new circumstances. We 
should resolve one or two specific problems for intellectuals 
annually in an effort to create conditions and an environment in 
which talented people will show themselves. 
  Deputy Secretary Guo Jinlong stressed: Party committees and 
governments at various levels should pay attention to, respect, 
show concern for, and cherish talented people. We should 
intensify the development of and the education about 
intellectuals in accordance with the policy of making them more 
revolutionary, younger in their average age, better educated, 
and professionally more competent. We should boldly promote 
outstanding intellectuals who are politically reliable and 
professionally competent and who possess a certain level of 
organizational management skills, and place them in appropriate 
leading or management positions. Furthermore, we should 
continually improve the special technical and vocational 
employment system, strengthen the assessment of special 
technicians, and create a competitive mechanism that is 
stimulating and progressive. In addition, we should strengthen 
the building of a professional work force, expand undertakings 
for selecting and appointing personnel, and cultivate a good 
social practice across the whole society under which knowledge 
and talented people are respected so that Tibet's contingent of 
professionals will develop more healthily. 
  Also speaking at the meeting were (Lu Huiming), member of 
the 
autonomous regional party committee Standing Committee and 
organization department director, and (Cideng Pingcuo), deputy 
director of the autonomous regional party committee's 
organization department.

  [Text] Abulaiti Abudurexiti, chairman of the regional 
government, yesterday afternoon presided over the 25th executive 
meeting of the Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional 
People's Government. The meeting transmitted the guidelines of 
the State Council meeting on anticorruption and heard reports on 
the state of the anticorruption struggle launched in this region 
since August. The meeting also put forward specific demands for 
anticorruption efforts in various government departments this 
year. 
  Zhou Shengtao, member of the Standing Committee of the 
regional party committee and secretary of the regional 
commission for discipline inspection; Yusufu Aisha, vice 
chairman of the regional government; and other leading comrades 
attended the meeting. 
  Chairman Abulaiti Abudurexiti said: Since the major policy 
decision made by the party Central Committee last August on 
launching the anticorruption struggle, governments at various 
levels in the autonomous region have attached great importance 
to launching the struggle and have promptly made arrangements in 
line with the central guidelines. We have achieved initial good 
results in the anticorruption struggle. However, we must also 
realize that the progress of our anticorruption struggle still 
cannot keep up with the expectations of the broad masses. The 
problem of the unhealthy tendencies of various trades and 
professions has not been fundamentally solved, and the people 
are still making complaints. This shows that the anticorruption 
task is still very heavy, and so we must further strengthen our 
leadership over the task. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: We must further deepen the 
anticorruption work this year and grasp the work in a solid 
manner. First, we must continue to implement the five provisions 
put forward by the party Central Committee last year to ensure 
honesty in performing official duties by cadres at and above the 
county, department, and bureau level. Second, we must implement 
the five new provisions put forward by the party Central 
Committee this year. A small number of leading comrades who have 
not seriously carried out self-examination must take the 
initiative to check their own behavior this year. Those who 
have found irregularities but have not corrected the situation 
must make corrections in a prompt manner. 
  Abulaiti Abudurexiti emphatically said: The key for leading 
cadres' practicing self-discipline and being honest lies in 
raising their consciousness. They should take lead in 
implementing the first and second of the five provisions put 
forward by the party Central Committee. They should adopt 
effective measures to ensure honesty in performing official 
duties in light of the existing problems. On the issue of 
investigating and handling cases of violating law and 
discipline, we must lay stress on investigating and handling 
cases of violating law and discipline by cadres of leading 
organs and judicial, administrative, and economic management 
departments. We should let the masses see that we are resolved 
to seriously solve the problem and realize the determination and 
strength of our party and government in punishing corruption. 
  In conclusion, Abulaiti Abudurexiti asked leading cadres at 
various levels to carry forward the fine traditions of the 
party, be faithful public servants for the people, foster news 
customs of being honest in performing their official duties, 
create a good social environment, and make new contributions to 
accelerating the pace of reform and opening up and to promoting 
the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.

enterprises, including 27 joint ventures. 
  It created profits worth 110 million yuan (12.5 million U.S. 
dollars according to the current exchange rate) and handed over 
7.5 million yuan (about 850,000 U.S. dollars) to the state in 
taxes last year. 
  Local government has invested 80 million yuan (nine million 
U.S. dollars) in infrastructure construction in the zone. 
  Construction of infrastructural facilities in a diamond city

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 30 (XINHUA) -- [A] fourth man was 
arrested on Thursday [28 April] afternoon for being involved in 
the Qiandao Lake accident, in which 24 Taiwanese aboard a 
tourist boat were robbed and killed. 
  Wu Liming, the elder brother of Wu Lihong, one of the three 
suspects directly involved in the crime, was arrested at his 
home in Xinanjiang town, Jiande city, in east Zhejiang Province 
for allegedly helping his bother hide part of the robbed money. 
  Wu Lihong, together with Hu Zhihan, [and] Yu Aijun robbed 
the 
24 Taiwan tourists aboard the "Hairui" boat, then touring the 
lake in Chunan County, and killed them and the eight staff later 
in an [act of] arson on March 31. Later they divided the robbed 
money and articles between them and hid them in their houses. 
  Several days after the accident, spokesman of the Public 
Security Bureau of the Chunan County said, Wu Liming learned 
that his brother hid in home the money and things he had robbed 
from a pleasure-boat, but instead of reporting that to the 
authorities, he helped his brother to transfer and hide part of 
the robbed U.S. and Taiwanese dollars in his own home in Jiande 
city. 
  Police had recovered the hidden money in Wu Liming's house, 
the spokesman said. 
  The three suspects directly involving in the case of murder

<F P=106> [Commentary by Guo Taiwen (6753 31412429): "The Undermining </F>
of the Relations Between the Two Sides of the Taiwan Strait Is 
Not Popular"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Thirty-two compatriots 
from the two sides of the strait died in the exceptionally 
serious case of murder, robbery, and boat destruction which 
occurred on Qiandao Lake. The people on both sides of the 
strait feel the same pain for the unfortunate deaths of the 
compatriots; they are happy that the case has been solved; and 
compatriots on both sides of the strait are similarly indignant 
at the crime perpetrated by the suspects. The feelings of our 
fraternal compatriots cannot be separated. 
  None of the compatriots on both sides of the strait wanted 
this unfortunate incident to happen. However, the unfortunate 
incident has happened. After the grief, the first important 
thing to do should be to try every means to quickly crack the 
case and to punish the criminals in order to calm the people's 
indignation. In fact, the public security departments and other 
relevant organs in Zhejiang have acted in this way. Under the 
concern of the Central Committee and the State Council and with 
the vigorous assistance of the masses, the public security 
cadres and police worked very hard and cracked the case in 17 
days. The people on both sides of the strait felt some relief 
after hearing this. 
  However, people have also noticed that after the incident 
occurred, excitement lingered for quite a while on the island of 
Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities and the "Taiwan independence" 
movement seized the opportunity to exaggerate matters and create 
incidents. Before the case was investigated, they spread all 
kinds of rumors, created public opinion, and unscrupulously 
fanned resentment among the people, and after exploiting the 
incident again and again, they turned a criminal case into a 
political matter, thus whipping up quite a big upsurge in 
undermining cross-strait relations. 
  People have noticed that a person of high standing in Taiwan 
shouted abuse at the Communist Party by employing remarks that 
have not been used in decades. This was clearly an incident 
committed by bad people, but some people slandered the mainland 
authorities as "treating human life as if it were not worth a 
straw and ignoring human rights." This was followed by calls 
for the temporary suspension of the tourism trade, of commerce, 
of exchanges, and of cross-strait talks on routine matters, as 
well as calls for "a boycott" and "sanctions." A small number 
of "Taiwan independence" elements, thinking that there was an 
opportunity to exploit, once again openly called for "Taiwan 
independence." 
  People cannot but ask: What do they want? 
  The answer is clear: They want to undermine the good 
relations between the two sides of the strait. 
  Developing cross-strait relations to realize peaceful 
reunification is the common desire of the people on both sides 
of the strait. In the past few years, it was the common efforts 
of the people of both sides that have enabled cross-strait 
relations to develop rapidly. However, it should also be noted 
that there are some people who go against the desire of the 
masses. These people do not want to see cross-strait relations 
continue to develop. They invariably try to find some pretext 
to stop the relations from developing. After the "Qiandao Lake 
incident" occurred, they thought that they had found an 
opportunity to exaggerate matters. Therefore, they brought all 
their skill into play and staged a vivid performance. However, 
their performance has thoroughly exposed their true features of 
undermining the relations between the two sides of the strait. 
  It should be pointed that some people on the island who did 
not know the truth acted too excitedly or made excessively 
improper remarks because of their indignation over the 
criminals. This is normal human nature. Their frame of mind is 
understandable. However, there are a small number of people with 
ulterior motives who vainly attempted to exploit the incited 
sentiments to realize their despicable purpose of undermining 
cross-strait relations. The people on both sides of the strait 
should heighten their vigilance against their scheme. 
  It is the trend of the times and the desire of the people to 
realize the peaceful reunification between both sides of the 
strait. No force can obstruct historical currents. To 
accomplish the great cause of the reunification of the 
motherland, the compatriots on both sides of the strait have 
made unremitting efforts; they have done a great deal of work to 
promote fruitful interaction through cross-strait relations. 
Indeed, it has not been easy for cross-strait relations to 
expand to the present level. All people who hope to see China 
reunified should cherish cross-strait relations even more and 
should never allow them to be undermined. A saying goes, "Green 
hills cannot be hidden, and rivers will flow into the sea." The 
relations between both sides of the strait were established by 
hard work by the fraternal compatriots on both sides. Any scheme 
to undermine the relations will be unpopular.

<F P=106> ["News commentary" by station commentator (Yu Xin): "To </F>
Calmly Handle the Shipwreck Incident"; from the "News and 
Current Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] A tragic disaster on the cruiser "Hairui" in 
Zhejiang's Qiandao Lake has led to the deaths of all the 24 
Taiwan tourists and eight mainland tour guides and crew members. 
The unfortunate incident has caused deep sorrow among 
compatriots on both sides of the strait. Relevant mainland 
departments have quickly solved the case, preliminarily 
revealing that it was an extraordinarily serious case of 
robbery, arson, and homicide. Public security organs have 
arrested three culprits who were connected to the case. 
  We believe that truths about the case and the results of 
relevant investigations and handling will be publicized very 
soon. The tragedy forcefully took away 32 compatriots' lives. 
We can understand the indignation expressed by family members 
of the victims. Relevant authorities in charge of handling the 
incident have heard their opinions and requests, and have 
rendered appropriate responses as much as possible. 
  Disasters such as robbery and murder can occur anywhere in 
the world. All governments have been striving in every possible 
way to eliminate such disasters in an effort to attain social 
stability. The Qiandao Lake shipwreck was unmistakably an 
unfortunate incident that was appalling to people on both sides 
of the strait. However, some of the authorities in Taiwan 
simply exaggerated it as a political incident. Taiwan 
independence elements also seized the opportunity to stir up 
troubles. A certain person in power in the ruling party on the 
island even attacked the Chinese communists, likening them to 
bandits. Inciting people's feelings, such extreme words have 
directly promoted Taiwan Independence's momentum on the island. 
  Because the Taiwan authorities purposely politicized the 
Qiandao Lake incident, some people in the government and 
nongovernment sectors have seized the opportunity to stir up 
troubles. They advocated stopping cross-strait exchanges. They 
decided to suspend cross-strait cultural and educational 
exchanges and to stop appraising and approving applications of 
Taiwan investments on the mainland. Beginning 1 May, travel 
agencies will stop handling people's visits to the mainland. 
  Taiwan's mass media pointed out: Taiwan does not have the 
capability [ben qian 2609 6929] to discontinue cross-strait 
exchanges. To stop handling people's visits to the mainland 
alone, some 100 travel agencies in Taibei [Taipei] City will 
lose more than 100 million New Taiwan [NT] dollars. 
  Taiwan's mass media believe: Both sides of the strait have 
carried out very comprehensive economic and trade cooperation. 
Cooperating with the mainland has been beneficial to Taiwan. 
Now that the case has been solved, the Taiwan authorities 
should rationally resume cross-strait exchanges and guide 
cross-strait relations toward a healthy track. 
  Using the Qiandao Lake incident, the Taiwan authorities have 
attempted to obstruct normal cross-strait exchanges and visits, 
to sabotage [po huai 4275 0975] the cross-strait relations that 
have been established by joint efforts of people on both sides 
of the strait in the past several years, and to hamper [sun hai 
2275 1364] the interests of people on both sides of the strait. 
People on both sides of the strait will not allow or consent to 
such activities. Developing cross-strait relations and 
materializing the reunification of the motherland people accord 
with the will of the people and the general trend of events. 
All attempts to move against the tide of history will find it 
hard to prevail.

<F P=106> ["Commentary" by unidentified XINHUA reporter] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- After the major case 
involving robbery, arson, and murder on Qiandao Lake was 
cracked, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait 
[ARATS] sent letters to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation 
[SEF] twice, on 20 and 23 April, inviting the latter to send 
personnel to Hangzhou. These personnel will be accompanied by 
relevant experts who will give briefings on specific situations 
pertaining to the case and answer questions. We have now found 
out from Taiwan media reports that relevant Taiwan authorities 
have been adopting an attitude of procrastination regarding the 
ARATS invitation. People hold that the Taiwan side has been 
urging the Zhejiang side to make public the truth about the case 
after it occurred. Now that the case has been solved, we are 
willing to give a face-to-face briefing on details of the case 
and answer questions -- in addition to having the ARATS provide 
the details -- but the Taiwan side has intentionally been 
procrastinating by not coming, and that is definitely not a wise 
move. 
  According to the ARATS, replies sent to it by the SEF on 21 
and 24 April noted that the SEF is willing to "positively 
consider" the ARATS invitation, but they also said that before 
the SEF decides on the time of arrival in Hangzhou and the list 
of experts who will accompany the trip, the mainland side will 
have to first provide information on how the crime occurred, an 
autopsy report, a report on the crime site, relevant exhibits, 
and answers to questions raised by the Taiwan side about 
doubtful points on the case. 
  People have observed that a large number of items mentioned 
in the SEF replies appear to be preconditions for the SEF's 
coming to Hangzhou. Despite having paid close attention to 
details concerning the case and having indicated that it will 
show understanding toward feelings of the victims' families, the 
Taiwan side has set up preconditions on its coming to Hangzhou 
to directly understand the case and hear answers from relevant 
experts. What is particularly noteworthy is that the SEF has 
repeatedly asked for "relevant exhibits" and other such 
materials used in handling the case. Exhibits of a crime are 
used by public security departments and judicial organs when 
handling cases and passing sentences. It is hard to understand 
why the Taiwan side is requesting such exhibits. Actually, ever 
since the incident occurred, the ARATS has continually informed 
the SEF about progress made in solving the case. Mainland media 
have also made numerous reports on the incident. Most of the 
materials requested by the SEF in its replies have already been 
given to the Taiwan side, and some information can be obtained 
directly by coming to the mainland. Why does the SEF hesitate 
to move forward? 
  People around here believe that the Qiandao Lake case has 
invoked grave concern from compatriots on both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. The death of 32 compatriots has caused deep pain 
among the people. We have finally solved the case now, and the 
murderers will not escape the net of justice. To show its 
sincerity and dispel misunderstanding, the mainland side has 
repeatedly invited the Taiwan side to send people over to hear 
briefings on the case. Its attitude is open and aboveboard, and 
shows that it is seeking truth from facts. However, what merits 
our attention is that a small number of Taiwan people who harbor 
ulterior motives have politicized the criminal case. These 
people, who lack interest in information about the case, which 
is followed closely by Taiwan compatriots and media circles on 
the island, are only fond of spreading continuously the 
so-called "questionable points" and attacking the mainland for 
"concealing" the truth. They are actually trying to continue 
fanning hostility and poison the cross-straits atmosphere in an 
attempt to pull back relations across the Taiwan Strait. This 
matter gives much food for thought for compatriots across the 
strait, the large number of overseas Chinese, and countrymen 
residing abroad, who are all concerned about the development of 
cross-straits relations.

<F P=106> ["Letter from Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Reflections </F>
on the Qiandao Pleasure Boat Fire Incident"] 
  [Text] My dear brother, 
  I heard an unfortunate piece of news from Chunan County, 
Zhejiang Province, that on the afternoon of 31 March, a fire 
started on a pleasure boat when cruising Qiandao Lake with 24 
Taiwan compatriots, two local tour guides, and six crew members 
aboard, killing everyone on board. Like Taiwan people, we were 
shocked and grief-stricken when the bad news arrived. We hoped 
sincerely that there would be full cooperation between 
authorities on both sides of the strait in handling this 
unfortunate incident and dealing properly with its aftermath, 
making sure that this tourist misadventure would not affect 
relations across the straits. 
  After the incident, from what information I could gather, I 
think that concerned mainland authorities are handling this 
matter seriously. The State Council persons-in-charge, its 
Taiwan Affairs Office, National Tourism Administration, and 
Zhejiang Provincial Government and concerned departments, have 
taken the tourist accident very seriously. Luo Gan, State 
Council General Office secretary general, instructed Zhejiang 
Province officials on the morning of 2 April to quickly find out 
the cause of the fire, ascertain the number of deaths, organize 
salvage operations, and deal with the aftermath of the fire. 
The Zhejiang Province officials put together a top team to 
direct the rescue effort and begin investigations at the scene, 
search for bodies, and provide every possible convenience for 
relatives of the victims. Concerned mainland departments are 
continuing their work to settle problems arising from the 
incident, and their work has won the understanding of relatives 
of the victims. Now, the bodies of victims have all gone 
through funeral rites and have been cremated and the ashes 
brought back to Taiwan by victims' relatives. 
  Concerned departments are investigating causes behind the 
Qiandao pleasure boat fire incident and will release the results 
as soon as possible. Concerned departments will learn from the 
experience of this extraordinarily serious incident, heighten 
safety awareness, tighten safety measures, plug all loopholes, 
take preventive measures, and create good tourist conditions and 
environment in order to better serve overseas and domestic 
tourists. 
  Taiwan people were grieved by the unfortunate incident 
befalling on the 24 Taiwan compatriots. Media on the island 
over the last few days have given extensive coverage to the 
responses by Taiwan society, the strong objections of the 
island's ruling force, and speculations on the causes of the 
incident. Many Taiwan newspapers ran dispatches sent by 
reporters from the scene of the incident. I think Taiwan's 
enormous reaction to the serious incident was perfectly 
understandable. Human lives are a serious matter; and mainland 
tourist, transport, public security departments should listen 
seriously to criticisms and views and meet the reasonable 
demands of victims's relatives in order to ease their minds. 
  The Qiandao pleasure boat fire was a tourist accident of 
rarely seen seriousness and complication. This is precisely the 
reason we should remain objective and calm in our approach and 
should not be emotional, much less politicize the incident and 
make moves detrimental to cross-strait relations. Recent 
speeches and actions by some leaders of Taiwan have caused 
concern among people on the island. A Taiwanese writer pointed 
out in a newspaper article that tourist accidents are social, 
not political matters. If both officials and society wanted to 
cut down cross-strait mutual help because of the incident, it 
would be like refraining from eating for fear of choking and 
would revert the situation to before the "lifting of martial 
law." Tourist accidents can happen at Qiandao Lake as easily as 
anywhere else. 
  A high-level Taiwan "economic ministry" official asked 
Taiwan 
businessmen to temporarily suspend mainland investment in the 
aftermath of Qiandao incident. The demand was opposed by 
high-level personnel with the "Society for Taiwan Economic 
Building," who believed Qiandao to be an "isolated incident," 
and cross-strait economic ties and trade are the trend of the 
times. He also said that it was too early to make the 
conclusion that the Qiandao incident would affect cross-strait 
economic ties and trade. The trend shows that cross-strait 
economic ties and trade should continue to develop on the basis 
of mutual benefits, and authorities can only play a facilitating 
role. 
  I believe that the views of the above-mentioned two Taiwan 
personnel are quite perceptive and wise observations on the 
Qiandao incident. 
  My wish is to see concerted efforts from both shores to 
increase mutual trust, so that the shadow cast by the 
unfortunate Qiandao incident on cross-strait relations will 
disappear, the benevolent dynamic between the two shores can be 
maintained, and cross-strait relations can continue to develop. 
Bao Xin 11 April

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS)--Director-General of the 
Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] Mr. Chen Guangyi, 
speaking at a national civil aviation security meeting here 
today, said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities would 
coordinate with the Mainland in cracking down on airline 
hijacking. 
  Airline hijacking, Mr. Chen said, was a commonly recognized 
serious crime. CAAC had adopted a series of security measures 
to prevent airline hijacking in the past two years. It required 
the Taiwan authorities to repatriate Mainland hijackers in line 
with the "Quemoy Agreement" signed in September, 1990. The 
Taiwan authorities, however, practised a policy of separating 
hijackers from the airlines and refused to repatriate them 
immediately, resulting in hijackers feeling confident of 
escaping punishment and was in fact a form of connivance with 
the hijackers. 
  Mr. Chen said that in view of the responsibility for the 
safety of life and property of passengers including Taiwan 
compatriots and the desire to promote personnel and economic 
exchange between the two sides of the strait, the Mainland 
sincerely hoped that the Taiwan authorities would positively 
coordinate with the Mainland in jointly cracking down on plane 
hijacking and that the Mainland-based ARATS and Taiwan-based SEF 
would reach an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers as 
soon as possible. 
  Mr. Chen also said that the Mainland had noted the promise 
made by the Taiwan authorities that they would not grant 
political asylum to hijackers and would punish them severely. 
It also noted the consensus achieved by ARATS and SEF on the 
repatriation of all hijackers in principle and reached a basic 
framework for the agreement regarding such repatriation. The 
Mainland thanked figures from various sectors in Taiwan for 
their support for repatriation of hijackers as soon as possible. 
Mr. Chen said he believed that so long as the two sides 
cooperated and made joint efforts to seriously crack down on the 
crime of hijacking and made immediate repatriation of hijackers, 
such crime would be halted and the safety of passengers and 
property guaranteed.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The Seventh Security Police Group under the 
National Political Administration has completed its first patrol 
mission in the South China Sea. Minister of the Interior Wu 
Po-hsiung said: We will carry out such missions irregularly in 
the future, which is of great significance for claiming our 
sovereignty in the South China Sea. This will also focus 
international attention on the fact of our presence in the 
Nansha Islands [Spratlys]. 
  Two 400-ton patrol boats of the Seventh Security Police 
Group 
have completed their first 12-day patrol mission in the South 
China Sea. This is the first time that our country has 
exercised its police power in the South China Sea. 
  Minister Wu Po-hsiung said: The construction of satellite 
communication facilities on Taiping Island will soon be 
completed. With that island as a base, we will serve various 
countries with weather reports. We will build wharves there. 
But for the time being, we have no plans to build an airport 
there. 
  Minister Wu Po-hsiung said: What is most important is that 
we want the international community to know the fact of our 
presence in the Nansha Islands. Having legally occupied Taiping 
Island for a long time, we have a legal claim on its territory. 
  The two patrol boats were commanded by Chang Chen-chung of 
the Seventh Security Police Group. He said: During the patrol, 
his boats did not clash with any vessels of the Chinese 
communist Navy or the Vietnamese Navy, but discovered that 
Vietnam was building in a way on [name of island indistinct), 
one of the Nansha Islands. This shows that Vietnam attaches 
increasing importance to its right to exploit resources in the 
South China Sea. This cannot but cause our government to pay 
close attention to our rights there. 
  However, Wu Po-hsiung stressed: We do not want to cause any 
confrontation or tensions in the South China Sea, but hope to 
exploit various resources there along with other countries.

<F P=106> [Roundup by reporters Hsieh Lung-tien and Lin Hsin-hui] </F>
  [Text] Two 400-ton-class patrol boats of the Seventh 
Security Police Group set sail on 16 April for a patrol of the 
Spratly waters and a landing on Taiping Island there. This is 
the first time that our country has extended its police 
authority to the South China Sea to reassert our sovereignty 
over the South China Sea. The police patrol boats were to link 
up at Taiping Island with Yu-hsun No.2 boat and naval warships 
which went there by separate routes. Their operations have so 
far been kept secret. The patrol boats are on their way home 
and will arrive in Kaohsiung today or tomorrow. 
  According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its No. 2 
and 
No. 3 patrol boats, led by Chang Chen-chung, chief secretary of 
the police group, set out from the No. 2 harbor at Kaohsiung at 
1930 on 16 April with a dozen or so high-ranking police officers 
on board, including Hou Chin-tsung, commander of the second 
battalion of the Seventh Security Police Group. Besides a dozen 
or so crew members, each boat also has on board more than a 
dozen policemen from the Fourth Company of the Seventh Security 
Police Group, armed with machineguns and Uzi submachineguns. 
  According to the Seventh Security Police Group, our fishing 
boats have frequently been detained by the Philippines and 
Vietnam and piracy has been a serious threat to the lives and 
property of our fishermen operating in the South China Sea in 
recent years. Our country's South China Sea policy clearly 
calls for strengthened police patrols to protect our fishermen. 
For this reason, our first police patrol there serves to signal 
to the international community our reassertion of sovereignty 
over the South China Sea. Since the high level [of government] 
attaches considerable importance to this police patrol, it has 
been carried out after six months of prudent planning. 
  According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its patrol 
boats are performing duties around Taiping Island for the first 
time. The main purpose is to test navigational safety between 
Taiwan and Taiping Island and to survey the waters around the 
island to prepare for stationing a police company on the island 
in the future. 
  According to the Seventh Security Police Group, the No. 2 
and 
No. 3 patrol boats are on their way home, expected to arrive in 
Kaohsiung harbor today or tomorrow. Its Fourth Company, 
stationed in Kaohsiung, has four patrol boats -- the 
800-ton-class No. 1 boat, the 400-ton-class No. 2 and No. 3 
boats, and the 200-ton-class No. 5 boat. Some of the boats may 
be diverted to perform duties around Taiping Island in the 
future.

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- A special China Airlines 
[CAL] flight on Saturday [30 April] carried back to Taiwan the 
remains of the 101 Taiwan victims of the CAL Airbus-300 crash in 
Nagoya, Japan. 
  A mixed Buddhist and Taoist ceremony to appease the spirits 
of the victims was held at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport 
upon the arrival of their bodies. 
  Transportation and Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun, 
Civil Aeronautics Administration Director-General Sun 
Chao-liang, Association of East Asian Relations Chairman Ma 
Chih-chuang, CAL General Manager Yuan Hsing-yuan, and Foreign 
Ministry officials were present at the ceremony. They bowed 
three times in front of the spirit tablets of the victims to pay 
homage. 
  CAL officials, led by Yuan, carried banners saying "CAL Asks 
For the Forgiveness of the Victims," and "All CAL Staff Mourn 
the Death of the Victims." 
  The CAL Airbus-300 crashed upon landing and caught fire at 
the Nagoya airport in central Japan on Tuesday, killing 263 out 
of the 271 passengers and crewmembers aboard in what was the 
10th worst accident in world aviation history. Of the eight 
survivors, two were Taiwanese. 
  Most of the bodies of the Taiwan victims, who were mostly 
from southern Taiwan, were cremated in Nagoya. 
  After the ceremony, the remains and bodies of the southern 
Taiwan victims were ferried from Chiang Kai-shek airport to 
Kaohsiung by another CAL flight.

  [Text] Taipei, April 28 KYODO--Taiwan's Transportation and 
Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun on Thursday [28 April] 
said that the government will instruct China Airlines to 
sufficiently improve its safety measures in the wake of its 
jetliner crash at Nagoya airport in central Japan, which killed 
263 people. 
  Liu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said if the national 
flag 
carrier fails to implement the instruction demand within a 
specific period, the government may suspend some of its routes. 
  Li also said the government will take some disciplinary 
measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday 
crash. 
  Earlier in the day, President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a 
meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist 
Party (Kuomintang) that a special committee has been set up 
within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to 
supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines 
in the aftermath of the crash. 
  All but eight of the aircraft's 271 passengers and crew, 
mostly Japanese and Taiwanese, were killed in the crash of the 
Airbus A300- 600R, arriving in Nagoya from Taipei. Two of the 
survivors are Taiwanese. 
  It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 
11th 
since 1969, giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of 
crashes per flight hours than the world average. 
  Many of the crashes, in which a total of 410 people have 
died, involved human error.

  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--A 10-member Republic of 
China [ROC] delegation, led by Vice Finance Minister Li 
Chung-ying, is leaving for France Friday [29 April] to attend 
the 27th Asian Development Bank (ADB) annual meeting. 
  Some 54 ADB member countries are expected to attend the May 
3-5 meeting in Nice. An annual report will be released at the 
meeting and participants will discuss economic prospects in 
Asia, common problems Asian countries are facing, and problems 
funding infrastructure development in Southeast Asia. 
  During the meeting, Li will report on Taiwan's overseas 
investment and economic development as well as express the 
island's strong desire to join the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade (GATT). 
  Li said before departure that delegation members will also 
explain Taiwan's "southern strategy," which encourages 
investment in Southeast Asia, as well as Taiwan's financial 
situation. 
  In addition, Taiwan delegation members will attend a meeting 
of the procedures committee. This will be the first time since 
1970 that the ROC, a founding member of the ADB, has been 
allowed into the 12-member committee. 
  During the meeting, Li will protest the ADB's unilateral 
decision to change the ROC's designation at the international 
banking institute to "Taipei, China." 
  The ADB changed the ROC's representative name after Beijing 
joined the group in 1986. Taipei refused to take part in any 
ADB activities in protest of the unfair treatment in 1986 and 
1987. Participation resumed in 1988. 
  The delegation is scheduled to return to Taipei May 8.

  [Text] Taipei, April 27 (CNA) -- Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will represent Taiwan at the fifth 
working party meeting on Taiwan's accession to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) scheduled for May 17-19 in 
Geneva. 
  Sheu said Wednesday [27 April] that he will travel to Geneva 
from Washington, D.C., where he will meet with US officials on 
tariff issues May 9-10. 
  During the forthcoming GATT working party meeting, he noted, 
he will also hold bilateral consultations with Canada, Mexico, 
and the European Union. 
  The fifth working party meeting will be the first such 
meeting this year. The fourth meeting was held last October. 
  So far, 21 countries have asked for bilateral tariff 
negotiations with Taiwan, of which 14 have made tariff reduction 
requests, he said. Japan and the European Union, two of 
Taiwan's major trading partners, have not yet submitted their 
reduction requests, he added. 
  Taiwan has held tariff reduction talks with the United 
States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South Africa, and 
Hungary. 
  Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu of the Board of Foreign 
Trade (BOFT) is currently heading a delegation to the 
Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand for similar talks, while 
BOFT Director- General Huang Yen-chao is now in Tokyo for 
informal tariff talks with Japanese officials. 
  Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are 
expected to help ensure Taiwan's smooth entry into the 
Geneva-based world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan, which was accepted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] A mainland Chinese hijacker Thursday [28 April] was 
sentenced to 12 years in prison. (Hsu Ta-chun), 23, received 
the sentence after being convicted of air piracy. He was a 
salesman of the mainland's state-run China National Light 
Industrial Products Import and Export Corporation in the 
northeastern Chinese city of Harbin. 
  Hsu used a fake bomb to hijack a Xiamen Airlines Boeing 737 
to Taiwan on 12 December last year and asked for political 
asylum. None of the 92 passengers and crew on board were hurt. 
  Hsu is among 12 asylum seekers who have hijacked 11 mainland 
airliners to Taiwan since last April. Ten have been sentenced 
to up to 30 years in jail while the rest are waiting trial. 
  Taipei has so far rejected Peking's demand that hijackers be 
repatriated for trial on the mainland, citing judicial 
sovereignty over the criminals. But Taipei, trying to deter 
further hijacks, said hijackers will be heavily punished and 
deported after serving their terms.

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Director-General Sun Chao- 
liang of the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) resigned 
Saturday [30 April] "to comply with legislators' demands" in the 
wake of Tuesday's China Airlines (CAL) crash in Nagoya, Japan 
which killed 263 of the 271 people aboard. 
  Sun made the announcement after a joint meeting of the 
Legislative Yuan's Transportation and Communications Committee 
and Ways and Means Committee resolved Friday that Sun should 
resign from his post to take political responsibility for the 
crash, the worst in CAL history and the 10th worst in the world. 
  Sun said he would be pleased to resign, but argued that he 
is 
in no way responsible for the crash. 
  Sun refused to admit negligence on his part and refuted 
legislators' charges that he has worked for increased profits 
for CAL, noting that the airline has paid higher interest rates 
for its aircraft since he assumed office 14 months ago. 
  Sun said that the CAA only plays a judicial role in airline 
safety and has no control over the competence of pilots. 
  "Regulating pilots is the responsibility of the airline 
companies," he said. 
  Minister of Transportation and Communications Liu 
Chao-shiuan 
did not comment on Sun's resignation, but will have to accept 
the resignation for it to become effective. 
  Meanwhile, compensation for the crash is turning out to be a 
thorny issue for CAL. 
  If human error caused the crash, as many experts speculate, 
families of the victims would be eligible for much larger sums 
of money from CAL, sources said. 
  Although initial reports have pointed at human error, the 
true cause of the crash will not be known for two to three 
months, after an international investigation team completes 
analysis of the aircraft's flight and voice recorders.

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Taiwan will seek to sign a 
multilateral government procurement agreement in line with the 
Uruguay Round codes of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) sometime next year, the Council for Economic 
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Saturday [30 April]. 
  But, the council noted, Taiwan hopes to follow the example 
set by Hong Kong and South Korea to postpone acting on the new 
government procurement agreement until 1996. 
  Previously, Taiwan rejected the agreement because of the 
great number of state organizations which would be affected. It 
now needs to sign the accord in order to facilitate its entry 
into GATT. 
  Taiwan was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
hopes to become a full member by the end of this year and before 
GATT is superseded by the World Trade Organization. 
  CEPD Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi said that the council will 
establish a task force to overhaul Taiwan's government 
procurement practices to come into line with the GATT 
requirements. 
  Dozens of rules and regulations concerning government 
procurement will be revised and updated, Hsueh said. In 
addition, he said, the base price for open tenders will be 
lowered and all the bidding procedures will be completely open 
and transparent. 
  When the domestic government procurement market begins to 
open, he noted, the government will seek to exclude the 
International Telecommunications Administration, Taiwan Power 
Company, Chinese Petroleum Corp., and China Steel Corp. from the 
agreement. 
  Abrupt market opening might trigger unfair competition and 
thus adversely affect these state-run companies in view of 
Taiwan's weak competitiveness in power, telecommunications, 
energy, and steel, he explained.

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Police arrested four 
suspected drug dealers and seized 2 kilograms of heroin during a 
raid on a house in Taichung, central Taiwan, late Friday [29 
April] night. 
  The four suspects were Lin Chen-hsiung, 49; his wife Lin 
Chang Shu-mei, 44; Shieh Yu-chi, 30; and Li Ming-wei, 42. 
  The suspects had collaborated with drug dealers in Hong Kong 
and Thailand to smuggle heroin into Taiwan many times during the 
past year, the Criminal Investigation Bureau said Saturday. 
  Bureau agents began to shadow Lin and his associates last 
May. The police found the ring was headed by a Hong Kong-based 
man, known only as "Simon." Lin was responsible for drug 
distribution in Taiwan, agents said. 
  The agents found that the heroin was smuggled into Taiwan 
inside opaque bottles of alcohol. The smugglers placed small 
amounts of heroin inside the bottles and carried only two 
bottles each time through customs without incident, the agents 
said. 
  The agents said they will continue their investigation into 
the case.

  [Text] Taipei, April 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan businessmen should 
cooperate with their Turkish partners to tap lucrative markets 
in Turkey and other central Asian states, according to the 
president of the Turkish International Cooperation Agency. 
  President Umut Arik is in Taiwan as the head of a Turkish 
trade mission. In a speech on Monday [25 April], he touted 
Turkey's potential for Taiwan businessmen seeking to expand to 
the Central Asian and Commonwealth of Independent States markets. 
  Arik's visit marks the opening of a series of business 
promotions, including speeches, trade workshops, and visits by 
Turkish business groups to Taiwan, a China External Trade 
Development Council (CETRA) official said. 
  The Turkish Entrepreneurial Association Musiad, which boasts 
17 affiliate organizations and more than 1,800 members, is 
scheduled to host a trade and investment workshop Thursday at 
CETRA headquarters, the official said. 
  The workshop aims to promote investment cooperation between 
Turkey and Taiwan and expand Turkish distribution networks which 
target the Asia-Pacific region, he added. 
  Despite an inflation rate of 71.7 percent last year, 
Turkey's 
economic development potential should not be ignored, the 
official said. 
  Turkey's foreign trade stood at U.S.$44.8 billion in 1993 
with industrial products dominating the imports and manufactured 
goods and textiles and garments forming the bulk of the exports. 
  Taiwan's imports from Turkey totaled about U.S.$220 million 
in 1992 with crude steel dominating the imports. The island's 
exports to Turkey, totaling U.S.$150 million in the same year, 
including mainly consumer's goods and electronic products, CETRA 
reported.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--The exodus of 
labor-intensive industries to Mainland China and Southeast Asia 
has taken its toll on Taiwan's export business, the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday [29 April]. 
  Exports grew a marginal 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 
this year, far lower than the originally targeted 4.6 percent 
growth. Outbound shipments in the first two weeks of April also 
dropped 8.1 percent as compared with the same period last year. 
  Responding to the lackluster trend, the CEPD said it has 
decided to lower the export growth target for this year to 5 
percent from the previously-set 7.2 percent. 
  K.C. Li, director of the CEPD's Economic Research 
Department, 
attributed the slow export growth to several factors: 
  -- The exodus of labor-intensive industries to Mainland 
China 
and Southeast Asian countries has curtailed Taiwan's exports of 
furniture, toys, textiles and footwear. 
  -- Growth in exports of high-technology or high value-added 
products is too slow to make up for decreases in labor-intensive 
exports. 
  -- Sales to the mainland have declined since Beijing 
implemented economic austerity programs in the second half of 
last year. Moreover, many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland 
have opted to purchase needed raw materials there instead of 
Taiwan to save transport costs. Growth in mainland-bound 
shipments slid from last year's 28 percent to only 9.5 percent 
in the first quarter of this year. 
  However, Li said further study is needed before concluding 
that Taiwan's export trade faces the threat of recession as a 
result of the exodus of labor-intensive industries. 
  Li pointed out that despite a slowdown in exports, other 
major economic indicators showed signs of improvement in the 
January-March period. For example, overall industrial 
production rose 5.9 percent from the year-earlier level. 
Textile production increased 5.93 percent, chemical output 
climbed 16.4 percent, petrochemical production advanced 8.25 
percent, electronics and computer output also registered gains. 
  Li said domestic demand accounted for 54 percent of total 
sales in the first quarter, while foreign demand made up 46 
percent. 
  As export orders received in the first quarter rose 5.39 
percent from the year-earlier level, Li said outbound shipments 
will gradually regain momentum in the coming months. 
  With domestic and foreign demand increasing and industrial 
output growing, Li said, the country will still be able to 
register at least 6 percent economic growth this year.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan's two-way trade 
totaled U.S.$40 billion in the first three months of this year, 
cp 3.3 percent from the same period of 1993, according to 
customs statistics released Saturday [26 April]. 
  Of the amount, exports accounted for U.S.$20.1 billion, up a 
marginal 0.4 percent from the year-earlier level, while imports 
rose 6.3 percent to U.S.$19.9 billion. 
  Taiwan's major trade partners for the period were Asia, 
North 
America, Europe, the Middle East, Oceania, Africa, South America 
and Central America in that order. 
  Compared with the first quarter of 1993, two-way trade with 
Asia rose 8 percent, while trade with North America and Europe 
edged up less than 1 percent. 
  Trade with Central America registered an impressive 50.8 
percent increase during the three-month period as compared with 
the year before. Taiwan exported U.S.$400 million worth of 
goods to Central American countries during the period, while 
imports totaled only U.S.$37 million. 
  The figures indicated that Central America is a promising 
market worth tapping by Taiwan manufacturers, trade officials 
said. 
  Two-way trade with South America rose 3 percent, while trade 
with the Middle East, Oceania and Africa fell 7 percent, 3 
percent and 18 percent respectively.

  [Text] Taipei, April 23 (CNA) -- Trade volume between 
Taiwan and Europe in the first quarter of the year rose just 0.2 
percent as a whole over the same period of last year, but trade 
with Eastern Europe posted big gains. 
  According to customs statistics, Taiwan exported U.S.$3.1 
billion worth of products to Europe in the first three months of 
the year, an 8 percent decrease over 1992, while European 
imports here grew by 9 percent to U.S.$3.6 billion. 
  Although quarterly Taiwan trade with Eastern Europe stood at 
only U.S.$180 million, the figure represents a 23 percent 
increase from the year-earlier level. Taiwan exports to all 
Eastern European countries except Yugoslavia posted considerable 
gains. 
  The bilateral trade increase of 170 percent with [word 
indistinct] was the biggest with any Eastern European country. 
Trade with the states of the former Soviet Union grew 90 
percent, and trade with both Albania and Romania increased 50 
percent. 
  However, the states of the former Soviet Union posted the 
biggest increase in importing Taiwan goods in the three-month 
period -- 120 percent. Albania, the Czech Republic, and 
Bulgaria also increased their imports from Taiwan by 100 
percent, 70 percent and 30 percent, respectively.

  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- Given that more and more 
local industries have moved production lines to Southeast Asia, 
the government has decided to strengthen its ties with civilian 
trade groups there in a bid to offer better protection for 
Taiwan investors in the region. 
  Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who just returned from 
Penang, Malaysia, where on Saturday [23 April] he attended the 
first meeting of the Council of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce 
in Asia, said his ministry will do its best to push for the 
signing of bilateral investment guarantee pacts and agreements 
to avoid double taxation with every Southeast Asian country. It 
will also seek to set up formal channels of dialogue and 
communication with governments there. 
  The Economics Ministry estimated that at least 3,200 
production lines of local manufacturers have been relocated in 
Southeast Asian countries. Two-way trade between Taiwan and 
those countries reached US$6.62 billion in the first quarter of 
the year, a 9.3 percent increase over the same period last year. 
  According to statistics released by the cabinet-level 
Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the number of ethnic 
Chinese in Southeast Asia has surpassed 30 million, which 
accounts for 86 percent of the total number of overseas Chinese. 
  In view of the huge number of ethnic Chinese in the region, 
Chiang urged both state and Koumintang run enterprises to invest 
in Southeast Asia to match the government's "southern strategy," 
which encourages local business people to invest in Southeast 
Asia rather than in Mainland China. 
  THE ECONOMIST, a British news magazine, recently reported 
that the economic strength of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia 
is of vital importance to the region. Ethnic Chinese in 
Malaysia only make up one third of the total population there, 
but they hold nearly 50 percent of listed stock shares. 
  Likewise, the Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for 
only 
3 percent of the total population, but owns 70 percent of all 
companies in the country. Except for the petroleum industry and 
state-owned corporations, ethnic Chinese control about 50 
percent of Indonesia's economy, the magazine said. 
  In Thailand, Chinese make up 12 percent of the population, 
but control as much as 90 percent of the entire country's 
capital. Fifty percent of Thailand's financial and banking 
institutions are also under control of ethnic Chinese. 
  Given the prevailing economic strength of ethnic Chinese in 
Southeast Asia, the government has begun paying attention to its 
relations with ethnic Chinese population there while trying to 
sell its "southern strategy." 
  In an effort to build warm relations between Taiwan 
investors 
and ethnic Chinese businessmen, Mainland Affairs Council 
Chairman Huang Kun-hui and his deputy, Kao Koong-lian, will soon 
visit countries in Southeast Asia to promote the southern policy. 
  By explaining the government's position and its strategies, 
Huang and Kao hope to start a formula under which Taiwan 
enterprises and ethnic Chinese communities in those countries 
can break into the mainland Chinese market hand in hand. 
  The Mainland Affairs Council and the Economics Ministry will 
also draw up new plans to jointly encourage more local 
investments in southeast Asia. 
  Chiang said the government's southern strategy was not 
designed to curb Taiwan investments in Mainland China, but is 
meant to offer an alternative for Taiwan industries keen to 
expand into overseas markets.

  [Text] Taipei, April 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan's efforts to 
promote industrial upgrading have paid off as heavy industry 
exports reached a record high in the first quarter, the Ministry 
of Economic Affairs reported Thursday [28 April]. 
  Ministry tallies show that Taiwan exported US$108.30 billion 
worth of heavy industry products in the first three months of 
1994, accounting for 53.8 percent of its aggregate exports, 
which totaled US$201.3 billion. 
  The ratio of heavy industry exports to Taiwan's total 
outbound shipments represented a 2.5 percent growth from the 
same period of last year, while total exports increased only 0.4 
percent, officials said.

  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA) -- In a bid to curb the 
snowballing trade deficit with Japan, Taiwan is planning to 
establish a holding firm to introduce key manufacturing 
technologies from Japan, Kao Ching-yuan, chairman of the Chinese 
National Federation of Industries, said Friday [29 April]. 
  Kao said he will invite the public and private sectors as 
well as Japanese firms to jointly invest in the holding company 
which will have a capital base of at least NT [New Taiwan] $10 
billion (US$378 million). 
  After its establishment, the holding company will seek to 
transfer from Japan the technologies used in manufacturing each 
product that Taiwan imports, since Japanese imports exceed US$30 
million yearly, he added. 
  Kao said that Economics Minister P.K. Chiang and several 
local business heavyweights, including Honorary Chairman Ku 
Chen-fu of the Chinese National Association of Industry and 
Commerce, have expressed their support for the proposed company. 
  Taiwan has been disappointed with the result of its efforts 
to trim the trade deficit with Japan, and the gap is, in fact, 
widening. The deficit totaled US$14.22 billion last year, and 
is expected to increase to US$15.5 billion this year. The 
first- quarter deficit was US$3.7 billion.

Singapore established formal diplomatic relations with Communist 
China in August 1990. During his tenure, Chen has worked to 
maintain substantive ties between the two countries, exhibited 
in the increase in private exchanges between the two sides and 
strengthened trade relations. Government officials from both

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francis Deron: "Statement </F>
by Taiwanese Foreign Minister--Taiwan Unruffled by French 
Reconciliation With Beijing"] 
  [Text] Taipei--One would have expected more bitterness from 
Taiwan following Paris' recent political turnabout with respect 
to China and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's trip to Beijing. 
After all, when General de Gaulle had the French Embassy in 
China transferred to the mainland in 1964, it was Taipei that 
severed relations. 
  How things change! While Taipei still claims, as does 
Beijing, that it is the "only legitimate government" of the 
whole Chinese territory, pragmatism prevails in the capital of 
the non-Communist island, whose government is urging France to 
remain "realistic." In essence, the Taiwanese regime wants to 
put an end to the Manichean tradition of many Western countries, 
which in their relations with the Chinese world tend to choose 
either for Taiwan or for mainland China . 
  Such is the underlying message of the statements to LE MONDE 
by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Frederick Chien, who appeared 
surprisingly serene following the first concerns after the 
normalization of Franco-Chinese relations. "The aim of the 
(French) prime minister's visit (to mainland China) was not to 
damage relations between France and Taiwan. Accordingly, I 
think that we shall maintain the same relationship as we did 
before Mr. Balladur's trip," he said. 
  However, Taiwanese feelings were hurt by two aspects of 
France's new policy. First, in its 12 January joint communique 
with Beijing, France acknowledged for the first time the PRC 
point of view that Taiwan "is an integral part of China." The 
joint communique of 1964 on the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Paris and Beijing had been more restrained, 
leaving Communist China free to interpret it the way it saw fit, 
but expressing no agreement on the part of France. Only in a 
recent text -- of a purely technical nature, since it referred 
to air connections between France and the two rival Chinese 
capitals -- has France acknowledged Beijing's position. 
<H5>  Intertwined </H5>
  "While there is only one China," Mr. Chien notes, "it is 
unfortunately divided into two political entities. The PRC 
rules over the whole mainland territory, and the Chinese 
Republic rules over Taiwan as well as the Quemoy, Pescadores, 
and Matzu islands. These are the jurisdictional boundaries of 
the two entities. We sincerely hope that France will be 
realistic enough to accept this fact: The PRC's claim of 
sovereignty (over Taiwan) is not based on today's de facto 
situation." Besides, he adds, this has been going on for 45 
years: "You may have a visa for mainland China, but you will 
not have any use for it here!" 
  Another cause for disappointment for the Taiwanese has been 
the return of the notion--expressed by, among others, [French] 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe before Mr. Balladur's visit to 
mainland China -- that the Taiwanese market (20 million people) 
is a tiny one compared to that of the mainland (1.15 billion 
people). "Look at per-capita income figures: $350 on the 
mainland, compared with $10,000 here. The PRC is not as large a 
market as Mr. Juppe seems to think it is." 
  Mr. Chien does not mention what many French businessmen and 
economic experts have been anticipating: Ultimately, unless 
tensions between Taiwan and the mainland become worse than what 
they currently are, Taiwanese entrepreneurs and financiers will 
play a key role in many industrialization projects on the 
mainland. They think that this at least is a trend that can no 
longer be ignored, since the two economies have become so 
intertwined that 30-year-old views of the two-headed Chinese 
world have become anachronistic. 
  This is a fact that should be taken into account during the 
upcoming visits to the two Chinas of [French] Foreign Trade and 
Industry Minister Gerard Longuet: One to Beijing, where he has 
promised to head an industrial mission, and one to Taipei, where 
he is to inaugurate a French industrial high-technology 
exhibition in July. Seeing how the Chinese police went about 
harassing people during Mr. Balladur's trip to the mainland, the 
true magnitude of the "Chinese challenge" is becoming apparent 
for French exports to both Chinas.

  [Text] Asuncion, April 28 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] and Paraguay Thursday [28 April] entered into an agreement 
eliminating the need for citizens in one country working in the 
other to pay income tax to both governments. 
  Augustin Liu, Taiwan's ambassador to Paraguay, and 
Paraguayan 
Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner inked the accord, 
which aims to promote reciprocal investments between the two 
countries. 
  Under the agreement, which will be effective for five years, 
nationals of each country working in the other country can still 
be taxed by both governments on income earned from interest, 
royalties, and property transactions. 
  This is the third such pact Taiwan has signed. It earlier 
entered into similar agreements with Singapore and South Africa. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Ramirez expressed the hope 
that Taiwan investors would make more investments in Paraguay, 
thereby introducing advanced technology into the South American 
country. 
  Ambassador Liu said the agreement will help boost investment 
ties between the two countries, which is the Taipei Government's 
established policy.

JLG Airport Committee will meet in a few weeks but the specific 
date has yet to be decided. 
  Guo said he was optimistic about future agreements on the 
airport issue although differences remain between the two sides. 
  The airport issue is quite complicated and covers a wide 
range of fields including investments, debts, land approval, 
management ordinance and other issues, which are interrelated, 
Guo noted.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 30 Apr (WEN WEI PO) -- Zhang Junsheng 
and Zhu Yucheng, two deputy directors of the XINHUA Hong Kong 
Branch, stressed today that the People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
is of good quality and well-discipined because it is the 
people's own army. Hong Kong people should not have any concern 
over the troops stationed in Hong Kong. 
  Zhang Junsheng said: "The PLA is the people's own army in 
our country and an important force for defending our nation. 
Thanks to a strong PLA, our country can be independent and 
enjoy a stable environment for economic construction. 
Therefore, we should more readily accept our PLA." A reporter 
mentioned that some PLA men had beaten civilians, and Zhang 
replied: "It is possible that one or two people in the armed 
forces violate discipline, and such things may happen in any 
country in the world. This afternoon, the leaders of the 
military unit also said that if such things happen, they will 
handle them seriously. I think that we should still set our 
eyes on the mainstream of the Army." 
  Zhu Yucheng said: "The troops to be stationed in Hong Kong 
in the future certainly should know more about Hong Kong, and 
the best troops should be selected for this mission. I hope 
that more activities like this will be organized. Hong Kong 
people should not be concerned over the PLA because they are the 
people's own troops and their quality and discipline are 
absolutely perfect."

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "BOC to Help Stabilize HK Market"] </F>
  [Text] When the Bank of China issues HK dollars next 
month, it will be looking more toward the region's stability 
than economic gain, according to a senior bank official. 
  The bank's power to stabilize the local financial market 
will 
be enhanced with the note-issuance, Wang Qiren, Chairman of BOC, 
said on Thursday [28 April]. 
  He said it will also increase Hong Kong's status as an 
international financial centre and ensure the region's smooth 
transition back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
  Note-issuing banks will not bring any economic benefits to 
BOC under the current system, he said. 
  BOC will issue HK dollars on Monday after 20 months of 
preparation. 
  For every HK$7.80 [Hong Kong dollars] issued, BOC must match 
that by depositing $1 into the Hong Kong government's exchange 
fund. 
  A total of HK$3 billion ($384.6 million) will be issued this 
year, representing about 4 percent of the total HK notes 
currently in circulation. 
  BOC will have to bear the cost of issuing notes and the risk 
in the fluctuation of foreign exchange. 
  Wang said his bank has played an active role in ensuring the 
smooth operation of Hong Kong's financial system in the past few 
years by cooperating with the region's government. 
  "Participation in the notes issuance means our social 
responsibility has been enhanced," Wang said. 
  He said his bank will continue to conduct its business 
strictly in accordance with Hong Kong's financial laws He said 
that the Bank of China's relationship with local counterparts 
will not be changed by the note issue. 
  Wang said his bank will continue to support Hong Kong and 
Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered Bank as the 
main note issuers. 
  BOC is willing to cooperate with the other two banks and all 
other associates to contribute to the financial stability and 
development of Hong Kong, he said. 
  It has gained a firm foothold in the region and the BOC 
Group 
in Hong Kong is its largest overseas operation, as well as the 
second- largest banking group in Hong Kong. 
  Wang said the group has been supplying high quality service 
for local residents and firms with an objective of "taking root 
in Hong Kong, rendering services in Hong Kong.' 
  By the end of last year, the group assets value mounted to 
HK$700 billion with a network of more than 350 subsidiaries 
throughout the island, Kowloon and the New Territories. 
  The group's savings and credits have risen by 30 and 46 
times 
respectively since 1978.

<F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Guo Lingchun (6753 3781 </F>
2504): "Follow the Historical Tides and the People's Will"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 29 Apr (XINHUA)--The administrative and 
economic subcommittees under the Preliminary Working Committee 
[PWC] for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR] 
Preparatory Committee are scheduled to meet in Hong Kong in 
early May. People in Hong Kong have increasingly attached great 
importance and attention to the PWC because the role it plays 
has a close bearing on the smooth transfer of power when China 
resumes exercising its sovereignty over Hong Kong, and also on 
how Hong Kong will carry out the policy of "one country, two 
systems" and enjoy a high degree of autonomy after 1997 on the 
basis of the Hong Kong Basic Law. People of all circles fully 
endorse the work the PWC has accomplished since it was 
established nine months ago. 
  An organization whose establishment was authorized by the 
state's highest power organs, and the members of which are 
representative personnel in Hong Kong and China, the authority 
of the PWC is unquestionable. At this stage when the British 
have demonstrated no sincerity for cooperation, the PWC has 
taken up the formidable task of taking part in drawing up the 
blueprint for the development of Hong Kong--the "Pearl of the 
Orient"--after 1997. 
  The various measures the PWC has taken following its 
establishment show that it is pragmatism it underscores. Ever 
since its establishment in July 1993, it immediately proceeded 
to draw up plans in five areas--administrative, economic, legal, 
cultural, and social and security. Later, its members travelled 
between Beijing and Hong Kong, meeting one or two times each 
month since the beginning of the year to discuss issues ranging 
from the convergence of Hong Kong's current political system and 
economic framework with the Basic Law, to issues about how to 
expedite communications and transportation services between 
Shenzhen and Hong Kong. 
  The PWC has been proceeding with its operations in an 
orderly 
and earnest manner: It has been "screening" one by one the 
hundreds of regulations and statutes currently in effect in Hong 
Kong, based on the principle that they should be converged with 
the Basic Law. It has also started examining certain major 
issues concerning the economy and people's livelihood, and it 
has placed on its agenda the ways and means of stabilizing the 
ranks of Hong Kong's civil servants. Some people have said that 
while this important consultative organ has Hong Kong's future 
in its view, it also has taken Hong Kong's situation into 
consideration; and that while what it ponders upon and plans are 
major and imminent issues relevant to Hong Kong's final 
transitional period, all the issues are associated with Hong 
Kong residents' vital interests. Hong Kong's media can see from 
the region that the PWC's work is an "indication that Hong 
Kong's political development has henceforth stepped into a new 
era." 
  To build a new "kitchen" according to the Basic Law, PWC 
members who have accepted this great trust have pooled the 
wisdom of even more people in Hong Kong while releasing their 
own energy. As a result of their lobbying efforts in Hong Kong, 
many legal experts have taken part in consultations, and the 
discussion of revising textbooks has started within educational 
circles. While the PWC has reflected the wishes of more Hong 
Kong people through rallying the strength of various quarters, 
the efforts the PWC has made have also proved its representative 
nature and credibility. 
  This new-born organ is now taking root among the public. 
Since the end of last year, the PWC Secretariat, which is 
located in Peddar Street on Hong Kong island, has sent 280 
letters to various social groups to solicit their views on its 
subcommittees' planning. Thus far, over 60 groups have replied 
to express their views, over 60 people of various circles have 
expressed their views through telephone calls, and 123 people 
have expressed their support for the work done by the PWC and 
hailed PWC members for having "stepped forward for Hong Kong's 
smooth transition in 1997." A retired principal has sent 12 
letters consecutively to state his views, and a friend from 
cultural circles visited the PWC, offering to do "something 
concrete and practical" for the PWC. Over 10 groups, including 
different political organizations and nongovernment 
institutions, have also directly stated their views while 
meeting with the PWC's Hong Kong members. What they think and 
worry about coincide with the PWC's on-going projects, namely 
the convergence of laws, issues about the right of abode, as 
well as exit and entry after 1997, education on state and 
national concepts, and change of housing policies--issues 
ranging from macroscopic understanding to suggestions on 
minuscule matters -- and they have also urged people to watch 
out for the "moves" of the British side during the remaining few 
years. 
  Although the PWC's history has been short, its role cannot 
be 
underestimated. More and more countrymen in Hong Kong have 
expressed confidence in it and placed great trust in it. 
Shouldering the expectations of the people in the country, 
including the people in Hong Kong, the PWC has been carrying on 
with its glorious mission through soliciting constructive 
proposals, working earnestly, and following the historical tides 
and the will of the people.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Political Editor Mary Binks] </F>
  [Text] When China's most senior official in charge of Hong 
Kong affairs, Lu Ping arrives in the territory this afternoon it 
won't be to the fanfare of a people straining to return to the 
fold of the mother country. Rather, the reception of Mr Lu may 
well be akin to the Zen concept of "the sound of one hand 
clapping". The wish to applaud the visit will be tempered by 
the uncertainties of the transition of rule and the realisation 
that the bitterness which has fuelled those uncertainties is as 
entrenched as ever. 
  Mr Lu's refusal to meet Governor Chris Patten is one of the 
clearest signs yet that the fallout over political reform is 
hindering cooperation on other transitional issues as much as it 
ever did. Until now, both sides have at least attempted to 
bridge the gulf with rhetoric. 
  China believes that Mr Patten breached key understandings 
between the two countries by unilaterally embarking on 
constitutional reform. But Mr Patten hasn't acted alone. And 
what China doesn't seem to realise is that by attempting to 
isolate the Governor it risks isolating the people of Hong Kong 
by exacerbating their uncertainties and alienating their 
sympathies. 
  As much as China may want to, it will be impossible to 
undermine Chris Patten's influence on Hong Kong matters in the 
run up to 1997. Rather, in this case in particular, the Chinese 
leadership has allowed Mr Patten to launch a counter-offensive 
against Mr Lu's rejection of his invitation. The Governor has 
scored some points in suggesting that the Chinese side has not 
been prepared to put aside injured national pride for the sake 
of discussing the concerns of Hong Kong people in the transition 
period. 
  The civil service is jittery over whether there'll be 
sufficient seats on the through-train straddling 1997. There is 
no through- train for the three tiers of government, and China's 
economic problems coupled with its crackdown on dissidents has 
caused widespread unease. 
  Mr Lu will, of course, have extensive and thorough 
discussions with China's 200 or so advisers in Hong Kong, 
community think-tanks and business leaders over the course of 
this week. But the advice he receives may not differ much from 
that which has been channelled through the regular Hong 
Kong-China conduits of the National People's Congress and the 
Beijing-appointed Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). 
  The meetings of the PWC--for the first time in the territory 
this week--will no doubt show the people of Hong Kong that 
Beijing is perfectly capable of looking after their interests 
despite its strained relations with Britain. That may be cold 
comfort for the majority of people who are not deluded into 
thinking that China indulges in grassroots decision-making. The 
PWC isn't seen as a power broker in Beijing and the plethora of 
Hong Kong advisers has little more influence. The real 
decisions are made within the upper echelons of the Chinese 
leadership. Everyone knows that. 
  What the Hong Kong people want to see is some semblance of 
cooperation between the two sovereign states as the only sure 
way to minimise uncertainty and instability in the run up to 
1997. How much clout did Mr Lu have in deciding whether to 
accept the Governor's invitation to meet anyway? Surely a 
decision to meet would not depend entirely on Mr Lu but on the 
approval of more senior Chinese leaders.

  [Text] As the war of words between Hong Kong and Beijing 
took another turn, the Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday 
shrugged off the snub by Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, who said he would not meet him during a 
trip to Hong Kong next week. "I've got a busy programme next 
week as some of you may know so I don't feel particularly 
neglected," Patten said. But he added: "Even though I'll have a 
busy schedule next week, as he does, I'll be prepared...to 
change the schedule at any time if it was convenient to director 
Lu Ping." 
  According to an opinion poll conducted for EASTERN EXPRESS, 
more than 70 percent of respondents think Lu should meet the 
Governor. "I think the people of Hong Kong want to see us 
cooperating. I think they want to see us getting on with 
planning for the future. I think they want to see us working in 
the interest of the livelihood of the whole community," Patten 
said. "But, I've expressed my point of view, and I am sorry 
that director Lu Ping's schedule is so busy." 
  He said it was the Hong Kong government and the Executive 
Council that invited the Bank of China to become a note-issuing 
bank. He said it illustrated the extremely good financial 
cooperation between Hong Kong and China, which was an important 
part of the transitional process. Patten said that, although he 
was not invited to meet Lu, he hoped those who went to the 
"important ceremony" celebrating the issue of new notes would 
have a "smashing time". He denied a report by a British 
newspaper that his heart was in the United Kingdom and he was 
hoping to go back to the UK as soon as possible, saying he went 
to London as frequently as his predecessor. 
  Zhang Jun-sheng, the deputy director of the local New China 
News Agency (XINHUA) said Lu's refusal to meet the Governor did 
not violate the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). "The MOU 
said the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
should meet the Governor, but it did not say when. When there 
is a meeting between the two, there should be something to tall 
about," said Zhang. 
  Tsang Yok-sing, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for 
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), was disappointed by Lu's refusal 
to meet Patten. "We hope Lu and Patten can meet as soon as 
possible. Of course, we do not think one meeting can resolve all 
the issues. But still we believe meeting with Lu and Patten will 
be helpful," Tsang said. "We have been all along proposing to 
both governments that normal and regular meetings between Lu an 
Patten would be necessary an important for Hong Kong' smooth 
transition." 
  DAB's vice-chairman, Tar Yiu-chung, believed that the excuse 
of "having a busy schedule" was "superficial".

<F P=106> [By Jonathan Hill and Shiny Li] </F>
  [Excerpt] Governor Chris Patten has thrown a veiled insult 
at senior Beijing official Lu Ping, warning that any deliberate 
attempt to avoid him during a visit to Hong Kong would be 
perceived to be "small-minded". Mr Patten played down the 
apparent snubs by Mr Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, and the Bank of China yesterday, saying he did 
not feel "particularly neglected". 
  Mr Lu, who arrives in the territory tomorrow, has rejected 
an 
invitation to meet Mr Patten to discuss transitional issues. 
The Governor has also been left off the guest list of a Bank of 
China ceremony on Monday to celebrate the issuing of Hong Kong 
banknotes. 
  In an interview with the Sing Tao Group, Mr Patten said he 
regretted Mr Lu's refusal to meet him. "If it was deliberate, 
which I can't believe, I think it would seem to people to be 
rather small-minded, so I can't believe that it is meant in that 
way," Mr Patten said. "If he phoned up this afternoon we could 
clear the diary." 
  Mr Patten said he wanted to discuss the government's 
measures 
for tackling property speculation with Mr Lu because the issue 
straddled 1997. "It's partly because there are longer term 
implications that I was very keen to discuss the issue very 
candidly with Mr Lu," he said. "I think the people of Hong Kong 
want to see us cooperating." 
  Mr Patten earlier responded to the Bank of China's snub, 
saying he hoped everyone who had been invited to the ceremony 
had a "smashing time". It was the second time the Governor was 
snubbed by Chinese officials in 24 hours. Nevertheless, Mr 
Patten continued to garner political points in suggesting that 
Mr Lu was too busy to discuss the livelihood issues affecting 
Hong Kong people in the transitional period. 
  Banking officials said earlier that Mr Patten was not on the 
guest list for the ceremony because it was a financial matter 
and therefore not appropriate to invite him. The Governor 
stressed that financial officials from the Hong Kong government, 
including the Director of the Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, 
would be free to attend if they wished. Financial Secretary Sir 
Hamish Macleod embarks on a trip to Britain today and will not 
attend. A number of Hong Kong officials had extremely good 
working relationships with the financial -- authorities in China 
and it "would be a shame if they weren't able to go to what is 
an important ceremony," Mr Patten said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Governor, Chris Patten, made a last-ditch 
attempt yesterday to secure a meeting with visiting Hong Kong 
affairs chief Lu Ping, as Beijing announced that high-level 
talks on airport funding would begin within weeks. Mr Patten 
said he was prepared to receive Mr Lu--who arrives in Hong Kong 
tonight--in his capacity as a representative of the Preliminary 
Working Committee (PWC), despite a government ban on official 
contacts with the Beijing- appointed body. "That would create 
no difficulties for me," Mr Patten said, in response to a 
question from the SUNDAY MORNING POST. "It doesn't matter what 
hat he wears, whether it's head of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office or Secretary-General of the PWC, the important 
thing is there is a long agenda of issues and the people of Hong 
Kong expect us to get on and find solutions." 
  The comments came as the Chinese Joint Liaison Group team 
leader Guo Fengmin revealed that contacts were under way to fix 
a date for a meeting of the Airport Committee, which has not 
convened since August. Mr Guo was "optimistic" about making 
progress. "We are prepared to hold the Airport Committee 
meeting in a few weeks' time, but we have to discuss the exact 
date with the British," he said. "There is still a gap between 
the two sides but there has already been some progress." It 
will be the first opportunity for the committee to discuss the 
fresh financing package for the Chek Lap Kok project that the 
Government put forward in January. The Chinese side has raised 
no major objections to the plan. 
  Mr Patten's offer to meet Mr Lu was last night welcomed by 
advisers to Beijing, who warned that China could undermine its 
position by continuing to snub Mr Patten. But XINHUA (the NEW 
CHINA NEWS AGENCY) insisted a meeting between the two remained 
impossible. Until now, the Government has barred all official 
contacts with the PWC. Secretary for Economic Services Gordon 
Siu Kwing-chue was denied permission to brief a PWC economic 
sub-group. A government source insisted Mr Patten's remarks did 
not amount to a recognition that the PWC could replace existing 
diplomatic channels. 
  The Governor's offer comes after mainland officials said 
that 
since Mr Lu's nine-day visit was in the capacity of PWC 
Secretary- General, meeting the Governor would be inappropriate. 
"Mr Patten has tried his best to create a good environment for 
a meeting with Mr Lu and if Mr Lu still resists this, then it 
will undermine his image among Hong Kong people," leftist 
legislator Tam Yiu-chung said. "Even if he refuses to agree to 
a formal meeting, at least Mr Lu could meet and shake hands with 
Mr Patten at a public function." 
  In Guangzhou, newly-appointed Hong Kong Affairs adviser 
Anthony Cheung Bing-leung said the Governor's offer showed he 
was adopting a more pragmatic approach towards the PWC. But 
XINHUA Assistant Director Li Weiting said Mr Patten's remarks 
would make no difference: "I don't think this will help. Mr Lu 
is terribly busy this week and has to hurry back to Beijing to 
attend some meetings." In Hong Kong, XINHUA Deputy Director 
Zheng Guoxiong said it was more important for Mr Lu to spend his 
time meeting ordinary members of the community. "Mr Lu is 
visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of Secretary-General and 
Vice-Chairman of the PWC, to take part in meetings of the PWC's 
political and economic sub-groups," Mr Zheng said. "His 
schedule is really tight and he is unable to meet the Governor. 
He will use his very limited time to meet all sectors and 
groups in Hong Kong society.

<F P=106> [Report: "Lu Ping and Party Arrived in Hong Kong Last </F>
Evening; Zhou Nan Hosted Welcome Banquet"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, deputy chairman and secretary general of 
the Preparatory Working Committee, yesterday (1 May) came to 
Hong Kong from Guangzhou by through train along with mainland 
members of the Political and Economic Affairs Groups of the 
Preparatory Working Committee. He allowed Hong Kong and Macao 
reporters to take pictures of him on the platform at the Hungham 
Railway Station. Qin Wenjun, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong 
Kong Branch, met Lu Ping at the railway station 
  Lu Ping will preside over the seventh meeting of the 
Political Affairs Group of the Preparatory Working Committee 
today (2 May) and will attend the Bank of China's note-issuing 
inauguration cermony. 
  The Political Affairs Group of the Preparatory Working 
Committee will hold a two-day meeting in Hong Kong, its first 
meeting in Hong Kong. Tsang Yuk-sing, a member of the group, 
said that he had not received the official notice about the 
agenda of the meeting. According to the objectives already set 
by the group, the discussions on most issues had been completed, 
and only the issue of the transition of the consultative organs 
had yet to be discussed. The group will submit a report to the 
Preparatory Working Committee, and it is believed that the 
meeting will focus on these issues. 
  The Preparatory Working Committee will hold the meeting at 
the villa owned by XINHUA in Stanley. Tsang Yuk-sing said that, 
because Lu Ping would attend the banknote issuing ceremony at 
the Bank of China today, the Preparatory Working Committee 
meeting will begin at 1000. Yesterday evening, Zhou Nan, 
director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, held a banquet at the 
Stanley villa in honor of the mainland members of the Political 
and Economic Affairs Groups of the Preparatory Working 
Committee. Zhou Nan delivered a welcome speech, expressing his 
warm welcome to the mainland members of the Preparatory Working 
Committee, and wished the meeting great success. 
  Lu Ping, deputy chairman and secretary general of the 
Preparatory Working Committee, and Qin Wenjun and Chen Ziying, 
deputy secretaries general of the Preparatory Working Committee 
attended the banquet. The mainland members of the Political 
Affairs Group are Xiao Weiyun, Wang Fengchao, Shao Tianren, Zhao 
Jihua, Zhou Chengkui, and Chen Wei. The mainland members of 
the Economic Affairs Group are Gao Shangquan, Gan Ziyu, Wan 
Shaofen, Wang Qiren, Chen Yuan, Jing Shuping, Zhou Xiaochuan, Li 
Weiting, and Yu Xiaosong. 
  Zheng Guoxiong and Zhu Yucheng, deputy directors of the 
XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, and the responsible persons from the 
departments concerned of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch also 
attended the welcome banquet.

  [Text] China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs 
last night evaded a mass protest set up for his first visit to 
Hong Kong in two years. Lu Ping slipped by more than 100 
protesters and journalists waiting for him in the lobby of the 
Kowloon-Canton Railway station at Hunghom. 
  A coalition of about 120 groups charged Mr. Lu with being 
insincere in his claims of wanting to listen to Hong Kong 
people's views during his 10-day visit. They vowed to continue 
their protest in the coming few days until they successfully 
conveyed their discontent on the sentencing of Hong Kong 
reporter Xi Yang to Mr. Lu. 
  Following the unsuccessful attempt to meet Mr. Lu, about 10 
representatives from the Coalition for the Release of Xi Yang 
marched to the Bank of China Building in Central, where Mr. Lu 
is to attend the bank's note issuance ceremony today. They set 
up tents outside the bank and pledged to stay there all night. 
Pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching said Mr. Lu was acting 
like a mouse, being too afraid to face his critics. 
  "Didn't he say that he was coming to Hong Kong to meet the 
people of Hong Kong? What is the point of him escaping from us 
like that?" he said. Mr. Lu took the 4:13 pm train from 
Guangzhou yesterday afternoon, accompanied by officials from the 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, of which he is director, 
Chinese members of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) and 
about 200 members of China's National People's Congress, Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference, local PWC members 
and some of Beijing's Hong Kong Affairs Advisers. 
  They arrived at Hunghom at 6:50 pm and immediately walked 
from the Carriage No. 6 to a Mercedes-Benz limousine which had 
been driven into the cargo area near the platform. He and a 
band of security men boarded the limousine and left the station 
without seeing the protest in the arrival hall, one floor above. 
There was no official greeting from the Hong Kong Government. 
  A short press briefing scheduled after his arrival was 
cancelled because of the "large crowd" waiting at the station 
lobby. 
  Mr. Lu's refusal to meet the protesters follows his earlier 
rejection of talks with Governor Chris Patten, who had sought 
discussions on a wide range of unsettled matters relating to the 
handover in 1997. Before his arrival, Mr. Lu shrugged off an 
invitation from Mr. Patten to discuss the transition of the 
civil service and measures to curb the escalating property 
prices. 
  While turning Mr. Patten down, Mr. Lu has included in his 
tight schedule a meeting with at least five of the most 
influential civil servants associations next Saturday.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Rely on the Hong Kong Residents To Realize a </F>
Stable Transition"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, in his capacity of vice chairman and 
secretary general of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC], will 
come to Hong Kong to attend meetings of the political and 
economic ad hoc groups of the PWC and to solicit the Hong Kong 
people's opinions on affairs related to the late transitional 
period. During his stay here, Lu Ping will also meet with Hong 
Kong deputies to the people's congress, members of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] committee, 
representatives of grass-roots masses, and public figures from 
all walks of life. 
  Since Chris Patten has upset the process of convergence with 
the Basic Law and is unilaterally enforcing his constitutional 
reform program, China now harbors no illusions about him. The 
Chinese side is instead working in a down-to-earth manner to 
achieve a stable transition and is widely soliciting opinions 
among the Hong Kong people. A stable transition would be 
impossible in the late transitional period without Hong Kong 
people's participation, their ideas and wisdom, and their joint 
efforts as the masters of the city. Only by closely relying on 
the Hong Kong people, listening to their appeals, and getting 
familiar with the actual operation of this city, will the 
Chinese side be able to formulate a complete transition program 
which conforms with the Basic Law and suits both the historical 
conditions and present reality of Hong Kong. Although Lu Ping's 
stay in Hong Kong would only be a very short one, it is believed 
that he will try his best to meet as many Hong Kong people as 
possible and to listen to as many valuable views as possible 
from the Hong Kong people. 
  As for Chris Patten's expressed hope for a meeting with Lu 
Ping, because Lu's schedule will be tight this time, it is 
believed that this can be postponed to a later, more appropriate 
time. 
  China is relying on the Hong Kong people as the force 
supporting the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong and safeguarding the territory's prosperity and 
stability. No matter how Chris Patten is trying to undermine 
convergence in the constitutional system by playing the 
"international card" and attempting to drain Hong Kong of its 
economic resources, China has the confidence in and the ability 
to ensure a stable transition and the implementation of the 
principle of "one country, two systems" in Hong Kong, as long as 
it can enlist the Hong Kong people's support. Therefore, it is 
essential for the Chinese side to keep informed of local 
circumstances and public opinion in Hong Kong. 
  Chris Patten said he would roll out the red carpet for Lu 
Ping and that he is willing to meet with Lu Ping. This is 
nothing but another "political show" of a perfidious politician. 
Chris Patten does not have the slightest sincerity about 
keeping his promise. He ignored the agreements reached between 
China and Britain; when China and Britain were about to conclude 
a first-stage agreement on the constitutional matter, he 
insistently "derailed" the process; and he has time and again 
breached faith, undermined cooperation, and spoiled the 
atmosphere for meeting. Even if Lu Ping were to meet with him 
for one or two hours during his stay here, what would be the use? 
  Will Chris Patten assist China in ensuring a stable 
transition? No, he will not. Not long ago, the PWC expressed 
the hope of hearing the Hong Kong civil servants' opinions on a 
stable transition, and it was Chris Patten who deprived the 
civil servants of the opportunity to voice their opinions before 
the PWC. If we want to ensure the stable transfer of civil 
servants, then it is essential for us to hear their opinions. 
Chris Patten has not only tried to bar civil servants from 
voicing their opinions, but has also belittled the status of the 
PWC in every aspect through his henchmen mouthpieces. Now that 
Lu Ping, in the capacity of vice chairman and secretary general 
of the PWC, is coming to Hong Kong to solicit opinions, is Chris 
Patten going to change his attitude? If he does not change his 
attitude, then what is the use of a meeting? Let us take the 
implementation of the memorandum of understanding on the new 
airport project as an example. Up to now the issue has remained 
unsolved simply because Chris Patten has deliberately breached 
the commitment of not leaving a financial burden for the special 
administrative region [SAR] government and not letting the total 
amount of debt exceed 5 billion Hong Kong dollars. Furthermore, 
he has been trying to have his project approved on a piecemeal 
basis. As long as he does not change his stand, the obstacle to 
cooperation on the airport project issue will still be there. 
Negotiations between the two sides will produce a positive 
outcome only if he changes his stand. In citing the memorandum 
of understanding, this perfidious politician would only expose 
his hypocrisy and remind people of who has actually violated the 
agreement. There are many channels for consultation between the 
Chinese and British sides, including the joint liaison group, 
the expert groups, and contacts between the political adviser to 
the Hong Kong Government and the External Affairs Department of 
the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch. Chris Patten quite 
simply is not using these channels of communication and instead 
is insisting on holding talks with Lu Ping, despite the latter's 
tight schedule in Hong Kong. This clearly implies that he is 
"playing a trick." 
  In order to alleviate the pressure that he is facing in 
political circles at home, Chris Patten purposely granted an 
interview to the GUARDIAN in late April. He misinterpreted 
facts in an attempt to cheat the British electorate and mislead 
the public, saying that the Chinese side "has relaxed its 
stance" and some recent moves by the Chinese side have proven 
the correctness of his prediction. 
  To prove his talent for telling lies, he is now brazenly 
putting on a show and insisting on meeting with his counterpart. 
If his little trick had worked, of course he would loudly boast 
that his confrontation of the Chinese side has done no harm to 
Sino-British relations, and that China is dancing according to 
his "lead." If his trick were to fail, he would say that he 
does not mind losing face. 
  This is a common trick frequently played by charlatans. To 
deal with this kind of brazen ploy, the Chinese side of course 
needs to be somewhat serious. You want a meeting, well, there 
will be plenty of opportunities in the days to come. But, first 
of all, for your part, you must create a good atmosphere for a 
meeting, simply making empty talk through "megaphone diplomacy" 
does not work. As far as economic affairs and the people's 
livelihood are concerned, China will certainly take the Hong 
Kong people's interests into account. Evidence of this is the 
recent agreement on increasing land leases to keep down property 
prices. The consultations were conducted through the land 
committee, which is a good example of cooperation. Chris Patten, 
as the chief executive officer, should do a solid job and take 
measures to keep property prices down after land leases are 
increased. This is his duty. If he takes no action but is busy 
at home making visits with the aim of keeping abreast with the 
latest political developments in Britain and paving the way for 
his return to Westminster, then he will convince no one, even if 
he repeats ten thousand times his claim that he is working "for 
the Hong Kong people's interests." By asking to "discuss the 
property price issue with the Chinese side," the man seems to 
imply that the Chinese side must share the blame if the British 
side cannot solve the problem. Is this not too cunning a ploy?

<F P=106> [By political editor Chip Tsao and Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, yesterday flew in the face of public opinion by 
formally refusing to meet the Governor, Chris Patten, during his 
visit to the territory, which starts on Sunday. Lu's snub was 
delivered on the day that an opinion poll showed an overwhelming 
majority of the Hong Kong public want him to put aside his 
differences with Patten. 
  According to the poll, prepared by the public opinion survey 
centre of the Oriental Press Group, for Eastern Express and 
Oriental Daily News, 71 percent of those questioned think Lu 
should meet the Governor and 65 percent support Patten's written 
invitation to Lu to meet him. Another 74 percent said Lu should 
then invite the governor to visit Beijing to talk about Hong 
Kong issues. 
  This will be Lu's first visit to Hong Kong since Patten took 
office in 1992. They have only met once, shortly after the 
Governor had published his reform plans that angered China. 
  Patten said yesterday that he was disappointed by Lu's 
decision. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say that his 
schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't, on this 
occasion, be able to visit and to have a discussion though I 
think he suggested that there may be opportunities in the future 
which, indeed, I very much hope is the case," he said. "I am 
prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any hand, 
talk to anyone if it is in the interest of Hong Kong. I think 
that is what people in Hong Kong would expect. I think people in 
Hong Kong want us to talk together." 
  The Governor said that in his letter inviting Lu to a 
meeting, he suggested two topics for discussion. "The first is 
the whole question of property prices because I want to put him 
in the picture about how we saw the situation and what we 
thought was the right way forward in tackling it," he said. 
"The second issue which I said I would like to talk to him 
about was the transition of the civil service which is another 
issue which is important for us both." 
  The Governor's views are reflected in the poll, which shows 
more than half the people--53 percent--think the two should 
discuss political issues. Another 40 percent believe Hong Kong 
people's livelihood should be on the agenda. However, 46 
percent believe it would be unlikely that Hong Kong-Chinese 
relations could be improved even if there was such a meeting, 
while 38 percent were optimistic that a meeting between the 
governor and Lu would result in an improvement of relations. 
  The poll was conducted on Tuesday and yesterday, 
interviewing 
a representative cross-section of 260 people. 
  According to the 1991 Memorandum of Understanding signed by 
the British and Chinese foreign ministers, there should be 
regular meetings between the Governor and Lu to discuss Hong 
Kong affairs. The Governor said that if Lu's schedule was too 
busy to meet him, it must be too busy to meet any senior civil 
servants as well. 
  Mike Hanson, the senior government spokesman, said yesterday 
the poll was "revealing." "It shows that the people of Hong 
Kong want Lu Ping to meet the governor to discuss important 
issues that people are worried about. If such a meeting does 
not happen, it is for the Chinese to explain why," he said. 
  Li Weiting, an assistant to the director of the local New 
China News Agency (Xinhua), said since Hong Kong was a part of 
Chinese territory, the British administration here was nothing 
more than a "caretaker" and Xinhua was Hong Kong's "real 
master," it was natural that Lu would not meet the governor. 
  The United Democrats are writing a letter to Lu to request a 
meeting with him while he is in Hong Kong, to address their 
concerns, such as the case of Xi Yang, the Ming Pao reporter 
sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. 
  A pro-China legislator, Tam Yiu-chung, of the Democratic 
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), also said Lu 
should meet the Governor although the atmosphere was "not quite 
right" for such a meeting. "It will do Lu no good if he refuses 
to meet Patten. But it shows that China is still cross about 
Patten and Britain. We hope in future there will be such a 
chance," said Tam. 
  Hong Kong journalists also plan to lobby Lu to free Xi and 
petition him to relax the reporting restrictions in China. 
  Lu arrives in Hong Kong on Sunday from Guangzhou and will 
stay for about eight days. He will meet the Preliminary Working 
Committee members, Hong Kong affairs advisers, and delegates to 
the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference, all appointed by China.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Comment" page: "A Positive Message"] </F>
  [Text] Lu Ping's snubbing of the Governor of Hong Kong on 
his visit here next week sends a depressing message to the 
people of the territory. It seems to say that China has no 
interest in bridging the political divide. For the sake of an 
insult, China is prepared to risk damaging its own credibility 
as a calm and pragmatic sovereign power. 
  The snub is compounded by his decision to meet civil service 
associations, although at least this shows he is prepared to 
hear the views of those will be expected to make Hong Kong work 
after 1997. 
  The main purpose of the visit--attending the ceremony 
marking 
the Bank of China's debut as a note-issuing bank here--shows the 
Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office is also a man 
who cares about the territory's economic well-being. He is 
putting his anger at Britain's alleged perfidy aside and taking 
part in one of the most important gestures of confidence in the 
Sino-Hong Kong relationship either side has been prepared to 
make since the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on the 
Airport in July, 1991. 
  Whatever the tensions of the political relationship, the 
Bank 
of China's new role is more than just a symbol of the return to 
Chinese sovereignty. The bank has acquired the prestige of 
being one of the three institutions privileged to issue notes 
and has the prospect of becoming the main note-issuer in years 
to come. But it also has accepted responsibilities and 
obligations. It has taken on a commitment to helping maintain 
Hong Kong's economic equilibrium. 
  In an ironic twist not intended when Hong Kong agreed to the 
note-issuing function in 1991 (when the political through train 
was rocking dangerously but still on track) the bank's new role 
shows that the economic through-train is still firmly on the 
rails. 
  With the growing economic integration between Hong Kong and 
Southern China, and the large volumes of Hong Kong currency in 
circulation there, the Bank of China's higher profile in the 
territory is no more than a belated recognition of China's 
existing economic role here. 
<H5>  Reaffirm Commitment </H5>
  Mr Lu's decision to officiate at the note-issuing ceremony 
is 
an ideal opportunity for him to reaffirm China's commitment to 
making that integration work still more efficiently, for the 
benefit of both sides. 
  His visit, coupled with his less than diplomatic behaviour 
towards Mr Patten, is symbolic of China's much-vaunted 
determination to separate politics from economics. It is 
symbolic, too, of its commitment, three years before the change 
of sovereignty, to ensuring a smooth economic transition. 
  Symbols alone, however, are not enough. Despite the pious 
phrases from both sides about the need to knuckle down to 
business as if the political impasse did not exist, their 
inaction has often spoken louder than their words. 
  Hong Kong is still waiting, with a patience born of 
necessity, for agreement on the airport and rail link financing 
package. Yet almost three years have passed since the signature 
of the Airport MOU [Memorandum of Understanding], which was 
supposed to put an end to the squabbling. 
<H5>  Watching Helplessly </H5>
  Hong Kong is still hoping for a resolution of the row over 
Container Terminal 9, although the delay is already threatening 
to affect the territory's economic prospects. 
  Hong Kong is still watching helplessly while the stalling 
over international air service agreements erodes confidence in 
its future as an aviation hub and undermines the public's 
confidence in the viability of Chek Lap Kok. 
  Aside from the CT9 [Container Terminal 9] row, co-operation 
within the Sino-British Land Commission has been excellent. But 
in the Joint Liaison Group, where economic and political matters 
are intertwined, progress has been painfully slow. 
  It is the infrastructure row, however, that has been a 
particular hobby-horse of Mr Lu's ever since Sir David Wilson 
announced his Port and Airport Development Strategy [PADS] as a 
confidence-boosting measure in October, 1989. In Mr Lu's memory 
of the period, it was the announcement of PADS, without prior 
consultation with China, which marked a serious deterioration of 
the Sino-British relationship. Yet that misunderstanding was 
supposed to have been cleared up by the Airport MOU. 
  Mr Lu long ago recognised the value of Hong Kong's economic 
and infrastructural developments to China and to the expansion 
of its role as a gateway and service hub to the entire region. 
  It is time Mr Lu gave some new positive impetus to the 
economic development of the territory and the region it serves 
by overcoming the psychological hurdle the airport seems to 
represent for him and giving the go-ahead for these much needed 
projects. 
  Next week's note issuing ceremony would be the perfect 
occasion for such a bold new initiative. And that would be the 
most positive message he could give the people of Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Editorial: Lu Ping: Poor Start to Vital Visit] </F>
  [Text] So, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, you have finally got here. It has taken you a 
while, but let us hope the wait has been worth it. 
  It must be said that first impressions left a lot to be 
desired. You arrived at Hung Hom KCR station without saying a 
word, despite the fact that a senior member of your entourage 
said that the New China News Agency (Xinhua) was organising a 
press conference for you. Xinhua staff later denied knowing 
anything about a press conference. 
  This looks really bad. It gives the impression that either 
you, Xinhua, or perhaps both have very little idea about either 
the art of public relations, basic organisational skills or 
perhaps both. We would like to think that matters will improve 
on this front. 
  The less time you spend inside the luxury Xinhua villa in 
Stanley the better. 
  Many things have changed since your last visit in 1992, some 
that you know about, some you do not. So make the most of your 
visit. Make sure that by the time you leave you know what is 
going on in Hong Kong. In theory, that should not be difficult. 
  You can start by talking and listening to as many different 
people as possible, not just the fawning flunkies who will be 
crawling at your feet every step you take. 
  Relying on information from a bevy of pro-Beijing sycophants 
is both silly and dangerous. Silly because the majority of 
these people have not got the guts to tell you anything that you 
do not want to hear. Dangerous because it leaves you in the 
dark about what is really going on in Hong Kong and what most 
people here are thinking. 
  When you talk to people, speak in plain terms, not in 
diplo-babble. Let them know what is happening about the new 
airport, Container Terminal 9, and all the other big issues that 
need to be sorted out as soon as possible for the good of the 
territory. 
  The average person in Hong Kong wants reassuring that life 
will go on as normal for them and their children after 1997. 
They want to know what China is doing to guarantee the 
much-touted "stability and prosperity" of Hong Kong. They want 
to believe that China understands both how Hong Kong works and 
the people who live here. 
  There are many things people do not want to hear. They do 
not want to hear you attempt to score a series of political 
points against Governor Chris Patten or the British government. 
They certainly do not want to hear yet another round of 
bickering between you and the Governor. They do not want to 
know. They are bored with it. They have heard it all before. 
  They have already told you through an opinion poll conducted 
by this newspaper that your decision not to meet Patten was a 
bad one. Seven out of 10 people interviewed thought you should 
talk to him. 
  The exchange of unpleasantries that accompanied the snub was 
also unnecessary. You said you were too busy to meet him. He 
said: "I've got a busy programme...so I don't feel particularly 
neglected." What nonsense. How silly. 
  When you are listening, listen hard. Again, do not just 
listen to people who are going to tell you what you already 
know. Listen to people who may tell you things you do not want 
to hear (there are plenty of them). 
  One thing many people in Hong Kong have to say is: "If it 
ain't broke, don't fix it." In other words, the less 
interference, the less meddling, the better. 
  How times have changed since your last visit in 1992. Then, 
it was all sweetness and light -- well, almost. There were 
occasional spats about the airport (at least some things do not 
change) and changes to the committee structure of the 
Legislative Council, a subject that seemed controversial at the 
time. 
  That, of course, was before the arrival of that "Man of 
Guilt" Patten and his strange ideas about electoral reform. 
  In 1992, Lord Wilson (then just humble Sir David) said his 
regular meetings with you were a good idea as they gave both 
sides a chance to discuss matters of concern. It is just the 
sort of jolly sensible thing that a reserved and scholarly 
diplomat would say. And he was right, of course. 
  But Lord Wilson is history, as are many of the policies and 
attitudes associated with his governorship. Gone are the days 
when almost every legislative councillor accepted almost 
everything they were told by government. Gone too is a 
government that snaps to attention every time Beijing barks an 
order. 
  Instead, we have political parties that bicker and rant just 
like political parties do in other countries. We have 
legislators who make a nuisance of themselves by calling for 
inquiries and asking difficult questions. 
  All this may appear rather odd to you, even disturbing. It 
was always going to be easier to inherit a docile population 
accustomed to doing what it was told. 
  Please take careful note that this is not the case. Beijing 
should know this. Times have changed. Please change with them. 
  We hope you enjoy your stay and look forward to your next 
trip. Let us hope it is not another two years before you visit 
again. You cannot afford to wait that long. Nor can Hong Kong.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Joining Lu Ping this week will be two rising stars 
of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office: administration 
director Xu Ze and economic director Zhang Liangdong. 
  Relatively young in years--Mr Xu is 38 and Mr Zhang is 
40--both are potential successors to Mr Lu. Unlike their chief, 
however, both have previously done their best to keep a low 
profile. They seldom respond to questions from reporters at 
public functions and are therefore rarely sought for comment. 
However, January's high-level reshuffle at the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, which elevated both to their present 
posts, has thrown them into the spotlight. Mr Xu is now in 
charge of political affairs, which covers such crucial issues as 
the fate of the Legislative Council after 1997 and the future of 
the civil service, while Mr Zhang's economic remit includes 
responsibility for the Chek Lap Kok project. 
  Their appointments were out of character for the Chinese 
bureaucracy, which normally appoints elderly cadres to such key 
posts. They are also highly unusual in that, unlike most 
mainland officials handling Hong Kong affairs, both are from 
Guangdong province and speak fluent Cantonese. Mr Xu, who is 
said to be highly regarded by Mr Lu, made his mark during last 
year's Sino- British negotiations on political reform. Although 
he did not take part in the 17 rounds of unsuccessful talks, he 
is believed to have played a key role in formulating the Chinese 
team's counter-proposals on Hong Kong's 1994-95 polls. At the 
time Mr Xu was deputy director of the Hong Kong affairs office's 
First Department, later renamed the Administration Department. 
In this position, he met a wide range of delegations from the 
territory, and accompanied Mr Lu to meetings with them whenever 
political affairs were on the agenda. 
  The two rising stars were also classmates: they were part of 
the second batch of students to begin tertiary studies following 
the re-opening of mainland universities at the end of the 
Cultural Revolution. Admitted to the Chinese Language 
Department of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou in 1978, they 
joined the newly-formed Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
immediately after their graduation in 1982. Mr Zhang also did a 
stint as First Secretary at the Hong Kong office of the Chinese 
Joint Liaison Group team. He returned to Beijing in 1990 and 
later studied in Britain.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (AFP)--Beijing denounced Friday 
the meeting in Washington between President Bill Clinton and 
Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, as "severe 
interference" in China's internal affairs. 
  "The meeting ran counter to the position of recognising 
Tibet 
as a part of China's territory, which the United States has 
repeatedly asserted, and constitutes a severe interference in 
China's internal affairs," a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. 
According to the White House, Clinton joined a meeting Thursday 
between the Dalai Lama and Vice President Al Gore to discuss 
efforts to initiate a dialogue with the Chinese leadership on 
the future of Tibet. 
  The meeting had gone ahead "despite the repeated 
representations and opposition of the Chinese government," the 
spokesman said. 
  "We demand that the US side keep up its commitment to 
recognising Tibet as a part of China...and refrain from taking 
actions which may undermine Sino-US relations," he added. 
Chinese communist forces moved into Tibet in 1951 and took 
control of the Himalayan region. The United States has 
repeatedly cited the example of Tibet when criticising the human 
rights situation in China. 
  The spokesman also slammed the passage through the U.S. 
Congress of a foreign operations bill that grants 30 million 
dollars for the creation of a U.S. radio network to broadcast 
into China, including Tibet, and other Asian nations. The real 
motive behind the establishment of Radio Free Asia "is to make 
use of the media to interfere in the domestic affairs of China 
and other Asian countries," the spokesman said. "The move by 
the US Congress constitutes an encroachment upon the universally 
acknowledged basic norms governing international relations." 
  Together with progress in human rights, one of Clinton's 
preconditions for the renewal in June of China's preferential 
trading status is allow foreign radio broadcasts into the 
country. 
  China has repeatedly blocked Voice of America broadcasts in 
the past.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the "Opinion" page: "New Silk Road"] </F>
  [Text] Premier Li Peng has just concluded a trip of four 
Central Asian nations -- Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrzstan, 
Kazakhstan and Mongolia. 
  This is the first trip ever made by a top Chinese leader to 
these neighbouring nations. 
  Owing to the historical Silk Road, friendly relations have 
long existed between China and the Central Asian countries. 
  Mongolia and China have long enjoyed good relations. And 
after the establishment of diplomatic relations in the last few 
years, ties between China and the four Central Asian countries 
have been expanding rapidly. 
  The leaders of these five countries have all been to China 
in 
the last few years for visits which promoted mutual 
understanding and strengthened cooperation. 
  Premier Li's return visit to these five nations is not meant 
only as a friendly gesture. It represents China's genuine 
desire to further develop mutually beneficial relations with its 
neighbouring states. 
  In Tashkent, Uzbekistan's capital, Li made a candid, sincere 
and comprehensive policy statement on China's relations with the 
Central Asian countries. 
  And Li's speech was repeatedly punctuated by applause. The 
applause was especially strong when he said, "We cherish 
goodwill and friendly sentiment towards the people of Central 
Asian countries. We will always be your good friend and 
neighbour." 
  When Li arrived in Kyrgyzstan, on the third leg of his 
tour,President Askar Akayev said Li's warm words in Tashkent had 
in the space of a few days become household words in the Central 
Asian nations. 
  This shows that Li's statement reflected a common wish of 
all 
the people in the region and as a result his words touched their 
hearts. 
  China and its neighbours in the northwest are developing 
nations who need a peaceful and stable domestic and 
international environment to develop their economies. 
  And the friendship advocated by Li, constitutes the best 
guarantee for such an environment. 
  Trade and economic cooperation between China and its 
northwestern neighbours have made much progress in recent years. 
  However, there is still great potential for further 
development. Exchanges in the past have shown that the economies 
are complementary. And closer cooperation in economic matters 
will be to the advantage of all parties. 
  Li was accompanied on his tour by a group of Chinese 
entrepreneurs. 
  And on each leg of the premier's tour, these businessmen 
held 
talks with their counterparts and struck many deals. This was 
an effective way of speeding up economic cooperation. 
  Li also discussed other projects with his hosts. The 
building of the Turkmenistan-China-Japan gas pipeline is just 
one example. 
  Li's trip has deepened understanding and promoted goodwill 
with the five northwestern nations and has created conditions 
for further economic cooperation and cultural exchange. 
  And it is expected that the new Silk Road will bring greater 
prosperity China and our northwest neighbours in the future.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan should 
advance their long-term, stable and friendly cooperative 
relations, a senior Chinese official said here today. 
  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said China and 
Japan should draw lessons from history so as to maintain 
long-term friendly relations, which is important not only to the 
Asia-Pacific region but also to the rest of the world. 
  Qian made the remarks at a meeting with Bunbei Hara, 
president of the House of Councillors of the Japanese Diet, and 
a delegation he is leading. 
  China hopes to develop friendly relations with all 
countries, 
neighboring countries in particular, Qian said, adding that the 
development of Sino-Japanese relations is particularly necessary. 
  Hara said that he agreed with Qian. He said that Japan also 
needs a stable social and economic environment and should 
reflect on its history and make efforts together with China to 
develop bilateral relations. 
  At the meeting, Qian also touched on some international 
issues at the request of the delegation. Referring to the 
situation in the Korean peninsula, Qian reiterated China's 
consistent stand to solve problems on the peninsula through 
peaceful talks. On the issue of Cambodia, Qian said foreign 
powers should no longer interfere in the internal affairs of 
Cambodia, but let the Cambodian people headed by King Sihanouk 
solve the problems themselves.

  [Text] Cairo, May 1 (XINHUA) -- The last round of the 
PLO-Israeli peace talks resumed here today to put the finishing 
touches on the general agreement of the implementation of the 
Gaza-Jericho self-rule deal. 
  The Palestinian side is presided by Major General 
'Abd-al-Razek al-Yehya, for the chief PLO negotiator Nabil 
Shaath is in Tunisia now, and the Israeli side is headed by 
Major General Ammon Shahak, the Israeli deputy chief of staff. 
  Khaled al-Qudra, a member of the Palestinian negotiating 
delegation, said in a press release that the Palestinian and 
Israeli sides are about to finish the phraseology of the general 
agreement. 
  Some sources close to the talks said that the viewpoints of 
the two sides were brought closer and that agreement on the 
standing disputable issues are expected to be phrased out in 
paragraphs of the general agreement during this round. 
  As for the entry of the Palestinian police force into the 
Gaza Strip and Jericho, the Israelis consider accessing of 25 
elements of the Palestinian police vanguards on the day of 
initialling the agreement. A week later 1,000 to 1,500 
Palestinian policemen will be permitted entry. 
  The Palestinian side deems as necessary the deployment of 
all 
the Palestinian police force, not only 25 of them, during the 
first week after signing the agreement following the withdrawal 
of the Israeli Army, slated for the second day after initialling 
the agreement. 
  The sources said that 'Arafat and Rabin are due to discuss 
during their imminent meeting, slated for Tuesday [3 May] 
evening, two issues: the size of Jericho area and the 
Palestinian police presence at border crossings. 
  This round of talks is scheduled to last for three days and 
end on Tuesday evening, the night before signing the final 
agreement on Wednesday. 
  President Husni Mubarak of Egypt, the Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat, the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and the Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres held a conference 
on April 28 to probe ways of removing the standing obstacles 
before initialling the final PLO-Israeli agreement on 
implementing the Gaza-Jericho deal. 
  President Mubarak said after the conference that the 
Palestinian and the Israeli sides agreed on holding a meeting 
between the Palestinian President 'Arafat and the Israeli Prime 
Minister Rabin on May 3 and signing the final agreement the 
following day.

<F P=106> [From the "Current Affairs" program] </F>
  [Text] China has urged the U.S. Government to abide by the 
1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique on U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. 
At a weekly press conference on Thursday [28 April], Chinese 
Foreign Ministry's Wu Jianmin made the statement in response to 
the U.S. adoption of a new legislation. 
  The modified Murkowski Amendment was adopted ten days ago by 
the joint conference of the U.S. Senate and the House of 
Representatives. The document asserts that the Taiwan Relations 
Act takes primacy over the 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique in 
which the two governments pledged to resolve the issue of U.S. 
arms sales to Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin 
criticized the American legislation, saying its essence negates 
the bilateral communique. Wu Jianmin said the modified 
amendment not only undermines the relations between the two 
countries, but sets up obstacles to the reunification of China's 
Mainland and Taiwan. He urged the U.S. Government to abide by 
the guiding principle governing bilateral ties and take 
immediate measures to keep Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm. 
  On another issue concerning the U.S., spokesman Wu Jianmin 
expressed opposition to a reported meeting between President 
Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama. Wu Jianmin said Dalai is not 
only a religious leader, but a political exile. And for a long 
time, he has engaged in activities aiming to split China. 
Therefore, the spokesman concluded any official meeting with 
the Dalai Lama is an act of support for a separatist attempt and 
amounts to an interference in China's domestic affairs. 
  The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also dismissed the 
linkage between the MFN [most-favored nation] status and China's 
nuclear tests. Reports say some American legislators have 
warned that China's continued nuclear testing will do no good to 
the likelihood of the U.S. extending its tariff privileges. The 
spokesman said: among the world's five nuclear states, China has 
conducted the smallest number of nuclear tests, which account 
for only four percent of U.S. testing. 
  Finally, Wu Jianmin described the report that China has sent 
an additional 30,000 troops to Tibet and deployed them along the 
border with India as a sheer fabrication. Wu Jianmin said such 
a report has an ulterior motive. He said China and India signed 
an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility last 
year and have begun to negotiate on troop reduction along the 
line of actual control 
  For China Radio International, I am (Li Peiquan).

  [Text] Hohhot, 30 Apr (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li 
Pent attended celebrations of the 1 May International Labor Day 
in Hohhot, Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region this evening. 
  In the evening, the premier met with model workers from 
various fronts in Inner Mongolia and posed for a picture session 
with them. He extended Labor Day greetings to the working class 
and people in the autonomous region and throughout the country. 
  He said his visit to the four Central Asian nations and 
Mongolia was successful because it had expanded China's 
good-neighborly friendship with these countries and had 
accomplished the anticipated objective. Success in diplomatic 
work has been made possible through the remarkable achievements 
in reform, opening up, and modernization drive; while an 
independent and peaceful foreign policy has in turn provided a 
favorable external environment for domestic economic 
construction. 
  He said: In the past nearly 10 years, I have visited Inner 
Mongolia on three occasions and witnessed its great 
achievements. The autonomous region is rich in natural resources 
and enjoys unity of nationalities; therefore, it has great 
potential for growth. So long as the people of all 
nationalities in Inner Mongolia earnestly implement the party's 
line, principles and policies and work concertedly under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the core, Inner Mongolia will certainly score even 
greater achievements. 
  He pointed out: Model workers who are pace-setters in 
various fronts have made outstanding contributions to the 
socialist modernization drive. Guided by Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has 
implemented the policy of reform and opening up and promoted 
vigorous economic growth. Now is the time for large numbers of 
people to come forth and to develop their ability to the full. 
More advanced models will certainly emerge on all fronts. 
While promoting the building of material civilization, we 
should also attach great importance to spiritual civilization. 
It is hoped that model workers shall exemplify themselves in 
building not only material civilization but also spiritual 
civilization. They shall make still greater contributions to 
the motherland's prosperity. 
  At 2000 in the evening, Premier Li Peng, accompanied by 
regional party secretary Wang Qun and government chairman 
Wuliji, attended a soiree held by the autonomous region to 
celebrate the International Labor Day, and viewed a brilliant 
ethnic literary and artistic performance. At the end of 
performance, the premier ascended the stage, put on Mongolian 
costumes, and had pictures taken with performers. 
  Ismail Amat, Ye Qing, Yao Zhenyan, and Han Zhubin attended 
the soiree.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Li Lanqing urged foreign trade companies of the country to carry 
out bolder reforms during his visit of the ongoing 75th Chinese 
Export Commodity Fair here Friday [29 April] afternoon, on the 
eve of its close today. 
  The vice-premier visited the transaction halls and met with 
regional trade officials, in the company of Wu Yi, the minister 
of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and Zhu Senlin, the 
governor of Guangdong Province. 
  In his speech to the officials, Li congratulated the fair on 
its record transactions, saying that the introduction of a 
competitive mechanism is a major reason for its success. 
  Li affirmed that competitive bidding for export quotas is an 
effective solution to vicious and unfair competition between 
Chinese export companies. 
  Li said such a practice should be applied to more 
commodities 
than the present 13 sorts. 
  Li said he fully agrees with the plan that from the next 
session, commodities of the same sort will be displayed at one 
place, though business delegations will still be sent by 
provinces as they are now. 
  Li also urged local trade officials to take advantage of the 
country's new trade policies issued this year, for example, the 
application of a single exchange rate, to boost their local 
exports. 
  While admitting that the new policies have room to improve, 
the vice-premier called on trade authorities to improve them and 
to take measures to prevent possible problems from arising. 
  For example, Li said, foreign importers may unreasonably 
depress the prices of Chinese products, while Chinese exporters 
may also unreasonably raise the prices, all resulting in a rise 
of the cost of foreign currencies. 
  Li pointed out that the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system and multinational operation should be the direction taken 
for the remolding of China's foreign trade enterprises. 
  However, the vice-premier noted that the remolding should be 
properly approved and strictly follow the instructions of the 
State Council so as to hold mistakes to a minimum. 
  He stressed that in forming stock holding companies, 
internal 
shares must be limited to the promulgated amount as a measure 
against the loss of state-owned assets. 
  In his speech, the vice-premier also talked of improving the 
investment environment and training more competent foreign trade 
professionals.

(2806 0202 1627)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Today, Li Ruihuan, 
member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing 
Committee, cordially met with 95 representatives of national 
model workers who had arrived in Beijing for "May 1st" 
celebrations, and had a group photo taken with them to mark the 
occasion. 
  Li Ruihuan delivered an important speech during the meeting. 
First of all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the 
State Council, he paid high tribute to the model workers at the 
meeting, and extended season's greetings to workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, and the working masses of all nationalities on 
all fronts across the country! 
  Li Ruihuan said: Marxism's maintaining labor is of the 
utmost importance. Labor creates the world, social wealth, and 
a happy life, and promotes the progress of the civilization of 
mankind. Fundamentally speaking, all advanced systems and 
policies are formulated for the purpose of encouraging and 
protecting people's honest, vigorous, and creative labor. Model 
workers are outstanding representatives of laborers. The model 
workers' advanced thinking and splendid deeds carry forward the 
traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, make clear to all the 
course for the era to forge ahead on, should be commended by the 
party and government and respected by all walks of life, and 
should become examples for all the people across the country to 
learn. 
  Li Ruihuan pointed out: China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization have entered a new phase. "Seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability" constitute the overall 
situation of our work in the country. The destiny of China's 
working class has always been closely interrelated to that of 
the party and state. The party and government believe the broad 
masses of staff and workers will conscientiously subordinate 
themselves to and serve [the needs of] this overall situation, 
properly do their duties in a down-to-earth manner, and give 
full play to their role as the main force. 
  He said: No doubt, reform can benefit the overwhelming 
majority of people, but it cannot benefit all the people at the 
same time or to the same extent. At present, the improvement of 
the living standards of some staff and workers and some of the 
masses has been achieved at a slow pace and they have even 
encountered some temporary difficulties due to various reasons. 
Naturally, the party and government should be concerned with 
them. As a mass organization of the working class and as a 
bridge and link between the party and staff, workers, and the 
masses, trade unions should treat representing and protecting 
the interests of staff, workers, and the masses and helping them 
solve problems encountered in their livelihood as their basic 
responsibilities. Trade unions at all levels must carry forward 
their fine traditions, frequently go deep into the realities of 
life, maintain close links with the masses, pay more visits to 
localities that encounter difficulties to appreciate their 
situation, and call on more comrades who hold different opinion 
to have a heart-to-heart talk with them and to offer them 
services; they must enthusiastically and attentively listen to 
the voice of the masses, understand their wishes, and report 
problems accurately to the party and government departments in 
good time; they must do solid work with all their heart and all 
their might, continue to successfully carry out the project of 
sending warmth to the masses, and help them solve difficulties; 
and they must painstakingly do a good job of conducting 
ideological work with patience, eliminate contradictions, boost 
the morale of the masses, and win their understanding and 
support. 
  Finally, Li Ruihuan said: Our great motherland has an 
immeasurably bright future and we are full of confidence in our 
future. Let us unite, work hard, surmount difficulties, and 
continuously promote the great undertaking of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC 
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. 
  Among the leading comrades participating in the meeting were 
Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, 
Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, 
and Wan Guoquan.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (CNS) -- Minister of the State 
Planning Commission Mr. Chen Jinhua said recently that 
stabilizing prices and controlling inflation were key needs for 
reform, development and stability and were pressing tasks in the 
economic sector. 
  Mr. Chen said that the serious problems at present were the 
worsening of inflation and a too fast increase in prices. The 
retail sales price index continues to rise based on last year's 
increase of 13 percent, a situation seldom seen since reform 
started. In particular, soaring prices for daily necessities, 
basic services and basic production means which were close to 
people's living and national economic development were 
intolerable to certain sectors. 
  Mr. Chen said that the issue of inflation had drawn the 
closest attention of the central authorities and the State 
Council had taken a series of measures recently to control 
prices. These were first, strict control over the speed of 
increase in fixed assets investment and the over-expansion of 
consumption fund. Second, much attention paid to agricultural 
production and the "food basket" project aimed at increasing 
supply. Third, strengthened government supervision and 
administration over prices including the establishment of price 
risk funds for grain and non-stable food, supervision over 
prices of 20 kinds of daily necessities and basic services, 
marked prices for commodity goods and services and price 
inspections throughout the country. Fourth, certain economic 
measures to control prices had been adopted to strengthen 
transportation of goods and materials and guarantee market 
supply. Authorities at various levels had also adopted a series 
of such measures. 
  Mr. Chen said that government must control and administer 
prices under the situation of the socialist market economy which 
was the common experience of all countries practising market 
economy. In the situation where most commodity prices had been 
formed by market forces, there was a pressing need to set up and 
improve a price control system.

  [Text] Hefei, April 30 (XINHUA)--Anhui Province, which took 
the lead in the national rural reform, will adopt a package of 
policies to consolidate and develop agriculture. 
  According to Governor Fu Xishou, one of them is to improve 
the contract responsibility system for land utilization. "This 
is the key to stabilizing rural policies," he said. 
  The provincial government has decided that after the 15-year 
contracts for land utilization expire this year, farmers may 
renew their contracts for 30 years more. 
  During the contract period farmers are entitled to lease or 
mortgage the land or become share-holders. 
  The period of contracting for barren mountains, land and 
water surface may extend up to 70 years. 
  Anhui is one of China's major agricultural provinces. 
Although some five million rural laborers left the fields for 
urban areas to seek employment last year, the province still 
reaped a grain harvest of 25.96 million tons, an increase of 
10.8 percent over the previous year and becoming the only 
province in southern China to record a grain increase. 
  The past decade has seen this East China province not only 
become self-sufficient in grain but also sell more than two 
billion kg of grain a year to other parts of the country. 
  "The establishment of a grain reserve system and a grain 
risk 
foundation is another measure," the governor noted. 
  The provincial government plans to reserve 600 million kg of 
grain to ensure timely grain purchase from farmers and arouse 
their enthusiasm for farm production. 
  In addition, Anhui will increase its input into agriculture. 
  While continuously boosting its grain output, the provincial 
government is determined to pay attention to quality and 
efficiency in line with market needs. 
  It will concentrate on the production of quality rice, 
cotton, oil-bearing crops, tea, livestock and poultry, silk, 
fruit, vegetables, aquatic products, traditional Chinese herbal 
medicines and edible fungus this year. 
  According to the governor, the government will select 10 
counties, 20 production bases and 50 administrative villages to 
try out an overall agricultural development project. 
  Meanwhile, the government is determined to reform the census 
registration system to gradually transfer 10 million surplus 
rural laborers to urban areas. 
  At present, the governor noted, Anhui is growing grain on 
six 
million ha of land, and is expected to produce 25 billion kg of 
grain this year, about the same as last year. Its summer crops 
are growing well. 
  The governor disclosed that the province still has three 
million people, accounting for five percent of the provincial 
population, living below the poverty line. 
  The provincial government has vowed to exert more efforts to 
help these people to rise above the poverty line within three to 
five years and live comfortable lives within eight years. 
  To reduce farmers' financial burdens, the provincial 
government has already revoked 87 charges.

<F P=106> [Report on work of the government given by Li Qiyan, mayor </F>
of Beijing Municipality, at the second session of the 10th 
Beijing Municipal people's congress on 8 April] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies: 
  I now submit a report on behalf of the Beijing Municipal 
people's government, to the present session for examination. 
<H5>  1. Review of 1993 </H5>
  Nineteen ninety-three was a year in which we upheld the 
party's basic line, comprehensively implemented the guidelines 
of the 14th party congress, and made big strides forward along 
the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the Beijing Municipal party committee, the people 
of various nationalities across the municipality emancipated 
their minds, advanced in a pioneering spirit, accelerated the 
pace of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, 
conscientiously implemented the resolutions of the first session 
of the 10th municipal people's congress, fulfilled and 
overfulfilled the national economic and social development plan, 
and comprehensively realized the fighting objective of 
surpassing the achievements of the previous year. 
  A. The national economy increased by a large margin, the 
markets were brisk, and the people's living was further 
improved. The total gross domestic products during the year 
were valued at 85.2 billion yuan, up 12 percent over the 
previous year. The local financial revenue reached 8.41 billion 
yuan, up 4.8 percent. In grain production, the exceptionally 
serious drought which was rarely seen for 50 years was overcome. 
The per-unit area yield reached 415.7 kg and the total output 
reached 2.84 billion kg, all setting the best records in history 
and marking the year as the 16th bumper harvest year. The 
production of major, nonstaple foods steadily increased, the 
varieties were abundant, and the supply was adequate. Township 
enterprises maintained a strong trend of development with total 
income reaching 46.87 billion yuan, up 63.2 percent over the 
previous year. The pace to develop the mountainous areas was 
accelerated. The average per-capita labor income of 60 outlying 
remote townships and towns reached 1,189 yuan, up 19.3 percent. 
Under the situation in which funds and electricity were in short 
supply, the industrial sector accelerated the pace of structural 
readjustment, technological transformation, and development of 
new products, with the added value reaching 32.4 billion yuan, 
up 10.2 percent over the previous year. Industrial enterprises 
at and above the township level created 15.42 billion yuan in 
profits and taxes, up 15 percent over the previous year, thus 
basically realizing a simultaneous increase in efficiency and 
rate. The growth rate of tertiary industry continued to surpass 
that of the secondary industry, and the added value it created 
reached 39.5 billion yuan, up 12.9 percent over the previous 
year, and its proportion in the gross domestic products rose 
from 44.3 percent in the previous year to 46.4 percent. Under 
the new situation in which production was developed and social 
demands increased, we upheld the principle of "buying products 
from all over the country, selling products to all parts of the 
country, encouraging all parts of the country to build markets 
and sell products in Beijing, serving the whole country, and 
marching towards the world," enriched the markets in the 
capital with plenty of commodities, kept the supply and 
marketing brisk, and realized 54.94 billion yuan in total retail 
sales of commodities, up 27.8 percent over the previous year. 
During the year, we built nine large-scale commercial centers, 
each covering an area of over 10,000 square meters to bring the 
total to 27; increased 44,000 new commercial service networks to 
a total 225,000, thus making things more convenient for the 
masses. Along with economic development, the living conditions 
of the people in the urban and rural areas was greatly improved, 
and if the price rise was factored in, the actual increase in 
the average per-capita wages of staff members and workers across 
the municipality was 7.8 percent; the average per- capita net 
income of peasants actually increased by 5.1 percent. The 
year-end savings deposits of urban and rural residents totaled 
56.07 billion yuan, up 44.2 percent over the previous year. 
  B. Urban and rural construction was quite rapid and new 
changes took place in the capital's appearance. Continued 
efforts were made in unswervingly putting the building of 
infrastructure facilities in the first place, accelerating the 
construction rate, and making an annual investment of 10.36 
billion yuan in this aspect, up 76.2 percent over the previous 
year. We added 415 km of new roads and built 15 overpasses in 
the urban areas. The capital airport expressway which is 
referred to as the first road leading to the country's gate was 
completed and attained international, first-grade standards. 
The east third ring road renovation project was started and 
completed within the same year, alleviating traffic congestion 
in the eastern part of the municipality. The Beijing section of 
the Beijing-Shijiazhuang expressway, Migu Road, Guangning Road, 
and other trunk lines and feeder lines in the urban and rural 
areas, were completed and opened to traffic, making the total 
traffic mileage of the whole municipality exceed 10,000 km, and 
enabling us to prefulfill the stipulated targets set for the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan by two years. New progress was made in 
the construction of the Beijing west passenger train station, 
the no.8 double-track subway line, the west third ring road 
renovation project, and other major projects. 
  The plan for 
the "project of not opening the sluice gate" to meet the power 
consumption peak by the end of 1995 was formulated. The new 
ways of developing electric power in the capital, such as 
jointly conducting power production with Inner Mongolia and 
bringing in foreign capital to build Shijingshan heat and power 
plant, were paved. A half of the second- phase project in 
building the ninth waterworks was accomplished. The first-phase 
project in building Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant whose 
scope is the largest in the country and whose technology and 
equipment are advanced, was accomplished and put into operation. 
Its daily capability of sewage treatment reaches 500,000 tonnes. 
The project of building the second pipe line in north China, 
which is supplying natural gas to Beijing Municipality, was 
accomplished. The newly-increased daily capability of gas supply 
in the year was 150,000 cubic meters and the newly increased 
acreage of areas that enjoyed the heat supply was 2.624 million 
square meters. The newly increased capacity of urban telephone 
exchanges was 360,000 lines and the newly increased number of 
urban telephone consumer households reached 187,000. The number 
of telephones in every 100 persons reached 14 and that in urban 
areas reached 23. The key project of rebuilding the municipal 
post facility that is the largest center of handling the postal 
matters in the country was put into operation. It has greatly 
relieved the strained situation in handling post matters and 
areas inside the second ring road have enjoyed the early 
delivery and sale of newspapers. The acreage of well-built 
houses in both urban and rural areas was 11.544 million square 
meters. The acreage in this regard has surpassed 10 million 
square meters over the past seven years. The municipality also 
mobilized the forces of various social circles to accelerate the 
construction of residential houses. The annual acreage of built 
residential houses reached 6.141 million square meters. The 
acreage in this regard has surpassed 5 million square meters 
over the past seven years. The "plan for having residents 
across Beijing Municipality enjoy sound housing conditions" in 
an effort to help residents overcome their housing difficulties 
caused by their middle and low incomes was formulated. The 
acreage of houses with sound conditions reached 100,000 square 
meters. The construction of satellite cities, county seats, 
towns with trade fair, and new rural villages achieved obvious 
progress. The municipality's rate of forest coverage reached 35 
percent and its urban greening rate reached 30.7 percent. Its 
urban environment was beautified and its living conditions 
improved. In the course of building a modernized city, the 
municipality enhanced consolidation over environmental pollution 
and the protection of the old city's views. 
  C. The undertakings of science, technology, education, 
culture, public health, and sports achieved new progress. Along 
with accelerating modernization in the capital, the thinking of 
regarding science and technology as a prime productive force was 
deeply instilled gradually into the hearts of people. Multiple 
social circles attached great importance to the undertakings of 
science and technology. Scientific and technical plans in 
various fields were smoothly enforced. The municipality scored 
3,024 scientific and technological results in the year and newly 
approved 5,806 patent items. The municipality popularized and 
applied 3,100 scientific and technological results and scored 
better economic results from them. The experiment zone of 
new-tech industrial development, the information industrial base 
in the zone, and the Fengtai and Changping scientific and 
technological parks, achieved rapid development. They have 
become the new rising forces for promoting the development of 
high-and-new-tech industries. The civilian-run scientific and 
technological enterprises achieved new development. The 
municipality scored some new results in integrating social 
science research closely with the new situation prevailing in 
reform, opening up, and modernizations and in deeply carrying 
out theoretical exploration in line with the establishment of 
socialist market economic systems. Education undertakings were 
continuously put in a position of preferential development 
strategy and the quality of education and teaching affairs was 
somewhat upgraded. By persistently following the school 
systems, the leading cadres of municipal level organs went deep 
into the schools on many occasions in the year to conduct their 
official work and to help them deal with their problems. The 
input in education increased. The spending on education set in 
the annual budget was 1.63 billion yuan and its proportion in 
the municipal financial expense was 20.1 percent. The pay of 
teachers, staff members, and workers was continuously upgraded 
and their income level was slightly higher than the average 
income of staff members and workers across the municipality. 
Funds for improving schooling conditions were raised through 
multiple channels. The municipality took the lead in the 
country in basically popularizing the compulsory nine-year 
education and eliminating illiteracy among persons in the prime 
of life. Infant and special education were enhanced. Adult 
education, secondary vocational and technical education, and 
vocational and technical training classes, were carried out 
extensively. The readjustment of courses among higher 
educational institutions began to have effect. Reform in the 
student enrollment systems of middle and primary schools was 
explored and reform in subjects for the college-qualification 
examination achieved smooth progress. Problems that emerged when 
some schools collected fees arbitrarily were cleared. 
Undertakings in literature and art, press and publication, and 
radio and television broadcasting achieved further development. 
A large number of outstanding works that eulogize the 
achievements of reform and opening up and reflect the practical 
life, including "Beijing Citizens in New York" and "The Lane of 
Gala," cropped up. 
  Beijing Television Station provided 
the round-the-clock broadcasting service, and "BEIJING RIBAO" 
and "BEIJING WANBAO" increased its number of pages. Protection 
of cultural relics was valued, and a group of cultural relics of 
the state and the municipal levels were repaired. New results 
were achieved in the patriotic public health campaign and in the 
work concerning medical treatment and health protection. The 
total incidence of major infectious diseases declined for 12 
years running. Education on medical ethics was strengthened, 
and the level of medical treatment and of medical teaching and 
scientific research was enhanced obviously. Marked results were 
achieved in family planning. The undertakings for the 
handicapped garnered universal concern and support of various 
circles in society. With the great trust placed on it by the 
people throughout the country, Beijing successfully hosted the 
Seventh National Games, and the Beijing delegation scored fine 
achievements in the games, thus promoting the development of 
mass sports activities. 
  D. Reform was deepened further and developed towards the new 
stage of effecting overall progress and making breakthroughs in 
key areas. The optimum-scale farming continued to improve, and 
a number of high-efficiency appropriate-scale farms took shape. 
The experiments for the rural share-holding cooperative system 
were expanded steadily, thus instilling new vitality and vigor 
to the development of township and town enterprises as well as 
agriculture. The restrictions on the policies towards mountain 
areas were relaxed by proceeding from the reality, thus 
promoting the development of mountain areas and helping these 
areas become prosperous. The "regulations on changing the 
operational mechanism of state-owned industrial enterprises" and 
the methods to implement the "regulations" were carried out in a 
profound manner, thus accelerating the change of operational 
mechanism of state-owned enterprises. Under the guidance of the 
State Commission for Restructuring Economy, the first light 
industrial general corporation took the lead in carrying out the 
comprehensive reform and explored a new path of invigorating 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. The 
comprehensive reform already extended to first commercial, 
agricultural machinery, aquatic products, food, and building 
materials trades. Tianqiao, Tianlong, Stone, and Beiren 
achieved success in selling their stocks to the places outside 
the municipality and the places outside the territory, thus 
pushing forward the reform of the shareholding system. Reform 
experiments such as enterprise groups, state-owned but 
people-run enterprises, and the shareholding cooperative system 
continued to improve. The sector of the economy not owned by 
the state was developed. Initial results were achieved in the 
reform of the public transportation system, with the contract 
for single cars as the main content. A key step was taken in 
pricing reform, prices of grain and cooking oil were basically 
decontrolled, and the risk-taking storage foundation for major 
agricultural and sideline products was established. The sale 
and transfer of land-use rights with compensation was carried 
out, thus increasing the income and benefit from land resources 
and initially establishing a relatively standardized real estate 
market. Petroleum exchange and commodity exchange were 
established and were successfully operated in line with the 
international standards, with their business volume keeping on 
rising. Monetary market was brisk, and the trading volume of 
negotiable securities reached 15.17 billion yuan. Professional 
personnel and labor service markets of various categories 
developed to 74 in number, and information and consulting 
markets developed rapidly. Markets played an increasingly 
obvious role in regulating economic activities. The program of 
making overall plans for curing major diseases of enterprise 
workers and staff was formulated and began to be tried out in 
Xicheng District, thus accelerating the reform of the social 
security system. The urban housing system reform touching upon 
the personal interests of numerous households was pressed 
forward steadily. On the basis of profound study and 
investigation, the program for reforming Beijing's government 
organs was drawn up, and the public servant training and wage 
reform were carried out step by step. All levels of governments 
cleared up non-permanent organs, streamlined administrative 
procedures, delegated powers to enterprises, positively 
transformed functions, and carried out experiments for the 
reform of the system on management of state-owned assets and 
property. At the same time, the central authorities' measures 
for strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and 
control were implemented, and the supervision, monitoring, 
regulation, and control over economic operation were 
strengthened. 
  E. The foreign funds utilized increased obviously, and major 
headway was made in opening up. In 1993, a total of 3,752 
foreign-funded enterprises of three types were newly approved. 
The projects each exceeding $10 million in enterprise scale, 
numbered 200 or more, and the average scale for these projects 
was 2.2 times the 1993 figure. The total number of 
foreign-funded enterprises of three types in the municipality 
reached 7,521, and the foreign capital actually utilized reached 
$2.85 billion. Some world-noted large corporations began making 
investments in Beijing. A number of joint ventures laid 
foundations and started construction in Beijing. Foreign 
investment extended to the spheres of infrastructure, commercial 
facilities, rebuilding of dangerous old houses, tourist 
facilities, and information consulting service. 
  To 
implement foreign investment projects as quickly as possible, 
the municipal government established an office for accelerating 
foreign capital utilization and persisted in the system whereby 
the screening and approval of the projects are a coordinated 
process, thus raising work efficiency. Throughout Beijing, 
1,753 foreign-funded enterprises of the three types went into 
business and became an important force in economic development. 
The three types of foreign-funded enterprises in the Beijing 
Municipal New-Tech Industrial Development Experimental Zone 
increased to 700; the Beijing Economic and Technological 
Development Zone completed the seven components of 
infrastructure and the leveling of ground for the construction 
of its 3.8-square-km start-up area, and 34 enterprises 
well-known at home and abroad "settled down" in the zone; 
infrastructural construction of district and county small 
industrial zones was accelerated, and 1,312 projects were 
already in these zones. The rapid and healthy development of 
the various development zones and small industrial zones became 
the new growth points for urban and rural economy. Foreign 
trade was expanded continuously, with the annual imports and 
exports totaling $3.08 billion, up 38.1 percent. Of the total, 
the volume of exports was $1.7 billion, up 10.9 percent, which 
was the largest annual increase in exports in our history. The 
quality of export commodities was improved, the proportion of 
the commodities with high added value increased, and the export 
market diversified. Another 55 enterprises obtained the import 
and export authority, the exports of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises amounted to 20.6 percent of the total 
exports of Beijing, and a new pattern of exports through 
multiple channels took shape. Overseas enterprises and 
construction projects and labor service cooperation undertaken 
abroad made new headway. Overseas tourists totaled 2.027 
million, and foreign exchange income from tourism was $1.24 
billion, an all-time record. Friendly exchanges with foreign 
countries became even more vigorous, and friendly ties were 
established with the capitals of four countries in the year. 
  F. We strengthened the socialist spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and the legal system. Taking advantage of the 
distribution of the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," we extensively created an upsurge in studying the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
further unified the thinking of cadres and the masses. In 
connection with the activities to mark the centennial of Mao 
Zedong's birth, we conducted the education on patriotism, 
collectivism, socialism, and outlook on life and value among the 
masses, especially youths, and achieved fairly good results. 
Although we failed by two votes in the bid to host the 2000 
Olympic Games due to numerous reasons, our bidding activities 
has increased the world's understanding about China and our 
understanding of the world, enabled us to make many friends, 
expanded our influence, enhanced the unity of the Chinese 
nation, uplifted our national spirit, and inspired the 
confidence and determination of our millions upon millions of 
people to go all out to make the country strong and build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The activities to 
present 100 educational movies on patriotic themes, to appraise 
and select advanced and model persons, and to "tour, love, and 
build Beijing" yielded a good social effect. A number of 
persons, such as Gao Sanxi, were praised by the masses for their 
heroic and model deeds and became the models for the people of 
various nationalities throughout Beijing to learn from. A vast 
number of people actively participated in the donations to the 
"hope project" designed to help children who were forced to 
discontinue schooling due to poverty. Prohibition against the 
firing of firecrackers won the understanding and support of the 
masses and was a success. Notable progress was achieved in 
national defense education, conscription work, and building of 
national defense reserve forces; the double-support work and 
army-police- civilian joint efforts in building civilized units 
were intensified; and building of grass-roots civilized units 
again made new headway. In improving the socialist democracy and 
legal system, governments at all levels in Beijing voluntarily 
subjected themselves to the supervision of people's congresses 
and their standing committees and adhered to the system of 
democratic consultation by the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] committees, democratic parties, 
and persons without party affiliation. We handled and replied 
to 2,154 motions and suggestions submitted by people's deputies 
and CPPCC members in the year and strengthened the work to 
solicit suggestions, people's letters and visits, and telephone 
calls to the mayor. We conscientiously implemented the party's 
policies on nationalities and religions and maintained the 
harmonious relations between various nationalities, political 
unity and cooperation, and mutual respect in religious belief, 
thus consolidating a stable and united situation. The 
advantages of the work concerning Overseas Chinese affairs and 
the work directed to Taiwan were developed to make new 
contributions to the construction of the capital. New 
experiences were gained in managing the city according to law. 
  The pace of formulating and perfecting the local rules was 
accelerated. Thirteen draft local rules and regulations were 
submitted to the municipal people's congress standing committee 
for examination and discussion during the year. The dynamics of 
enforcing administrative laws were expanded. Efforts were made 
to examine the situation of enforcing 15 laws, rules, and 
regulations. Through conscientious preparations, the people's 
policemen made their rounds to examine, on a trial basis, the 
enforcement of laws and were appraised by the people. The 
propaganda on popularizing the general knowledge of laws was 
extensively carried out. The number of persons who died from 
six kinds of abnormal accidents continued to be reduced. We 
mobilized the forces of all social circles to comprehensively 
improve social order; continued to wage special struggles 
against serious criminal offenders, "pornography," the "six 
vices," and "fake products;" cracked a number of cases of 
serious crimes; eliminated a group of criminal gangs; and 
safeguarded the stability of the capital. 
  G. Achievements in waging the current-stage struggle against 
corruption were made. Last year, the central authorities made a 
decision on opposing corruption. The Beijing Municipal CPC 
Committee paid high attention to the decision, and the 
governments at various levels conscientiously implemented it. 
Simultaneously, the broad masses of the people positively 
implemented the decision and also helped the governments 
overcome and correct corrosive phenomena. The municipality made 
achievements in fulfilling the three tasks for opposing 
corruption as defined by the central authorities. The majority 
of the units adopted a conscientious attitude toward the 
struggle and made better achievements. However, a small number 
of the units failed to do their jobs well and even perfunctorily 
and superficially engaged themselves in the struggle. The major 
achievements in opposing corruption and advocating 
administrative honesty are as follows: First, the government 
organs at various levels across the municipality and the cadres 
of the administrative and law enforcement departments at or 
above the section level generally convened the democratic 
activities in line with the central authorities' five 
regulations on administrative honesty and self-discipline and 
made self-investigations and self-corrections. Most of the 
problems that had been found out were resolved. Second, a large 
number of major and appalling cases were conscientiously 
investigated and handled. From September to December, the 
municipality investigated and handled 101 major cases of 
corruption and bribery each involving over 10,000 yuan in 
money, made public 37 major and appalling cases, and handled 46 
serious economic criminals according to laws. Third, the 
unhealthy trends of state organs abusing power to wantonly 
collect charges were basically controlled. The departments 
concerned under the municipal government canceled 211 items on 
unreasonable collection of charges, and the district and county 
governments canceled 341 unreasonable charge collection items. 
In the struggle against corruption, the governments at various 
levels reported the situation to the people's congresses, the 
CPPCC organizations, democratic parties, and the masses and 
accepted their supervision. At the same time, we combined 
administrative honesty with administrative diligence according 
to the requirements for "grasping administrative honesty to 
promote administrative diligence," did more good and concrete 
deeds for the people, and narrowed the distance in the 
relationship between the government and the people. 
  By reviewing the work done in the previous year, we deeply 
experienced that to achieve the work of the capital, we must 
persistently take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as a guidance, 
comprehensively implement the basic line of the party, 
ceaselessly emancipate the mind, proceed from reality, seek 
truth from facts, and boldly make explorations. Only by so 
doing will we have new ideas, make great accomplishments, and 
ceaselessly create a new situation in reform and construction. 
Only when we persist in the Marxist viewpoint that development 
is an essential criterion, firmly grasp the central link of 
economic construction, and enhance the sense of urgency for 
grasping the favorable opportunities will we be able to bring 
our advantages into play, ceaselessly break obstacles, overcome 
difficulties, and make development in all undertakings. So long 
as we persist in the purpose of wholeheartedly serving the 
people, carefully experience and observe the people's feeling, 
engage in less talk but more work, do solid work, 
conscientiously help the people solve their practical problems, 
and set the highest possible standards to be attained by the 
government, will we be able to enjoy the trust and support of 
the people and lay a firm foundation for our work. Only when we 
pay high attention to safeguarding the situation characterized 
by stability and unity and resolutely deal blows to the 
phenomena of damaging stability and hindering unity will we be 
able to consolidate the established achievements and ensure the 
smooth realization of the capital's grand blueprint for 
socialist modernization. 
  Fellow deputies, the great achievements in building the 
capital over the past year were the results of the united 
efforts of the people of various nationalities across the 
municipality on the basis of the good work in the past. Here, 
let me extend heartfelt thanks on behalf of the municipal 
government to the broad masses of workers, peasants, cadres, and 
intellectuals who actively participated in the capital's 
socialist modernization drive, to deputies, CPPCC members, and 
personages from various democratic parties, mass organizations, 
and all social circles for their great support and supervision, 
and to central units stationed in Beijing, fraternal provinces, 
prefectures, and cities, the People's Liberation Army, and the 
armed police force who greatly supported our work, and to 
compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, Overseas Chinese 
compatriots, and international friends who cared for and 
supported the development of the capital. 
  While affirming the achievements, we should soberly 
recognize 
that there are still many difficulties and problems on our road 
of advance, and there are shortcomings and deficiencies in the 
government work. The prominent ones were: The funds were in 
short supply; the infrastructure facitilies, such as power and 
gas supply, communications and telecommunications, were still 
far from meeting the needs of the development of production and 
the people's living; a considerable number of state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises still could not extricate 
themselves from the difficult position of earning low profits 
and suffering deficits; the rise in the retail price index was 
quite high and the rise reached 16.9 percent; there were many 
inconveniences and prominent difficulties in the life of the 
masses; the quality of some small housing community projects was 
not high, the supporting facilities were imperfect, and the 
dismantling and relocation work was not well implemented in some 
places; some places lacked relevant systems, laws, regulations, 
and methods in the management of the inflow of transients, trade 
fairs, and environmental protection and sanitation, and failed 
to follow and strictly enforce laws; some units, particularly 
some leading organs, failed to pay full attention to spiritual 
civilization, allowing the phenomenon of being tough with one 
hand and soft with the other hand to exist; although great 
efforts were made in public security work, the situation was not 
optimistic, and serious cases increased in number; the problems 
of overstaffed government organs and low working efficiency 
still could not be fundamentally solved, some leading organs and 
leading cadres still practiced formalism and bureaucratic work 
style at varying degrees, some cadres even abused their powers 
to seek personal gains, a small number of people were morally 
degenerated, violated law and discipline, and seriously damaged 
the flesh-blood relationship between the government and the 
masses of people. We should pay great attention to these 
problems and conscientiously solve them, and we earnestly hope 
that all deputies will give criticism and suggestions. 
<H5>  2. The Work of 1994 </H5>
  The year 1994 is a crucial one for implementing the decision 
of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee 
and establishing the socialist market economic structure, and an 
important year for accelerating the capital's socialist 
modernization drive in accordance with the demand of the State 
Council's written reply on the "Beijing urban overall plan." 
The CPC Central Committee has comprehensively analyzed the 
situation at home and abroad and defined this year's basic 
principles for the work of the whole party and the whole 
country: It is necessary to take the theory of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line as the guidance, comprehensively 
implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the 
third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee, 
accelerate the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure, maintain a sustained, rapid, and sound national 
economic development, maintain political stability, and promote 
comprehensive social progress. The overall situation of the 
work of the whole party and the whole country is to seize the 
opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote 
development, and maintain stability. Governments at all levels 
across the municipality should submit their work to and serve 
this overall situation, grasp the situation, exert efforts to 
accomplish something, and continue to push the capital's all 
construction undertakings forward. 
  Last October, the State Council approved the newly revised 
"Beijing urban overall plan," and issued an important 
eight-point written rely. This is a blueprint for guiding the 
capital's development for this century and next and an 
scientific basis for urban construction and management. The 
overall plan proposed: By the year 2010, Beijing's social 
development, and the economic, scientific, and technological 
comprehensive strength should attain or even surpass the the 
level of capital cities of the moderately developed countries in 
some aspects, thus laying a foundation for building Beijing 
into a first-grade modernized international city by the middle 
of the 21st century. 
  We should thoroughly publicize and 
resolutely implement the overall plan, most extensively mobilize 
the forces of the people of various nationalities in Beijing, 
make each year's work a success, and march toward the grand goal 
of modernizing the capital in a down-to-earth manner. 
  In line with the central instructions, the guidelines of the 
second session of the eighth National People's Congress, the 
resolution on fulfilling the major tasks of the 10-year program 
three years ahead of schedule and attaining the strategic target 
of a fairly comfortable life approved at the first session of 
the 10th municipal people's congress, and the specific 
conditions of Beijing, we should put the endeavor to maintain 
stability in the capital above everything else, handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability well, 
further emancipate the mind, firmly seize the opportunity, 
achieve breakthroughs in key areas, and make a bigger stride in 
reform and construction to achieve a fairly comfortable life 
ahead of schedule. The major targets of Beijing's economic and 
social development are to achieve a 10-percent increase in terms 
of comparable prices in the gross domestic product to make it 99 
billion yuan, which, translated, means a 3.5-percent increase in 
primary industry, 9.8-percent increase in secondary industry, 
and 11.5-percent increase in tertiary industry; and to actively 
promote science and technology, education, and other social 
undertakings and further strengthen the socialist spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and legal system to further improve 
people's material and cultural life. 
  A. We should make great efforts to adjust the structure and 
improve efficiency to bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. 
  One of the basic targets put forward in Beijing's overall 
urban plan is to establish an economy which is led by high and 
new technology, in which the tertiary industry is developed, the 
industrial composition is rational, and efficiency and quality 
are high, and which conforms to the characteristics of the 
capital. Focusing on upgrading the quality and efficiency of 
economic growth, we should make great efforts to adjust the 
structure, develop an economy compatible with the 
characteristics of the capital, and maintain sustained, rapid, 
and healthy economic development this year. 
  Agriculture, which concerns the national economy and 
people's 
livelihood, is the major work influencing the overall situation. 
The more modern the city becomes, the more we should consolidate 
the position of agriculture as the foundation and make efforts 
to develop agriculture successfully. We should resolutely 
implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference 
and make sure that this year's grain output is stabilized, 
per-unit yields are raised, and major nonstaple food continues 
to increase. To attain this, we should continue to improve the 
policies in support of agriculture, speed up formulation of 
regulations on protection of basic farmland, and conscientiously 
protect cultivated land. We should intensify construction of 
nonstaple food production bases, make the "vegetable basket" 
project a success, adhere to the principle of "making outer 
suburbs the major vegetable producers, increasing the vegetable 
production of outskirt areas, and regulating vegetable supplies 
by importing from other localities," and increase the areas sown 
to vegetables by 150,000 mu. We should continue to increase 
agricultural investment and raise funds from various channels to 
support agricultural development. We should further reduce the 
burdens on peasants to protect peasants' interests. We should 
persist in developing agriculture through the application of 
science and technology and promotion of education and stabilize 
and strengthen the contingent of agricultural scientific and 
technical personnel. We should actively explore the new road of 
rural reform and, proceeding from the reality of Beijing's 
suburbs, further improve and develop the method of operation on 
as large a scale as possible in the economically developed plain 
areas, promote the coordinated process of production, 
processing, and marketing, bring about high yields, high 
quality, and high efficiency in agriculture by raising labor 
productivity by a large margin, and then increase peasants' 
income. In economically underdeveloped areas, we should 
continue to stabilize and improve the household- based 
output-related contract responsibility system but should never 
seek uniformity in the forms we adopted. We should continue to 
improve the farm and sideline product distribution system, speed 
up construction of central wholesale markets for farm and 
sideline products and specialized wholesale markets for grain, 
meat, and vegetables, increase reserves, and maintain a rational 
stock. Township enterprises should add impetus to the reform 
designed to establish the shareholding system, improve their 
management, and continue to "expand their scale, adopt a new 
layout, develop the export-oriented economy, and adopt new 
mechanisms, new technology, and new equipment." 
  We should 
actively promote the construction of central towns with trade 
fairs and new rural villages. In line with the principles of 
"building up the mountainous areas with the money earned from 
business established in outside places," "entering markets in 
order to become better-off," and of "living off the mountain 
when living on a mountain," we should delegate more 
self-determination rights to mountainous areas in the fields of 
land management and development and in production. Efforts 
should be made to accelerate, in an overall way, the progress of 
rural areas in becoming better-off by integrating the 
introduction of funds, technologies, and talented personnel with 
the establishment of enterprises in flatland; and by opening the 
mountainous areas and natural resources to outside places and 
developing the production to gradually reduce the economic gap 
between mountainous and flat areas. 
  According to the principle of concentrated high technology 
of 
high additional value, the less energy consumption, the less 
water consumption, the less pollution, the less transport 
volume, and the less land occupation of products, industrial 
enterprises should keep markets in view; readjust their 
structure; and increase their economic results. Efforts should 
be made to extensively apply new technologies to improving the 
traditional industries to accelerate the readjustment of 
technological structure and product mix. By adopting effective 
measures, we should promote the development of the three pillar 
industries of motor vehicles, electronics, and new building 
materials, as well as of backbone industries. We should conduct 
reform in the existing managerial system of auto industry and 
reinforce the investment made in the industry so as to enable 
the principal leading products of automobiles to be improved in 
standardization and level, to accelerate their replacement and 
renewal, and to meet the demands of markets. Electronic 
industries should concentrate their forces in various fields on 
organizing enterprise groups by regarding their products that 
enjoy brisk sales as a guide, accelerate the enforcement of the 
"electronic town" plan in Jiuxianqiao, and do a good job in 
grasping the key projects of producing video camera and 
program-control telephone exchanges. Industries in charge of 
producing new building materials should intensify their work of 
building the "building material town" in Xisanqi and of inviting 
business and bringing in capital from foreign countries. 
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to ensure the construction of 
the ethylene plant in the year and to concentrate efforts on 
building a large number of key projects, including the heat 
rolling mill. We should accelerate the technical progress of 
enterprises and enable the major equipment of one-third key 
enterprises to achieve replacement and renewal this year and to 
improve their technical level. Enterprises should fully 
understand the new situation in which China is going to restore 
the position of original signatory state to the GATT treaty, 
actively readjust their products' mix in line with the demands 
of both domestic and foreign markets, improve their products' 
quality, enforce the international standard, enhance their 
competitive capability, and create more products that enjoy 
brisk sales and have famous trademarks. 
  We should accelerate the establishment of a tertiary 
industrial system that serves the capital, keeps the country and 
the world in view, is complete with functions and rational 
allocation, and renders first-grade service. The municipality 
plans to have the increased value of tertiary industries account 
for 47.5 percent in the municipal gross domestic product this 
year and to have social retail sales show a 20 percent increase. 
Efforts should be continuously made to support and encourage 
the development of industries and trade of finance, insurance, 
technical trade, communication and transportation, post and 
telecommunications, information and consultation, and tourism. 
The construction of financial street should be accelerated. In 
line with the principles of formulating unified plans, making 
rational allocation, and meeting the demands of different 
consumers, we should push forward in an overall way the 
construction and rebuilding of commercial service facilities in 
various fields. We should ensure the complete construction and 
operation of 10 large shopping centers with acreage of over 
10,000 square meters. Efforts should be continuously made to 
develop small commercial networks and centers that are 
convenient for the people; to vigorously reform the old business 
areas in the downtown area and a large number of district-run 
shopping centers; and try to open supermarkets, chain stores, 
and commodity distributing centers that are suitable to the 
consumption characteristics of the country. We should 
accelerate the construction of indoor trade fairs and gradually 
enable peddlers to bring their outdoors business indoors. The 
role of the large wholesale enterprises should be brought into 
play. The level of modernizing the storage facilities at 
various fields should be upgraded and their storage capability 
should be enhanced. 
  Fellow deputies: Boosting the large and medium-sized 
enterprises represents not only the key to maintaining 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy and the foundation of establishing the systems of 
socialist market economy but also a decisive role in 
safeguarding social stability. Reasons for the difficulties 
encountered by some enterprises at present and for the poor 
economic results scored by these enterprises are of problems in 
their business mechanism and also of their social burdens, their 
left-over troubles, and their poor internal management. 
  We 
should have the greatest determination, exert utmost efforts, 
and wholeheartedly rely on the working class to improve large 
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises through every possible 
means. This year, we will adopt the following measures. First, 
we will conscientiously disseminate the experiences of the First 
Light Industrial General Corporation, add impetus to the 
adjustment of the industrial composition and product mix in 
coordination with the adjustment of the functions of urban land 
use, and optimize land resources to lead enterprise development. 
Second, we will accelerate reform of the social security 
system, improve the external environment for the production and 
operation of enterprises, conscientiously reduce the burden on 
enterprises, and facilitate the transformation of their 
operating mechanism. Third, we will continue to increase 
investment, organize forces to tackle major scientific and 
technological difficulties, and expedite enterprises' technical 
transformation. We will consolidate and develop those with 
large profits and taxes and give them preferential treatment in 
terms of policies and funds so that the number of such 
enterprises increases. Fourth, we will apply the leadership 
responsibility system to the study of the different conditions 
of the enterprises which lose money or earn meager profits and 
adopt measures commensurate with their specific conditions to 
promote their development. Enterprises capable of reducing 
deficits and increasing profits should be supported so that they 
can extricate themselves from the difficult situation and 
achieve development. Those which hold no promise of reducing 
deficits and whose assets cannot pay off their debts should 
close, suspend production, merge with others, or change their 
production lines more rapidly, and, after experiments, some of 
them should go bankrupt according to law. Meanwhile, the life 
and reemployment of their staff members and workers of should be 
properly arranged. Fifth, we will formulate policies to bravely 
lead enterprises out of their difficult situation through 
diverse production, joint management, introduction of funds from 
abroad, "multiple systems at one plant," and the shareholding 
system. Sixth, enterprises should make painstaking efforts to 
improve themselves, strengthen management, lower production 
cost, reduce material consumption, and pursue better efficiency 
through better management. 
  B. Focusing on Infrastructural Facilities and Residential 
Housing Construction, We Should Accelerate Urban Construction 
and Greatly Strengthen Management of the City. 
  In urban construction, we should take the overall plan and 
the written reply of the State Council as the guide, consider it 
a requirement to build a modernized international city, and 
persist in the two strategic shifts, namely shifting the focus 
of urban construction from the city proper to outer suburbs and 
shifting the focus of the construction of city proper from 
building new projects to adjustment and renovation. This is the 
key to raising the urban and rural modernization level. 
  Infrastructural facilities are the prerequisite which the 
city relies on for its survival and development. The earlier 
and more actively we pay attention to them, the better it will 
be. We should concentrate efforts on weak links and strive for 
new breakthroughs. we should attach great importance to and 
achieve success in the development of the power industry of the 
capital. To make sure that shortage in power will be eliminated 
by the end of 1995, we year step up cooperation with the Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region this year in power development 
projects and the construction of the Shijingshan Power Plant, 
the Mingling pumped-storage hydroelectric station, and other 
power projects. We should continue to promote road construction 
and, within this year, complete the renovation of the northwest 
third ring road and the Fushi Road, the construction of the 
sidewalk facilities on Changan Street, and the construction of 
the Jingtong, Jingzhang, and Shunping highways. The Beijing 
West Railway Station should take an initial shape within this 
year, and double tracking of the eight subway lines should be 
accelerated. The second-phase project of the No. 9 Water Works 
should be completed. Key gas and heat supply projects, such as 
the gas increase of the coking plant and the expansion of the 
Zuojiazhuang Heat Supply Plant, should be made successful to 
increase fuel gas consumers by 120,000 and increase the floor 
space with central heat supply systems by 2 million square 
meters. We should step up the beginning stages of preparations 
for the supply of natural gas from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia 
to Beijing and the project to "divert water from the south to 
the north." We should greatly develop post and 
telecommunication, change all the switchboards in urban and 
outskirt areas into program-controlled ones within this year, 
and increase urban telephone subscribers by 300,000 to alleviate 
the difficulty in "installing telephones." 
  Only a secure life can guarantee a happy life. Improving 
the housing conditions is the strong desire of the broad masses 
of people and the key to realizing a better life is one of the 
priorities of the government work of this year. Recently, 
Beijing has continued to build a great number of residential 
houses, but is still far from meeting the needs. At present, a 
considerable number of residents in cities and towns are living 
in a crowded place with very poor conditions. We must step up 
our efforts to implement the project of building houses with 
sound conditions. This year, the houses which are completed and 
commissioned and with sound living conditions must not be less 
than 300,000 square meters. Continued efforts should be made to 
grasp the renovation of dangerous and old houses and the 
development of new housing communities, and gradually increase 
the proportion of housing construction projects in outlying and 
suburban areas, especially in satellite cities. The completed 
housing areas during the year should exceed 6.5 million square 
meters. It is necessary to guarantee the quality of 
construction projects, pay great attention to solving the 
problems of residents in the supply of electricity, gas, water, 
heating, communications, and telecommunications, and ensure 
that, in the course of building new houses, the main part of a 
construction project and the urban administrative service 
facilities are built simultaneously. While doing a good job in 
building residential houses, we should continue to deepen reform 
of the housing system in an effort to accelerate the pace of 
solving the housing problems of residents in cities and towns. 
We should strengthen efforts to grasp the building of key 
public facilities. In building new projects in the cities, we 
should pay attention to protecting the style of the old capital 
and manifesting the spirit of the times, national traditions, 
and local distinctive features. 
  The work of making the environment green and beautiful and 
raising the quality of the environment is the basic urban 
construction project which must be grasped with unremitting 
efforts. This year, in order to realize the objective of making 
the municipal forest coverage rate reach 40 percent by the end 
of this century, we should extensively, deeply, and solidly, 
conduct all-people voluntary tree-planting activities, continue 
to build tracts of forests to separate the city from other 
localities and sanitation protection forests, and plant trees 
along 15 roads, including the third ring road, and residential 
areas, such as Fangzhuang. In the suburban areas, we should 
plant trees on barren hills, beaches, and areas plagued by wind 
and sand, make the overall environment green, and actively 
develop flower industry. It is necessary to punish in line with 
law acts of misappropriating green areas and damaging forests 
and green projects in an effort to check the seizure of green 
isolated areas. We should attend to the building of key 
projects, such as the second phase of the Gaobeidian water 
disposal plant project, Asuwei trash disposal area, and other 
environmental protection projects, do a good job in cutting off 
the polluted water of Liangshui He and harnessing the Tonghui 
He, further improve water, air, and sound pollution, and 
strengthen the pollution-free disposal and comprehensive use of 
wastes and discarded things. On the basis of improving the 
environment, we should strengthen the building of water 
conservancy projects in urban and rural areas and the protection 
of natural resources. 
  Without well-organized scientific management, it is 
impossible to realize the objective of building a modern, 
international city. Particularly under the situation in which 
the pace of urban construction is being accelerated, we need all 
the more to strengthen urban management. Planning is the 
"dragon head" of construction. We must follow the plan in 
carrying out construction projects, strictly follow the 
construction procedures, never yield to those who carry out 
unauthorized construction projects, and strictly punish them. 
We should improve traffic routes, strengthen traffic 
management, strictly enforce traffic laws and regulations, and 
maintain good traffic order. We should rely on the masses of 
people and professional law-enforcement departments, give full 
play to the functions of neighborhood offices, residents' 
committees and villagers' committees in comprehensive management 
and service, comprehensively check the acts of arbitrarily 
setting up stalls, misappropriating roads, and throwing trash on 
the ground that seriously affect the order of the municipality, 
and strive to greatly improve the city's appearance amd 
sanitation, and improve the environment of small residential 
areas. Meanwhile, we should strengthen the building of an urban 
disaster prevention system, do a good job in meteorological 
work, and strictly protect military facilities. 
  C. We should actively develop scientific, technological, 
educational, and cultural undertakings and promote a 
comprehensive social progress. 
  Science and technology are the primary productive forces, 
economic construction must rely on science and technology, and 
scientific and technological work must serve economic 
construction. We should give full play to the scientific and 
technological advantages of the capital, concentrate efforts on 
tackling difficult scientific and technical problems, and 
promote the progress of research, development, and 
industrialization of high and new technology. 
  Corresponding policies should be formulated and effective 
measures be adopted according to new circumstances to promote 
the development of new technology industrial development and 
experimental zones. The priorities for scientific and 
technological reform and development this year are as follows: 
First, the law on scientific and technological progress should 
be carried out in an all-round way, and the input in science and 
technology should increase. Second, effort should be made to 
establish a new type of structure that is suitable for the 
development of socialist market economy and for scientific and 
technological law and that closely combines science and 
technology with the economy. Efforts should also be made to 
stabilize the basic research, the research in applied sciences, 
and the research in new and high technology. Scientific and 
technological development institutes should be given a free hand 
and be encouraged to integrate themselves with enterprises in a 
bid to march towards the markets and enhance their development 
vitality. Third, scientific research and development should be 
strengthened, all trades of the national economy should be armed 
with advanced technology, traditional industries should be 
renovated with new and high technology, scientific and 
technological achievements should be translated into practical 
productive forces rapidly, and the important role of science and 
technology in invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises should be given into full play. Fourth, the scale of 
industrialization of science and technology should be expanded 
continuously. The "program for industrializing new and high 
technology" should be formulated and implemented. With the 
communications industry, power and electronics industries, 
computer, and bioengineering as key trades, new technology 
industrial development zones should guide scientific and 
technological enterprises to organize groups, carry out 
shareholding system, industrialize themselves, and march towards 
international markets. Construction of the biological city of 
Beijing University and of the power and electronics industrial 
base should be accelerated. Fifth, positive support and 
encouragement should be given to create even more and even 
better popular science works, rich and colorful popular science 
publications should be initiated, scientific and technological 
museums should be established, and scientific and technological 
knowledge should be made universal among the vast numbers of the 
masses, youths and children in particular. 
  The strategic principle on developing education on a 
priority 
basis should be upheld, and the "program for China's educational 
reform and development" should be implemented resolutely. With 
the improvement of educational and teaching quality as the core, 
the educational reform should be deepened continuously, and more 
investment should be made in education with a view to promoting 
the development of educational undertakings. Compulsory 
education should be run with the government investment 
primarily, and, at the same time, the society and the people 
should be encouraged to raise funds to run this education. On 
the basis of making the compulsory education universal 
basically, attention should be paid to consolidating and 
improving the compulsory education, and great efforts should be 
exerted to resolve the problem concerning the peak of students 
entering middle schools so as to avoid the emergence of the 
two-shift system. At the same time, the education at the senior 
middle school stage should develop vigorously, and various 
circles in society should be fully mobilized to utilize such 
modernized communication means as radio and television to 
develop vocational education, adult education, and all kinds of 
social education with a view to training practical professionals 
and the scarce professionals in line with market demands. 
Higher educational departments should reform the system of 
running universities and colleges, accelerate the readjustment 
of the layout of universities and colleges and the structure of 
disciplines, expand the autonomy of universities and colleges, 
and positively and appropriately reform the systems concerning 
enrollment, tuition collection, and graduate employment. The 
pre-school education and special education should develop 
continuously. All schools should persist in the principle of 
promoting the moral, intellectual, and physical development of 
students, and should strengthen and improve moral education in 
order to train competent professionals for the socialist 
modernization. To vitalize the nation, the hope lies in 
education, and to vitalize education, the hope lies in teachers. 
The "PRC's law on teachers" should be implemented 
conscientiously, and the drawing-up of the detailed rules for 
implementing this law should be completed by the end of this 
year. All levels of governments and all pertinent departments 
should focus their educational investment on building the ranks 
of teachers with a view to improving remunerations and housing 
conditions for teachers and raising the social position of 
teachers. Attention should be paid to teacher-training 
education to expand the source of teachers, improve the quality 
of teachers, build up a contingent of teachers who are advanced 
in ideology, excellent in professional knowledge, and devoted to 
the people's educational undertakings. The fine habit of 
respecting teachers and education should be formed throughout 
the society in order to make teaching an occupation most 
respected by the people. 
  Economic development depends on science and technology. 
Scientific and technological competition depends on skilled 
persons. We should bring into full play Beijing's advantages of 
having a galaxy of talents, adopt various forms and ways to 
cultivate a large number of specialized talents and laborers 
with modernized production techniques, and cultivate a group of 
academic and technical leaders spanning this century and the 
next. It is necessary to combine the cultivation of skilled 
persons with the reasonable use of skilled persons. We should 
boldly break rules to select and promote the skilled persons 
with prominent contributions, give heavy awards to them, give 
priorities to improving their working and living conditions, and 
create environments and conditions for bringing into full play 
the skilled persons' talents and having the people of talents 
coming forth in large numbers. We should continue to encourage 
and attract overseas skilled persons to serve the modernization 
of the motherland and the capital. 
  Beijing is a cultural center of the country. So, Beijing's 
standards for developing cultural undertakings must be high, and 
the cultural undertakings should be developing rapidly. The 
governments at various levels must pay high attention to 
cultural undertakings and enthusiastically support the cultural 
departments' reform and development. Each and every principal 
leader of the municipality should directly establish contacts 
with a literature and art organization to deeply conduct 
investigations and study and solve the practical problems 
cropping up in literary and artistic development. Priorities 
should be given to supporting and protecting the national 
cultural essences, excellent lofty and refined arts, and 
high-value academic works. This year, literary and artistic, 
press and publication, and radio and television departments 
should strive to select another group of excellent works 
enthusiastically singing the praises of reform, opening up, and 
modernization. It is necessary to bring into full play the 
functions of libraries, cultural centers, museums, exhibition 
halls, scientific and technological centers, and archives. We 
should accelerate the construction of such cultural facilities 
in the capital as libraries. We should continue to achieve the 
scientific protection and reasonable utilization of relics and 
appropriately open and also ceaselessly perfect the relic 
markets. We should positively conduct various forms of healthy 
mass cultural activities and enliven the urban and rural 
people's cultural activities. We should strengthen the 
management of cultural markets according to laws, wipe out 
feudalist superstition and pornographic audio-video tapes and 
books, and purify the cultural environment. 
  We should carry out the policy of putting prevention first 
in 
medical work and further develop medical and public health 
undertakings. We should mobilize all social forces to further 
extensively conduct the patriotic and public health campaign of 
"striving to create a sanitation city." We should effectively 
control the occurrence of major infectious diseases and strictly 
examine the hygiene of food production and management units. We 
should positively achieve the medical work of the rural areas, 
develop the rural cooperative medical treatment system, 
consolidate three-level medical treatment and health care 
networks, and realize the target that everyone enjoys primary 
health care. We should persist in the construction of rural 
medical institutes and hospitals in the rural areas and 
fundamentally change the situation that the rural areas, 
particularly border, remote, and mountain areas, lack doctors 
and medicines. It is necessary to promote the reform of the 
medical treatment and public health spheres, to strengthen the 
improvement of medical ethics, and to upgrade the medical 
treatment quality and the medical service level. We should 
positively support the development of the undertakings for the 
handicapped. We should realistically achieve the work toward 
the aged people. We should conscientiously implement the 
regulations on family planning, particularly strengthen the 
management of birth control among the floating population and 
the people in the rural areas, persist in healthy birth and 
sound upbringing, and continue to control the population growth 
rate. 
  We should positively explore the reform of the sports 
management system in the new situation and promote the 
socialization of sports. We should extensively conduct the mass 
sports activities, carry out the all-people health care plan, 
and strive to upgrade the health quality of the people. 
  D. We should conscientiously solve the practical problems in 
the people's livelihood and ensure a stable improvement of the 
people's living standards. 
  Ceaselessly upgrading the people's material and cultural 
lives is the fundamental purpose of developing the socialist 
economy as well as a point to start with and end the government 
work. This year, the governments at various levels should focus 
their efforts on achieving two matters relating to the people's 
livelihood. First, the excessively faster increase in goods 
prices should be controlled. Second, the governments should try 
every possible means to resolve the living difficulties of the 
staff members and workers with low incomes. 
  During a recent period, the prices of the basic daily 
necessities rose quite rapidly, becoming one of the hot topics 
for discussion by the people. The party Central Committee and 
the State Council have attached great attention to this. The 
municipal party committee and the government believed that after 
basically decontrolling the prices, we must never give up 
adjusting and managing the commodity prices, resolutely adopt 
effective measures on our own initiative, comprehensively apply 
economic, legal, and necessary administrative means, and try by 
all possible means to control prices, particularly the rise of 
prices of farm and sideline products. First, we should 
implement the system of mayors and district and county heads 
assuming responsibility, exert strenuous efforts to grasp the 
"vegetable basket project," expand the production of grain, 
oil-bearing crops, vegetables, meat, eggs, milk, poultry, fish, 
and other major farm and sideline products, and guarantee supply 
and the relatively stable prices. Second, we should invigorate 
the circulation of commodities, reduce circulation links, reduce 
expenses, strengthen ties with the producing areas, and attract 
more commodities to enter Beijing. Third, we should establish 
and improve the major farm and sideline products storage system 
and the market risk-taking funds, do a good job in handling and 
regulating the products, and more promptly and effectively 
stabilize the excessively high prices. Fourth, we should seize 
the opportunity and strength of controlling commodity prices. 
On the premise of guaranteeing the steady issuance of central 
measures for adjusting prices, it is necessary to strictly 
control the municipal pricing reform items to be issued this 
year. Regarding those items which must be issued this year, we 
should control the range of adjusting prices, properly arrange 
subsidies for staff members and workers, and carefully organize 
the implementation of this work. When the changes in the prices 
of the people's daily necessities and services are too frequent 
and the range of adjusting prices is too high, the price 
departments should examine and interfere with this. Fifth, we 
should conscientiously conduct general price inspection and 
resolutely and strictly handle in line with law the acts of 
raising prices without authorization, arbitrarily raising the 
standards of charges, violating the regulation of clearly 
marking the prices, arbitrarily raising prices on the excuse of 
tax increase, and seeking exorbitant profits by raising prices. 
Meanwhile, it is necessary to strictly enforce laws in the 
market, and deal strict blows to law-breaking elements and 
unlawful acts on manipulating the markets and mixing real 
products with false ones. Sixth, we should give further play to 
the role of the price analyzing and monitoring system and 
closely monitor the trend of market changes so that policy 
decisions can be taken in a timely manner. We should step up 
efforts to study and formulate laws and regulations to combat 
the practice of seeking exorbitant profits and further 
institutionalize the price management work. We should recognize 
that the rational price hikes are advantageous to the 
convergence of commodities in Beijing which is one of centers 
for establishing contacts domestically and internationally. We 
should deeply understand the people's concerns and worries 
towards commodity prices, and while adjusting the prices, strive 
to push the economy forward in an effort to unceasingly increase 
the incomes of the urban and rural people and make their 
increase in incomes higher than the increase in prices. Our 
task is to enable the people of various nationalities across the 
municipality to attain the well-off level of moderate prosperity 
ahead of schedule and to reach common prosperity through 
long-term and unremitting efforts. 
  At present, there are two kinds of people whose income 
enhancement is slow and the living is fairly difficult. The 
first kind of people are the low-income workers in cities and 
towns, which are mainly concentrated on difficult plants, shops, 
and schools, and the retired workers and residents who have no 
working ability. Regarding this kind of people, we should raise 
their living standards through various channels, such as 
deepening reform, developing production, carrying out 
diversified undertakings, raising economic efficiency, 
supporting them in terms of policies and giving them necessary 
subsidies. The second kind of people are the difficult 
households living in outlying remote mountainous areas. They 
are living in scattered places with poor production conditions 
and low ability to combat disasters. Regarding this kind of 
people, we may guide them to march towards prosperity by 
developing the mountain resources. Some of them may become 
prosperous by moving to the plains to participate in production 
labor. Support and relief should be given to a small number of 
people who cannot find a way out for the time being. 
  The affairs of cooking wood, rice, cooking oil, salt, 
clothes, foodstuffs, housing conditions, and transport means, 
are the big events related to the basic life and immediate 
interest of the people. Governments and leading cadres at all 
levels should must attach great importance on these events, show 
concern at all times for the weal and woe of the masses, and 
adopt every possible way and means to help the mass overcome 
their difficulties. As for the problems that cannot be dealt 
with at present, they should also present an explanation in a 
timely manner to obtain the understanding of the mass and 
actively create conditions for gradually dealing with them. 
Improving the people's lives represents a long-term and gradual 
process. We should uphold the socialist principles and policies 
on distributions to correctly deal with the relationship between 
immediate and long-term interest and between partial and whole 
interest. By proceeding from the conditions of the municipality 
and the country, we should carry forward the spirit of 
pioneering careers arduously, working industriously, and 
practicing economy; and vigorously guard against extravagance 
and waste. Showing concern for the people's lives represents a 
duty-bound task undertaken by governments at all levels. 
Therefore, we must make all-out efforts to resolutely and 
successfully implement the task. 
  E. We should continuously deepen the reform and accelerate 
the establishment of socialist market economic systems. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
formulated the overall plan for establishing the systems of 
socialist market economy and a series of important measures for 
reform have been successively issued. We must resolutely 
implement them, ensure the smooth enforcement of them, and 
strive to achieve substantial progress in the following aspects: 
  First, we should further deepen the enterprise reform and 
accelerate the establishment of modern enterprise systems. By 
closely following the target of shifting the management 
mechanism of enterprises, we should actively explore the 
effective way of establishing modern enterprise systems. Except 
for the enterprises assigned by the state for taking up the 
pilot work in this regard, various industries and trades across 
the municipality should select a large number of large and 
medium-sized enterprises to take up the pilot work. By bearing 
the reality in minds we should earnestly popularize the 
experience gained by the First Light Industrial General 
Corporation in the comprehensive associated reform so as to 
promote the increase of assets' value, the transfer of 
industries, the shifting of mechanism and function, and the 
transfer of staff members and workers. Efforts should be made 
to broaden the pilot work of reform in the shareholding system 
and to actively and adequately conduct the work of having stocks 
enter markets. An emphasis should be placed on developing a 
large number of transregional and transtrade large enterprise 
groups, chain enterprises, and comprehensive shopping centers 
that are with the public ownership as the mainstay and the 
property right combination as the link. The state-owned small 
enterprises should continue to conduct multiple reforms in 
having the state-owned enterprises run by civilians, enforcing 
contract and rent systems in enterprise management, establishing 
shareholding system, and conducting auction of property rights. 
Based on knowing well the property rights, the collectively 
owned enterprises in urban areas should conduct reform by 
adequately selecting the organizational style of enterprises. 
Efforts should be continuously made to push forward the 
optimization and reorganization of labor forces, which have been 
proved as effective; and to deepen the reform among the 
enterprise internal systems of labor affairs, personnel affairs, 
and distribution. Meanwhile, we should reinforce the managerial 
organs of state assets at municipal and district-county levels; 
explore rational form and ways for the management and business 
of state assets; and ensure the state assets to increase their 
value and the right and interest of state assets not to be 
infringed. While promoting the development of the state and 
collective economies, we should encourage the development of 
enterprises run by individuals, private units, and foreign 
firms; and enhance the management over them in line with the law. 
  Second, we should regard as an emphasis the fostering of 
markets for major factors of production and accelerate the 
establishment of market systems. While continuously improving 
the markets of consumer goods in various categories, an emphasis 
should be placed on developing a large number of large wholesale 
markets with multiple functions and comprehensive character. 
Efforts should be continuously made to develop or improve 
financial markets that are chiefly in charge of raising funds 
and to enliven the channels of fund raising. We should 
establish markets for the transaction of property rights to 
promote the circulation and value increase of capital. Efforts 
should be made to further perfect the markets of real estate and 
to strictly conduct management over them to ensure the profits 
of state land. We should broaden or improve the labor force 
markets and perfect the service systems for job seekers. We 
should also arrange to establish central markets with multiple 
functions for technical talks and standardized information 
markets. Efforts should be made to actively and adequately 
conduct the pilot work for establishing the markets of futures 
and to vigorously develop intermediate organizations for various 
markets. We should perfect the market regulations and rules, 
maintain the market order, strictly standardize and supervise 
marketing acts, oppose to abnormal competitions, resolutely 
punish in line with the law the production and sale of fake and 
substandard-quality products, and protect the legal rights and 
interest of producers and consumers. 
  Third, we should actively promote the reform of the 
departments in charge of overall economic management and 
establish and improve more rapidly the system for overall 
economic regulation and control. In-depth reform of the tax 
system should be conducted in a down-to-earth manner. On the 
premise that the vested interests of districts and counties are 
not affected, the municipality will apply the revenue-sharing 
system to districts and counties, levy taxes according to the 
new tax system, making accounts according to the old system, and 
do a good job in the coordination between the new system for the 
distribution of state-owned enterprises' profits and the 
original contract system. Enterprises which ask to continue the 
agreements on their respective methods for reform may continue 
to implement the agreements until 1995 after obtaining approval 
by the municipal government. Regarding the government-approved 
tax reduction or exemption projects or enterprises enjoying tax 
reduction or exemption whose reduction or exemption term has not 
expired, they should be reexamined and affirmed by relevant 
state departments according to regulations, and the method of 
"levying taxes first and then refunding the taxes" should be 
applied to them. We should actively support the separation 
between the policy lending and commercial lending of banks and 
steadily promote the transformation of specialized banks into 
commercial banks. We should greatly develop local banking 
insurance business and establish the Beijing Development Bank, 
the Merchants Bank, urban cooperative banks, rural cooperative 
banks, and, after State Council approval, two or three joint 
venture banks and foreign-funded banks. We should establish the 
Beijing securities exchange center as soon as possible and 
strive for opening of a few local securities companies. We 
should clarify the major investors and corresponding scope of 
investment, standardize the investment activities, and explore 
the new investment and lending methods. We should strengthen 
the overall regulation and control over the economy. The 
focuses are as follows. 1) The regulation and control over 
funds. We should resolutely implement the State Council 
regulations on strictly controlling the scope of fixed asset 
investment, strive to make the investment pattern more rational, 
and concentrate financial resources on key construction 
projects. 2) The regulation and control over the market. We 
should improve as soon as possible the reserve and regulatory 
systems for the important commodities that have a bearing on the 
national economy and people's livelihood and the special risk 
fund, enhance the government's capacity and means to regulate 
and control market prices, and ensure the thrivingness and 
relative stability of the market. Meanwhile, we should 
strengthen the statistic, monitoring, forecast, and warning 
systems for the economic operation of the entire municipality 
and gain the initiative in the regulation and control. 
  Fourth, we should accelerate the reform of government 
organizations and realistically change the functions of the 
government. We should follow the principle of separating 
government functions from business management and the principle 
of simplifying structures and promoting unity and efficiency to 
do a good job in defining the government functions, number, and 
size, step up the work to dismiss temporary personnel and those 
on loan and disband temporary and overlapping organizations, and 
complete the reform of the municipal-level government 
organizations within this year. Meanwhile, we should do a good 
job in the reform of county-level organizations. Through the 
reform, governments at all levels should promote the 
transformation of their own functions, improve their work 
styles, and raise their work efficiency. In the management of 
economic work, in particular, we should devolve to enterprises 
the work within the scope of their autonomy and to the market 
the issues that should be handled by the market and give full 
play to the role of trade associations, chambers of commerce, 
and other intermediary organizations of the market so that the 
government can truly shift its work focus to macroeconomic 
regulation and control, overall coordination, and social 
administration. We should intensify the training of government 
personnel at all levels and continue the good job in the 
transition to the state public service system. 
  Fifth, we should greatly promote the social security system. 
We should improve the methods for the calculation and 
distribution of basic pension, establish the mechanism for the 
normal increase of retirement pay, and gradually implement the 
socialized management of retire staff members and workers. We 
should earnestly summarize and disseminate in a timely manner 
the experiences of Xicheng District, continue to improve the 
free medical care and the reform of the labor insurance and 
medical administrative system, and promote the experiment with 
the overall planning for the medical fees for the serious 
diseases of enterprise staff and workers and with the special 
account of the medical funds of individual staff and workers. 
We should improve the unemployment insurance system, institute 
the system more extensively, fix a minimum wage requirement, 
ensure the basic life of the personnel who lose their jobs, and 
conduct various forms of employment training to provide 
favorable conditions for their reemployment. We should 
strengthen the collection and management of social insurance 
funds and explore the ways to maintain and increase their value. 
We should continue the reform and development of social 
welfare, social relief, special care to disabled servicemen and 
family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, rural 
old-age insurance, and other social security undertakings. 
  F. We should positively use foreign capital and further 
expand the scale of opening to the outside world. 
  Using foreign capital should continuously be regarded as the 
most important issue of opening to the outside world. New 
breakthroughs should be made in the foreign investment scales, 
spheres, and forms. Foreign businessmen should be guided to 
concentrate their investment on transforming old plants, 
developing the tertiary industry, building urban infrastructural 
facilities, and developing the well-being project. We should 
positively adopt various forms conforming to the international 
practice to attract multinational companies to build and 
cooperatively manage large-sized key projects. We should 
ceaselessly improve the investment environment, accelerate the 
planning and establishment of the modernized port system of the 
capital, and firmly attend to opening the railway and highway 
ports with conditions to the outside world. The investment 
examination and approval procedures should be simplified, a 
treasury of projects which are prepared for foreign investors' 
selections should be established, the local economic regulations 
on the economy involving foreign nationals should be perfected 
in a timely manner, and the management of three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises should be strengthened according to 
laws so as to increase the amounts of capital introduced, the 
business opening rate, and the economic results. We should 
positively strive for and also well use foreign loans and 
continue to do a good job in introducing technologies, skilled 
persons, and managerial work. 
  It is necessary to steadily promote the construction of 
various categories of development zones and small industrial 
zones. The Beijing economic and technological development zone 
should emulate the successful experiences gained by brotherly 
provinces and municipalities; set up a completely new 
high-efficient operational and managerial mechanism that 
conforms to the international practice; concentrate human, 
material, and financial resources to achieve the short-term 
construction and the long-term planning; and form appropriate 
scales as soon as possible. The new-tech industrial development 
experimental zone should continue to deepen the reform of the 
managerial system, bring into play the advantages of scientific 
and technological industries, pioneer channels for movement of 
capital, improve the investment structure, and accelerate the 
pace of industrialization and internationalization. The small 
industrial zones of districts and counties should positively 
assimilate foreign capital and domestic capital and step up 
development and construction on a large scale. 
  We should firmly attend to the reform of the foreign trade 
system and continue to expand foreign economic relations and 
trade. A foreign trade operational mechanism and a foreign 
trade managerial mechanism that suit the general rules for 
international economy should be set up as soon as possible. We 
should set up the Beijing import and export credit and 
investment company, organize and set up an organization for 
management of state-owned assets of economic and trade 
departments, and set up a foreign trade development fund so as 
to expand foreign economic relations and trade. We should 
continue to delegate the right to management of imports and 
exports to the enterprises with conditions, widely open domestic 
goods resources channels, widen the international market, 
increase the proportion of advantageous commodities and 
machinery and electronics commodities in the total export 
commodities, and ensure that the annual export value should 
reach $1.83 billion. We should vigorously develop the tourist 
trade, the foreign service trade, and the export of technologies 
and laborers, and form a new pattern of gaining foreign exchange 
from all-round development of both trade and nontrade. We 
should continue to run overseas enterprises; develop a group of 
internationalized, industrialized, and institutionalized trading 
companies. Coastal and border areas as well as the areas along 
the rivers are encouraged to develop nongovernmental trade 
activities. 
  We should positively expand friendly contacts with foreign 
countries and establish, step by step, friendly contacts with 
the capitals and large cities of increasingly more foreign 
countries. The Sixth Far East and South Pacific Sports Meet for 
the Handicapped will be held in Beijing this September. The 
Fourth World Women's Congress will be held in Beijing in 
September 1995. These are two international grand meetings that 
can produce great impact. Time is pressing, and the tasks are 
heavy. From now on, we must pay high attention to them, 
carefully make preparations, and ensure the successful 
convocation of these meetings. 
  G. We should persistently carry forward democracy, 
administer 
the municipality strictly according to laws, and further 
strengthen the construction of the socialist democracy and the 
legal system. 
  The construction of the socialist democratic politics is one 
of the basic contents of the socialist modernization. We must 
wholeheartedly rely on the working class and the broad masses of 
the people, fully carry forward democracy, and perfect a system 
of making policy decisions more democratic and scientific. The 
capital's major policy decisions on modernization and reform 
should be made by extensively listening to the masses' opinions 
and consciously accepting the supervisions by the people's 
congresses, their standing committees, the people's deputies, 
and the broad masses of the people. 
  We should further 
widen the channels for having CPPCC members, democratic party 
members, and nonparty personages to participate in and discuss 
political affairs; and report important situations in a timely 
manner. We should pay full attention to trade union 
organizations, Communist Youth League organizations, women's 
federations, some other mass organizations, and especially 
invited persons' role as a bridge and a link; bring into play 
the supervisory functions of the mass media; and clear and widen 
the channels for linking the governments with the masses. We 
should continue to perfect the system of soliciting the people's 
opinions and persist in the system of holding seasonal forums 
attended by science professionals, technicians, and specialists. 
We should do a good job in receiving visitors, handling 
incoming letters from the masses, and answering phone calls to 
the mayor; strengthen the construction of grass-roots political 
power; and perfect the enterprise democratic management system 
and the urbanite and villager autonomous system. We should 
bring into full play the positions and roles of the neighborhood 
committees and villagers committees in building the grass-roots 
democracy and realistically safeguard the people's democratic 
rights to managing national, economic, and social affairs 
according to laws. We should comprehensively implement the 
party's policies toward nationalities, deeply launch the 
campaign of unity among various nationalities and national 
progress, and promote economic and cultural development of the 
streets and villages inhabited by the minority nationalities. We 
should further implement the policies on religions and unite 
with and guide the personages of the religious circles to 
contribute to the construction of the capital. We should fully 
understand the importance of Overseas Chinese affairs and the 
work toward Taiwan and bring into full play the peculiar 
advantages of these departments as well as the broad masses of 
Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots' 
irreplaceable functions for doing the work in the political, 
economic, and cultural spheres and for establishing contacts 
with foreign countries. 
  There must be perfect systems to standardize and safeguard 
the setup and perfection of the socialist market economic 
system. We should sum up and popularize the good examples and 
experiences in administering municipal affairs according to laws 
and upgrading the level of administering municipal affairs 
according to laws. It is necessary to accelerate the pace of 
administrative legislation. This year, 18 draft rules and 
regulations are planned to be submitted to the municipal 
people's congress for examinations. The rules and regulations 
that are not suitable to the requirements for the socialist 
market economy should comprehensively be sorted out. The 
enforcement of administrative laws and the supervision over the 
enforcement of laws should be strengthened and improved. The 
governments at various levels should do administrative affairs 
and handle affairs according to laws and resolutely correct the 
phenomena of not observing laws, not strictly enforcing laws, 
and not investigating law-breakers. We should set up and 
develop law service organizations and cultivate a large number 
of qualified persons with knowledge of laws. We should 
strengthen the management of law enforcers and upgrade their 
quality. We should continue to expand the trial implementation 
of the system that people's policemen go the rounds to inspect 
the enforcement of laws. We should adopt various forms to 
strengthen the propaganda and education on the legal system, 
popularize the general knowledge of laws, and enhance the 
citizens' awareness of laws. 
  H. We should persist in the policy on taking a two-hand 
approach and being sure that both hands are tough and vigorously 
strengthen the construction of the socialist spiritual 
civilization. 
  To build the first-class socialist modernized international 
city, we must have not only a high degree of material 
civilization but also a high degree of spiritual civilization. 
The focal point of the spiritual civilization is to arm the 
leaders at various levels and the people of various 
nationalities in the municipality with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to 
mobilize the broad masses of the people's enthusiasm for 
fighting for the realization of the grand goal of socialist 
modernization. In line with the 45th anniversary of the 
founding of the PRC, we should deeply conduct the education on 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism and educate new persons 
with ideals, education, morality, and a sense of discipline. We 
should hold high the main melody of socialism and persist in an 
accurate mass media orientation. In the course of setting up 
the socialist market economic system, we should lay particular 
stress on ideals, discipline, unity, and the overall situation. 
We should positively guide the broad masses of the people in 
the municipality, particularly the youngsters, to foster an 
accurate outlook on life and value and to oppose money worship, 
out-and-out egoism, and corrosive ways of life. We should 
further enhance the "awareness of the capital;" and unswervingly 
launch the activities of "learning from Lei Feng and fostering 
new practices," "of creating civilized cities, building 
civilized units, and being civilized citizens," and of assessing 
and selecting good citizens emerging from being ready to take up 
the cudgels for a just cause." The leading organs and leading 
cadres at various levels should positively organize forces and 
be the first to participate in social welfare activities. It is 
necessary to vigorously commend heroes, model figures, and the 
lofty ideas and heroic activities of learning from Xu Honggang. 
We should strengthen the education on social morality and 
professional ethics and strive to form good social practices of 
being patriotic, respecting jobs, diligently engaging in study, 
being united and friendly, being happy by helping the people, 
supporting the people in danger and with difficulties, being 
ready to take up the cudgels for a just cause, respecting the 
old, and cherishing the young. 
  We should conduct 
double-support work in a down-to-earth manner, promote unity 
between the Army and the government and between the Army and the 
people, and continue to strengthen national defense education 
and militia reserve-duty work. In the activities on building 
civilized residential areas, we should give priorities to 
improving the living environment, perfect the social service, 
and maintain a stable and good social order and a clean and 
beautiful living environment. 
  I. We should resolutely safeguard a political and social 
stability in the capital. 
  Stability is the guarantee for smoothly carrying out reform 
and the modernization drive. Without stability, we will have no 
way of doing anything, and economic development as well as 
improvement in the people's living will vanish like soap 
bubbles. Stability in the capital is particularly important 
because it directly affects the whole country. We must 
safeguard stability in the capital as we cherish our own eyes, 
and must grasp stability as a task of prime importance during 
this year. 
  This year the reform strength is big and the development 
tasks are heavy. Under the situation in which the relations of 
interests and the patterns are being changed, all sorts of new 
contradictions will emerge. We must pay full attention to this. 
Before the issuance of all major reform and development 
measures, we must make good preparations, estimate the problems 
that may possibly occur, give play to the advantages of 
ideological and political work, properly handle contradictions, 
and prevent them from becoming more acute. 
  We should also recognize that the hostile forces and 
elements 
inside and outside the territory are still awaiting chances to 
launch subversive and sabotage activities. We must never lower 
our guard on this. We must carefully guard against this, 
resolutely punish them strictly in line with law when 
discovered, never be soft-handed, eliminate all hidden perils 
during the budding stage, and never allow them to wantonly 
create troubles. 
  The public security problem is also a problem which the 
masses of people are universally concerned about. We should 
mobilize forces from all sectors and actively strengthen the 
comprehensive management of public security. It is necessary to 
uphold the principle of "regarding lookout on public security as 
the mainstay, dealing blows to specific cases as the priorities, 
and give simultaneous attention to attack and prevention and to 
both radical and stopgap measures," strictly implement the 
system of responsibility for comprehensive public security 
management, deal strict blows to all sorts of serious criminal 
crimes and economic criminal activities, resolutely eliminate 
all sorts of social repulsive phenomena, and strictly punish 
criminal elements in line with law. At present, special efforts 
should be made to intensify management over the inflow of 
transients and at the juncture of cities and towns, and further 
enhance the people's sense of safety. It is necessary to 
strengthen the building of public security, judicial and other 
administrative law enforcing contingents, replenish their 
strength, improve equipment, strengthen political and 
professional training, and unceasingly enhance the law enforcing 
capacity and level. 
  J. We should deeply conduct the anticorruption struggle and 
realistically strengthen administrative honesty and diligence. 
  The anticorruption struggle is a major matter affecting the 
success or failure of reform and development and determining the 
rise and fall of the party and the country. Although we 
achieved the expected results last year, it is impossible to 
radically eliminate the soil and conditions for breeding and 
spreading corrupt phenomena within a short period of time. We 
must fully understand the urgency, arduousness, complexity, and 
protractedness of the anticorruption struggle, uphold the 
principle of "first, be resolute, second, be enduring, and 
third, achieve expected results," and deeply and continuously 
conduct anticorruption in line with the central plans. 
  This year the priority of anticorruption is to make 
continued 
efforts to conscientiously implement the three tasks proposed by 
the central authorities. First, leading cadres at and above the 
section level must act strictly in accordance with five 
stipulations proposed by the central authorities last year and 
the new five stipulations put forward this year, conscientiously 
conduct self examination and self correction, give priorities to 
solving problems emerged in merging enterprises, buying and 
selling stock, buying and borrowing cars in violation of 
stipulations, and using public funds to furnish one's own houses 
above the set standards, and strictly implement these 
stipulations in our future work and living. Second, we should 
concentrate efforts on investigating and handling major and 
appalling cases with emphasis on investigating and handling 
cases involving leading cadres who engage in corruption and 
bribery and abuse their powers to seek personal gain, cases 
involving law and discipline enforcing personnel who act wrongly 
out of personal consideration, engage in malpractices, take 
bribes, and bend the law, and cases on law and discipline 
violations involving the legal entities. 
  Once a case is 
discovered, it should be investigated and dealt with immediately 
without any tolerance. All departments and units should be 
forbidden to interfere with the investigation and punishment to 
major and appalling cases. Those who intercede for somebody 
else should be seriously criticized and educated, and those who 
shield criminals should be resolutely punished. All levels of 
governments should guarantee the investigation of and the 
punishment to criminal cases in manpower, material resources, 
and expenses. Third, correction of unhealthy trends of trades 
should be strengthened. The charges already announced to be 
abolished should be abolished resolutely, and on no account 
should these charges be restored secretly. The system of 
"imposing supervision card over exaction of charges" should be 
tried out, and the regulation of separating the exaction of 
administrative fees from the revenues of fines should be carried 
out. Pertinent departments of the municipality should strictly 
examine and approve functionaries' official trips to foreign 
counties and regions, and the trips that are proven unnecessary 
should all be banned. The unhealthy trends bitterly complained 
by the masses, such as abusing one's power to seek personal 
gain, extorting money from masses, pocketing a portion of 
masses' benefits, and utilizing one's power, post, and monopoly 
position to force the masses to buy or sell something and to 
collect fees from the masses, that are committed by a small 
number of persons of law enforcement departments, supervisory 
departments, managerial departments, and public service 
departments, should be regarded as the major targets of the 
anticorruption campaign and efforts should be made to achieve 
practical results. 
  The anticorruption campaign should be subject to the policy 
of opposing and correcting simultaneously, opposing and building 
simultaneously, and paying equal attention to root cause and 
signs. In-depth research should be made for the source and soil 
that may give rise to corruption. Efforts should be made to 
perfect systems and regulations and to strengthen supervision in 
order to gradually establish the mechanism that can prevent 
corrupt phenomena from emerging and spreading. At the same 
time, we should depend on the masses to check corruption and 
combine the masses' reports with the investigation and handling 
of special organs. Those who report on corruption cases should 
be protected, and those who make contributions to reporting on 
corruption cases should be commended and awarded. The role of 
democratic parties and non-party figures should be brought into 
full play. These parties and figures should be organized to 
participate in the anticorruption campaign, and their opinions 
and suggestions should be heard conscientiously. Law and 
discipline enforcement departments, such as judicial, auditing, 
and supervisory departments, should report anticorruption 
situation to the masses in a time manner and should voluntarily 
subject themselves to the supervision by the masses. Typical 
cases should be made public to educate cadres and the masses. 
  Administrative honesty should be closely combined with 
administrative diligence. Wholeheartedly serving the people is 
the fundamental purpose of the government work, and honestly 
performing official duties and diligently serving the people are 
the most fundamental demands on all state functionaries as well 
as the code of conduct that all state functionaries must 
observe. While developing the socialist market economy, we 
should on no account introduce the principle of commodity 
exchange to the political affairs activities of state organs and 
should not strike a deal between power and money. At the same 
time, we should not tolerate such behaviors as being indifferent 
to the masses, being irresponsible for work, being dilatory in 
doing things, and shifting responsibility onto others. All the 
dereliction of duties by state functionaries should be 
investigated and held into account. To improve work style and 
work efficiency, working personnel of governments at all levels, 
leading cadres in particular, should strive to study more, 
engage in fewer social intercourse, look into real situation, 
engage in tangible deeds, tell the truth, guard against boasting 
and exaggeration, stress on quality and efficiency, take the 
overall situation into account, observe discipline, and 
conscientiously fulfill duties. The vast numbers of the masses 
bitterly hate corrupt phenomena. They are concerned with and 
take an active part in the anticorruption campaign, thus 
manifesting their great trust and ardent expectation on the 
people's government. We should never let the vast numbers of the 
masses down by profoundly and persistently carrying the 
anticorruption campaign through to the end without any deviation. 
  Fellow deputies: Tasks for 1994 are very heavy. To 
fulfill the target of this year, we must further emancipate our 
minds; break the fetter of ossified and out-dated concepts by 
closely following the center of economic construction; 
resolutely overcome the blindness, complacency, and passiveness; 
boldly engage in exploration; and bravely create something new. 
Current conditions both at home and abroad are very favorable, 
therefore, we must firmly size the precious historical 
opportunity by displaying the spirit of racing against time and 
concentrate our efforts on wholeheartedly and successfully 
conducting economic construction so as to strive to achieve 
faster and better development. 
  Investigation and study represent the basic work undertaken 
by governments, the basic quality possessed by leading cadres, 
and the bridge that links the theory with the reality. Only by 
deeply carrying out investigation and study can we deeply 
understand the conditions of the municipality and the country; 
grasp the general and special laws of developing various 
undertakings; foster the scientific spirit of seeking truth; 
truly grasp the right of voicing opinions, exercising 
leadership, and making policy decisions in the government work; 
seize the major contradiction and crucial link that exert 
decisive influence on the whole situation; and concentrate our 
efforts on making breakthrough in key projects to push forward 
the overall development of work in various fields. The people 
will not be satisfied with the vague generalization and the 
unchanged style of things. We should regard the hot problems 
for which the masses have shown great concerns and the difficult 
problems cropping up in the work as an emphasis of investigation 
and study and formulate plans for implementing the investigation 
and study work. All leading cadres should define units at 
grass-roots levels for their investigation and study operation; 
learn about their situation frequently; actively help these 
units deal with their problems; and bravely stand on the 
forefront of reform, opening up, and economic construction to 
exercise the leadership over the great change. 
  The deepening of reform and opening up and the development 
of 
modernizations urgently require the working personnel, 
particularly leading cadres, of governments at all levels to 
work hard; to successfully conduct study in a down-to-earth 
manner; and to consciously apply the scientific theory to 
directing the practice. Focal points for the work this year are 
as follows: 1) A good job should be done in studying the third 
volume of "Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works" and in arming 
themselves with the socialist theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to unify our thinking and action. 2) We 
should earnestly study the decision made at the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the important reform 
measures issued by the central authorities, and the basic 
theories and knowledge of socialist market economy. 3) We 
should study the legal knowledge and enhance the sense of laws 
and the capability of handling problems in line with the law. 4) 
We should vigorously grasp the necessary knowledge in science, 
culture, and specialized fields for modernizations. Meanwhile, 
we should uphold the party's mass line; learn from the mass 
modestly; increase our capability in practice; and upgrade our 
quality in an overall way in the fields of theory and culture as 
well as our level in scientific management. The more such 
cadres we have possessed and the more prospects the capital's 
undertakings of modernizations will have. 
  Fellow deputies: The bright future of the capital in reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernizations has unfolded before our 
eyes and urges us to score new achievements. The opportunity in 
this regard is precious, tasks for this regard are heavy, and 
the road of carrying out these tasks is long. Let us follow the 
direction guided by the socialist theory of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and closely rally round the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to open new 
ideas and to create a new situation under the leadership of the 
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee as well as to continuously win a 
new victory in the capital's program of socialist modernizations.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- China is ready to 
enhance economic cooperation with German businessmen, Beijing 
Mayor Li Qiyan said today while meeting with Dr. Hans-Dietrich 
Winkhaus, chief executive officer of Henkel KGAA, a leading 
German manufacturer of chemicals. 
  Li said that the German firm is welcome to invest in 
Beijing, 
especially since Germany is an economically developed country 
and possesses advanced technological know-how. 
  A memorandum has just been signed between the firm and 
Beijing to set up an enterprise, with an investment of eight 
million U.S. dollars from the German side, to produce glue and 
chemicals for civilian construction use. 
  As the world's leading manufacturer of chemicals, the firm's 
volume of business for 1993 reached 13.4 billion U.S. dollars. 
So far it has set up six joint ventures in China's Shanghai, 
Guangzhou and Tianjin cities.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA)--The Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] has sent a letter to 
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] today inviting the 
latter anew to send SEF personnel and related experts to 
Hangzhou to hear briefings by experts handling the Qiandao Lake 
case. 
  The letter says that in accordance with the law, relevant 
departments on the China mainland protect the lives and property 
of Taiwan compatriots touring, visiting relatives, doing 
business, and making investment on the mainland. Regarding 
cases of the lives and property of Taiwan compatriots being 
infringed upon, the mainland authorities will investigate and 
deal with them should they take place, and handle them according 
to the law. The "Qiandao Lake" case has served as an example. 
In principle, ARATS agrees to exchange views with Taiwan's SEF 
on incidents jeopardizing the lives and property of mainland and 
Taiwan compatriots that have occurred now and then in 
cross-strait exchanges and contacts in recent years. In the 
wake of the "Qiandao Lake" incident, compatriots in Taiwan as 
well as on the China mainland have pinned greater hopes on ARATS 
and SEF pushing forward cross-strait relations. We should work 
hard to promote the aforesaid discussion's bearing fruit. For 
this purpose, ARATS has already enthusiastically made 
suggestions on the agenda and contents in exchanging views. 
  The letter says that ARATS has already continuously provided 
SEF with facts regarding the crimes of the culprits and the 
situation at the scene. Regarding the autopsy reports, verbal 
briefings will be given when SEF experts arrive in Hangzhou.

  [Text] Taipei, April 30 (CNA) -- Lawyers, criminology 
experts and relatives of the 24 Taiwan tourists murdered and 
robbed on Qiandao Lake are scheduled to fly to Hangzhou May 8 to 
hear a mainland Chinese briefing on the crime. 
  Yeh Chin-feng, vice chairwoman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council [MAC], said the council agreed to the mainland visit 
only after the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across 
the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) Friday [29 April] notified its Taiwan 
counterpart, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) that 
foundation personnel will be permitted to visit the boat where 
the murders occurred. 
  Victims' relatives were barred from boarding the pleasure 
boat when they were in the mainland earlier this month, a move 
which was seen as an attempt by the mainland to cover up details 
of the crime. 
  Yeh quoted ARATS as saying that SEF personnel will also be 
given an oral report on autopsies performed after the crime, 
apparently a compromise to Taiwan's demand for a written report. 
  The group will include law and crime experts, Yeh said, but 
she declined to say whether active-duty police officers will be 
part of the entourage. 
  Mainland authorities have arrested three suspects in the 
murders but failed to clear up some remaining questions 
surrounding the case. 
  SEF and ARATS are authorized by their respective governments 
to handle private exchanges in the absence of official contacts.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chen Huanyou, provincial party committee </F>
secretary and governor of Jiangsu, recorded and sorted by 
special correspondent Chou Yeh 0719 6851]; place and date not 
given; first three paragraphs are CHUNG KUO SHIH PAO 
introduction] 
  [Text] Today we publish a special issue on Jiangsu, the 
eighth stop on our mainland reporting tour. Our ad hoc 
reporting team, wishing to give an in-depth report on Jiangsu's 
present situation, went across the entire province and carried 
out a month-long investigation and news gathering, contributing 
to the making of this special issue. This special issue is 
divided into six main sections, giving reports on such special 
topics as Taiwan-Jiangsu relations, local economies across 
Jiangsu, village and town enterprises, society and culture, as 
well as tourism and consumption. 
  In addition, Shen Ta-jen [Shen Daren] and Chen Huan-yu [Chen 
Huanyou], respectively former and incumbent secretary of the 
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, gave separate exclusive 
interviews to our editor-in-chief Huang Chao-sung [7806 5128 
2646] and reporters Yu Yu-lin [0205 7183 7207], Pai Te-hua [4101 
1795 5478], and Chou Yeh. During the interviews, both Shen 
Ta-jen and Chen Huan-yu answered in detail questions raised by 
our reporting team. 
  During his exclusive interview with our reporting team, 
Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Secretary Chen Huan-yu 
pointed out: Although we do not have too many exchanges with 
Taiwan, Jiangsu will take a positive attitude toward exchanges 
across the Taiwan Strait and will try its best to help realize 
any plans favorable to cross-strait exchanges. Furthermore, 
Jiangsu will start a tuition class for the Taiwan Joint College 
Entrance Examination and pre-university courses for Taiwan 
students. The contents of Chen Huan-yu's interview with CHUNG 
KUO SHIH PAO [CKSP] are as follows: 
  [CKSP] Last year Jiangsu Province put up an economic 
performance that was outstanding among various provinces on the 
mainland. Mr. Secretary, would you please tell us the main 
reasons behind the Jiangsu economy's relatively outstanding 
performance? 
  [Chen] Outside people's affirmation of the noticeable 
results in Jiangsu's economic development last year is an 
encouragement for us. Encouragement from Taiwan in particular 
gave us a deep impression. On behalf of compatriots in the 
province, I express gratitude for this. We were able to score 
such results last year because of good opportunities, favorable 
geographical position, and, still more, the positive effect of 
human factors. 
  We may call 1993 a year in which our provincial economy 
enjoyed sustained development. While the total annual output of 
goods and services for the province topped 255 billion renminbi 
yuan, up 18.5 percent over the previous year and topping up the 
second doubling in its value seven years ahead of schedule; the 
per capita gross national product for the province rose to 3,675 
yuan, or 1,000 yuan more than the national average. 
  [CKSP] You assumed the position of secretary at the end of 
last September while holding the governorship at the same time. 
As the new secretary, would you please tell us about your 
latest overall vision of the direction for Jiangsu's economic 
development and where the principal focuses of development lie? 
<H5>  Implementation of Macroeconomic Regulation and Control is </H5>
Favorable to Economic Transformation 
  [Chen] We have determined two main objectives of struggle 
for Jiangsu's economic development: First, the objective of 
reform is to establish in about five years a basic framework for 
the socialist market economic system. Second, the objective of 
development is to double the province's total annual output of 
goods and services for the third time by the end of the century 
following the realization of the second "doubling" ahead of time 
in 1993, so as to lift the economy's overall quality and 
composite strength to a new level and bring about a relatively 
comfortable life for the people ahead of schedule. 
  As to the question of where the principal focuses of future 
development lie, I would condense my answer into four phrases: 
seize the opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider to the 
outside world, and accelerate development. So these will be our 
focus of development. 
  As the state has introduced a few more major reform 
measures this year, our present task is to properly conduct 
propaganda, give explanations, and carry out organization, 
coordination, dovetailing, and implementation of measures. We 
should manage to carry out thorough preparation and meticulous 
organization to ensure success. It is necessary to advance 
opening up to the outside world at an even higher level to 
vigorously develop an open economy. We will make full use of 
the international market and foreign capital, technology, and 
resources; expand import and export trading, attract foreign 
capital from a high starting point and on a large scale, 
converge and merge with the international economy in an even 
faster and better way, and accelerate the process of building a 
new system of socialist market economy. In addition, we will 
strive for speed as far as possible based on the viewpoint that 
"development is the last word." So long as we have quality, 
good sales, efficiency, and basically satisfactory supplies of 
essential production factors, we will embark on as many projects 
as possible. Our general policy is: "The fast are not to be 
halted by force and the slow are not to be rushed by force 
either." 
  [CKSP] As you are the first person in Jiangsu to hold dual 
positions [provincial party secretary and governor], we would 
like to know whether you have trouble trying to cope with the 
workload of managing both party and government affairs? 
  [Chen] I am now concurrently holding two positions on a 
temporary basis under special circumstances, and this will not 
last long. I have two ways to suit myself to the dual 
positions: one is to rely on collectives -- our leading 
collectives; the other is to rely on the masses. An individual 
has very little strength and is unable to get things done all by 
himself. I rely on the collectives. I give the ideas, they 
carry them out, and the masses implement them. So things are 
easily accomplished in this way. 
  [CKSP] I am sorry to chip in. You said you are holding dual 
positions on a temporary basis, but Hainan's Juan Chung-wu [Ruan 
Chongwu] has held dual positions for a long time while several 
other provinces, such as Fujian, followed suit recently. Can 
all these be viewed as temporary? 
  [Chen] I am not too sure about explanations given by other 
provinces, but as far as I know, that was meant to be a 
temporary measure in Fujian also. As for us, it really is a 
temporary measure. Juan Chung-wu's holding dual positions is a 
procedural matter, on which the central authorities have taken a 
clear stand. Being a small province with a population of only a 
few million and with economic development at the initial stage, 
Hainan is suitable for a little experimentation. As we, 
Jiangsu, are a big province with a population of 70 million and 
economic development ranking among the top in the country, I 
would be able to cope with the heavy workload alone only 
temporarily but not in the long run. The central authorities 
have also made this clear. 
  While some people say it is easier to get things done with 
concentrated authority, this has to be viewed in two respects: 
advantage and disadvantage. The advantage is swift handling of 
matters, while the disadvantage is a lack of restriction which 
raises the possibility of making mistakes. Things will go wrong 
in the long run when a person has to make policy decisions as 
well as carry them out all by himself; this just does not work. 
Therefore, my holding dual positions at the moment is only a 
temporary measure and not a matter of regular practice. From 
the standpoint of regular practice, it is better to separate the 
two positions. We had all the while separated party and 
government affairs, with major strategies being decided by the 
party committee and daily work and specific matters organized 
and implemented by the government. Outside people misread it as 
our current move toward combining party and government affairs; 
this is a misunderstanding. 
  [CKSP] We all know the Central Committee of the Chinese 
Communists are now implementing measures for macroeconomic 
regulation and control and tightening finances. Is Jiangsu 
fully prepared for this policy and have you taken any 
corresponding measures such as reducing the scale of investment 
and tightening credits? Furthermore, what impact does this 
policy have on the economic development strategies formulated by 
Jiangsu? 
  [Chen] The CPC Central Committee's measures drawn up last 
year to strengthen and improve microeconomic regulation and 
control played a very important role in overall economic 
development and social stability. However, we have to admit 
that these measures somewhat affected the pace of Jiangsu's 
economic development in the short run. Nevertheless, there are 
pros and cons to everything. With a smaller budget, we made 
careful plans, concentrated funds, and spent money on more 
important projects such as the renovation of the Nanjing Airport 
and the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway. Those small-sized 
infrastructure projects had to be suspended temporarily. If we 
took a passive attitude toward microeconomic regulation and 
control, we would have only noticed problems like the tight 
money supply, fund shortages, and a strained microeconomic 
environment. But in the long run, microeconomic regulation and 
control is helpful for quickening economic development and 
carrying out our economic development strategy. 
  For example, village and town enterprises developed very 
fast 
in the past few years. The pace of development among them was 
uneven. Some of them wanted to continue expanding their scale of 
production without taking their poor quality of development into 
consideration. Now they have slowed down somewhat and found out 
about their mistakes. This enabled some small-sized plants to 
merge into large- sized factories. With more funds, these 
factories are, instead of manufacturing poor-quality products, 
producing high-quality products that generate greater economic 
efficiency. This might not be a bad thing. That is why I 
stressed that we have to understand microeconomic regulation and 
control with a positive approach. 
  When the CPC Central Committee just began to carry out 
microeconomic regulation and control measures last year, we 
encountered the problem of fund shortages. The provincial party 
committee urged the entire province to economize as much as 
possible to save money not allocated for normal expenditures. 
The goal was to save 10 billion yuan by year's end. In only 
two months, we accomplished our mission of saving 10 billion 
yuan and resolved the fund shortage problem. We can see from 
this example that as long as the people support us, we will 
easily get things done. 
<H5>  Village and Town Enterprises in South Jiangsu Are Required </H5>
To Improve Their Quality 
  [CKSP] Village and town enterprises in Jiangsu developed 
vigorously in recent years. Nevertheless, there are limits to 
the development of village and town enterprises, most of which 
are small- and medium-sized. Will Jiangsu consider expanding 
village and town enterprises in terms of their sizes? Moreover, 
does Jiangsu have a new development strategy for current and 
future village and town enterprises? 
  [Chen] The flourishing of village and town enterprises is a 
special feature in Jiangsu's economic development, and such 
enterprises are the pillars of Jiangsu's economy. Especially 
since the 1980's, village and town enterprises in south Jiangsu 
have entered a new stage of development. We can sum up the 
following special features shared by the village and town 
enterprises in south Jiangsu: Enterprises' scales of operation 
became larger, domestically-made equipment was replaced by 
foreign-made supplies, product quality was improved, more 
investment channels were opened, more markets for products were 
found, and a better investment environment was created. These 
features indicated the development of village and town 
enterprises in south Jiangsu has entered the stage of quality 
improvement. Those traditional enterprises began to change 
themselves into modern industrial enterprises. 
  At present, Jiangsu's village and town enterprises are 
indeed 
faced with such problems as fund shortages, insufficient 
markets, widening disparities between different regions, poor 
economic efficiency, and lack of specially-trained personnel. 
These problems are actually problems emerging naturally in the 
development of village and town enterprises. With clear goals, 
correct guidance, and solid work, we believe we will help 
village and town enterprises seize opportunities, overcome 
difficulties, and develop in a healthy manner. 
<H5>  Jiangsu Strives To Shorten Disparity Between the South and </H5>
the North 
  [CKSP] As the provincial economies developed in the 
mainland, many provinces saw uneven development among various 
regions. Jiangsu seemed to have the same sort of problem -- the 
uneven development between the south and the north. Would you 
please tell us if you have any measures to shorten the disparity 
between the two regions? 
  [Chen] The problem of uneven economic development between 
south and north Jiangsu does exist. Being restricted by certain 
conditions, economic development in south Jiangsu is faster than 
that of the north. We always attach importance to this problem. 
We hold that the disparity was hard to avoid. However, we 
cannot afford a great disparity in peoples' living standards. 
Things will eventually go wrong if the disparity among peoples' 
living standards becomes wider and wider. The second session of 
the eighth provincial people's congress which recently ended put 
forward the important task of bringing various regions' strong 
points into full play to promote the economic development of the 
entire province. To resolve the problem, the provincial 
government drew up the following four [figure as published] 
measures: 
  1. We are making efforts to assist northern Jiangsu in the 
construction of infrastructure projects, such as installing 
telephones and building electric power plants and roads. We 
first borrowed $170,000 [figure as published] from Sweden to 
solve the problem of inadequate telephone service in northern 
Jiangsu. Now the problem of telephone service at the county 
level and above in northern Jiangsu has been totally solved. 
Then we helped northern Jiangsu build electric power plants. 
Xuzhou had power plants with a total capacity of more than 1 
million kw, and now we have built plants with an additional 
capacity of several hundred thousand kw. We also built electric 
power plants in Huaiyin, Yancheng, and Lianyungang. Although 
there are still some locales which have not solved the problem 
of electricity, we are determined to solve the problem within 
three years. The next is road construction. Now we are 
building highways between Nanjing and Lianyungang, between 
Nanjing and Nantong, between Nantong and Yancheng, and between 
Nantong and Lianyungang. Besides, we are also building some 
railways. 
  2. We are speeding up the structural adjustment of 
agriculture, making efforts to stabilize the production of grain 
and cotton, and vigorously developing diversified farming 
operations in order to improve the rural economy. Although 
Jiangsu has made quite rapid progress in industrial development, 
we have not overlooked agriculture. The total grain output of 
this province is still between 62 to 66 billion jin per annum. 
Jiangsu is different from Guangdong and Fujian. The latter 
provinces plant less grain and attach importance to growing 
bananas, chestnuts, and other cash crops. We cannot do the same 
thing because we have so many people and we must have enough 
rice. 
  3. We have made efforts to establish links between northern 
and southern Jiangsu. We have dispatched cadres from southern 
Jiangsu to work as deputy mayors or deputy county heads in 
northern Jiangsu and let them bring the concepts and experiences 
of southern Jiangsu to northern Jiangsu. Meanwhile, we have 
also transferred some cadres from northern Jiangsu to southern 
Jiangsu to let them learn the motive force of southern Jiangsu. 
In addition, we have encouraged enterprises, sci-tech research 
units, and individuals to visit and exchange experiences in 
various fields with units and people at various levels in 
northern Jiangsu. This is the exchange of personnel. We have 
also promoted the establishment of links between units in 
northern and southern Jiangsu. For example, textile mills in 
southern Jiangsu have established direct links with 
cotton-producing areas in northern Jiangsu to eliminate 
intermediary agencies and increase the income of the rural areas. 
  [CKSP] Businessmen from Taiwan have made many investments in 
Jiangsu. What are the main areas in which they invest? 
Roughly speaking, what is the total amount of their 
investments? What will be the most desirable areas of 
investment by Taiwanese businessmen in the future? What 
preferential treatments do you have? 
  [Chen] In recent years, economic and trade contacts between 
Jiangsu and Taiwan have developed very fast. Taiwanese 
businessmen have made many kinds of investments in this 
province, including light industry, chemicals, textiles, 
electronics, building materials, food products, agriculture, and 
tertiary industries. Judging from the figures of growth of 
Taiwanese businessmen's investments on the mainland, Jiangsu 
ranks first among all provinces. We have a favorable 
geographical position, a relatively good industrial foundation, 
and a favorable investment environment. Besides, the educational 
level in this province is also quite high. Therefore, we hope 
more financial groups and major corporations in Taiwan will make 
investments and set up plants in Jiangsu, and we hope they will 
bring in more new and high technologies, items of greater 
scientific and technological value, and more world renowned 
brands. 
  Moreover, we highly welcome Taiwanese businessmen to make 
investments in transportation, energy sources, communications, 
and the production of raw materials. We are not afraid of 
letting Taiwanese businessmen occupy a larger share of those 
projects. On the contrary, we welcome Taiwanese businessmen to 
increase their proportion of investments. In this connection, 
we have formulated a series of policies to encourage investments 
by businessmen from Taiwan and foreign countries. On a mutually 
beneficial basis, we will protect the lawful rights of investors. 
  Welcome Investments by Taiwanese Businessmen, Expect 
Exchanges With Taiwan 
  [CKSP] There are many people in Taiwan whose native region 
is Jiangsu. What is the general situation regarding their 
relatives in Jiangsu? As far as we know, exchanges of various 
types between Jiangsu and Taiwan are not very frequent. I would 
like to ask: do you have any plan for strengthening exchanges 
between Jiangsu and Taiwan, and if so, how are you going to do 
this? 
  [Chen] Exchange activities between Jiangsu and Taiwan are 
indeed not very frequent. However, generally speaking, some 
progress has been made in developing exchanges between the two 
areas. In 1993, Jiangsu and Taiwan conducted 70 exchange 
activities, involving 657 people. Of these, Taiwan organized 41 
delegations to visit Jiangsu, involving a total of 606 people, 
while this province organized 29 visits involving a total of 51 
people. Jiangsu held exhibitions and demonstrations of Yixing's 
pottery and Suzhou's embroidery in Taiwan. In the future, we 
will continue to maintain a positive attitude toward promoting 
exchanges between the two sides of the Strait. We will do our 
best to promote all beneficial exchanges between the two sides. 
  This year we will hold a continuation class for students 
from 
Taiwan to take part in the joint college entrance examination 
and a preparatory class for regular courses. The Nanjing 
Teachers' University will also accept students from Taiwan 
beginning the next semester. 
  At the invitation of the Kaohsiung Antiques Research 
Society, 
four experts of the Nanjing Museum will visit Taiwan. The 
Yangzhou Puppet Troupe, the Xuzhou Liuqin Theatrical Troupe, and 
the Nanjing Xiaohonghua Art Troupe will all visit Taiwan at an 
appropriate time. 
  As for the relatives of Taiwan compatriots in this province, 
there are more than 520,000 people, according to a statistical 
report. They are working at various posts. 
  [CKSP] Finally, I would like to ask the secretary this 
question. Since relations between Jiangsu and Taiwan have 
become increasingly close in recent years, we wonder about your 
understanding of Taiwan. Through what channels do you know 
about the situation in Taiwan? 
  [Chen] In recent years, in the wake of increasing contacts 
of people between the two sides of the Strait, a large number of 
Taiwan compatriots have come to Jiangsu to visit their 
relatives, to engage in sight-seeing, to conduct investigations 
and make investments, and to carry out other activities. 
Therefore, we have paid good attention to the situation in 
Taiwan. I have met with many Taiwan compatriots who came to 
Jiangsu to conduct investigations and make investments or to 
carry our other activities, including your colleagues in 
journalist circles. They have given me much information about 
the situation in Taiwan. Nowadays, the mass media have 
developed rapidly and there are frequent reports on Taiwan. It 
should not be difficult to understand the situation in Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will lead a delegation to the United 
States next month to attend the second round of tariff talks 
between Taipei and Washington under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework. 
  At the top of the agenda during the May 12-13 talks will be 
the size or Taiwan's tariff cuts, revisions to Taiwan's alcohol 
and tobacco monopoly system, government procurement agreements, 
and the opening of Taiwan's agricultural markets. 
  In addition, sources said that the United States will soon 
submit a list of tariff requests for Taiwan's service industry. 
The U.S. is expected to ask Taiwan to open its transportation, 
telecommunications, banking, stock and futures markets. 
  Economics Ministry officials said they hope the two sides 
will reach an agreement during the talks, which will then 
encourage other countries to hold bilateral tariff talks with 
Taiwan. 
  The successful conclusion of Taipei-Washington talks will 
also facilitate Taiwan's bid to enter the world trade body, the 
officials said. 
  After the first round of talks in Taipei, Taiwan agreed to 
reduce tariffs on some of the 699 farm and industrial products 
on a U.S. list within the near future. Other reductions will 
come later after revisions of related laws and regulations, 
according to the Board of Foreign Trade. 
  Sheu will leave for the United States May 9. After the 
talks, he will travel to Geneva where he will attend the fifth 
meeting of the GATT working party responsible for reviewing 
Taiwan's bid to enter into the world trade body. 
  Sheu is expected to hold tariff talks with Mexico and Canada 
during the meeting. 
  Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992 
and 
hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

Minister Qian Qichen said today that resumption of Chinese 
sovereignty over Hong Kong to protect national interests will be 
conducive to the maintenance of long-term stability and 
prosperity in Hong Kong. 
  Qian made the remark at a meeting with a delegation from the 
Hong Kong Travel Industry Council. 
  No matter what the British side does, the Chinese Government 
will not change its set goal, Qian said. 
  After hearing a briefing from the delegation on the 
development of tourism in Hong Kong, Qian said the mainland 
hopes for a continuing development of the tourism industry in 
Hong Kong while the industry on the mainland should also be 
promoted. A boost of tourism on the mainland will surely help 
promote the prosperity of the industry in Hong Kong, he added. 
  Qian wished the Hong Kong International Tourism Fair, to be 
held next month, success so as to ensure common prosperity in 
tourism in Hong Kong and on the mainland.

  [Text] Beijing, April 30 (XINHUA) -- The Beijing 
Association for Promoting Overseas Friendship has become a 
bridge for increasing exchanges between China's capital and Hong 
Kong, Macao, Taiwan and countries overseas. 
  An association official said that since 1992 his association 
has helped local companies sign six cooperation contracts with 
overseas firms, bringing in 31.5 million U.S. dollars in total 
foreign investment. 
  One cooperation project is the Beijing Dajing 
Telecommunications Cable Company, which will involve a total 
investment of 30 million U.S. dollars, with the overseas 
partners contributing 65 percent. 
  Another cooperation project is a Muslim building in downtown 
Beijing, which will be rebuilt at a cost of 20 U.S. million 
dollars. The Chinese and foreign partners each will contribute 
50 percent of the total investment. 
  The official said that since its establishment six years 
ago, 
his association has received 560,000 U.S. dollars donated by 
residents in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as Overseas 
Chinese and foreigners of Chinese origin. 
  The donations have been used to aid the development of such 
sectors as science, culture and education in Beijing, he added. 
  Since 1992 the association has received 862 visitors from 
Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas, he said. 
  It has established cooperative relations with 26 
associations 
and societies overseas, he said.

  [Text] Jerusalem, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin met with U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher at the Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv this morning and 
discussed the continuation of Israel-Arab peace negotiations 
with focus on Syrian track. 
  Rabin emphasized the importance of secret talks in peace 
talks and criticized Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad for refusing 
to give favorable response. He also blamed Syria for Hezbollah 
attacks in South Lebanon. 
  To start the talks, Rabin and Christopher had a 15-minute 
private meeting and then were jointed by Foreign Minister 
Shim'on Peres, U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East 
Peace Talks Dennis Ross and other senior officials from both 
sides. 
  Rabin said that Syria has made the maximum territorial 
demand, but not given the slightest hint of confidence-building 
measures, which can prove to Israeli public that Syria desires 
for peace. 
  There are two major problems on the way to peace, namely, 
attacks by Hezbollah in Lebanon instigated or tolerated by Syria 
and Palestinian terrorism in the (occupied) territories, Rabin 
said. 
  In the attacks in South Lebanon, Rabin disclosed, Hezbollah 
has deliberately targeted Christian villages, shooting at 
Christian villages, and shooting from inside the villages which 
are not situated in the "security zone." 
  He noted that to allow Hezbollah to open fire from inside 
the 
villages is a violation of the understanding reached between 
Israel and Syria after the "operation of accountability" last 
year because it means that they can use the villagers as a human 
shield against Israeli retaliation. 
  On Syria's refusal to conduct secret talks, Rabin said it is 
difficult to work with someone who says he wants peace but 
refuses to talk face to face. 
  Christopher listened without a comment. But one of the U.S. 
diplomats said America's diplomatic activity is not a substitute 
for direct talks between the parties and this is clear to the 
Syrians. 
  At Rabin's suggestion, the Israeli and U.S. officials split 
into three working groups on Syria, Jordan and Lebanon on 
detailed discussions. 
  Later today, the entire party will reconvene and the working 
groups will report on their deliberations. 
  According to Minister of Environment Yosi Sarid, who 
attended 
the meeting, Rabin did not make any hint that he will propose 
complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights in exchange for full 
peace with Syria at this stage. 
  However, Sarid said, Rabin has declared that he will uproot 
the Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights for the sake of 
peace and that the depth of withdrawal will be according to the 
depth of peace. By combining the two very important statements, 
people can come to their own conclusion.

  [Text] Jerusalem, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Warren Christopher, 
visiting U.S. secretary of state, said he will return to the 
Middle East in two weeks to advance peace talks between Israel 
and Syria. 
  The U.S. secretary of state made the announcement after his 
second round of talks at Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's 
residence here Monday [2 May] night, according to a report of 
Israel radio today. 
  Christopher's decision is apparently based on the assumption 
that progress so far is enough to prompt him to continue his 
efforts to advance talks on Syrian track. 
  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad told Christopher that he is 
ready for "normalization with Israel" at the end of full Israeli 
troops pullout from the Golan Heights. Israel snatched the 
piece of land from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. 
  Christopher relayed the message to Rabin Monday morning. The 
two met again Monday night believably [as received] to exchange 
views on assessment of the situation. 
  Israeli officials say the Syrian proposals have opened a new 
chapter in peace negotiations between Israel and Syria. It 
marked the first time that al-Asad has explicitly said his 
country is willing to normalize ties. 
  "The progress on this Christopher visit to the region is 
that 
Israel spoke about withdrawal, and al-Asad spoke about 
normalization. For the first time, the U.S. feels that this may 
work, and there is enough to begin future bargaining between the 
two sides," a senior Israeli official said. 
  A senior U.S. official concurred privately that "we finally 
have substantive positions on both sides, and they are no longer 
talking slogans. There is serious engagement, but there is a 
long way to go," he said.

Minister Pavel Grachev today proposed creating a collective 
security system in the Asian-Pacific region, saying that a 
special group of experts might be assembled in the near future 
to work out a program. 
  After meeting with his South Korean colleague Yi Pyong-tae

Moscow, Grachev told reporters that they had discussed his 
proposal which would be examined in Seoul. 
  The two ministers also discussed problems concerning the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Meanwhile, 
Grachev expressed his worries over DPRK's nuclear program. 
  Yi Pyong-tae stressed that the military ties between Russia 
and South Korea will serve as confidence and security-building 
measures both between the two countries and on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The two ministers' talks resulted in the signing of two 
accords -- a memorandum on mutual understanding between the two 
countries' defense ministers and a declaration on military 
cooperation between Russia and South Korea. 
  Yi Pyong-tae arrived here on Thursday [28 April] for an 
official visit to Russia.

  [Text] United Nations, April 29 (XINHUA) -- 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today expressed concern at 
the "persistence of the deadlock in the efforts to restore 
democracy in Haiti" as well as the human rights situation in the 
country. 
  Having reviewed the situation with his special 
representative

essential that the restoration of democracy be the result of an 
agreement by the Haitian parties," a U.N. spokesman said today. 
  A draft Security Council resolution on Haiti, worked out by 
the United States and being circulated among diplomats here, 
gives Haitian military authorities 15 days to resign or leave 
the country. Otherwise, they will face much tougher sanctions. 
  According to the Governor's Island treaty signed between 
exile Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Haitian Army 
chief Raoul Cedras last July, the president should have returned 
to his country by the end of the following October. 
  But Aristide cannot do so because the military authorities 
failed to observe the accord they themselves signed. 
  The secretary-general has asked Caputo to "continue to 
analyze the situation closely and to report back to him soon," 
and will report to the General Assembly this week, the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- While meeting with 
Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua at the White House this morning, 
U.S. President Clinton said both the U.S. Government and he 
himself are ready to work with the Chinese to overcome 
differences existing between the two countries so as to enable 
their relations to grow further. 
  President Clinton said that China is a very important and 
great country. Both he and the U.S. Government attach great 
importance to the development of friendly relations with China. 
  He also said: The United States and China should become 
partners of cooperation in their efforts to safeguard world 
peace and promote economic progress. The two countries should 
establish a relationship based on sincerity and mutual respect. 
He noted that "We are willing to take part in China's 
development program." 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said: China always takes a serious, 
positive, and forward-looking approach to Sino-U.S. relations. 
China sees and deals with this relationship from a long-term and 
worldwide perspective. He pointed out: Sino-U.S. relations are 
now at a crucial juncture. There are still differences between 
the two sides on some issues, but their common interests far 
outweigh the differences. It is China's hope that the two sides 
should do more in seeking things in common and expanding their 
common interests [fa zhan gong tong li yi 4099 1455 0364 0681 
0448 4135], end their past disputes as soon as possible, resume 
and increase the exchange and cooperation between them in 
various areas, and open up the way to the future of bilateral 
relations. 
  Zou Jiahua said: Good Sino-U.S. relations are in the 
interest of the people of the two countries, and the people of 
the whole world as well. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua conveyed regards from Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng to President Clinton. 
Clinton expressed thanks for this and asked Zou to convey his 
regards to the Chinese leaders. President Clinton recalled that 
he and President Jiang had a very good summit in Seattle last 
November. 
  During the meeting that took place in a friendly and candid 
[tan shuai di 0982 3764 4104] atmosphere, the two sides also 
exchanged views on other issues of mutual concern. 
  Ronald Brown, U.S. secretary of commerce; Anthony Lake, 
national security adviser to the president; Strobe Talbott, 
acting secretary of state; and Robert Rubin, chairman of the 
National Economic Council, attended today's meeting. Also

Planning Commission; Liu Huaqiu, vice minister of foreign 
affairs; and Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United States.

  [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua held talks with U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown and Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary 
separately here today on the prospect of cooperation in the 
fields of economy, trade, science and technology. 
  According to Chinese sources familiar with the talks, the 
two 
sides reached identical views that China and the United States, 
as two big countries with decisive influence in the world, share 
extensive common interests and objectives and that the building 
of good relations between them is not only in the interest of 
the two countries and peoples, but also contributes to the world 
peace and stability. 
  Secretary Brown was quoted as saying that encouraging 
progress had been achieved in many important areas of U.S.-China 
relations. The United States, he promised, will continue to work 
for developing long-term economic and trade ties with China. 
  Secretary O'Leary told her Chinese guests she always 
considers U.S.-China relations as being full of potentialities 
and that the two countries are long-term partners of economic 
and trade cooperation. 
  The Chinese vice-premier said that a good foundation has 
been 
laid for the development of cooperation between the two 
countries in the fields of economy, trade, science and 
technology. As China is speeding up the establishment of a 
socialist market economy, the Chinese market is holding out an 
ever greater potential, which is also becoming a reality. This 
will provide broad prospects of cooperation for the two 
countries. 
  If things go well in Sino-U.S. relations and man-made 
trammels are removed, their economic and trade cooperation will 
be further expanded, the Chinese vice-premier added. 
  Secretary Brown was said to have reaffirmed during the talks 
that the United States is firm in its support for China's 
resumption of its seat as a founding member of GATT. 
  The Chinese sources said that the two sides also discussed 
specific issues regarding the expansion of cooperation and they 
agreed that the candid, pragmatic and friendly exchange of views 
they had today was very useful.

  [Text] Washington, 2 May (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua held separate talks with U.S. Commerce 
Secretary Ronald Brown and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary on the 
morning of 2 May. The two sides unanimously felt that as two 
big countries possessing decisive influence in the world and 
sharing extensive common interests and objectives, building [gao

States not only conforms to the interests of the two countries 
and peoples, but also contributes [you zhu yu 2589 0504 0060] to 
the world's stability and peace. 
  Brown and O'Leary held separate discussions with Zou Jiahua

  [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
Commerce Ronald Brown hosted a dinner party here this evening in 
honor of visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua and his party. 
  In his welcoming remarks, Brown said he hopes Zou's visist 
will mark a new beginning of U.S.-China relations. 
  He said the two countries have a lot in common and how their 
relations will develop is something that has a great bearing on 
both American and Chinese peoples. 
  It is his belief that with the joint efforts by both sides, 
the difficulties that exist at present can be overcome, Brown 
said. 
  In reply, Vice-Premier Zou said his current visit is aimed 
at 
keeping the momentum of high-level contacts between China and 
the United States and exploring, together with U.S. leaders and 
friends from the industrial and business community here, ways to 
expand economic and trade cooperation between the two countries 
and pushing ahead bilateral relations in all fields. 
  When the world is making the transition from the old pattern 
to a new one, he noted, economic considerations are becoming an 
increasingly important factor in international affairs. 
  As the largest developing and the largest developed 
countries, China and the United States have great 
complementarity in the economic and trade fields, he said, 
adding that these favorable subjective and objective conditions 
have afforded Sino-U.S. economic relations and trade a broad 
prospect for development. 
  China's economy, he continued, is entering a period of high 
growth and its tremendous market potential is being tapped. In 
face of the huge China market, people of vision and businessmen 
of different countries are considering and formulating their 
strategies from a new perspective in order to meet the 
increasingly fierce competition, he said. 
  Zou expressed his sincere hope that the foresighted people 
in 
the U.S. industrial and business community will seize the 
current historic opportunity to expand their business in China. 
"What is more, I hope the U.S. Government will render more 
support to its people in their efforts to compete in China and 
create necessary conditions for them," he stressed. 
  He described it as the duty of the leaders of the two 
countries to give top priority to the fundamental and long-term 
interests instead of being swayed by a single, fleeting event. 
  So long as the two governments abide by the principles 
enshrined in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques and the 
principle of enhancing mutual confidence, reducing trouble, 
increasing cooperation and refraining confrontation, Sino-U.S. 
relations will register a greater development, the Chinese 
vice-premier said. 
  Zou arrived in Washington last weekend to pay an official 
visit. He is the highest-level Chinese leader to visit the 
United States in five years.

  [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua said here today that China's economic 
development since the policy of reform and opening-up was 
adopted in 1979 has drawn worldwide attention and it is 
optimistic about its economic performance in both short and long 
run. 
  Speaking at a gathering in Washington D.C. at the invitation 
of the U.S.-China Business Council, Zou briefed leaders of the 
U.S. business community on China's reform, opening-up and 
economic development as they show strong enthusiasm and 
expectations for closer economic cooperation with China. 
  Zhou said that through its efforts for nearly half a 
century, 
China has established a fairly independent and complete economic 
structure. Its economic success, especially since 1979 has 
drawn the attention of the world. Compared with 1978, its GDP 
in 1993 was nearly 4 times as large, showing an average annual 
growth rate of 9.3 percent over the period, making China one of 
the fastest growing economies of the world. 
  After outlining a three-step strategy for China's 
modernization drive formulated in the early 80s, Zou described 
1993 as a year which saw China's reform, opening-up and 
modernization drive move forward vigorously. The gross domestic 
product of the year was up by 13.4 percent over the previous 
year in comparable prices and it was the highest annual increase 
since 1985. High growth has driven reform and opening-up to 
speed up, two way trade to expand and overseas investment in 
China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment actually used 
increased by 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was up by 91.5 
percent over 1992. By the end of 1993, China had approved 
174,000 overseas invested projects with a contractual value of 
217.216 billion U.S. dollars, of which 60.042 billion have been 
actually invested. The total volume of China's imports and 
exports in 1993 reached 195.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which 
imports accounted for about 100 billion dollars. 
  Zou told the gathering that China is speeding up the 
construction of the Pudong New District in Shanghai in order to 
turn the city into an international economic, trade, and 
financial center and at the same time continuing to stress 
agriculture, basic industries, pillar industries and 
export-oriented industries and undertaking such large projects 
as the three gorges hydropower complex. "These no doubt will 
mean more and better investment opportunities for American 
businessmen," he said. 
  The basic goal of China's economic restructuring as decided 
at the Chinese Communist Party's 14th National Congress is to 
establish a socialist market economy and this is a far-reaching 
step in the history of China's reform, he stressed. 
  The Chinese vice-premier then turned to the major reform 
measures of the day, i.e., to transform the operational 
mechanisms of state- owned enterprises, nurture and develop a 
market system which will play a basic role of allocating 
resources under macro-regulation of the state, establish a 
network of macro-regulation taking indirect regulation as the 
principal means, and institute a multi-tiered social security 
system. 
  He assured the American businessmen that China will keep 
unswervingly to the policy of opening-up to the outside world. 
He quoted Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform, 
as saying that "China's open policy will not change for this 
century, nor the first or second 50 years of the next century. 
It is hard for anyone to attempt at a change. China's door is 
sure to open even wider and we will do a better job." 
  An all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast 
with 
the hinterland across China is taking shape, Zou said, and "we 
are ready to develop economic and technological cooperation and 
exchanges with all friendly countries and people from all walks 
of life on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." 
  Cooperation can take many forms, he continued. "Trade with 
us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see more business 
people with acumen come to China to invest and set up their own 
factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises, 
or to transfer technology and explore China's market." 
  He listed energy, transportation, telecommunications, 
agriculture and water conservancy as the areas where China would 
like to see more investors put their money now and in the years 
to come. 
  Referring to the problems which were created along with the 
economic boom, Zou stated that the Chinese Government introduced 
last June a series of measures aimed at tightening and improving 
macro-regulation. These timely measures yielded quick and 
positive results. The financial order and the order in the 
field of circulation improved markedly and the signs of an 
economic overheating have been brought under control. 
  "At the present, our market is steady, society stable and 
people contented. We are convinced that with our efforts, 
socialist market economy will take root in our country and our 
economy will continue to enjoy a high and healthy growth for a 
considerably long time to come," he said.

  [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua today urged China and the United States 
to seize the opportune moment by pushing vigorously for 
exchanges and cooperation in various fields. 
  Speaking at a gathering of U.S. businessmen hosted by the 
U.S.- China Business Council here, Zou said that over the 15 
years since China and the United States established diplomatic 
relations, despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the 
overall relations between the two countries have moved forward 
with exchanges and cooperation in various fields on constant 
increase. The world has undergone some major and profound 
changes in the past few years, but the importance of Sino-U.S. 
relations remains unchanged. They have extensive shared 
interests and common responsibility in many areas such as 
safeguarding world peace and stability, ensuring a secure and 
prosperous Asia-Pacific region, promoting global economic 
prosperity and bringing about a better environment. 
  One outstanding feature of the post-Cold War world, he said, 
is that all countries have given their top priority to economic 
development. Asia-Pacific region, by maintaining the best 
growth records for years running, has caught attention in the 
world. On the other hand, he added, international economic 
competition, as seen in fierce rivalry for market shares, has 
become increasingly heated. New opportunities and new 
challenges keep presenting themselves one after another. 
  Under such circumstances, he stressed, it behooves both 
China 
and the United States to seize the opportune moment by pushing 
vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of 
economy, trade, science and technology. "This is not only in 
the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also 
contributes to peace, stability, prosperity and progress of the 
world at a large," he noted. 
  Speaking of bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic 
and technological cooperation, Zou said, in 1993, Sino-U.S. 
trade volume reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars according to 
Chinese customs statistics, which was an increase of more than 
ten times over 1979, with China's imports from the United States 
up by 20.1 percent over the previous year. The United States 
has retained its place as China's third largest trade partner. 
In terms of investment volume, the United States still leads 
other overseas investors. By the end of last year, the 
contractual value of U.S. investment in China had totalled 11 
billion U.S. dollars, and the number of U.S. funded projects 
surpassed more than 8,000. More than half of American 
investment in China was made by large companies and their 
projects are large in scale, high in technological standards and 
quite profitable. 
  Facts have shown, Zou said, that it is entirely possible for 
countries of different social systems and ideologies to actively 
develop economic and technological cooperation to the benefit of 
both sides. 
  Zou maintained that the differences between China and the 
United States in the economic and trade fields are being ironed 
out gradually with the signing of a number of memorandums of 
understanding in 1992. 
  "What I want to emphasize is that the Chinese Government 
will, as always, honor its commitment in accordance with the 
requirements of the three memorandums of understanding. We hope 
that the U.S. Government will also strictly honor its 
commitment. In our view, all the problems between us can be 
resolved by way of negotiation and consultation as long as the 
two sides abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit." 
  He promised that China's sustained and rapid economic growth 
and its ambitious development program will surely bring about 
more opportunities for the American business community. For 
example, every year China imports from the United States large 
quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizer, 
cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment and 
equipment for chemical and petroleum industries. It is expected 
that from now to the year 2000, China will import one trillion 
U.S. dollars worth of commodities from the international market. 
"We hope that American businessmen will take up a larger share 
of that import," Zou said. 
  However, he reminded the audience that competition among the 
world's major powers in the Chinese market is very intense. 
Advanced technology and equipment and fine service alone are not 
enough. "They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable and 
harmonious environment for cooperation in the economic and trade 
field," he said. 
  "Frankly speaking," he pointed out, "American business 
people 
are not as advantageously placed as their counterparts in Europe 
and Japan. It is very clear that the annual dispute over the 
MFN status causes serious damage to the development of economic 
and trade ties between our two countries." 
  Then he stressed that the mutual granting of MFN status is 
the foundation stone for Sino-American economic and trade 
relations. If this is undermined, it will do serious damage to 
the economies and trade of the two countries and to the 
interests of their consumers." 
  He deemed it the duty of the Chinese and U.S. governments to 
encourage and support business people of the two countries to 
conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable 
conditions for closer bilateral relations. 
  He stated that the Chinese Government always attaches 
importance to the relations with the United States and has made 
tremendous and effective efforts to improve and develop them. 
Facts have proved, he added, that "so long as the two sides act 
in accordance with the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, bear 
in mind the larger picture, stand on high ground and extend the 
vision, we will be able to rise above the present differences 
and bring bilateral relations back on track soon for a healthy 
development, thus contributing to stability and prosperity in 
the Pacific rim and the world at large."

  [Text] Chicago, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Zou Jiahua, Chinese 
State Council vice premier, visited the U.S. AMOCO oil company, 
which has enjoyed long-term cooperative relations with China in 
Chicago on 29 April, and had a discussion with the person in 
charge of the company about the possibility of further expanding 
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
  AMOCO is a big enterprise occupying an important position in 
the international oil and natural gas field. It began 
cooperation with China in oil exploration and production and 
petrochemical industry in the late seventies. It is the first 
U.S. company to sign an agreement with China on oil exploration 
on land. It also participates in the development of oil fields 
in the South China Sea. 
  AMOCO Chairman (Lawrence Fuller) and others accorded a warm 
reception to the visiting Chinese guests at the company's head 
office in an 80 story building in the center of Chicago. He 
reviewed the company's fruitful cooperation with China in the 
past and presented a concept of further participating in China's 
energy development. Zou Jiahua expressed his appreciation and 
support for AMOCO's policy and plan that attach importance to 
long-term cooperation with China. 
  At a banquet hosted by (Fuller) in honor of Zou Jiahua and 
his party in the evening, (Fuller) said he believed Vice Premier 
Zou Jiahua's visit will play a role in promoting the company's 
friendly cooperation with China as well as the development of 
U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  Addressing the banquet, Zou Jiahua expressed thanks to AMOCO 
for its efforts for the unconditional renewal of the 
most-favored-nation status by the United States for China and 
for its support for the restoration of China's position as a 
GATT signatory. 
  He said economic relations and trade between the two 
countries have enjoyed continuous development through the joint 
efforts of the Chinese and American peoples, U.S. industrial and 
commercial enterprises, and U.S. personages with breadth of 
vision. He pointed out that there is a very strong possibility 
for Chinese and U.S. economies to supplement each other, and 
that economic relations and trade between the two will surely 
further enjoy rapid development so long as both sides solve the 
problems that crop up on the basis of equality and mutual 
benefit. 
  Prior to the banquet, the China National Petroleum 
Corporation and AMOCO signed a "letter of intent on cooperation 
in conducting research in coal seam and gas at areas south of 
the Eerduosi Pendi [Basin]." 
  In the morning, Zou Jiahua and his party visited Motorola, 
Inc. near Chicago.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Japan's newly formed 
cabinet headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has a support 
rating of 56.8 percent, the YOMIURI SHIMBUN newspaper reported 
today. 
  This approval percentage is the third highest ever for a 
Japanese cabinet, following 71.9 percent for the Hosokawa 
cabinet last August and 60.5 percent for the tanaka cabinet in 
1972. 
  The telephone poll was conducted by the YOMIURI daily 
earlier 
this week. 
  The disapproval rating for the cabinet stood at 25 percent. 
  About 45 percent of the respondents favoring the cabinet 
said 
it "can do something new," and 24 percent said Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata "can be trusted." 
  The major drawback cited for the cabinet was its fragility, 
the paper reported. 
  Hata's cabinet was formed earlier this week to replace that 
of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned on 
April 8 because of controversial personal finances.

  [Text] Canberra, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A China trade and 
investment forum will be held in Australia's big cities of 
Melbourne and Sydney early next month in a bid to give a further 
impetus to economic cooperation between the two nations. 
  The forum, initiated by the Chinese Government, will be held 
from June 1-2 in Melbourne and from 7-8 in Sydney and will be 
joined by more than 100 representatives of Chinese industries, 
the largest business delegation ever to visit Australia. 
  The forum was agreed by the two sides last October when Wu 
Yi, China's minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, 
paid a visit to Canberra. 
  The event also follow the Australia-China forum held in 
Beijing organized by Austrade last year. 
  Austrade's East Asia regional office manager Martin Walsh 
said in a release today that the forums will provide a unique 
opportunity for the Chinese Government and business officials to 
outline investment and environment policies for Australian 
business. 
  He said that China continues to be of increasing importance 
to Australian exporters and the forums will offer outstanding 
opportunities for local firms to follow up with key contacts 
from China. 
  "The forums will also give Chinese company executives and 
other decision makers a chance to witness first hand Australian 
technology, industry expertise and capability," he said. 
  The two forums will mainly focus on sectors of building and 
construction, transport and telecommunications, food technology 
and manufacturing. 
  China, the largest buyer of Australia's wool, is the ninth 
largest export market for the South-Pacific country, with a two 
way trade standing at three billion U.S. dollars last year.

  [Text] Lagos, April 30 (XINHUA) -- Nigeria is ready to 
learn from China in culture, science and technology, education 
and public health, a Nigerian minister said here on Friday [29 
April]. 
  Nigerian Information and Culture Minister Jerry Gana made 
the 
remarks in a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria Hu 
Lipeng and Cultural Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in Nigeria 
Dai Xingyuan. 
  In particular, Nigeria wants to learn traditional medical 
science from China, he said. 
  China has done a good job in mobilizing its population of 
over one billion to solve their own problems and develop their 
own country, he said, adding that "this means China is 
successful in informational and cultural publicity. Therefore, 
Nigeria wants to learn from China." 
  During the meeting, the Nigerian minister accepted the 
invitation by the Chinese Culture Ministry to pay a visit to 
China next year. 
  His future China tour will help the two countries to further 
expand Nigerian-Chinese cultural exchanges and strengthen mutual 
understandings between the two most populous nations in the 
world [as received], he said. 
  Besides, the Nigerian minister pledged that the Nigerian 
Government will continue to carry out the projects this year 
which should have been completed last year according to the 
Sino-Nigerian program on cultural and educational cooperation 
and exchanges. 
  As part of the program, three Chinese students arrived in 
Lagos last evening to further their study of Hausa language, one 
of the three major languages in Nigeria, at Ahmadu Bello 
University in north Nigeria. 
  On the other hand, China has received 10 Nigerian students 
since last year who are studying in Chinese universities and 
colleges. 
  Speaking with XINHUA after the meeting, the Chinese 
ambassador said that they held the meeting in "a very friendly 
atmosphere." 
  Also present during the meeting were directors of major 
departments in the Nigerian Information and Culture Ministry. 
  China and Nigeria signed an agreement on cultural 
cooperation 
in September 1981. Since then, the two countries have signed 
three pacts or programs on cultural and educational cooperation 
and exchanges.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren today told visiting Hungarian Chief Public Prosecutor 
Gyorgyi Kalman [spelling of name as received]: "we should handle 
the relationship between reform and stability in a better way." 
  Meeting with a Hungarian delegation led by Kalman at the 
Great Hall of the People here this morning, Rong said China will 
use stable and proper methods to control its annual national 
economic growth rate at about nine percent, so as to ensure its 
social stability and steady economic development. 
  He said that building up the legal system was an 
indispensable part of maintaining the country's social stability 
and economic development. 
  Over the past few years, he said, China has drawn up a great 
number of laws, but they still did not fully meet the needs of 
its economic growth. 
  Rong said: "we will rely on our own efforts to build the 
legal systems. At the same time, it is necessary to absorb 
foreign countries' useful experience." 
  On bilateral relations, Rong said China and hungary are 
friendly countries. In recent years, the two countries have 
enjoyed very good cooperation in the field of economy and sound 
exchanges in building up legal systems. 
  The frequent exchanges of visits between the leaders of the 
two countries have boosted bilateral friendly ties and 
cooperation, he said. 
  Rong expressed the hope that the delegation's current visit 
will play a role in furthering bilateral relations. 
  Kalman said Hungary places great importance on developing 
its 
ties with China, adding that it is of great significance to 
develop such ties because China is one of the countries in the 
world which are playing a decisive role and also a permanent 
member of the United Nations Security Council. 
  He said Hungary was attentively watching China's building up 
of its legal system and was willing to develop its ties with the 
country's law departments. 
  Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, participated in the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Zhou Dongyao: "Time for Hungarians To Choose"] </F>
  [Text] Budapest, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Flags of various 
colors representing different parties are flying over the Danube 
River bridge. Huge pictures are hung everywhere in the streets 
of the capital city. 
  The time has arrived again for Hungarians to choose. 
  The Hungarian general elections, which occur every four 
years, begin on May 8. Of the more than 90 parties across the 
country, 15 are eligible to take part in the campaign. 
  The exhausted party leaders are shuttling from city to city, 
from metropolis to countryside, shaking hands, smiling, making 
speeches and criticizing their opponents. 
  Everyone in this country is waiting for the time to vote, 
and 
for the election results. 
  In these elections, voters will choose 386 new 
representatives to form the new National Assembly. Those 
parties with five percent of the vote will have representatives 
in the Assembly. 
  The two or three parties with the most representatives will 
form the government; the others will be opposition members. 
  In the 1990 elections, the Democratic Forum party received 
the most votes. It allied with the Small Holder's Party and the 
popular Christian Democratic [People's] Party and formed a 
cabinet. The Alliance of Free Democrats, the Socialist Party 
and the Federation of Young Democrats become opposition parties. 
  However, in the past four years great changes have taken 
place. Opinion polls from the end of last year until now show 
that the Socialist Party is the favorite, followed by the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, the Federation of Young Democrats, 
the Democratic Forum, the Small Holder's Party and the popular 
Christian Democratic [People's] Party. 
  The ruling parties are losing their dominance, while the 
opposition parties are gaining. The opposition Socialist Party, 
according to the polls, could win as much as 25 percent of the 
vote. 
  Why have such changes occurred? it is widely believed that 
the change is happening because the ruling parties have not 
devoted their energies to economic development. 
  The country's economy declines every year, budget deficits 
rise, the jobless rate increases, and inflation remains high 
while fraud occurs in the process of privatization. This has 
all been pointed out by the opposition parties, who conclude 
that "the present economic situation is worse than 1990". 
  The most recent opinion poll found that only one percent of 
the people surveyed believe the government has done "very well", 
27 percent say "good", 34 percent say "poor", 21 percent say 
"very poor" and 17 percent say they don't know. 
  But the ruling parties insist that they have done quite 
well, 
and that the country has been the most stable in Eastern Europe 
over the past four years. The government has achieved progress 
in economic reform, and the country has gained more foreign 
investment than any other in Eastern Europe. Yes, they say, the 
government has made some mistakes, but they have been corrected 
in time. 
  Peter Boross, Hungarian prime minister, believes he should 
be 
prime minister for another four years. He strongly opposes the 
Socialist Party assuming power, and rules out an alliance with 
the Alliance of Free Democrats. 
  Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, responding to both domestic 
and foreign fears and speculations, affirmed repeatedly that 
Hungary will not change its policies after the election. 
  However, it is believed that changes will be made in 
diplomatic policy and the administrative program after the 
election, though no party will change the multi-party 
parliamentary system, privatization or the market economy. 
  Such changes, if they were to occur, would send shock waves 
through the country, and no doubt in all of Eastern Europe. So 
the Hungarian people face a choice with great significance.

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- Crime has become so rampant 
in the Chinese countryside that in some places clans and triads 
are now more powerful than the communist party, the LEGAL DAILY 
[FAZHI RIBAO] warned Tuesday. The lawlessness means Beijing is 
having more and more trouble controlling the social, economic 
and political situation outside the big cities, it said. "All 
types of criminality and delinquency are increasing in the 
country," the newspaper reported, adding that in certain 
villages "clans and triad-type organisations have supplanted the 
communist party." 
  Triads -- secretive groups with extensive involvement in 
organised crime activities -- have long been banned in China but 
have reportedly been making a comeback. 
  It said clans, which have deep roots in China because of the 
cultural importance given to lineage and family ties, have also 
gotten out of hand, often seizing control of land, water, roads 
and crops. 
  Faced with this explosive situation, "party organisations 
are 
sometimes in a state of paralysis," the newspaper complained, 
calling for an increase in the number of police. The Legal 
Daily said the fault lay with local leaders but also with a 
general population obsessed with getting rich at any cost, and 
had led many individuals and even villages to decide to settle 
scores with rivals. Last year, police listed 600 such battles 
between villages that had left 100 peasants dead and another 
2,000 wounded. Making a resurgence in the countryside along 
with traditional local hatreds was what the LEGAL DAILY 
described as reactionary behaviour, notably prostitution and the 
sale of women and children. 
  If many peasants find themselves richer as a result of the 
economic reforms which led to the dismantling of the commune 
system set up by Mao Zedong, tens of millions are worse off and 
find themselves living in harsh conditions. More than 100 
million people in the countryside are now considered surplus 
labour. Disturbances in several provinces broke out last year, 
provoked by rural discontent over rising prices and taxes and 
the corruption of local officials, and officials have expressed 
fear the trouble will be repeated this year.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 April (XINHUA) -- The Propaganda 
Department recently issued a circular urging propaganda 
departments of all local CPC committees and press units to 
persevere in promoting professional ethics among reporters. 
  The circular says: Economic crime offenders involved in a 
grave case in which the Changcheng Company of Mechanical, 
Electrical, Scientific, and Technological Industries in Beijing 
illegally raised funds were given sentences in accordance with 
the law. Meanwhile, reporters who received bribes and concocted 
misleading public opinions for this illegal funding activity 
were punished in accordance with the law. A small number of 
reporters who could not resist monetary temptations compiled 
fake stories aimed at confusing the public. As a result, they 
severely disturbed the economic order and damaged the interests 
of the state and the people. They also tarnished the reputation 
of the party's papers. We should learn from this lesson and 
further improve professional ethics among reporters. 
  The circular points out: Since the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, China has achieved, under the 
party's leadership, outstanding results in the press work and 
made important contributions to the drive of reform, opening up, 
and socialist modernization. The overall quality of our 
reporters is good. Specially after the issuance of the circulars 
concerning the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying and selling 
of book numbers," the ill practices that are against the 
professional ethics of the press and publications have been 
curbed. We must treat the bans on "paid journalism" and "buying 
and selling of book numbers" as well as the effort to improve 
professional ethics among reporters as a long-term work and 
persist in carrying it out. By using the above-mentioned case 
as a negative example, we should launch a thoroughgoing campaign 
to boost journalistic ethics and strengthen the construction of 
the press. 
  The circular urges propaganda departments of all local CPC 
committees and press units to conduct, in the light of the 
guiding spirit of the national meeting on propaganda and 
ideological work and local realities, an investigation on the 
work of carrying out the "circular concerning strengthening the 
construction of the professional ethics among the reporters" 
issued by the Propaganda Department and the Press and 
Publications Administration last year. Those who achieve good 
results should be commended while those who continue the ill 
practices of "paid journalism" should be severely dealt with. 
It is necessary to organize reporters to conduct discussions on 
the Changcheng Company case and draw lessons from it. In the 
light of the characteristics of their work, press units should 
formulate relevant regulations and systems to tighten 
self-discipline and conscientiously accept public supervision. 
It is necessary to energetically advocate the work style of the 
reporters who go deep into the realities of life, who immerse 
themselves among the masses, who maintain closed ties with the 
people, and who work hard. We should commend collectives and 
individuals who go down to the grass-roots units, who are honest 
in performing their duties, who observe laws and disciples, and 
who make outstanding contributions to the drive of reform, 
opening, and modernization.

<H5>  Xiamen Customs Crack Down on Forged Bills, Chops </H5>
  The Xiamen Customs recently set up a special group to crack 
down on smuggling and maintain normal imports and exports.

certificates, customs chops, and signatures of the customs 
officials were all forged. The Xiamen Customs also found that 
the lawless elements in society frequently forged papers to 
smuggle goods in and out of the country. In view of this, the 
Xiamen Customs maintained contacts with the Guangdong and 
Shanghai Customs, found their weak links, and took joint action

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (AFP) -- The Chinese Foreign 
Ministry said Tuesday it was "not aware" of any upcoming nuclear 
test by China, as announced by the Japanese Government. "China 
keeps the attitude of utmost restraint towards nuclear tests. 
The number of nuclear tests it has conducted has been quite 
limited," a ministry spokesman said. "I am not aware of any 
nuclear test in the near future." 
  Deputy Japanese Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito on Monday 
said China would soon carry out a nuclear test, and called on 
Beijing to scrap the operation. A western expert in Beijing 
said "it would not be surprising" if there were a nuclear test 
in the near future, as China carries out such tests in the 
spring and the autumn for climatic reasons. 
  China's last nuclear explosion took place at the underground 
Lop Nor site, in the northwest of the country, on October 5. It 
was the 38th test -- other counts put it as the 39th -- carried 
out in the autonomous region of Xinjiang since 1964. Foreign 
experts said the test, with a yield of 70 to 80 kilotonnes, was 
apparently part of a miniaturisation programme aimed at 
developing a multiple-warhead missile. 
  The United States has carried out around 950 nuclear tests, 
Russia about 600, France 200 and Britain 60.

<F P=106> [By reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yang Zhaobo </F>
(2799 0340 3134)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president, and Li 
Peng, premier of the State Council, met this afternoon with 
representatives of the honorable winners of the State Natural 
Science Prize, State Invention Prize, State Scientific and 
Technological Progress Prize, and State Spark Plan Prize for 
1993, at the Great Hall of the People. Jiang Zemin extended 
warm congratulations and paid high tributes to prize winners and 
to scientists and technicians working in various sectors across 
the nation. He urged the broad mass of scientists and 
technicians to sow the seeds of scientific progress across the 
country and contribute even more to the development of the 
economy and to social progress. 
  Jiang Zemin said Comrade Deng Xiaoping incisively proposed 
an 
important exposition that "science and technology are the 
primary productive forces." His exposition has developed 
Marxist theory on science and technology and played a great 
promotive role to China's science and technology work and to the 
entire economic construction. Those who are involved in science 
and technology work must persist in implementing the policy of 
"holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" as 
this policy has correctly solved the relationship between basic, 
applied, and development research. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out that the great practice for reform 
and development requires being armed with correct theory and 
rich knowledge. All levels of leading comrades should study 
hard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and information on a socialist market 
economy and on modern science and technology so as to constantly 
score new victories for China's socialist construction. 
  Present at the meeting with the prize-winning 
representatives 
and attending the prize-award meeting were Wen Jiabao, Lu Jiaxi, 
Li Peiyao, Song Jian, Chen Junsheng, Luo Gan, and others. 
  For those who are involved in science and technology, 
receiving a national scientific and technological prize has been 
viewed as a top honor. The entire evaluation and screening 
process to select the winning projects and winners for the 1993 
national scientific and technological prizes has ended. 
Following a hectic evaluation and screening process, several 
thousand scientists, professors, and experts selected 781 
outstanding scientific and technological results and 4,484 
winners. A total of 52 scientific and technological results won 
State Natural Science Prizes; 441 won State Science and 
Technology Progress Prizes; and 113 won State Spark Plan Prizes. 
The percentage of prize-winning trade and industry are as 
follows: 42.9 percent for industry, transportation; 16.8 percent 
for farming and animal husbandry; 6 percent for basic research; 
9 percent for culture, education, and public health; 19.6 
percent for national defense and public security; and 5.7 
percent for other sectors. Incomplete statistics show that the 
accumulated economic benefits generated following the 
implementation of the prize-winning scientific results, many of 
them reaching the world's advanced level, top 21.3 billion yuan. 
  Zhu Lilan, executive vice minister of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, spoke at today's meeting. She said the 
party and government adopt the principle of using both spiritual 
and material incentives, with the emphasis on spiritual, to 
encourage scientific and technological personnel. This system 
has produced the desired effect of "not only encouraging an 
individual but also a lot of other people and of not only 
encouraging a particular project, but also many other projects." 
Through encouragement, we provide guidance on the direction of 
scientific and technological development to various levels of 
scientific and technological units; effectively help promote 
conversion of scientific and technological results to 
production; bring about close integration between science and 
economy; enhance the people's awareness of science and 
technology; strengthen the cohesive force among scientific and 
technological workers; spread patriotism, collectivism, and the 
spirit of work-dedication; and advance the cause of socialist 
spiritual civilization.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Private and Collective Tech Firms Expand </F>
Role"] 
  [Text] The non-State high-tech firms in China have vowed 
to play a greater role in the country's modernization drive and 
the development of its market-oriented economy. 
  The pledge follows the central government's call to 
encourage 
all economic sectors to contribute more to China's development, 
while letting the public sector play a leading role. 
  Private and collectively-run science and technology firms 
have flourished as the country is switching from a planned 
economy to market-oriented reforms. 
  "They can respond quickly and flexibly to the market needs, 
said Wang Zhigruo, Executive Secretary General of the China 
Association for Science and Technology. 
  The wider the market opens, the more these firms can 
contribute to technological development "because they are 
intrinsically market-oriented," Wang pointed out yesterday at an 
ongoing three-day meeting sponsored by the China Non-State 
Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Association. 
  These enterprises aim to introduce their research products 
to 
the market "as soon as possible," he added. 
  The practice of combining capital, talent, resources, 
equipment and technology in the non-State science firms is 
setting an example for science and technological development 
throughout the country, according to Wang. 
  These private and collectively-run enterprises are expected 
to attract more foreign capital and technology in the future, 
which will speed their technical progress and help them occupy 
the international market. 
  Most of the capital will support scientific research and the 
development of new products, the meeting was told. 
  The Stone Group, a well-known collectively-owned computer 
firm in Beijing, last year listed its shares in the Hong Kong 
stock market. 
  "This will not only help them accumulate development funds 
but will also help transform their business management," Wang 
told the meeting. 
  Another prominent non-State science firm, the Beida Fang 
Zheng Group, a leader in digital Chinese word-processing and 
typesetting systems, has seen its products widely accepted by 
Chinese publishers worldwide. 
  There are now 45,000 private and collectively-run science 
enterprises in China, employing a workforce of 1.2 million, Wang 
said. 
  The industrial and trade volume of these enterprises last 
year topped 50 billion yuan ($5.7 billion). More than 100 of 
the firms own assets valued at more than 100 million yuan ($11.5 
million) each. 
  Most of these enterprises deal with technology-intensive 
industries including chemicals, telecommunication, computers, 
building materials, medicine and environmental protection 
technology.

  [Text] Qingdao, April 27 (XINHUA) -- A data 
telecommunications network today went into operation in Qingdao, 
a booming coastal city in east China's Shandong Province. 
  The network, called Digital Data Network (DDN), consists of 
three parts: a group exchange node system, a digital 
information processing system and optical fiber cables. 
  The first phase of the project has 19 nodes and 648 
terminals, capable of covering the whole area of Qingdao. 
  When joined with the country's main public exchange system, 
it will provide telecommunications services to large and 
medium-sized cities throughout China. 
  And it will also offer international data telecommunications 
to and from 26 countries and regions around the world, including 
the United States, Japan, France and Germany.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporters Yang Jisheng (2799 4949 </F>
4939) and Zhang Jimin (1728 4949 3046): "Secret Green Light Sent 
to the Universe] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  Out of curiosity, we reporters visited the place at night 
recently and took the liberty to knock on the door. After 
making clear what we had come for, Chen Xianjun, deputy head of 
the satellite observation station, received us warmly. This 
engineer said only those who visit at night will be impressed by 
the observation station. Due to technical reasons, the station 
only conducts observations at night and does not turn on the 
instrument in the day time. 
  Deputy head Chen led us to the monitoring room, which is 
equipped with all kinds of electronic instruments. The red 
signal light kept twinkling and the telecommunications sign 
sounded clearly and melodiously. Signs and figures moved up and 
down on the computer screens. 
  Deputy head Chen told us the so-called satellite tracking is 
to measure the distance between the satellite and Earth at all 
times. To be more specific, it is to measure the distance 
between the satellite and the observation spot at all times. 
  We asked: "How many satellites can the station track?" 
  He hit several keys on the computer keyboard and the screen 
showed the directory of observed satellites and times they were 
close to the sky over the observation station. There are nine 
satellites: the U.S. Geodesic Satellite, the Japan Violet 
Satellite, the European Remote Sensing Satellite No. 1, the 
French Maritime Hydrographic Satellite, and so on. 
  [passage omitted] 
  Although the principles are very simple, it is very 
difficult 
in operation. The furthermost satellite is some 20,000 km from 
the Earth and is rotating continuously. To ensure the error of 
measurement does not exceed 4 cm, we should utilize modern 
science and technology to guarantee the speed. For example, the 
velocity of light is 300,000 km per second in the physics 
textbooks; however, here we use an even more accurate speed: 
29.9292458 km per second. As for time, one second passes in a 
twinkle; however, here 10.000000000001 [as published] second, 
the unit of time, can be accurately counted. Deputy head Chen 
said proudly most of the instruments ranging from laser devices 
to precision measuring instruments are produced in China. The 
turning on of the laser device, sending and receiving the laser 
beam, as well as data recording and processing are operated by 
all kinds of instruments in the monitoring room. They are 
operated automatically by computers by programs designed 
previously. [passage omitted] 
  "We heard that a foreign laser weapon is used to hit 
aircraft. Can a laser sent from the station penetrate the human 
body?" we asked. 
  "It would be OK if a laser strikes any part of the human 
body, except the eyes. Once the eyes are stricken, serious 
burns will cause blindness. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking of satellite ranging, engineer Chen was extremely 
excited. His words brought us to a remote space. He said: 
"The precision of laser ranging is pretty high. Its error is 
at the cm level. Think about this, the average value of global 
sea level obtained with such precision is very precious data. 
Now it is said that the global weather is getting warmer and 
less snow falls than melts in the Antarctic Pole; if it causes 
the raising of the sea level, a rather reliable numerical value 
can be obtained at the satellite observation station. In 
addition, the India massif moving northwards not only raises 
Mount Qomolangma, but also moves the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau 
northwards close to Tian Shan. A massif's moving rate can be 
obtained through satellite ranging. [passage omitted] 
  Now through satellite ranging, it is known that Shanghai is 
moving 2 cm toward Japan annually. Of course, satellite ranging 
is not limited to this application. We cannot calculate the 
satellite orbital angle or establish the zero-level global 
network without it." 
  It is learned from the satellite observation station that, 
as 
far as such global data is concerned, it is not sufficient to 
rely only on the station in Beijing and the other three stations 
in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changchun. Close cooperation among 
relevant scientists in the international community is needed. 
This is a global industry. There are some 40 satellite ranging 
stations in operation in the world, sending data obtained to the 
international satellite ranging data analyzing and processing 
center in the United States. Data will be provided to 
scientists and technicians worldwide after being processed. As 
engineer Chen summarized: "Utilize satellite and laser 
technology to conduct experiments on Earth on which we depend 
for existence, so that we can give an early warning as soon as 
we find an abnormal state unfavorable for the existence of human 
beings." [passage omitted] 
  Do you want to find the station's location? The green light 
is sent to the universe from 39 degrees 36 minutes 22.3 seconds 
north latitude and 115 degrees 53 minutes 36.87 seconds east 
longitude.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhou Tao (0719 3447): "At Political Work </F>
Meeting Held by PLA General Logistics Department, Director Fu 
Quanyou Stresses Need To Strengthen Ideological and Political 
Work"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (JIEFANGJUN BAO)--The ideological 
and political work on the logistics front must be closely linked 
with professional work in all aspects with the aims of providing 
"effective guarantees and support," fully arousing the 
initiative and creativity of all quarters, and ensuring the 
smooth fulfillment of the Army's tasks. This point was stressed 
by Fu Quanyou, member of the Central Military Commission and 
director of the General Logistics Department, at today's 
political work meeting of the General Logistics Department. 
  Fu Quanyou pointed out: The in-depth development of reform 
and opening requires us to do ideological and political work 
more effectively; improve education in socialism, patriotism, 
revolutionary heroism, and fine tradition; strive to enhance the 
ideological and moral quality of the troops; and to guide 
officers and servicemen to establish a correct outlook on life 
and a set of correct values. 
  Fu Quanyou stressed: Arming the minds of officers and men 
with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and unifying the thinking and action of the 
troops according to this theory, is the primary task in our 
present ideological and political work. At all times and in all 
circumstances, we must guarantee that the troops will resolutely 
obey the orders of the party Central Committee and the Central 
Military Commission, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and 
must effectively guarantee the smooth implementation of the 
political and military orders. For the General Logistics 
Department, the results of the ideological and political work 
should find expression in the fulfillment of all professional 
tasks, especially in the enhancement of the support capacity and 
combat effectiveness of the troops. It is necessary to 
seriously implement the military strategical principles for the 
new period, actively converge with the market economy, deepen 
reforms in the logistics work of the armed forces, and strive to 
enhance the overall level of the logistics work. The troops 
should be prompted, through ideological education, to carry 
forward the five types of revolutionary spirit advocated by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit 
set out by Comrade Jiang Zemin. More effective work should be 
done to improve the party style and to keep the troops 
incorruptible. In particular, people responsible for managing 
money and materials must be kept under effective supervision. 
Cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, should be 
prompted through ideological education to maintain the style of 
hard work, to take pride in working honestly and incorruptibly, 
not to seek personal gain and fame, to live plainly and work 
diligently, and to make selfless dedications. At the same 
meeting, Zhou Keyu, political commissar of the General Logistics 
Department, made a speech on striving for solid results in 
ideological education and on prompting political cadres to keep 
a good image. Wang Tailai, deputy director of the General 
Logistics Department, and Xu Sheng, deputy political commissar 
of the General Logistics Department, also attended the meeting.

<F P=106> [By Wang Jianwei (3769 1696 0251), deputy director of the </F>
Editing and Research Office of the Political Department of the 
Guangzhou Military Region: "It Is Necessary To Consolidate the 
Authority of the Central Leadership"] 
  [Text] In Volume 3 of Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly stressed the need to 
maintain and consolidate the authority of the central 
leadership. This is an important idea that Comrade Xiaoping has 
stressed many times in the process of leading reform and 
construction in our country, and is an important component of 
his theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
It is certainly of great immediate significance to study this 
concept of Comrade Xiaoping's in connection with the realities 
in our present reform, opening, and economic construction. 
<H8>  I. </H8>
  Why is it necessary to stress the need of consolidating the 
authority of the central leadership while it is necessary to 
decontrol and enliven things in the course of developing the 
socialist market economy? 
  Consolidating the authority of the central leadership 
is a need in the development of the socialist market 
economy. Although the market can play an effective role in 
the distribution of resources, it is not a panacea and has its 
own weaknesses and deficiencies. For example, it is hardly 
possible for the market to completely guarantee the balance 
between gross demand and gross supply in society, and this may 
cause periodic fluctuations in economic development; it is hard 
to maintain a reasonable order of competition within a short 
period of time; it can hardly solve the issues of 
infrastructural construction and environmental protection 
required by economic development; and it can hardly ensure 
fairness in the distribution of resources and wealth. The 
settlement of all these issues requires the government's 
necessary macrocontrol and management over market activities. 
Macrocontrol is, in essence, central control. Therefore, the 
authority of the central leadership must be consolidated. 
  Consolidating the authority of the central leadership 
is a need in reform, opening, and economic invigoration. 
In view of the fact that some people were keen to adopt their 
own countermeasures against the policies laid down by the upper 
authorities in the course of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping seriously pointed out: "In order to make reform a 
success, we must carry it out in an orderly way under unified 
leadership. Otherwise, there will be disorder everywhere, and 
people will just go their own way. How could reform be 
successful under such circumstances?" He also said: "We must 
fix a principle. That is, reform should be carried out in depth 
under the unified leadership of the central authorities." China 
is a large country. Reform in such a large country will 
inevitably lead to the adjustment of interest relations in 
various aspects. At the same time, China is a developing 
country, and is facing such problems as an ill-coordinated 
production structure and an undergrown market, so we will 
inevitably encounter various difficulties when carrying out 
reform and establishing the socialist market economic structure 
if "the party Central Committee and the State Council lose their 
authority and cannot control the situation." In practice, our 
reform's successes were attributed to the fact that reform was 
carried out in an orderly way under unified leadership. 
According to different conditions, major reform measures were 
adopted after corresponding backup measures were ready in some 
cases, or after pilot schemes were carried out and successful 
experience was gained in other cases. This prevented a shock to 
society. For example, without the leadership of the party 
central body and the State Council and without the authority of 
the party central body and the State Council, the macrocontrol 
in 1993 would not have achieved the expected results. 
  Consolidating the authority of the central leadership 
is a need in the correct handling of relations between 
localities and a need in accelerating our economic 
development. Ours is a large socialist country with vast 
territory, and local economic development is uneven. Reform and 
opening up enables the southeast coastal areas to give full play 
to their economic and geological advantages and to develop ahead 
of other areas, thus bringing along economic development in 
other localities. However, such uneven development is also 
directly related to the issue of local interests. In order to 
correctly handle such interest relations and settle such 
contradictions, there must be the authority of the central 
leading body. Comrade Xiaoping predicted this issue long ago, 
and pointed out that the early development of the coastal areas 
"will bring along better development in interior areas, and this 
is a matter concerning the overall situation. The interior 
localities should take the overall situation and overall 
interests into account. As development continues, the coastal 
areas will be required to make greater contributions to help the 
interior localities develop, and this is also an issue 
concerning the overall situation. At that moment, the coastal 
areas should also subject themselves to this overall interest. 
All this will not be possible if there is no central authority." 
  Consolidating the authority of the central 
leadership is a need in giving play to the superiority of the 
socialist system and tiding over difficulties. When 
mentioning the superiority of the socialist system, Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping always linked it with the authority of the central 
leadership. He pointed out: "As compared with capitalism, 
socialism's superiority is reflected in the fact that the whole 
country can be coordinated as a chess game and strength can be 
concentrated to guarantee key projects." Ours is a socialism 
with the means of production mainly in public ownership, and the 
people share the same fundamental interests. The party and the 
government can concentrate the strength of the whole nation to 
arrange key projects in the national economy according to the 
long-term fundamental interests of the entire people. In times 
of difficulty, the party and the government can mobilize the 
strength of all quarters to overcome and tide over difficulties. 
For an economically backward large country, all this is 
indispensable. In view of the fact that too many "local lords" 
went their own ways and this made it impossible to make or carry 
out decisions on important matters, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
sharply pointed out: "Nobody is allowed to disobey the 
instructions of the central leadership and the State Council. 
In particular, in times of difficulty, without the authority of 
the central leadership and the State Council, it is impossible 
to solve problems. With such authority, great accomplishments 
can still be made in times of difficulty. The authority cannot 
be denied, and centralization should be effected if necessary; 
otherwise, at the very least, time may be wasted." This year, 
the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made sufficient 
preparations for the adoption of the new reform schemes. 
However, no reform scheme could be perfectly designed before it 
was put into practice, and the reform tasks remain arduous and 
complicated. In order to overcome the difficulties of 
structural reforms, the authority of the central leadership must 
be consolidated. This is an important guarantee for our efforts 
to further deepen reform and promote the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure. 
<H8>  II. </H8>
  By stressing the need to consolidate the authority of the 
central leadership, we do not mean that we should use the 
previous methods. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out long ago: 
"In the past, we just exercised management on the basis of 
poverty; now, things are different, and we are exercising 
macromanagement for the purpose of building a comparatively 
well-off society. We cannot continue to use the methods we used 
in the past when we were facing difficulties. Now the central 
authorities should issue instructions and wield power only on 
major issues and on issues concerning the general orientation." 
Here he explicitly pointed out the two different methods of 
consolidating central authority in the different periods. 
  The content of consolidating the central authority has 
changed. In the past, the government was both manager and 
direct investor. It had to control the overall scale and 
structure of the economy, and also had to take care of 
microeconomic input and output. This caused a situation in 
which the government's functions were lumped together with those 
of enterprises, and enterprises did not have any decisionmaking 
powers. At present, the economic activities of enterprises are 
oriented to the market, and enterprises will become units 
operating independently on their own and bearing sole 
responsibility for their profits and losses. In such 
circumstances, the government's control over the market will 
only be found on "major issues and issues concerning the general 
orientation." That is, the government will just take care of 
the overall balance and the optimization of the overall 
structure. The microeconomic decisionmaking powers will be 
delegated to the enterprises, which will make decisions on their 
own according to market signals. At present, the central 
authorities have stressed the need to resolutely control the 
size of investment in fixed assets and to continue to stabilize 
and develop the rural economy. This is exactly the concrete 
expression of macrocontrol. 
  The method of exercising central authority has 
changed. In the past, the government laid down various 
targets to determine the scope of the enterprises' economic 
activities, and directly managed the enterprises' production, 
product marketing, and materials procurement, as well as the 
enterprises' personnel, material, and financial affairs. At 
present, the government mainly applies economic means, guiding 
enterprises with the market mechanism to bring their activities 
into line with the overall macroeconomic development targets. 
In the past, the government managed the economy according to 
the administrative powers of the departments and the local 
authorities, and arranged projects and distributed money and 
materials according to the plans. At present, the government 
mainly applied the economic and legal means to ensure the 
implementation of the development programs, to coordinate the 
interest relations of the market entities, to supervise market 
operation, and to provide necessary services for the market. Of 
course, the government can still use administrative power if 
necessary to interfere in economic activities. The reform 
measures of the fiscal, tax, and banking systems adopted this 
year showed that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
mainly applied economic means to exercise macrocontrol. 

<H8>    III. </H8>
  What should be done in order to consolidate the authority of 
the central leadership? Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: 
"This should find expression in the effectiveness of the 
central instructions." To achieve this purpose, two points must 
be stressed: 
  First, take overall interests into account. To do 
this, we should first understand the overall interests. This 
year, the general guideline for the work of the whole party and 
the whole nation is: Grasp the opportunity, deepen reform, 
expand opening, promote development, and maintain stability. 
The whole party must clearly understand this general guideline 
which represents the overall interests, consider and handle 
things according to this guideline, and bring things into line 
with the guideline. Second, we should understand the importance 
of safeguarding overall interests. Take this year's fiscal and 
tax reform as an example. If such reform is not carried out, the 
state's financial revenue will account for too small a 
percentage of the gross national product, and the government 
will have no sufficient financial capacity for performing its 
administrative functions and for making reasonable and effective 
redistribution of the limited resources among various 
localities. It is obvious that such a situation must not 
continue. Moreover, it is necessary to correctly handle the 
relationship between the partial interests and the overall 
interests and between the immediate interests and long-term 
interests. Some things may be feasible in certain localities, 
but they may not be acceptable to the overall interests; some 
things may not be desirable according to local interests, but 
they must be done according to the overall interests. So we 
must take the overall interests into account. At present, some 
local governments and some departments only care about their 
partial and immediate interests. They do not act in unison with 
the central authorities' macrocontrol. For example, as the 
scale of investment in fixed assets is too large, some comrades 
are still keen to start new projects and expand investment, and 
are still keen to vie with each other in rapid growth and in 
ostentation and extravagance, and some comrades recklessly 
issued shares and bonds without regard to the financial needs of 
the state's key construction projects. All this went against 
our current overall interests. All localities and departments 
must always take the overall interests into account, and must 
always make their partial and immediate interests subordinate to 
the overall and long-term interests of the whole nation. 
  Second, stress discipline. While resolutely 
carrying out the new reform measures adopted by the party 
central leadership and the State Council, it is also necessary 
to continue the resolute enforcement of the discipline laid down 
by the party central leadership and the State Council for 
macrocontrol. For example, the fiscal and taxation department 
should continue to resolutely carry out the regulations laid 
down by the State Council: Strictly control tax reductions, 
strictly control financial expenditures; stop bank overdrafts; 
and do not get involved in commercial credit business without 
the approval of the People's Bank of China. This year, the 
tasks of reform and development are arduous. As long as we can 
willingly safeguard and consolidate the authority of the central 
leadership, unify understanding and action under the leadership 
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, take the 
overall interests into account, and observe discipline, then we 
will certainly be able to maintain stability, promote 
development, and win the tough reform battle.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA correspondent Huang Qunwen (7806 5028 2429) and </F>
reporter Liu Jianxin (0491 1696 2450): "Feature: A Sharp Sword 
of South China and Shield of Peace -- Hong Kong Notables Watch 
Military Show by a Guangzhou Military Region Unit"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 1 May (XINHUA) -- The smoke of gunpowder 
filled the air as guns roared. Under the cover of tanks, troops 
from a reconnaissance squad launched a fierce attack on a high 
area guarded by the "enemy." Machineguns on the tanks spurted 
flames [as received], while mortars continually shelled 
positions afar. Before we knew it, brave soldiers who kept 
appearing and disappearing in the billowing smoke had planted an 
army flag on the "enemy's" position ... [ellipses as received] 
Hong Kong notables seated on the reviewing stand burst into 
applause. 
  Yesterday, 216 Hong Kong notables arrived for a visit to 
Guangzhou-based troops under the Guangzhou Military Region 
[GMR]. This morning, the Hong Kong compatriots went to the GMR 
firing range in Guangzhou's suburbs by car to watch a military 
show put on by a unit. 
  At 0930, Henry Fok Ying-tung, vice chairman of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference; Lu Ping, director of the State Council Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office; and Zhou Nan, director of the XINHUA NEWS 
AGENCY Hong Kong branch, reviewed Guangzhou-based unit in the 
company of GMR Political Commissar Shi Yuxiao amid powerful and 
majestic martial music. 
  "Its military spirit was shaped by strict discipline, its 
fame shakes the southern territory." This unit possesses 
triphibious capability for ground, sea, and air battles. Highly 
difficult and dangerous training programs, such as the 
10,000-meter swim at sea, emergency maneuver across 1,000 km, 
field survivorship, and parachuting produced this "sharp sword 
of Lingnan [Guangdong and Guangxi]," which is well known 
throughout south China. 
  Two signal flares lifted into the air with a pop, raising 
the 
curtain for the military show. Four shooters shot down their 
targets to display 20 big red characters -- "politically 
qualified, militarily skillful, functionally sound, observing 
strict discipline, providing powerful safeguards" -- in front of 
the audience, winning a burst of warm applause. After that, the 
officers and men performed 10 programs, including "rapid mobile 
firing," "hand-to-hand combat," and "sub-squads seizing 
important positions behind enemy lines." Nine officers and men 
accurately shot the head, chest, and right and left legs of a 
"human body" at the first try. Mr. Henry Fok Ying-tung, seated 
on the reviewing stand, picked up the microphone and said: 
"Will shooter No. 2 please shoot the left leg of human target 
No. 1?" As his voice died down, the rifle immediately fired and 
got the target's left leg. Lu Ping and then Zhou Nan also 
instructed in succession specific shooters to shoot specific 
spots and the targets were missed not even once. 
  "I have been to many countries and watched some military 
shows. Our Liberation Army's military skills and caliber are 
among the best." Before Mr. Li Jinwen [7812 6930 2429], a 
lawyer at a Hong Kong legal firm, could finish his words, his 
wife chipped in at his side: "These young men are all excellent 
in martial arts. It is really amazing that each one could 
skillfully handle eight or nine different kinds of weapons." 
  As the Hong Kong notables were praising the sharpshooters, a 
dozen or so fully armed soldiers wearing camouflage coats fired 
from the top right-hand side of the reviewing stand. All acted 
like tigers with wings and compelled admiration when they 
performed the program of "traction and traversing" [qian yin 
heng du 3677 1714 2897 3256]. 
  Mine-laying with rockets pushed the show to its climax. 
Rockets shot into the sky one after another, making piercing 
whizzes. Like petals slipping from the hand of a fairy maiden, 
mines hanging on small parachutes showered on the ground and 
thick growth of grass, building a formidable defense line and 
creating a sea of death. 
  At 1100, the military show concluded amid applause and 
praises. Madam Zhang Yongzhen [1728 3057 3791], vice president 
of the Hong Kong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told reporters 
with feeling: "I shed tears with joy after watching the 
soldiers' brilliant performance. The people's safety and 
well-being and the country's strength and prosperity are 
inseparable from the strong army of the people. I am proud that 
our country has such a powerful and civilized army." 
  On behalf of the visiting group of Hong Kong notables, Mr. 
Henry Fok Ying-tung presented the troops with a silver plate 
engraved with the characters "Steel Great Wall" and also wrote 
"Steel Great Wall" as his message in the visitors' book. The 
Hong Kong notables enthusiastically posed with the officers and 
men for photographs and shook hands with them in farewell.

in the peaceful reunification of China and the return of Hong 
Kong to the motherland.

of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and Lu Ping, director of 
Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 1 (XINHUA) -- A group of Hong Kong 
residents arrived here tonight after a two-day visit to the 
barracks of a People's Liberation Army (PLA) unit in the Chinese 
mainland. 
  The visit was the first of its kind ever arranged for Hong 
Kong compatriots. 
  During their stay in Guangzhou, capital of south China's 
Guangdong Province, the delegation paid a visit to the 
headquarters of the Guangzhou Military Region, where they were 
warmly received by the region's top officers. 
  The 200-member-strong delegation, which mainly comprised 
public figures from various circles of Hong Kong, toured the 
barracks and watched a military performance in the northeastern 
suburbs of Guangzhou City. The well-trained soldiers of the 
PLA and their skills and colorful life in the barracks have 
deeply impressed the delegation. Many of the visitors believed 
that such tours could promote the communication and 
understanding between the PLA in the Chinese mainland and people 
in Hong Kong.

  [Text] A trip to learn more about the training methods of 
the People's Liberation Army in order to allay fears about Hong 
Kong's post-1997 garrison turned into a lecture in Communist 
Party history yesterday. Hong Kong affairs advisers saw nothing 
more than an army dormitory on the first day of their two-day 
visit to the People's Liberation Army (PLA) facilities in 
Guangzhou. A senior mainland official told the SUNDAY MORNING 
POST that the troops seen by the 111-strong delegation were not 
those that will be stationed in Hong Kong after 1997. 
  Hong Kong National People's Congress delegate Liu Yiu-chu 
said the trip was a waste of time, despite mainland media claims 
that many visitors had enjoyed the day. Senior PLA officers 
spent much of yesterday briefing the visitors on the history of 
the Red Army before World War II, Ms Liu said. "From the 
party's point of view this may be very important but this is not 
what we came here for," she said. They should have organised a 
modern exhibition for us." Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) 
social and security sub-group convenor Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai 
branded as superficial the effort to show the PLA on the first 
day. 
  However, XINHUA (the NEWS CHINA NEWS AGENCY) had a different 
version of the impact. It reported that several visitors said 
that with such an army, they were fully confident of a peaceful 
return of Hong Kong to the mainland. Several PWC members called 
for further displays of the PLA at work, and asked that the Hong 
Kong people be allowed to see the army in action. Such displays 
could help people to understand the PLA and lessen any fear of 
the troops. 
  The delegation saw PLA soldiers from the elite Red One 
Company, officials said. XINHUA deputy director Zhang Junsheng 
insisted that the PLA had a good track record, despite its image 
being greatly undermined by its role in the 1989 crackdown on 
pro-democracy groups. Mr Zhang admitted there had been a recent 
case of PLA officers beating people in Shenzhen, but added: 
"This was only a specific case and was done by a minority 
group. If you extended this to a general picture, this is not 
good thinking." 
  Hong Kong media was refused permission to cover the PWC 
visit, but newly appointed Hong Kong affairs adviser, Anthony 
Cheung Bing-leung, said it had contained "nothing sensitive" and 
should have been opened for media coverage.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Bring Up New Hands With a Firm </F>
Faith"] 
  [Text] It has been 30 years since the Defense Ministry 
named the "Steely Eighth Company of the Nanhai Outpost." Thirty 
years have passed, things have changed, and so have generations 
of officers and men, but the "Steely Eighth Company" has always 
retained a steel-like style and discipline. During the period 
of reform and opening up, in particular, their spirit of 
arduously pioneering a cause and of being self-sacrificing, as 
well as their might, indomitable spirit, and unstained character 
make them an even brighter and more eye-catching banner of our 
Army. With what was that good steel -- the Steely Eighth 
Company -- tempered? It was tempered with a firm faith: the 
communist faith. This is a valuable experience worthy of 
serious study by all walks of life in the great practice of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  "Having a firm faith" is a principle to which our party 
always adheres in the course of party building. It is also a 
principle by which the Army should build itself. During the 
extremely formidable revolutionary struggle, it enabled our 
party and Army to have an indomitable spirit and strict 
discipline, and it united the people to triumph over innumerable 
difficulties and dangers. Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed it up, 
saying: "In our arduous struggle over the past decades, we have 
relied on a firm faith to unite the people to struggle for their 
own interests. Without such a faith, there would have been no 
rallying force. Without such a faith, there would have been 
nothing." 
  "A firm faith" is still the soul of the party and the Army 
during the booming period of reform and opening up. Only by 
having a firm faith can our party and Army retain their inherent 
qualities, carry forward the glorious tradition of arduous 
struggle, and unite the people for the realization of the "four 
modernizations." 
  It is the most basic requirement for the new "four have's" 
people to "have a firm faith." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "By 
saying that the factor of mankind is important, we do not mean 
ordinary men, but those who have a firm faith, are aware of the 
people's interests, and struggle for them." Today, reform has 
already entered the stage where key problems are being tackled, 
and interest relationships have been readjusted considerably. 
At this critical moment, we demand all the more that large 
numbers of officers and men like the "Steely Eighth Company" 
have a firm faith in their hearts, be willing to make selfless 
sacrifices, and act as a guide to society regarding the outlook 
one should have on tribulation, happiness, and values. 
  At the present stage, as far as the broad masses are 
concerned, fostering a firm communist faith is a question of 
vigorously promoting and strengthening education. For Communist 
Party members and the officers and men of the People's Army, 
however, it is a question of discipline. This is determined by 
the nature, aim, and tasks of our party and Army. They must 
keep the communist faith in mind at all times, and must 
encourage and spur themselves on to have a deeper understanding 
of the people's interests. The reason the "Steely Eighth 
Company" can staunchly pioneer a cause in the face of 
difficulties and adversities, can remain untempted in the face 
of money worship and hedonism, and can be willing to stand guard 
duty for foreign-invested enterprises, is that they realize they 
are the servicemen of the people, and the builders of the 
communist abode. Therefore, they consider it a steely discipline 
to arduously pioneer a cause and to be self-sacrificing. 
  In order to foster new hands with a firm faith, it is 
necessary first to educate young people, including young 
officers and men, with lofty ideals and a sense of discipline. 
For one thing, they are a main force in the modernization drive 
and are the hope of achieving our goals down the centuries. If 
they have no faith, no ideals, and no discipline, it will be 
difficult for them to take up heavy responsibilities, and it 
also will be impossible for use to achieve socialist 
modernization. On the other hand, the money worship, hedonism, 
and ultra-individualism existing in society always have young 
people as the main object of their seduction. If we do not 
stress ideals and discipline, corrupt and decadent things will 
seize the opportunity to take over and probably will interfere 
greatly with the pace of our advance. 
  Education in faith and ideals is an advantage in our party's 
ideological and political work. Our Army has a wealth of 
experience in this respect, such as "education illustrated with 
history" and "passing on experience, giving help, and setting an 
example to new hands." They are not only clear-cut systems, but 
are also vivid and dramatic. The practice of the "Steely Eighth 
Company" shows that as long as we activate our minds, the form 
of education in faith and ideals will be rich and colorful, 
meaningful and wonderful scenes can be seen everywhere 
throughout the Army and the country, and heroic achievements 
during the new period and the experiences of ideological and 
political work will be carried forward to a great extent and 
will blossom everywhere.

<F P=106> [From the "990 Morning News" program] </F>
  [Text] Listeners, Lieutenant General Gu Hui, commander of 
the Nanjing Military Region and chairman of the People's Air 
Defense Committee of the region, emphasized at the regional 
people's air defense work conference -- which closed yesterday 
-- that the work on people's air defense should be enhanced to a 
new level to better meet requirements of the socialist market 
economy and partial wars under conditions of modern high 
technology. The following is a report filed by station reporter 
(Yao Shukun) from the meeting place yesterday. 
  [Begin recording] [Yao] Concentrated population, congested 
buildings, heavy traffic, limited land, and environmental 
pollution are problems that have become more and more 
conspicuous in urban modernization construction. What will we 
do with an international, large city like Shanghai, where the 
highest population density has exceeded 160,000 people per sq 
km, with a mere 2 sq-meter per capita road space, which is 
one-fourteenth and one-fifth of that of London and Tokyo? Lt. 
Gen. Gu Hui said going underground would be an effective way out. 
  [Gu] In light of the development of China's urban 
modernization construction, developing and utilizing underground 
space also has become an inevitable trend. Based on the 
principle of dual use for peace and war time, upgrading and 
constructing people's air defense works and shifting certain 
ground facilities underground are important features in 
developing and utilizing underground space. 
  [Yao] It has been learned that people's air defense projects 
that have been developed by and put into use in Shanghai -- 
including warehouses, workshops, markets, hospitals, hotels, 
activity rooms, and cultural and entertainment centers -- have 
saved the use of city land, activated the market economy, 
facilitated the people's work and lives, and initially 
demonstrated the fine prospects of opening up underground space. 
Lt. Gen. Gu Hui pointed out that the construction of people's 
air defense should be enhanced to a new level. 
  [Gu] Time has proved that investment in the people's air 
defense construction is not an unworthy consumption; the 
efficiencies and benefits it generates and the wealth it created 
for the state have far exceeded its input. Hence, we, the 
leadership at various levels, including comrades engaged in 
people's air defense work, should fully understand its value and 
strengthen propaganda education for all sectors of society to 
seek all-level consensus -- a bid to create a fine social 
opinion and environment to guarantee continuance of the people's 
air defense construction for a long time. [end recording]

  [Text] Yichang, May 2 (XINHUA) -- An equipment leasing 
market will be built for the construction of a gigantic water 
conservancy project at the Three Gorges on the middle reaches of 
the Chang Jiang river. 
  Yuan Guolin, deputy general manager of the China Chang Jiang 
River Three Gorges Development Corporation, said that his 
company, which is in charge of building the dam, welcomes large 
domestic and foreign equipment manufacturers to come to 
establish an equipment leasing market at the dam construction 
site. 
  The dam which is designed 185 meters high and nearly 2 km 
long will take 17 years to finish. When completed, the 
hydroelectric plant will have a generating capacity of 17,800 
megawatts. At present, preparations for the project has entered 
its peak time of digging, giving rise to great demands for large 
construction equipment and machinery. 
  As public bidding has been adopted in the construction of 
different sections of the entire project, the deputy manager 
explained, many contractors of different sections of the project 
do not have enough fund to buy the whole set of equipment needed 
in the actual building. 
  "If they can afford to buy all the construction equipment 
needed, it still would eventually lay idle after completion of 
the contracted section," said the deputy general manager, adding 
that construction speed would also be greatly affected by the 
period to import equipment after winners of a bid are decided. 
  The deputy general manager said that his company would adopt 
preferential measures to lure domestic and overseas equipment 
manufacturers to lease their products at the Three Gorges area, 
while continuing to import some large equipment to lease to 
companies which have contracted construction of sections of the 
project. 
  According to him, the China Chang Jiang River Three Gorges 
Development Corporation has already bought large construction 
equipment and machinery worth 200 million yuan and has leased 
them to companies which need the machinery for construction.

  [Text] Xian, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The Xian branch of the Bank 
of China (BOC) has provided 4.5 billion yuan in loans to 
foreign-funded enterprises since 1990, which has brought about 
678 million U.S. dollars in foreign trade volume. 
  According to an official of the branch bank, the bank has 
also provided 210 million yuan in loans and various financial 
services to Xian-based enterprises. They include trust and 
investment, securities and credit card services. 
  The branch, which was established only five years ago, has 
opened accounts for 70 percent of the local Sino-foreign joint 
ventures 
  The Xian Xigu Optical Fiber Co. Ltd, a Sino-Japanese joint 
venture, is one such enterprise. It was established with the 
help of 26 million yuan and 500,000 U.S. dollars in loans from 
the branch bank. The company earned 37 million yuan in profits 
from domestic sales and over one million U.S. dollars from 
exports in the first year of its formal operation. 
  Another two Sino-foreign joint ventures set up by the Xian 
printing plant have become major profit-makers in this capital 
of northwest China's Shanxi Province, with the support of loans 
from the local BOC branch.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (CNS) -- Statistics collected 
from economic and trade departments in China show that 
investment made by Hong Kong, Taiwan and overseas groups and 
companies in the Mainland has tended to increase with a rise in 
foreign investment in the country during the first quarter of 
this year. 
  Tianjin Municipality saw foreign investment valued at US$120 
million in place in the first quarter of this year or 120 
percent up over the same period last year while Guangzhou 
Municipality registered foreign capital valued at US$489 million 
or 80.8 percent. Foreign investment in Beijing, Shanghai and 
Fuzhou showed various gains. 
  Foreign investment tended to have an increasing share in 
newly approved joint-ventured enterprises and items while some 
consortia and leading companies tried to have a 
more-than-50-percent share in their investment in enterprises 
and items in a bid to grab the decision-making or dominant power. 
  Solely foreign-funded enterprises, meanwhile, are increasing 
with 85 out of 194 foreign-funded enterprises newly registered 
last month in Shenzhen being of such kind. 
  There were 637 foreign-funded enterprises newly approved 
between last January and March in Beijing and 554 such 
enterprises in Tianjin, with each city having pledged foreign 
investment of over US$1 billion. The utilization of contracted 
foreign capital indicated a gain with US$1.945 billion in 
Shanghai and US$3.384 billion in Guangzhou. 
  Tertiary industry has become a popular sector for foreign 
investment with a rebound in investment in real estate. There 
were 161 items of tertiary industry invested by foreign 
businessmen in Shanghai during the first quarter of this year. 
The pledged foreign capital introduced for these items was put 
at over US$1 billion, making up 60 percent of the gross foreign 
capital. 
  Tianjin saw 35 foreign-related real estate items signed 
during the first quarter with pledged investment valued at 
US$170 million. Some overseas groups including the Hong Kong Lai 
Sun Group entered the real estate market in Shanghai while the 
Beijing branch of L &amp; D Limited was very busy with real 
estate 
items. 
  As small- and medium-sized items tended to integrate into 
one 
another, the number of main consortia, items invested and the 
value involved in investment were both on the rise. Some 11 
internationally known companies including the McDonald's 
Restaurants of the United States and Sony of Japan made 
investment in Shanghai while some 30 multinational companies 
such as General Motors of U.S., the ABC company of Switzerland 
and Siemens Ag. of Germany are now holding negotiations on items 
for investment or on the establishment of headquarters in China. 
  In Guangzhou there are consortia and companies from 19 
countries and regions competing with one another for investment. 
Contracted foreign investment signed with seven countries and 
regions including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao and the United States 
was valued at over US$20 million on average. By the end of last 
March, ten out of 42 top wealthy ethnic Chinese figures around 
the world who have invested in Fuzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong and 
Russia joined forces recently to set up a military-turned-civil 
high technology industry base in Pudong New Zone. 
  There are to date some 5,000 branches of Hong Kong, Taiwan 
and overseas companies and groups set up in Beijing and high 
grade office buildings are in great demand for foreign 
investors. Branches of Hong Kong companies running in Guangzhou 
no longer dominate the municipality while the United States and 
Japan and Germany are setting up branches there at a rapid pace. 
  Foreign investors tended to make use of their profits for 
reinvestment into their invested items while some of them have 
even increased their investment to a great extent. Tianjin saw 
26 foreign-funded enterprises have their investment rise by 
US$77.05 million during the first quarter of this year. 
  Medium- and long-term investment is growing with an eye on 
long- term economic results instead of short-term investment. 
  Siemens, AG. is scheduled to set up 20 to 30 joint-ventured 
enterprises in the Mainland in the coming two years with total 
investment valued at US$500 million. Yaohan of Japan plans to 
open 1,000 supermarkets by the year 2010 while New World of Hong 
Kong will make investment totalling HK$30 billion in the 
Mainland. A projection said that 1994 would be a boom year when 
foreign investment in the Mainland would grow more and more.

<F P=106> [By Cong Gong: "Self-Financed Health Plan Replaces Old </F>
Co-Operative"] 
  [Text] The medical co-operative system, predominant in 
rural China, has come under increasing strain as a result of a 
severe funding shortage. 
  And the situation is made worse by more and more 
cash-strapped doctors leaving the service. 
  However, the system -- which still has the support of the 
majority of farmers -- is now seeking to finance itself. 
  Rural authorities have been raising funds for the 
co-operative health care system using various sources including 
the State, institutions and individuals. 
  The practice is paying off in Shandong Province, according 
to 
a survey carried out by the Medical, Public Health and Sports 
Sub- commission of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC). 
  The rural medical co-operative system was initiated in the 
early 1950s. The service, staffed mainly by the "bare-foot 
doctors" -- largely urban-educated youths sent for re-education 
in the countryside during the "cultural revolution" (1966-76) -- 
helped to alleviate the shortage of medical workers in rural 
areas. 
  More than 90 percent of the rural production brigades 
adopted 
the medical co-operative system in the late 1970s. 
  But at the same time, the household contract responsibility 
system was being introduced to stimulate the rural economy -- 
and the reforms that accompanied that system have turned out to 
be unexpectedly detrimental to the collectively run co-operative 
medical care system. 
  The central government's ban on 37 sources of revenue last 
March, aimed at reducing the financial burden on peasants, led 
to medical funds being held back. 
  The rural medical service, which received 21 percent of the 
nation's medical care budget in 1978, received only 10 percent 
in 1991. 
  In Shandong Province, for instance, some rural authorities 
have refused to fund their clinics. 
  Other parts of the country have found themselves in a 
similar 
predicament. Many of the collectively funded clinics in 
Qinggang County in Heilongjiang Province are now penniless. 
  The shortage of funds has thrown many rural medical services 
into crisis. 
  Only 5 percent of the nation's villages now are able to 
afford the medical co-operative service, according to a report 
in the Legal Daily. 
  The situation has been made worse by the exodus of rural 
doctors. Two-thirds of the rural doctors in Qinggang County want 
to leave the co-operatives and set up private clinics, the 
survey found. 
  As a result of the disintegration of the co-operative 
system, 
the peasants are suffering. Once-rich farmers have become 
impoverished when they have to pay by themselves for an 
operation or medical treatment. 
  The Medical, Public Health and Sports Sub-commission has 
recommended that the village-level clinics be funded by rural 
collectives. And qualified doctors should be encouraged to sign 
contracts with clinics, said the survey. 
  To help the peasants, some areas in Shandong Province -- 
such 
as Weifang, Zhaoyuan, Changqing, and Anqiu -- are trying to set 
up a new type of co-operative medical system. 
  More than 85 percent of the townships in the province are 
raising funds from villages and individual farmers to set up and 
run medical foundations. 
  Individuals are required to pay between 2 and 10 yuan to 
join 
the foundation. Those who join get a 30 to 50 percent discount 
for their medical care.

  [Text] Beijing, May 3 (XINHUA) -- The average annual 
increase rate of overseas tourists visiting China reached a 
record 13 percent between 1985 and 1993, the highest in the 
world. 
  This figure is included in the latest statistics compiled by 
the World Tourism Organization. 
  With the quickening of China's drive of reform and opening 
to 
the outside world in recent years, China's tourism industry has 
become an important component of world tourism, said Yang 
Liuyin, a leading official with the State Administration of 
Tourism. 
  A total of 41.53 million overseas tourists visited China in 
1993 alone, up 8.9 percent over the previous year; the foreign 
exchange earnings gained from tourism reached 4.67 billion U.S. 
dollars, a hike of 18.3 percent over the 1992 figure. 
  Yang said that China has absorbed a stable source of 
tourists 
from the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Singapore, Hong 
Kong and Macao since last year. 
  Besides, big breakthroughs have been made in luring tourists 
from the Republic of Korea and other parts of the world. 
  According to official statistics, a total of 200,000 ROK 
tourists visited the Chinese mainland in 1993, most of them were 
on commercial tours. 
  The ROK tourism authorities expected the number to reach 
500,000 this year, as the ROK Government had annulled in April 
all relevant restrictions hindering ROK citizens from touring 
China. 
  Other statistics show that the Chinese mainland is now the 
best choice for Taiwan visitors. A record total of 1.4 million 
Taiwan residents visited the mainland last year, up 8 percent 
over the previous year. More and more Taiwan residents have 
diverted from the single purpose of visiting relatives to many 
other fields of activities such as commercial, cultural and 
academic exchanges. 
  The booming industry of tourism has greatly invigorated the 
national economy as a whole and provided job opportunities for 
over a million people every year, according to the official. 
  Moreover, the industry boosted vigorous development in the 
fields of construction, telecommunications, commerce, finance, 
transport and cultural exchanges.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] A government report has warned that the central 
authorities may have to use drastic measures to curb runaway 
inflation if economic overheating is not stopped. 
  The report, on the economic outlook for the rest of the 
year, 
warned if strong retrenchment measures were adopted, the 
country's momentum of growth would be thrown into chaos, leading 
to an economic "hard landing". 
  The Spring Quarterly Report was jointly compiled by 
economists at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the 
State Statistics Bureau. 
  Under one scenario, it predicted some economic 
contradictions 
would remain unresolved. It said the Government would have to 
relax macrocontrol in the face of growing opposition from 
regions and enterprises. This would lead to a "hasty rebound" 
of the economy and the revival of inflation, it said. "Based on 
the situation in the past few months, the danger remains," the 
report said. 
  It stressed the need to seek a balance between economic 
growth and inflation. "We have to accept that a considerable 
level of price rises is inevitable in the course of full-fledged 
reform. It is the price we have to pay. But on the other hand, 
we have to be on constant alert to keep the level of price 
increases to one that the public can bear. This will be 
conducive to creating conditions for reform and a relatively 
rapid pace of economic growth," the report said. 
  It said "opportunity and risk" would co-exist for the rest 
of 
1994, stressing that failure to control investment and 
money-supply would be damaging. 
  The report said the fiscal system would remain stable if the 
issue of new currency was controlled within 160 billion yuan 
(HK$142 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) and new loans did not 
exceed 550 billion yuan. 
  Fixed-asset investments would not get out of control if 
money 
supply targets were met. 
  "Even if we were able to have one or two more percentage 
points of economic growth, there would be negative impact if 
inflation surges to 20 percent. Ultimately, the economy will 
drop into a nadir. The process of economic reform will be 
severely jeopardised," it said. 
  China's economy would stay on a "positive cycle" if annual 
economic growth reached 10 percent, investment growth dropped to 
20 percent and inflation was contained about 10 percent.

for Violating Trademarks"] 
  [Text] The Guangzhou Commodity Fair Office for 
Professional Affairs made a decision not long ago to handle the 
trademark violation cases of 20 enterprises. 
  During the 75th Guangzhou Commodity Fair, it was verified by 
the Office for Professional Affairs that on the samples 
exhibited by 20 enterprises, including Shenzhen's Kaicheng 
Company, the registered trademarks of other enterprises were 
used without the permission of the owners of those trademarks, 
thus violating these trademarks, as well as the Rules for the 
Implementation of the Trademark Law and related regulations of 
the Guangzhou Commodity Fair. The Office for Professional 
Affairs studied the decision based on the Trademark Law and 
related regulations of the Commodity Fair, while taking into 
consideration of the actual conditions of the Commodity Fair, 
and punished those 20 companies that had violated others' 
trademarks according to their cases, with penalties ranging from 
circulating a notice of criticism, confiscating the exhibits 
with unauthorized trademarks, and removing them from exhibition, 
effective 26 April.

  [Text] Golmud, May 2 (XINHUA) -- A meeting was held here 
Sunday [1 May] to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the opening 
to traffic of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, a railway line with the 
highest altitude in the world winding across the Qinghai-Tibet 
Plateau of China. 
  The first phase of the railway, starting from Xining, 
capital 
city of Qinghai Province, and ending at Golmud, a city of the 
same province where the railway meets the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, 
was completed and opened to traffic exactly ten years ago. 
  Linking the remote "roof of the world" with vast domestic 
areas, the 846.9-kilometer railway is truly a life artery of 
the Tibet Autonomous Region and Qinghai Province. 
  Most parts of the line pass through either freezing areas on 
high ice-capped mountains or harsh deserts that are frequently 
stricken by natural disasters. 
  Its construction has cost years of devotion and diligence by 
more than 10,000 young technicians and workers--and even their 
lives--as well as huge state investment. 
  Also thanks to the efforts and self-sacrifice of innumerable 
workers, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been well maintained 
during the ten-year period of operation. 
  Several advanced units and outstanding individuals were 
rewarded for their dedication at the meeting. 
  They were honored for their victory in a kind of struggle 
not 
only with adverse natural conditions but also with their inner 
selves, while working all year round in extremely desolate 
places along the railway line. 
  Their sweat and blood have been rewarded with vitality and 
hope brought about by the steel dragons moving on the line. 
  During the past decade, four million passengers and 15 
million tons of cargo have been transported via the railway. 
  Difficulty in communication between Tibet and other parts of 
the country has been greatly relieved. 
  Local people suddenly find themselves among colorful 
products 
from all over the country, while veils over the mysterious land 
have also been lifted, with rich local mineral resources being 
exploited and more and more people riding the rails to visit or 
trade here.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Luo Jianlin (5012 1696 3829), and </F>
correspondent Meng Yuhong (1322 3768 4767): "Resolutely Check 
Violation of Trademarks"] 
  [Text] Trademark violation has had an unhealthy effect on 
the reputation of China's foreign trade. At recent sessions of 
the Guangzhou Commodities Fair, investigations and penalties on 
such behavior have become increasingly more serious. Some 
enterprises with comparatively serious cases of trademark 
violation have already been dealt with through the issuance of a 
critical circular. On the very day of its opening, the current 
Guangzhou Commodities Fair organized an examination of 
trademarks and found that cases of enterprises participating in 
the exhibition violating regulations and trademarks had been 
somewhat reduced compared with previous sessions. Various trade 
delegations have universally attached importance to trademark 
controls; for example, the Henan delegation has on several 
occasions independently conducted checks on enterprises under 
its jurisdiction on their implementation of the regulations on 
trademark control. Nevertheless, there were still 20 
enterprises, including the Shenzhen Kaicheng Company, which 
violated the rules, while most trademark violations fell into 
the category of marketable goods for export, and some had a 
reputation in the world market. The fair promptly adopted 
measures and sternly and quickly handled the case of any 
enterprise as soon as it was discovered. 
  Viewing the situations of the 20 enterprises the current 
fair 
has handled, their cases varied as well as their attitudes. The 
goods of some units which violated trademarks were exhibited, 
but no transactions were involved; some units had already signed 
contracts for transaction, and the trademark violations had 
become facts; while the bulk of enterprises violating trademarks 
were comparatively active and sincere in admitting their 
mistakes. When it was verified that the Shenzhen Kaicheng 
Company had violated trademarks on 16 April, the company had all 
along delayed in giving a written explanation to the fair based 
on the relevant regulations, and displayed a very poor attitude: 
a heavy penalty was meted out, its qualification to participate 
in the commodities fair was canceled, and its exhibits were 
removed. The Guangxi Machinery Import and Export Company and 
the Xinjiang Zhongxin Industrial Company were known to have 
violated trademarks in previous sessions of the commodity fair, 
and during the current fair, they repeated their mistakes. It 
was learned that with regard to the commodities fair circular on 
checking trademarks and relevant regulations, the Guangxi trade 
delegation office had already relayed them to the company 
manager; however, the manager had failed to relay them to his 
staffers. This showed that the company manager had not paid any 
attention to them. This being the case, when penalties were 
imposed on the two companies, the managers in charge were 
especially criticized in a circular. The China Shenzhen Foreign 
Trade (Group) Company was verified to have violated the "White 
Dove" trademark on its slippers, and its samples were 
confiscated; however, the responsible person on the stall 
refused to cooperate. In light of his attitude, it can be seen 
that the company knowingly violated trademarks but paid no 
attention to the relevant regulations on checking them. Thus, a 
stern penalty was imposed on the responsible person. 
  The current fair has done very specific and meticulous work 
on checking and handling trademark violations, while refraining 
from adopting a requirement for unanimity in everything, 
handling different cases according to their situation, and 
ensuring the smooth progress of the fair's export transactions, 
while firmly and promptly halting the violation of trademarks.

<F P=106> [By Huang Zhiling: "Power Shortages Cramp Industry--Lift </F>
Lid on Electricity Prices To Generate Plant Investment"] 
  [Text] To ease the country's power shortage, plans are 
under way to lift price controls on electricity, introduce a 
shareholding system into the power industry and launch an energy 
conservation publicity campaign. 
  A rational pricing system will be set up in the next three 
years, said Shi Dazhen, Minister of Power Industry. 
  Letting electricity prices reflect market demand is regarded 
as the best way to attract overseas and domestic investment, he 
said. 
  And turning all State power firms into shareholding firms 
will generate investment, he added. Under the system, 
management and ownership are separate and the legal rights of 
investors and managers are protected. 
  In the next seven years, the industry needs $25 billion to 
import generating units with a capacity of 45 million kilowatts, 
he said. Foreign loans and investment are being encouraged to 
fund the construction of power plants. 
  Investors stand to make a healthy profit, Shi said, adding 
that loans to the energy sector are a very safe investment. 
  China has been plagued by a power shortage since 1970. 
Electricity production consistently falls short of demand by 20 
percent. 
  Despite the fact that China's installed power capacity ranks 
fourth in the world, per capita production is only 644 
kilowatt-hours, two-fifths of the world average and 80th among 
all countries in the world. 
  Since the 1970s, factories, government offices and 
residential quarters in many cities have had to live with 
frequent power cuts. The shortage has grown even more acute 
since 1979, when the country embarked on its market-oriented 
economic reform. 
  All areas have had power problems except the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region. 
  Beijing, for example, has had an electricity shortage since 
the early 1970s. In 1991, power was short by 400,000 kilowatt 
hours, in l992, 493,000 kilowatt hours and last year, 683,000 
kilowatt hours. 
  The East China Power Grid, the largest in the country, 
generated 9.87 percent more electricity in the first half of 
last year than over the same period in 1992. But due to 
increasing demand, it had to cut power in Jiangsu and Zhejiang 
provinces 12,480 times in the first five months of last year, 
4.9 times the figure in 1992. 
  This year all eastern provinces except Anhui are expected to 
suffer severe power problems. 
  The crisis is worse in the South. In Guangdong Province, 
demand has exceeded supply by 30 percent over the past l5 years. 
Since l979, it has had to purchase electricity from 
neighbouring Hong Kong. Today, it spends 10 times as much money 
to buy Hong Kong electricity as it did in 1979. 
  The Northeast China Power Grid, which had met the region's 
needs until three years ago, fell short of demand by 900 million 
kilowatt- hours last year. And that figure is likely to reach 3 
billion kilowatt-hours this year. 
  Industry has been the top victim of the energy crisis. 
Frequently, local plants cut electricity first to factories. 
  Each year, according to the Ministry of Power Industry 
(MPI), 
about one-third of production capacity at factories is lost due 
to power cuts. For example, many factories in Guangdong have to 
stop operation three days a week, reducing production by 30 
percent. 
  The power industry itself has also been a victim. 
  Normally, 25 percent of generating units in power grids are 
supposed to be idle so they can be maintained and held in 
reserve in case of breakdowns. 
  But the energy crisis has forced all units into operation. 
As a result, generators that should be overhauled are still in 
operation. 
  According to international standards, generating units 
should 
be in operation less than 5,000 hours a year. But since 1970, 
China's have been exceeding 6,000 hours annually. 
  Worse, obsolete equipment continues to be used. In many 
cities, distribution networks 25 years old are still in 
operation. 
  In Shanghai's busiest commercial centre, equipment from the 
1920s and 1930s is still around. Four cities in Northeast China 
-- Dalian, Fushun, Shenyang and Changchun -- are still using 
machines left behind by the Japanese in World War II. 
  MPI officials blame the problem on inadequate investment. 
  To evaluate a country's power industry, experts use an 
internationally recognized yardstick -- the "power elastic co- 
efficient." 
  The co-efficient compares the power industry's growth rate 
to 
that of the industrial and agricultural output value. If the 
co- efficient is 1, the two growth rates are equal. If it is 
greater than 1, the power industry has grown more quickly; 
otherwise, there is an energy shortage. 
  During the past two decades, China's power elastic 
co-efficient has ranged between 0.7 and 0.75, according to MPI. 
  To remedy the problem, the World Bank has suggested that 
developing countries invest more than 2 percent of their gross 
national product (GNP) in the power industry. But between l980 
and l992, China put only 1.24 percent of its GNP into energy. 
  Enterprises in the power industry still live under the 
planned economy. They have not become independent commodity 
producers and are not accountable for losses. The State demands 
they hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in taxes and 
profit turnover. This leaves them less than 5 percent of their 
revenue to upgrade equipment and improve operations. 
  By contrast, many overseas counterparts spend half their 
earnings on development projects. In some countries this figure 
is as high as 90 percent. 
  China's electricity prices have also been kept artificially 
low under the planned system, Shi said. 
  The prices were set in 1958 and, although adjusted for the 
first time last year, are extremely low. Meanwhile the cost of 
fuel, raw material and generators has risen sharply with 
inflation. 
  From 1968 to early last year, one kilowatt-hour of 
electricity cost only 0.16 yuan ($0.018). 
  Early last year, the MPI raised the price to 0.20 yuan 
($0.023), still a far cry from the actual price. 
  For every 100 yuan ($11.5) the power industry invests, it 
loses 20 yuan ($2.3). 
  Shi said the artificially low price leads to a waste of 
electricity, affects fund-raising and severely hinders 
development. 
  Many Chinese waste energy because electricity rates are so 
low. The MPI is formulating a publicity scheme to impress upon 
the public the need to save electricity, Shi said. 
  In 1992, when experts from the World Bank voted to decide 
whether to invest in the Zouxian Power Plant in Shandong 
Province, an American expert abstained because electricity 
prices failed to reflect market demand, the PEOPLE'S DAILY 
reported. 
  To keep pace with growth, the power industry plans to 
increase the generating capacity of large and medium-sized 
generating units by more than 15 million kilowatts a year 
between 1995 and 1997. From 1998-2000, 20 million kilowatts are 
to be added annually. 
  If this is done, the country's total installed electricity 
capacity will be 310 million kilowatts by the turn of the 
century. 
  Shi said this will ease the country's energy crisis and 
bring 
electricity to 95 percent of rural households. 
  But to meet this goal, the power industry must break free 
from the planned economy, he said. 
  He stressed the need for establishing modern power 
enterprises that operate free of government interference, have 
independent decision-making power and assume responsibility for 
their profits and losses. Their property rights and other 
obligations should also be clearly defined, he said.

  [Text] Xian, May 2 (XINHUA) -- With the rapid development 
of its wool textile industry in the past dozen years, China has 
risen to become one of the major wool-processing countries in 
the world. 
  At present, all provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions of the country have wool textile enterprises. The 
country now has a total of 3.3 million wool spindles, which is 
five times that in 1980. Besides, it also has 35,000 wool looms. 
  In 1992, China produced 338 million meters of woolen 
fabrics, 
350,000 tons of knitting wool and 25 million wool carpets. 
  The country now has various kinds of advanced 
domestically-made and imported equipment for wool processing and 
rich varieties of wool products such as cashmere sweaters, 
artificial furs, camel hair cloth and other products for 
decoration and industrial use. Many of the products are fine 
finished goods. 
  Currently, the output value of the wool textile industry 
accounts for 15.7 percent of the output value of the country's 
total textile industry.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "News Analysis": "China's Agriculture Facing </F>
Challenges"] 
  [Text] Hefei, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Agriculture has always been 
given top attention in national economic construction, and 
Chinese leaders have time and again stressed its importance. 
  However, the sluggish agriculture sector is faced with 
challenges in the course of rapid national economic development, 
according to economists. 
  Last year saw the national economy develop at a speed of 
13.4 
percent compared to the previous year and the gross output value 
of agriculture grew by only four percent. 
  Although the total grain output reached a record of 450 
billion kg last year, most provinces in southern China, known as 
a "land of plenty", reported reductions in the output of grain, 
cotton and cash crops. 
  "Agriculture is the source of the basic necessities of life, 
and the supply of farm products directly affects people's living 
standards and the stability of prices," said an economist here. 
  "Once it fluctuates, people will face food problems and it 
will be difficult to construct a market economy," he added. 
  Analysing the reasons why agriculture is developing too 
slowly, Liu Jiang, minister of agriculture, acknowledged the 
government's inefficient input into agriculture, the price 
scissors between industrial and farm products, and poor 
education and imperfect basic management in rural areas. 
  China has a total population of 1.2 billion, of whom 900 
million live in the rural areas. 
  Chinese leaders have time and again stressed the necessity 
for the consolidation of the foundation of agriculture, and 
called for ensuring the annual grain output to remain at or 
above 450 billion kg and cotton, 4.85 billion kg. Farmers 
incomes should increase at a rate of 5.8 percent annually, they 
say. 
  To guarantee farm production, governments at different 
levels 
have adopted a package of policies. 
  The government of Fujian Province, in southeast China, has 
encouraged industrial enterprises to support agriculture. 
  Tong Wanheng, deputy governor, said, "The wider we open to 
the outside world, the more attention we should pay to grain 
production." 
  To encourage farmers to grow more grain, the Zhejiang 
Provincial Government has made it known to increase grain 
purchase prices this year. 
  Central China's Henan Province plans to invest 1.28 billion 
yuan in transforming low-yield farmland and building key 
irrigation projects this year, an increase of 11 percent over 
the previous year. 
  Southwest China's Sichuan Province has sent some 10,000 
agro-technicians to 30 grain production bases to offer technical 
consulting services and guide local farmers in scientific 
farming. 
  "It is hard to image Sichuan, China's most populous 
province, 
lacking grain," Zhang Zhongwei, deputy governor of Sichuan in 
charge of agriculture, said. 
  A survey shows that Chinese farmers so far have grown grain 
in 109.3 million ha [hectares], basically fulfilling the annual 
farming program. 
  The rise of state cotton purchase prices has stimulated 
farmers' enthusiasm for cotton growing. 
  In addition, the 500 state-designated marketable grain 
counties, 150 cotton-producing counties and a number of areas 
piloting in quality and efficient agriculture already have taken 
steps to promote scientific farming.

<F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "State Picks Counties To Pioneer Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] The central government has selected 13 counties 
with varying degrees of development to carry out comprehensive 
reforms aimed at bringing prosperity to farmers. 
  The counties will pioneer economic development and social 
security reform in the next three to five years as a pilot 
project for national growth, a State official said in an 
interview with CHINA DAILY over the weekend. 
  They will serve as a case-study for authorities reviewing 
the 
on- going national rural reforms. 
  The programme is based around the concept of making rich 
counties richer and allowing poor counties to climb out of 
poverty, said an official from the State Commission for Economic 
Restructuring (SCER). 
  Experts and government officials will provide specialist 
advice and help solve problems emerging from local reforms, the 
SCER official said. 
  Each model county will have a special fund from its province 
or city to ensure smooth development of reform. 
  These counties are scattered in ten [as published] provinces 
such as Zhaodong in Heilongjiang, Haicheng and Wafangdian in 
Liaoning, Huanghua in Hebei, Gongyi in Henan, Guanghan and 
Fuling in Sichuan, Xuanzhou in Anhui, Yangxin in Shandong, 
Shanyin in Shanxi, Changshu in Jiangsu, Zengcheng in Guangdong 
and Shunyi in Beijing. 
  Seven of them are in affluent river delta areas or in 
regions 
adjoining big cities while the rest lay in inland and 
mountainous regions. 
  By China's standards, five of them are considered 
"developed," six are "moderately developed" and the other two 
are "less developed." 
  "We choose those counties because they represent the actual 
conditions in this country, where levels of economic development 
differ greatly in different regions," the official said. 
  County-owned enterprises will be encouraged to switch either 
to a shareholding or shareholding co-operative system. Some of 
them will diversify to include related industrial production to 
enhance market competition. 
  The key parts of social security reform will be establishing 
solid health insurance plans and pension funds. 
  Local labour markets will also be developed to guide the 
flow 
of the surplus rural workforce, according to the official. 
  Reform of local science and education will be carried out in 
line with the local economic development. 
  Capital drawn into the pilot counties from overseas 
investors 
as well as other provinces should be used to cultivate natural 
resources, the official said. 
  These pilot counties will continue to push reform of local 
governments to serve the region's economic development. 
  The official said SCER will help hammer out a monitoring 
programme to oversee the reform process in these counties. 
  The project's evaluation will be thorough and objective and 
reflect the implementation of the reforms. 
  Information exchanges in these model counties should be 
enhanced to distribute their experiences. 
  The SCER official stressed each county will be able to carry 
out individualized reform measures.

Budget and the Draft 1994 Budget" by Weng Lihua, director of the 
Zhejiang Provincial Financial Department at the Second Session 
of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress on 26 
February 1994.] 
  1. The Execution of the 1993 Budget 
  In 1993, Zhejiang was able to maintain its good momentum of 
having a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth as a 
result of the efforts made by governments at all levels and all 
departments in following through with the instructions in 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the guidelines laid 
down by the 14th party congress, in implementing all measures 
drawn up by the party Central Committee and the State Council 
for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control, in 
carrying out the resolution of the first session of the eighth 
provincial people's congress about the report of the budget and 
final account, in continuing with the mental emancipation, in 
increasing the intensity of reform, and in accelerating economic 
growth. 
  On this basis, Zhejiang's revenue grew quite rapidly, and 
the 
financial needs of economic construction and other development 
projects were basically ensured. 
  Zhejiang's 1993 budgetary revenue authorized by the first 
session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 13 
billion yuan; but the actual amount received was 28 percent 
above target, reaching 16.665 billion yuan. That was 38.6 
percent higher than that of the preceding year. The revenue 
included business taxes of 16.411 billion yuan, which was 38.7 
percent above target and 50.6 percent higher than that a year 
before. 
  Moreover, Zhejiang also fulfilled the quota of selling 1.223 
billion yuan of treasury bonds. 
  While the 1993 spending budget approved by the first session 
of the eighth provincial people's congress was 10.096 billion 
yuan, the province actually spent 12.493 billion yuan, or 23.7 
percent more than the approved budget and 26.8 percent higher 
than the 1992 budget. The spending included 685 million yuan 
for capital construction projects--29.3 percent higher than the 
budget and 26.8 percent higher than that a year before; 1.065 
billion yuan for enterprises to tap potential and upgrade 
technology--63.9 percent higher than the budget and 70.2 percent 
higher than the 1992 budget; 1.221 billion yuan for supporting 
agricultural production and for operating expenses for 
agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy projects--24.3 
percent higher than the budget and 32.4 percent higher than that 
of a year ago; and 3.479 billion yuan for the operating expenses 
for cultural, educational, and health projects--17.3 percent 
higher than the budget and 25.2 percent higher than the 1992 
spending. In this last category, educational operating expenses 
were 2.043 billion yuan, or 28.9 percent higher than that of a 
year ago. Meanwhile, the expenditure for science and technology 
was 221 million yuan--2.3 percent higher than the budget and 
12.3 percent higher than that a year ago; 1.484 billion yuan for 
administrative expenses--30.2 percent higher than the budget and 
37.5 percent higher than that a year ago; and 571 million yuan 
for law enforcement--24.1 percent higher than the budget and 
32.2 percent more than that a year ago. 
  The provincial treasury's 1933 revenue authorized by the 
first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 650 
million yuan, but the actual income amount was 902 million yuan, 
or 38.8 percent higher than the authorized amount and 59 percent 
higher than that a year ago. The provincial treasury's 1993 
expenditure authorized by the first session of the eighth 
provincial people's congress was 2.46 billion yuan, but the 
amount actually spent was 2.64 billion yuan, or 7.2 percent 
higher than the budget and 12.3 percent higher than the 
expenditure a year ago. 
  It is expected that Zhejiang's revenue and expenditure in 
1993 could be balanced with a little surplus. This is based on 
the deduction of 4.85 billion yuan--a sum Zhejiang had to 
deliver to the central treasury (including the part of export 
tax refunds that had to be delivered to the central 
government)-- from the amount of revenue as well as the special 
subsidies of 1.03 billion yuan from the central authorities. 
  There were many reasons why the province's revenues and 
expenditures in 1993 rose so fast and exceeded the budgeted 
figures by so large a margin. On the revenue side, first, it 
was because the provincial economy, after achieving a high 
growth rate in the preceding year, continued its fast momentum, 
thereby generating more tax revenues from the production and 
circulation sectors. The province's gross domestic product 
[GDP] is expected to reach 164.5 billion yuan, a 25-percent 
increase over the previous year. The added value of industrial 
output is expected to reach 87 billion yuan, a 40-percent 
increase. Sales revenues of industrial enterprises at and above 
the township level that maintain independent accounting rose 52 
percent. Total retail sales reached 75.87 billion yuan, up 33.2 
percent. Industrial and commercial tax revenues reached 16.411 
billion yuan, a 50.6-percent increase. Of the total, 13.169 
billion yuan was from three types of industrial and commercial 
tax, up 59.4 percent. Second, it was because since the second 
half of 1993 departments at all levels in the province have 
seriously implemented the guidelines of Central Document No. 6. 
They reduced fiscal deficits; corrected unauthorized exemption 
and reduction of taxes, energy, transport construction, and 
budget regulatory funds; halted the approval of temporary 
exemption and reduction of taxes; and stopped loopholes that 
caused revenue losses. As a result, revenues had increased for 
the entire year. Third, it was because financial and tax 
departments enforced strict management of tax collection, 
strengthened tax auditing, sternly dealt with illegal acts of 
evading taxes and refusing to pay taxes by fraudulent means, and 
strengthened collection and management of taxes from individual 
businesses. In 1993, the province collected 2.23 billion yuan 
of taxes from individual businesses, a 39.5- percent increase. 
On the expenditure side, it was mainly because of factors 
closely related to policy implementation, such as increase in 
wages and cost of living allowances for workers following the 
lifting of controls on grain price, and the rapid increase of 
personnel expenditures. The province's administrative budget 
alone was 1.484 billion yuan, an increase of 0.41 billion yuan 
or 37.5 percent. In addition, various localities also tried 
their best to spend more in support of agricultural, scientific 
and technological, and educational development and in support of 
enterprise technological transformation and urban 
infrastructural construction. According to statistics, the 
province's budgetary expenditures on education last year reached 
2.269 billion yuan (including education funds and urban 
education surcharges), an increase of 0.549 billion, up 31.9 
percent, faster than the increase in general budgetary 
expenditure during the same period. Enterprises' expenditure in 
tapping potentials and technological transformation grew 0.439 
billion yuan, or 70.2 percent, over the previous year. 
  The province's 1993 revenues and expenditures budget was 
generally well implemented. On the revenue side, there were no 
violations discovered, such as collecting taxes excessively or 
"eating next year's food." On the expenditure side, various 
localities gave priority to key projects and emphasized overall 
balance, thereby pushing forward economic construction and 
social undertakings. Localities used increased revenues mainly 
to reduce fiscal deficits, increase productive expenditures, 
develop various undertakings, and cover necessary personnel 
expenditures. 
  In the past year, under the leadership of the local party 
committee and government, departments at all levels in the 
province deepened reform, opened up wider to the outside world, 
always gave priority to the work of accelerating economic 
development, worked hard to expand financial resources, and 
stepped up efforts to increase revenue and reduce expenditures. 
They did a tremendous amount of work to accomplish the 
province's budgetary goal and achieve balance between revenues 
and expenditures. 
  (1) Earnestly implementing the guidelines of Central 
Document No. 6 and strictly enforcing the "three covenants" to 
rectify financial and taxation orders.Since the second half 
of 1993, in accordance with the guidelines of Central Document 
No. 6 requiring local authorities not to create deficits in 
local budgets, various localities have achieved unity in 
thinking and understanding and produced remarkable results in 
overcoming and rectifying the erroneous idea that "deficits are 
harmless" and in adopting firm measures to increase revenues and 
reduce general fiscal expenditures. In the process of reducing 
fiscal deficits, people's congress standing committees at all 
levels strengthened supervision and guidance and performed a 
tremendous amount of work. They earnestly launched inspection 
of unauthorized exemptions and reductions of taxes, abolished 
certain preferential policies locally formulated in violation of 
rules, and corrected the erroneous practice of some localities 
that wailfully exempted or reduced the energy and transport 
construction funds and budget regulatory funds. They halted the 
approval of temporary exemption and reduction of taxes. As a 
result, the province's financial and taxation order moved 
further in the right direction. 
(2) Meticulously organizing forces to vigorously implement 
measures to push forward reform of the financial, taxation, and 
accounting systems. Since the beginning of last year, 
various localities have given priority to implementing the 
general rules and new financial and accounting systems for 
various industries. As time was short and the task onerous, 
departments at all levels assumed responsibility for themselves 
and cooperated with each other to carry out in a timely fashion 
the training of financial and taxation personnel in their own 
departments and in enterprises. They earnestly brought about the 
transition from the old accounting system to the new one and the 
change of books. This has ensured the smooth implementation of 
measures for reforming enterprises' accounting system. 
Regarding the implementation of the "Regulations on 
Transforming the Management Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial 
Enterprises," (hereinafter referred to as the "Regulations") and 
the "Implementing Measures" adopted by the province, various 
localities proceeded from reality and reformed the various 
financial regulations and rules incompatible with the 
"Regulations," truthfully delegating the financial 
decisionmaking power to enterprises as mandated by the 
"Regulations." To hold back the strong momentum in the rapid 
rise of budgets for public medical service, the province 
reformed the medical service system last year to reduce waste in 
public medical service. On the question of pushing forward 
financial and taxation system reform, first, we earnestly 
carried out experiments in financial reform of the tax-revenue 
sharing system. Acting in accordance with the uniform planning 
of the state and province, localities actively explored and 
accumulated experiences for the formal implementation of the 
tax- revenue sharing financial system. Second, since the second 
half of 1993, under the leadership of the local party committee 
and government, departments at all levels actively carried out 
preparatory work for reform in five major fields. They 
earnestly studied, analyzed, and measured the financial and tax 
reform and its impact on the economy, and they carried out 
propaganda and training for implementing the new tax system. 
Third, pursuant to the guidelines of the State Council 
"Decision on Implementing the Tax- Revenue-Sharing Financial 
Management System" and the principle of "standardization, 
convenience, and fairness" forwarded by the provincial 
government and after careful study and repeated measurement, a 
program for implementing the tax-revenue-sharing financial 
system at the city, prefectural, and county levels has been 
formulated. 
  Moreover, localities have also made useful explorations, 
and scored heartening progress, in the reform of the 
revenue-sharing, wage, shareholding, housing, and other systems. 
(3) Adopt positive measures to promote all-round 
development in the economy and endeavors in all other 
fields. In 1993, localities earnestly implemented relevant 
state policies and measures by providing vigorous support to 
development of new and high technologies and the construction of 
infrastructure facilities and basic industries. We encouraged 
the introduction of investment and advanced technologies from 
abroad, improved management of World Bank-funded projects and 
loans, and promoted the development of an open economy. We 
raised funds to increase agricultural input; promoted a 
high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture; 
accelerated the development of a network of collectivized 
services in rural areas; supported the development of village 
and township enterprises; and offered assistance to economic 
development in mountainous, island, and other poverty-ridden 
areas. In 1993, the province spent 840 million yuan to support 
agricultural production, up 39.9 percent over the previous year. 
Continued efforts were made to implement the policy designed to 
invigorate and improve the operations of state-owned large and 
medium enterprises. State-owned industrial enterprises covered 
by the budget set aside 581 million yuan from their sales income 
as technology development, supplementary working, and additional 
appreciation funds, up 137.1 percent over the previous year. 
Meanwhile, we tried every possible way to raise funds for 
enterprise technical upgrades. The provincial treasury raised 
210 million yuan to help fund key technical upgrade 
projects--including technical upgrading of silk mills and select 
village and township enterprises-- during the Eighth Five-Year 
Plan period [1991-96]. With focus on implementing the two sets 
of rules [Business Accounting Standards and General Rules of 
Financial Affairs for Enterprises] and the "Regulations," we 
helped enterprises upgrade internal management, implement 
measures aimed at making up deficits and increasing revenues, 
and improve economic efficiency. We continued to implement the 
policy and measures of "revitalizing the province by relying on 
science and technology and education," implemented reform of the 
educational and scientific and technological management systems, 
and expanded funding sources. More support was given to the 
development of science and technology, culture, education, 
public health, and other endeavors; expenditures on these 
endeavors covered in the 1993 provincial budget alone amounted 
to 3.927 million yuan, up 820 million, or 26.2 percent, over the 
previous year. 
(4) Improving tax collection, strictly controlling 
spending, and implementing well work related to increasing 
revenue and reducing spending. Localities stepped up 
auditing tax collection in an effort to improve tax collection 
and organize revenues well. Most of the cities and counties set 
up tax auditing forces and stepped up coordination among 
financial, taxation, public security, industrial and commercial 
administration, and judicial departments, and cracked down hard 
on illegal acts, such as evading or refusing to pay taxes. 
While paying close attention to collecting taxes from principal 
sources of tax revenues and major tax payers, the province 
conducted special tax auditing among self-employed industrial 
and commercial entities and privately run enterprises, 
recovering an additional 44.6 million in taxes. We stepped up 
tax collection among foreign-funded enterprises and launched a 
vigorous drive against tax evasion. In 1993, the province 
collected 819 million yuan in industrial and commercial 
consolidated taxes, up 557 million yuan, or 2.25 times, over 
1992. We improved invoice administration and cracked down on 
such illegal acts as illegal printing, counterfeiting, or sale 
and issuance of fake invoices. To exercise strict control over 
expenditures, localities improved expenditure administration and 
paid special attention to bringing administrative outlay and 
institutional purchase under control. A quota system that was 
widely introduced in regard to administrative outlay was 
effective in encouraging the departments and units to manage 
their finances well and produced fairly good results. 
Departments at all levels also implemented effective measures 
to cut down on meetings and reduce meeting-related spending, 
postal and telecommunications expenditures, and office equipment 
purchases. 
  (5) Enforcing financial and economic discipline and 
strengthening supervision and inspection of finance and 
taxation. In accordance with the State Council's unified 
arrangements, various localities earnestly carried out a general 
checkup on taxation and finance. By the end of last December, 
the province had uncovered 571 million yuan in 
discipline-violation monies, traced 424 million yuan in payable 
taxes, and recovered 356 million yuan in fiscal revenues. We 
also investigated and dealt with a number of serious and major 
cases; further strengthened state-owned property management; 
appraised fixed assets and circulating funds in administrative 
undertakings and units; and further strengthened supervision 
over the assessment and title-registration of state-owned 
property in Sino-foreign joint ventures, contractual joint 
ventures, and joint-stock enterprises, thus making important 
contributions to preventing the drain of state-owned property. 
We paid further attention to developing the undertakings of 
registered accountants and strengthened the development and 
administration of registered accountants and accounting firms. 
By the end of 1993, 129 accounting firms with a total of 1,220 
registered accountants had been set up across the province. We 
did earnest work in clearing illegal fees, particularly in 
exposing illegal-fee problems that drew strong criticisms from 
the masses. By the end of 1993, the province had announced the 
abolition of a number of fees that were inconsistent with 
stipulations by the central and provincial governments and 
sorted out and refunded unreasonably collected fees amounting to 
10.039 million yuan. 
  Of course, some problems that brook no ignorance remained in 
our work. First, there was inadequate awareness of the need to 
keep expenditures within the limits of income, act according to 
our capability, and strike an overall balance. Some cities and 
counties were very tight in disposing finances because their 
income growth had failed to keep up with growing expenditures. 
Second, there were a softening of budgetary restraint and lack 
of effective control over spending, with some departments and 
units spending money without much care or regard to cost 
effectiveness, and even frequently engaging in extravagance and 
waste. Individual localities still saw the diversion of funds 
for aiding the poor to other purposes. Third, some enterprises 
remained wanting in economic efficiency. By the end of 1993, 
398 state-owned industrial enterprises covered by the budget 
suffered losses totaling 450 million yuan and had net accounts 
receivable topping 5.25 billion yuan. Fourth, the methods of 
tax collection and administration still fell behind the needs of 
developing circumstances despite some improvement, leading to 
frequent occurrences of law violations such as tax evasion, 
violent tax refusal, and tax fraud. All these problems call for 
our great attention and earnest improvements in future work. 
<H5>  2. Draft Fiscal Budget for 1994 </H5>
  The year 1994 is important for continuously maintaining the 
favorable momentum of economic development as well as a crucial 
one for advancing the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. Determined in accordance with the economic 
development strategy determined by the provincial party 
committee and government and the focus of this year's provincial 
economic work and in conjunction with the overall requirement of 
fiscal reform, the guiding ideology for the provincial budgetary 
arrangements for 1994 is:Implement in depth the guidelines 
of the CPC 14th National Congress and the decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on issues 
concerning the establishment of a socialist market economic 
system; implement the guidelines of the ninth provincial party 
congress; earnestly and properly carry out financial and 
taxation reform; actively support all other reforms; adhere to 
the principle of keeping expenditures within the limits of 
income, acting according to our capability, and striking an 
overall balance; strengthen fiscal management; ensure that local 
finances will not run into the red; and work hard to foster 
finances and increase fiscal revenues to support economic 
construction and the development of various social 
undertakings. 
  According to the guiding principle set by the Zhejiang 
provincial authorities for this year's budget preparations and 
the province's economic planning targets, and based on the 
regulations governing the tax revenue sharing system, the 
province's fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02 
billion yuan, a 10.1-percent increase over the previous year 
(calculated using similar items [tong kou jing, 0681 0656 1777]; 
same for the following). The budgets of major revenues are: (1) 
industrial and commercial tax revenues (including the 25-percent 
value-added taxes [VAT]) are set at 6.57 billion yuan, up 8.3 
percent from the year before; (2) agricultural tax revenues are 
set at 570 million yuan (including taxes and other revenues from 
special agricultural products), a 12.1-increase percent over the 
previous year; (3) enterprise income taxes are set at 1.21 
billion yuan, same as the previous year; (4) revenue of energy 
and transportation funds is set at 30 million yuan, 67.4 percent 
less than the previous year; (5) revenue of budget regulation 
funds is set at 36 million yuan, 71.7 percent less than the 
previous year; (6) revenue of pollution fighting fees is set at 
120 million yuan, a 2.2-percent increase over the year before; 
(7) revenue of extra educational fees is set at 310 million 
yuan, up 12.5 percent from the year before; and (8) subsidies to 
cover state-owned enterprises' losses is set at 1.1 billion 
yuan, 25.4 percent less than the previous year. The province's 
fixed financial revenue for 1994 is projected at 8.02 billion 
yuan. Including the projected 5.2 billion yuan (excluding the 
5.06 billion yuan that is to be submitted to the central 
authorities according to the system) of tax revenue return from 
the central authorities and of the central authorities' 
subsidies for special projects, which is computed based on the 
province's 1993 revenue, the province's usable funds for 1994 is 
projected at 13.22 billion yuan. 
  According to the principle that no deficits are allowed to 
be 
included in local budgets, and to ensure that there will be 
sufficient funds for the province's 1994 expenditures, we plan 
to set the province's 1994 expenditure at 13.22 billion yuan, a 
5.9- percent increase over the previous year (calculated using 
similar items; same for the following). The budgets for major 
expenditures are: (1) expenditure for capital construction is 
set at 620 million yuan, 9.1 percent less than the year before; 
(2) expenditure for tapping enterprises' potentials and for 
their technological transformation is set at 790 million yuan, 
down 25.6 percent from the previous year; (3) expenditure for 
science and technological development is set at 240 million 
yuan, up 9.7 percent from the year before; (4) expenditure for 
agricultural development is set at 1.25 billion yuan, a 
9.7-percent increase from the year before, of which 830 million 
yuan is for supporting agricultural production, or 10 percent 
higher than the previous year; (5) expenditure for cultural, 
educational, and public health purposes is set at 4 billion 
yuan, 14.9 percent higher than the year before, of which 2.361 
billion yuan is for educational purposes, or 15.6 percent higher 
than the previous year; (6) administrative and management 
expenditure is set at 1.62 billion yuan, up 9.4 percent from the 
year before; (7) expenditure for public security, procuratorial, 
and judicial work is set at 650 million yuan, 13.5 percent 
higher than the year before; (8) expenditure for supporting 
development in underdeveloped areas is set at 53 million yuan, a 
5.3-percent increase over the previous year; and (9) extra 
educational expenditure is set at 250 million yuan, up 12 
percent from the year before. 
  In the draft provincial budget, provincial financial revenue 
for 1994 is projected at 450 million yuan, or 2.8 percent less 
than the previous year calculating using similar items. 
Including the projected 2.37 billion yuan of tax revenue return 
from the central authorities, of the central authorities' 
subsidies for special projects, and of funds submitted and 
transferred from all cities and counties, the usable provincial 
funds for 1994 is projected at 2.82 billion yuan. We plan to 
set provincial financial expenditure for 1994 at 2.82 billion 
yuan, or 7 percent more than the previous year calculating using 
similar items. 
  From the aforementioned budgeted financial revenues and 
expenditures, revenues are budgeted in a positive manner, 
expenditures are tight, and the revenues and expenditures 
budgets are balanced. However, due to various factors, the 
province's general financial situation in 1994 will still be 
tough and contradictions between the supply and demand of funds 
still will be quite prominent. The first reason is that, after 
the tax revenue sharing system is implemented, 75 percent of VAT 
and all consumption taxes will be submitted to the central 
authorities; in addition, we have to gradually increase the 
amount to be submitted, as required by the old system. The 
second reason concerns expenditures. We not only have to deal 
with the increased expenditures for wage adjustment, for 
subsidies to cover the differences resulting from the 
readjustments of coal and electricity prices, and for 
subsidizing housing reform, which are all a result of new 
policies adopted last year, there also will be many increased 
expenditures due to new policies to be implemented this year. 
Therefore, contradictions between revenue and expenditure will 
be even more acute this year and it will be more difficult to 
maintain a balance 
  In addition, since this is the first 
year to carry out new financial and taxation system, some 
concrete situations and problems need to be further investigated 
and studied. In terms of various policies and measures that 
have been or will be introduced, a process of transition and 
adaptation is needed for their actual operation. The financial 
and taxation work as a whole will face even more arduous tasks 
because new situations and problems will keep cropping up. Of 
course, we should also understand that there are quite a few 
favorable conditions. Our economic development, reform, and 
opening up are facing rare opportunities. First, since we have 
gradually carried out the central authorities' various measures 
concerning macroeconomic control, we have alleviated the 
contradiction between overall demand and supply and created even 
more favorable conditions for economic development. Second, 
with the progress of the financial, taxation, banking, 
investment, and foreign trade management systems, a socialist 
market economy will be further established and improved. Third, 
affected by the growth of investment, agricultural prices, and 
wages as well as other factors, market demand will continue a 
vigorous momentum. Zhejiang will continue to experience 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development and greater 
progress in reform, which in turn will provide better conditions 
for the financial and taxation work. Therefore, we should 
comprehensively and objectively analyze the current situation, 
unify thinking, enhance understanding, boost morale, foster 
faith, and strive to achieve financial balance. 
<H5>  3. The Key Points of the 1994 Financial Work </H5>
  To ensure that Zhejiang will have a balanced financial 
budget 
in 1994, we should further study and carry out the guiding 
spirit of the "Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some 
Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure" and that of the ninth provincial CPC 
congress, focus on the establishment of a socialist market 
economy and the key points of Zhejiang's 1994 economic work, and 
improve financial and taxation reform as well as reform in other 
aspects. To meet the need of a socialist market economy, we 
should accelerate the change of government functions, promote 
the development of economic and other aspects, enhance 
enterprises' economic performance, increase profits, and reduce 
expenditures. 
(1) Further promote sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
growth in Zhejiang by expanding financial resources and 
improving economic policy. Improving the economy and 
cultivating financial resources have always been the primary 
task of financial and taxation work. We should further stabilize 
the farming sector's status as the foundation of the national 
economy and carry out policies and measures concerning the 
promotion of agricultural production and rural economic 
development. We should actively support the establishment of a 
grain production risk foundation, grain reserve and control 
system, and reserve system for agricultural capital goods. It 
is necessary to support the readjustment of agricultural 
structure and promote a high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture. We should work hard to raise 
special funds for water conservancy projects and strive to 
enhance the economic performance of such funds. Continued 
efforts should be made to support economic development in 
mountain, island, and poverty-stricken areas. We should further 
expand channels for pooling funds and energetically support the 
construction of basic industries and infrastructure facilities, 
including transportation. It is necessary to support the 
construction and development of public utilities and public 
affairs undertakings. We should support the development of 
scientific and technological and educational undertakings by 
increasing capital input. We should help enterprises accelerate 
technical renovation, make up deficits and increase surpluses, 
strengthen market competition capability, and enhance economic 
performance. We should continue to raise funds to support the 
provincial government's technical renovation plans for major 
projects and the silk industry. We should strengthen the 
management of World Bank loans so as to increase their economic 
results. We should conscientiously carry out the state's 
relevant policies and regulations concerning financial and 
taxation matters and provide continued support to the economic 
development of various development zones and open cities. We 
should provide further support to the reform of the foreign 
trade system, strengthen financial supervision of foreign trade 
companies and foreign-funded enterprises, and strive to enhance 
Zhejiang's export and foreign-exchange earning ability. 
Meanwhile, we should take active measures to energetically 
support the development of tertiary industry. 
  (2) We should unify our thinking and effectively 
carry out various measures for reforming the financial and 
taxation systems.Reform of the financial and taxation 
systems is an important aspect in establishing a socialist 
market economic structure. We should understand the great 
significance of financial and tax reform from an overall and 
strategic point of view. We should carry out the reform of the 
financial and taxation systems as the central task of this 
year's financial and tax work; we should carefully organize this 
work, make proper arrangements for it, and conscientiously 
perform it. We should earnestly study new situations and 
problems arising in the course of reform and particularly study 
the possible impact of the financial and tax reform on economic 
development. As for problems arising in the process of 
replacing the old structure with a new one, we should deal with 
different problems in different ways. Problems which fall 
within the powers and functions of the provincial government 
should be studied and handled promptly and properly by the 
provincial government. As for problems that fall within the 
central authorities' powers and functions, we should report them 
to higher levels to have them solved as soon as possible. We 
should vigorously support reform in banking, investment, foreign 
exchange, and other fields; support and participate in the 
reform of the social security and urban housing systems; and 
support the experiment on the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system. We should continue to implement in an 
all-round way the "Regulations" and the procedures the 
provincial government adopted for carrying out the "Regulations." 
  The plan for the revenue-sharing system for the province, 
cities, prefectures, and counties, which was appropriately 
revised after being discussed at a provincial economic work 
conference and listening to the opinions of various localities, 
has been formally issued for implementation. Acting in the 
spirit of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from arousing 
local governments' initiative in developing the economy and 
increasing financial revenues, the provincial government will 
earnestly handle the interrelations between the province, 
cities, prefectures, and counties to further promote a 
coordinated development of the province's economy. The 
provincial government will concentrate an appropriate proportion 
of the increased financial revenues on certain projects -- this 
is an objective requirement for the provincial government to 
increase its ability to exercise macroeconomic regulation and 
control and to maintain the province's coordinated economic and 
social development. Conscientious efforts should be made to 
perform ideological work, to promote coordinated development in 
various parts of the province, to concentrate on economic 
construction, and to make financial revenues steadily increase 
with economic development. 
(3) We should accelerate the change of functions in 
finance and taxation to meet the needs of the market 
economy.How to do financial and tax work well under the 
socialist market economy is a new task before us. According to 
the requirements of the changing situation, we should further 
emancipate our minds, change our ideas, and step up our study of 
the market economy theory. We should conscientiously explore 
and study concepts and methods of managing money matters in the 
new situation. The stress of financial and tax work should be 
shifted as soon as possible to macroeconomic regulation and 
control as well as supervision and management. We should open 
up the field of financial investment, develop the negotiable 
securities trade, strengthen the management of funds for public 
housing, and further strengthen supervision and control over 
extra-budgetary funds to prevent the loss of such funds. We 
should quickly readjust the economic development strategy 
according to the change in the distribution of financial 
resources, strive to bring about economic growth, and try to 
increase financial revenues for local governments. We should 
quickly institute a local tax system and lose no time in 
studying the levying and management of taxes on earnings from 
the transfer of land leases and real estate and of inheritance 
and bequest taxes. We should further strengthen the management 
of state-owned assets and set up a social supervision network in 
this regard. Continuous efforts should be made to appraise the 
fixed assets and circulating funds, define property rights, and 
check up on creditor's rights and debts and on the value of 
enterprises' assets. We should do a good job in registering 
state-owned assets, strengthen the management of Chinese-owned 
shares of joint ventures practicing the share-holding system, 
prevent the loss of state-owned assets, and effectively ensure 
that state-owned assets and their rights and interests are not 
infringed on. We should further step up the study, publicity, 
and implementation of the "Law on Registered Accountants," 
strengthen the ranks of registered accountants and the 
management of their offices, and continuously develop their work 
to meet the needs of the developing socialist market economy. 
  (4) We must intensify tax collection and management 
and make great efforts to bring in more revenue.This year 
is the first for implementation of the new tax system and for 
the revenue-sharing system to operate. We must collect taxes 
strictly in accordance with the new tax law. We must continue 
to tighten the collection of the "two funds" [fund for priority 
energy and communications projects and fund for regulating the 
budget] from enterprises and institutions not operated by the 
state. These funds may not be deducted or exempted at will. We 
must continue to reform tax collection and management and make 
greater efforts in building contingents of competent tax 
auditors so that the ranks of auditors can be reinforced and tax 
collection and management can be strengthened. We must tighten 
the work of collecting taxes from independent business 
operators, private enterprises, and foreign-funded enterprises 
and we must audit their tax payments. We must tighten the 
management of invoices and draw up the necessary regulations and 
rules. Effective measures must be devised to heighten people's 
awareness of paying taxes, gradually establish and improve the 
system of tax payers filing taxes on their own initiative, 
actively promote taxation agency services, and promote the use 
of computers in tax collection and management. Harsh measures 
should be taken to crack down on all types of unlawful conduct 
of evading and refusing tax payments and all tax frauds. We 
must stop all revenue loopholes and firmly collect what should 
be collected. 
(5) We must tighten expenditure and strictly control 
expenses. We must continue to uphold the principle of 
spending within our means and doing what is within our ability, 
be stringent in earmarking funds, ensure the needs of priority 
projects, and curtail allotments for ordinary projects. Budgets 
for essential personnel must be ensured. Budget restraints must 
be firmly enforced, projects must be carried out strictly 
according to available budgets, and any casual or reckless 
spending habits must be combated and corrected. The procedures 
of setting administrative budget quotas should be further 
reviewed and improved. This year's budget-cutting should focus 
on expenses for meetings, postage, telegrams, and utilities. 
Institutions should speed up the restructuring of their fiscal 
management, and those that have the needed resources should be 
supported to provide compensatory services within the bounds of 
law so that their capacity for self-development will be stronger 
as result of their efforts to bring in additional income for 
themselves. The "accounting of revenues and expenditures must 
be done separately" rule must be enforced, and controls over all 
budgetary incomes must be consolidated. Grain-related finances 
must be tightened to make sure that there will not be any new 
debts incurred in this area this year. We must earnestly study 
measures for tightening control over institutional purchases 
under the new situation and make every effort to stop 
institutional consumption from ballooning.

<F P=106> [Excerpts from the Zhejiang Provincial People's Higher </F>
Court's work report delivered by Xia Zhonglie, president of the 
higher court, to the Second Session of the Eighth Zhejiang 
Provincial People's Congress on 2 March 1994] 
  [Text] In 1993, under the leadership of party committees 
at various levels and under the supervision and guidance of 
people's congresses at various levels and their standing 
committees as well as the Supreme People's Court, people's 
courts at various levels in the province seriously implemented 
the resolution of the First Session of the Eighth Zhejiang 
Provincial People's Congress on the provincial people's higher 
court's work report, centered their work on promoting economic 
construction, carried out various adjudicatory work, enforced 
law in a strict manner, strengthened the ranks of judicial 
workers, and made progress in various tasks. During the whole 
year, various people's courts concluded the trials of 137,983 
cases of various types, a 4.7 percent increase over the previous 
year, and the number of cases not yet concluded was 18.2 percent 
less than those in the previous year. They gave full play to 
the functions of judicial organs and played quite a good role in 
safeguarding social and political stability, in promoting 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, and in 
intensifying the anticorruption struggle. 
  In the past year, we took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guiding 
ideology; considered the implementation of the party's basic 
line of "one central task and two basic points" as the 
fundamental task; based ourselves on emancipating our minds and 
seeking truth from facts in carrying out judicial work; enforced 
law in a strict and serious manner; correctly handled relations 
between adjudication and service, between striking at law 
offenders and adjusting various policies, and between handling 
various cases according to the law and being "conducive to the 
three causes, namely conducive to developing the productive 
forces of our socialist society, increasing the overall strength 
of our socialist country, and improving the people's living 
standards;" raised the level of judicial work; and strived to 
protect reform, opening up, and the modernization drive, and to 
provide legal services. In our work arrangements, we 
concentrated on the three major things put forward by the party 
Central Committee, namely strengthening macrocontrol of the 
economy, opposing corruption, and safeguarding social stability. 
We actively unfolded adjudicatory work; placed the struggle and 
"hitting hard" against law offenders and the trial of major and 
serious cases, especial major economic crimes, in the first 
place; and ensured the smooth implementation of major policy 
decisions by the central authorities. While doing a good job in 
adjudicatory work, we paid attention to the building of judicial 
workers, conducted a massive investigation on law enforcement 
and discipline against corruption, consciously accepted the 
evaluation and judgment of our work by the people's congresses, 
conscientiously improved our work, constantly promoted the 
purity and enhanced the fighting ability of judicial workers, 
and guaranteed the accomplishment of our adjudicatory work. 
  In the past year, people's courts at various levels in the 
province have strengthened leadership in accordance with the 
above-mentioned general ideology and arrangements, adopted 
various measures, and stressed the following tasks: 
1. Strengthened the Intensity of Dealing Blows to Serious 
Criminal Law Offenders, Safeguarded Social Stability 
  The good or bad public order in society directly influences 
the overall situation of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. To safeguard stability in the society, people's 
courts in the whole province adhered to the policy of "dealing 
heavy blows to crimes," and punished criminal law offenders who 
killed people or committed crimes of robbery, rape, hooligan 
activities, and explosion, and crime groups with Mafia-like 
tendencies. In the whole year, various people's courts 
concluded the trial of 18,857 cases of the first instance, 
increasing by 16 percent as compared with the previous year. 
Those who were sentenced from five years' fixed-term 
imprisonment to life imprisonment or death accounted for 50.3 
percent, increasing by 2 percent as compared with the previous 
year. 
  Last May, the provincial party committee launched a 
campaign to crack down hard on gangs of criminals, the abduction 
of women and children, and "train and road bandits," and 
strictly enforce the ban on prostitution. The provincial court 
promptly worked out special plans in regard to the targets, 
methods, steps, and specific measures of the crackdown. Courts 
at all levels swung into immediate action; some courts set up 
special leading groups and 47 courts appointed 162 additional 
judges to reinforce their manpower. The broad ranks of cadres 
and policemen worked overtime to handle the numerous indictments 
resulting from the drive against crimes. In regard to vicious 
cases that pose a great harm to society and which the people 
detest most, the courts concerned moved them up and assigned 
personnel to try them quickly, render severe sentences, and give 
them wide publicity, thus effectively curbing the arrogance of 
criminals. 
2. Severely Punish Serious Economic Crimes and Implement 
the Anticorruption Drive. 
  Courts in Zhejiang underwent two phases in their handling of 
economic crimes last year. In contrary with the rampant 
economic crimes in society, the number of economic crime cases 
in the first half of 1993 dropped by 42.3 percent from the same 
1992 period. In the second half, pursuant with a directive of 
the CPC Central Committee calling for stepped-up efforts in 
investigating and prosecuting a number of major cases, courts 
and procuratorial and judicial organs in the province redoubled 
efforts in trying economic crime cases. A meeting of presidents 
of intermediate courts sponsored by the provincial court last 
August called for cracking down particularly hard on state 
functionaries in party and government organs, judicial organs, 
law-enforcing administrative departments, and departments in 
charge of economic administration who take advantage of their 
positions to embezzle, take bribes, and misappropriate public 
funds. The meeting also called for firmly cracking down on 
crimes such as production and sale of fake and shoddy goods, 
smuggling, sale of contraband goods, fraud, tax evasion, and 
refusal to pay tax. The meeting urged leadership of courts at 
all levels to take personal charge of trials involving major 
cases, step up supervision and guidance, and establish a system 
of recording and reporting major cases. On two occasions in 
September and November, the provincial court outlined plans for 
speeding up trials involving embezzlement and bribery, notifying 
the courts concerned about cases already indicted or soon to be 
indicted by the procuratorial organs. Courts throughout the 
province earnestly implemented the meeting's guidelines . Many 
courts also set up collegial panels or designated backbone 
cadres to take exclusive charge of the trials. By the end of 
last year, the province completed proceedings at first instance 
of 2,602 cases; of them, the number of cases completed and 
criminals sentenced in the second half of 1993 rose 55.4 and 
42.5 percent, respectively, over the first half. 
  From the economic criminals tried last year, we can see 
that there were several characteristics: First, state workers 
of party, government, judicial, administrative, and law 
enforcement organs--354 in total--accounted for 10 percent of 
these criminals, which is quite high. Second, many cases 
involved large amounts of money--198 criminals had illegal gains 
of more than 30,000 yuan, of which 71 gained more than 100,000 
yuan--and some cases were the first ones of their kind in 
Zhejiang. Third, cases involving manufacturing and selling fake 
and shoddy products and counterfeiting trade marks increased--84 
persons were sentenced for committing such crimes. Fourth, 
criminals given heavy sentences increased--279 persons, 22.9 
percent more than the previous year, were sentenced to 10 years 
or more in prison, of which 13 were sentenced to death and 28 
were given a temporary suspension of their death sentences. The 
severe punishment for serious economic criminals indicates the 
party and state's firm determination to fight corruption; it 
helped maintain the economic order and lift people's spirits. 
3. Forcefully Stepped Up Economic Trial To Improve 
Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and To Advance the Market 
Economy 
  Last year, the number of cases involving economic disputes 
increased sharply. There were many cases in which lawsuits 
involved several million yuan or tens of millions of yuan, and 
in which enterprises involved were on the verge of bankruptcy 
because they were unable to collect due payments. Cases 
involving disputes over purchase and marketing contracts 
increased noticeably, and cases with new characteristics also 
increased. To meet the needs of developing the market economy, 
courts across the province regarded the trial of economic cases 
as important work--they strengthened leadership, adjusted trial 
personnel, enhanced their trying capabilities, made trial 
process more regularized, and strived to improve the quality and 
efficiency of case handling. Last year, we handled and closed 
42,902 cases involving economic disputes after the first trial 
and settled disputes involving a total of 2.9 billion yuan, 
respectively 23.2 percent and 151.5 percent more than the 
previous year. 
  Courts at all levels conducted trials of economic cases, 
closely revolving around strengthening macroeconomic regulation 
and control, deepening reform of the economic system, and 
developing the socialist market economy. In addition to 
handling more cases properly and efficiently, they endeavored to 
expand their services and offered to serve economic construction 
and to solve problems for enterprises. They took positive 
measures to support efforts to straighten out the financial 
order and offered to collect overdue loans for creditors. They 
went to financial departments to understand the actual 
situations and then drew up appropriate measures--writing 
letters to urge debtors to pay or sending people to debtors to 
persuade them to pay--to collect overdue loans. By taking these 
measures, they collected 563 million yuan of overdue loans, 
relaxing some financial department's shortages of funds. They 
also provided more services to help enterprises free themselves 
from predicaments. Many courts did not wait for cases to be 
referred to them; instead, they took the initiative in 
understanding enterprises' operations through economic judicial 
liaison officers or by sending someone to enterprises concerned. 
They did their best to provide legal assistance to enterprises 
with difficulties. Courts at all levels also established 
economic disputes mediation centers. According to the 
guidelines of the 16th national conference of court presidents, 
eight intermediate courts and 59 grass-roots courts in the 
province established economic disputes mediation centers. 
Following the principle of being "voluntary, fair, legal, and 
efficient," these mediation centers settled 4,145 economic 
disputes cases and settled disputes involving 330 million yuan. 
It took an average of 13 days to settle a case--some cases were 
settled on the same day--keeping pace with the quick step of 
market economic development and winning concerned parties' 
welcome. 
  While the old system is being transformed into a new one, 
cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, credit cards, 
futures trade, and other new problems continued to crop up. 
Sometimes there were no laws for trying such cases or the laws 
are not specific enough, making trial work very difficult. 
Courts handling such cases insisted on the principle of seeking 
truth from facts, boldly sought new ways of practice, and 
conducted trial work prudently and in accordance with the civil 
procedural law, enabling them to achieve good social results. 
  4. Carried Out Various Judicial Work in an All-Round 
Manner and Gave Full Play to the Regulatory Function of the Law. 
  The trials of civil lawsuits are closely related to the 
production and lives of the masses. Civil litigations surpass 
all other lawsuits in terms of the number of cases, number of 
categories, and scope of work. Following the continual 
deepening of reform and opening up to the outside world, civil 
contacts have become increasingly extensive, giving rise to a 
constant increase in new kinds of civil lawsuits directly linked 
to the market economy such as labor disputes and labor 
remuneration and copyright cases. Last year we accepted and 
heard 575 cases under these three categories. The vast number 
of judicial personnel handling civil cases persisted in doing 
meticulous work, emphasizing mediation, and properly handling 
cases, regardless of whether they belonged to the major 
categories of marriage, debts, and compensatory damages, or to 
the new categories. Last year we concluded 63,634 civil cases 
during their first trial, 49.6 percent of which were settled 
through mediation, playing an active role in protecting the 
legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons in 
accordance with the law, maintaining social stability and unity, 
and promoting spiritual and material civilization. 
  Last year, under the situation of a decreasing number of 
administrative cases closed and growing difficulty in trying 
cases, courts at all levels overcame the fear for difficulty, 
held off various interferences, and persisted in handling cases 
in accordance with the law to settle 1,270 administrative cases. 
Administrative organs' punitive decisions were upheld in 354 
cases, or 27.9 percent of the total, and annulled or revised in 
220 cases, or 17.3 percent; nolle prosequi took place in 602 
cases, or 47.4 percent; the suitor's claim was rejected and the 
trial terminated in 94 cases, or 7.4 percent. As such, we not 
only protected the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, 
legal persons, and other organizations in accordance with the 
law, but also supported administrative organs in exercising 
their functions and powers. In our work, we laid stress on 
administrative cases involving infringement upon enterprises' 
property rights and operational and management powers, land, and 
urban planning, concluding a total of 306 cases under these four 
categories. Through the administration of justice in accordance 
with the law, we promoted the transformation of enterprise 
operating mechanisms and safeguarded the smooth progress of old 
town reconstructions and development zone constructions at 
various localities. 
  In the first year after its establishment, the Ningbo 
Admiralty Court developed the spirit of building an undertaking 
through arduous effort, made bold attempts, and enthusiastically 
carried out judicial work. It accepted and heard 103 maritime 
cases of various kinds, and concluded 78 of them. It put an end 
to the history that maritime cases taking place in the Zhejiang 
waters had to be referred to courts outside the province, and is 
playing an active role in helping develop our maritime 
transportation, fishery production, and foreign trade. 
  Over the past year, courts in Zhejiang at all levels 
actively participated in the overall improvement of public 
security and order through conducting trials. In focusing on 
open trials to promote the awareness of the legal system, the 
courts held 504 public sentencing meetings at which 3,441 people 
were given sentences. To achieve a better effect, the courts 
used the media to explain the laws involved in each case. A 
total of 2,075 people were given probation, but their behavior 
was routinely checked to enforce their disciplinary control. We 
actively launched a suggestion campaign. A total of 1,058 
suggestions concerning judicial affairs were passed to the 
relevant departments. Of these, 70 percent were adopted. As a 
result, we achieved fairly good social effects. We attached 
great importance to out-of-court settlements and succeeded in 
preventing from happening more than 1,700 possible suicides, 
murders, and fighting caused by civil disputes. 
5. Uphold the Principle of Tightening Law Enforcement and 
Increasing the Level of Judicial Work 
  Tightening law enforcement is the state's fundamental 
requirement for judicial work. It is also a matter of great 
concern for the people. In their trial work, courts at all 
levels persisted in handling their affairs strictly in 
accordance with the law, and they strived to improve the quality 
of their case handling. The courts tried to improve the 
quality, efficiency, and social effects of their work. First, 
they persisted in holding public trials and in improving the 
quality of trial work. They paid great attention to three 
important links in trial work: investigation, cross- 
examination, and debate. They attached importance to evidence 
provided by the parties concerned and brought into full play the 
role of the collegial bench. Second, they strengthened trial 
supervision and work guidance. If appeals were rational, trial 
corrections were rendered in a timely fashion. Last year, 272 
past legal cases were given retrials. A total of 84 cases 
appealed by procuratorial organizations were handled. Of these, 
27 cases were given a retrial. Third, they began to experiment 
with a system in which persons responsible for wrong cases 
should be uncovered and punished. Four intermediate courts and 
44 grass-roots courts have already established such a system. 
Cadres and police who were responsible for wrong cases were 
given suitable punishments. This measure helped judges to 
foster a serious and conscientious trial work style and to 
enhance their sense of responsibility. Fourth, the courts 
explored ways to improve trial work. In conducting trials of 
economic and civil cases, the courts emphasized the relevant 
parties' responsibility for providing evidence. The courts 
introduced a standardized trial system in which all cases will 
be handled promptly. After summing up trial experiences gained 
by localities, the provincial people's courts have already 
formulated standardized regulations concerning the trials for 
economic cases. Such regulations--which concern standards of 
quality, trial procedures, detailed regulations for convening a 
court, and evidence provided by the parties concerned--played a 
fairly important role in improving the level of trials. 
  Second, they strengthened the training of cadres and took 
steps to improve the professional skills of trial personnel. In 
recent years, new laws and regulations have been promulgated one 
after another, and new developments and problems have popped up 
in trials. In addition, some comrades who became court 
presidents following last year's expiration of terms were 
unfamiliar with the practice of their professional work. In 
light of this, courts at all levels stepped up their training, 
held seminars to familiarize them with their jobs, and sponsored 
meetings to exchange trial experience. Provincial courts 
sponsored training classes for presiding judges of criminal, 
civil, and appeal courts and organized two-month-long in-service 
training sessions for 25 grass-roots court presidents. These 
training and job-related activities have helped improve the 
ability of key members of the trial cadres to resolve problems 
and have played a positive role in raising judicial standards 
and ensuring good qualities in handling cases. 
  Third, they earnestly carried out the struggle against 
corruption. Emphasis was placed on court leaders' taking the 
lead in maintaining honesty and exercising self-discipline and 
on establishing a system for leading cadres to take 
responsibility in building party style. At the same time, 
vigorous efforts were made to carry out the following two tasks. 
First, efforts were made to resolutely stop the unhealthy 
practice of using judicial authority to wantonly collect fees 
under all sorts of names. Court offices which caused confusion 
in terms of judicial and administrative powers were abrogated. 
Second, a general inspection on law and discipline enforcement, 
with a special emphasis on corruption, was launched. Various 
methods were adopted--including internal investigations, 
soliciting views from the departments concerned, and studying 
cases with a clear objective in mind--to find out whether there 
were abuses of power for personal gain and unfair verdicts. The 
general inspection showed that the overwhelming majority of 
cadres and police officers had faithfully enforced the law. The 
courts concerned dealt sternly with 27 cases of the violation of 
law and discipline discovered in the course of inspections. The 
courts used these violations as negative examples to educate 
cadres and police officers and as warning to them. This has 
promoted honest and clean government. 
  There were still many problems and difficulties in our work 
during the past year. The main problems and difficulties were 
as follows: First, the thinking and awareness of the cadres and 
police officers fell behind political and economic developments. 
A few of them were not very conscientious about serving 
economic construction. Old ideas formed over a long period in a 
planned economy still exerted influences to varying degrees. 
There were still instances of approaching cases in isolation 
without paying attention to their social effect. Second, there 
were still instances of a failure to enforce the law strictly. 
A small number of cases were handled poorly, and some cases 
were not handled strictly according to legal procedures. Some 
cases were not handled within the prescribed time, and some 
major cases were not handled promptly. As a result, the social 
effects of these cases were decreased. There were also 
instances of a lack of strong measures against serious criminal 
elements in trial procedures. Third, the environment for law 
enforcement was not quite satisfactory. Some cadres were 
partial to and pleaded for mercy for one party. Some even used 
their authority to override the law and interfere in trials. 
Because of strong local protectionism, cases involving people 
outside the locality were difficult to handle; and the execution 
of court judgments was even more difficult. Little progress was 
made in the trial of administrative cases; the number of cases 
concluded dropped 11 percent compared to the previous year. 
Fourth, there were too many cases and very few personnel to 
handle them. Equipment was obsolete, and many courts 
experienced shortages of funds to handle cases. This affected 
the smooth progress of trials. The provincial court lacked the 
in-depth investigation and study of new developments and 
characteristics emerging in the new situation. It also failed 
to give prompt guidance and to exercise effective supervision 
over trials. It lacked solutions to certain problems. We are 
adopting measures to vigorous solve all these problems and 
difficulties, and we have asked the provincial people's congress 
and its standing committee to give us their support and to urge 
the departments concerned to help solve them. 
  The execution of court judgments is an important part of 
strictly enforcing the law. To effectively protect citizens' 
lawful rights and to maintain the authority of court verdicts 
and the solemn nature of the law, people's courts at various 
levels paid attention to executing court verdicts. They 
overcame and resisted local protectionism and made efforts to 
execute court verdicts in a civilized manner in various ways by 
integrating routine efforts with special efforts to carry out 
court orders and by entrusting the departments concerned to 
execute court verdicts. During the past year, various people's 
courts executed a total of 43,123 cases of verdicts of various 
types, and the number of cases not yet executed decreased by 
11.4 percent compared to the previous year. To solve the 
problem of "difficulties in executing court orders," the 
provincial higher court seriously studied and formulated 
"opinions on solving some specific problems in the execution of 
court verdicts," "rules for the implementation of court 
verdicts," and "opinions on how to reach desired goals in 
executing court verdicts" to guide and promote the execution of 
court decisions by people's courts at the lower level. 
  In the second half of last year, people's courts at various 
levels adopted a serious attitude in voluntarily accepting 
evaluations and comments from people's deputies in accordance 
with the circular issued by the standing committee of the 
provincial people's congress on evaluating judicial work. 
Various people's courts made full preparations beforehand for 
accepting evaluations from people's deputies. While carrying 
out self-checks, various people's courts heard opinions and 
suggestions on court work from peoples from various circles of 
society by visiting people or by inviting people to express 
their opinions and suggestions. Fifty-two people's courts sent 
letters to solicit opinions from 9,359 people's deputies at 
various levels; 61 people's courts invited 4,248 people's 
deputies and supervisors of the honesty of government work and 
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference to take part in discussions at courts; and 74 
people's courts went deep into villages and towns to solicit 
opinions. Concerned courts conducted investigations one by one 
on opinions and criticisms made by people's deputies and 
seriously studied ways to make improvements. Through these 
activities, the broad masses of cadres and judicial policemen of 
various courts have further understood that commenting on and 
evaluating judicial work is an effective way for the courts to 
accept supervision from the people's congresses and also an 
important way to gain the understanding of people's deputies and 
to ensure the strict enforcement of the law. 
6. Lay Stress on Opposing Corruption and Advocating 
Honesty in Performing Official Duties, Strengthen the Building 
of People's Courts 
  Over the past year, people's courts at various levels paid 
attention to the building of judicial workers while attaching 
importance to adjudicatory work. People's courts strived to 
raise the political and professional quality of judicial workers 
to guarantee the accomplishment of various adjudicatory tasks. 
  First, various people's courts have attached importance to 
study and education for judicial cadres and policemen to raise 
their political quality. In light of the problem of ideological 
understanding in the transitional period from the old system to 
the new system and the change of relations concerning material 
interests in the new period, various people's courts have 
strengthened education and guidance for cadres and policemen. 
Judicial cadres and policemen were organized to study the basic 
theory of Marxism, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee. The people's courts armed 
cadres and policemen with the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to raise their consciousness of 
implementing the party's basic line. Various courts also 
conducted education on ideals, moral principles, and discipline, 
and they encouraged cadres and policemen to carry forward the 
spirit of dedication. The overwhelming majority of cadres and 
policemen have been honest in performing their official duties 
and have strived to make improvements. A large number of 
advanced units and individuals who adhere to principles and who 
enforce the law justly have emerged. In 1993, 71 collectives 
and 153 individuals won praise and received awards. Of these, 
the Zhouquan People's Court in Tongxiang city was accorded a 
collective merit first class by the Supreme People's Court, and 
Deputy Presiding Judge Dong Youquan of the economic affairs 
court of the Shaoxing County People's Court and staff member Li 
Yuanqing of the Jinhua Intermediate People's Court archives were 
named national models for court workers. 
  The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
proposed to preliminarily establish the socialist market economy 
by the end of this century. This is a crucial year for pushing 
through overall progress and attaining key breakthroughs in 
economic restructuring. Now we are faced with arduous tasks in 
maintaining public security. As the state's judicial organ, the 
people's courts will shoulder heavier tasks and greater 
responsibilities. In accordance with the guidelines of the 
ninth provincial party congress and the national conference of 
higher court presidents, the guiding ideology for judicial work 
throughout the province this year is:To use Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee as a guide; to hold court 
trials comprehensively and uphold the principle of striking 
severely at large and major crimes; to vigorously use judicial 
means to regulate relations between various economic sectors; to 
strengthen self-construction; to uphold strict and just law 
enforcement; to strive to improve judicial standards; as well as 
to provide legal support and services to the overall task of 
"seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability."Thus, we 
will focus on carrying out the following work: 
  First, it is necessary to strengthen the functions of 
dictatorship, to punish resolutely and strictly in accordance 
with the law criminals who endanger national security, and to 
uphold the principle of punishing serious criminal offenders 
severely and promptly.To further carry on last year's work 
in strictly cracking down on crimes, it is necessary to strike 
at the crimes of murder, robbery, rape, gangsterism, drug 
trafficking, and kidnapping and selling women and children, 
particularly the crimes of secret gangster organizations. 
Further, we must crack down on prominent crimes in accordance 
with the characteristics of localities. Courts should actively 
coordinate with the relevant departments to effectively curb and 
rectify special crimes. It is necessary to quicken the pace of 
case handling, trials, and handing down sentences to uphold the 
courts' authority in curbing crimes and to widen the social 
effects of the courts' work. While striking severely at crimes, 
it is necessary to actively participate in the comprehensive 
rectification of public order, as well as to bring into further 
play the courts' role in holding public trials, offering 
suggestions in judicial matters, publicizing the legal system, 
and offering guidance and arbitration. 
  Second, it is necessary to continue to crack down 
severely on serious economic crimes to promote a clean 
government. We must do a good job of holding trials for 
major economic crimes. We must strictly crack down on state 
personnel who use their powers for corruption, bribery, and to 
embezzle public funds. We must resolutely curb the crimes of 
smuggling, swindling, producing and selling fake and 
inferior-quality goods, and tax evasion. Court leaders must 
personally handle major cases uncovered during the 
anticorruption struggle and attend to them seriously once trials 
are held. It is necessary to be determined, careful, and 
accurate in handing down strict punishments in accordance with 
the law. We must resolutely mete out heavy or death sentences 
when essential. It is necessary to publicize typical cases that 
generally concern and affect society by holding open trials, 
passing sentences in public, or holding news conferences to 
widen the social effects of cases' handling by the courts. 
  Third, We Should Further Consolidate and Regulate 
Courts' Functions To Advance the Development of the Socialist 
Market Economy.This year, the reform of the economic system 
will accelerate; therefore, all courts should make full use of 
judicial means to help nurture and develop the market system. 
We should seriously enforce the "Economic Contract Law," the 
"Company Law," the "Law on Protecting Consumers' Rights and 
Interests," and the "Law on Unfair Competition," to ensure open, 
fair, and orderly competition and to prohibit unfair 
competition. We should enthusiastically handle and properly 
settle cases involving financial management, resources 
exploitation, tax levying and management, and price management, 
to ensure that reform is carried out smoothly. By trying cases 
involving problems coming up in the course of transforming 
enterprises' operating mechanisms, we should safeguard 
enterprises' rights to operate and manage their own operations 
and should uphold enterprises' internal contract responsibility 
system on business management so that enterprises can truly be 
independent economic entities and be major players in market 
competition. We should properly try cases involving village and 
town enterprises' contract disputes over production and business 
operation matters to advance the development of village and town 
enterprises. At the same time, we should try carefully and 
properly cases involving bankruptcy, company shares, futures 
trading, and other new problems which come up while reform is 
being deepened, as well as cases involving matters concerning 
foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, in order to 
create a good legal environment for deepening reform and opening 
up to the outside world. 
  Fourth, We Should Tighten Supervision Over Trial Cases 
To Uphold the Dignity of the Law.Currently, courts' trial 
work is quite seriously disturbed by regional and departmental 
protectionism--trials in a small number of cases have dragged 
on, and court rulings were unfair. So, we must further 
emphasize the need to strictly enforce the law, to tighten 
supervision over trial work, and to enhance trial discipline. 
In addition to carrying out education in adhering to the goal 
of wholeheartedly serving the people and to stepping up 
vocational training, we should improve the supervision and 
inhibition mechanisms, continue on a trial basis the system of 
investigating wrongly ruled cases, and affix administrative and 
legal responsibility for persons handling cases illegally. We 
should decidedly correct unfair rulings and wrongful law 
enforcement. At the same time, we should further strengthen law 
enforcement, reinforce and better equip our law-enforcement 
personnel, decidedly get over the disturbance of regional 
protectionism, emphasize enforcing the law in a civilized 
manner, and uphold the seriousness of the law. 
Fifth, We Should Deepen Court Reform and Improve Court 
Work. First, we should step up the study of political 
theory, especially Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee; further emancipate our minds; change 
the way we think; and enhance our resolution and 
self-consciousness in carrying out the party's basic line and 
the policy of developing a socialist market economy. Second, we 
should carry out the anticorruption struggle in depth and make 
constant efforts to promote administrative honesty, in order to 
enable cadres and policemen to withstand the trials and pounding 
of the commodity economy. Third, we should build up our leading 
bodies, improve administrative work, and strictly manage the 
courts. At the same time, we should actively seek ways to reform 
our trial procedures--in trying civil and economic cases, we 
should emphasize the concerned parties' responsibility in 
testifying. We also should improve courts' trial capabilities, 
improve case-handling efficiency, ensure that all cases are 
handled properly, and continue to build up the civil and 
economic divisions and to improve these divisions' material 
conditions, in order to carry out heavy trial work. 
Sixth, We Should Be More Party-Minded and Should 
Self-Consciously Subject Ourselves to the Supervision of the 
People's Congresses.Relying closely on the party's 
leadership and the masses and self-consciously subjecting 
ourselves to the supervision of the people's congresses are the 
fundamental assurance for the people's courts to properly 
conduct their trial work. Courts at all levels should 
voluntarily and in a timely manner submit reports to the party 
committee and the people's congress in charge concerning their 
work plans and new situations and problems in their work, and 
they should suggest ways to deal with these new situations and 
problems. They should follow the party committees' instructions 
and subject themselves to the supervision of their people's 
congress. They should resolutely carry out relevant resolutions 
adopted by their people's congress and its standing committee 
and handle earnestly and in a responsible manner matters 
committed to them by their people's congress and its standing 
committee. At the same time, they should subject themselves to 
procuratorial organs' legal supervision and the media's 
supervision so that they can continue to improve their trial 
work.
