  [Text] In Beijing on 11 May, Chinese Premier Li Peng said 
that as a developing nation, conditions for China's return to 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] have now 
ripened and there is no more reason to continue excluding it 
from the trade organization. Meeting with renowned foreign 
participants to an international high-level economic forum, Li 
Peng said: China needs to resume its contracting status in GATT 
and has made efforts in this respect. In the meantime, GATT and 
the future World Trade Organization also need China. If a 
worldwide trade organization is to exclude China -- a country 
with a 1.2 billion population and rapidly developing economy -- 
it will be hard to say that such an organization is a whole one. 
Welcoming foreign guests to the economic forum, Li Peng said: 
A meeting of this nature is necessary in strengthening 
understanding, exchange, and cooperation between China and 
foreign countries; it is hoped that such a forum will be held 
regularly in the future. 
  Attending the economic forum, which opened on the same day, 
were Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, former German Chancellor 
Schmidt, and other renowned foreign political and economic 
figures.

  [Text] Sanaa, May 14 (XINHUA) -- A total of 356 Chinese 
medical personnel and overseas contract workers working in the 
strife-torn Yemen left the port city of Hodeida in the north 
tonight for Djibouti on their way home. 
  Thirty-four of the 356 Chinese had been stranded in the 
south 
since the civil war erupted in the Arab nation on May 4, and 
they later managed to evacuate from Abyan Province to arrive in 
Hodeida this afternoon with help from the Yemeni authorities. 
  However, Zhang Chengjian, deputy director of a Chinese 
medical team working in Abyan, was shot dead on May 9 during the 
evacuation. 
  Most of the Chinese nationals working in the south had left 
Aden, capital of the south, on May 7. 149 other Chinese working 
in the north left Sanaa for home by air two days ago. 
  So far most of the Chinese working in yemen have evacuated 
from the country. 
  The civil war has been raging since May 4 between the north 
and south which joined in an uneasy union in 1990.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren said here today that China attaches importance to its 
friendly relations and cooperation with the Council for the Arab 
States of the Gulf and its member nations. 
  During a meeting with the council's secretary-general Shaykh 
Fahim Bin-Sultan al-Qasimi and his party here this morning, Rong 
said that since reform and opening was initiated over a decade 
ago, China's economy has developed fastly and vigorously. 
  He said that China has a vast market potential and good 
conditions for investment, so economic and trade cooperation 
between China and the council have broad prospects. 
  Rong noted that China welcomes business people from the Gulf 
countries, hoping that they come either for visits or for 
on-the- spot investigations. 
  Rong said that China is willing to further cooperate with 
the 
council and its member nations on the basis of mutual benefit 
and respect so as to learn from each other and progress together. 
  Al-Qasimi said that he and his delegation are satisfied with 
the results of their visit, adding that they, as developing 
countries, also feel proud of China's economic development. 
  He said that they believe bilateral cooperation has a broad 
prospect.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup" by Xie Dongfeng: "Israel, PLO Are Turning </F>
Words Into Deeds"] 
  [Text] Jerusalem, May 13 (XINHUA) -- It is the ninth day 
after the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Israel and the 
Palestinians are turning words into deeds smoothly on the whole, 
though there have been some delays in the entry of Palestinian 
policemen into the autonomous areas. 
  In Jericho, Israeli and Palestinian officials will hold a 
brief ceremony this morning during which the authority of the 
city will be transferred to Palestinians, who will then take 
control of the civil administration building. 
  The last Israeli troops will leave the area this afternoon, 
ending almost 27 years of Israeli rule. 
  On Thursday [12 May], an advance team of 20 Palestinian 
officers crossed the Allenby Bridge and toured the Jericho area. 
  Later today, they will be joined by another 40 police 
officers who will take control of the sites to be taken over by 
Palestinians. 
  The two major military installations to be taken over are 
the 
Israeli Army base in the south and the Israeli police office in 
the city center. Only a handful of Israeli troops still remain 
there and everything is ready for a hand-over. 
  The Palestinian police will be also stationed at the site of 
the ancient synagogue, although under an agreement, Israelis are 
guaranteed access to the synagogue. 
  If the hand-over goes on smoothly, the area will be taken 
control by 426 Palestinian policemen from the Palestine 
Liberation Army from the Iraq-based Aqsa brigade who will arrive 
later this afternoon through the Allenby Bridge from Jordan. 
  Palestinian Police Chief Mudar Yusuf said Thursday in 
Jericho 
that the first priority will be to ensure law and order and the 
plans are for a self-rule area open to all. 
  So far, Jericho is still a closed military zone. An Israeli 
Army commander, Ilan Biran, said he issued such an order for 
fear of terrorist attacks both by extremist Palestinians and 
Jewish settlers. 
  In Gaza, though the first entry of Palestinian policemen was 
much delayed until the early hours of Wednesday, the Israeli 
troops completed the withdrawal from Southern Gaza Thursday 
night. 
  The soldiers evacuated all the outposts in Rafah although 
Palestinians have yet to take control of them. Earlier this 
morning, three positions in Khan Yunis were handed over to the 
Palestinian policemen. 
  It is reported that the Gaza City, Jabalya Refugee Camp and 
the rest of the northern strip of Gaza are expected to be handed 
over to Palestinians by next Wednesday. 
  In the coming days, contingents of PLA and Palestinian 
policemen will arrive in Gaza and Jericho from Arab states. 
  Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) 
published a list of 15 members of the 24-member governing 
council for the Gaza-Jericho areas. Israel had demanded a full 
list before handing over the reigns of authority. 
  Under the Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo last week, the 
transfer of power from Israelis to Palestinians will be 
concluded within three weeks, that is, by May 25. 
  Israeli Deputy Chief of General Staff Amnon Shahaq said 
Wednesday that the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho 
could be fulfilled by the end of next week. 
  Now it seems that the Israeli troops are speeding up their 
pace of withdrawal to keep its promise that it had no intention 
to drag on in the future autonomous areas. 
  While the Palestinians are celebrating and preparing for 
their long-awaited autonomy, the Israeli Cabinet and Parliament 
have given green light to the Gaza-Jericho agreement to ensure 
support for the implementation of the accord. The opposition 
forces are strong, but nobody can turn the page upside down. 
  Accompanying the implementation of the accord is a peaceful 
scene the two areas have never seen in these years. 
  Both Israeli soldiers and Palestinians have shown their 
restraint, except for the clashes between Israeli soldiers and 
the anxious and impatient Palestinians awaiting the arrival of 
their own police Sunday. 
  On the other hand, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) 
has stopped its terrorist actions recently, after it reached an 
agreement with the Fatah that it would suspend attacks on 
Palestinian collaborators for a month once the autonomy accord 
was signed. 
  However, there were still violent elements emerging these 
days. 
  Israeli security forces Thursday detained two Palestinians 
suspected of firing at an army post in Jabalya. Israeli border 
policemen arrested four men near Rafah Thursday, who were 
suspected of shooting and wounding an Israeli truck driver in 
Gush Katif in the afternoon. 
  On Tuesday, three Israelis were wounded by gunshots fired at 
egged bus No. 474 in Beitel of the West Bank, but it is still 
not clear who the attackers were.

and 
the two armed forces will continue to be consolidated.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "Roundup": "Sihanouk Pessimistic About Peace </F>
in Cambodia"] 
  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 14 (XINHUA) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
is very pessimistic about the prospects for peace and 
reconciliation in Cambodia following cool responses to his 
latest peace plan from both the government and the Khmer Rouge. 
  He said Thursday [12 May] that he was abandoning his peace 
efforts and leaving for medical treatment in a Beijing hospital 
on May 18, two weeks earlier than scheduled. 
  As the civil war escalates in west and northwest Cambodia, 
Sihanouk called for a round-table meeting between the royal 
government and the democratic Kampuchea on April 22. 
  However, the meeting was not held because of wide 
differences 
between Phnom Penh and the Khmer Rouge. 
  The Khmer Rouge thought its delegation might be in danger if 
the meeting were to be held in Phnom Penh and suggested a 
neutral site instead. 
  But the government claimed that it could guarantee the Khmer 
Rouge delegation safety 100 percent, and insisted that the 
meeting be held in Cambodia. 
  Sihanouk, who attempted to negotiate an end to the Cambodian 
war, on May 2 called for a total, immediate, unconditional and 
standstill cease-fire in Cambodia, and suggested holding the 
round-table meeting in the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea, but his efforts failed again. 
  Last weekend he suggested a new election, an idea which was 
immediately supported by the Khmer Rouge. However, some local 
newspapers and officials accused the king of "seeking power". 
  Despite the king's call, military conflicts are escalating, 
spreading from Battambang to 7 provinces, including Siem Reap, 
Kratie, Kompong Speu, Kompong Cham and Kampot. 
  As government troops fought to stave off a large-scale 
offensive by Khmer Rouge guerrillas, a government military 
spokesman said that 30 guerrillas had been killed and 30 injured. 
  The spokesman said that government forces had pushed the 
Khmer Rouge further back along National Route No. 10 on Sunday 
in Battambang, and had recaptured villages in Siem Reap and 
Kompong Speu. 
  But according to Khmer Rouge radio monitored here today, the 
Khmer Rouge, who are even threatening to take the city of 
Battambang, have captured three villages in Sangker District, 
east of Battambang and taken over a government stronghold 11 
kilometers north of Battambang. 
  The radio said they have also captured 23 villages along 
National Route No. 6 in Siem Reap Province, taken over four 
counties in Kratie Province, and cut the communications over the 
Mekong River this week. 
  Discouraged by his fruitless peace efforts, Sihanouk said 
angrily "even with 100 round-tables, there will be no peace." 
  He said he did not understand "why Khmers want to destroy 
their own country, want to destroy their own people." 
  King Sihanouk is now bringing his peace plan to Beijing and 
Pyongyang. Observers here believe that an end to the civil war 
is nowhere in sight.

and Liu Yaqun (0491 0068 5028): "The Second Session of the 
Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress Concludes 
Successfully"] 
  [Text] On 12 April, bright sunshine filled the provincial 
capital with beautiful spring scenery after the rain. Having 
completed its various points on the agenda as scheduled, the 
seven-day second session of the eighth Anhui provincial people's 
congress concluded successfully at 1700 amid the solemn national 
anthem. 
  Held at the Anhui Theater, the closing ceremony for the

Other executive chairmen included Lu Rongjing, Meng Fulin, Yang 
Yongliang, Wang Taihua, Fang Zhaoxiang, Shao Ming, Lu Shengdao, 
Wu Changqi, Lu Zixiu, Jiang Zehui, and Chen Jiyu. 
  The deputies elected by secret ballot Cai Bingjiu [5591 4426 
0036] to fill a vice chairmanship vacancy of the eighth 
provincial people's congress Standing Committee. 
  Deputies at the session passed, by a show of hands, six 
resolutions on the government work report, the implementation of 
Anhui Province's 1993 economic and social development program

  Meng Fulin, provincial people's congress Standing Committee 
chairman, delivered a speech before the session concluded. 
  Meng Fulin said: The second session of the eighth provincial 
people's congress is a session of democracy, unity, and realism 
filled with a motivational atmosphere. This session will surely 
have a significant effect on seeking the unity of thinking; on 
further acquiring a clear understanding of and submitting to the 
overall state of the work of the entire party and country; on 
comprehensively pushing forward the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system; on promoting sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development; and on advancing the development 
of democracy, the legal system, and spiritual civilization. 
  Meng Fulin pointed out: This session has set the major tasks 
this year for the province. People across the province are now 
facing the tasks of further inspiring enthusiasm, dedicating 
themselves heart and soul to the same cause, paying serious 
attention to work implementation, striving for a sure victory, 
and maintaining and developing the current great situation. 
  Meng Fulin expressed the hope that his fellow deputies 
would, 
after returning to their respective posts, actively propagate 
and implement the guidelines of this session; set an example in 
abiding by and executing the session resolutions, earnestly 
carry out their duties as deputies, throw themselves into reform 
before others, promote development, safeguard stability; take 
the lead in joining the development of democracy, the legal 
system, and spiritual civilization; and, along with all people 
in the province, work hard to make new contributions to 
fulfilling all tasks put forward by this session.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Dongfu (7115 2639 1133); Beijing </F>
XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 1130 GMT on 12 May 
transmits a service message canceling the following item] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- The Central Committee 
of the Communist Youth League [CYL] recently held an on-the-spot 
meeting on experimental "East-West labor service cooperation" in 
Wujin County, Jiangsu Province. The meeting was held to 
popularize across the country the successful experience of the 
Wujin County CYL Committee in youth labor service cooperation. 
  As many enterprises in Wujin county were in need of 
high-quality workers while a large number of migrant workers 
from out of town could not find jobs and caused social problems, 
the Wujin County CYL Committee actively introduced workers to 
enterprises from as early as July 1992. Over the last two 
years, the county CYL committee has introduced more than 3,000 
qualified young people to some 200 enterprises in the county, 
with the quality of new workers guaranteed by "four documents" 
(CYL membership card, ID card, diploma, and proof of good 
physical condition). The retention rate of the new work force 
exceeds 90 percent, showing satisfaction among the enterprises, 
young workers, and parents. The economy-related new undertaking 
of the county CYL committee has been praised by the CYL Central 
Committee as the "rainbow project." 
  Bayinqolu, secretary of the CYL Central Committee, said at 
the on-the-spot meeting: The essence of the "rainbow project" 
is to introduce labor service in an organized way and enable 
developed regions to employ the surplus labor force of less 
developed regions. During the process, we should strive to 
achieve a virtuous circle of "young people seeking employment 
outside their home towns, becoming specialized personnel, 
returning home, and becoming successful entrepreneurs in their 
home towns." The "rainbow project" is of great significance to 
our country's economic development. 
  At the Wujin meeting, representatives of 50 county CYL 
organizations in 19 provinces and municipalities conducted 
negotiations on labor service cooperation. Wujin county alone 
signed contracts with Sichuan, Jilin, Guizhou, and Henan 
Provinces on hiring a total of more than 4,000 workers.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China's leading 
industrial center will make fresh efforts to vigorously develop 
its rural industry this year. 
  Officials at the Administration of Industry in suburban 
Shanghai said they have worked out a plan to foster the leading 
enterprises among rural industrial businesses. 
  A rural enterprise must meet at least one of the following 
three requirements if it wants to be called a "dragon head 
enterprise": output value surpassing 500 million yuan and 
profits amounting to 20 million yuan; delivery of commodities 
for export totalling 10 million U.S. dollars a year; or 
experiencing a net increase of 100 million yuan in the output 
value of products for 1994. 
  The municipality now has 15,000 rural and township 
industrial 
enterprises. Last year these enterprises generated 78.8 billion 
yuan in output value, accounting for a quarter of Shanghai's 
total industrial output value. 
  Experts believe that such a program will bring about 
fundamental changes in the development of Shanghai's rural 
industry. The structure of technological products will be 
gradually adapted to the operation of the city's new economy, 
and a modern enterprise system is being introduced into rural 
industrial enterprises by way of takeover, share participation 
and joint operation.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Thanks to the changes 
in the people's conception of marriage and birth, China's most 
populous city of Shanghai expects to see a negative population 
growth for the second year running this year. 
  The Shanghai Municipal Family Planning Committee estimated 
the number of new-born babies is less than 81,000 this year as 
against 84,000 last year, the lowest birth rate on record in the 
city's history. 
  According to the latest report provided by the Shanghai 
Municipal Statistical Bureau, the municipal population (the 
number of people with permanent residence permits) stands at 
13.49 million, the population growth rate is 6.5 per thousand 
and the death rate is 7.3 per thousand. 
  A recent survey shows that the government's family planning 
policy has struck roots in the minds of young couples and young 
people prefer to marry late. The marrying age for men averages 
28.8 years old and that for women is 26.8, both three years 
older than a decade ago, although the marriage eligibility age 
for men is 22 years old while that for women is 20 as the 
revised marriage law provides. 
  The survey shows that at least half of the newly weds have 
planned to have a child late, because some wanted to sharpen 
their skills and develop themselves to secure a place in the 
market economy; some plan to enjoy themselves and others are 
waiting for their best child-bearing years. 
  "My home is far from the work place and I feel tired after a 
day's work," said a dentist whose family name is Yu. 
  The 36-year-old Yu married four years ago and still does not 
want to become a father. "I cannot spare the time for raising a 
child," he said. 
  The sea of people everywhere, in streets, buses, shops and 
parks has compelled more and more couples to adopt a prudent 
attitude towards birth. 
  At present, 85 percent of the couples in Shanghai are in 
favor of the "one-child family" policy, and one-third of them 
said they do not care whether their offspring is a son or a girl. 
  Shanghai has 1.95 million couples who have vowed never to 
have another child after the first, accounting for 4.87 percent 
of some 40 million couples on the Chinese mainland. 
  "To avoid bearing a child," an official of the Shanghai 
Municipal Family Planning Committee said, "92 percent of the 
city's 5.49 million couples have employed contraceptives." 
  The contraceptive rate on the Chinese mainland is 72 percent 
and most of the one-child families are in large and medium-sized 
cities. 
  The official noted that China's family planning is not only 
aimed at reducing the population, but also at helping couples to 
have a child. 
  At present, several thousand couples have their babies with 
the help of the Shanghai Family Planning Research Institution 
and a number of hospitals, which have opened special services to 
treat infertility. 
  Experts here agreed that some are still influenced by their 
parents and want to marry early and give birth early. 
  Guo Youning, associate research fellow of the institution, 
said that, influenced by their parents, about 27 percent of 
newly-married couples change their plans and want to have 
children early. 
  "Much remains to be done to persuade all young couples to 
accept the ideal of late marriage and late birth," he added.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Beijing political situation" column by </F>
Jen Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "The High-Level CPC Leadership 
Stresses the Need To Stabilize the Situation Again"] 
  [Text] In my 22 April column, I pointed out that, in order 
to maintain the "sustained, rapid, and healthy" development of 
the national economy, the CPC has once again stressed the need 
to correctly handle the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability this year. In early April it also 
stressed the importance of giving top priority to putting 
"stability before everything else" for several years. This 
indicates that the authorities are more concerned about 
stability than reform and development. This feeling has been 
proved by the authorities' recent circular, which again stresses 
the importance of stability. 
  An informed source in Beijing revealed that the CPC had 
recently issued a circular to provincial-level party and 
government leaders on strengthening party leadership, 
implementing reform measures, and consolidating stability. 
  The circular asks localities to resolutely implement all 
reform measures that have been ratified by the central 
authorities and to promptly exchange information with the 
central authorities and warns them not proceed with work in 
their own way. 
<H5>  The CPC Issues a Circular on Stability </H5>
  The circular demands that the newly introduced reform 
measures not be permitted to affect the four major issues of the 
people, specifically, their food, clothing, housing, and 
transportation. All reform measures which could cause a decline 
in the people's standard of living or affect social stability 
should be postponed or suspended. 
  The circular demands that provincial-level party and 
government leaders should go to the enterprises, factories, 
mines, rural areas, schools, and other grass-roots units to 
propagate policies and familiarize themselves with the 
situation. In this way they will do their work in a 
down-to-earth manner. 
  The circular urges leading cadres to practice cleanliness 
and 
self-discipline and guard against corruption. For this reason, 
they should consciously accept mass supervision. 
  Some people in political circles in Beijing pointed out 
that, 
in April, the authorities stressed the importance of putting 
stability before everything else. They subsequently issued this 
circular on stabilizing the situation. More or less this 
indicates their concerns about the localities' insubordination 
and their ignorance of the importance of putting stability above 
everything else. In late April, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, as 
acting premier, held a telephone conference for provincial-level 
leaders. He said, "If the new reform measures which damage the 
masses' interests and social stability are not promptly 
corrected, the principal leaders in the localities will be held 
responsible for the consequences; they will be transferred or 
receive disciplinary action on the merits of each case." Thus 
it can be seen that the authorities are worried about social 
stability and the stability of the political situation. 
<H5>  The Meaning of Deng Xiaoping's Theory on "Stability" </H5>
  The informed source said that the CPC's concept of 
"stability" stems from Deng Xiaoping's theory on "stability." 
  In the last few years, particularly since the 4 June 
incident 
in 1989, Deng Xiaoping has paid special attention to the 
stability of Chinese society and its political situation. He 
cherishes the hope that China "will create the image of 
stability and unity for the country and the world." First, this 
has been drawn from historical experience. He has said, 
"Foreigners must be made to see that China is stable; if China 
is in a mess and divided, what hope will it have? Imperialists 
bullied us in the past, and wasn't this because we were not 
united?" Second, this has been drawn from practical lessons. 
He said that today some countries are suffering endless turmoil 
and war; this fact has provided China with negative lessons 
indicating that progress is impossible amid turmoil and that 
only stability can bring about development. Now "China is in a 
period which particularly necessitates the concentration of 
efforts on economic development." "To bring about the four 
modernizations and get rid of poverty and backwardness, China 
needs a political situation of stability and unity and must 
proceed with its construction in an organized and orderly 
manner. Disturbance makes it impossible for us to carry out our 
construction with peace of mind." "If there are demonstrations 
today and tomorrow, we cannot concentrate on construction. If 
disturbances, instability, and disorder occur, foreign capital 
will stop coming to China. We are exercising strict control in 
this respect, this will not affect foreign investment; on the 
contrary, foreign investors will feel at ease." 
  The stability and unity stressed by Deng Xiaoping covers two 
aspects. Stability is stressed from the angle of the entire 
society and sometimes is called tranquility. In this respect, 
Deng Xiaoping thinks it necessary to issue the signal that 
"China cannot afford confusion" and the slogan that "stability 
must be put before everything else"; "everything which runs 
counter to or obstructs our socialist road must be removed, and 
all factors which may lead to confusion or turmoil in China must 
be removed." Unity refers to the unity at the policymaking and 
leadership strata or the core of the central leadership. It is 
Deng Xiaoping's opinion that the "most important thing is to 
have a united leadership core." "As long as there are no 
problems with this link, China will remain as stable as Tai 
Shan. No country in the world will belittle us and more and 
more investors will come to China." "As long as the leading 
group is united and persists in an open policy, decades of 
stable development will bring about fundamental changes in 
China." 
  In accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory on creating a 
stable situation to concentrate on economic development, this 
year--the first year for implementing the "50 provisions" 
decided by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee on establishing the socialist market economic 
structure--the CPC has stressed again the importance of putting 
stability before everything else. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji's Painstaking Efforts To Hold On-Site Meetings </H5>
for Handling Official Business 
  This informed source went on to say that, although the 
high-level CPC leadership has stressed time and again the 
importance of stability, they also understand that stability can 
be basically maintained only when the economy develops. 
  For the purpose of economic development, the authorities 
recently made a special effort to urge leading cadres to go to 
the forefront to resolve problems. It is out of the same 
consideration that the circular asks leading cadres to go to the 
grass roots. In this respect, Zhu Rongji has set a good example 
for others to follow. 
  After the conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress in late March, Zhu Rongji led 10 
people in charge of the relevant ministries and commissions 
under the State Council in going to Heilongjiang Province for 
on-site meetings to resolve difficulties in economic disposition 
and problems in large and medium state enterprises (including 
military industrial enterprises). After learning about some 
staff members' and workers' complaints and disturbances which 
resulted because some enterprises had suspended or stopped their 
production, Zhu Rongji, authorized by General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin and Premier Li Peng, solemnly announced on 17 April the 
dismissal of Sun Weiben as Heilongjiang Provincial Party 
Committee secretary and the transfer of Liaoning Provincial 
Governor Qiu Qifeng as his replacement. This shows Zhu Rongji's 
resoluteness in handling key issues. 
  After holding on-site meetings to resolve problems in 
Heilongjiang Province, Zhu Rongji, at the above-mentioned 
telephone conference in late April, once again stressed the 
importance of leading cadres going to the grass roots. He said, 
"Sitting in an office reading documents and drinking tea will 
not help solve any problem. On the contrary, this might result 
in unrealistic measures or the proposition of tasks which 
currently cannot be performed at all and might even ruin the 
effort to deepen reform or affect the people's lives." 
  If Zhu Rongji's practice of on-site meetings can be 
popularized, we believe this will be useful to economic 
development and social stability. But how many communists would 
be willing to do such a "foolish thing" today?!

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Thirty families from 
different parts of the country were chosen as the country's 
"model families" here today. 
  It was the third such selection and was significant as this 
year is the "International Year of the Family". 
  The selection is aimed at promoting the development of 
family 
culture and guiding people to pursue a civilized, healthy and 
scientific lifestyle, said Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and 
president of the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) at an award 
ceremony held for the model families here today. 
  The 30 families represent a happy family atmosphere and 
colorful family life. All the family members are actively 
taking part in China's economic construction and making 
contributions to society, said Chen. 
  Among the 30 families, ten were awarded gold and silver 
prizes and 20 awarded honorary prizes through a public ballot 
and specialists' appraisal, according to Chen. 
  The selection process was jointly organized by the ACWF and 
China central television, and financially supported by an 
enterprise in Sichuan Province.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "MFN Trading Status and Sino-U.S. Ties"] </F>
  [Text] Reports say that U.S. State Department is studying 
and drafting various options on extending China's most favored 
nation [MFN] trading status, to be presented to Clinton for him 
to choose. The United States does not have much time or options 
to resolve this question. The best way is to extend China's MFN 
status unconditionally. This will benefit the two powers as 
well as the stability and prosperity of the world at large. 
  When meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger 
the day before yesterday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said 
that Sino- U.S. relations are not just limited to the two sides, 
they are closely linked to the international situation. China 
and the United States should maintain good relations for the 
sake of world peace and stability. As two big powers which can 
influence the world, China and the United States shoulder great 
responsibility for the future of the world and the destiny of 
mankind. We should do something for people of the world. Jiang 
Zemin looked at Sino-U.S. relations from the macroscopic 
viewpoint of the developing situation of the world as a whole. 
This should give U.S. policymakers much food for thought. 
  Following the end of the Cold War, some people in Western 
political circles thought that the Soviet Union had 
disintegrated and that it was no longer necessary to attach 
importance to ties with China. They even thought that the 1989 
Beijing disturbance could be used to force China to take the 
same road of the Soviet Union. Facts have totally shattered 
these people's dreams. China was not and will never be a card 
to be played by any country. China has its own weight. As a 
big country with the largest population and quickest economic 
growth in the world, China's stability and development will 
nurture the development of the Asia-Pacific region and also 
maintain peace in the region. Peace and stability are 
inseparable major issues which the world is now facing. China 
has made tremendous efforts and contributions to the solution of 
these two issues. The IMF, World Bank, and UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization and Population Organization, as well as 
industrial and commercial tycoons from the developed nations and 
the transnational corporations, have all affirmed China's 
achievements and are optimistic about China. 
  The United States is the largest developed nation and the 
only superpower in the world. Nixon's visit to China 23 years 
ago opened up a new chapter in Sino-U.S. relations. Thanks to 
the reform and opening up introduced by China, Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade ties have developed rapidly and the two 
countries have become important trading partners. Economic and 
trade ties have become increasingly important in bilateral 
relations. This conforms with the trend of contemporary 
international relations whereby economic interests constitute 
the main factor. The increasingly close economic and trade ties 
between the most populous country and the most developed nation 
in the world will naturally be conducive to world peace and 
stability. The ideal option should be cooperation and 
construction rather than confrontation and war. A relatively 
open market is one of the characteristics of the U.S. economy, 
which has benefited the United States tremendously. The flow of 
cheap and good products from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to the 
U.S. market is welcomed by U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, large 
numbers of U.S. industrial and agricultural products have also 
entered China along with the country's modernization program. 
Many large U.S. companies have discovered that China is the 
irreplaceable and last big market which can offer them enormous 
opportunities. 
  Under such circumstances, if the Clinton administration 
insist on taking the question of human rights, which has nothing 
to do with economy and trade, or even the question of Tibet, as 
bargaining chips and link these issues with the MFN status, this 
will never be accepted by the Chinese Government and people. It 
is true that China's economy will be affected without MFN status 
but the United States will also suffer great losses. More 
importantly, it will produce an impact on the situation in the 
Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. If the United 
States chooses the option of confrontation with China, its 
interests affected will not be limited to the field of economy 
and trade. The United States tried to hinder and block New 
China for a long time during the Cold War and this did not 
benefit it in the slightest. It was President Nixon who changed 
U.S. policy toward China and this is a lesson to remember. 
  The number of people from various U.S. circles supporting 
unconditional extension of China's MFN status is increasing, far 
exceeding those who are against. Since taking office, Clinton 
has not made any achievements in domestic affairs or diplomacy. 
If China's MFN status is revoked, the grave consequences will 
not help him running for another term of the presidency, still 
less the U.S. manufacturers and consumers. The United States 
should unconditionally extend China's MFN status. We believe 
that the United States, in consideration of the long-term 
interests and proceeding from the overall situation, will make a 
rational choice.

  [Text] Mayor Huang Ju met with Dr. Kissinger, former U.S. 
Secretary of State and an old friend of the Chinese people, in 
the evening of 14 May. The two had a warm and friendly 
conversation. Huang Ju warmly welcomed Kissinger's return to 
Shanghai and hoped he would maintain his friendship and 
cooperation with China, particularly his cooperation with 
Shanghai. 
  Kissinger praised Shanghai as an exciting city. He said: 
Shanghai's economic progress over the last two or three years is 
much greater than its progress in the preceding decade and more. 
Deng Xiaoping discussed some reform measures two years ago, and 
his views have been affirmed [de dao liao zheng shi] by the 
changes in last two years. 
  Kissinger arrived in Shanghai on 14 May afternoon. During 
his stay in Shanghai, he and his party will tour the New Pudong 
District.

<F P=106> [Correspondents identified by caption; from the "National </F>

  [Text] Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger, who is 
currently on a visit to Beijing, was interviewed by station 
reporters on the afternoon of 13 May. [video shows a 
correspondent with a microphone in hand sitting across from 
Kissinger; a caption on the bottom of the screen reads: An 
interview with Kissinger by correspondents Gu Yunlong (6253 0061 
7893), Wu Wei (0702 3555), and Xie Li (6200 0500]) 
  [Correspondent] Dr. Kissinger, as a farseeing politician, 
what are your views on China's status and role in the world 
political and economic orders now and in the future? How should 
China proceed to take advantage of the opportunity presented to 
China by the world? 
  [Kissinger, in English fading into Chinese translation] 
First, the new world order will be composed of some influential 
countries: the United States, Japan, China, Russia, Europe, and 
India. These nations interact with one another free of any 
ideological conflicts and share common interests in many areas. 
  China attaches great importance to stability in Asia, does 
not have any territorial designs, and does not have troops 
stationed outside its borders. The United States has no 
territorial designs, either. This can serve as a basis for 
common efforts toward maintaining global peace. 
  China will play an increasingly important role on the world 
stage. Economically, China will grow in importance as an 
exporter; at the same time, it will also become a major 
importer, thus becoming an integral part of the world economy. 
Because the world economy is closely linked with countries of 
the world, China's development will have a direct impact on 
world economic development. China follows with great interest 
countries of the world, which, on the other hand, have shown 
great interest in China. In the next century, China will play 
an even bigger role.

  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong 
Yiren met with Dr. Kissinger, former U.S. secretary of state, 
today. They discussed bilateral relations between China and the 
United States and some international issues. 
  Rong first expressed his appreciation over the important 
role 
played by former U.S. President Nixon, who passed away recently, 
in opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations and in pushing the 
normalization of formal relations between the two countries. 
Rong Yiren said: Dr. Kissinger, as an assistant to Nixon then, 
has also made great contributions in this aspect. 
  Rong Yiren said that China hopes to see a peaceful and 
stable 
international environment and that differences between China and 
the the United States should be solved through discussions and 
consultations on an equal footing. 
  Kissinger said he hoped that U.S.-China relations would be 
improved and developed in a constructive way, and the trade 
between the two countries should also be separated from human 
rights and all other issues. He believed that the two countries 
can cooperate in a friendly manner and in a still wider sphere. 
  The meeting proceeded in an extremely warm and friendly 
atmosphere.

  [Text] Seoul, May 14 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed 
regret today over the decision by the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to change fuel rods at its 5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor. 
  "It's extremely regrettable that North Korea (DPRK) gave 
notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods 
at its nuclear reactor," said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho. 
  The DPRK has notified the United States and the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) respectively that it could no longer 
defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its reactor for 
technical reasons. 
  But in its letter to the IAEA, Pyongyang said it has "just 
begun" the process and the agency still has time to choose the 
rods and place them under inspection for future measurement. 
  Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have claimed that changing 
the 
rods without IAEA supervision would end the dialogue and place 
the DPRK nuclear issue in the United Nations Security Council. 
  "The South Korean Government emphasizes to North Korea the 
importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the 
IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken 
to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of 
the fuel rods," Chang said. 
  He expressed support for the IAEA dispatching an inspection 
team to the DPRK and urged Pyongyang to negotiate with the 
agency on the replacement of the rods at the nuclear reactor and 
to carry out its "full obligations." 
  Postponement of the refueling is a condition for the IAEA 
inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. The agency told 
Pyongyang earlier this week it would send an inspection team "on 
the assumption" that the DPRK was deferring the changing of the 
rods. 
  Officials here said that the uncertainty over the nuclear 
reactor is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the inspection 
team. 
  They said that it remains unclear whether the IAEA will go 
ahead and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an 
official reply from the DPRK before deciding.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- A visiting delegation of 
the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Japan's No. 2 opposition 
force, delivered a conciliatory message Monday [16 May] from 
Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata addressed to Chinese Communist Party 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin, delegation members said. 
  The message, which touched on controversial remarks made 
early this month by then Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, was 
delivered by SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo, leader of the 
group that arrived in Beijing on Sunday. 
  In the message, which was received by Li Shuzheng, head of 
the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department, 
Hata called for development of Sino-Japanese relations and 
reiterated his regret over Nagano's remarks. 
  The message followed a letter from Hata last week to Chinese 
Premier Li Peng, in which the prime minister tried to ameliorate 
the hurt caused by Nagano's denial of Japan's aggression during 
World War II and assertion that the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a 
fabrication. Nagano has since resigned. 
  On Sunday, the SDP delegation met with Politburo Member Ding 
Guangen, chief of the Communist Party's Propaganda Department 
and a member of the secretariat of the Central Committee. 
  They conveyed to him Hata's assurances that Japan will 
remain 
mindful of its past aggression and colonial rule in Asia. 
  In Monday's talks with Li, Kubo urged that China assume a 
more active role in facilitating a resolution on the issue of 
North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development. 
  Li, however, was quoted as saying China's leverage is 
limited 
and that a resolution of the issue should be achieved through 
dialogue between the parties directly concerned. 
  Kubo proposed that Japan and China participate in a 
six-nation forum on security issues in Northeast Asia, which 
would also include North and South Korea, the United States and 
Russia. 
  But Li was said to have expressed some reservation about 
U.S. 
participation in any future talks. 
  The SDP delegation, which will meet on Tuesday with Jiang, 
is 
on an eight-day visit at the invitation of the Chinese Communist 
Party to mark the 10th anniversary of exchanges between the two 
parties. 
  The mission will return home on May 22.

<F P=106> [By reporters Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755) and Ji Bin (1213 </F>
2430)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier of the 
State Council Li Peng said today that using straw to develop 
cattle industry in agricultural zones is an undertaking that 
benefits both the state and the people because it enriches the 
masses' "shopping baskets," helps increase farmers' incomes, 
brings about the development of relevant processing industry, 
and promotes a virtuous cycle in ecology in farm areas. 
  Leading comrades of the State Council, including Li Peng, Li 
Lanqing, Chen Junsheng, and Luo Gan, met today at Zhongnanhai 
with representatives from the Third National Forum on Developing 
Animal Husbandry in Farm Zones. 
  Li Peng said: In developing agriculture, it is not only 
necessary to do a good job in grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crop production, but also to develop diverse operations to 
increase farmers' incomes. Cattle-raising is a good way to 
increase farmers' incomes. He added: Using straw as animal feed 
may promote development of the cattle industry and development 
of relevant processing industries. The cattle industry can be 
said to be a type of ecological farming. Using straw to feed 
cattle and turning cow dung into fertilizer will benefit the 
virtuous cycle of farming. In developing the cattle industry, 
he suggested combining the methods of collective, large-scale 
cattle breeding with individual cattle raising, bringing 
superior labor resources into play, placing more emphasis on 
scientific cattle-raising techniques, and modernizing the cattle 
industry. He also proposed developing the leather-making 
industry as there is a great market potential for leather 
products. He urged scientific, technological, and industrial 
departments to develop relevant machinery equipment so as to 
raise the industrial level of the leather-making industry. Li 
Peng stressed, seeing that as China has rich straw resources, 
that there is great potential for using straw to develop the 
cattle industry. He called on localities to adopt positive 
measures to further promote the use of straw to develop the 
cattle industry. 
  State Councillor Chen Junsheng spoke at today's closing 
meeting about the great potential for developing animal 
husbandry in farm zones. He said when promoting the use of 
straw to develop the cattle industry throughout the nation, it 
is necessary to consolidate and further develop beef production 
areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Huang He [Yellow 
River]; to develop beef production areas in the northeast; to 
explore beef production in South China; to devote about eight 
years to launching a major drive to accelerate the development 
pace of the cattle industry; and to help raise China's total 
beef output to new heights. [passage omitted on cattle raising 
in Shandong, Henan, and other areas] 
  A decision was also adopted at the current meeting to 
promote 
the use of straw for raising sheep. The nation's farm zones 
will experiment with using straw to raise sheep starting next 
year. [passage omitted on giving titles to advanced 
cattle-raising collectives and individuals]

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Guangru (2621 0342 5423)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- After spending two days 
in discussion meetings with directors of some areas' textile 
industry departments and bureaus, and with representatives of 
the textile industry, State Council Vice Premier Li Lanqing 
stressed, at a forum of the textile industry held on 6 April, 
that if we want to solve the problems existing in the textile 
industry, we must rely partly on the efforts of the industry 
itself to enhance vigor, practice plain living, and work hard; 
and partly on understanding and support from all quarters. He 
urged all departments in all areas to take appropriate measures 
to expedite the textile industry's embarking on a road of 
healthy development as soon as possible. 
  The textile industry had made tremendous contributions to 
the 
motherland and her people. In his speech, Li Lanqing fully 
affirmed these contributions. He said: The textile industry is 
the mainstay of China's industries now and will remain so in the 
future. This is because it not only meets the Chinese people's 
increasing need for clothes but it also holds first place among 
all of China's industries in generating foreign exchange from 
exports. It is also impossible that the industry's superior 
export performance will disappear in the future. Therefore, 
China's textile industry has bright prospects. 
  The textile industry, however, faces unprecedented 
challenges 
and tests in the course of shifting our track from a planned 
economy to a market economy. Li Lanqing said: The following 
new problems have cropped up in the textile industry since early 
this year. Cotton is in short supply; cotton prices have gotten 
out of control; only about 42 percent of the tasks for the 
allocation and transfer of cotton have been fulfilled; there has 
been too sharp an increase in the prices of cotton yarn and 
cotton cloth; an increasing number of enterprises have been 
forced to stop production; the contradiction of a drop in the 
industry's economic efficiency is very conspicuous; and the 
state of the industry's exports is grim. 
  The supply of and demand for cotton has a direct bearing 
on the normal production order of the textile industry. Because 
of this, Li Lanqing pointed out: State-owned enterprises must 
take control of cotton purchased by the state. It should be 
allocated according to the state plan and the prices for 
different grades of cotton. First of all, reselling at high 
prices by state-owned enterprises to seek exorbitant profits 
should be strictly prohibited. The State Planning Commission 
and departments in charge of prices should work with the 
relevant departments to draw up a list of prices for different 
grades of cotton and have it published in newspapers. The 
industrial and commercial administrative departments and other 
law-enforcement departments should strengthen the management of 
the markets for cotton and crack down on lawbreakers or 
speculators trying to resell cotton for exorbitant profits. 
  To maintain the normal order in purchasing cotton, Li 
Lanqing 
stressed: Because cotton and hemp companies have been entrusted 
by the state to purchase cotton and allocate it to various 
departments, it must be allocated according to the plan. 
Governments at all levels should be responsible for checking on 
compliance; they should check whether provinces, cities, and 
districts have fulfilled their allocation tasks. Provincial 
authorities should also check compliance in the counties. 
Counties which have not fulfilled their allocation tasks should 
be made accountable for the missing cotton. Units or individuals 
who seek profits by reselling state-distributed cotton, or who 
divert it for private use must be severely punished. 
  Li Lanqing said: At present, it is necessary to see to it 
that key export enterprises are supplied with cotton. At the 
same time, it is necessary to prevent low-quality, 
low-technology, and low-efficiency small cotton-weaving 
enterprises from using state-allocated cotton, and also to 
prevent speculation by cotton dealers. An effective measure to 
ensure this is to extend loans to support key enterprises while 
suspending loans to low-quality small cotton- weaving plants and 
to cotton speculators. It is necessary to get to the root of 
the problem by giving play to the macroeconomic regulatory role 
of the money policy. Banks should quickly make arrangements to 
implement the money policy. 
  Turning to the reform of the system for the circulation of 
cotton, Li Lanqing said: Cotton is a special commodity having a 
bearing on the national economy and people's lives. In the 
future, neither should we follow the past method of unified 
state purchasing and marketing, nor should we adopt a 
laissez-faire attitude toward this matter. We should explore a 
new path. We can try setting up state-owned spot wholesale 
markets combining internal and foreign trade and combining 
purchasing, stockpiling, and marketing. Such markets will 
become the main channels for cotton purchasing, marketing, and 
wholesale business, which will play the role of controlling 
markets, reducing intermediate links, and ensuring supplies. In 
the area of prices, we should introduce a reasonable 
price-protection system in accordance with the principle of 
relative interests so as to encourage cotton growers to grow 
cotton and thus to ensure a balance between supply and demand. 
  On how to help the textile industry extricate itself from 
its difficult position, Li Lanqing expressed the following 
views: The first step is to "give emergency treatment and 
stabilize the illness," the second step is to "treat the 
illness," and the third step is to "convalesce and get better 
and better." He said: The three steps are not completely 
separated from one another, and they are designed to "deal with 
both the root cause and the symptoms." 
  Analyzing the existing deep-seated problems of the textile 
industry, Li Lanqing explained: During the shift from the 
planned economy to the socialist market economy, the problems of 
the old system will be clearly demonstrated because we can no 
longer rely on a state-controlled low-price supply of raw 
materials from the place of origin, because production tasks are 
no longer assigned by higher-level departments, and because the 
marketing of products is no longer guaranteed by the commercial 
department. The existing difficulties and problems of the 
textile industry are part of those problems. The textile 
industry is ill in terms of its "structure," "operational 
mechanisms," and "technology." For this reason, while we are 
adopting measures to help the textile industry overcome 
difficulties, we should also pay great attention to the 
structural readjustment, enterprise reorganization, and 
technological transformation of the textile industry. 
  Li Lanqing said: On the one hand, the current problems mean 
difficulties. On the other hand, they also are an opportunity 
for us to readjust the structure. First, we must vigorously 
carry out a spindle-reduction transformation. In particular, we 
should pay attention to the technological transformation of post 
printing-and-dyeing processing to ensure a large quantity, good 
quality, and high efficiency in the production of yarn and 
cotton fabrics. The post printing-and-dyeing processing should 
yield more patterns and designs and high added value. During 
the course of the structural readjustment, some cotton-fabric 
plants should be gradually relocated to cotton-producing regions 
through corporations, the shareholding system, or joint 
operations. In other words, we should carry out a structural 
readjustment of industrial zones. This is also a measure to 
narrow the gap between coastal regions and interior regions. 
  After explaining the concrete concept and measures for the 
readjustment and reform of the textile industry, Li Lanqing 
discussed enterprise reorganization. He said: We should learn 
from the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation in comprehensive and coordinated reform; should 
readjust industrial structures, reorganize enterprises, improve 
their operational mechanisms, resettle surplus personnel, and 
arouse enthusiasm among enterprise workers and staff members. 
If conditions permit, we should form joint-stock 
technology-industry-trade enterprise groups, with either 
industry or foreign trade as their main business, so as to take 
advantage of the strength of joint operations to enhance market 
competitive power. 
  On the export of textile goods, Li Lanqing said: We should 
further the reform to improve the quality and increase the 
economic returns of export goods. The Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and Economic Cooperation and the China Textile Council should 
jointly formulate procedures for inviting public bids for 
textile export quotas in accordance with the principle of 
efficiency, fairness, and openness. The import-export chamber of 
commerce should play a coordinating and guiding role. He said 
that enterprises with export quotas and export permits may 
engage in the production of the "two kinds of yarn and cotton 
fabrics" [not further specified] by processing materials 
supplied by overseas clients. 
  Li Lanqing especially emphasized in his speech: We should 
step up the making of policies for the textile industry. They 
should include the consumption policy, technology policy, 
industrial organization policy, import-export policy, marketing 
policy, foreign capital utilization policy, and geographic 
distribution policy, as well as measures to guarantee the 
implementation of these policies. 
  It is reported that the State Council attaches great 
importance to the operations of the textile industry. Since it 
was briefed by the China Textile Council in December 1993, the 
State Council has issued a document based on a thorough 
investigation and study. At present, all localities are 
actively carrying out the 21 measures listed in the document. 
The State Planning Commission, in cooperation with other 
commissions and ministries, is stepping up the formulation of 
the industrial policies for the textile industry. This forum, 
which began a few days ago, was held in Beijing by the China 
Textile Council. Present at the meeting were representatives of 
some provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional textile 
management departments, directors of some enterprises, and 
responsible persons of some ministries and commissions 
concerned. They discussed the best policies for the development 
of the textile industry.

  [Text] Introduction 
  China's economic structural reform has entered its 16th 
year. 
Reform heretofore can be roughly divided into two stages. In its 
first stage, i.e., from 1978 to 1991, reform was carried out in 
rural areas first, and afterward in urban areas; in the domain 
of distribution, and then in that of production; in enterprise 
management structure, and then in ownership structure; in 
commodity price adjustment, and then in their relaxation; and in 
consumer goods markets, and then in capital markets. This was a 
progressive pattern of reform in order of priorities, which was 
a path in keeping with China's actual conditions, and in 
particular, with the structure and development background at the 
initial stage of reform. Hence, the reform attained success, 
made momentous advances, and gave impetus to the change of the 
entire economic structure from a planned economy to a socialist 
market economy. 
  Although reform at the first stage could not be referred to 
simplistically as having forged ahead in single items and 
penetrated in depth by isolated forces, yet reform indeed had 
not been carried out in a comprehensive way. As a selected 
strategy, reform was guided by the principle of decentralizing 
power and granting benefits to lower levels so that it could 
make steady advances. As the ultimate goal of transforming the 
entire structure was not clear at the beginning, however, reform 
could be carried out only one step after another, just like 
"feeling the stones in order to wade across the river," so that 
inevitably it was restricted in breadth, as well as in depth. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks during his south China tour 
in early 1992, as well as the 14th National Party Congress, 
oriented the transformation of the entire economic structure 
toward the establishment of a socialist market economic 
structure, which brought the reform theory as a policy guide to 
a new height. With the distinct orientation of reform goal, 
there came a juncture, at which we entered a new stage of 
economic reform, and conditions are ripe for reform to select a 
strategy of changing from gradual to accelerated progress, from 
a partial to an overall scale, and from tentative experiments to 
comprehensive planning. Accelerated and coordinated reform, 
however, call for even more careful consideration and 
preparations. Reform in 1993 was conducted against precisely 
this background. Judging from the high plane of reform 
strategy, 1993 was a year in which reform was pushed forward and 
the move to a new stage was effected. It also was a year in 
which theory was systemized and plans were worked out for the 
upcoming comprehensive, coordinated reform. In the meantime, 
some reform measures in conformity with market economy 
development were introduced at a new level during the year. 
  As reform at this new stage has a higher degree of 
comprehensiveness and continuity, we must not demand that 
prominent results be scored in a certain single year, but must 
base ourselves on an overall and long-term assessment. What is 
more, the problems existing in the course of economic operation 
at present stem primarily from the frictions of the double-track 
system, which was the inevitable result of the deep-rooted 
conflicts of the old structure in the transition from the 
commodity economy to the market economy. Although the 
"intensified macroeconomic regulation and control" measures 
taken in the summer and fall of 1993, and the parameter 
regulation mechanism [canshu tiaojie jizhi 0639 2422 6148 4634 
2623 0455] introduced in parallel with them could not completely 
break away from the regulative mode of the traditional planned 
economy, yet the practice of flexibly applying "fine tuning" and 
intensifying the pivotal macromanagement role of finance -- 
particularly banking -- definitely has seized hold of the basic 
elements of macroeconomic regulative mechanism to converge with 
the market economy. Certainly, in face of current problems, we 
should analyze their prominent causes and discover ways to solve 
them. To accelerate the pace of reform in the new stage, and 
particularly in 1994, we should put forward pragmatic 
countermeasures. These are the obligations and duties of all 
economists, and are the basic starting points of this research 
paper. 
<H5>  Reform Achievements Attained During the Juncture </H5>
  In 1993, the central authorities concentrated forces from 
various quarters on the design of a blueprint for comprehensive 
reform, and put forward coordinated reform plans starting from 
five areas: Finance, taxation, investment, enterprises, and 
social insurance. This was a tremendous achievement, as it 
defined the action items for reform in the new stage, after 
having summarized the economic reform experience over the past 
15 years. Without doubt, since 1984, whenever a more broad scale 
reform measure has been introduced, a program has been worked 
out, but this program has been either a rough outline or the 
sudden advance of a single item, and has not called for 
comprehensive coordination in accordance with the market 
economy. The reform program made in 1993, however, was a major 
coordinated one, based on the market, which made proper 
preparations for comprehensive structural reform in the second 
stage. 
  In the sequence of the reform process, the substance and 
intensity of reform cannot be even or with equal value, so they 
may be large one year and small another. Generally speaking, in 
a year when reform has less content, we will have our eyes on 
the rectification of economic order and the solution of new 
contradictions that have become conspicuous so as to create a 
fine environment for reform in the next step. The 1989-91 
campaign to "improve economic environment and rectify economic 
order," and the "macroeconomic regulation and control" exercised 
from July to October 1993 all belonged to this category. The 
previous retrenchment of the economy, however, while a 
comprehensive one, had an excessively large intensity and lasted 
for an excessively long time. Moreover, it depended mainly on 
administrative fiats to reduce projects, cut investments, and 
control the growth of demand with targets set at a low pace in 
order to achieve a man-made "equilibrium of demand and supply." 
As a result, the market was sluggish for two and a half years, 
which was an aftermath of the three-year economic improvement 
and rectification. In addition, when a favorable environment 
for reform emerged, we failed to seize the opportunity to 
increase the content of reform, thus missing an excellent chance 
to bring about the move from the first stage to the second at 
the earliest possible date. 
  In contrast with the former economic retrenchment, the one 
in 
1993 was not comprehensive. It lasted for only some six months, 
and its intensity was comparatively less. Moreover, traditional 
target controls were replaced by parametric controls. On the 
one hand, we regulated residents' and enterprises' action on 
money by flexibly readjusting exchange rates so as to stabilize 
them and ensure the renminbi's reputation and position. In 
particular, the exchange-rate unification efforts have provided 
experience and lessons for the monetary reform which certainly 
will be carried out in the future. On the other hand, although 
interest rates were readjusted by a narrower margin, the move 
basically halted over-expanded investment, promoted residents' 
inclination to save, curbed overly dynamic consumption, 
stabilized the market, and acted to bring about a "soft 
landing." Without doubt, this parametric control was achieved 
through the government's direct intervention, which is still a 
certain distance away from the parametric management of a 
developed market economy. The problem is that under a structure 
in which banks are not separate from the government, 
"independence of banks" and "commercialization of specialized 
banks" are only theories and not realities, the central bank 
does not possess independent and stable economic functions and 
power, and "bank presidents take orders from government 
officials," nothing can be accomplished in macroeconomic 
regulation and control without direct government intervention. 
In the transition from the traditional planned economy to a 
socialist market economy and from direct control to indirect 
regulation and control, more often than not there are 
circumstances in which people have no way of talking about the 
new structure and cannot help but draw support from the old one. 
Here, the self-innovation of the old structure is meaningful 
because it provides suitable space for the gradual growth of the 
new structure. The macroeconomic regulation and control during 
the summer and fall of 1993 was an example. As for the cooling 
down of the property market, its principal target was to 
restrict the development of the "bubble economy" and to avoid 
having already- tight funds flow into real estate in excessive 
amounts, lest the bottleneck constraints in basic industries -- 
including transport, communications, and so on -- be aggravated. 
Moreover, most of the funds presently used in stock and 
property speculation are public funds, so if this a practice is 
not controlled before the establishment of a new structure, 
people can hardly bear to imagine the consequences of the total 
explosion of accumulated contradictions. Meanwhile, it is very 
difficult to maintain a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development as well. 
  The operation of economic policies in 1993 can be summarized 
as "grasping with two hands simultaneously." On one hand, we 
grasped macroeconomic regulation and control so as to avoid 
economic decline and maintain a high growth rate while reigning 
in the excessively heated economy. On the other, we grasped 
system innovation so as to accelerate the pace of national 
economic operation and market regulative mechanisms, while 
drawing up plans for comprehensive reform. Apart from these 
achievements, remarkable advances made by reform in 1993 also 
were manifested in the following aspects: 
<H5>  1. Tackling the key points of price reform. </H5>
  Tremendous achievements in price reform had been attained 
during the first 13 years of reform in China. By 1992, the 
proportions of prices fixed by the market in agricultural and 
sideline products, in the total retail sales volume of social 
commodities, and in means of production were 78.5, 79.6, and 
64.2 percent, respectively. The shares of goods value regulated 
by the market in agricultural and sideline products and consumer 
goods were 77.8 and 83.4 percent, respectively, of which 
industrial consumer goods were 78.1 percent, and means of 
production were 61.8 percent. In 1993, the prices of grain and 
other items regarded as having a bearing on the national economy 
and people's livelihood were totally freed and were fixed 
chiefly by the market. Grain coupons were abolished entirely, 
and the original practice of rationing was replaced by free 
purchases in markets. Although grain trading between peasants 
and the state, and the fixing of commodity prices had to be 
conducted with government participation, yet this participation 
had to act according to the laws governing supply and demand. 
  Under conditions in which the grain supply was relatively 
sufficient, a buyer's market emerged with regard to certain 
commodities, the proportion of expenditure in grain consumption 
dropped, and price rises caused by the lifting of price controls 
did not exert a considerable pressure and impact on residents' 
lives. So this move to cast away traditional concepts and lift 
controls over grain distribution and prices was a timely and 
successful one, thus adding new experience to the "endeavor to 
win opportunities for reform." 
  The change from grain-rationing to market regulation and 
the fixing of prices on the basis of supply and demand shows 
that China has tackled the price-reform problem. This has 
strengthened our confidence in pushing forward the reforms in 
rent and commercialized residential housing. 
<H5>  2. Placing the establishment of a modern enterprise system </H5>
on the agenda. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system is a basic 
item of the reform package program. It has broadened the field 
of vision for enterprise reform, for it shows that in-depth 
enterprise reform does not involve the mere delegation of 
management rights to lower levels and the explicit definition of 
property rights, but is a combination of the two. Therefore, we 
must select and rebuild an operational mechanism for enterprises 
in light of the requirements of fair competition and optimum 
efficiency. There are two basic meanings in this: 1) In 
speeding up the transformation of mechanisms in state-owned 
enterprises, the questions of whether we should take the road of 
practicing a company system in these enterprises, and of how 
many such enterprises should be run by local people, how many 
formed into joint-stock companies, and how many should remain 
unitary state-owned and community-run enterprises, cannot be 
decided artificially by prestipulated targets, but must be 
determined in accordance with the requirements of market 
development. 2) The operational mechanism should be applicable 
to all sorts of enterprises -- including state-owned, 
collective, and private enterprises -- and in order to provide 
conditions for equal competition for all enterprises, it is 
necessary to practice a unified tax system, and to allow funds 
and labor to flow freely. 
3. The initial progress in the establishment of production 
factor markets. 
  Taking the establishment of a modern enterprise system as a 
basic task of microscopic reform, people logically put forward 
the issue of building factor markets. In 1993, the financing 
channels in China tended to become diversified, the volume of 
free trade in money markets increased to some extent, and in 
foreign exchange swap markets, in particular, the government 
reduced restrictions on quotas and widened the range for 
automatic regulation of market supply and demand. Under the 
dangerous situation of uncommon depreciation of the yuan, 
instead of artificially restricting its exchange rate, we raised 
interest rates on one hand, while on the other, we sold 
government gold and foreign exchange reserves in large 
quantities to narrow the supply-and-demand gap in foreign 
exchange. In addition, we changed the methods by which 
residents and enterprises anticipated currency value 
fluctuations so as to stabilize money markets. By so doing, we 
not only avoided posting obstacles for future in-depth monetary 
reform, but demonstrated the possibility and feasibility of 
establishing a unified exchange rate system in China. 
  In a country like China which has an almost unlimited supply 
of labor, the growth of labor markets, and particularly the 
formation of labor markets in the state-owned economic sphere, 
will be a major reform project. In 1993, initial progress was 
made in two aspects with regard to the growth of labor markets 
in the state-owned economy: 1) Internal labor markets came into 
being, and the practice of "one factory, two systems" regarding 
arrangements for positions increased the flexibility of capital 
and labor reorganization in enterprises; 2) Second-occupation 
markets took shape which smashed the previous convention that 
labor was not allowed to flow between state and nonstate 
enterprises. 
<H5>  4. The accelerated development of the private economy. </H5>
  Another major reform achievement in 1993 was the accelerated 
development of the private and individual economies with the 
following characteristics: 1) The number of newly registered 
units grew rapidly. Taking the first quarter of 1993 as an 
example, on the basis of 15.53 million individual industrial and 
commercial units having been registered across the country in 
1992, a total of 153,000 units was newly added, representing an 
increase of 10 percent or so. In Shanghai, the net increase in 
the first half of last year reached 2,000 units, with an average 
of 10 units going into operation each day, and in Dalian, the 
registered units in the first half of 1993 came to 1,284, a 
growth of 540 percent. 2) Private sectors held stocks in 
state-owned enterprises, which was particularly conspicuous in 
rural areas and the southeastern coastal region. In the city of 
Huzhou, in Zhejiang Province, all the 34 state-owned or 
town-and-township collectively owned silk industry enterprises 
succeeded in operating as joint ventures, with individuals 
holding 60 to 80 percent of the shares. At present, individual 
and private owners are trying to gain access to large cities, as 
well as to state-owned and collective economies with a promising 
development momentum. Although this was not brought about by 
the obvious introduction of reform measures, and although -- in 
a certain sense -- they can be regarded as "spontaneous reform," 
yet they are closely related to the government's policy on the 
relaxation of the ownership structure. 
<H5>  5. Initial achievements in reform of the social insurance </H5>
system. 
  Since the beginning of the 1990's, the nationwide reforms in 
the areas of medical care, housing, retirement, and provision 
for old age have been placed in an important position. However, 
it was not until the publication of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
remarks during his south China tour that the reform process was 
expedited, and 1993 was the year in which these reforms were 
noticeably precipitated. Take the reform in publicly owned 
residential premises as an example. The method of "walking on 
two legs," which meant "raising rents while making allowances" 
or selling at preferential prices, was employed in various 
localities. In the practice of raising rents while making 
allowances, the aim was achieved in either one or three steps. 
Although rents and sales prices were generally on the low side 
and a relatively great difference existed between them and 
market prices, so that consideration of thoroughgoing reform 
measures was necessary, yet it was very important to take the 
first step. Similarly, it was unrealistic to reform the welfare 
system at one go. 
  In addition to the efforts made in 1993, other reform 
actions 
also were taken in the areas of government administrative 
bodies, security of tax distribution, enterprise external 
environment, and so on. However, reforms in these areas 
generally did not extricate themselves from the framework of the 
traditional planned economy. Judging from the requirements for 
the overall growth of a new economic structure, they obviously 
lagged behind, which was precisely the essential root cause of 
conflicts and problems existing in the current dual-track system. 
  The Background of the New Structure: Contradictions 
and Difficulties 
  Reform has entered a new stage. Previously, it was advancing 
on a superficial level, at a low speed, and by partial 
coordination; now it is advancing on a profound level, with a 
higher speed, and by overall coordination. Hence, reform cannot 
be plain sailing, and will be confronted with a number of 
contradictions and difficulties. If we say that what reform 
faced in the 1980's was the unitary structure of the traditional 
planned economy, under which all neglected things waited to be 
done and people longed for change so that something could be 
accomplished, even though reform was being conducted on a 
superficial level, then in the 1990's, when reform is faced with 
the frictions caused by the dual-track system, it is even more 
difficult to carry out reform in an overall and coordinated way 
and to make further advances on a profound level. Moreover, 
reform in the areas of property right structure, reorganization 
of employment, the transformation from welfare on ration to 
welfare entirely on the basis of the market, a remolded 
financial system of competitive banks, the rebuilding of 
government functions in line with the requirements of a market 
economy, and so on -- which are the primary tasks for reform at 
the new stage -- may be confronted with challenges from vested 
interests in various quarters, so that there probably will be 
new contradictions and difficulties in the economic reality and 
reform process. 
  First, although the transformation of operational mechanisms 
in enterprises--particularly in state-owned enterprises -- was 
proposed several years ago, and the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system was put forward in 1993, it was very difficult 
to effect a fundamental breakthrough in reality. A few years 
ago, quite a few people were accustomed to attributing this to 
our failing to emancipate our minds and to our outmoded 
theoretical understanding, but in fact the issue is not as 
simple as that. If we say that before the Third Plenary Session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee there really was a task of 
breaking down traditional concepts on the reform of state-owned 
property rights, then since the ideas of "explicitly defining 
property rights" and accelerating property rights reform were 
written in the plenum's "Decisions," people have acquired common 
understanding now. So will the transformation of operational 
mechanisms in state-owned enterprises and the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system be achieved because of this? No, they 
will not. 
  The transformation of operational mechanisms in state-owned 
enterprises and the establishment of a modern enterprise system 
mean accelerating the reorganization of employment, which 
definitely calls for staff reductions, so that quite a number of 
the existing staff and workers will face reductions in force. 
Once the command [jun ling zhuang 6511 0109 3692] to develop a 
market economy and foster fair competition is issued, it is 
necessary to establish and promote a labor market without 
hesitation. As a result of emphasizing efficiency and 
competition, unemployment is inevitable. This was why we 
proposed the tentative idea of "setting up job markets while 
bringing unemployment into the open" when we were drawing up the 
1987-88 reform program. It is inconceivable to practice a market 
economy without unemployment and without labor markets. As far 
as state-owned enterprises are concerned, the difficulty in 
putting this idea into effect does not lie in the fact that 
workers cannot adapt themselves to such a concept, but in the 
lack of a suitable external environment. Under the present 
circumstances in which publicly owned residences, pensions, 
price allowances, various subsidies, and health insurance 
premiums all are handled by work units, and in which the system 
of government unemployment relief has not been set up, if large 
numbers of staff are laid off and pushed into society, how can 
they get along without wages, residences, and other material 
benefits? Among the current 150 million staff and workers, 
there are 110 million working in state-owned enterprises, 
accounting for more than two-thirds of the total. Even if 
one-tenth of them are laid off, these will number more than 10 
million, and calculated with a dependency coefficient of 1.72, 
this means that more than 27.2 million people may be 
empty-handed and homeless. Moreover, there now are some 100 
million surplus rural laborers in China who have to be 
transferred to work in nonagricultural sectors. An average of 
13 million among the population reach working age and join the 
ranks of laborers every year, and there are 10 to 30 million 
people who may be laid off from collective enterprises. These 
people will constitute enormous competitive pressure on the 
surplus laborers in state-owned units in their efforts toward 
re-employment. 
  It is necessary to resolve the problem of personnel in 
state-owned units who have job titles but actually have no work 
to do, through the mechanisms of bankruptcy, the survival of the 
strong and the elimination of the weak, while simultaneously 
overcoming the difficulty of the surplus personnel available for 
reemployment and ensuring the lives of their families. These 
are the knotty problems of reform for the next two years, and 
also the major contradictions and difficulties reform will face 
throughout the second stage. 
  In addition, the 15 years of reform basically have smashed 
the excessively concentrated centralization system of the past, 
and by delegating power to enterprises and local governments, 
some of the central government's controlling power has been 
shifted to markets and local governments. However, the 
phenomenon of local governments having excessive power also 
exists. At present, there are three problems in the actions of 
local governments: 1) Turning back regulation [ni xiang tiao 
jie 6627 0686 6148 4634] by higher authorities; 2) directly 
intervening in lower authorities; and 3) blockading neighboring 
localities. The aim of all this is to safeguard their local 
interests. Proceeding from the requirements for developing a 
socialist market economy, China must establish a unified market 
and maintain fair competition among various localities, so that 
enterprises will be able to free themselves from the 
administrative control of the central government, as well as 
direct intervention by local governments, whereas governments at 
all levels may act only as providers of services, and their 
actions -- particularly those of local governments -- can be 
regulated by markets, just like all microeconomic main bodies. 
There is still a very long way to go, judging from the present 
situation. 
  Local governments' turning away regulation by the higher 
levels and their actions against control are manifested chiefly 
in the economic readjustment period. Every time the central 
policies regarding structure or total supply and demand were not 
put into effect, the cause did not rest primarily with 
enterprises, but with local governments because when the central 
authorities intended to reduce speed appropriately and rein in 
the heated economy, the localities where the economy was already 
excessively heated would comply publicly, but oppose privately. 
Even though the statistics in their reports showed that they 
had slowed the pace, in fact they still persisted in resolving 
the local employment problem at a high speed and in raising 
their development level. In the area of readjusting structure, 
despite the central authorities' repeated emphasis on 
accelerating the development of transport, communications, and 
other bottleneck industries by cooling down the growth of the 
manufacturing industry, local governments usually defied central 
instructions and put their manpower, material, and financial 
resources into the manufacturing industry because of the high 
added value and enormous profits in this industry and the long 
cycle of basic industries. Consequently, structural 
readjustment was always unsatisfactory, and the obstacles to 
readjustment of the structure and of total supply and demand did 
not rest with enterprises, but with local governments. 
  Local governments' direct intervention in the affairs of 
lower levels is increasingly intense, along with the expansion 
of the scope of reform through the delegation of power to lower 
levels and permission for them to retain some profits. The main 
objects of their invention are enterprises, banks, and peasants. 
They all complain of the numerous kinds of apportionments for 
manpower, money, articles, and charges, and of the "great 
numbers of mothers- in-law." In fact, this was done mostly by 
local government organs at various levels. Direct intervention 
in the main bodies of the market -- banks, in particular -- 
seriously hindered the normal growth of a market economy. 
  Local protectionism or regional economic blockades not only 
led to redundant construction and identical choices of products 
and techniques among localities, but also hampered the formation 
of a nationwide unified market. 
  The non-market behaviors of local governments toward the 
higher, lower, and lateral authorities have become the principal 
contradiction in economic operations and reform at present. 
Owing to the considerable power and great economic strength in 
the hands of local governments, the complicated circumstances of 
uneven economic conditions and interests, and the lack of 
appropriate regulations to restrain the conduct of local 
governments following the reduction of central power, the 
transformation of functions of local governments will become a 
tough problem in the new stage. The pure revenue-sharing system 
can only solve the tax distribution between the central and 
local governments, but cannot achieve the aim of redefining the 
functions of local governments in line with the requirements of 
a market economy. 
  Second, there is the problem that reform of the banking 
system has lagged behind. After 15 years of reform, China has 
begun the diversified development of its financing channels. 
Apart from the channels of taking deposits and extending 
credits, there are other forms of fund-raising, such as 
government or enterprise bonds, stocks, and so on. The 
distribution of funds, however, is still considerably affected 
by the supply system, and in a certain sense, funds have more 
market factors in "external circulation" than in the "internal 
circulation." The reason "internal circulation" has more 
non-market factors can be attributed primarily to the 
integration of banks with the government. The People's Bank of 
China is not an independent and unified body with the right to 
issue currency because it cannot make independent decisions 
concerning money supply and price regulation, and is controlled 
by the administrative officials of the central government. 
Moreover, the placement of loans by various specialized banks, 
particularly by their branches, is restrained by local 
governments, so that they are subordinated to local 
administrative officials rather than to the market. Meanwhile, 
banks continue to maintain state monopoly, reject the mechanism 
of eliminating the weak, and lack competition, so that internal 
circulation funds are controlled too rigidly, the direction of 
their utilization is unreasonable, and their efficiency is very 
low. 
  Under market economy conditions, banking is the axis of 
national economic activities, banks are regulating centers, and 
interest rates are determined by market supply and demand. In 
China, however, banking, banks, and interest rates currently 
remain under the direct manipulation of the government. 
Changing this pattern and molding a new, independent, 
diversified, competitive, and effective banking system naturally 
has become the third theme and tough problem in the new stage of 
reform. The crux here also lies in the solution of 
contradictions between governments and enterprises and between 
the central and local governments in terms of interests and 
power distribution. 
<H5>  The Key Selections in the Process of Expediting Market Growth </H5>
  In the past 15 years, an outstanding achievement attained by 
China in transforming economic mechanisms is the establishment 
of a competitive price system, which represents a change from 
the previous practice of fixing prices in a planned, unitary way 
to one of prices being fixed by the market under the guidance of 
the government. The focal point of reform in 1994 and of the 
entire new stage is the transformation of operational mechanisms 
in state-owned enterprises. Focusing on this point, reform will 
be carried out and breakthroughs made in the following aspects: 
<H5>  1.The establishment of a modern enterprise system. </H5>
  The main battlefield of economic reform in 1994 and the next 
period is the state-owned enterprise, and the transformation 
from the existing state-owned enterprise structure to a modern 
enterprise system. To this end, it is necessary to achieve 
system innovation both within state-owned enterprises and 
without. The theme of internal reform remains the change of 
property rights, while that of external reform includes the 
following three basic aspects: The welfare structure, 
government functions, and the banking structure. 
  In the transformation of the state-owned property rights 
management mechanism, the loudest voice from theoretical circles 
is the establishment of limited-liability companies and 
joint-stock limited companies. It seems that this is an 
inevitable move for the establishment of modern enterprise and 
market systems. There is a wide range of choices for practicing 
a joint-stock system. The numbers of shares can be great or 
small, according to the size of the companies, and both 
organizations representing state interests and residents are 
free to join or to buy stocks. This organizational pattern for 
property rights can go beyond a village, city, region, or 
country, and so is conducive to the circulation, concentration, 
and breakdown of funds. However, in light of the current huge 
scale of state-owned assets and property rights, it may not be 
practicable to set up purely joint-stock limited companies, so 
we must consider a wider variety of choices. Apart from 
developing joint-stock limited companies, we also should develop 
other appropriate organizational patterns, such as partnerships 
and sole proprietorships, and should carry out the change into 
these types of companies through auctions, leases, contracts, 
sales, and so on. In the course of reorganizing property 
rights, without doubt, it is necessary to assimilate the 
"company culture" of European and U.S. enterprises, while 
preserving the "individual and family culture" retained by China 
itself. The economic prosperity of the Chinese communities in 
Taiwan, Singapore, and Southeast Asia has proven that the latter 
also can be combined ingeniously with the modern market economy. 
To develop these two types of property rights organizational 
patterns, we can sell small state-owned enterprises to 
individuals or families, or sell some factory branches to them 
and allow them free choice of organizational pattern. While 
reforming the enterprise system, no matter what methods we 
adopt, we must strictly reappraise the properties, funds, and 
assets of enterprises so as to avoid the loss of state-owned 
assets. 
  Enterprise reform must be carried out both internally and 
externally. A few years ago, no prominent results were achieved 
in the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. This was due 
primarily to the lack of a good external environment. Those 
that should have gone bankrupt and been eliminated failed to do 
so, and the surplus personnel who should have been reduced still 
held onto their posts. This was due to the difficulties in 
re-employment and the immobility of a welfare system based on 
the work unit, so that the dismissal of staff and workers meant 
the loss of various material benefits provided by the units, 
including residential quarters, medical care, pensions, and 
others. As the first step toward accelerating the 
transformation of enterprise mechanisms in the next few years, 
we must accelerate welfare distribution on a socialized and 
market basis. The measures for this are as follows: 
  1. We should institute a socialized insurance system for 
unemployment, old age, and medical care; establish a national 
social insurance bureau; and allow people to set up various 
kinds of insurance companies that assume sole responsibility for 
their own profits and losses. These measures will serve to free 
laborers and their families from worrying about their health, 
medical treatment, retirement, old age, and unemployment, and 
from relying on their work units. 
  2. We should change the current system of residential 
quarters being provided by work units, and let companies 
operating as enterprises attend to the management of all 
publicly owned houses. In the housing reform a few years ago, we 
focused our attention on raising property prices in order to 
reduce the financial burdens on governments and enterprises 
brought about by housing construction. To do so, we implemented 
the method of readjusting prices and selling some housing on 
favorable terms. Still we failed to commercialize housing. 
Here, the difficulty did not rest with residents' insufficient 
tolerance for the increased rents and prices, nor with the 
complicated nature of operations, but in the fact that the 
socialization of publicly owned housing must be achieved prior 
to their commercialization, and that the distribution of housing 
must be controlled by socialized companies rather than by 
different units. It is only after houses are socialized that 
laborers are able to flow freely among different enterprises. 
  3. With regard to enterprise reform, a good external 
environment also contains a flexible capital-rebuilding [zi ben 
chong jian 6327 2609 6850 1696] system. At present, China's 
enterprise system is one under which "workers are always 
workers, while managers are always managers." The 
administrative restrictions on capital rebuilding are 
multifarious, with excessively high "thresholds" and an 
inordinate number of conventions for the registration of new 
companies because their establishment must be subjected to 
examination and approval by several departments, with many 
public seals affixed to their applications. Once they are 
registered, it is very difficult for them to go bankrupt. Under 
a developed market economy, however, things are just the 
opposite. The "threshold for registration is low, while the 
maintenance of their operations is difficult." If the 
above-mentioned abnormal phenomenon is not changed, it will have 
a detrimental effect on the formation of bankruptcy and 
unemployment mechanisms in enterprises. Under the new system, 
when workers are out of jobs and cannot find work in other 
units, they can either pool funds or borrow money to set up 
firms or factories and become bosses themselves. As small 
enterprises grow in multitude, more laborers will be absorbed, 
and more outlets will be opened for surplus personnel in 
state-owned units. 
<H5>  2. The transformation of government functions at two levels. </H5>
  The basic requirement for the establishment of a modern 
enterprise system is to eliminate direct government 
intervention. This calls for the thorough transformation of 
government functions, those of the local governments in 
particular. First, we should separate government functions from 
those of enterprises, run "enterprises without mothers-in-law" 
on a grand scale, and prohibit government administrative 
departments from directly meddling in enterprise activities. 
Governments will be responsible only for legislation, the 
formulation of rules, and the collection of taxes, whereas the 
adoption of stimulatory or retrenching economic policies and the 
coordination of enterprise behavior should be effected entirely 
by market parameters. As for direct government investment 
projects, their development also should be entrusted to 
enterprises operating as companies, rather than being undertaken 
by government administrative organs. 
  Governments will take 
charge of public undertakings only, including the formulation 
and implementation of local tax regulations according to the 
practice of the revenue-sharing system, the management of the 
ecological environment, public investment in local 
infrastructure facilities, and so on. The realization of 
transforming government functions covers the following two 
aspects: The functions of the central government (here, only 
its economic functions are referred to), and those of the local 
governments. In principle, the functions of the central 
government can be defined as: 1) Exercising macroeconomic 
regulation and control over the national economy, which means 
managing and balancing macroscopic employment, inflation, money 
supply, interest rate level, national tax level, and economic 
growth; 2) making arrangements for social insurance at the state 
level, which means providing relief for poor and jobless people, 
arranging the lives of retired and senior citizens, granting 
allowances to ex-servicemen, and so on; 3) undertaking 
interprovincial capital construction projects; and 4) engaging 
in research and development of monopolized natural resources, 
extra large-sized scientific and high-technology projects, and 
national education. 
  Local governments will administer public affairs only within 
their own localities. The fundamental differences in 
administrative functions between the central and local 
governments are manifested chiefly in: 1) The scope of division 
of work, that is, the central government administers overall 
affairs, while local governments handle partial ones; and 2) 
local governments have not the power of macroeconomic regulation 
and control with regard to the issuance and operation of 
currency. The direct relation of governments at these two 
levels to all enterprises is through tax revenue only; other 
regulatory actions must be performed with the aid of those two 
intermediaries: The law and the market. 
<H5>  3. The molding of an independent, diversified, and </H5>
competitive banking system. 
  The establishment of a modern enterprise system calls for 
the 
coordination of a modern banking system. At present, in 
addition to excessive government intervention with respect to 
commodity supply, sales, and prices, as well as employment, 
enterprises still have no freedom in the use of funds, as they 
are still affected by the fund ration system. This is not 
purely an issue concerning the management standards of banks 
because it is due mainly to the intervention of government 
officials in the banking business, the root cause of which lies 
in the fact that specialized banks are not operating as 
enterprises and have not severed their links with the 
government. In developed countries that practice a market 
economy, both the commercial banks -- which operate as 
enterprises -- and the central bank -- which implements monetary 
policy -- maintains the balance of money supply and demand, and 
regulates and controls interest rates at a macro level, are 
independent; direct intervention by any government 
administrative body is against the law. This shows a high 
degree of operational independence in their banking system 
because the banks are held responsible for macroeconomic 
equilibrium. The U.S. banking system is the most developed in 
the world, with the highest degree of independence, whereas 
Japanese and German banks have more intervention from the 
governments. This is not direct intervention, however, and it 
usually is exercised through the law. In designing and 
establishing a new banking system, China can use the experience 
of Japan and Germany as reference, and emulate the U.S. model. 
  Like enterprise reform, there is also an issue of 
introducing 
a mechanism of competition in banking structural reform. At 
present, banks in China are run exclusively by the state, so 
there is no competition among them. Can we not try to set up 
joint-stock banks? People are more wary of this because it is 
more difficult to control banking than it is to control such 
tangible assets as land, properties, and enterprises. If there 
is something wrong with the reform of material assets, it is 
easier to put it right, but if the reform of banking assets goes 
wrong, it will be very difficult to smooth things over. 
Besides, a trade that deals with money easily can make 
exorbitant profits. If the government has no distinct bank 
management regulations, there will be a great disparity in their 
policy-related income. It is necessary to handle appropriately 
banks' tax payments for their profits earned from the spread 
between interest paid on deposits and interest received from 
loans, and the conduct of banks also should be standardized by a 
set of corresponding legal provisions. All this should be 
considered in a meticulous and strict manner. Therefore, we 
should have a preparatory process of legislation and system 
design before selecting a new banking system that takes state 
ownership as a main body with the coexistence of multiple 
ownership forms. When the conditions are not ripe, it is 
inappropriate to set up joint-stock, private, or 
exclusively-owned banks in a hasty manner. From a long-term 
perspective, however, we should take them into consideration. 
Molding an independent, diversified, and competitive banking 
system is the only way to develop a socialist market economy. 
<H5>  4. The institution of a public financial system, under which </H5>
every citizen has the obligation to pay taxes. 
  Enterprises are the main bodies of the market, so the growth 
of a market economy depends primarily on the formation of these 
main bodies. However, the socialist market economy is not 
laissez-faire; in addition to a greater extent and broader range 
of government intervention than in the Western market economy, 
there is another important characteristic, which is that 
redistribution means should be employed to achieve a higher 
degree of equality. Hence, this involves the issues of state 
taxes and of distributive relations between the "state" and the 
"people." 
  The major means to properly handle the distributive 
relations 
between the "state" and the "people" is taxation. When there 
are more taxes, the state benefits, and when there are fewer 
taxes, the people benefit. Before reform, China's tax system 
was very simple, with few categories of taxes and low tariff 
rates, which changed very little. The principal reasons for 
this situation were: 1) There were no private enterprises, and 
state-owned enterprises handed over their profits in lieu of 
taxes; 2) the income of urban and rural residents was generally 
low, so they did not have to pay income taxes; and 3) peasants 
handed over grain to the state as taxes. 
  Some changes have 
taken place since reform, which include: State-owned 
enterprises pay taxes instead of profits; private and other 
enterprises have become more and more important as taxpayers; 
urban and rural residents pay personal income taxes because they 
earn more money; and peasants' payment of taxes in kind has been 
changed to payment of taxes in cash. Along with these changes 
in the tax system, tax regulations should undergo reform, and 
tax categories and rates also should be readjusted appropriately 
through the enactment of powerful tax laws so as to prevent the 
state treasury from being drained off. We failed to do this in 
previous years, and there were some errors in our policies in 
this area because the old tax system was increasingly out of 
keeping with the new economic situation. Therefore, it is a 
top-priority task to accelerate reform of the tax system. 
  Recently, reform of the tax system has been fixed as one of 
the five major reforms. This shows that the central authorities 
have taken the issue of the tax system very seriously. Judging 
from the momentum of propaganda and policy implementation, 
however, it seems that greater emphasis has been placed on 
solving the issue of the revenue-sharing system with regard to 
the financial-revenue relationship between the central and local 
authorities. Without doubt, the implementation of the 
revenue-sharing system is very important because it can bring 
about the distribution of tax revenues among the central and 
local authorities through distinct powers, responsibilities, and 
interests, and thus lay a foundation for breaking with the 
highly centralized financial structure. In the future, 
wrangling between the central government and localities and 
among various localities can be reduced, so that governments at 
all levels can concentrate their efforts on day-to-day work and 
enhance their efficiency. Of course, a new tax system suited to 
the development of a socialist market economy is not simply 
this, and the institution of a unified system under which all 
the people are obliged to pay taxes is extremely urgent. 
  Nowadays, tax evasion has become almost a habit among 
business firms, with those that earn more evading more, and 
those that earn less evading less. If we do not speedily 
intensify the building of a system of legal restraints, we 
probably will go down the road of being a poor nation with rich 
people. The basic starting point of the taxation structural 
reform China is about to implement should be the levy of taxes 
rather than tax increases or reductions. In other words, we 
should collect all taxes that should be collected. We may 
consider instituting a unified tax system under which all the 
people assume the obligation to pay taxes from the following 
three aspects: 1) Formulating meticulous and well-conceived tax 
regulations, including the differentiation of national and local 
taxes, categories of taxes, tariff rates, period, range, 
penalties, and so on. With regard to tax laws, the more 
concrete and detailed, the better. 2) Instituting a strict tax 
report system with a legally defined time limit for reporting 
taxes for a certain fiscal year, under which an individual or 
business owner must file his taxes with the government revenue 
department before a certain deadline every year. If tax evasion 
is discovered, it should be traced using all the records of his 
revenues and tax reports for the past few years, and severe 
punishments should be meted out to tax evaders so that 
individuals and business owners will form the habit of filing 
their taxes honestly. 3) Establishing a tax structure under the 
independent jurisdiction of state tax bureaus at the central and 
provincial levels, and vesting tax personnel with full power to 
enforce state tax laws. No government official is allowed to 
place himself above tax personnel or to reduce or remit taxes to 
any individual or business owner under any pretext. 4) Every 
person --regardless of his capacity, nationality, age, and sex 
-- should pay taxes according to the same law. Consideration 
can be given to practicing a work certificate system, whereby a 
job applicant must possess a work certificate and must show it 
to his employer together with his tax payment receipts. This 
way, the government maintains control over employers, while in 
turn, employers keep control over employees. When a person 
opens a savings account with a bank or an account with a 
money-dealing institution, he also must produce his identity 
card, together with his tax payment receipts. 
  The socialist market economy should operate on the basis of 
an extremely strict legal system, and tax laws are fundamental 
laws for the national economy. Therefore, accelerating 
comprehensive reform of the tax system is an extremely urgent 
component of accelerating economic structural reform as a whole. 
  As a matter of fact, taxation structural reform is reform of 
the state's financial revenue structure. Once we initiate equal 
competition, state-owned enterprises will implement the same tax 
laws as other enterprises, so that state tax revenues may 
decrease in size, and the government will have to cut its 
spending accordingly. This will call for readjusting government 
financial functions. At present, our government finance belongs 
to the comprehensive finance type. Under the original 
financial model of unified state control, the diminution of the 
relative size of revenues is faster than that of expenditures 
after delegating power to lower levels and letting them retain a 
portion of profits, which has led to the increase of financial 
deficits year after year. In 1989, we had financial surplus 
amounting to 2.16 billion yuan, but in 1992, we had a deficit of 
23.66 billion yuan. If we do not adjust the expenditure 
pattern, the deficit will continue to grow, even if we squeeze 
education funds. The fundamental outlet for surmounting the 
present financial predicament is not to increase taxes in order 
to broaden the sources of income, and still less to reduce 
outlays for scientific research and education in order to 
decrease expenditure, but to fundamentally reform the financial 
spending structure. For this purpose, we should move over from 
the present comprehensive finance to a public finance. Except 
for investments in natural monopolies, exceptionally 
large-sized, national defense projects, and some basic 
industries -- all of which will continue to be paid for by the 
government -- funds under government control should used mainly 
for social insurance and other public undertakings. Therefore, 
the institution of a public financial system will be one of the 
basic tasks of reform from 1994 onward.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 14 (XINHUA) -- The Curbo Monastery near 
Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, issued a 
statement today, denouncing the activities of making abroad a 
puppet reincarnated child of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba by 
two fugitive Tibetans. 
  The statement said that the puppet reincarnated child 
granted 
by fugitive living Buddha Shamarba and manager Doga against the 
will of the 16th living Buddha Garmaba will never be recognized 
by the Curbo Monastery and religious people in Tibet. 
  It noted that Okying Chilai, the reincarnate soul of the 
16th 
living Buddha Garmaba or the leader of Kagyudpa which is also 
called the White Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, ascended the holy 
throne in the Curbo Monastery at a solemn ceremony on September 
27, 1992 with the approval of the Religious Affairs Bureau of 
the State Council of the People's Republic of China. He has 
then become the lawful and universally acknowledged 17th living 
Buddha Garmaba. 
  The making of a puppet reincarnated child was a farce in 
violation of the Buddhist dharma and canon of Kagyudpa, the 
statement said, noting that the farce was directed by living 
Buddha Shamarba, disciple and relative of the 16th living Buddha 
Garmaba, and his follower Doga. 
  According to historical records, the statement said, 164 
years ago, Diarqen Ogyainxoi Jiudeqinlinba, the personification 
of great master Padma Sambhava, left prophecy saying clearly 
that the respected name of the 17th Garmaba should be "Okying 
Chilai" who would be confirmed and supported by the 12th living 
Buddha Situ. The 16th garmaba also left a stamped posthumous 
paper, indicating that his reincarnated personification would be 
born in an area north of Sikkim called Qamdo. The paper also 
indicated the names of the reincarnated child's parents and the 
year of his birth. 
  On March 10, 1992, four leading disciples of the 16th living 
Buddha Garmaba, namely Situ, Jiecao, Shamarba and Gongzhu, 
opened the sealed will of their teacher together in the Rongding 
Monastery, where they decided that living Buddha Gongzhu would 
take up the search of the reincarnated child, the statement said. 
  The mission was continued by living Buddhas Situ and Jiecao, 
upon the unfortunate death of the living Buddha Gongzhu in a 
traffic accident. 
  With their assistance, the Curbo Monastery set up a team for 
the mission. Strictly following the instruction of the will in 
their secret searching work, the team came to the Paggor tribe 
near Qamdo, as they were told by the will, and found the 
reincarnated child, it said. 
  On April 15, 1992 of the Tibetan calendar, the living 
Buddhas 
Situ and Jiecao held a tonsure ceremony for the reincarnated 
child before the image of Sakyamouni, the Buddha, at the Johkang 
Temple in Lhasa. 
  On Tibetan calendar August 1 of the same year, the 
reincarnated child ascended the holy throne to become the 17th 
living Buddha Garmaba, in the Curbo Monastery at a ceremony 
attended by noted religious figures in Tibet and nearly 50,000 
Buddhists from home and abroad. 
  However, Shamarba on September 5, 1990 claimed that the 
reincarnated child would be born "in a village by the Baimaco 
Lake, at the northwest of the Curbo Monastery. [no closing 
quotation mark as received] His saying proved to be sheer 
fiction by two searches by the Curbo Monastery, the statement 
said. 
  Later, Shamarba fabricated documents and privately 
designated 
a Tibetan child to be the reincarnated boy, and smuggled him 
abroad. 
  The statement of the Curbo Monastery said the living Buddha 
Shamarba and manager Doga have committed a tragic mistake in 
their deep trap of sin. It also urged them to stop timely 
before the abyss of their sin.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "Regional News </F>
Hookup" program] 
  [Text] The second session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] opened ceremoniously in the 
Tibetan People's Hall in Lhasa on 13 May. Pagbalha Geleg 
Namgyai, chairman of the autonomous regional CPPCC committee,

accelerating Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  Lhamin Soinam Lhunzhub said that while striving to do its 
work well this year, the Standing Committee will place more 
emphasis on the following aspects: (1) We will thoroughly study 
the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and constantly promote common understanding; (2) we will conduct 
investigation and study in an organized way on selected issues 
concerning reform and opening up, the building of the two 
civilizations, and the people's livelihood, and do a good job in

stability, create a good social environment for reform and 
construction, display the CPPCC's unique strength in promote 
unity among all nationalities and maintaining social stability, 
and make even greater contributions to ensuring political and 
social stability in Tibet.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jie (2621 2638) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Gu Yuezhong (7357 2508 1813)] 
  [Text] Zhengzhou, 13 May (XINHUA) -- May 14 of this year is 
the 30th anniversary of the death of Comrade Jiao Yulu. At 
General Secretary Jiang Zemin's request, Hu Jintao, member of 
the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee 
and member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat, gave an 
important speech at a meeting today called by the Hunan 
provincial party committee to mark the occasion. He stressed 
that all party members and people of all nationalities in the 
country acknowledge the fact that Comrade Jiao Yulu was a good 
party member and a good public servant as a county party 
committee secretary whose good example should be emulated by the 
vast number of cadres. Hu Jintao said that emulating and 
fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit is a requirement set for this great 
era, a call made by people of all nationalities in the country, 
and a need for building a stronger party and expediting the 
socialist modernization. 
  The meeting was chaired by Ren Keli, deputy secretary of the 
Henan provincial party committee. Li Changchun, secretary of 
the Henan provincial party committee; and Lu Dawei, secretary of 
the Lankao County party committee, also took the floor at the 
meeting. 
  On behalf of the CPC, Hu Jintao expressed its profound 
remembrance of Comrade Jiao Yulu, its sincere sympathy to 
Comrade Jiao Yulu's family, and its high respects for those 
Communist Party members, cadres, and other progressive elements 
who have fostered Jiao Yulu's spirit and distinguished 
themselves in reforms, opening up, and the modernization drive. 
Hu Jintao emphatically noted: Comrade Jiao Yulu's life was one 
in which he dedicated himself entirely to the party's cause and 
the people's interests. While striving to attain the highest 
ideal -- communism -- Jiao Yulu also worked earnestly, dedicated 
himself entirely, strove to explore, served the people 
wholeheartedly, relied closely on the people, and always linked 
his heart with those of the people. The brilliant image of an 
outstanding Communist Party member and cadre, which he created 
with his personal deeds, has become a majestic monument in the 
hearts of the people. Over the past three decades, his moving 
deeds have educated and inspired thousands upon thousands of 
party members, cadres, and people to move forward, and his great 
spirit will continue to shine brilliantly in history. 
  Hu Jintao said: Our objective at this stage is to build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. The requirement of 
overall importance for the whole party and the whole nation now 
is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider to the 
outside world, expedite development, and maintain stability. 
Under the new situation, it has become even more necessary for 
us to uphold the party's goal of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, inherit and carry forward the party's fine style 
of forging close ties with the masses and wage arduous struggle, 
and emulate and foster Jiao Yulu's spirit. Hu Jintao urged the 
vast number of party members and cadres to do the following: 
  -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and establish the footing 
based 
on the current situation, keep the future in mind, and combine 
efforts to achieve the lofty goal -- communism -- with efforts 
to achieve socialist modernization; firmly adhere to the party's 
basic line characterized by "one center, two basic points," 
heighten their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and demonstrate 
their values while carrying out reforms, opening to the outside 
world, and proceeding with the modernization drive. 
  -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and serve the people 
wholeheartedly, forge close ties with them, do everything for 
them, trust them, and rely on them in everything. While 
deepening reforms, in particular, we must have a stronger 
concept of the masses, adhere to the mass line, understand the 
masses' views, strive to solve the hot issues and problems about 
which the masses care, properly handle all types of 
contradictions among the masses, firmly take root among the 
masses, and serve the people conscientiously. 
  -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and firmly adhere to the 
party's ideological line of seeking truth from facts, proceed 
from practical needs in doing everything, speak the truth, do 
practical work, explore with courage, and work creatively. We 
must strive to have a firm grip of the essence of Marxism -- 
namely, emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts -- make 
painstaking efforts to study and master the scientific view and 
world outlook and methodology, comprehensively understand and 
carry out the party's lines and general and specific policies as 
well as all its reform measures, correctly understand and handle 
contradictions and problems, guard against one-sidedness and any 
tendency of doing things in terms of absolutes, combat 
subjectivism and recklessness, and make constant efforts to 
improve leadership and proficiency. 
  -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and defy hardship, confront 
dangers dauntlessly, fight with fortitude, and make painstaking 
efforts in launching pioneering projects. A great cause needs a 
great spirit. Waging arduous struggle is both a lofty spirit 
and a great force needed to cut through thorns and proceed with 
an exploratory spirit. The spirit of waging arduous struggle is 
particularly needed when we encounter problems during reform and 
construction. We must defy hardship and danger, and by no means 
should we be cowed by them and do nothing. We must make 
constant efforts to make ourselves stronger and proceed 
courageously with an exploratory spirit, and by no means should 
we follow the beaten path and make no efforts to press forward. 
We must work hard and practice economy and treasure the wealth 
created by the people, and by no means should we go in for 
ostentation and extravagance, compete with one another in 
showing off opulence, and waste our resources. 
  -- Follow Jiao Yulu's example and carry out official duties 
honestly and work diligently for the people. Party and 
government cadres, especially those in leading positions, must 
follow Jiao Yulu's example and temper their party spirit, 
consider the party cause first in doing everything, set strict 
requirements for themselves, correctly exercise the power given 
by the people, work hard to provide the people with practical 
and useful services, and live up to the people's expectations by 
firmly fighting corruption. 
  Hu Jintao concluded: Party committees at all levels must 
consider emulating and fostering Jiao Yulu's spirit to be an 
important task of ideological construction in party and 
government organs, an important task of intensifying socialist 
spiritual construction, and an important task of expediting 
reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. Continual 
efforts must be made until success has been achieved. While 
emulating and fostering the spirit of Jiao Yulu, we must also 
carry out the guidelines laid down by the 14th party congress 
and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, and safeguard and promote reform, development, 
and development, which are requirements of overall importance. 
During this process, we must strive to cultivate and bring up 
thousands upon thousands of good party members and cadres like 
Jiao Yulu. Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in 
setting the example with their personal deeds. They must 
improve their proficiency in various fields so that they can 
attain new successes and make even greater contributions during 
the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics! 
  Present at the meeting were Lu Feng, head of the CPC Central 
Committee Organization Department; Zeng Qinghong, director of 
the CPC Central Committee General Office; Zheng Keyang, deputy 
director of the Central Policy Research Center; and Duan Junyi, 
Wang Congwu, Liu Jie, Mu Qing, and other veteran comrades as 
well as persons in charge of relevant central departments. 
  Also present at the meeting were persons in charge of party, 
government, and military departments in Henan.

  [Text] Mbabane, May 12 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC] 
President Li Teng-hui Thursday [12 May] called on Mainland China 
to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and to recognize the 
ROC as a sovereign political entity, thereby paving the way for 
China's eventual reunification. 
  Li made the appeal during a dinner party hosted in his honor 
by the Chinese community in Swaziland. 
  The ROC Government, which has taken a pragmatist policy to 
promote its external relations during the past four years, has 
won recognition from many countries, he noted. "We look forward 
to active participation in international organizations and to 
thus return some of the help we received from the international 
community in earlier years." 
  The president pledged that the ROC would do its best to give 
a helping hand to overseas Chinese in return for their past 
support. 
  Li also expressed his thanks to officials of the ROC Embassy 
and members of the Agricultural and Handicraft Missions in 
Swaziland, saying their sustained efforts have greatly enhanced 
friendly relations between the two countries, and helped 
Swaziland become a staunch ally of the ROC. 
  Li and his entourage arrived in Mbabane at noon for a 
three-day state visit, marking the first time an ROC president 
has visited Swaziland since the two countries established 
diplomatic ties in 1968. 
  King Mswati III greeted Li at the airport and later 
entertained him at a luncheon party. 
  Mswati told Li that he will do his part to cement the 
cordial 
relationship between the two countries. The king expressed the 
hope that Taiwan's successful experience in economic development 
could help rebuild the Swazi economy. 
  "I was greatly impressed with Taiwan's rapid economic 
development during my visit in 1989," he said. 
  The king said he has been particularly grateful for the 
assistance the ROC Agricultural and Handicraft Missions have 
given to his country. 
  President Li, in return, thanked the king for his warm 
hospitality and for Swaziland's full support for the ROC bid to 
join the United Nations. 
  Swaziland is the final leg of Li's four-nation tour. He has 
already visited Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and South Africa, and is 
scheduled to return to Taipei Monday.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
returned to Taipei Monday [16 May] after a 3-day four-nation 
state visit. 
  President Li was greeted by many high-ranking officials, 
including Vice President Li Yuan-zu, at Sungshan Airport in 
downtown Taipei. 
  Li did not make any formal statements on his trip at the 
airport. He may meet the press on May 26 to explain the 
significance of his four-nation state visit, government sources 
said. 
  Accompanied by a large entourage, Li began his global tour 
aboard a chartered China Airlines plane, which took him to 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland. 
  Li made a stopover at Singapore's Changi International 
Airport on his return flight from South Africa. Many senior 
Singaporean officials, including Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, 
greeted Li at the airport, television news reports said. 
  Li's four-nation visit aimed to strengthen the Republic of 
China [ROC]'s diplomatic ties with its allies. Li signed joint 
communiques with heads of state of Nicaragua, Costa Rica and 
Swaziland pledging to further strengthen cooperation in various 
fields. Li also met with the new South African president, 
Nelson Mandela, during his stay in Pretoria. Li and Mandela 
reaffirmed their determination to further boost bilateral ties. 
  This was Li's first official overseas trip since he assumed 
the presidency in 1988. Li made an unofficial visit to 
Singapore in 1989 and to the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand 
early this year as part of his effort to promote Taiwan's 
substantive relations with other countries and to increase 
Taiwan's presence in the world arena. Taiwan does not maintain 
diplomatic ties with the four Southeast Asian nations.

possibility of setting up ties or an official channel of 
communication with Pyongyang while it tries to develop a 
substantive relationship with Seoul, Prime Minister Lien Chan 
said Friday. [13 May] 
  Lien, answering a question put to him by Legislator Parris 
Chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party during an 
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, said ties with 
North Korea would still be considered although the ROC and South 
Korea have been trying to rebuild their relationship since they 
broke off formal ties in 1992, when Seoul switched recognition 
to Beijing. 
  Meanwhile, in a bid to respond to the market diversification 
policy set by the goverment, the China external trade 
development council has decided to send a trade delegation to 
North Korea to enhance bilateral economic ties, the Ministry of 
Economic Affairs said. 
  Bilateral trade between Taiwan and North Korea totaled just 
U.S.$7 million last year, with Pyongyang enjoying a surplus with 
Taiwan. Taiwan exports to North Korea are mainly shoe parts and 
metal molds, while North Korean imports here are largely 
agricultural and textile products, Lin Yi-fu, deputy director of 
the Board of Foreign Trade, said. 
  Currently, Mainland China and Cuba are the only two markets 
with which local traders are not allowed to do business since 
the government lifted the trade ban with North Korea in 1992, 
Lin added.

<F P=106> [YONHAP report from Taipei] </F>
  [Text] Lien Chan, president of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, 
revealed on 13 May that Taiwan does not discard the possibility 
of improving relations with North Korea. 
  While making a speech at the National Assembly on 13 May, 
Lien Chan said: "Taiwan is gradually developing practical 
relations with the ROK, but this does not mean that it will 
discard the possibility of development of diplomatic relations 
with North Korea." He added: "There is no reason for Taiwan to 
avoid the establishment of official channels for dialogue with 
North Korea." 
  Currently, Taiwan has established diplomatic relations with 
29 countries. If it improves relations with North Korea, it 
would be a breakthrough in settling the North Korean economic 
crisis. It seems that it will also bring about a setback in 
restoring economic relations between ROK and Taiwan. Taiwan 
severed diplomatic relations with the ROK in August 1992 when 
the ROK established diplomatic relations with China. In 
November 1993, the ROK and Taiwan established missions in each 
other's countries. Nevertheless, Taiwan is continuing to 
maintain tense practices with the ROK, such as continuing import 
restrictions on ROK products, including automobiles. 
  Right after severing diplomatic relations with the ROK, 
Taiwan sought to improve relations with North Korea as part of a 
retaliation against the ROK, but has retained its `North Korean 
card' because it had decided at that time that it does not have 
great practical benefits.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Construction of Taiwan's 
first software industry park got underway Saturday [14 May] as 
part of the government's effort to boost Taiwan's role in the 
world software industry. 
  Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Nankang 
Software Industry Park, Premier Lien Chan said the park is 
expected to provide a good environment for the research and 
development of computer software in Taiwan. 
  The park in suburban Taipei is part of a government 
five-year 
plan to raise Taiwan's annual computer software production to NT 
[New Taiwan] $90 billion (U.S.$3.34 billion) from the current 
NT$26 billion (U.S.$98.11 million), Lien said. 
  "We hope local business groups will invest in the park to 
help boost the growth of the promising industry and make Taiwan 
one of the world's major software development centers," Lien 
said. 
  Construction of the 4.03-hectare park, scheduled to be 
completed in 1995, will cost an estimated NT$9 billion 
(U.S.$339.62 million). The land is owned by the state-run Taiwan 
Fertilizer Corp., but the Shih Cheng Development Co., a joint 
venture of several private business groups, is a major investor 
in the project. 
  Shih Cheng promised to build first-rate plants and other 
related facilities in the park, which will be able to 
accommodate more than 150 software companies. 
  The park will be administered by a special committee to be 
formed by senior executives from Shih Cheng and companies 
investing in the park instead of being managed by government 
authorities as the Hsinchu science-based industrial park in 
northern Taiwan. 
  Nevertheless, the government will invest billions of dollars 
in constructing transport and telecommunications facilities 
inside the park and its surrounding areas to help attract 
investors to the park, ranking officials said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- The suspicious issues 
surrounding the March 31 killing of 24 Taiwan tourists on Lake 
Qiandao in Zhejiang Province remain unanswered by mainland 
authorities. 
  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] Deputy Secretary General 
Hsu Hui-you, who led a delegation of criminal investigators and 
relatives of the Taiwan victims on a fact-finding trip to the 
mainland, gave a press briefing at Chiang Kai-shek International 
Airport upon his return to Taiwan. 
  The mainland still was trying to "cover up something" about 
the tragedy, though it did make great efforts to arrange the 
trip, Hsu said. 
  The ill-fated Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and 
crew members were robbed and burned to death in a lower cabin of 
the pleasure boat on which they were touring the lake in 
Zhejiang Province, 
  Beijing originally claimed the tragedy was "accidental," and 
then, after strong questioning by relatives of the Taiwan 
victims, said "sabotage" could not be ruled out. 
  Reporters, especially those from Taiwan, were barred from 
covering the news and relatives of the Taiwan victims who rushed 
to the crime scene, were confined to a hotel. 
  Beijing finally arrested four suspects for their involvement 
in the incident after furious Taiwan citizens launched a boycott 
of mainland tourism and Taipei suspended cultural and economic 
exchanges with the mainland. 
  During the past week, Hsu and his delegation visited the 
lake 
and boat, and met with mainland investigators to ask them to 
clear up the suspicions remaining about the incident, such as 
the numbers of suspects, their identity, the weapons they used, 
how they committed the crime and the process of investigation. 
  The delegation was barred from interviewing the four 
suspects 
and examining the reports of the autopsies which were performed 
on the victims. 
  The mainland authorities, while refusing to respond to the 
questions, criticized Taipei for trying to "politicize" the 
incident by creating dubious points to obstruct cross-strait 
relations. 
  Expressing his dissatisfaction with Beijing's handling of 
the 
incident, Hsu said that he and his delegation did not go to the 
mainland with their eyes closed to "endorse" what Beijing said 
were the facts of the incident.

  [Text] Washington, May 13 (CNA) -- The second round of 
Taipei-Washington talks concerning Taiwan's bid to join the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ended here Friday 
[13 May] with few results. 
  Sheu Ke-sheng, Taiwan's vice economic affairs minister and 
chief negotiator to the talks, said the United States was 
generally satisfied with Taiwan's commodity inspection and 
quarantine system as well as its measures to protect 
intellectual property rights, prevent dumping and minimize 
export subsidies. 
  The U.S., however, as dissatisfied with Taiwan's wine and 
tobacco monopoly system, car import restrictions and tariff 
reduction plans, demanding that Taiwan enforce bigger tariff 
cuts on a number of industrial and agricultural products, Sheu 
said. 
  During the talks, Taiwan promised to further liberalize its 
import trade. Starting July 1, [word indistinct) products will 
be allowed to enter Taiwan freely with the exception of those on 
a "negative list," Sheu said. 
  The U.S. demanded Taiwan remove its decades-old wine and 
tobacco monopoly system before it enters GATT. "If we fail to 
make progress on this old issue, the U.S. might withhold its 
support for our GATT bid," Sheu noted. 
  American delegates were also concerned about Taiwan's "area 
restrictions" on car imports and its plan to raise license fees 
for large automobiles. The U.S. was also dissatisfied with 
Taiwan's high commodity tax rates on autos. 
  It also wanted Taiwan to remove all non-tariff protective 
measures for agricultural products, including subsidies for rice 
farmers, Sheu said. 
  During the two-day talks, the U.S. submitted to the Taiwan 
delegation a list of service industries which it wants Taiwan to 
open to foreign investment. "We'll discuss the issue in the 
next round of talks," Sheu said. 
  The U.S. further suggested that bilateral discussions on a 
government procurement agreement be conducted soon if Taipei 
wants to join GATT by the end of this year. Taiwan originally 
planned to begin talks on the issue one year after it became a 
GATT member. 
  The two sides agreed to begin discussions on the signing of 
a 
special exchange rate agreement in June, Sheu said. As Taiwan 
is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, it must sign 
such pacts with GATT contracting parties before it joins GATT. 
  Sheu said the two sides may hold a third round of talks on 
GATT issues in June. He and his 33-member mission will leave 
for Geneva Saturday to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT 
working party screening Taiwan's GATT membership application. 
  While in Geneva, the Taiwan delegation will also hold 
bilateral tariff concession talks with several countries, 
including Canada, Japan and Switzerland. 
  Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 
1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this 
year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 14 (CNA) -- Lin Yi-fu, deputy 
director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said Saturday 
[14 May] that the government will forge ahead with its economic 
and trade liberalization policies despite their negative impact 
on the economy. 
  "It is unnecessary to worry about the negative effects," Lin 
said prior to his departure for a series of Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meetings slated for May 16-20 
in Bali, Indonesia. 
  Some people here have voiced objections to joining 
international trade organizations, saying Taiwan cannot afford 
the cost of opening its market further. 
  Taiwan, an APEC member, applied to join the Geneva-based 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1990 and is 
expected to be admitted by the end of this year. 
  "By joining the international body, we'll have to open our 
market wider... While that may lead to greater competition 
pressure on local firms, import prices will be lower and the 
competitive edge of Taiwan products will be enhanced," Lin said. 
As an export-oriented country, Taiwan will benefit from GATT 
membership, he said. 
  Lin is the head of the Taiwan delegation, which is comprised 
of more than 10 officials from the ministries of economic 
affairs, foreign affairs, and finance, as well as the 
Environmental Protection Administration, Council of Agriculture, 
and the Directorate General of Customs. 
  The group will attend an investment trade committee meeting 
May 16-17 and the senior officials meeting May 18-20. 
  Lin will present a report on the Asia-Pacific's economic 
outlook for 1994 during the senior officials meeting.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will work with 
Southeast Asian countries to increase regional intellectual 
property rights (IPR) protection, the Board of Foreign Trade 
(BOFT) said Friday [13 May]. 
  Taiwan is paying equal attention to consultations on both 
IPR 
protection and agricultural imports as part of its effort to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), BOFT 
officials said. 
  The efforts include exchanges of information and personnel 
between Taiwan and members of the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN). 
  Besides IPR protection consultations, the officials said, 
BOFT is seeking bilateral recognition of national laboratories 
and cooperation in product verification and quality control 
certification with ASEAN members. 
  Details of the issues will be further discussed in an 
October 
Asia-Pacific meterology conference to be held in Taipei, BOFT 
said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 12 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) 
animals committee meeting scheduled for May 16-18 in Beijing, a 
spokesman for the local green consumers foundation said Thursday 
[12 May]. 
  Foundation Chairman Fang Chien said the Council of 
Agriculture [COA] agreed to attend the meeting after being 
notified by committee Chairman Hank Jenkins, through Fang, that 
he had reached an agreement with mainland Chinese authorities to 
allow Taipei's participation. 
  Beijing had previously said it would not allow Taiwan's 
participation at the meeting, ostensibly because it is not a 
CITES member. 
  Jenkins, a conservation official in the Australian 
Government, said it is important for Taiwan to be present at the 
meeting because issues pertaining to wildlife protection and 
conservation in Taiwan are on the agenda. 
  Both government agencies and private conservation groups in 
Taiwan are hoping to attend the meeting since it will detail the 
future direction of international wildlife management programs, 
Fang said. 
  He said it would have been "unjustifiable" for Taiwan to be 
barred from the meeting, considering CITES has threatened it 
with trade sanctions for its failure to sufficiently stem the 
trade in rhino horn and tiger parts. 
  The COA will be represented by Prof. Li Ling-ling from 
National Taiwan University and Prof. Wang Ing from National 
Normal University at the Beijing meeting. Fang said he would 
also be a member of the Taiwan delegation, along with Ted Ting, 
chairman of the Beautiful Taiwan Foundation, another local 
conservation group. 
  The biennial meeting is a warm-up for the 1994 CITES parties 
meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida this November.

  [Text] Geneva, May 16 (CNA) -- A Taiwan trade mission, led 
by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng, arrived in 
Geneva Sunday [15 May] for the May 77-19 meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) working party on Taiwan's 
membership in the World Trade Organization. 
  Taiwan will also hold bilateral tariff talks with a number 
of 
nations while in Geneva, including Canada, which is expected to 
ask Taiwan to cut tariffs on more than 800 items. 
Director-General Huang Yen-chao will represent Taiwan during 
the talks with Canada. 
  Delegation members will hold talks with the European Union 
and Switzerland on May 17 and May 19 respectively, and Taiwan is 
expected to meet with representatives from Colombia, Mexico, and 
Korea on May 20. 
  The delegation will also exchange views with South Africa, 
Chile, and Australia during the three days of meetings. 
  So far, Taiwan has held tariff reduction negotiations with 
the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Turkey, South 
Africa, Hungary, The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Japan. 
  Bilateral tariff talks with GATT contracting parties are 
considered vital to Taiwan's smooth entry into the Geneva-based 
world trade regulating body. 
  Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and 
is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- The Council for Economic 
Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday [15 May] announced an 
eight-point plan to help the government develop Taiwan into an 
Asia-Pacific regional operations center. 
  If the proposals are not implemented in time, a CEPD 
official 
said, Taiwan will waste its "blue chips," which are integral to 
Taiwan's regional operations center bid. 
  The "blue chips" include an exceptionally good geographical 
position, a lively and diversified domestic market, and an 
industrious and capable labor force, the official said. 
  In its plan, the CEPD said Taiwan should focus on becoming a 
regional air transport hub to promote its regional operations 
center bid. 
  The CEPD added that the ports of Kaohsiung, Keelung and 
Taichung should be refurbished and an island-wide transportation 
system should be developed. The government should also work to 
improve Taiwan's Postal and Telecommunication Systems, as well 
as living standards, the plan said. 
  The CEPD further recommended the government reassess its 
land 
policy, and accelerate development of high technology industries. 
  Rounding out the plan are calls to boost cultural and 
recreational development, the official said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan will never agree to 
a proposed change in its country code for international direct 
dialing (IDD) service, a telecommunications official said Monday 
[15 May]. 
  "We hope to retain the current IDD country code, 886, as we 
have used it for more than 20 years," said Steven Y. Chen, 
director-general of the Directorate General of 
Telecommunications under the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications. 
  IDD country codes are usually located by the International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU), an affiliate of the United 
Nations. As Taiwan is not a UN member, its country code has not 
been formally registered with the Switzerland-based 
international telecommunications organization. 
  Taiwan was first allowed to use the 886 country code in the 
early 1970s through informal talks with ITU and several major 
western countries, Chen noted. 
  Beijing urged ITU to force Taiwan to change its IDD country 
code to 866 five years ago in an attempt to signify its claim of 
sovereignty over Taiwan, Chen reported. Mainland China's IDD 
country code is 86. 
  Chen said ITU has so far not formally informed Taiwan that 
it 
plans to change Taiwan's current IDD country code. 
  "Even if we are forced to change our IDD country code in the 
future, we would never accept the Beijing-proposed politically 
significant code," Chen stressed. Taiwan has resisted the use 
of the 866 code because it might create the misleading 
impression that Taiwan is under Beijing's jurisdiction. 
  As the world's 15th largest IDD user, Chen said, Taiwan 
should not be forced to change its country code for any 
political reasons. "We'll ask friendly ITU member nations to 
help us uphold our present IDD country code," he said. 
  Taiwan was forced to abandon its 785 and 789 country codes 
for international telex services in March after the ITU formally 
allocated the codes to Kazakstan and Turkmenistan respectively. 
Taiwan now uses 769 as its country code for international telex 
services. Local companies said they have received many 
complaints from their foreign customers during the past month 
saying their telex messages had been mistakenly transmitted to 
the two former Soviet States.

<F P=106> [By Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), Central People's </F>
Broadcasting Network reporter; RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei 
(7115 4850 0251), and XINHUA reporter Zou Aiguo (6760 1947 0948)] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- The 10th national 
conference on civic affairs, which has been convened by the 
State Council, opened at Huairentang in Zhongnanhai this 
morning. On behalf of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council, Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central 
Committee and state president, extended his cordial regards and 
high respects to representatives attending the current 
conference, advanced units of civic affairs work, advanced 
individuals, and the broad masses of cadres and workers who have 
been working very hard on the civic affairs front. 
  Prior to the opening of the conference, Jiang Zemin, Li 
Peng, 
Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wen Jiabao, Ren Jianxin, Chi Haotian, Li 
Guixian, Luo Gan, and other leading comrades met with all 
representatives attending the conference and had a group 
photograph taken. 
  The main tasks of the current conference are: Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the 
conference should implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee; sum up work experiences, analyze the 
situation; and study and decide the guiding ideology, strategic 
goals, and working tasks for civic affairs work in the next five 
years and until the end of this century in order to better suit 
the requirements for establishing a socialist market economy; 
serve the reform, development, and stability of our country; and 
make due contributions to attaining the second-step strategic 
objective by the end of this century. 
  Jiang Zemin pointed out in his speech: Civic affairs work is 
very important. Comrade Chen Yi appropriately summed up civic 
affairs work as "helping the party Central Committee overcome 
problems and as solving problems for the people." Jiang Zemin 
said that for decades, comrades on the civic affairs front have 
displayed the spirit of "being like an ox," have served the 
people wholeheartedly, and have worked hard and not been upset 
by criticism. They have struggled in unity and have done a lot 
of arduous and meticulous work in showing concern for and 
solving problems for the masses and alleviating social problems. 
They have made great achievements and have made important 
contributions to ensuring state and social stability, promoting 
reform and opening up, and developing the national economy. The 
party and government are grateful to you, and the people are 
also grateful to you. 
  Jiang Zemin said that the party and the people are placing 
great hopes on the comrades on the civic affairs front. It is 
hoped that you will continue to make progress with a pioneering 
spirit, seriously implement the party's basic line and the 
principle put forward by the party Central Committee this year 
on "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability"; strive to do 
a good job in civic affairs work, and make new contributions to 
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
[passage omitted]

Guixian. Entrusted by the State Council, Minister of Civic 
Affairs Doje Cering gave a report to the conference entitled:

provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities; 
representatives of civic affairs departments at various levels; 
representatives of outstanding townships; representatives of 
advanced workers on the civic affairs front; and responsible

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "`No Conflicts' With America"] </F>
  [Text] The United States and China should look beyond 
their ideological differences for better insight into what they 
have in common, a senior Chinese trade expert advises. 
  "The two countries have no fundamental conflicts of 
interests, either from the geopolitical or geo-economic point of 
view," said Zhou Shijian, deputy director of the Institute of 
International Trade Research under the foreign trade ministry. 
  "What we have in common outweighs what divides us," he said 
in an interview with BUSINESS WEEKLY. 
  Despite the differences that do exist, he said, bilateral 
trade and economic relations will continue growing steadily. 
  "We should be clearly aware of the fact that despite all the 
major or minor skirmishes between the two nations in the past, 
bilateral trade has developed in the fast lane." 
  For example, bilateral relations suffered major setbacks in 
1981 and 1989. While two-way trade plummeted in 1982 and 1983, 
it has maintained astonishing growth since 1989. 
  According to Chinese figures, two-way trade in 1993 was 176 
per cent over that in 1988. Under American accounting 
standards, two-way trade last year was quadruple that of 1987. 
  "The exceptional growth momentum proves that the mutually 
beneficial nature of the two countries' economies is not subject 
to changes by wishful thinking," Zhou said. 
  The potential for co-operation lies in more than just 
economics, he said. 
  Zhou believes the two countries need each other when it 
comes 
to strategic and political interests in the face of the new 
international situation. 
  "The U.S. cannot ignore the fact that China has one-fifth of 
the world's population and has its own nuclear power, that China 
is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is an 
important element for stability in the Asia-Pacific region," he 
said. 
  "Sino-U.S. relations are expected to improve further with 
the 
fall of U.S. hegemony and the rise of conflicts between the U.S. 
and Japan, Europe and Russia." 
  Because of the differences in social systems and values, 
Zhou 
said, it isn't strange to see China and the United States locked 
in skirmishes over some major issues. However, he cautioned 
that the direction of bilateral trade-fast growth -- should not 
be overshadowed by these differences. 
  "Isn't it out of date for the U.S. administration to be 
simmering with debate over whether or under what conditions to 
continue most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status for China while 
most Western countries are helping their businesses to enter the 
Chinese market?" Zhou pointed out that many U.S. senators, 
policy strategists and business executives have demanded an end 
to the U.S. practice of annually reviewing China's MFN status. 
  They argue that wielding MFN renewal as a possible trade 
sanction is a tactic of the Cold War period and no longer suits 
the current world situation. 
  Zhou said the Clinton administration cannot afford to ignore 
the importance of the Chinese market if it wants to keep the 
U.S. economy growing. 
  He noted that China plans to import; $1 trillion in goods 
over the next seven years. 
  "This vast market," Zhou stressed, "will be attractive to 
U.S. and other foreign businesses."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" by XINHUA reporter Huang Huizhu (7806 </F>
1979 3796) with Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin: 
"Developing Russian-Chinese Relations Suits the Interests of the 
Peoples of Russia and China"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 11 May (XINHUA) -- Russian State Duma 
Speaker Ivan Rybkin will lead a delegation to make his first 
official visit to China on 14 May. On the eve of his departure 
for China, he enthusiastically agreed to give an exclusive 
interview to this XINHUA reporter at the Duma building in the 
center of Moscow. 
  Rybkin entered the State Duma as a representative of the 
Agrarian Party in last December's Russian parliamentary election 
and was later elected speaker of the State Duma. 
  When entering his large and bright office, people will 
immediately notice a large map of Russia. His furniture is 
plain and simple. A three-color Russian national flag stands 
beside a large desk. Rybkin is 47 years old, wore a black suit, 
and appeared to be prudent, competent, and experienced. 
  Naturally, Sino-Russian relations are the major topic of our 
interview. Rybkin pointed out that Russia and China are two 
great neighboring countries. The two countries should get along 
harmoniously and amicably, develop extensive cooperation, and 
deepen mutual understanding. Development in this regard suits 
the interests of the two countries' peoples. He maintained that 
currently, Russian-Chinese relations are normal. However, to 
further develop Russian-Chinese relations and to achieve better 
results in bilateral cooperation, both sides still have a lot of 
work to do, and they should make joint efforts to resolve some 
existing issues. Rybkin resolutely pointed out, "The successive 
visits to China by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and myself fully 
demonstrate that Russia truly wishes to deepen the friendship 
between the peoples of Russia and China and to develop mutually 
beneficial Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields." 
  Commenting on the purposes of his first visit to China, 
Rybkin indicated that he is very eager to establish and develop 
friendly relations between Russia's new parliament and China's 
National People's Congress, and to enhance exchanges and 
cooperation between various parliamentary committees of the two 
countries. "I want to see for myself how China's legislative 
and executive organs cooperate with one another." 
  The Russian State Duma speaker has been very interested in 
the experiences and accomplishments of China's economic reform, 
especially rural reform. He said, "I have studied China's 
reform carefully and have found that its experiences are very 
significant to Russia because there are many similarities 
between Russia's and China's economic structures." "Why has 
China's reform been able to accomplish remarkable results? Why 
has China been able to maintain political stability while 
carrying out reform? Why has China been able to attract so many 
investors?..." Rybkin hopes to learn the answers to these 
questions during his short visit of a few days. 
  When commenting on Russia's domestic situation, Rybkin 
stared 
at the large map of Russia on the wall and said pensively, 
"Russia has a vast territory and abundant resources. Russia 
will be able to extricate itself from crises as long as every 
Russian makes efforts to increase harmony in an all-round 
manner, to realize true stability, and to pursue pragmatic and 
feasible economic reform policies." 
  Brought up in rural areas by Volgograd, Rybkin still 
cherishes rural life. He insists on planting some potatoes 
every year when he has free time. He likes to play chess and is 
good at repairing cars. He has a happy family. His wife is a 
schoolteacher, his first daughter attends college, and his 
second daughter is a high school student. The whole family's 
valuable treasure is their home library, which has lots of 
books. The common temperament, interests, and hobbies that he 
shares with this wife have brought warmth and harmony to the 
whole family. Rybkin regrets that after he became the Russian 
State Duma speaker, he was forced to give up his hobbies. 
  At the end of the interview, Rybkin expressed once again his 
hope that his trip to China will further enhance the 
understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two 
countries.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- The Seventh Session of 
the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress 
[NPC] yesterday adopted the "Foreign Trade Law of the People's 
Republic of China." Wu Yi, minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, answered reporters' questions in regard to 
the law. 
  Reporter: What is the significance of the formal adoption of 
the "Foreign Trade Law"? 
  Wu Yi: It is of epoch-making significance in the history of 
our country's foreign economic relations and trade. It is a 
good beginning of the legalization of our country's foreign 
trade and is also an important step to link up with the world 
economy. 
  Viewing the domestic situation, since the founding of New 
China more than 40 years ago, we always depended mainly on 
direct administrative means to govern foreign trade. It was an 
unavoidable method in the initial phase of New China and during 
the period of the enforcement of a planned economy. Meanwhile, 
the scale of our country's foreign trade was quite limited at 
that time, and so this was also an effective method. However, 
after more than 10 years of reform and opening up, tremendous 
changes have taken place in our foreign trade today. In 1993, 
the total volume of our country's imports and exports reached 
$195.72 billion, increasing by 575 times as compared with $340 
million in 1949. Our country has established trade relations 
with more than 180 countries and regions in the world. Reform 
and opening up have altered the situation of monopolizing 
foreign trade by less than 20 state-run foreign trade companies. 
Now there are more than 7,000 enterprises in the whole country 
which are authorized to engage in foreign trade. In addition, 
there are over 170,000 foreign-funded enterprises. The total 
number of enterprises which can directly engage in imports and 
exports has reached some 180,000. It has become more and more 
difficult to use administrative means to effectively regulate 
economic activities of such a large scale. In the course of 
reform and opening up, foreign trade departments, like other 
economic departments, are faced with the situation of "becoming 
stifled when as controls are tightened, and becoming disorderly 
when controls are relaxed." Owing to the fact that there are 
several government departments administering foreign trade with 
diverse policies, commodity wars of various types emerged for a 
time. Foreign trade, as an important economic department, must 
be guided onto a legal track to achieve its smooth development. 
  Viewing the situation internationally, our country's economy 
has become quite inseparable from the world as a result of our 
country's opening up to the outside world. At present, foreign 
trade accounts for 38 percent of the GNP. Further opening up to 
the outside world will continuously strengthen our country's 
link with the world economy. The most important part is that we 
must follow international prctice in administering our country's 
economy. In setting foreign trade policies, we must follow 
international trade regulations universally accepted by various 
countries, such as the stipulations of the GATT. Our country 
applied for restoring China's position as a signatory of the 
GATT as early as in 1986. However, the basic requirements of 
GATT on the trade system of a contracting party include the 
uniformity and openness of that trade system. Without a foreign 
trade law, meeting these requirements is unthinkable. 
  Reporter: What things are provided for in the Foreign 
Trade Law? 
  Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law will make adjustments on the 
import and export of cargoes, technological imports and exports, 
and international service trade in accordance with its 
stipulations. The import and export of cargoes is a form of 
traditional foreign trade, as well as the most important 
component of foreign trade. Technological imports and exports 
means the import and export of technologies, which has developed 
and expanded in our country following the implementation of 
reform and opening up. We have gained a lot of experience in 
these two trade areas, and the Foreign Trade Law provides more 
detailed stipulations about them. The international service 
trade, however, is a new task for our country. It is also a 
rather complex trade area which involves many trades and 
departments, such as banking, insurance, transportation, 
tourism, telecommunications, consultative services, and 
contracts for projects. Each type of service has its unique 
character. Therefore, the Foreign Trade Law only stipulates the 
general principle one must abide by when conducting 
international service trade. 
  Reporter: Would you please brief us on the main contents of 
the Foreign Trade Law? 
  Wu Yi: The Foreign Trade Law is the basic law on foreign 
trade. It mainly stipulates basic principles and policy and 
prescribes the general framework of a management system for our 
country's foreign trade. The Foreign Trade Law mainly 
prescribes the following systems, which form the basic system 
for foreign trade management: 1) The system of examining and 
approving foreign trade enterprises. 2) Besides establishing 
the principle of free imports and exports for the import and 
export of cargoes and technologies, the law clearly stipulates 
items which are banned or whose import is limited. The Foreign 
Trade Law stipulates that quotas and permits be employed to 
manage the limited import and export of cargoes and 
technologies. The distribution of quotas will be based on the 
principle of efficiency, fairness, openness, and fair 
competition. 3) Regarding international service trade, the 
Foreign Trade Law stipulates that our country shall gradually 
open up its service trade markets in line with international 
treaties and agreements to which it is a party or member, so 
that other parties or members can enjoy market access 
opportunities and national treatment. 4) The law establishes an 
antidumping and antisubsidy system which also provides for 
guarantee measures. The system will provide suitable relief to 
relevant industries of our country which are harmed by unfair 
trade practices in foreign countries, or to relevant industries 
of our country which have difficulty undertaking international 
businesses ventures which our country assumes. 5) The Foreign 
Trade Law also stipulates various measures to promote foreign 
trade development, including building import and export banks, 
setting up foreign trade development funds and funds for 
risk-taking, carrying out export tax reimbursement, and 
encouraging the development of businesses providing foreign 
trade consultative services. 
  Reporter: What are the main characteristics of the Foreign 
Trade Law? 
  Wu Yi: The main characteristics of the Foreign Trade Law can 
be summed up in two sentences: First, the law proceeds from the 
national condition. Second, the law gets us close to 
international practices. The building of the socialist market 
economy is a progressive process which cannot be accomplished in 
one step. We fully took into consideration China's special 
national condition when we formulated the Foreign Trade Law. 
Under the present situation where the enterprise operating 
mechanism has not been fully transformed and where the mechanism 
of self-restriction and self-supervision in enterprises is still 
not perfect, entirely abandoning the system of foreign trade 
enterprise approval will result in chaos in foreign trade 
orders. 
  Cases in point are the raging of the "great 
commodity war" several years ago, foreign countries' leveling 
frequent dumping charges against China's export commodities in 
recent years, and the recurrent problem of importing duplicate 
equipment. Therefore, we still stipulate an approval system for 
foreign trade enterprises in the Foreign Trade Law, despite the 
fact that this system was questioned by GATT member nations. 
Regarding commodity and technology imports, we proceed from the 
reality that China is still a developing country. Therefore, we 
stipulate that in order to establish or accelerate the pace of 
the establishment of a specific Chinese industry, and to 
safeguard China's international financial position and to ensure 
China's international balance of payments, China may impose 
restrictions on imports and exports when it deems necessary. In 
consideration of the fact that China's service sector is still 
undeveloped and that China lacks experience in international 
services, we therefore stipulated in the Foreign Trade Law that 
China will practice a principle of gradually opening its markets 
according to signed international treaties and agreements, 
instead of practicing a principle that allows the free import 
and export of goods and technologies. 
  At the same time, the Foreign Trade Law fully shows China's 
determination to bring China's economy in line with the world 
economy. This can be seen in the following areas. First, the 
Foreign Trade Law clearly stipulates in the general rules that 
China practices a unified foreign trade system. Second, the 
imposition of bans and restrictions on the import of goods and 
technology will be based on the reasons and methods stipulated 
in the Foreign Trade Law; the reasons stipulated in the Foreign 
Trade Law are completely in accord with GATT. Third, on the 
issue of providing appropriate protection for domestic 
industries, the Foreign Trade Law did away with the 
import-substitution and administrative examination and approval 
system; instead, it adopted such international practices as 
anti-dumping, anti-subsidy, and protection systems. Fourth, the 
Foreign Trade Law did away with various subsidy systems for 
foreign trade enterprises and clearly stipulated that foreign 
trade enterprises must independently run their businesses and be 
responsible for their own profits and losses. The state 
encourages the development of foreign trade. It will work out 
such internationally-practiced promotional measures as setting 
up financial organizations with the specific purpose of 
promoting the development of foreign trade, establishing foreign 
trade development funds, foreign trade development risk funds, 
and carrying out the reimbursement of export taxes. 
  Reporter: As a competent department for China's foreign 
trade, what kind of steps will the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation take to ensure the full implementation of 
the Foreign Trade Law? 
  Wu Yi: As a basic law, the Foreign Trade Law stipulated 
China's basic policy, principles, and a major framework for the 
management of foreign trade. To ensure the full implementation 
of the Foreign Trade Law, it is necessary to formulate a large 
number of supplementary administrative rules and laws. 
Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation will step up drafting a number of administrative 
rules and laws, including regulations on foreign trade 
enterprise approval systems, foreign trade agency systems, 
anti-dumping activities, anti-subsidy activities, protection 
measures, import and export associations, and border trade 
management.

  [Text] The Tibet regional leading group for evaluating and 
selecting advanced units and individuals to attend the second 
national meeting on commending advanced units and individuals in 
promoting the unity of various nationalities held a meeting on 
the afternoon of 12 May. The meeting made an overall 
arrangement on evaluating and selecting advanced units and 
individuals to attend the second national commendation meeting. 
Principal responsible comrades of the six prefectures and Lhasa 
city and various departments and bureaus of the regional 
government attended the meeting. 
  Danzim, deputy secretary of the regional party committee, 
delivered an important speech at the meeting. 
  To further promote the development of the progressive cause 
of the unity of various nationalities in our country, the State 
Council decided to solemnly hold in Beijing this September the 
second national meeting on commending advanced units and 
individuals for promoting the unity of various nationalities. 
At the national meeting, the State Council will commend 
advanced collectives and individuals who have made outstanding 
contributions to promoting the unity of various nationalities in 
recent years. The second national meeting on commending 
advanced units and individuals for promoting the unity of 
various nationalities has allocated a quota of 19 advanced 
collectives and 19 advanced units in this region to be selected 
to attend the national meeting. 
  The regional party committee and the regional government 
have 
attached great importance to the activities of evaluating and 
selecting advanced units and individuals. A joint meeting of 
the party and government was held in the region on 24 April to 
hear reports and to study how to evaluate advanced units and 
individuals in this region. A regional leading group for 
evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals to 
attend the national commendation meeting was established to 
strengthen leadership over the work of evaluating and selecting 
advanced units and individuals and to make overall arrangements 
for the work. 
  At the 12 May meeting, Danzim, deputy secretary of the 
regional party committee, made a speech. He said: The 
political situation and social order generally are stable, and 
the economic situation is also good. However, because of the 
instigation for dissension by splittist forces and the 
ineffectiveness of our media and educational work, some problems 
and tendencies which must not be overlooked have emerged. Under 
such circumstances, properly evaluating and selecting advanced 
units and individuals in this region to attend the second 
national meeting on commending advanced units and individuals 
for promoting the unity of various nationalities; vigorously 
commending a number of advanced typical examples in promoting 
national unity, and using eloquent facts to demonstrate national 
unity and harmony in this region and the new situation of 
promoting prosperity by people of various nationalities will be 
of particular importance to further promoting the cause of 
making progress through national unity. 
  Comrade Danzim called on leading cadres at various levels to 
pay attention to and to strengthen their leadership over the 
work of evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals. 
The top party and government leaders of various prefectures and 
Lhasa city and of various regional departments and bureaus as 
well as leading comrades assigned to the work must personally 
check the work, make arrangements, and ensure the success of the 
work. Various prefectures and Lhasa city should all set up 
leading groups to take charge of evaluating, selecting, and 
examining advanced units and individuals in promoting national 
unity, and they must publicize the work. Those leading groups 
should properly guide various units to carry out related 
activities on promoting progress through national unity. 
  Deputy Secretary Danzim emphatically pointed out: If 
political problems occur because leading cadres do not assume 
full responsibility and if there are bad social consequences 
because of the selection of unqualified units and people, the 
related organizations and their leading cadres must be 
investigated for their responsibility. 
  Deputy Secretary Danzim called on party and government 
organizations at various levels to extensively publicize the 
significance of this work and qualifications in evaluating and 
selecting advanced units and individuals, to hold various types 
of mobilization meetings, and to encourage the masses to give 
full play to democracy and to recommend [for commendation] 
advanced units and individuals for promoting national unity. 
Various organizations should consider the current activities of 
evaluating and selecting advanced units and individuals as an 
opportunity to create a situation in which everyone will 
advocate national unity, do good and actual things to promote 
national unity, and vie with one another to become advanced 
models in promoting national unity. The whole society should 
protect and enhance the good atmosphere of national unity so as 
to promote economic development and all-round social progress in 
this region.

  [Text] In April and May, the provincial party committee 
held three study courses on Volume 3 of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping. These courses were attended by a series 
of principal leaders at the city and departmental levels. 
Attending were more than 330 people, including comrades in 
charge of the provincial party committee, the standing committee 
of the provincial people's congress, the provincial government, 
the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, and the provincial discipline 
inspection commission; secretaries of the party committees of 
various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities; 
chairmen of city people's congresses; mayors; chairmen of CPPCC 
city committees; and principal leading comrades of the 
departments and bureaus directly under the jurisdiction of the 
provincial government. 
  In these courses, participants mainly studied Volume 3 of 
the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, while studying the 
decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee and relevant major reform measures. 
  While delivering a summary speech at one of the study 
courses, provincial party committee Secretary Xie Fei pointed 
out: It is a good way of doing things for provincial and city 
leaders to study theory, discuss major issues, exchange 
experiences, deepen their understanding, acquire clear line of 
thinking, and promote work. He stressed: Leading cadres at all 
levels must attach importance to studying theory by relating 
major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation; 
earnestly master Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; and master basic knowledge about 
the market economy, as well as about modern science and 
technology, so as to apply this knowledge to the solution of 
practical problems and to open up a new prospect in work. 
  In his summary speech at the completion of the study 
courses, 
Huang Huahua, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, pointed out: Leaders at all levels must genuinely 
regard theory study as an important task, and must make 
unremitting efforts to carry it out.

  [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
is about to sign a contract with the United States to buy 
Patriot missiles, National Defense Minister Sun Chen said Friday 
[13 May]. 
  Sun made the statement in reply to an inquiry by Democratic 
Progressive Party Legislator Trong Chai, who demanded that 
Taiwan step up its defense capability to guard against the 
possibility of attack by Mainland China. 
  Sun, the former president of National Taiwan University, 
told 
the legislative chamber that of the missiles currently available 
in the world, only the Patriot is capable of intercepting 
missiles. 
  He said Taiwan would purchase the Patriot model known as the 
PAC-II, a revised model of the one that functioned effectively 
against Scud missiles fired by Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. 
  Sun said negotiations for the arms sale have been under way 
for some time, and are almost complete. Yet he did not reveal 
the value of the arms sale. 
  Sun also told the legislature that the first squadron of 
locally manufactured Ching Kuo jet fighters, better known as 
"Indigenous Defensive Fighters," will be commissioned before the 
end of the year. They will be equipped with Tien Chien, or "Sky 
Sword" air-to-air missiles, he said. 
  The air force is scheduled to acquire 120 of the combat 
aircraft. Taiwan has also contracted to buy 150 us-made F-16s 
and 60 French Mirage 2000-5s. 
  The army also has completed the deployment of the first 
battery of Tien Kung ground-to-air missiles, Sun said. Dubbed 
"Sky Bows," the missiles were developed by the Chung-shan 
Institute of Science and Technology.

ceremony for a memorial hall to Jiao Yulu and the unveiling of a 
bronze statue to him were held today in Lankao City, in central 
China's Henan Province. 
  Jiao Yulu, who died 30 years ago, was the secretary of the 
party committee of Lankao County in the early 1960s. He 
dedicated himself to the improvement of the local people's lives 
and production. His deeds are regarded as fine examples for 
county officials and officials across China at large to follow. 
  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of China (CPC), inscribed the nameplate for 
the memorial hall. 
  Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political 
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, cut the ribbon for the 
opening of the hall. 
  He also unveiled Jiao's statue, which is 1.5 m in height and 
1.2 m in width. 
  In the hall are displayed scrolls with inscriptions by party 
and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan and 
Liu Huaqing. 
  Jiang Zemin's inscription reads: "learn from comrade Jiao 
Yulu and serve the people with heart and soul". 
  Premier Li Peng's inscription reads: "uphold and carry 
forward Jiao Yulu's spirit". 
  After the ceremony Hu and his party went to Jiao's tomb to 
pay tributes. He laid a wreath there on behalf of the CPC 
Central Committee. 
  Beside the tomb he met Jiao's wife, Xu Junya, and Jiao's 
children and grandchildren. 
  Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan Provincial Party 
Committee, and other leading officials from central and local 
departments attended the ceremony.

<F P=106> [Report by special reporter Mai Ying (7796 5391) from </F>
Guangzhou: "Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun Meet and Have a Long 
Talk at Xijiaoshan in Guangdong"] 
  [Text] According to a well-informed source here, Zhao 
Ziyang, former CPC Central Committee general secretary, and Yang 
Shangkun, former Central Military Commission vice chairman, met 
at Guangdong Nanhai City's Xijiaoshan, a scenic spot, and had a 
long talk free of any external interference. 
  It has been learned that Yang Shangkun earlier came to 
Xijiaoshan from Zhuhai for the summer and recently has been 
staying in Guangdong. Zhao Ziyang went to Sichuan "to set his 
mind at ease [san xin 2414 1800]," but he did not return 
directly to Beijing and went to Guangdong instead. 
  According to the source, Zhao Ziyang was accompanied by an 
entourage of a dozen or so attendants, but Guangdong's major 
officials did not show up to welcome him or see him off, they 
only arranged some security measures. Yang Shangkun also 
politely declined the company of local officials because he 
wanted to ensure a good rest. 
  Nobody knows what these two political figures, who at one 
time were the men of the day but subsequently lost power, 
discussed during their meeting. 
  Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun have a very special 
relationship in the mainland China political arena. Both of 
them were pushed to the top of the power ladder by Deng Xiaoping 
in the late 1970's and rendered meritorious service in 
consolidating Deng Xiaoping's power base and promoting reform 
and opening up. As power was redistributed, however, they were 
both consigned to a state of limbo. 
  Both Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun had at one time been in 
charge of Guangdong and were appointed to the office of 
Guangdong Provincial Party Committee secretary, one succeeding 
the other. When they were promoted to the central authorities, 
they often returned to Guangdong for brief stays. 
  Following the 4 June incident, Zhao Ziyang has been 
basically 
held under house arrest, but he has gradually been given a 
certain degree of freedom since 1993 and has secretly visited 
Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Sichuan to "set his mind at ease." It 
is believed that Zhao Ziyang's recent trip to Guangdong was his 
first since 4 June 1989. 
  Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang have consistently maintained a 
good relationship. Deng Xiaoping, however, stripped military 
power from Yang Baibing, Yang Shangkun's blood brother, with a 
view to protecting and promoting Jiang Zemin in 1992, without 
dropping any hints to the elder beforehand, which made Yang 
Shangkun very unhappy. Consequently, the two families of Deng 
Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun broke off a tradition of close ties 
which had lasted dozens of years. When Yang Shangkun broke his 
leg last summer, Deng Xiaoping sent his wife Zhuo Lin to pay him 
a visit and extend his regards, but that did not result in the 
reconciliation of the two families. 
  Since the 1994 spring festival, Yang Shangkun has had more 
occasions to make public appearances, has publicly made a speech 
in Shenzhen, has summoned responsible persons from the Guangdong 
party committee to hold a meeting, and has aired his views on 
reform in a speech for internal circulation. On the eve of the 
opening of the National People's Congress this year, the XINHUA 
NEWS AGENCY quite extraordinarily reported the speech Yang 
Shangkun had given two weeks earlier. It is generally believed 
that, because Yang Shangkun tactfully turned down Zhao Ziyang's 
request to mediate between Deng Xiaoping and Zhao himself in the 
days prior to the 4 June incident, and due to the role Yang 
Shangkun played in the 4 June incident itself, there must be 
still some ill feeling between the two men. 
  Some scholars, however, believe that Yang Shangkun and Zhao 
Ziyang have each maintained their influence in the military, 
economic and political circles, and the power they would have 
behind the scenes in the post-Deng era should not be 
underestimated. 
  Judged against this background, the recent Xijiaoshan 
meeting 
between Yang Shangkun and Zhao Ziyang has profound significance, 
particularly when one considers the rumors that are circulating 
regarding Deng Xiaoping's poor health and the extreme 
instability of Mainland China's political and economic situation 
on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident.

  [Text] Beijing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The State Council, 
China's highest governing body, has decided to tighten the 
management of trading in property rights of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  In a circular distributed nationwide recently, the general 
office of the State Council said that such trading organized by 
governments of province-level areas is subject to State Council 
approval. 
  Governments of cities below the prefectural level may not 
organize such trading, the circular said. 
  "Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the 
state," it stressed. 
  The transfer of such rights of locally-managed state-owned 
companies is subject to approval of governments of cities above 
the prefectural level, it said. 
  The transfer of such rights of state-owned companies managed 
by central departments is subject to State Council approval. So 
is the transfer of large state-owned enterprises, including 
those run by local governments, the circular noted. 
  Before transferring their property rights, state-owned firms 
must evaluate their assets, including their land-use rights, and 
handle necessary procedures concerning changes in their property 
rights, it said. 
  Proceeds from the transfer of such rights must be used, 
first 
of all, to repay bank loans and make living arrangements for 
employees of state-owned enterprises, it said. 
  The remainder of such proceeds then can be used by local 
governments to aid structural readjustment or fund other 
state-owned companies, but may not be used as regular 
expenditures or to offset budgetary deficits or issue wages and 
bonuses. 
  The circular banned the sale of such property rights at an 
unrealistically low price, the free distribution of such rights 
to individuals and the transfer of such rights on credit. 
  It mandated government bodies to take specific measures to 
provide jobs and social security to workers of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  It also asked relevant State Council departments to promptly 
formulate a set of new regulations governing the management of 
trading of property rights of state-run enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- In connection with some 
problems that have emerged in some localities with regard to 
trading in property rights of state-owned enterprises, the State 
Council General Office recently issued a circular on 
strengthening the management of property rights trading of 
state-owned enterprises. 
  The circular stresses: Property rights trading activities 
organized by provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal 
governments must be submitted to the State Council for 
examination and approval. Trading activities must cease 
immediately, and formalities for examination and approval must 
be carried out if such formalities have not been carried out. 
City governments below the prefectural level are not permitted 
to organize property rights trading activities of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the 
state. The transfer of property rights of locally managed 
state-owned enterprises is subject to the examination and 
approval of people's governments of cities above the prefectural 
level. The transfer of property rights of state-owned 
enterprises managed by central authorities is subject to the 
examination and approval of relevant State Council departments. 
The transfer of property rights of all exceptionally large, and 
large state-owned enterprises (including those locally managed), 
should be submitted to the State Council for examination and 
approval. 
  The circular points out: Before transferring their property 
rights, state-owned enterprises must, in accordance with the 
stipulations of the "Procedures for Managing the Appraisal of 
State Property," earnestly evaluate their assets, including 
land-use rights, and complete formalities concerning changes in 
property rights and the cancellation of registration in 
accordance with relevant state stipulations. Proceeds from the 
transfer of property rights of state-owned enterprises must be 
used, first of all, to repay bank debts and make proper 
arrangements for employees' maintenance. The balance of 
proceeds can then be specially used by local governments to 
support structural readjustment or to supplement the capital of 
other state-owned enterprises that are in need. However, the 
proceeds must not be used for regular expenditures or to offset 
budgetary deficits or to pay wages and bonuses. Departments 
managing state-owned property must strengthen their supervision 
over the use of proceeds from the transfer of property rights by 
state-owned enterprises. Splitting shares of or selling 
property rights of state-owned enterprises at low prices, as 
well as distributing such rights free of charge to individuals, 
are strictly banned. The transfer of property rights or shares 
of state-owned enterprises on credit is prohibited. Enterprises 
must undertake corrective measures if they have already done 
these things. When transferring property rights of state-owned 
enterprises, it is necessary to take specific measures to 
properly provide jobs and social security for workers, while 
doing a good job of handling ideological work among workers 
(including retired workers) to maintain social stability. 
  The circular asks that activities of the property rights 
market and trading organizations be temporarily halted, and that 
relevant State Council departments promptly formulate new 
procedures for governing property rights trading of state-owned 
enterprises so as to establish the standardized and legalized 
management of property rights trading of state-owned enterprises 
and its proceeds. Provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal 
governments and relevant State Council departments must 
earnestly implement the stipulations of this circular as well as 
realistically strengthen their supervision and management over 
the state property of enterprises. Concerned parties and 
principal administrative leaders shall be investigated for their 
responsibility for violating state stipulations and causing the 
loss of state property.

<F P=106> [14 May RENMIN RIBAO commentator's article: "A Rare and </F>
Serious Case, a Profound Lesson"] 
  [Text] Beijing 13 May (XINHUA) -- The judicial organ has 
made a judgment in accordance with the law on the fraud case of 
swindling $10 billion worth of letters of credit, which happened 
in Hebei's Hengshui Prefecture. This serious case seriously 
encroached upon state interests and disrupted financial and 
social order. If we do not punish those involved, we will be 
unable to calm down people's indignation and exercise state law. 
The judgment of this case has demonstrated the fairness and 
seriousness of our country's legal system. 
  We have learned a profound lesson from this case, in which a 
few foreign swindlers created a bid fraud involving $10 billion. 
This is indeed a frightening thing. Had our country's judicial 
organs and concerned departments not taken immediate and 
effective measures, the economic losses and political impact 
would have been unbearable. This case reminded us that, in the 
course of establishing and developing a socialist market 
economy, we must have a sound legal system to guide and protect 
us. It is wrong to think people can do as they wish and defy 
laws human and divine because China is now practicing a market 
economy. All sovereign countries, including the Western 
countries where the market economy is highly developed, will not 
allow criminal activities such as fraud to happen in their own 
countries. 
  We must have some vigilance against swindling activities 
carried out by "foreign businessmen" such as Mei Zhifang 
[Francisco Hung Moy] and Li Zhuoming [Raymond C. Lee]. They 
came to China not to genuinely help China develop the economy 
but to pillage for private gains with wicked minds. They came 
here not to do normal business but to swindle and bluff. 
Foreigners must observe China's laws, and Chinese should also 
observe foreign laws in foreign countries. All people should do 
things in accordance with the law and all people are equal in 
the face of law. Punishing them in accordance with the law is 
to protect our country's normal rights and interests and is also 
to protect foreign businessmen's normal rights and interests. It 
is certain that the overwhelming majority of foreign businessmen 
are friendly, come to China to do business, and observe laws and 
discipline. Swindlers such as Mei Zhifang and Li Zhuoming are 
extremely few among foreign businessmen. The opening China will 
not give up eating for fear of choking [yin ye fei shi 0936 0888 
1683 7380], and will, as always, welcome friends from the five 
continents and receive guest from the whole world. 
  What brought on the $10-billion swindle, besides the 
deceitfulness and craftiness of the swindlers, was the ignorance 
and greed of those who were deceived. Ignorance and rash 
actions, failure to abide by the laws, failure to observe rules, 
and abuse of authority will definitely lead to a law violation 
and the committing of crimes. Ignorance plus greed could not 
have been a worse combination. Maybe they wanted fame or status 
and maybe they wanted money or other personal benefits, but they 
were blinded by lust for gain and they brought calamity to the 
country and people. We should draw a profound lesson from what 
happened. 
  When it comes to constructing the socialist market economy, 
many of us are just like primary school students who do not even 
have some of the very basic general knowledge. Only through 
serious study can we adapt the new situation's demands. Leading 
cadres at all levels and comrades who are involved in economic 
work, particularly that which is related to foreign nationals, 
should, in particular, seriously study the basic law, general 
knowledge, and laws and regulations governing market economics. 
What we are afraid of are people who know nothing but pretend 
that they do and who regard state property as a trifling thing 
-- that is very dangerous. This year, the overall situation 
concerning work of the whole party and nation is to seize the 
opportunity, deepen the reform, open up wider, promote 
development, and maintain stability. When comrades from all 
regions, units, and departments want to ask questions or handle 
affairs, they should have the cardinal principles in mind and 
take the overall situation into account, and should never harm 
the interests of the whole for the sake of partial and local 
interests. Still less should they forget righteousness in the 
face of profits; they should not forget the fundamental 
interests of the country and people just because they want a 
small profit for their localities or units. We should correctly 
handle relations between reform, development, and stability; 
seriously complete all tasks in a responsible manner; ensure 
that we have sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; 
and promote all-round social progress.

  [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- Opinions for the 
implementation of the "five provisions" set out and reiterated 
by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission on ensuring the integrity and 
self-discipline of leading government and party cadres at or 
above the county (department) level: 
  With the approval of the CPC Central Committee, the third 
plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission 
set out and reiterated that the "five provisions" on ensuring 
the integrity and self-discipline of leading government and 
party cadres at or above the county (department) level 
(hereafter referred to as the "five new provisions") are norms 
of conduct for leading government and party cadres at or above 
the county (department) level. These opinions are formulated to 
ensure the implementation of the "five new provisions" and to 
correctly handle acts in violation of the "five new provisions." 
  1. The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading 
government and party cadres at or above the county (department) 
level, including leading cadres and their deputies at or above 
the county (department) level in the party, the National 
People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, and in administrative, judicial, and procuratorial 
organs. Leading party and government cadres as well as their 
deputies who are continuing to perform official duties while at 
retirement age are also included. 
  The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading cadres 
and their deputies at or above the county (department) level in 
enterprises (companies) and institutions (federations) of an 
administrative nature, in trade unions, Communist Youth League 
[CYL] organs, women's federations, the China Federation of 
Literary and Art Circles, and the China Association for Science 
and Technology; in party and government-owned newspaper offices, 
magazine offices, publishing houses, radio stations, television 
stations, party schools, administrative colleges (schools), and 
institutions; and in schools under the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions, the CYL, and the All-China Women's Federation. 
  The "five new provisions" are also applicable to cadres and 
deputies at or above the county (department) level in the 
aforementioned organs who are not holding leading positions. 
  2. In accordance with the demands set out in the "Circular 
Concerning Holding Special Seminars on Democratic Life and 
Meeting the Requirements of the Provisions on Ensuring the 
Integrity and Self-Discipline of Leading Cadres" (circular No. 3 
issued by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in 1994), 
leading government and party cadres at or above the county 
(department) level must conduct inspections in line with the 
"five new provisions" at special seminars on democratic life. 
The inspections must be focused on acts in violation of the 
"five new provisions" after 1 July 1992. Leading cadres must 
take the initiative in correcting these acts. Party organs and 
governments at all levels must organize efforts to 
conscientiously examine and check on the progress of 
self-correction and self-investigations carried out by leading 
cadres. 
  3. Imported luxury cars purchased for the use of leading 
cadres at the county (department) level and above or obtained in 
exchange in seeking ease and comfort after 1 July 1992 in 
violation of the Central Committee's relevant stipulations must 
be replaced by other vehicles which meet current stipulations. 
As for those who fail to check and rectify this issue 
voluntarily, or those who bought or exchanged cars in violation 
of stipulations after the third plenary session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, their cars in question will be 
taken away, with party and government disciplinary actions being 
taken against the leading cadres concerned. 
  Various categories of motor vehicles procured through an 
exchange with or a loan from subordinate units, or purchased 
with apportioned funds by taking advantage of one's authority of 
office, must -- in the first two cases -- be returned to the 
original owning units, and -- in the last case -- funds so 
apportioned must be repaid to the relevant units. Those who 
fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or who 
exchanged with or loaned motor vehicles from enterprises or 
subordinate units, or who bought them with apportioned funds, 
shall be ordered to have them rectified within a specific 
period, with party and government disciplinary actions being 
taken against the leading cadres concerned. 
  The practice of purchasing cars for the use of leading 
cadres 
with loaned or raised funds, or with special funds, should be 
checked. Cars purchased by misappropriating funds designated 
for disaster relief, relief, aiding the poor, or education, as 
well as those bought against regulations after the third plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should 
be auctioned off or sold. The proceeds will be used to repay 
the misappropriated funds in full while party and government 
disciplinary actions will be taken against the leading cadres 
concerned and those who are responsible. 
  Smuggled cars that have been purchased illegally should be 
confiscated with party and government disciplinary actions being 
taken against those who are responsible. 
  In counties (cities) where wages owed to their staff and 
workers remained unpaid (the portion for which the financial 
authorities are to be responsible), cars purchased by their 
leading party and government organs and other wage-owing units 
should be investigated. Cars so purchased should be auctioned 
off or sold, and the proceeds from this are to be used to settle 
pay owed to their staff and workers. Those who fail to check 
and rectify this issue voluntarily or who have violated the 
provisions after the third plenary session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to have them 
rectified within a specific period, with party and government 
disciplinary actions being taken against the leading cadres 
concerned. 
  4. Those who bought houses at a price lower than that set by 
local housing price evaluation bodies in accordance with sale 
prices of public-owned housing approved by provincial and 
autonomous regional people's governments, as well as people's 
governments of municipalities directly under the central 
government, in violation of the State Council's regulations on 
housing structural reform and taking advantage of the authority 
of office, must pay the balance in full. Those who fail to 
check and rectify this issue voluntarily or who take advantage 
of the authority of office to purchase houses by decreasing 
their sale prices after the publication of "The State Council 
General Office's Circular on the Question of Preventing Low- 
Price Sales of Public Housing" on 31 December 1993 shall be 
ordered to pay the balance within a specific period and face 
party and government disciplinary actions. 
  Those who buy houses in excess of state-stipulated criteria 
with the excessive portions not being bought at the market price 
must pay the difference. Those who fail to check and rectify 
this issue voluntarily, or who did not buy the excessive 
portions at the market price after the third plenary session of 
the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to 
have these rectified within a specific period and face party and 
government disciplinary action. 
  Those who take advantage of the authority of office by 
providing preferential conditions to their children, relatives, 
and friends in terms of house-purchase eligibility, sources of 
housing, and purchase prices must surrender their illegally 
gained benefits. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue 
voluntarily, or who have provided preferential conditions for 
their children, relatives, and friends in buying houses after 
the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, shall be ordered to surrender their illegally gained 
benefits and face party and government disciplinary action. 
  Those who use public funds for personal housing renovations 
in excess of stipulated criteria must repay in full the excess. 
Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily or 
who have used public funds for excessive renovations after the 
third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission shall be ordered to repay in full the excess and face 
party and government disciplinary actions. Those who, prior to 
the sale of public housing, used public funds to renovate 
currently occupied houses should be dealt with seriously. 
  Using public funds to renovate houses in excess of the 
criteria for subsequent personal occupation shall be handled 
according to the preceding clause. 
  5. Checks should be carried out on leading party and 
government cadres who, while carrying out their official duties 
within the country, have indulged in excessive dining and 
drinking by pursuing luxury and extravagance and in violation of 
food and lodging regulations set by the central authorities, and 
in excess of local reception criteria formulated or approved by 
provincial and autonomous regional governments as well as by 
governments of municipalities directly under the central 
government. For serious cases which have caused bad influences, 
the offenders should be ordered to carry out the appropriate 
economic compensation and face party and government disciplinary 
action. Those who fail to check and rectify voluntarily this 
issue or who have violated the regulations after the third 
plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission 
shall be ordered to pay the appropriate economic compensation 
and face party and government disciplinary action. 
  After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, responsible persons of relevant 
departments and units found to be pursuing luxury and 
extravagance by receiving leading cadres in an extravagant and 
wasteful manner and in excess of stipulated criteria shall face 
party and government disciplinary action. 
  After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, responsible persons found to be hosting 
with public funds and equipment exclusive dance parties for 
leading cadres in commercially run dance halls and other places 
shall face party and government disciplinary action. Leading 
cadres attending dance parties hosted exclusively in their honor 
should bear a certain portion of the expenses and should face 
party and government disciplinary action. 
  6. Checks should be carried out of those who indulge in huge 
extravagance and waste by capitalizing on such occasions as 
their own marriages and funerals, job transfers, birthdays, and 
housewarmings, as well as those of their family members. Those 
who make use of the perks of their job to indulge in huge 
extravagance and waste should be checked on. Those who fail to 
voluntarily carry out such checks, or who have made use of their 
job perks to indulge in huge extravagance and waste after the 
third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, shall be ordered to do so and face party and 
government disciplinary action. 
  Those who take advantage of their positions to use public 
funds and properties or who accumulate wealth through unfair 
means by capitalizing on occasions such as their own marriages 
or marriages and the funerals of their family members; through 
job transfers, birthdays, and housewarmings must return the 
public funds and properties they have used and pay compensation 
for using them; money and materials received by taking advantage 
of the aforementioned occasions should be turned over to the 
state's coffers. In more serious cases, party and 
administrative disciplinary punishment should be meted out. 
Those who do not actively carry out checks and make 
corrections, or who violated the provisions after the third 
plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission 
shall be ordered to return and pay compensation for the public 
funds and properties they used or turn over the money and 
materials they had collected by taking the advantage of the 
aforementioned occasions to the state and receive party and 
administrative disciplinary punishment. 
  7. Those who borrow public funds for personal profit-seeking 
or illegal activities must immediately return the public funds 
borrowed and pay interest on them for the corresponding period 
at the rate set by the bank. The profits and illegal income 
earned should be confiscated and turned over to the state's 
coffers; party and administrative disciplinary punishment should 
be meted out. Those who do not actively carry out checks and 
make corrections, or who borrowed public funds for 
profit-seeking or illegal activities after the third plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should 
be dealt with harshly. 
  Those who borrow public funds to buy or build private houses 
for themselves or their relatives should, by the end of 
September 1994, return the public funds and pay interest on them 
for the corresponding period at the rate set by the bank. Those 
who fail to do so by this date, or who have borrowed public 
funds to buy or build private houses after the third plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should 
be ordered to return the borrowed public funds and be given 
party and administrative disciplinary punishment. 
  Those who borrow public funds for other reasons should repay 
all the arrears in public funds by the end of September 1994. 
Those who fail to do so by this date and those who have 
borrowed public funds for other reasons after the third plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and who 
have not returned them in six months should be ordered to repay 
them. In serious cases, party and administrative disciplinary 
punishment should be meted out. For those who really have 
difficult lives and cannot return on time the borrowed public 
funds, an installment repayment plan should be worked out and a 
moratorium can be granted after approval. 
  8. In the course of self-checking, problems that constitute 
graft, bribery, embezzlement, and other mistakes should be dealt 
with according to relevant stipulations; any violations of 
criminal law should be transferred to the judicial organs for 
handling. 
  9. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, organs 
directly under the CPC Central Committee, and ministries and 
commissions under the central state organs may draw up specific 
rules for implementation in light of actual conditions and these 
opinions on implementation and should report these to the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the record. 
  Localities and units which have conducted checks in light of 
the rules set by provincial-level party and government organs 
and which have dealt with the problems before the release of 
these opinions on implementation may choose not to repeat checks 
and the handling of relevant problems mentioned in the "five new 
provisions." 
  10. The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection 
Commission is responsible for the interpretation of these 
opinions on their implementation. 
  [Signed] CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection 
Commission 
  [Dated] 20 April 1994

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji met and feted here today a group of Hong Kong 
financiers who came to take part in the awards ceremony of the 
Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation, and held warm talks with them. 
  Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation was founded by Ho Sin-hang, 
honorary chairman of the Hang Seng Bank Limited, the bank's 
veteran directors leung Kau-kui and Ho Tim and Chairman of the 
Board of Directors Lee Quo-Wei, who together donated 100 million 
Hong Kong dollars. 
  The foundation is aimed at awarding Chinese scientific 
researchers who have made outstanding achievements and promoting 
the development of China's scientific drive. 
  During the meeting, Zhu praised the establishment of the 
foundation as a great and kind-hearted action, and expressed 
appreciation to the four donors on behalf of the State Council, 
president Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng. 
  Zhu said the Ho Leung Ho Lee Foundation is the biggest one 
ever funded by overseas Chinese for China's scientific and 
technological cause, is a deed of "historic importance", and 
will help create a social atmosphere respecting science, 
education and talent. 
  The foundation, scheduled to hold an opening ceremony

approved by two-thirds of the evaluating committee. 
  Among those present at the meeting were Ho Tim, Lee Quo-wei, 
world-known scholar and vice-chairman of the evaluating 
committee Chen Ning Yang and representatives of the Ho and Leung 
families.

<F P=106> [By David Healy in London and Danny Gittings] </F>
  [Text] A British trade official has launched an outspoken 
attack on Governor Chris Patten, ahead of his visit to London 
later this week. An official in the Department of Trade and 
Industry, which handles London's trade relations with Beijing, 
said Mr Patten would be told his political reform policies no 
longer had the unanimous support of the British Government. 
  Mr Patten leaves this Friday [20 May] on a 10-day trip which 
will include meeting ministers and Foreign Office officials. 
The meetings are expected to focus on whether the Government 
will accept recommendations in the House of Commons Foreign 
Affairs Committee's (FAC) report -- especially its call for a 
human rights commission. 
  The trade official said Mr Patten was "just too expensive a 
luxury for Hong Kong in terms of our China trade". It is the 
first public attack by a serving British civil servant on Mr 
Patten's policies. Previously, such criticism has only come 
from retired officials, such as former foreign affairs adviser 
Sir Percy Cradock. 
  The official said that, while opinion polls continued to 
show 
popular support for Mr Patten: "At the end of the day it's the 
pound or the dollar in the pocket that counts". 
  "We don't have the same agenda as Mr Patten. We want to see 
trade with China burgeoning, and we see a lot of it going 
through Hong Kong. We think this is the strongest base for 
freedom in Hong Kong," he said. "We're at a dead end. We know 
that, Patten knows that and the Chinese know it too. We've got 
to break the deadlock." 
  Foreign Office and Downing Street officials have insisted 
the 
British Government continued to unanimously back Mr Patten. In 
Hong Kong, Government House spokesman Mike Hanson rejected the 
trade official's attack. "His statements do not reflect the 
British Government's position on Hong Kong," he said. "There is 
an important place for integrity, as well as commercial 
interests, in foreign affairs." 
  Mr Patten is expected to come under further fire from 
British 
business interests in a House of Lords debate this Wednesday, 
sponsored by former Hong Kong minister Lord Glenarthur. 
Previous such debates have seen stringent criticism of the 
Governor's political reform policies. 
  The visit has already sparked suggestions in the British 
press that Mr Patten is bored of the governorship, since his 
last trip to London was only six weeks ago. However Mr Patten 
has defended this pattern of visits, saying it was similar to 
that followed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson. 
  In meeting ministers and officials, he will hammer out the 
British Government's response to the FAC report, which must be 
delivered to the all-party body by the end of June. The ethnic 
minorities campaign for British passports, which was backed by 
the FAC, is also expected to be discussed.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 14 (XINHUA) -- The Sino-British 
talks on Hong Kong's future defense and public order continued 
here today when both sides failed to reach an agreement after a 
four-day talk ending Friday. Sources said the talk would run 
into next week. Chen Zuoer, resident representative of the 
Chinese team of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), said 
that he felt disappointed that an agreement was not reached 
yesterday as expected. Alan Paul, head of the British expert 
team under the JLG, said that they had a "thorough and in depth" 
discussion over the past few days.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Chienping (7115 1696 1627): "China </F>
and Britain Should Still Cooperate on Other Issues; Lu Ping 
Urges British Side to Show Sincerity and Hopes Chris Patten Can 
Return to Britain Using the New Airport"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 13th -- Lu Ping, State Council Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office director, stated his view todays on 
Hong Kong's political and economic problems in an address to a 
seminar held at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse for Hong Kong 
young executives entitled "Leap Toward Beijing." The following 
is the essence of his speech. 
  Lu Ping said: On 1 July 1997, the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] will move into Hong Kong to be stationed there -- this is 
laid down by both the Joint Declaration and Basic Law. However, 
first, it will be small in size and symbolic. As Mr Deng 
Xiaoping said, it symbolizes our sovereignty. Second, the PLA 
will not interfere the internal affairs of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region [SAR] Government. It will merely be 
responsible for SAR defense affairs. Normal public order work, 
including border patrols, will be carried out by the Hong Kong 
SAR's own police force; the PLA has no duties in this area. 
This has been written into the Basic Law which stipulates that, 
in case of a disaster or under special circumstances, the PLA 
can assist in rescue operations or maintaining Hong Kong public 
order at the request of the SAR chief executive. However, this 
will only be under very special circumstances. As soon as these 
special and extraordinary circumstances disappear, Hong Kong 
will once again be under the rule of the SAR authorities. The 
PLA has strict provisions in its mandate. Moreover, the PLA 
will be directed to strictly observe the law of Hong Kong. If, 
for example, a PLA vehicle is involved in a traffic accident 
with a Hong Kong person, the whole thing will be handled 
according to the law of Hong Kong and the case will be tried by 
a Hong Kong judge. The PLA party will do whatever is required 
by Hong Kong law. There will be strict legal provisions on this 
and other related issues in the future. 
  On the current state of Hong Kong real estate and the 
problem 
of the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar link, Lu Ping said: The problems 
with Hong Kong real estate are rather complicated. There are 
many causes of high property prices, one of which is inflation, 
though there are also many other factors behind it. For 
example, the fact that Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. 
dollar. As we all know, the American economy has been 
performing very badly over the last few years and interest rates 
have had to be lowered, whereas Hong Kong's economy has been 
vibrant. But, because of the linkage, Hong Kong could only 
follow the United States and lower its interest rates. People 
find their bank deposits are suffering from negative interest 
rates when compared with inflation. To keep the real value of 
their money, people invest in stocks and the property market. 
  Lu Ping thinks the current property situation in Hong Kong 
is 
highly abnormal. He said: Our view is that the property and 
land prices should be brought down. To do that we need to solve 
the problems from different angles. Increasing land supply is 
one way but not the only way. The problem of property prices 
cannot be solved by solely increasing land supply. Expanding 
public housing and the home ownership scheme is another way. 
The Hong Kong government is organizing manpower to study this 
problem. Our view is that current property prices are indeed 
too high and are affecting people's livelihood and Hong Kong's 
position as an international financial and trade center. If 
property prices continue to rise, the cost of investing in Hong 
Kong will become increasingly higher. Rent for offices in 
Central now is the highest in the world. This is not going to 
help Hong Kong. Why would foreign companies establish their 
Asia offices in Hong Kong when rent and wages there keep going 
up? It is better for them to move somewhere else. One very 
important factor contributing to Hong Kong's past success was 
its relatively low costs, wages, and prices. Whatever happens, 
Hong Kong must not lose this advantage. Only thus can it 
maintain its competitiveness. 
  Lu Ping stated: The property market is now a key sector 
for Hong Kong. A very large number of listed companies are 
property developers and a very large proportion of bank loans 
are property-related. If the property market slumps, the stock 
and financial markets will be affected. So, we must handle this 
problem with great care and caution and adopt a step-by-step 
approach in cooling off the market. Moreover, we cannot depress 
the market too much but must keep a basic equilibrium and 
prevent the market from rising indefinitely. This is better for 
Hong Kong's economy. 
  When asked how Hong Kong can now achieve a smooth transition 
given the present status between China and Britain, Lu Ping 
said: The position of the Chinese Government has been 
consistent: It hopes to secure Britain's cooperation in efforts 
to achieve a smooth transition for Hong Kong. This was, is, and 
will be our position. Unfortunately, Britain changed its 
policies toward Hong Kong and China. You all have read the 
report released earlier by the British House of Commons Foreign 
Affairs Committee (FAC) which pointed out explicitly the 
fundamental change in Britain's policy toward China and Hong 
Kong since 1989, namely from the previous policy of cooperation 
with China into one of noncooperation or even confrontation. It 
can be said that there was very good cooperation between China 
and Britain following the signing of the Joint Declaration in 
1984 and, in general, the two sides were able to iron out 
contradictions and differences through consultations. Some 
people dubbed this the honeymoon period for China and Britain. 
By 1989, however, things were different. By that time Britain 
had chosen to be very uncooperative with China. All in all, it 
is very unfortunate. Lu Ping said: Our position on the airport 
problem is the same -- it is very clear. The Memorandum of 
Understanding [MOU] was in place by then, and it was very clear. 
In principle, we do not want to leave the SAR government with 
any financial burdens and inputs should be kept low while 
returns must be high. Also, a minimum $25 billion must be in 
place for the SAR government to use as financial reserves and 
the debt to be taken over by the SAR government must not exceed 
5 billion. We had thought that with the signing of the MOU, 
these problems were resolved. Go ahead and build the airport if 
you want to. We, the Chinese government, have made it clear 
that we support the construction of the new airport. So here we 
have a case of flying off at a tangent: The financial 
arrangements tabled by Britain would leave the SAR government 
with a debt far exceeding the 5 billion allowed in the MOU. 
Despite this, we were still willing to talk to Britain and we 
did not limit the debt to 5 billion either. It just cannot 
exceed the amount by too big a margin. We hope that we can 
first achieve some progress on the airport financial 
arrangements in the coming Airport Committee meeting so that 
there will be a new airport earlier rather than later. We would 
like to see Mr Chris Patten leave Hong Kong in 1997 via the Chek 
Lap Kok Airport on the Lantau Island and not from Kai Tak 
Airport. 
  When asked if it was possible for him to meet Chris Patten, 
Lu Ping said: As I have said earlier, this calls for 
cooperation from both sides and a good atmosphere. Without a 
good atmosphere, there would not be any result even if the two 
of us sat down and talked for days on end. Very simple problems 
can become quite complicated if the atmosphere is not good; and 
very complicated problems, if the atmosphere is good, can become 
very simple and can be solved very quickly.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] The New China News Agency (XINHUA) Hong Kong branch 
-- China's de facto embassy in the territory -- is re-organising 
its work to focus more closely on promoting reunification with 
Taiwan. 
  With the handover of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 
1997, cross-strait relations with Taiwan will become the main 
task of Xinhua's former united front department which was 
recently renamed the "co-ordination department". 
  In Chinese communist parlance, "united front work" refers to 
liaison, penetration, and control of "friendly" or neutral 
organisations whose cooperation can advance party objectives. 
  Zhou Zhekai, the newly appointed head of the coordination 
department, was formerly a deputy secretary of Beijing's body 
handling cross-strait affairs, the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait. 
  Zhou's appointment, revealed in the Beijing run TA KUNG PAO 
earlier this month, marks a break with past practice when the 
department head was appointed from the Communist Party's United 
Front Work Department (UFWD) . 
  The UFWD, which competes with Taipei around the world for 
the 
minds and hearts of overseas Chinese has only been allowed to 
appoint a new deputy head to the department -- Tian Jin in the 
current round of middle-level reshuffles taking place at 
XINHUA's headquarters in Happy Valley. Until the end of 1992, 
Tian served as personal secretary to former UFWD head Ding 
Guangen, a politburo member and close associate of Deng Xiaoping 
who currently heads the party propaganda department. In the 
three years remaining before the handover of Hong Kong, Tian is 
expected to handle local tasks of the coordination department, 
including the appointment of Hong Kong advisers and members of 
the Preliminary Working Committee as well as local delegates to 
China's two quasi-parliaments. 
  The eventual plan is for the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) to take over all united front work 
in Hong Kong. This was signalled by the internal restructuring 
of the HKMAO last month, which saw the formation of a new social 
and cultural affairs department, ostensibly to breathe new life 
into grass-roots united front work in the territory, which 
XINHUA has neglected in recent years. 
  This will leave Zhou free to devote more time to Taiwan 
affairs. Jousting between Beijing and Taipei is expected to 
intensify in Hong Kong itself as Taipei takes steps to 
strengthen its propaganda work in the territory. Zhou's brief 
could also involve working on more sensitive areas, including 
possible meetings between senior Beijing and Taiwan officials in 
Hong Kong. 
  In his previous posting as head of the general affairs 
department at the Chinese Communist Party's Taiwan Affairs 
Office, Zhou handled cross-strait fishing disputes and illegal 
mainland immigration to Taiwan, the kind of "practical issues" 
which Taipei says could be discussed in Hong Kong. 
  Zhou's work is also likely to involve prodding Taipei to 
allow senior Chinese officials and heads of large Chinese 
companies based in the territory to visit Taiwan. But it is 
unclear whether the coordination department's expanding role 
will conflict with XINHUA's low-profile Taiwan affairs 
department. 
  Meanwhile, the shake-up of the coordination department under 
Zhou has left a bad feeling in the agency. This was because of 
the unceremonious removal of a former department head, Lin 
Keping, who has returned to the UFWD in Beijing. Lin is 
understood to have learned of his removal from the local press.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "News Flow Important"] </F>
  [Text] The statement by Sun Nansheng, head of XINHUA's 
propaganda department, effectively ending penalising Hong Kong 
reporters who signed a petition protesting against the jailing 
of MING PAO journalist Xi Yang is to be welcomed. 
  The move is a promising gesture towards pragmatism over news 
coverage of the mainland's affairs. For far too long the 
country has been shrouded in a Machiavellian secrecy which fails 
to benefit its people or the world at large. Furthermore, the 
first impact of the boycott, which was to blacklist petitioners 
who wanted to cover the murder of 32 people including 24 
Taiwanese tourists on Qiandao Lake, smacked of political 
censorship which boded ill for the future freedom of the Hong 
Kong press. 
  By withdrawing this ban on at least some of those 
journalists 
so that they can cover the next Preliminary Working Committee 
meeting in Beijing, perhaps one can hope for further openness on 
the part of the mainland. 
  At the moment, Hong Kong reporters have to apply for 
official 
permission to report in China. They also have to specify 
precisely what event or events they would like to cover. The 
effect of this is to seriously contain the free flow of 
information from the republic. What, for example, is a 
journalist to do if he were to witness events of great moment 
which have nothing to do with his officially-sanctioned trip? 
What if Deng Xiaoping passed away during his stay? If he 
chooses to write about such an occurrence, he faces imprisonment 
for reporting illegally. And as one now knows from Xi Yang's 
case, such offences can be dealt with extremely harshly. If he 
takes the safe option and ignores the event, not only is he a 
discredit to his trade, he is also indulging in dangerous 
self-censorship without the advocates of secrecy having to 
breathe too closely down his neck. 
  At the end of the day, it is in the interests of China's own 
people to have full, fair, and contemporary reporting. Without 
this, they will never be able to learn fully about the world 
into which they are emerging and to make judgments accordingly. 
Instead, they will be playing with the cards stacked against 
them and open themselves to exploitation by those more 
worldly-wise. The jailing of two Chinese Americans last week 
for attempting to defraud China of U.S.$ 10 billion is just a 
case in hand. Had Chinese bankers been better briefed on 
Western financial practices they would not have been so naive as 
to issue standby letters of credit for such an incredulous 
amount. 
  Efforts to stifle the flow of information between China and 
the outside world will not help Beijing's modernisation drive. 
This, surely, cannot be a situation which Chinese leaders, in 
all their wisdom, could condone.

  [Text] A Chinese official in the territory yesterday 
rejected accusations that the Chinese Government was tightening 
control on Hong Kong reporters working in China. 
  Sun Nansheng, the propaganda chief of XINHUA (the New China 
News Agency), said some reporters who had signed up to boycott 
the mainland's propaganda tours had been allowed to cover the 
Preliminary Working Committee meetings in Beijing this week. 
"There is no question of (China) trying to tighten or limit 
reporting activities in the mainland," he said. 
  His assurance came after a rejection of applications by 
journalists from at least seven media organisations to cover the 
Qiandao Lake incident in Zhejiang Province earlier this month. 
The rejected applicants had all signed a protest letter to the 
Chinese Government against the jailing of Hong Kong journalist 
Xi Yang. 
  Mr Sun said that there was a need for reporters to strictly 
abide by the laws of China while carrying out their duties. "I 
feel that a consensus is necessary; when we talk about press 
freedom it should be discussed under the preposition of abiding 
by the laws in the mainland." 
  On calls for the removal of regulations for Hong Kong 
reporters working in China, Mr Sun said they were needed to 
"protect the interests" of reporters. China imposed seven 
regulations on reporting by Hong Kong journalists after the 1989 
Tiananmen Square massacre, including filing an application 
stating the purpose of the trip. 
  Mr Sun said the rules were a kind of protection for 
journalists. 
  He said 1,700 reporters were given approval to report in 
China last year.

  [Text] Pressure is mounting to scrap a law which allows 
British forces to inspect identity cards, amid fears it might be 
used by the People s Liberation Army (PLA) after 1997. 
  Legal experts said giving the PLA such a power would violate 
the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration. Under the agreements, 
the PLA's jurisdiction is limited to defence and disaster 
control. They are not to be involved in the territory's 
internal security. 
  Legislators said there was no need for British forces to 
retain such powers now that their role in border security was 
being taken over by the police. 
  Under the Public Order Ordinance, a member of the British 
forces is entitled to ask any person for proof of identity, if 
he "reasonably" believes it necessary to prevent, detect, or 
investigate an offence. 
  Senior law lecturer at Hong Kong University, Johannes Chan 
Manmun, said it was "a dangerous concept" to give the PLA the 
right to check the public's identity cards. "They are only in 
charge of defence matters or regulation in riots and not 
internal duties of public order," Mr Chan said. 
  Chairman of the grass-roots Human Rights Commission, Ho 
Heiwah, said he feared the power would be transferred to the 
PLA, whose actual duties were uncertain. "Inspecting one's ID 
card definitely should not be a duty of the PLA," he said. 
"Once the power is abused, the consequences are more serious 
than with the police because there are no checks and balances. 
The line is very clear, according to the Basic Law, they have 
no right to participate in the territory's internal security and 
that's the basic principle for the stability of Hong Kong," he 
said. 
  Mr Ho urged the government to sort out all legislation 
concerning the role of the British forces and to amend all 
unnecessary powers. 
  But officials said the power was needed for the army to 
catch 
illegal immigrants along the border. The army had rarely 
invoked the law, said Principal Assistant Secretary for Security 
Karen Pong Leung kwok-hing and she did not see why the clause 
should be scrapped. 
  However, legislators Emily Lau Wai-hing and James To Kun-sun 
said they did not see such powers as necessary in the present 
climate. 
  Mrs Pong said the government was amending all legislation 
with colonial implications but she did not know how the Public 
Order Ordinance would be affected. 
  The government has said it wants all laws adapted before 
1997 
and endorsed by China in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. 
  Legislators said they would raise the issue in the bills 
committee to be formed to study the Public Order Ordinance 
amendments. 
  Members of the Beijing think-tank overseeing Hong Kong's 
transition held conflicting views. Tam Yiu-chung, member of the 
Preliminary Working Committee's legal affairs sub-group, said it 
would violate the Basic Law if the PLA had the power to inspect 
ID cards. However, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai co-convenor of the 
social and security sub-group, said that, in principle, the 
privileges and powers of the PLA should be no less and no more 
than those enjoyed by the British forces.

<F P=106> [By Doreen Cheung in Beijing and Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] China and Britain are facing a battle over 
passports issued to Hong Kong people before and after the change 
of sovereignty in 1997. The Chinese Government is likely to 
launch its own campaign to promote the special administrative 
region (SAR) passports for local people before 1997, while 
"ignoring" a British request for help in seeking visa-free 
treatment for holders of British National Overseas (BNO) 
passports. 
  China's SAR passport plan will be discussed at a two-day 
Preliminary Working Committee sub-group meeting starting in 
Beijing this morning. A discussion paper has been compiled by 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and distributed to 
members of the sub-group on law and order, who arrived in 
Beijing yesterday. 
  A source said the Chinese Government was almost certain to 
reject an earlier request by Britain to help lobby other 
countries for visa-free arrangements for holders of the BNO 
passports after 1997. "The BNO passport is entirely a matter for 
the British Government. It has nothing to do with the Chinese 
Government. Also, it might not be appropriate for China to 
lobby on behalf of the countries who issued the document," the 
source said. 
  The source said that Beijing would expect SAR passports to 
be 
more acceptable than BNO passports to the people of Hong Kong 
after 1997. "I don't see why the Chinese Government should give 
a hand to the British side to lobby other countries over the BNO 
passports. "The Chinese Government is confident that the SAR 
passports will be accepted widely given that visa-free 
arrangements are mutually beneficial. So long as Hong Kong is 
still an international city people from all over the world will 
expect to continue to have exemption from visas when entering 
Hong Kong. If they want that they will also have to exempt 
visas for holders of the SAR passports," the source said. 
  The source maintained that the British Government might 
suffer if it decided not to give visa-free treatment to SAR 
passport holders. "If they do so, the Chinese Government can 
make similar requirements for British nationals when entering 
Hong Kong after 1997," he said. 
  Speaking in Beijing, the Hong Kong co-convenor of the law 
and 
order sub-group, Rita Fan Hsu Lai-tai, said the promotion work 
for the SAR passports should be launched as early as possible to 
secure a visa-free deal for its holders. She said preparations 
for issuing SAR passports could be made before 1997 but stressed 
that the document would only become valid after formal 
endorsement by the SAR government. Mrs Fan said it would be 
difficult for China to make a commitment that holders of the 
British-issued BNO would have entry to the SAR, which was part 
of China.

<F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] A plan to reform party and government organizations 
in Anhui Province was officially adopted recently. With the 
permission of the party Central Committee and State Council, the 
number of party and government departments in organizations 
directly under the provincial authority will be cut down after 
the reform to 55, which is 15 less than the present 70. 
Basically, the reform will be carried out simultaneously in the 
provincial people's congress, the provincial committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the 
provincial people's court, the provincial people's 
procuratorate, in nongovernment provincial organizations, and in 
democratic parties. 
  The provincial party committee and provincial government 
held 
a work meeting on the reform of organizations directly under the 
provincial authority at the provincial party committee assembly 
hall on the afternoon of 20 April. At the meeting, there was a 
mobilization talk, and specific arrangements were made for 
reforming organizations directly under the provincial authority 
and for implementing the national public service system. The 
meeting was presided over by Yang Yongliang, deputy secretary of 
the provincial party committee. Vice Governor Yang Duoliang 
announced the plan to reform organizations directly under the 
provincial authority and made specific demands concerning its 
implementation. Liu Guangcai, standing committee member and 
organization department head of the provincial party committee, 
attended the meeting. Yang Yongliang delivered an important 
speech before the meeting concluded. 
  Yang Yongliang said: Organizational reform and the 
implementation of the national public service system are one of 
the 10 major tasks proposed by the 14th national party congress 
and are a major event in the political life of our province. 
The effective implementation of the organizational reform is of 
great significance to efforts to deepen the reform in all 
aspects, open up wider, promote development, and maintain 
stability. Leaders at all levels and the vast numbers of 
government functionaries should be more aware of the importance 
of organizational reform; earnestly unify their thoughts around 
the arrangements made by the party Central Committee, State 
Council, provincial party committee, and provincial government; 
adopt an overall point of view; willingly subordinate local 
interests to overall interests, departments to the overall 
situation, and individuals to the organizations; and 
enthusiastically support and participate in reform. The vast 
numbers of party members, particularly those who are also 
responsible cadres, should lead cadres, workers, and staff 
members in organizations directly under the provincial authority 
-- and even cadres, workers, and staff members of province-wide 
organizations -- by setting an example in implementing reform. 
  Yang Yongliang pointed out: Leaders at all levels should 
involve themselves in the organizational reform and 
implementation of the national public service system in a spirit 
of reform. They should use reformative methods to solve 
problems which occur during the transition from the old to the 
new system so that the organizational reform and implementation 
of the public service system can proceed from an advanced level 
in the initial stage. They should focus on completing the 
reform of organizations directly under the provincial authority 
and on implementing the national public service system at the 
fastest possible pace and in a relatively short time while 
ensuring quality at the same time. They should use 
organizational reform to achieve major breakthroughs in 
transforming government functions. They should regard 
organizational reform and the implementation of national public 
service system as the turning point, give government 
functionaries comprehensive public service training and 
education, further change their work style, and improve 
efficiency at work so that an honest, capable, steady, and 
highly efficient national public service team will be formed in 
the government. 
  Yang Yongliang said: The difficult part of organizational 
reform is transferring and distributing surplus government 
workers. We must widen channels through which we can properly 
assign government workers, and we must open channels for cadres 
to show off their talent at the front line of economic 
construction. 
  Yang Yongliang said emphatically: Departments at all levels 
should earnestly strengthen their leadership over this task and 
ensure that reform is implemented systematically and step by 
step. We should enhance our sense of organization and 
discipline, strictly observe all policies for organizational 
reform, and strictly forbid actions which violate laws and 
discipline. 
  In conclusion, Yang Yongliang asked the vast numbers of 
government functionaries, workers, and staff members to stand 
fast at their posts, fulfill their duties and responsibilities, 
work hard at reform, and do solid work to achieve the desired 
objectives for the reform of organizations under the provincial 
authority and the implementation of the state public servant 
system, and to promote the organizational reform and 
implementation of the national public service system.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The tertiary industry has 
become a new hot spot for foreign investors in Fuzhou, capital 
of east China's Fujian Province. 
  According to local officials, more and more overseas 
investors have invested or intending to invest in research and 
development, consultancy services, warehousing and storaging, 
commerce and catering trade. 
  The city approved the establishment of 898 foreign funded 
enterprises in 1993, with the total investment reaching about

  Of the newly-registered enterprises, there are four projects 
whose investment exceeds 100 million U.S. dollars each and 78 
projects whose investment exceeds 10 million U.S. dollars each. 
  The confidence of overseas businessmen has been enhanced and 
most of them have extended the term of their investment in the 
city. In the past, the term of cooperation for overseas-funded 
enterprises is usually from 10 to 15 years, but last year the 
term was extended to 20-50 years. 
  Fuzhou's economic and technological development zone, free 
trade zone, overseas-Chinese economic development zone, Fuxing 
Investment District and high-technology parks have become the 
major bases for overseas investment. 
  Now overseas-funded enterprises have become pillar

  [Excerpts] The provincial work conference on curbing the 
losses and increasing profits concluded in Jinan on 13 May. 
Attending the work conference were Wang Zhongyu, minister of the 
economy and trade; Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee and governor of the province; Chen 
Jianguo, member of the provincial party standing committee and 
vice governor of the province; and Wang Yuxi, vice governor of 
the province. 
  In addition to the existing problems, participants analyzed 
the situation prevailing in the operation of industries, 
communications, finance, trade, and the economy since the 
beginning of this year during the conference. They were 
informed on the situation in curbing the losses and increasing 
profits and made specific arrangements for further doing a good 
job in curbing the losses and increasing profits. Since the 
beginning of this year, the general economic situation has been 
fine. Major problems cropping up in the economic operation are 
as follows: Investments made in fixed assets have been 
excessively large. The scale of price hikes for a number of 
commodities has been higher. The pressure of inflation has 
increased. The circulation funds of enterprises have been 
strained. The default of commodity payments among enterprises 
has become serious. The fund circulation has not been smooth. 
What is particularly prominent is that the production and 
business of a number of industries and trades are facing larger 
difficulties, that the number of money-losing enterprises and 
the volume of losses caused by enterprises are increasing, and 
that economic results are not ideal. 
  During the work conference, Chen Jianguo delivered a speech 
in which he pointed out: Although the current decline of 
economic results caused by a number of enterprises has been 
affected by the factors of enforcing the new financial and 
accounting systems and increasing the volume of taxes; what is 
most important is that the unsuitableness in the fields of 
ideology, work, enterprise quality, and enterprise management 
mechanism, which has been exposed in the accelerated pace of 
reform and in the larger changes of macroeconomic environment. 
Chen Jianguo said: Tasks for curbing the losses and increasing 
profits this year are very arduous. Contradictions and 
difficulties encountered by the province in this regard are very 
many. Under such a situation, we should all the more enhance 
leadership over the work and assign responsibility to all 
personnel concerned. [passage omitted] 
  During the work conference, Vice Governor Wang Yuxi also 
delivered a speech on the work of curbing the losses and 
increasing profits on the fronts of finance, trade, and 
commodity circulation. 
  On behalf of the provincial people's government, Chen 
Jianguo signed a letter of responsibility with 17 cities and 
prefectures as well as departments concerned for curbing losses 
and increasing profits in the 1990's at the conference. 
  Commended at the work conference were 122 advanced 
enterprises with outstanding economic results on the fronts of 
industry and communications, finance, and trade; 10 advanced 
units outstanding in curbing the losses and increasing profits; 
and 105 advanced individuals who were also outstanding in this 
regard.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 14 May, Governor Zhao Zhihao 
cordially received in Jinan the representatives of foreign 
specialists who had made outstanding contributions to the 
province's construction and development. The province has set 
forth the first foreign specialists' day on 14 May. With the 
approval of the provincial people's government and starting this

  In the afternoon that day 15 specialists from the countries 
of the United States, Switzerland, Britain, Germany, ROK, and 
Japan, happily got together in the Nanjiao Guest House to mark 
the occasion. 
  Since the programs of reform and opening up, the influence 
exerted by the province on foreign countries through deeply 
implementing the party's policies of reform and opening up has 
been steadily broadened. The number of foreign specialists and

province's economic construction but also deepened the 
friendship and mutual understanding between the province's 
people and the people of various countries in the world. 
Through the employment, the province has effectively publicized 
itself and broadened its exposure and influence to foreign 
countries. 
  During the reception, Zhao Zhihao first extended

government and the people throughout the province. He also

outstanding work for the province. Zhao Zhihao also briefed the 
guests on the province's situation in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. He urged the foreign specialists to 
introduce or pass their advanced science and technologies, rich 
managerial experience, and educational methods on to the 
province. He hoped that through the work done by these 
specialists the province will be able to further accelerate its 
economic and social development. At the same time, he also 
hoped that the establishment of foreign specialists' day and 
relevant activities conducted in honor of them will lead the 
province as a whole to foster a fine social morale of respecting 
and supporting foreign specialists. 
  During the reception, the foreign specialists and friends 
aired their own views and expressed thanks for the fine working 
and living environments provided by the province. They also

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Hongyang (3076 3163 3152)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Mao Yingliang, head of 
the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of China, said 
recently: In terms of its financial situation, Shanghai 
experienced stable and sound growth in the first four months of 
1994. Deposits at the various banks rose markedly, more 
emphasis was placed on input of credit funds, reform of the 
foreign exchange system was implemented smoothly, quotas of 
treasury bonds sale were fulfilled ahead of schedule, and new 
breakthroughs were made in the construction of the banking 
sector. 
  Speaking of the work for May and June, he pointed out: While 
exercising strict control over credit volume, the scale of fixed 
assets in particular, Shanghai will try its best to meet the 
needs of circulation funds of those state-owned industrial 
enterprises turning out marketable products, offer help to those 
state-owned enterprises that have a good chance of switching 
from red to black, and work together with competent authorities 
in helping enterprises which have suffered losses for a long 
time and, for the time being, are in no position to repay the 
loans so that the basic needs of their workers' livelihood are 
ensured. Meanwhile, more credits will be made available to 
pillar industries in suburban counties, foreign trade and export 
enterprises, and other newly emerged growth sectors. 
  Deposits at the various specialized banks in Shanghai have 
increased by 22.63 billion yuan this year, up 85 percent over 
the corresponding 1993 period. Of which, the accumulated 
increase of urban savings deposits rose by a record 10.9 billion 
yuan, showing an increase of 23.9 billion yuan. [sentence as 
received] Deposits of the various commercial banks also 
increased by 6.1 billion yuan. 
  Mao Yingliang said: Working funds for key state projects in 
Shanghai were ensured from January and April. The city also 
injected adequate funds into a number of burgeoning pillar 
industries and other new growth sectors like the automobile, 
communications, chemical, and mechano-electronic industries. 
Funding needs for the power, cotton, steel industries, and for 
reserve funds of daily necessities as grain, edible oil, and 
non- staple foodstuffs were also met in timely fashion. 
  In addition to implementing reform of the banking structure 
in orderly fashion this year, Shanghai has expanded efforts in 
developing the market and opening up wider to the outside world. 
The China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, which Shanghai 
undertook to set up, has hooked up with 12 cities since it 
officially went into operation on 4 April; over the past month 
and more, transaction prices have been stable and the total 
volume of turnover was US$3 billion and HK$2.66 billion. The 
volume of turnover at the Shanghai Security Exchange from 
January and April was 243 billion yuan, up 58.8 percent over the 
corresponding 1993 period. The total volume of interbank 
borrowings and lendings was 56.24 billion yuan. At present, 
there are over 90 foreign-funded banking organizations or 
representative offices of such organizations in Shanghai; their 
assets increased steadily, reaching US$2,892 million by the end 
of March, up 16 percent over the 1993 year-end figure.

carrying out concrete implementation measures to bring the 
suburban, rural economy to a new level. The decision consists 
of 30 clauses in six parts, namely: (1) Stabilize the 
agricultural base by increasing investment; (2) intensify work 
on the "vegetable basket" project to ensure urban market supply; 
(3) ensure all-around development of the rural economy to 
realistically increase peasants' incomes; (4) deepen reform of 
the agricultural economy to meet the requirements of a market 
economy; (5) persist in actively developing high-yield 
agriculture through scientific and technological progress; and 
(6) strengthen leadership over rural work by introducing the 
administrative chief responsibility system. The decision 
emphasizes the necessity of maintaining acreage of grain and 
oil-bearing crops and their total production volume, adding that 
no one is permitted to arbitrarily change the land use of 
protected grain and oil-bearing crop cultivation areas or occupy 
them to guarantee fulfillment of contractual state procurement 
of grain and oil- bearing crops, and self sufficiency of grain 
and oil among suburban peasants. The decision distinctly 
imposes a responsibility system under which both county and 
district chiefs will be responsible for the production of grain, 
oil-bearing crops, and nonstaple food; whereas district chiefs 
will be responsible for supplying grain, oil-bearing crops, 
vegetables, and nonstaple food to downtown areas. Annual 
evaluations will be conducted, the results of which will serve 
as an important criterion in gauging leading cadres' 
performances.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 16 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
economic center of Shanghai is speeding up educational reform by 
cooperating with foreign institutions and individuals in running 
15 schools. 
  According to educators here, these schools are aimed at 
training talented people for Shanghai's modernization, and 
extending the friendship between local residents with overseas 
Chinese and foreign friends. 
  Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 
1949, 
Shanghai's foreign contacts in education had been limited in the 
exchanges of students, inter-school academic activities and 
overseas donations. 
  With the deepening of China's national reform and opening 
further to the outside world, many overseas institutions and 
individuals who were attracted by Shanghai's economic and social 
development wanted to cooperate with the city in running schools. 
  The 15 schools were selected from overseas applicants with 
an 
approval of the State Education Commission. 
  They are run jointly by the Chinese and institutions and 
individuals from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Britain, 
the United States, Germany and Japan. 
  Two of them are technical schools and the rest are junior, 
second and tertiary educational institutions, all of which are 
non-profit organizations. 
  To ensure the healthy development of these schools, the 
Shanghai Municipal Government issued a regulation on 
administration of cooperation in running schools by overseas 
institutions and individuals in Shanghai early this year to 
protect the legal rights of people in running the schools. 
  "To cooperate with overseas institutions and individuals in 
running schools may help us absorb overseas capital and use 
foreign experience for reference in running schools," said 
professor Wang Shenghong, director of the office of public 
health and education under the Shanghai Municipal Government and 
director of the municipal higher-learning education. 
  "It will also be beneficial to training talented people 
needed for Shanghai's modernization and protecting the 
patriotism of overseas Chinese and promoting friendship of 
foreign friends," he said, "and it will benefit Shanghai's 
education." 
  According to professor Wang, these schools are advanced in 
facilities and strict in administration and teaching, and their 
courses are in line with the needs of Shanghai's economic and 
social development. 
  One example is the Shanghai-British qualification 
examination 
committee for certified public accountants, a joint venture 
between the Shanghai Pudong Continuous Education Center with the 
British chartered Association of Certified Accountants. 
  Trainees from the committee have been welcomed and 
appreciated by enterprises. 
  Students at a business training institute, which is jointly 
run by the Shanghai Institute for Training Young Managerial 
Workers and a Hong Kong company, are using advanced computers 
and other equipment provided by the Hong Kong side. 
  Professor Wang noted that several higher-learning 
institutions in Shanghai are holding talks with overseas 
organizations on cooperation in setting up schools in the New 
Pudong Area to train more qualified people in industrial and 
commercial management. 
  The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone 
that 
is expected to lead the transformation of Shanghai's industrial 
and financial sectors.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has 
accelerated the pace in upgrading its cultural facilities, while 
its infrastructures such as highways, bridges and subways are 
becoming the focus of attention both at home and abroad. 
  This year, the city will pour 1.4 billion yuan into several 
important facilities, including the Shanghai Library, Shanghai 
Museum and a television station in the Pudong New Area. 
  From 1991 to 1995, Shanghai plans to inject more than four 
billion yuan into the field, compared with 536 million yuan in 
the 1986-1990 period. 
  According to its ambitious plan, this biggest city in China 
will boast a batch of advanced facilities involving theaters, 
cinemas, music halls, book stores and gymnasiums before the end 
of this century. The investment is estimated at about 10 
billion yuan. 
  Despite the allocation from local government, most of it is 
to be raised through various channels, like land leasing, stock 
issuance and other flexible measures to absorb domestic and 
foreign funds. 
  A top official of the municipality said that these 
facilities 
are important for improving the citizens' quality and building 
Shanghai into a first-class international city. 
  At present, the city with a population of 13 million has 
less 
than 5,000 entertainment spots, 66 cinemas and 31 libraries, far 
from enough to meet the inhabitants' urgent demands resulting 
from rapid economic growth.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Li Zemin, Wan Xueyuan Emphasize at </F>
the Second (Enlarged) Session of the Provincial Discipline 
Inspection Commission: Party Committees and Governments at 
Various Levels Should Earnestly Strengthen Leadership To Unfold 
Unremittingly the Anticorruption Struggle"] 
  [Text] Addressing the second (enlarged) session of the 
provincial Discipline Inspection Commission on 1 April, 
provincial party committee Secretary Li Zemin emphasized: Party 
committees and governments at various levels must take the 
entire work of the party as a whole, proceed from the level 
where we can strengthen the flesh-blood party-people ties and 
consolidate the party's ruling status in fulfilling its 
important historic mission of promoting reform, opening up, and 
the socialist modernization drive; and unremittingly carry on 
with the anticorruption struggle with periodic results by 
further unifying thinking and understanding, summing up 
experiences, keeping a sober mind, and enhancing a sense of 
responsibility and urgency. 
  Li Zemin said: Starting last year, particularly after the 
second plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, Zhejiang has been active in launching the 
anticorruption drive and building the party work style and clean 
government in accordance with the central commission's 
arrangements and demands. With importance being attached by 
party committees and governments at various levels, with large 
amount of arduous work being carried out by discipline 
inspection, supervisory, and judicial organs; with active 
participation from the vast number of cadres and the masses, and 
with common efforts by all concerned, we have been able to 
achieve certain results in our threefold anticorruption mission. 
Honesty and self-discipline awareness among leading cadres has 
been enhanced through self-screening against the "five 
stipulations." New headway was made in probing important cases 
following the stepping up of case investigations, marked results 
were achieved by the special units in rectifying unhealthy 
practices, and certain negative corrupt phenomena bitterly hated 
by the masses were checked to varying degrees. However, we must 
be sober enough to note that the anticorruption struggle has not 
been developing in a well- balanced manner and that the results 
achieved thus far have yet to be consolidated. Due to social, 
historical, economic, and ideological backgrounds, eliminating 
soils and conditions that breed negatives and decadence will not 
be possible within a substantially long period, particularly at 
the present time when the old systems are being replaced with 
the new ones amid inadequate laws and regulations. Because the 
anticorruption struggle is a long-term mission in the process of 
reform and opening up, it must be carried on unremittingly. 
  Li Zemin pointed out: The success of this year's 
anticorruption tasks will depend in a crucial way on their 
actual implementation by party committees, governments, and 
leading cadres at various levels with enhanced understanding and 
greater determination. Strengthening the anticorruption struggle 
is not only an internal demand in line with the party's basic 
line and in implementing the entire party work set by the 
central authorities this year, an important political guarantee 
in deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and 
promoting development, but it is also an important condition in 
maintaining political, social, and economic stability. Leaders 
at various levels must enhance their understanding of the 
anticorruption struggle, correctly master the dialectical 
relations of "fostering both material progress and cultural and 
ideological progress," and strengthen the sense of 
responsibility and urgency by overcoming such sentiments as 
slackness, fear of difficulty, weariness, and the anxiety about 
lagging behind when a comparison is made. The fight against 
corruption should be conducted in an in-depth, sustained, and 
solid manner. Tasks that were not completed last year as 
scheduled should be followed up while unsatisfactorily completed 
items need further remedial action. The "five new stipulations" 
put forward by the central authorities this year must be firmly 
implemented one by one in consideration of Zhejiang's reality. 
Besides, all localities and departments should seriously 
rectify relatively prominent negative corrupt phenomena commonly 
noted by the masses. We should intensify investigations to 
thoroughly find out what is actually going on, conscientiously 
study the limits of various policies before offering concrete 
opinions, and form special units to solve problems one after 
another. Both permanent solutions and temporary relief measures 
are required in fighting corruption. While curbing unhealthy 
tendencies and tightening up discipline, we should strengthen 
members' and cadres' immunity against decadent thinking by 
giving them more education on ideals and objectives and by 
enhancing their concept of party spirit. We should identify the 
key aspects and weak links of a system which are corruption 
prone and have them perfected and well managed. Organizations, 
the masses, public opinion, and democratic parties should 
intensify their supervisory roles, help improve laws and 
regulations, and thus gradually bring about a sound supervisory 
system. 
  Li Zemin stressed: Party committees at all levels must 
regard it as their bounden duty to effectively strengthen 
leadership over the anticorruption struggle; they must never 
regard it as a job of the discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs. First, they should make the anticorruption struggle an 
important item on their agenda, frequently analyze the state of 
the struggle, make suggestions and arrangements for 
anticorruption work for a period of time, and promptly study 
major problems in this work. The principal party and government 
leaders should personally attend to major cases in order to 
eliminate interference. They should insist on a thorough 
investigation and never be indulgent toward wrongdoing. Second, 
it is necessary to strengthen supervision, study the situation, 
promptly discover and solve problems, and sum up and spread 
experiences so as to use them to guide the anticorruption drive 
as a whole. Third, efforts should be made to improve the 
responsibility system by which leading cadres are responsible 
for promoting party work style and honesty. Leading organs of a 
higher level should oversee the work of those of a lower level, 
and leading organs of a lower level should be responsible to 
those of a higher level. The fight against corruption, the 
improvement of party work style, and the building of a clean 
government should be made important criteria for evaluating the 
performance of a locality and cadres. These criteria should 
also be integrated with the training, education, and appointment 
of cadres. Fourth, we should continue to uphold the system of 
holding joint anticorruption meetings and support 
law-enforcement departments, such as discipline inspection, 
supervisory, and procuratorial organs, to exercise their 
functions. These organs should improve their effectiveness 
through coordination. Fifth, we should show concern for the 
training of discipline inspection and supervisory personnel. We 
should create good conditions for the allocation, exchange, and 
training of cadres. We should protect discipline inspection and 
supervisory cadres who uphold principles and carry out their 
functions boldly. Whenever cases of retaliation against 
discipline inspection and supervisory cadres are discovered, 
they must be investigated and handled strictly. We should do 
our best to help discipline inspection and supervisory cadres 
solve problems relating to work and living conditions. 
  Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of Zhejiang, also spoke at the meeting. 
He said: Governments at all levels should keep the overall 
situation of this year's work in mind, adhere to the principle 
of "grasping two links," make overall plans and take all factors 
into consideration, and integrate the anticorruption struggle 
with deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, 
expanding development, and maintaining stability. First, 
leading cadres should set an example in being honest and in 
doing their jobs industriously. They should be honest and 
discipline themselves according to the two "five-point 
regulations." At the same time, they should pay attention to 
the anticorruption struggle in their localities and departments. 
The principal leaders should assume personal command over the 
struggle and personally solve major problems. In the future, 
when leading cadres are evaluated, they will be checked to see 
whether they perform their duties industriously and whether the 
units under their leadership are honest and clean. Second, we 
should solid work. We should attend to economic work and 
opening to the outside world in a down-to-earth banner. 
Likewise, we should do solid work when we strive to build a 
clean government and combat corruption. Third, we should 
support discipline inspection and supervisory organs to carry 
out their functions in order to concentrate strength in 
combating corruption. The leading cadres of governments and 
departments at all levels must attach importance to and show 
concern for discipline inspection and supervisory cadres, trust 
them politically, support them in their work, and help them with 
their living conditions. In this way, discipline inspection and 
supervisory cadres will work without worries and will be devoted 
to their duties. Wan Xueyuan stressed: Economic and 
administrative departments need the support of discipline 
inspection and supervisory departments, and the discipline 
inspection and supervisory departments also need the support of 
economic and administrative departments. Therefore, they should 
support one another and closely coordinate with one another to 
make greater contributions to the efforts of deepening reform, 
opening Zhejiang wider to the outside world, bringing about the 
sustained, rapid, and sound development of its economy, and 
promoting a good party work style and honesty. 
  The second plenary session (enlarged) of the provincial 
discipline inspection commission ended on 1 April. At the 
session, 18 units introduced their experiences in combating 
corruption and promoting the improvement of party work style and 
honesty. The session examined and adopted the work report given 
by Wang Qichao on behalf of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission's standing committee.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 16 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province is boosting its telecommunications to meet the needs of 
its rapid economic growth. 
  At present, the province has advanced program-controlled 
telephone exchanges with a combined capacity of 1.6 million 
lines, double the figure for 1992. 
  It has laid a 2,790-km optical-fiber communications cable, 
adding 18,000 lines to its province's telecommunications 
capacity. 
  An official of the provincial posts and telecommunications 
bureau said that program-controlled telephone exchanges and 
mobile phone services cover every county in the province. 
  So far, there are 12.84 telephones for every 100 people in 
urban areas and 1.42 for every 100 people in the countryside. 
  According to the official, the province plans to open 
additional program-controlled telephone exchanges handling one 
million lines this year.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 16 (CNS) -- Guangzhou decided to 
thoroughly change the management mechanism for state-owned 
enterprises by means of transformation of the property rights 
and attraction of foreign investment. A total of 50 enterprises 
which were suffering from a great loss were recently chosen for 
a trial practice for the restructuring. A two-year period is 
also set for the handling of property rights for a great number 
of enterprises. 
  State-owned enterprises in Guangzhou saw each item suffer 
from a loss of RMB 3 billion. [sentence as received] The 
number of industrial enterprises which registered a loss within 
the budget was nearly 36 percent of the total last year which 
was far beyond the government expectation. 
  The measures for a solution to the loss made by state-owned 
enterprises will be centred on the transfer of shares of the 
large enterprises or group and in introduction of foreign 
capital, technology, the market and management. Enterprises in 
the red which are situated in prime sections in particular will 
make way for the development of real estate. Proceeds resulting 
from the real estate will be used to pay debt owed by those 
enterprises. The municipal government has asked foreign trade 
department for helping these enterprises to bring in foreign 
capital for exploitation of the real estate. 
  Guangzhou will also make great effort in re-organizing the 
capital pattern of state-owned enterprises for diversification 
of investment and for popularity of the property rights. 
Involvement of foreign investment in the shareholding practice, 
employment of the shareholding system in enterprises and auction 
carried out for enterprises in serious loss are all aimed at 
making enterprises meet the market economy while at the same 
time the unlimited liability for enterprises held by the state 
had also to be changed. Enterprises were generally shifted into 
limited liability companies, a move to make enterprises have 
civil liability for the management of their property.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Guangdong, one of 
China's most developed provinces, will hold talks with Italy in 
Milan on bilateral trade and economic cooperation starting from 
May 17. 
  The 80-member Guangdong delegation to the talks will be 
headed by Liu Weiming, vice-governor of the province. They will 
bring with them a list of 80 of Guangdong's projects seeking 
overseas investment and technological cooperation and a list of 
commodities the province wishes to import and export. 
  The talks were sponsored by the Italian newspaper entitled 
SOLE 24 ORE (The Sun of 24 Hours), the Italian Institute for 
Foreign Trade, the Italian Association of Industrial 
Manufacturers, and the Milan Federation of Chambers of Commerce. 
  According to an official from the Guangdong Provincial 
Government, the talks are aimed at increasing the mutual 
understanding between Guangdong and Italy and promoting 
cooperation and exchange in trade and economic cooperation 
between the two sides. 
  Last year, only 0.68 percent of Guangdong's imports last 
year 
worth 19.9 billion U.S. dollars was from Italy and 0.26 percent 
of the province's exports worth 27 billion U.S. dollars went to 
Italy. Among the 44,700 approved overseas-funded enterprises in 
Guangdong by the end of last year, only 14 were funded by Italy.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 16 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province, an economically developed area in the 
country, still has about one million poor people in the 
mountainous areas and is now accelerating its pace of helping 
these people to eliminate poverty. 
  Guangdong has 50 mountainous counties, with an accumulated 
territory of 116,000 sq km and a combined population of 26.5 
million people, respectively making up 65 and 42 percent of the 
total of the province. Most of the 14 million poor peasants 
lived in these counties. 
  Thanks to the local government's poverty-relief efforts, 
from 
1985 to 1993 the population living under the poverty line was 
reduced from 14 million to one million while the total annual 
financial revenue of these counties has increased from 450 
million yuan to 2.3 billion yuan, and the average income per 
capita has increased from 418 yuan to 1,250 yuan. 
  However, as the coastal areas of the province have developed 
remarkably since the country implemented the reform and opening 
policies ten years ago, the gap has been widened between the 
poor areas and the developed areas. 
  Ou Guangyuan, deputy governor of the province, said that 
although some areas have become well off through tremendous 
efforts, more than 30 counties are still backward. 
  He said that poverty-relief work in the province started in 
1985. The provincial government and departments have all worked 
out favorable policies to support the mountainous counties. 
  As most of the poor people live in the mountainous areas, 
the 
local government has encouraged and supported them to plant 
trees to improve the ecological environment. 
  By 1992, forest-covered areas had increased to 51.5 percent 
of the total territory of the province, compared with 22.7 
percent in 1985. Erosion-prone areas of 1.33 million hectares 
were also brought under control. 
  Meanwhile, the peasants in the mountainous areas are 
encouraged to plant fruit trees and vegetables. 
  The local government also is helping peasants to set up 
enterprises which can make use of mountain resources, such as 
hydropower stations, building materials, minerals and forest 
products. 
  As the Pearl River delta in the province is one of the 
richest areas of China, the province has called upon it to 
assist the poor mountainous areas, helping them to establish 
sister relationships. 
  The rich area assists the poor through four ways: first, it 
allocates funds for infrastructural construction in the poor 
area; second, it helps establish enterprises which can make use 
of the laborers in the poor area and bring in income; third, it 
helps the poor area to improve agricultural efficiency by 
spreading new technologies; fourth, it also helps to build 
welfare and public facilities in the poor areas. 
  In the past few years, the rich coastal areas have poured 
nearly 500 million yuan into the poor areas and completed more 
than 300 projects in the areas. 
  The province has also sent officials and technicians to the 
poor counties to help these counties shake off poverty. 
  In 1993 alone, the provincial government sent 220 officials 
to 30 poor counties. These officials and technicians are 
welcome because they helped the locals to set up more than 200 
projects and trained many technicians. 
  The poorest area of the province is located in its northern 
part, where the ground is covered with limestone and the natural 
conditions are adverse and even unsuitable for human life. Half 
of the poor peasants who have not enough clothes and food lived 
in this area in 1993. 
  Since 1985, the province has been relocating the area's 
residents in the suburbs of the cities. The provincial 
government has fashioned a program to move 100,000 people from 
the limestone area in the coming two years. 
  Ou Guangyuan said that the province will help all the poor 
people shake off poverty in two years.

  [Text] Nanning, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Ethnic minorities in 
China's southern and southwestern provinces who once often 
fought over agriculture resources are now working together to 
get rich. 
  About two dozen of China's 55 ethnic minorities live in 
remote mountain villages in provincial borders between Guangxi, 
Guangdong, Hunan, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces, like the Zhuang, 
Yao, Miao, Dong, Buyi, Shuijia, Maonan, Mulam and Yi. 
  With China becoming market-oriented, these neighboring 
ethnic 
people have been convinced that they should work together to 
lift themselves from poverty instead of wrangling with each 
other over ownership of land, water conservancy and forests. 
  Encouraged by governments at various levels, ethnic 
autonomous prefectures in these provinces have formed economic 
cooperation councils to coordinate economic development. 
  As the neighboring ethnic prefectures belong to different 
provinces, local highways often did not connect in the past. 
Since 1985, however, 35 such roads have been built to connect 
the bordering areas and 45 scheduled passenger and cargo bus 
routes between different minority areas added. 
  Meanwhile, some 180 markets have been established in 17 
neighboring counties. 
  The effort has brought prosperity for the ethnic villages as 
over 30,000 local ethnic people have turned to business in 
provincial borders in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region alone. 
  In the face of rapid economic growth, their cooperation has 
now expanded from agricultural production, to industry, science 
and technology, commerce, transportation and material supply.

<F P=106> [Hainan Provincial Government Work report delivered by </F>
Hainan Governor Ruan Chongwu (7086 1504 2976) before the Second 
Session of the First Provincial People's Congress on 1 March: 
"Government Work Report"] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies: 
  On behalf of the Hainan Provincial People's Government, I 
hereby present the Government Work Report to the congress for 
your consideration. It is also requested that all Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference members and other 
persons attending as nonvoting delegates offer their opinions. 
<H5>  I. A Review of Work in 1993 </H5>
  Over the last year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we have seriously implemented the spirit of the 
14th party congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee, and led the people of all nationalities 
throughout the province in tightly centering on the goal of 
building a socialist market economy structure and achieving 
modernization. This was for the purpose of deepening reform and 
expanding opening up, so that the national economy and the 
various social undertakings would see sustained, rapid and 
healthy development, and so as to lay down a firm base on which 
the Hainan Special Economic Zone could move to a higher stage. 
  --The major national economic indices continued to see rapid 
growth. The GDP totaled 20.4 billion yuan, up 22.8 percent as 
compared with the previous year. Of the total, primary industry 
added value [zeng jia zhi 1073 0502 0237] was 7.55 billion yuan, 
a growth of 10.5 percent; secondary industry added value was 6.2 
billion yuan, a growth of 51.6 percent; and tertiary industry 
added value was 6.7 billion yuan, an increase of 15.3 percent. 
The speed of growth of these economic indices in each case 
exceeded the requirements of the annual plan and of the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan, and was higher than the average level of growth 
over the years since the establishment of the province. 
  --There was new development in agricultural production, and 
great progress was achieved in structural readjustment. The 
gross output value of agriculture was 8.86 billion yuan, up 11.3 
percent on the previous year. This continued the double-digit 
growth which had been maintained for two years. Good results 
were realized in eco- agriculture, tourist agriculture and 
township and town enterprises. While grain and sugar-cane saw 
declines in output volume as a result of dry weather, output of 
fruit, vegetables, meat and aquatic products all grew by over 20 
percent. The gross output value of township and town 
enterprises totaled 4.57 billion yuan, up 84.3 percent on the 
previous year. Forestry production completed the tasks for the 
year. Even in this dry year, five cities and counties--Danzhou, 
Lingao, Tunchang, Chengmai and Qionghai--all saw increased 
production of grain. 
  --The speed and benefits of industrial production grew in 
tandem, and the development of communications, transport and 
posts and telecommunications was accelerated. Gross industrial 
output value reached 10 billion yuan, up 38.9 percent over the 
previous year. Added industrial value totaled 2.8 billion yuan, 
a growth of 36.2 percent. For the first time, gross industrial 
output value exceeded gross agricultural output value. 
Industrial production and sales both prospered and economic 
benefits continued to improve. Transport and the posts and 
telecommunications industries achieved added value amounting to 
1.26 billion yuan, a 26.7 percent increase over the previous 
year. All cities and counties throughout the province were 
connected to long-distance direct-dialing telephone facilities, 
while the average number of telephones installed has now 
exceeded the national average figure. In Haikou City, there are 
27.9 telephones per 100 persons, the highest figure for any 
provincial capital in China. 
  --Fixed-asset investment increased and the best achievements 
ever were realized in construction. Total social fixed-asset 
investment was 16.94 billion yuan (not including the Yangpu 
Development Zone), an increase of 94.6 percent over the previous 
year. The investment structure was further improved and the 
amount of investment in basic facilities and basic industries 
rose from 2.4 billion yuan in 1992 to 3.5 billion yuan. The 
intensity of key construction investment and the rate of 
construction progress both saw the best figures since the 
establishment of the province. 
  --Obvious results were achieved in the drawing in of foreign 
funds, forming links with domestic enterprises, and attracting 
businesses and capital. The year 1993 was Hainan's 
International Business Attraction Year and, over the year, 15 
large-scale activities for attracting foreign businesses were 
arranged, while opening up to the outside continued to be 
expanded. Over the year, 3,106 contracts involving the use of 
foreign funds were signed, and the amount of investment involved 
in the contracts was $6.4 billion, an increase of 81.1 percent 
as compared with the previous year. The amount of foreign funds 
actually used was $970 million, an increase of 82.7 percent over 
the previous year. Foreign exchange receipts from tourism 
totaled $350 million (in foreign exchange certificates), an 
increase of 13.2 percent over the previous year. The total value 
of commodities exported in foreign trade was $900 million, a 
growth of 2.3 percent, while the total value of imports coming 
through the ports was $167 million, an increase of 105 percent. 
  --Fiscal income saw a great increase while, through 
macroeconomic regulation and control, the financial situation 
moved toward stability. Local fiscal income totaled 2.91 
billion yuan, up 94.5 percent on the previous year. Fiscal 
expenditure was 3.85 billion yuan, up 51.9 percent. The 
percentage growth in fiscal income was the highest figure ever. 
The balance of deposits in financial organs throughout the 
province at the end of the year (not including foreign-funded 
banks) was 43.3 billion yuan, up 24.8 percent. The credit 
outstanding at the end of the year totaled 37.1 billion yuan, a 
growth of 37.5 percent on the figure at the beginning of the 
year. Of these two figures, the balance of deposits in state 
banks was 3.4 billion yuan, 23.2 percent up on the figure at the 
beginning of the year, while the outstanding credit from these 
banks totaled 30 billion yuan, up 43 percent on the figure at 
the beginning of the year. The savings deposits of urban and 
rural residents at the end of the year was 18.4 billion yuan, 
63.2 percent up on the figure at the beginning of the year. 
  --Urban and rural markets have been vigorous and the 
people's 
standard of living has been continuously improved. Markets have 
prospered throughout the province, with both purchases and sales 
being good. The total volume of retail sales throughout society 
reached 7.74 billion yuan, up 32.6 percent on the previous year. 
Supply-demand relationships were relatively stable. The average 
increase in the level of retail prices throughout society was 
23.9 percent. The per-capita living expenditure of urban 
residents was 2,774 yuan, up 32.5 percent. The average 
per-capita net income of peasants was 1,016 yuan, a growth of 
13.9 percent. 
  --The various social undertakings, including science and 
technology, education, sport and health, all saw thriving 
development. Throughout the province, 17 national-level "torch" 
programs, "spark" programs and local problem-smashing programs 
were approved and established. Another 35 projects won 
scientific and technological achievement awards at the 
provincial level or above. There were new advances in new 
product development, in technology market development and in the 
training of skilled technological personnel, and the pace at 
which scientific and technological achievements were turned into 
commodities and industrial products was accelerated. Investment 
in education was increased and educational conditions were 
continually improved. The funds put into education throughout 
the province grew by 31.2 percent over the previous year. Basic 
education was consolidated and developed, and the rate of 
school-age children entering school and the consolidation rate 
[gong gu lu 2255 0942 3764] were both raised. There was further 
development in tertiary education, adult education and 
vocational and technical education. The total number of 
students in schools at all levels and of all types was about 
1.38 million, which represents a higher proportion of the total 
provincial population than is the case for the national average. 
A thriving situation was seen in the cultural and arts spheres, 
and we successively built or expanded a number of cultural 
halls, libraries and cinemas. The "round-island cultural 
corridor" activities were carried out smoothly and obvious 
achievements were realized in television, news, publishing and 
literature and art creation. Big strides were made in sports 
undertakings, and in 1993 for the first time our provincial team 
participated in the national games. We also participated in 25 
national competitions for various sports and events. In this we 
realized fine results. Mass sports activities were also widely 
developed. Medical and health facilities were gradually 
improved, and there was continual improvement in the levels of 
prevention and cure. Over the year, 23.41 million yuan was 
invested in 77 projects to build and expand township and town 
hospitals, public health centers and epidemic prevention 
stations. The incidence of infectious diseases was down 10.7 
percent as compared with the previous year. The planned 
parenthood target responsibility system completion rates were 
quite good. Calculated on the basis of a permanent population 
at the end of last year of 7.012 million persons, the natural 
rate of population increase was 15.55 per thousand. Work in 
foreign affairs, overseas Chinese affairs, nationality affairs, 
religious affairs, the work of supporting the Army and giving 
preferential treatment to the families of heroes and martyrs, 
militia work, the building of reserve service contingents, as 
well as work in comprehensive improvement of social order, 
opposing corruption and promoting the building of clean 
government all achieved good results. 
  In looking back at the work in 1993, it can be seen that we 
placed stress on grasping the following several aspects: 
  1. Increasing the strength of the reforms, and 
accelerating the building of a socialist market economy 
structure. 
  From the beginning of last year, we accelerated the pace at 
which we engaged in building a socialist market economy 
structure, and successively instituted a series of major reform 
measures. First, in accordance with the principle of relaxing 
examination and strengthening management, we promulgated and 
implemented the "Regulations on Registration and Management of 
Enterprise Corporate Bodies in Hainan Province," which changed 
the process of applying to establish an enterprise from a system 
of registration following examination and approval to a system 
of direct registration. This reform simplified the application 
procedures, relaxed the operational scope and, on the systems 
level, blocked the loopholes which gave rise to improper 
practices, while promoting the building of clean government. 
Second, Haikou City took the lead in reforming the tax levying 
and management regulations. The system of specialized tax 
personnel being assigned to specific tax accounts was abolished 
and they initially established a new tax levying and management 
system whereby taxpayers take the initiative to report their 
tax, where intermediate organs act as agents in the payment of 
tax, where computer systems assess tax in accordance with the 
regulations and where judicial organs handle cases in accordance 
with the law. In deepening reform of the tax levying and 
management system, beneficial experiments were carried out. 
Third, great efforts were put into promoting the shareholding 
system. Throughout the province, permission was given to newly 
establish 75 limited shareholding companies. Of these, the 
shareholding companies involved in communications and energy 
construction raised large amounts of funds, thereby guaranteeing 
the needs of key basic facility construction and the development 
of basic industries. 
  Experimental work was begun on 
developing mutual shareholdings among enterprise corporate 
entities, and this played a positive role in perfecting the 
property rights transfer system and promoting the optimized 
deployment of production factors. Fourth, the transformation of 
enterprise operational mechanisms was accelerated. We abolished 
a number of management departments for industrial and 
communications enterprises and implemented manager (director) 
responsibility systems under the leadership of boards of 
directors. In respect of the managers (directors) of some of 
the enterprises under the provincial commercial and trade 
system, open recruitment was implemented. The organizational 
construction of the Hainan Chamber of Commerce was strengthened. 
This created conditions for strengthening enterprise links, 
safeguarding enterprise interests and increasing enterprise 
self-discipline. Fifth, reforms were implemented to promote and 
improve the social security system, to expand the coverage of 
social security, and to strengthen the collection and management 
of social security funds. Sixth, the urban housing system 
reforms have already been instituted in organs directly under 
the province and in some cities and counties. 
  Legislative work has been strengthened, and reform and 
legislation have been organically combined. Last year, on the 
basis of an overall clearing up, in the light of Hainan's 
realities, we promulgated 25 laws and regulations related to the 
building of a socialist market economy structure. We also 
strengthened supervision and inspection work in respect of law 
enforcement and carried out specific inspections of law 
enforcement situations in terms of reducing the burden on the 
peasants, environmental protection, and health. That is, we 
ensured that the laws and regulations were being implemented and 
also strengthened the concept of handling matters in accordance 
with the law. 
  2. Firmly grasping basic industries, accelerating 
construction of basic facilities. 
  Firmly upholding the goal of increasing peasants' income and 
taking the market as guidance, we put great efforts into 
readjusting the rural industrial structure, into strengthening 
the building of basic agricultural facilities, into strongly 
developing the "two highs and one excellent" agriculture and 
township and town industries, and into promoting the overall 
development of the rural economy. Last year, we convened two 
provincial agricultural work conferences and, on the basis of 
summing up work and spreading experiences, we further 
strengthened the basic status of agriculture and strengthened 
guidance of agricultural work. In a situation which saw a 
serious dry spell, we actively organized all sides to 
participate in drought-relief activities, so as to reduce the 
harm to grain production. Last year, there were great increases 
in agricultural credit funds and in agricultural-support fiscal 
expenditure, and grain and sugar-cane purchase funds were 
basically able to meet demand in a timely way. In order to 
truly reduce the burden on the peasants, throughout the province 
we sorted out the situation in respect of "the issuing of white 
slips" and formulated "Various Regulations on Earnestly Reducing 
the Burden on the Peasants," so as to safeguard the production 
enthusiasm of the peasants. It is particularly worth pointing 
out that last year, through the wide-ranging attracting of 
businesses and drawing in of funds, township and town 
enterprises and the comprehensive development of agriculture 
both saw very great advances. 
  In order to speed the pace of construction of basic 
facilities, we carried out reform of the investment structure 
and the management structure, and reorganized basic facility 
project ownership through standardized shareholding systems. 
Preferential comprehensive compensation policies were 
implemented, so as to encourage all spheres of society to invest 
in key projects in order to greatly speed the construction of 
basic energy, communications and telecommunications facilities. 
The first 60,000-kw generating set at Daguangba [1129 0342 
1056] hydroelectric station is already generating electricity 
and has been connected to the electricity grid, while a further 
148 km of 220-kilovolt transmission line has been added. A 
further 129 km of high-speed highway has been added and the 
handling capacity of the ports is now 800,000 tonnes. 
Program-controlled telephone switching systems with a capacity 
of 105,000 lines were newly added, and an additional 4,320 
long-distance telephone lines were installed. The Nanshan power 
station began generating electricity in the first half of this 
year and it is guaranteed that the Fenghuang Airport at Sanya 
will open in July this year. The Meilan [5019 5695] airport 
project has already received the approval of the State Council 
and the Central Military Commission. A vibrant situation has 
been seen in the building of basic energy, communications and 
telecommunications facilities throughout the province. 
  3. Expanding opening up to the outside world, 
attracting businesses and drawing in funds. 
  Taking the development of economic and trade activities as 
the center, we successively held major celebratory activities to 
commemorate the fifth anniversary of the establishment of Hainan 
Province and Special Economic Zone, the Second International 
Coconut Festival, a maritime communications conference, and the 
Third Alliance and Friendship Conference for Hainan Hometown 
Associations Throughout the World. We also organized and held 
Hainan Introduction Conferences in Hong Kong and other places, 
where we introduced to people from China and abroad a number of 
projects for attracting businesses and drawing in capital. The 
drawing in of foreign businesses and the arranging of domestic 
links realized pleasing results. The development of the Haikou 
Bonded Zone and the Yangpu Economic Development Zone was 
smoothly completed. There was new progress in the construction 
of the Yalongwan tourism and holiday area. Following approval by 
the state, the Yangpu and Basuo border trade points were 
established and developed. 
  The reform of the foreign trade 
structure was further deepened, foreign trade export policies 
were relaxed, open tenders were called for for some export 
commodity quotas, and the mechanism of competition was drawn in 
so as to promote the development of foreign trade. Last year, 
in a planned way, our province sent delegations to visit the 
various countries of Southeast Asia, and we received visits from 
distinguished guests including Prime Minister Mahathir of 
Malaysia, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand, Singapore's 
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, President Cheddi Jagan of Guyana, 
and President Brazauskas of Lithuania. These visits promoted 
Hainan's external economic and cultural cooperation and 
interchange. 
  4. Rectifying financial order, strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  Our province has seriously implemented the series of major 
decisions by the central authorities on strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and has formulated and 
implemented the 12 measures on "Strengthening Macroeconomic 
Regulation and Control, Deepening Financial Reform and Doing 
Well in Current Financial Work." We organized 22 work groups to 
go to all financial organs throughout the province to 
investigate the situation in respect of inter-borrowing of 
funds, and to stop that inter-borrowing which violated the 
regulations. Grasping the opportunity afforded by the two 
national readjustments of interest rates, deposits were actively 
sought, and bank savings deposits gradually revived. 
Account-settling management was strengthened so as to guarantee 
normal payments. Financial order thus saw a marked turn for the 
better and the financial situation moved toward stability. 
After May last year, there was a landslide in enterprise 
deposits. Banks then readjusted the credit structure so that 
credit funds were slanted toward key projects and basic 
industries. The investment in "two highs and one excellent" 
agriculture and other high-efficiency industries was increased, 
so as to guarantee, on the funds level, the speedy development 
of the economy. 
  In order to further standardize the real estate market, the 
provincial government formulated the "Ideas on Strengthening 
Macroeconomic Management of the Real Estate Market." All cities 
and counties carried out an overall clean-up and readjustment of 
real estate companies and development zones, canceled 88 
development zones which had not been examined and approved by 
the State Council and the provincial government, and recovered 
some land which had passed the period approved and still not 
been put to use. Great attention was paid to drawing up a 
comprehensive provincial program for state land use and overall 
programs for land use in the cities and counties, and the "five 
unifieds" development model was actively promoted. Supervision 
over the implementation of the "Land Management Law" was 
strengthened, so as to guarantee the smooth carrying out of 
development and construction. 
  We rectified economic order, seriously implemented the 
"Product Quality Law" and powerfully struck at illegal 
activities of producing and selling fake and low-grade 
commodities in order to safeguard the rights and interests of 
consumers. In accordance with the principle of striking in a 
focused way and achieving comprehensive improvement, throughout 
the province we adopted joint actions to strike at smugglers and 
criminals, in order to stabilize the economic situation. 
<H5>  5. Strengthening social order and launching the </H5>
anticorruption struggle, in order to coordinate the development 
of the various social undertakings. 
  Since the beginning of last year, we have put great efforts 
into strengthening widespread education in the legal system, and 
we have seriously implemented the various tasks of the "5 
February [er wu 0059 0063]" law popularization. We have firmly 
upheld the policy of "concurrently striking and stressing 
prevention, treating both the symptoms and the cause, but 
placing stress on treating the cause," established the system of 
patrolling policemen, organized joint defence against criminals 
by the Army, the police and the people, and firmly struck at all 
sorts of criminal activities. At the same time, the various 
measures for comprehensively improving social order were further 
implemented. In developing the struggle against corruption, we 
have earnestly examined and handled some cases of illegal 
actions, punished the corrupt elements, rooted out corrupt 
phenomena, promoted the building of clean government in 
government organs and further improved the investment 
environment. 
  We seriously implemented the principle of "using science and 
technology to invigorate Hainan," accelerated the construction 
of science and technology demonstration areas, firmly 
implemented the "torch," "spark" and "problem-smashing" 
programs, and successfully hosted the 1993 Chinese New Science 
and Technology, Patented Technology and Patented Products 
Exhibition, which promoted the development, propagation and 
application of scientific and technological achievements. 
  We conscientiously implemented the "Program for the Reform 
and Development of China's Education," strengthened various 
aspects of educational reform, positively implemented plans for 
nine years mandatory education, strongly promoted vocational and 
technical education, readjusted the structure of tertiary 
education, and in coordination with the implementation of the 
"prairie fire" program, strengthened peasants cultural education 
and vocational and technical education. "Project Hope" 
activities were developed throughout the province and marked 
results were achieved. The cultural market was reorganized so 
as to eliminate ugly social phenomena and so as to promote the 
healthy development of cultural undertakings. 
  With the control of the spread of infectious diseases as the 
center, we strengthened preventative and health protection work. 
We were firm in the enforcement of health laws, supervision and 
management of medicines was strengthened, we struck firmly at 
those who manufactured and sold fake or poor quality medicines 
or engaged in other criminal activities, and we reorganized the 
medical and health market. 
  With villages as the focal point 
and using tubal ligations in families with two daughters as the 
central point, we tightly grasped the implementation of the 
population and family planning target responsibility systems, in 
order to realize the annual population plans. 
  Fellow Deputies! Over the last year, under the leadership of 
the party Central Committee, the State Council and the Hainan 
Provincial CPC Committee, the people of all nationalities 
throughout the province have united in struggle, developed and 
pushed forward and quite satisfactorily completed the various 
tasks for 1993 set down by the First Session of the First 
Provincial People's Congress. On behalf of the provincial 
people's government, I would like to express heartfelt thanks to 
the people of all nationalities throughout the province for 
their trust in and support of the government's work! I would 
also like to express sincere thanks to the People's Liberation 
Army forces stationed in Hainan, to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan 
compatriots, to overseas Chinese and to friends from all circles 
who have concerned themselves with and supported the 
modernization of Hainan! 
  In 1993, our province's national economy and the various 
social undertakings all saw strong development. However, we 
must also soberly realize that there are still some deficiencies 
and problems in government work, and that many difficulties and 
problems continue to exist in development. Basic industries and 
basic facilities still do not accord with the needs of the 
national economy and social development, and the restrictions of 
these bottlenecks are still very prominent. The task of 
building basic facilities is onerous and there is a great lack 
of funds. The agricultural base is weak, and the capacity to 
withstand natural disasters is quite poor. The province still 
has 100,000 people who have not yet escaped poverty, and the 
tasks associated with poverty alleviation are still arduous. 
The scale of industry is too small, and some products are 
lacking in competitiveness. Growth in exports has been slow and 
a relatively stable export commodity production base has not yet 
been formed. Prices have seen quite large increases. In some 
areas the social order situation is not good, and among a small 
number of government personnel there still exist phenomena such 
as bureaucratism and corruption. We must give great attention 
to these problems, so that they can be earnestly dealt with and 
resolved. 
<H5>  II. The Targets and Tasks for 1994 </H5>
<H5>  I. Development targets </H5>
  Seen from the national situation, the overall national 
economy has continued to move in a direction of speedy and 
healthy development, the domestic market potential is very 
great, and around the world there are optimistic opinions of 
China's future prospects. These all provide us with a rare 
opportunity. The CPC Central Committee has strongly pointed out 
that grasping the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development and promoting stability are 
work for the whole party and the whole country. We must, in 
every aspect of work, recognize this overall situation, 
subordinate ourselves to and serve this situation, and seriously 
handle well the relationships among reform, development and 
stability. Thus, the overall guiding ideology in our province's 
economic and social development is: Taking Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the basic line of the party as guidance, we 
will in an overall way implement the spirit of the 14th party 
congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, speed up the pace of construction of a socialist 
market economy structure, stabilize and enrich Hainan's 
preferential policies, further expand opening up to the outside, 
put great efforts into readjusting the economic structure, 
strive to raise economic results, and maintain the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. At the 
same time, we will firmly grasp the building of spiritual 
construction, safeguard social stability, coordinate the 
development of the various social undertakings and promote 
Hainan's modernization in an overall way. 
  In accordance with this guiding ideology, our province has 
set down that the targets for the national economy and social 
development this year will include: A GDP of 27 billion yuan, a 
growth of 18 percent on last year. Of this, tertiary industry 
will grow 23 percent. Gross agricultural output value of 9.74 
billion yuan, a growth of 10 percent. Agricultural added value 
of 8.5 billion yuan, an increase of 7 percent. Gross industrial 
output value of 13.03 billion yuan, an increase of 30 percent. 
Industrial added value of 3.8 billion yuan, an increase of 28 
percent. Total social fixed-assets investment of 20 billion 
yuan, an increase of 18 percent. Actual utilization of foreign 
funds amounting to $1.1 billion, an increase of 13.2 percent. 
Local fiscal income of 2.59 billion yuan, together with 760 
million yuan of refunded tax income and a net proportion of 
central fiscal revenue [jing shang hua zhong yang cai zheng 0403 
0006 0439 0022 1135 6299 2398], giving a total of 3.35 billion 
yuan, which represents a comparable increase of 18.4 percent. 
Fiscal expenditure of 4.09 billion yuan, an increase of 6.3 
percent. Total value of commodity imports of $1.8 billion, an 
increase of 8 percent. Total value of exports of $960 million, 
an increase of 6.1 percent. Per-capita net income for peasants 
of 1,100 yuan, an increase of 8.3 percent. The increase in 
commodity retail prices will be kept under about 15 percent. 
The total population at year end will be 7.137 million, a 
natural rate of increase of 15.77 per thousand. 
  II. Key reform measures 
  This year is a crucial year in implementing the spirit of 
the 
"Decision" taken by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and in promoting economic structural reform. 
We will, in accordance with unified deployments by the central 
authorities, actively push forward the various aspects of 
reform, place stress on studying the new situations and new 
problems in reform, and continuously guide reform to deeper 
levels. 
<H5>  1. Taking company system transformation as the focal point, </H5>
and speeding the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
  We will speed the coordinated reforms in transforming 
enterprise operational mechanisms. We will earnestly promote 
the three types of systems reform within enterprises, carry out 
in an overall way the reform of the enterprise personnel system 
and reform of the leadership system, and implement a system of 
manager (director) responsibility under the leadership of a 
board of directors. We will abolish the administrative 
department jurisdictional relationships, and implement 
management by industry. We will abolish the administrative 
grades of enterprises, remove the various status distinctions 
between enterprise staff and workers, and implement an overall 
system of labor contracts for all personnel. This will allow 
staff and workers to freely flow between enterprises under 
different ownership systems and in different regions, thereby 
achieving a situation where enterprises can freely decide on 
whom they employ and laborers can freely decide on for whom they 
work. 
  The implementation of the company system in state-owned 
enterprises is a beneficial exploration in the establishing of a 
modern enterprise system. This year, we will carry out the 
company system transformation of several major state-owned 
enterprises under the industrial and communications systems of 
our province, so as to transform mechanisms and strengthen vigor. 
  We will actively promote the readjustment of enterprise 
organizational structures. In accordance with the demands of 
the market economy, we will adopt various modes, including 
merging, leasing, contracts, auction and equity transfer to 
gradually realize the flow of enterprise property rights, to 
optimize asset deployment, and to optimize industrial 
structures. Urban collective enterprises, township and town 
enterprises and nongovernment science and technology enterprises 
will, through diverse forms, be gradually reorganized as 
cooperative shareholding enterprises. Some might also be 
reorganized as joint-stock companies. 
  We will accelerate the establishment of a property rights 
trading market, organize some property rights trade fairs on a 
trial basis and encourage the circulation of various types of 
property rights in the market. State-owned assets stock should 
also see optimized deployment through the property rights 
market. We will actively create conditions so that more 
enterprises participate in experiments involving cross-holdings 
by corporate entities. 
<H5>  2. Rationally readjusting the fiscal system of the cities </H5>
and counties, and implementing in an overall way a modern tax 
levying system. 
  This is the first year in which we are implementing the 
revenue- sharing system reform, and also the second year in 
which our province is implementing the fourth-round [di si lun 
4574 0934 6544] city and county fiscal system. In order to 
better link up our province's fourth-round city and county 
fiscal system with the revenue-sharing system, we will, in 
accordance with the ideas and requirements of the 
revenue-sharing system, take as base figures the revenue and 
expenditure set down by the fourth-round city and county fiscal 
system. Then, first in Haikou, we will implement 
revenue-sharing between the province and the city, and for the 
other cities and counties, we will carry out appropriate 
readjustment in accordance with the existing system. This year 
we need to implement throughout the province a modern tax 
levying and management system, and on the basis of a 
computerized tax-computation system in Haikou City, we will 
establish a Hainan electronic tax levy service center. This will 
form an overall system, to be used by the central authorities, 
the province and the city. 
  We will continue to perfect a "fair, light and simple" 
taxation system. While implementing the unified national tax 
laws, in accordance with the tax levying management jurisdiction 
assigned to our province by the central authorities, and 
proceeding from reality, we will organically combine strict tax 
levying management with the low tax policies of the special 
zone. The preferential policies of the Hainan Special Economic 
Zone will have to be maintained and kept relatively stable, so 
as to create the economic conditions by which to continue to 
draw in domestic and foreign funds. 
  We will reform the funds-use management methods and employ 
fiscal funds to support enterprises' technological progress. 
Funds management will mainly rely on fiscal management, while 
project feasibility will mainly be decided by enterprises and 
industrial departments. In accordance with the industrial 
policies and the principle of compensated use, disregarding 
ownership type, we will stress support for high-technology and 
new-product development by our province's local enterprises, as 
well as investment projects with good results. 
  Fiscal budgetary management will be strengthened. In future, 
all administrative levies will be included in the budget. At 
the same time, it will be necessary to strengthen supervision 
over and management of extrabudgetary funds. 
<H5>  3. Bringing into play the superiorities of the special zone </H5>
and speeding up the formation of an open, externally oriented 
economic structure. 
  We will reform the management methods in respect of 
enterprises' external operational powers and, within a certain 
scope, operations will be freed. The management method of 
import and export quotas and targets will be reformed and 
gradually we will abolish mandatory planned management and the 
system of administrative examination and approval of imports and 
exports. 
  With respect to the import and export quotas handed 
down by the state, in a way which is beneficial, fair and open, 
we will implement a system of calling for tenders for the quotas 
and licenses or will have a standardized means of distribution 
so that we can use the mechanism of competition to invigorate 
external economic relations. 
  We will strengthen cooperation with the outside in order to 
speed the development of Hainan's resources. In the development 
of basic tourist facilities, the development of tropical 
agriculture resources, the building of basic agricultural 
facilities and the development and utilization of marine 
resources, it is possible to widely solicit business 
participation from outside and to develop those areas, using 
forms such as joint equity, cooperation, sole- funding and joint 
operations. 
  We will allow those Hainan enterprises with the conditions 
to 
adopt various forms by which to directly invest abroad and 
develop multinational operations. 
<H5>  4. Reforming the management system using a standardized </H5>
highways and communication levy, and improving the method of 
comprehensive compensation for investment in basic facilities. 
  Beginning 1 January this year we implemented the "Hainan 
Special Economic Zone Management Measures on the Levying of a 
Value-Added Charge on Motor-Vehicle Fuel" and abolished all road 
checkpoints. We "combined the four charges into one" by 
combining the highway maintenance levy, the bridge-crossing 
levy, the road levy and the highway transport levy into a 
single, value-added levy on motor-vehicle fuel. We have 
reformed the system of diverse levies and established a levying 
and examination bureau for provincial communications 
standardized levies. This bureau will take on, in a unified 
way, the work of levying and examining standard highway and 
communication levies. We have implemented a fuel sellers and 
operators licensing system so as to strengthen management over 
fuel sales, in order to resolve well the problem of fuel 
supplies for non-vehicle use. We have established a standard 
levy use system so as to strengthen management over the standard 
levy income. 
  5. Implementing overall reform of the urban housing 
system. We will concurrently carry out leasing, sale and 
construction (that is, supply subsidies, provide preferential 
conditions for purchase of housing, and raise funds to build new 
houses), with sales as the main part of the policy, so as to 
speed the sale of public housing. At the same time, we will 
seriously resolve problems in the sale of houses, such as 
property rights transfer, and socialized service management for 
housing following sales, so as to eliminate future worries for 
staff and workers. We will establish a complete housing fund 
management system to handle well the reinvestment of funds 
obtained through the sale of houses, and realize a fine cycle of 
investment in housing construction. We will readjust the 
structure of the real estate industry, implement the "peaceful 
abode project," issue mortgage credit, and speed the 
construction of economical and comfortable housing, so as to 
improve people's living conditions and to guide and protect the 
healthy development of the real estate market. 
<H5>  6. With the implementation of old-age pensions, industrial </H5>
injury pensions, unemployment benefits and medical and health 
insurance as the focal points, we will deepen the reform of the 
social security system. 
  The range of cover of the various types of social security 
will be expanded from the staff and workers of the various types 
of enterprises to the persons who work in administrative and 
institutional units and to individual laborers. All central 
units based in Hainan will be included in local arrangements. 
At the same time, we will grasp well social security 
experimental work in some prosperous villages. 
  We will speed the reform of medical and health insurance and 
establish a medical and health insurance system for society in 
which personal medical and health accounts are combined with 
unified overall medical and health arrangements for major 
illnesses. In some of the prosperous villages we could, on the 
basis of voluntary participation, establish a major illness 
medical and health insurance system which is in accord with the 
level of economic development of the village. 
<H5>  7. Speeding the structural reform of the administrative and </H5>
institutional units. 
  This year, in accordance with the unified deployments by the 
central authorities, we must engage in reform of the structures 
of provincial, city and county party and government organs. The 
focus of the structural reform will be the transformation of the 
government's economic management function. In accordance with 
the principle of separation of government and enterprise 
functions, and the separation of the government's socioeconomic 
management function and its function as the representative of 
the owners of state assets, we must make efforts to put in order 
the relationship between the government and enterprises, 
continually raise the government's ability to use indirect 
regulatory and control measures, such as economic measures and 
legal measures, to manage the economy, and limit administrative 
measures to the scope where they have to be used. In 
conjunction with this, we must speed the implementation of a 
civil servant system and, on the basis of implementing 
differential management for cadres, we must gradually achieve a 
situation where some of the workers in administrative and 
institutional units move toward society. 
<H5>  8. Continuing to deepen rural reform. </H5>
  We will reform the rural economy's organizational forms so 
that rural production moves toward enterprise operations. 
Relying on farms, comprehensive experimental agricultural 
development areas, agricultural enterprises, and large 
specialized rural households, we will guide the dispersed rural 
households to link up through all sorts of modes, so that they 
can carry out production operations in accordance with market 
demand, and greatly develop economies of scale. 
  We must 
fully bring into play the role of transport and marketing 
enterprises for agricultural products so that they become 
backbone forces for our province's agriculture and spur on the 
development of the rural market economy. 
  We will reform the rural circulation service system. The 
basic avenue in resolving the problem of sales of agricultural 
and sideline products lies in actively guiding and supporting 
the peasants to enter the circulation sphere. We need to 
establish a marketing contingent in which the peasants are the 
the main part, so as to form an integrated production, sales and 
processing service system. In accordance with the degree of 
specialization and scale of operations, we must help to build 
rural enterprises or specialized rural associations such as an 
aquatic producers association, a vegetable farmers association, 
a sugar-cane farmers association and so on, in which peasants 
constitute the main part. Governments at all levels must 
encourage and safeguard fair competition, let market entities 
diversify, firmly eliminate illegally established obstacles, and 
prohibit the various departments from arbitrarily levying 
charges in the circulation links. In this way, the entire 
provincial agricultural and sideline product market will form an 
unimpeded circulation network. 
<H5>  III. The main tasks of our work </H5>
<H5>  1. Strengthening the building of a legal system in the </H5>
special zone and earnestly doing well in planning work. 
  In order for a socialist market economy structure to be more 
speedily established in our province, we must fully utilize the 
legislative power which the National People's Congress [NPC] has 
given to our province, positively learn from and draw in 
international practices, and earnestly grasp well the work of 
legislation in the special zone. We must seriously organize the 
implementation of the provincial government's 1994 legislative 
plan and tightly grasp the drawing up of legislative plans for 
the next five years. Through legislation, we will standardize 
the activities of market entities, readjust market exchange 
relations, safeguard the normal order of the market and promote 
the building of clean government and of spiritual civilization. 
We must gradually establish a socialist legal system which has 
a complete range of legislation, under which the law is firmly 
enforced, in which there is effective supervision and in which 
there is full legal consultancy service. In the various spheres 
of market competition, it is necessary to handle all matters in 
accordance with laws and regulations, to create conditions for 
fair, equal and open market competition, and to firmly strike at 
actions which bend the law for friends or relatives and at 
illegal actions. In respect of the actions of the government 
itself, we must also gradually create a situation where the laws 
and regulations standardize and restrain government actions, so 
that the government acts in accordance with the law. We must 
continue to do well in the "5 February" law popularization work, 
so as to raise consciousness of the law among all people. 
  We must place great stress on planning work. Economic and 
social development must be carried out in a planned and 
step-by-step way. In accordance with the requirements of the 
"Hainan Province National Economic and Social Development Eighth 
Five-Year Plan and 10-Year Program" the planning departments 
must tightly grasp the formulation and revising of the "Hainan 
Province Comprehensive National Land-Use Plan" and begin 
formulating the Ninth Five-Year Plan. Governments and 
departments at all levels must, as quickly as possible, 
formulate development plans for their region or their 
department, seriously implement the planned measures and 
guarantee the realization of the planning blueprint. 
<H5>  2. With the increasing of peasants income as the target, we </H5>
must put great efforts into the rural economy. 
  The greatest difference between the Hainan Special Economic 
Zone and other special economic zones is that it has 
wide-ranging rural areas. Agriculture and rural industry are 
major components of our province's economic work. Striving to 
increase the income of the peasants is a crucial element in 
reducing the differential between industry and agriculture, 
developing public welfare undertakings in rural society, raising 
purchasing power in rural areas and promoting the development of 
the rural market. In accelerating the development of the rural 
economy, first we must put great efforts into readjusting 
agriculture and the economic structure of the rural areas. The 
various cities and counties must begin by doing well with 
regional plans for the agricultural economy and setting down a 
regional deployment for productive forces, with the building of 
commodity grain bases, vegetable bases, economic crop bases, 
livestock- and poultry-breeding bases, and agricultural product 
processing bases as the focal points. Within the rural economy, 
the proportion of secondary and tertiary industry should be 
increased and the transfer of surplus rural labor to 
high-efficiency industries should be accelerated. We need to 
fully bring into play the natural advantages of our province and 
centralize funds to do well in the building of 
fine-strain-variety bases, in propagating fine strains, and in 
optimizing the agricultural product structure. We must continue 
to develop aquatic breeding and ocean harvesting industries, so 
as to build Hainan swiftly into a major aquatic product 
province. Second, in accordance with the demands of the 
socialist market economy, we will continue to perfect the 
dual-level operational system which has household output-related 
contracts as the main element, to actively promote rural 
cooperative shareholding enterprises and joint-stock 
enterprises, to develop rural production and operation 
organizations in which production and sales are combined, to 
grasp well the building of socialized service systems in the 
rural areas and to spur on the overall development of the rural 
economy. 
  Third, we will earnestly safeguard the interests of 
the peasants, stabilize grain production, and tightly grasp the 
"vegetable basket" project. The various cities and counties 
must all formulate plans for protected cultivation areas, 
establish a number of permanent high-output fields, and firmly 
control the use of cultivated land. We must gradually increase 
the investment in agriculture and improve basic agricultural 
facilities. We must continue to grasp well the work of reducing 
the peasants' burden, and must systematize and prescribe by law 
a rational burden for the peasants. We must gradually raise and 
increasingly free the purchase prices for agricultural products, 
so as to continually raise the peasants' income. Fourth, we 
must continually uphold the principle of using science and 
technology to invigorate agriculture, and speed the development 
of township and town enterprises. With the fostering of persons 
skilled in using science and technology in the rural areas as a 
focal point, we must stabilize the agricultural science and 
technology contingent, strive to spread practical scientific and 
technological achievements, raise the rate of transformation of 
scientific and technological achievements and the rate at which 
practical technology enters households, and raise the quality of 
labor. This year, it is planned that the overall output value 
of township and town enterprises will grow 64.1 percent and 
reach 7.5 billion yuan. We must set our sights on both domestic 
and international markets and put efforts into developing our 
island's resource-processing industries as well as other 
labor-intensive industries which are in accord with the 
characteristics of the rural areas. With the townships and 
towns as well as the ports at the mainstays, we should create 
and develop a large swathe of township and town industrial 
areas. Fifth, we must speed the building of a rural market 
system and gradually form a market network in which facilities 
are complete, deployments are rational, information flows 
freely, comprehensive markets and specialized markets are 
combined, futures markets and spot markets are combined and 
where primary agricultural product markets and highly processed 
agricultural product markets coexist. 
  We need to fully bring into play the demonstration role of 
the state-owned farms and comprehensive agricultural development 
experimental areas, so as to speed the development of the rural 
market economy. The various farms must do well in readjustment 
of the industrial structure and, on the basis of grasping 
agriculture, develop processing industries and tertiary 
industry. In order to establish the production and operational 
autonomy of the farms, it might be possible to establish various 
companies based on specialties or industries. It might also be 
possible to turn the existing regions or teams into companies. 
We must allow the state-owned farms to use their land as their 
share contribution, draw in domestic and foreign funds and take 
the road of the shareholding system, so as to speed the 
development of the state-owned farm economy. In respect of the 
agricultural comprehensive development experimental zones, we 
must further clarify property rights relationships, speed 
transformation through cooperative shareholdings, and gradually 
realize the goal of turning them into companies. 
<H5>  3. With the improving of benefits as the focus, earnestly </H5>
grasping industrial and communications production. 
  This is a year for deepening reform in an overall way. The 
external environment for enterprises will undergo very great 
changes and this will provide both opportunities and challenges 
for our province's industrial and communications enterprises. 
We must take development of the market as a target, take the 
raising of enterprise quality and the improving of economic 
results as the focal points, and strengthen enterprise capacity 
to meet changes and to compete. We need to increase investment, 
draw in advanced technology from within the country and abroad, 
speed the technological transformation of enterprises and put 
efforts into developing new products. The quality and volume of 
the products of our province's construction, natural beverages, 
pharmaceutical, clothing, electronics and vehicle industries 
must be greatly improved and increased. This year we must speed 
the pace of construction in the industrial base areas, including 
Laocheng, Jinpai, Chahe, Basuo and Jinshan. Our province has a 
wide sea area. We must actively develop and utilize the 
resources of the southern ocean, and develop our province's oil, 
chemical industry and maritime transport industries. We must 
continue to expand the capacity of electricity generating 
stations, and electricity production must be raised to a new 
level. Communications and transport departments must place 
stress on guaranteeing agricultural support transport, transport 
for goods and materials, foreign trade transport and transport 
of the products needed by the people in their lives, and 
guarantee the completion of the state's transport tasks. We 
must continue to increase investment in posts and 
telecommunications and place stress on raising the level of 
telecommunications in the various cities and counties and major 
development areas. 
  We must continue to uphold the strategic policy of 
coordinated development of economic construction and 
environmental protection, further formulate and perfect 
environmental protection laws and regulations, strengthen law 
enforcement in the sphere of environmental protection, firmly 
stop and punish those actions which seriously pollute the 
environment and harm society, and guarantee the healthy 
development of economic construction. We must continue to 
implement the "Product Quality Law," firmly strike at actions 
involving production or sale of fake and poor quality 
commodities, strike at criminal activities such as smuggling, 
safeguard economic order and protect fair competition. 
<H5>  4. Actively developing the two markets, speeding the </H5>
development of tertiary industry. 
  We need to further expand opening up to the outside, 
positively develop the domestic and the foreign market and 
promote the speedy development of tertiary industry. 
  Our 
target is, within five years, to gradually establish a tertiary 
industry structure which has tourism as its main part, which 
offers a complete variety of services, which has rational 
deployment of resources and which is knowledge-intensive. In 
this way, we can form an open, multilevel, multifunction market 
system and comprehensive socialized service system. 
  We must actively draw in foreign funds, technology, skills, 
and management experiences so as to draw the Hainan economy into 
the international market. This year, apart from further doing 
well in the work of attracting businesses, we must switch the 
focus in implementing the memoranda of intention, the agreements 
and the contracts, seriously grasp well follow-up service for 
projects and raise the rate at which promised investment 
arrives, the project commencement rate and the enterprise 
survival rate, so as to strive to achieve a situation where 
every initiated enterprise comes to fruition as a complete 
operational enterprise. There is great potential for economic 
cooperation between Hainan and Taiwan, and there are broad 
prospects. We need to actively create conditions and welcome 
industrial and commercial business people from Taiwan to come 
and invest in and develop Hainan. 
  Centering on the theme "Take a Holiday in Hainan when 
Visiting China in `96," which was decided on by the Chinese 
National Tourism Administration, we must tightly grasp the 
building of tourist facilities, speed the development of tourist 
sites and strongly develop a tourist market, so as to attract a 
greater number of tourists from home and abroad. We need to 
strengthen industry management, seriously implement tourist 
industry quality standards, and draw in foreign hotel chains to 
invest in and manage our province's high-class hotels, so as to 
continually raise the level of management of the tourist 
industry. 
  We must continue to deepen reform of the domestic and 
external foreign trade system, achieve an integration of 
domestic and international trade, open markets and gradually 
form in our province a circulation structure which is in accord 
with general international patterns and operational mechanisms 
and in which diverse economic components coexist. We must as 
quickly as possible provide import and export operational rights 
to Hainan enterprises, and encourage domestic and foreign 
enterprises of all sorts to travel along a road where trade, 
industry, agriculture and technology are combined and internal 
and external trade are combined. We must speed the development 
of the Yangpu Economic Development Zone, the Haikou Bonded Zone 
and the other bonded stores and warehouses. We must further 
expand opening up to the outside and expand the operational 
scale of border trade. We must positively promote the strategy 
of market pluralization, strengthen the building of export 
production bases and actively open up international markets, and 
help and assist poor regions in developing domestic and 
international trade. 
  We must grasp the opportunity, speed the pace of 
readjustment 
of the structure of financial organizations, do well in the work 
of separating and delimiting policy-nature financial business 
from commercial-nature financial business, and speed the 
track-changing by state-owned commercial banks. We must further 
develop and perfect the financial market, actively strive to 
establish local Hainan stock company commercial banks, establish 
urban cooperative banks and rural cooperative banks, positively 
develop financial intermediary organs and promote the electronic 
transformation of the finance business. It is necessary to 
standardize financial actions, readjust the structure of credit, 
ensure firm discipline in account settling and establish a fine 
financial order. We must set up financing centers, develop an 
international funds market, actively raise funds, enliven stored 
funds, improve funds-use benefits and support the economic 
construction of Hainan. 
<H5>  5. Optimizing the investment structure, continuing to speed </H5>
the construction of key projects. 
  In accordance with the basic requirements of the state 
investment structure reforms, our province must formulate and 
implement the "Hainan Special Economic Zone Regulations on 
Comprehensive Compensation for Investment in Basic Facilities," 
and strengthen the stimulatory power of industrial policies. We 
must optimize the investment structure and continue to speed the 
construction of key projects. The planned investment in 
Hainan's key projects during 1994 is 7 billion yuan, which will 
guarantee the construction of 24 key projects. In addition, 
there are 10 key construction projects for which advance 
preparatory work has to be done. The most important of the 
major tasks in basic construction for our province this year are 
to have the Fenghuang Airport ready for flights, to link up the 
Eastern line high-speed highway, and to put into production on 
time the Daguangba Electricity Plant and the Nanshan Electricity 
Plant. We must complete these on time. The work on Meilan 
Airport at Haikou and the third-stage project of the Haikou 
Electricity Plant must also soon be commenced. For key 
construction projects, we must further open up funding channels, 
encourage investors from all sides to compete equally, and 
achieve a pluralization of investment entities. We must 
establish and perfect a corporate responsibility system for 
projects, actively implement a project supervisory system, 
guarantee project quality, reduce construction periods and 
improve investment benefits. 
<H5>  6. Seriously grasping the work of assisting the poor, and </H5>
speeding the economic development of the "three types of 
regions." 
  We must implement preferential policies in respect of old 
revolutionary base areas, minority nationality areas and 
poverty-stricken areas, and help the people in these areas shake 
off poverty and become prosperous as quickly as possible. With 
the market as guidance, we must readjust the industrial 
structure of the "three types of areas," and guide the people in 
these areas in tapping the potential of local natural resources, 
in greatly developing planting and rearing industries, 
agricultural and sideline product processing industries and 
township and town industries. 
  We need to mobilize the broad masses of people to give play 
to their spirit of self-reliance, so that they invest funds and 
invest work in developing the economy in order to resolve the 
problems of food, clothing and shelter. We need to help young 
people in the "three types of areas" to leave agriculture and 
engage in industry. We also need to encourage some of the 
people to get rich first. We must continue to grasp 
construction of water, electricity, roads and other basic 
facilities in the "three types of areas" and raise the degree to 
which these areas are open to the outside and their degree of 
attraction. We need to actively attract businesses and draw in 
funds, so as to do well in poverty alleviation projects. The 
Baihualing Development Zone in Qiongzhong County and the 
Qizhiling Development Zone in Baoting County must strive to put 
projects in place at an early date and achieve early results. 
It is necessary to strengthen the work of fostering ethnic 
backbone elements and professional and technical training of 
peasants, so as to essentially raise the level of laborers. We 
must continue to grasp well the transformation of housing 
conditions for minority nationalities and resolve their 
difficulties in terms of drinking water, and truly work hard in 
many respects in order to allow the nationality areas to throw 
off poverty and become prosperous. 
<H5>  7. Speeding the progress of science and technology and </H5>
strongly developing education. 
  Science and technology are the primary productive force, and 
in invigorating the economy of the special zones, it is 
necessary to promote science and technology. Governments at all 
levels must continue to implement the strategic policy of "using 
science and technology to invigorate Hainan" and, at the same 
time as actively supporting scientific and technological 
research organs and institutes, they should fully utilize the 
relaxed environment of the special economic zone to powerfully 
develop all types of nongovernment scientific and technological 
enterprises. We need to foster and develop a science and 
technology market, formulate "Hainan Provincial Measures for 
Managing the Technological Market," encourage the rational flow 
of skilled scientific and technological personnel, and promote 
the drawing in, absorption and transformation of scientific and 
technological achievements. We must seriously implement laws 
protecting intellectual property rights, respect the results of 
the work of scientific and technological workers, protect their 
legitimate rights and promote the rapid transformation of 
scientific and technological results into modern productive 
forces. Cooperation and interflow with scientific and 
technological circles both at home and abroad must be 
strengthened, so as to promote the development of science and 
technology in our province. 
  We must further clarify the guiding ideology that education 
is the key link, continue to increase investment in education, 
and levy education surcharges in accordance with the law. We 
must further increase education facilities, transform the 
dangerous buildings currently used for primary and middle 
schools, improve education conditions, truly implement nine 
years of mandatory education and continue to reform the tertiary 
education system and the system of employment assignment for 
graduates of middle and tertiary vocational schools. We must 
implement autonomy in education for tertiary institutions, 
optimize specialist structures and increase the vigor of 
tertiary institutions. It is also necessary to powerfully 
develop professional and technical education and adult 
education, firmly complete the task of eliminating illiteracy 
among 30,000 persons, and combine anti-illiteracy education with 
the study of practical technologies. Schools of all types at 
all levels must implement the party's education policies in an 
overall way and put efforts into raising the quality and 
benefits of education. We need to widely propagate and 
seriously implement the "Teachers Law of the PRC," safeguard the 
legitimate rights of teachers, improve the remuneration and 
conditions of teachers and create a fine living and working 
environment for teachers, so as to form throughout the province 
a fine practice of placing importance on education. We need to 
strengthen the building of a teaching contingent, and 
continually raise the quality of teachers so as to accord with 
the demands of developing education. 

<H5>    8. Bringing prosperity to the special zone's culture, </H5>
promoting the development of the special zone's sports and 
health undertakings. 
  In bringing further prosperity to the socialist special zone 
culture, we must stress the development of literature and 
culture, news and publishing, and broadcasting and film, so as 
to provide the people of the province with sufficient spiritual 
food. It is necessary to consolidate the socialist cultural 
front and speed the construction of basic cultural facilities 
such as the provincial color television center, the Haikou 
library, and the performance theater, and the building of a 
basic cultural contingent. At the same time, we must place 
stress on the building of rural cultural bases, widely develop 
mass cultural and entertainment activities, and continue to do 
well in terms of the "1,000-li round-the-island cultural 
corridor," and newly construct a number of demonstration points. 
We need to further expand the area which radio broadcasts and 
television can reach, enrich the contents of radio and 
television programs, and raise the quality of programs. We must 
strengthen management of the cultural market, so as to promote 
its healthy development. We must strengthen the building of a 
sports contingent and raise the competitive level of sports 
competitors. Schools need to stress physical education, so that 
students develop in an overall way. We need to widely develop 
mass sports activities so as to strengthen people's physical 
stature. Over the next two years we should build a number of 
sports facilities in Haikou and Sanya to resolve the problem of 
a lack of sports venues in these cities. 
  We must continue to do well in archival, historical and 
gazetteer-compilation work. 
  At the same time as grasping well medical and health work 
in the cities, we must place the focus of medical and health 
work on the rural areas. We must continue to strengthen the 
three types of health construction in the rural areas and strive 
within two years to transform 100 rural hospitals and raise the 
level of rural medical and health care. We must also strengthen 
the work of guarding against and treating parasitic infections 
in the rural areas, and strive to bring the incidence of 
infectious diseases down by more than 5 percent as compared with 
last year. We must earnestly do well in urban health 
management, improve health conditions, beautify the urban 
environment, and strengthen the enforcement of and supervision 
over health laws. We must seriously implement the "PRC Law on 
Safeguarding Women's Rights and Interests," protect the 
legitimate rights of women and children, and do well in mother 
and child health care work. We must continue to implement the 
basic national policies on family planning, seriously grasp well 
the implementation of population and family planning target 
responsibility systems, put an end to the phenomena of false 
reporting and under-reporting of family size, and firmly realize 
the population control plans for this year. 
<H5>  9. We must continue to strengthen work in terms of social </H5>
order, opposing corruption and promoting clean government, as 
well as work in external affairs and overseas Chinese affairs, 
and improve the social environment of the special zone. 
  Maintaining social stability and creating a fine social 
environment are preconditions for Hainan's reform, opening up 
and development, and are also the ardent hopes of the broad 
number of investors and the masses. I want to especially stress 
that governments at all levels must continue to uphold the 
policy of "grasping with both hands and ensuring that both hands 
have a tight grip," and earnestly strengthen the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. It is necessary to seriously 
implement the "Regulations on the Comprehensive Improvement of 
Social Order," to strengthen the function of the people's 
democratic dictatorship, to correctly handle the two 
contradictions of different natures, to firmly strike at various 
types of criminal activities, and to adopt firm measures to 
guard against and restrict the occurrence of malignant cases. 
We must strengthen militia work and reserve service work, fully 
bring into play the political superiority of the socialist 
system in terms of achieving full cooperation, firmly uphold the 
principle of combining specialized work and the mass line, 
uphold the fine practice of joint actions by the military, the 
police and the people, widely and deeply mobilize the strengths 
of all sides of society to grasp and handle problems together, 
and truly implement, at the basic level and in every household, 
the various measures for comprehensive improvement of social 
order. Law enforcement departments must strengthen the building 
of their own contingents and raise both the quality of law 
enforcement personnel and the quality of law enforcement itself. 
The broad masses must strengthen their consciousness of the law 
and great efforts should be put into citing advanced persons and 
incidents which demonstrate conscious observance of the law and 
a willingness to struggle against illegal activities. In this 
way, social order will be brought onto the track whereby matters 
are handled in accordance with the law. 
  We must continue to strengthen the work of opposing 
corruption and promoting clean government. The government must 
strengthen the building of systems, so that loopholes can be 
blocked on both the systems and procedural levels. Thereby, it 
will be possible to guard against the occurrence of corruption 
and unhealthy trends. We must pay attention to the education 
and training of cadres, raise the political quality and 
professional level of cadres, change the style of work, overcome 
bureaucratism, establish a truth-seeking and pragmatic 
workstyle, firmly enforce work discipline in organs, and raise 
work efficiency. We must fully bring into play the functional 
roles of the supervisory departments and the judicial organs, 
continue to wage the struggle against corruption, organize 
forces to investigate and handle major cases involving graft and 
bribery, and seriously strike at the activities of economic 
criminals. At the same time, we must continue specific work to 
rectify improper practices within specific spheres, so as to 
promote the building of clean government in the government 
organs of our province. 
  Departments involved with external affairs and overseas 
Chinese affairs must utilize their own superiorities, make 
efforts to spread information about Hainan, raise awareness 
abroad about Hainan, actively facilitate the drawing in of 
funds, technologies and skilled persons from abroad, and provide 
convenience for the foreign business people who come to invest 
in and do business in Hainan. It is necessary to widely make 
known and implement the "PRC Law on Safeguarding the Rights and 
Interests of Returned Overseas Chinese and Their Relatives," so 
as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of returned 
overseas Chinese and their relatives. We must also widely 
develop activities of supporting the Army and giving 
preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and 
martyrs, strengthen the unity between the Army and the 
government and the Army and the people, and bring into play the 
special role of the people's military forces in building the 
special zone. The people's governments at all levels must 
strengthen socialist democracy and the building of the legal 
system, strengthen the concept of the law, consciously accept 
supervision by the people, seriously implement the resolutions 
of the NPC and its standing committee, and firmly engage in 
administration in accordance with the law. 
  Fellow Deputies! 
  The year 1994 is an important year for our province in 
deepening reform, expanding opening up and accelerating 
development. The situation is good and such an opportunity is 
difficult to come by. In the new year, under the guidance of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council, the people of all 
nationalities throughout the province must seriously implement 
the spirit of the 14th party congress and the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, liberate their 
thought, work with one heart and one mind, strive arduously, and 
jointly struggle to complete the various national economic and 
social development tasks of our province.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), today called on 
the party members and government officials to uphold the spirit 
of Jiao Yulu (the late party secretary of Lankao County). 
  At a gathering held in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province, 
to mark the 30th anniversary of Jiao's death (May 14th), Hu was 
entrusted by General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee 
Jiang Zemin to deliver a speech today. He said that Jiao Yulu 
was an excellent member of the CPC recognized by the whole party 
and all the people of Chinese nationalities. 
  Jiao dedicated his life to the improvement of people's lives 
and production in Lankao County in the early 1960s and his deeds 
were regarded as a fine example in China. 
  Hu said that over the past three decades, Jiao's spirit and 
deeds have inspired tens of millions of party members, officials 
and people to advance. 
  He said that under the new conditions when China is building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, party members and 
officials should cling to the principle of serving the people 
whole-heartedly, carry forward and uphold the fine tradition of 
making close links with the people, and work hard to open up new 
development situations. 
  He stressed that party members should uphold Jiao's 
down-to-earth working style, trust and rely on the people, seek 
truth from facts, work hard, and be honest in work to enhance 
the sense of responsibility in building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, improve capacity and the party's leadership, 
fight corruption and promote party construction. 
  Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan provincial party 
committee, and other party officials also made speeches at the 
gathering.

  [Text] On the invitation of (Oulette), speaker of the 
Aquitaine Regional Assembly in France, the Hubei provincial 
economic delegation led by Guan Guangfu held negotiations on 
economic and technological issues with approximately 40 persons 
in charge of the various departments of the region on the 
evening of 8 May. They reached a consensus on six areas, 
including economics, trade, science and technology, and talent 
exchanges. Both sides held a solemn ceremony late at night on 9 
May to commemorate the signing of the letter of intention on 
establishing economic and technological cooperation ties. 
  The Aquitaine region is the world's largest wine and brandy 
production base. Not only is the region developed in 
agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but it also a 
production base for high technology products, such as aircraft, 
electronic, and medical equipment. The region attached great 
importance to the Hubei economic delegation's current visit and 
held a grand welcome banquet in honor of the delegation in the 
small hours of the morning. 
  In a speech expressing his gratitude, Guan Guangfu said: The 
relations between Hubei and the Aquitaine region should be like 
the region's Garonne River and Hubei's Chang Jiang, both of 
which flow endlessly. As one of China's new investment hot 
spots, Hubei Province is pursuing the magnificent goal it 
charted. It is both a construction site and a vast consumption 
market. We can make up for each other's deficiencies by 
developing strong points and striving for common development in 
many areas. 
  Chinese Ambassador to France Cai Fangbo, his wife, and Chen 
Jinren, chief representative to France of the China Council for 
the Promotion of International Trade, attended the negotiations 
and signing ceremony.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei 
Province has found that economic co-operation is an effective 
way to achieve prosperity. According to local officials, over 
the past few years various items of economic co-operations have 
generated an additional output value of 23.4 billion yuan for 
the province, which has netted an extra 3.1 billion yuan of 
profits and taxes from such efforts. 
  The province now has more than 300 economic co-operation 
organizations or agencies of various kinds which are scattered 
across the country and have launched over 60,000 projects of 
economic co-operation, involving a total investment of 17.38 
billion yuan. 
  Economic co-operation organizations have changed the past 
practice of goods exchange into the establishment of regional or 
trans-regional markets and specialized networks, all resulting 
in the enlivening of commodity collection and distribution. 
  Take the grand economic co-operation zone involving 38 
counties and cities in Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan and Guizhou 
Provinces as an example. Last year, this zone carried out 
co-operation projects, and lent and borrowed money worth more 
than 300 million yuan, while forming conglomerates to produce 
and market industrial products, tea and tung oil, which sell 
well in many foreign countries. 
  At the same time, different localities in the province have 
taken the initiative and set out to collect market information, 
promote the marketing of products and launch investment 
promotion events. 
  Last year Hubei established more than 50 economic 
co-operation agencies in coastal and economically-developed 
areas. These agencies have promoted the establishment of 40 
foreign-funded enterprises in the province.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Liu </F>
Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), and XINHUA reporter Zou Aiguo (6760 
1947 0948)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a meeting 
with representatives attending the 10th National Conference on 
Civil Affairs, Premier Li Peng said today that civil affairs 
departments have lots of work to do, and civil affairs must be 
strengthened not weakened. He said: Civil affairs departments 
must always consider it their objective to protect the masses' 
vital interests, and safeguard their basic rights and interests. 
Civil affairs departments must improve grass-roots operations, 
properly manage various social projects, go deep into 
grass-roots units, and use various appropriate ways to help 
local people solve their problems, maintain social order, and 
expedite the healthy development of socialist ethics and 
material progress. 
  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua; State Councillor Li Tieying; and 
leading comrades Chi Haotian, Song Jian, Li Guixian, and Chen 
Junsheng were present at the meeting, which took place at 
Zhongnanhai this morning. Li Guixian chaired the meeting. 
  At the meeting, Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering gave a 
briefing on the national conference on civil affairs and actual 
state of civil affairs in the country. Zhang Ruifeng, vice 
governor of Shandong; Zhang Yuqin, vice governor of Guizhou; Ma 
Lin, director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Civil Affairs 
Department; Zhang Baohuan, director of the Hebei Provincial 
Civil Affairs Department; and Bai Xianjing, director of the 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Civil Affairs Department, took 
the floor at the meeting one after another. 
  In their speeches, they maintained that the conference has 
factually summed up the state of civil affairs in the past five 
years; and that the basic ideas, guiding thought, objectives, 
and principal tasks the conference has put forth are in line 
with the national needs -- reform, development, and stability -- 
as well as the general policy set by the Central Committee. 
They pointed out that civil affairs departments must proceed 
from practical needs, continue to explore new ways to handle 
civil affairs when the nation is embarked on building a 
socialist market economic system, accomplish all assignments 
which the conference has put forth, and improve the overall 
quality of civil affairs so that civil affairs departments can 
give full scope to their functions. 
  In his speech, Li Peng said that the civil affairs 
conference 
has discussed major principles for civil affairs, that the 
meeting was a success, and the results which civil affairs 
departments have achieved over the years have also been quite 
fruitful. Li Peng extended the cordial regards of the CPC 
Central Committee and State Council to the representatives 
attending the conference as well as comrades who have been 
working diligently in the nation's civil affairs departments. 
  Li Peng said: China's reform has entered a crucial period 
since the convocation of the 14th National Party Congress, and 
especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee. When we implement the Central Committee's 
general policy of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
opening up wider to the outside world, expediting development, 
and maintaining stability," the most important thing we must do 
is to properly handle the relationship among reform, 
development, and stability. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Without a 
stable social and political environment, reform and construction 
cannot be successful." This is why the Central Committee has 
repeatedly stressed the need to expedite reform and construction 
while ensuring stability, as well as the need to maintain 
long-term social stability through reform and construction. 
Maintaining social stability even has strategic significance 
during the initial period of building our socialist market 
economic system. This is an invaluable experience China has 
gained from carrying out reform over the past decade or so. 
  Li Peng pointed out: Both the central and local 
authorities are grasping social stability because it is an 
important matter. Proceeding from their respective functions, 
various departments should create a good social environment for 
reform and development by solving social contradictions, 
maintaining social stability, and forming a comprehensive 
mechanism for social stability in China. Over the past dozens 
of years, the civil affairs departments have worked very hard 
and played a great role in maintaining social stability by 
solving social problems. Civil affairs personnel have 
constantly visited grass-roots units to convey the party and 
government's concern for dependents of servicemen and 
revolutionary martyrs, demobilized soldiers, bereaved old 
people, disabled children, and impoverished households. They 
are worthy of being called the "oxen" of the masses because 
fearless of hardships, they have insisted on bringing comfort to 
thousands of households. The achievements made in civil affairs 
work over the past four decades reflects, on the one hand, the 
superiority of the socialist system in China and, on the other, 
represents a sound return blow against hostile forces in the 
West who attack China on the question of human rights. Once we 
have done our civil affairs work well, we will be able to create 
a good social environment for economic construction, thereby 
promoting coordinated social and economic development. 
  Li Peng said: As natural disasters are common in China, 
every year a large number of people become their victims. 
Also, there are bereaved old folks, sick and disabled people, 
low-income people, and others who have social difficulties. The 
majority of these people whose living conditions are rather 
poor, live in rural areas. Therefore, governments at all levels 
should pay special attention to the question of poverty existing 
in some rural areas. He said: We should change the current 
method of relying solely on government relief. We should 
broaden the method by gradually establishing a system by which 
governments at various levels share responsibility for providing 
relief. 
  Li Peng pointed out: In the new situation, the civil affairs 
departments should continue to emancipate their minds, deepen 
reform, effectively carry out their functions, protect the 
people's rights and interests, basic living conditions, regulate 
social relations, alleviate social contradictions, solve social 
problems, and do a good job in maintaining social stability and 
promoting the building of a socialist spiritual civilization. 
In particular, the civil affairs departments should play a 
greater role in safeguarding society, in promoting national 
defense, and in building grass-roots political power and 
basic-level self-governing organizations. 
  Li Peng expressed the hope that party committees and 
governments, proceeding from the overall purpose of reform, 
development, and stability, will pay special attention to civil 
affairs work; make it an important item on their agendas; and 
effectively strengthen leadership over this work. He expressed 
the conviction that under the leadership of the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, cadres and 
workers on the civil affairs front will achieve more brilliant 
results and make greater contributions to promoting economic 
development and social stability in China if they continue to 
carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, 
fear no hardships, overcome difficulties, boldly open up new 
channels, and work hard in unity. 
  Attending the discussion meeting were Chen Jinhua, minister 
of the State Planning Commission; Tao Siju, minister of public 
security; Liu Zhongli, minister of finance; Song Defu, minister 
of personnel; and responsible persons of the relevant 
departments under the State Council.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Stability was the 
watchword stressed by Chinese Premier Li Peng when he spoke here 
today to an ongoing national conference of civil affairs 
officials. 
  He stressed the need for all staffs to do their utmost to 
help people overcome difficulties in their life and work, 
maintain social order and promote material and cultural progress. 
  He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying that without a stable 
social and political environment, it would be impossible to 
carry out reforms or construction. 
  "In the early period of establishing a socialist market 
economic structure, it is of strategic importance to maintain 
social stability," he told the delegates. 
  This was an invaluable experience which China has acquired 
through reforms over the past ten-plus years, he added. 
  He praised civil affairs departments for their work over the 
past decades to maintain social stability by solving various 
kinds of social problems. 
  "The success in civil affairs work will help create a fine 
social environment for China's economic construction, thus 
promoting the coordinated social and economic development," he 
said. 
  The premier also urged governments at all levels to pay 
close 
attention to solving the problem of poverty in rural areas. 
  He said that it was necessary to reform the present system 
under which people relied solely on the government for relief, 
and to institute a new system for relief work at different 
levels. 
  He called on civil affairs staffs to make still greater 
contributions to maintaining social stability and promoting 
cultural progress by protecting the people's interests and 
rights, regulating social relations and solving social problems.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- China's main leader Deng 
Xiaoping has criticized President Jiang Zemin for attempting to 
create his own faction to boost his power base, a Japanese 
newspaper reported Tuesday [17 May]. 
  The TOKYO SHIMBUN, quoting "reliable Chinese sources," said 
the 89-year-old Deng had been grooming Jiang, 67, as the central 
figure in a group leadership intended to succeed him. 
  But a recent departure from Jiang's previous "moderate 
stance" sparked Deng's attack, according to the paper. 
  The paper quoted Deng as saying Jiang, a former mayor of 
Shanghai, is trying to form a new "Shanghai group." 
  Deng cited Jiang's appointments of top police and military 
personnel, saying they were made without his being informed, the 
paper said. 
  Among those cited was the appointment early last year of 
Jiang's associate Ba Zhongtan to the post of commander of the 
Chinese people's armed police forces. 
  The paper quoted the sources as saying Deng spoke of the 
need 
to fill posts from among candidates "sought on a nationwide 
basis without building factions." 
  Deng fears Jiang's actions could split the Chinese Communist 
Party, it said. 
  Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days from April 26, apparently 
to carry out an inspection tour. The sources quoted by the 
newspaper, however, claimed the visit was part of an attempt by 
Jiang to strengthen his power base after being criticized by 
Deng. 
  Jiang served as mayor of Shanghai between 1985 and 1987 and 
as secretary of the Chinese Communist Party's Shanghai Municipal 
Committee between 1985 and 1989. During that time he became 
associated with Ba, who was responsible for security in the 
Shanghai region.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese public security 
departments released former student leader Wang Dan and a crew 
of U.S. television journalists Tuesday [17 May] after detaining 
them for about an hour. 
  "They wanted to know what the interview was about and why I 
was being interviewed. It was nothing," Wang told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE by phone. 
  According to Lucky Severson of U.S. National Broadcasting 
Corp. (NBC), the five-man crew has been at Wang's residence for 
about an hour before police arrived and took them all away. 
  "We were essentially finished with the interview and were 
just getting shots of the residence when they came," he said. 
  The passports, residence permits and videotapes of the crew 
were all taken by police and have not yet been returned, he said. 
  "Wang Dan talked about the status of human rights in China 
and MFN (most-favored-nation trading status)," Severson said, 
saying he felt Wang did not say anything that would bring him 
trouble. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 if China 
has made enough progress in human rights areas to warrant the 
renewal of MFN. Billions of dollars in bilateral trade are at 
stake. 
  Severson said Wang, who was interrogated separately from the 
NBC crew, was "cautious" during the interview. 
  He said none of his crew, composed of several nationalities, 
was threatened or beaten by police.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 (AFP)--Five persons working for the 
U.S. television network NBC were detained by police and 
questioned for two hours after the crew interviewed dissident 
Wang Dan at his Beijing home, relatives of one of the crew said. 
  The crew comprised an American, an Australian, a Filipino 
and 
a Chinese, as well as a Tokyo-based Japanese who was the only 
one of the five without Chinese accreditation, they said. 
  Relatives of Wang said about 10 police burst into his home 
at 
around 11:00 a.m. (0300 GMT) and asked the crew if they had 
official authorisation to carry out the interview. 
  "As they did not have any, the police took them away, along 
with Wang Dan," one said. 
  The NBC crew was taken to the central Beijing offices of a 
branch of the police that is in charge of foreigners in China, 
and was released two hours later. 
  Wang, held for an hour at a police station in his 
neighbourhood, said the police wanted to know how the 
journalists had contacted him and what had been said at the 
meeting. 
  He said the interview focussed on renewal of 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) customs status by the United States, 
the state of human rights in China and his private life.

  [Excerpt] China is preparing to prosecute its most famous 
dissident, Wei Jingsheng, on treason charges for asking the 
United States Government to pressure Beijing for human rights 
improvements, dissident and official sources said yesterday. 
Police have also arrested three Shenzhen-based labour activists 
accused of organising workers in sweatshop factories in southern 
China, according to a Chinese source. 
  Diplomats in Beijing said these hardline measures could 
endanger China's chances for renewal of Most Favoured Nation 
(MFN) trading status with America. The arrests could also 
destroy the points scored by Beijing by its "medical parole" 
recently granted to "black hand" dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen 
Ziming. 
  Dissidents and Justice Ministry sources said top officials 
had decided against a more lenient three-year administrative 
sentence in a labour camp for Wei, who is considered the father 
of China's pro-democracy movement. Instead, Beijing would 
prosecute him on charges of "plotting to overthrow the 
Government using foreign forces", said a source with close ties 
to the Justice Ministry. 
  Wei, 44, angered Chinese leaders when he met U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State for Human Rights John Shattuck in February 
and asked him to use the threat of revoking MFN to gain improved 
treatment of political prisoners. On April 1 he was stopped by 
police as he tried to enter Beijing from a forced exile in 
nearby Tianjin. Four days later police accused Wei, who had 
been released last year after almost 15 years in prison, of 
unspecified new crimes. 
  Authorities had been gathering evidence against the 
outspoken 
Wei since his release on parole last September, including 
alleged evidence that he and his secretary, Tong Yi, who is also 
to be tried, were living together but not married. After his 
April detention government officials allegedly pressured Tong's 
estranged husband to sue her for adultery. Under China's vague 
and arbitrary administrative detention regulations, police could 
then have sentenced both Wei and Tong to long labour camp 
sentences for "lack of morals", thus avoiding a trial, one 
dissident said. Tong's husband did not sue his wife. 
  The prosecution of Wei as a direct result of his contact 
with 
a high-ranking U.S. Government official carries serious 
implications for U.S. President Bill Clinton. The weekend 
parole of Chen Ziming had apparently made Mr Clinton's decision 
on renewing MFN easier. But the prosecution of Wei, who was 
first incarcerated on the personal orders of senior leader Deng 
Xiaoping in 1979 for his calls for political reform, could 
change that. 
  In addition to his alleged collusion with the U.S. 
Government, dissident sources said, Wei could also be prosecuted 
for writing an "illegal" autobiography, as well as his efforts 
to provide financial assistance to blacklisted dissidents. 
  The three other men were arrested for trying to organise an 
independent union in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. They 
had put out two issues of a mimeographed underground newsletter 
that aired worker complaints over low pay, forced overtime and 
unsafe work conditions, and informed workers about laws and 
regulations protecting their interests. A Chinese source 
identified the three as Li Wenmin and Kuang Lezhuang, both 
college students, and Liu Hutang, a factory worker. 
  The first issue of their newsletter attacked authorities for 
allowing a Hong Kong-owned factory in Shenzhen to ignore safety 
regulations, resulting in a fire that killed 84 workers. 
"Rights will not be bestowed on us, but are something we must 
fight for," it urged. "If we unite, we will become a powerful 
force." 
  In March and April, police arrested four Beijing men and 
briefly detained several others suspected of trying to form 
unofficial worker organisations. One of the four escaped from 
prison and fled the country, but the others remain held 
incommunicado without any formal charges. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Since the second 
quarter of the year, public security organs across China, guided 
by party committees and governments at various levels, have 
launched a number of special projects aimed at cracking serious 
crimes, so as to maintain social order and stability in summer. 
  It has been learned that, in their "crackdown" movement, 
public security organs in various localities have insisted on 
proceeding in the light of reality and in line with local 
conditions, targeting conspicuous crimes throughout the 
crackdown, and focusing rectification efforts on localities 
where public order is in chaos. Beijing municipal public 
security organ and such departments as industry and commerce, 
and taxation have coordinated actions to crack down on producing 
and selling fake invoices. Public security organs in Guangdong, 
Fujian, Sichuan, and Liaoning have launched a fight aimed at 
cracking the stealing and robbing of motor vehicles. Shaanxi 
Province's public security organs have launched a fight against 
robbing ancient tombs and smuggling cultural relics. Hebei, 
Zhejiang, Fujian, and Gansu have launched a fight aimed at 
cracking crime rings and evil forces in rural areas. 
Heilongjiang Province has focused crackdown efforts on five 
cities, including Harbin and Qiqihar, where the number of 
criminal cases accounts for half of the province's total. 
Tianjin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Jiangxi, and Guizhou have 
taken actions to rectify disorder in the areas where public 
order is in chaos. 
  Currently, preliminary results have been scored in 
localities' "crackdown" fight. A number of influential cases 
have been cracked and a number of serious criminal elements are 
under arrest. Public security organs in Zhejiang and Anhui, 
guided and coordinated by the Ministry of Public Security, 
cracked the key murder and robbery case of Qiandao Lake and 
arrested three criminal elements within a short time. Since the 
launching of a fight against stealing and robbing motor vehicles 
in April, Guangdong province's public security organs have 
cracked 2,953 cases of the kind, arrested 2,496 criminal 
elements, wiped out 497 crime rings, recovered 353 stolen motor 
vehicles and 1,975 motorcycles, and destroyed 137 spots where 
stolen motor vehicles are disposed of. During the first month 
of its "Spring Offensive" campaign aimed at rectifying public 
order, Hebei Province sent 1,310 work teams of 7,611 people; 
tackled problems in 3,115 villages and towns, 1,289 public 
places, 668 enterprises, and 167 sections of highways or 
railways, where public order is bad; cracked 4,041 criminal 
cases of all kinds; arrested 2,970 criminal elements; wiped out 
265 crime rings; and seized stolen money and goods worth some 
6.62 million yuan.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Song Xuechun (1345 1331 2504) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Zhang Rongda (1728 2837 1129)] 
  [Text] Qingdao, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The national meeting 
attended by directors of the departments (offices) of 
provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal commissions for 
discipline inspection ended here today. The meeting stressed 
that the new situation demands that all these organs 
conscientiously carry out the following three tasks: paying 
attention to the party's policy of reform, development, and 
stability; strengthening their service functions; and pushing 
forward the anticorruption struggle. The meeting also held that 
the important conditions for guaranteeing all these organs to 
better perform their duties lie in bringing into full play their 
role as an assistant, inspector, and coordinator. 
  The meeting affirmed the achievements attained by these 
organs in strengthening the party's work style, building a clean 
and honest government, and fighting against corruption. The 
meeting held that in light of this year's work and the 
anticorruption campaign put forward by the central authorities, 
all these organs should fully play their roles and work harder 
in carrying out the following four tasks. First, it is 
necessary to improve information and statistical work. In this 
way, they can reflect in a timely fashion the new situation, 
problems, and experiences in their anticorruption struggle to 
improve their work system, strengthen dynamic analysis, and 
provide conditions for the better implementation of the 
anticorruption struggle and a basis for formulating policy. 
Second, it is necessary to improve the supervision and 
inspection work. All these organs should focus on carrying out 
the guiding spirit of the third plenary session of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection and on conducting 
extensively the anticorruption struggle. They should enhance 
the quality of their supervision and inspection work and 
promptly receive feedback on the results of their work. Third, 
it is necessary to improve coordination work. They should 
further smooth away the problems in their internal and external 
relations after discipline inspection and supervision units 
began to work together in the same offices. They should assist 
leading comrades in solving new problems cropping up during the 
course of the anticorruption struggle and promote the healthy 
development of such a struggle. Fourth, it is necessary to 
improve the press and public opinion work. They should let the 
public fully understand new results and experiences regarding 
the anticorruption campaign. In dealing with the ideological 
trends inside and outside the party as well as the symptoms, 
tendencies, and work problems in a particular period, they 
should write articles to guide public opinion. 
  Attending the meeting were directors of the departments 
(offices) of the commissions for discipline inspection from all 
provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and cities with 
provincial-level economic decision-making authority; of the Work 
Committee for Organs Under the Central Committee, and of the 
Work Committee for Central Government Organs, as well as 
representatives from excellent information network points. Wang 
Guang, Standing Committee member and general secretary of the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, presided over and 
spoke at the meeting. Directors of the departments (offices) of 
the commissions for discipline inspection from Fujian and other 
13 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities exchanged 
their experiences at the meeting. A total of 13 advanced 
information work units including the Jiangsu Provincial 
Commission for Discipline Inspection and 32 excellent 
information network points including the Commission for 
Discipline Inspection of Yuncheng Prefecture were commended at 
the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing has set a high-level party inspection team 
to Hunan to investigate the case of a mayor who illegally 
imprisoned a local councillor for nearly a year. The case, 
which may have been a factor in the recent leadership shake-up 
in Hunan province, could set an important precedent by limiting 
local cadres' power to abuse security organs as a tool to 
intimidate political enemies and critics. 
  Yan Yueming was put under lock and key in the detention 
centre at Loudi in central Hunan in March 1992 after he gathered 
signatures from 100 local cadres to dismiss the mayor, Zhao 
Bodong, on grounds of incompetence. The decision to send a 
special investigation team to look into the case is a victory 
for the plucky Yan, who took on local Communist Party officials 
during his two-year crusade for justice. Yan was held 
incommunicado for more than nine months until the Hunan 
government-prodded by those who had signed the petition -- 
demanded his release in early 1993. 
  Three senior leaders -- Tian Jiyun, a politburo member, an 
NPC vice-chairman, Wang Hanbin, and the Supreme Court president, 
Ren Jianxin -- have been appointed to oversee the investigation. 
"The central government disagrees with the province's handling 
of the case," a party propaganda official in Beijing told 
Eastern Express. "They will carry out a supplementary 
investigation and likely reach a new conclusion," the official, 
one of eight cadres sent to look into the case last December, 
said. 
  A provincial investigation team which issued an internal 
report last November meted out no punishment to Zhao. Instead 
he was promoted to head the Loudi district public security 
office. Frustrated by the lack of justice, Yan trekked to the 
capital in March this year to make his case before delegates to 
the National Peoples' Congress (NPC). 
  He was roughed up by unknown assailants at a Beijing hotel 
when he tried to circulate a letter to NPC delegates accusing 
the Hunan government of complicity in the case. "Yan's deep 
sincerity in trying to circulate the letter proves there is 
something wrong," the propaganda official said. 
  The official said the setting up of the team virtually 
ensured the provincial decision would be overturned. "The 
straws are in the wind. The central government is going to 
reach a new conclusion and arrest Zhao." 
  Reached by telephone in Loudi, Yan Yueming said he would not 
give up the fight until Zhao was punished. "There was no reason 
to detain me. As a local councillor, I must be given a fair and 
legal response for this injustice," he said. 
  Yan was promoted to head the Loudi district finance and 
trade 
commission in late 1993, but he said this was merely a cynical 
attempt by the provincial government to shut him up. "Even 
though my position has changed, I still feel the same way," he 
said. "I will continue to struggle." He said he had not yet 
been informed of the central government's decision to reopen the 
case. 
  "I had almost given up hope for a change in their attitude," 
he said. Yan indicated the replacement of the Hunan party 
secretary last October may have cleared the way for a 
reappraisal of the incident. 
  When eight Beijing party propaganda officials sent to look 
into the case visited the province last December, they were 
given a sympathetic reception by the province's newly-appointed 
party secretary, Wang Maolin. The former party secretary, Xiong 
Qingquan, who is thought to have supported Mayor Zhao, was 
stripped of his post and put into semiretirement as a 
vice-chairman of the provincial peoples' congress last October.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Jinfu (3076 6855 4395): "China's </F>
Anticorruption Work Is Gradually Institutionalized"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- China has gone all out 
to conduct anticorruption work since 1978, when China's 
procuratorial organs were restored and reorganized. Since then, 
700,000 corruption and bribery cases have been accepted and 
heard, of which, 400,000 have been filed for investigation and 
prosecution, and 8 billion yuan worth's embezzled money and 
goods have been recovered. From 1982 to 1993, seven cadres of 
provincial and ministerial levels, over 300 cadres of department 
and bureau levels, and over 7,000 cadres of county and section 
levels, who were guilty of corruption and bribery, were placed 
on file for investigation and prosecution by procuratorial 
organs throughout the country. 
  Since the convocation of the third plenary session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, China's anticorruption work has 
begun to be implemented in line with the legal system. The 
restored and reorganized procuratorial organs have actively 
conducted the work of dealing blows to economic irregularities, 
including the work of opposing corruption. Particularly since 
the CPC Central Committee adopted the decision of profoundly 
launching the anticorruption struggle in August 1993, 
procuratorial organs have given full play to their functional 
role to emphatically investigate and punish the corruption and 
bribery cases committed by working personnel of party and 
government organs, judicial departments, law-enforcing 
administrative departments, and economic management departments. 
Procuratorial organs have also concentrated their efforts on 
investigating and cracking a number of major and appalling 
cases, thus achieving remarkable results in the anticorruption 
work. From September 1993 to March 1994, procuratorial organs 
filed 22,220 corruption and bribery cases for investigation, of 
which, 9,948 cases involved an amount ranging from 10,000 yuan 
to 100,000 each, 789 cases involved an amount ranking from 
100,000 yuan to 1 million yuan each, and 37 cases involved over 
1 million yuan each. At the same time, 904 cadres at or above 
the county and section levels, who committed the crimes of 
corruption and bribery, were investigated and punished (of whom, 
71 were of department and bureau levels). A total of 13,019 
cadres guilty of corruption and bribery were brought to the 
people's courts for prosecution. 
  While launching the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial 
organs have established crime-reporting centers, perfected the 
crime-reporting system, and successfully created the effective 
method of mobilizing and depending on the masses to struggle 
against corruption and bribery during the new period of not 
carrying the mass movement. According to statistics, since the 
establishment of crime-reporting centers, the crimes reported by 
the masses have become the major source of the corruption and 
bribery cases filed by procuratorial organs for investigation. 
From 1988 to 1993, procuratorial organs throughout the country 
accepted a total of 750,000 clues for solving corruption and 
bribery cases. 
  During the anticorruption struggle, procuratorial organs 
have 
gradually given rise to a mechanism of opposing corruption and 
investigating corruption cases, in which higher levels are 
combined with lower levels and organizational operation is 
rapid, thus pushing the anticorruption work to the new path of 
regularized and modernized development. At present, 
procuratorial organs throughout the country have an 
anticorruption and investigation contingent of 38,000 people.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhai Qiyun (5049 0796 6663) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254): "A Group of 
Collectives and Individuals Advanced in Civil Affairs Work, 
Commended"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 16 May (XINHUA) -- The 10th national 
conference on civil affairs held by the State Council ended in 
Beijing today. State Councillor Li Guixian called on governments 
at all levels to pay full attention to the major significance of 
successfully carrying out civil affairs work, strengthen 
leadership over this work, closely combine the implementation of 
this conference's guidelines with the formulation and 
implementation of the local plans for "attaining the level of 
comparatively well-off," and the "87" plan for tackling the most 
difficult problems while supporting the poor areas, and enable 
civil affairs work to better serve the party's central task and 
the work of safeguarding social stability. 
  During the conference, delegates exchanged the experiences 
in 
civil affairs work of various localities and clearly defined 
future tasks. They held that the convocation of this conference 
was not only a practical guiding significance in civil affairs 
work but also of major significance in safeguarding social 
stability and promoting the work concerning the overall 
situation. 
  At the conference, 128 counties (cities, prefectures, 
banners), including Fengnan County in Hebei Province, and 211 
townships and towns (neighborhoods), including the Shibalidian 
Township in Chaoyang in Beijing Municipality, were respectively 
named advanced counties (cities, prefectures, banners) in civil 
affairs work and townships and towns (neighborhoods) outstanding 
in all aspects by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Today, the 
Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Personnel have 
also decided to confer the title of national advanced worker of 
the civil affairs department on 163 comrades, such as Han 
Shuzhen, and the title of national model worker of the civil 
affairs department on 37 comrades, including Liu Aizhen. Among 
the great number of advanced models from the civil affairs 
departments across the country, 12 outstanding delegates also 
received the award of the highest honor -- the oxen 
award--today, from the Ministry of Civil Affairs. 
  At the closing session, Li Guixian stressed: Civil affairs 
work is an important aspect in government work, having a direct 
bearing on social stability and on economic and social 
development, closely linked with the immediate interests of the 
broad masses of people, and having the strong characteristics of 
social endeavor and mass participation. He said: Always 
listening to the voices of the masses, caring for the immediate 
interests of the masses, and safeguarding and guaranteeing the 
basic living rights and interests of the masses of people, 
constitutes the fundamental purpose of our party and the 
government. Successfully carrying out civil affairs work is 
precisely the specific manifestation of this purpose and of the 
superiority of the socialist system. 
  Li Guixian held that for now and for some time to come, the 
priority in civil affairs work is to do a good job in social 
security work and building grass-roots organizations. He said: 
The social security system is an important support project of 
the socialist market economic structure, having a bearing on 
whether the reform of the economic structure can be smoothly 
carried out or not. All localities should pay great attention to 
it and realistically do their work well. The grass-roots 
political power and the grass-roots self-government 
organizations of the masses constitute the foundation of all 
fields of work. The civil affairs departments in all localities 
should actively coordinate with relevant departments to 
reshuffle and build the grass-roots organizations. 
  Li Guixian also called on the civil affairs departments in 
all localities to do a good job in administrative zoning, social 
management, marriage and funeral management, as well as the work 
of taking in the people or sending them back to their original 
places. 
  Doje Cering, minister of civil affairs, presided over 
today's 
closing session.

<F P=106> ["Regulations Governing the Examination of Cases by </F>
Discipline Inspection Organs of the Communist Party of China 
(adopted at the 65th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 
CPC Central Committee's Discipline Inspection Commission on 28 
January 1994)"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chapter I. 
General Principles 
  Article 1. Examination of cases of discipline violation 
within the CPC is an important task of the discipline inspection 
organs of the CPC and is the central link for strictly enforcing 
party discipline. With a view to standardizing and 
institutionalizing the examination of cases and improving 
quality and efficiency in handling cases, these regulations are 
formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
CPC's Constitution and in conjunction with practice in examining 
cases.

handling of cases, safeguarding the party's constitution and 
other party laws and regulations, strengthening party 
discipline, improving the party's work style, encouraging 
honesty, protecting reform and opening to the outside world, 
promoting economic development, and ensuring the smooth 
implementation of the party's basic line. 
  Article 3. Discipline inspection organs exercise their right 
to examine cases in accordance with the party constitution and 
these regulations free from interference from state organs, 
social organizations, and individuals. 
  Article 4. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs 
must uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts, and on 
the basis of facts and with party discipline as the criterion, 
they must see to it that the facts are clear, the evidence is 
indisputable, the nature of the offense is accurately described, 
the handling is appropriate, and the procedures are complete. 
  Article 5. In examining cases, the principle that all are 
equal before party discipline must be adhered to, and any party 
member and party organization must be examined according to 
these regulations if they violate party discipline. 
  Article 6. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs 
shall rely on party organizations at all levels, take the mass 
line, and improve coordination between themselves and other 
relevant departments. 
  Article 7. In examining cases, discipline inspection organs 
shall implement the principle of learning from past mistakes to 
avoid future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient in 
order to achieve the dual purposes of maintaining strict party 
discipline and educating the offender as well as other party 
members. 
  Article 8. In the course of examining a case, a discipline 
inspection organ shall effectively ensure that party members, 
including those who are being examined, exercise their rights 
bestowed on them by the party constitution. 
  Article 9. The examination of cases shall be conducted at 
different levels, with each level assuming its responsibilities. 
<H5>  Chapter II. Acceptance and Hearing of a Case and Initial </H5>
Verification 
  Article 10. Discipline inspection organs shall accept and 
hear the following listed cases of violation of discipline 
reported, filed, or discovered: 
  (1) Violations of discipline by a member of the party 
committee or discipline inspection commission of the same level; 
  (2) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre who is 
working in a locality or a department but is under the 
administration of a party committee at a higher level; 
  (3) Violations of discipline by a party member cadre under 
the administration of a party committee of the same level; 
  (4) Violations of discipline by a party organization at a 
lower level; 
  (5) Cases of violations of discipline in connection with 
other party members and party organizations assigned by the 
leadership of a higher level. 
  When necessary, discipline inspection organs may accept and 
hear a case of violations of discipline of a serious and typical 
nature involving a party member and party organization under the 
jurisdiction of a party committee at a lower level. 
  Article 11. After accepting a case of discipline violation 
involving a party member or a party organization, a discipline 
inspection organ shall, in line with the circumstances, decide 
whether initial verification is necessary. If initial 
verification is necessary, it shall promptly send personnel to 
do the job; when necessary, it may entrust a discipline 
inspection organ at a lower level to obtain the initial 
verification. 
  Article 12. The purpose of obtaining initial verification is 
to find out whether the main complaints exist and whether there 
is evidence for prosecuting the case. 
  Article 13. In obtaining initial verification, the methods 
contained in (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (8) of Article 28 of 
these regulations may be adopted to collect evidence. 
  Article 14. Personnel participating in the initial 
verification shall write reports about their findings upon 
completing the initial verification, and discipline inspection 
organs shall handle relevant cases according to the situation: 
  (1) Where an issue has not been truthfully reflected, the 
unit and party organization to which the person involved belongs 
shall be briefed about the situation, and when necessary, the 
person involved will also be briefed and to a certain extent, 
given explanations to clarify things; 
  (2) Where facts point to a violation of discipline of a less 
serious nature which does not require an investigation to affix 
responsibility for party discipline, suggestions shall be made 
to the relevant party organizations to handle the case properly; 
and 
  (3) Where facts actually point to a violation of discipline 
which then requires an investigation to affix responsibility for 
party discipline, the case shall be placed on file for 
investigation and prosecution. 
  Article 15. The time limit for conducting an initial 
verification is two months, and this can be extended another 
month if necessary. If initial verification cannot be completed 
within the extended period due to the seriousness and complexity 
of the case, the time limit can be suitably extended again upon 
approval. 
<H5>  Chapter III. Placing a Case on File for Investigation and </H5>
Prosecution 
  Article 16. A party member or party organization which has 
been reported to the authorities, which faces accusation, and 
which has been revealed for violating discipline, and whose 
actions merit investigation to affix responsibility for party 
discipline after it has been proved, through initial 
verification, that discipline is violated will go through the 
formalities -- conducted within the limits of authority -- of 
having its case placed on file for investigation and prosecution. 
  Article 17. Cases of discipline violations by party members 
will be placed on separate files for investigation and 
prosecution according to the ranks of party members. 
  (1) The Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall seek 
approval from the party Central Committee to place on file for 
investigation and prosecution cases involving party discipline 
violations by party Central Committee members or members of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission. 
  (2) Cases involving party discipline violations by standing 
committee members of party committees and discipline inspection 
commissions at all levels below the party Central Committee 
(secretaries and deputy secretaries in grass-roots party 
committees and discipline inspection commissions), and by party 
committee members who hold positions equivalent to party 
committee standing committee members, shall be placed on file 
for investigation and prosecution if so decided by discipline 
inspection commissions immediately above the levels of the 
relevant committees or commissions. These discipline inspection 
commissions shall seek the opinions of party committees at 
corresponding levels before making any decisions to place the 
cases on file for investigation and prosecution. Party 
discipline violations by other committee and commission members 
shall be reported by discipline inspection commissions of the 
same levels to party committees of equivalent levels, which will 
give approval to place the cases on file for investigation and 
prosecution. 
  (3) Other party members who are cadres and who violate 
party discipline will be handled according to the limits of 
authority over the management of cadres. Corresponding 
discipline inspection commissions, or discipline inspection work 
committees or organs, shall decide whether or not to place the 
cases on file for investigation and prosecution, and they shall 
solicit opinions from party committees, or party work committees 
or organs, of the same levels before making their decisions. In 
the absence of discipline inspection commissions, or discipline 
inspection work committees or organs, corresponding party 
committees, or party work committees or organs, shall decide on 
whether or not to put the cases on file for investigation and 
prosecution. 
  (4) Grass-roots discipline inspection commissions shall 
decide whether or not to place on file for investigation and 
prosecution cases involving party discipline violation by party 
members who are not cadres. 
  Article 18. Unless stipulated otherwise, local discipline 
inspection organs shall, in general, decide whether or not to 
place on file for investigation and prosecution any cases of 
party discipline violation by party members who are cadres at 
competent departments and who fall under the party's limits of 
authority for appointments and removals of local personnel and 
cadres. 
  If local discipline inspection organizations believe that it 
is more appropriate for discipline inspection organs of 
competent departments to place a case on file for investigation 
and prosecution, the former may let the latter do so after 
consulting with them. Discipline violation cases which, 
according to stipulations, shall be handled by discipline 
inspection organs of competent departments may also be placed on 
file for investigation and prosecution by local discipline 
inspection organizations after consultations. 
  Article 19. Serious party discipline violations by party 
organizations of certain levels shall be reported by discipline 
inspection organizations immediately above the relevant levels 
of the party organizations to party committees at levels 
equivalent to the discipline inspection organizations', and 
permission shall be sought from the party committees to place 
the case on file for inspection and prosecution. Discipline 
inspection commissions at levels immediately above the 
aforementioned discipline inspection organizations' may also 
directly make decisions to place the case on file for 
investigation and prosecution after soliciting opinions from 
party committees of equivalent levels. 
  Article 20. When necessary, discipline inspection organs of 
higher levels may make direct decisions to place major 
discipline violation cases on file for investigation and 
prosecution, even when these cases should be filed by discipline 
inspection organs of lower levels. 
  Article 21. Discipline inspection organs of higher levels 
may instruct discipline inspection organs of lower levels to 
place discipline violation cases on file for investigation and 
prosecution if they discover that the latter are responsible for 
putting these cases on file. 
  Article 22. When a case has to be put on file for 
investigation and prosecution, reports seeking approval for 
filing shall be written, with materials from relevant 
accusations and reports about the initial verification appended 
to them. The reports shall be submitted for examination and 
approved in line with the limits of authority for approving the 
filing. 
  The time limit for examining a report asking for permission 
to put a case on file for investigation and prosecution shall 
not exceed one month. 
  Discipline inspection organizations shall inform 
organization 
departments of party committees at the same levels about cases 
which have been approved for filing. 
  Chapter IV. Investigation 
  Article 23. The organ that places a case on file for further 
action shall organize an investigation team according to the 
circumstances surrounding that case. 
  Article 24. The investigation team should familiarize itself 
with the circumstances surrounding that case, find out about 
policies and provisions related to it, draw up an investigation 
plan based on its study, and convey the decision to pursue the 
case to the party organization of the unit to which the person 
under investigation belongs. 
  The party organization in the unit to which the person being 
investigated belongs should actively support the handling of the 
case and strengthen the education of the investigated person as 
well as people in the know. It must not, without the prior 
consent of the organ pursuing the case or the investigation 
team, give the person being investigated approval to leave our 
territory, go abroad, or go on a business trip, and not 
transfer, promote, or give awards to the investigated person. 
  Article 25. Under normal circumstances, the investigation 
team shall begin its investigation with a talk with the person 
being investigated that is held jointly with the party 
organization in the unit to which the person being investigated 
belongs. At the talk, the person being investigated shall be 
told the decision to place the case on file for further action 
and the discipline to be taken, and the person should be 
requested to take a correct attitude toward the organized 
investigation. During the investigation, the investigation team 
shall listen earnestly to the investigated person's 
representations and opinions and conduct proper ideological work 
and education. 
  Article 26. Where the investigation team believes that a 
cadre with party membership under investigation has committed 
serious mistakes, is no longer fit for his or her current 
position, or will hinder the investigation, it may propose 
suspending the investigated person from office for examination. 
A decision to suspend the investigated person from party office 
for examination shall be made by a party committee that has 
earlier approved the filing of the case for further action, or 
be made, after consultations with the party committee at the 
same level, by a discipline inspection organ that has filed the 
case directly. 
  Article 27. All facts proving the authenticity of the case 
shall be deemed to be evidence. Evidence shall include material 
evidence, documentary evidence, witnesses' testimony, injured 
parties' representations, the investigated person's 
representations, audio and video material, spot notes, 
conclusions of appraisals, and notes on surveys and examinations. 
  Evidence shall be verified as genuine before it can be used 
as a basis for reaching conclusion on the case. 
  Article 28. All organizations and individuals with knowledge 
about circumstances concerning the case are obliged to provide 
evidence. The investigation team has the right to take the 
following measures in accordance with stipulated procedures to 
carry out an investigation and to gather evidence; the 
organizations and individuals concerned must provide evidence 
accurately and not decline to do so or create obstructions. 
  (1) To look up and duplicate documents, information, account 
books, bills, minutes of meetings, work notes, and other 
documentary matters; 
  (2) To demand that the organizations concerned provide 
documents, information, and other paper documents, and give 
other essential illustrations; 
  (3) To demand that the personnel concerned give explanations 
at a stipulated time and place on issues related to the case; 
  (4) To make audio or video recordings or take photographs of 
personnel and matters related to the case where necessary; 
  (5) To request that relevant specialized organizations or 
personnel appraise specialized issues related to the case and 
draw conclusions; 
  (6) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a 
discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, hold 
in temporary custody or seal up documents, information, account 
books, bills, articles, and illegal incomes that could serve to 
prove an act of discipline violation; 
  (7) To, upon approval by the responsible person of a 
discipline inspection organ at or above the county level, check 
the investigated party's deposits in banks or other financial 
institutions and notify the banks or financial institutions 
concerned to suspend payment from the accounts in question; 
  (8) To gather all other evidence that could serve to prove 
the authenticity of the case. 
  Article 29. In investigations and in collecting evidence, 
it is necessary to ensure the following points: 
  (1) In collecting material and written evidence, every 
effort 
should be made to get the actual items or the originals; if it 
is impossible to get the actual items or the originals, 
photographs or copies may be used, but their custodians or their 
origin should be indicated; and written evidence should bear the 
custodian's signature or stamp; 
  (2) Witnesses should be told about their responsibility, and 
one witness should produce one copy of testimony, which may 
either be written by the witness himself or written by the 
investigator and confirmed by the witness; all testimonies 
should contain information on the witness's identity and the 
time of testifying and bear the witness's signature or stamp; if 
the witness wants to change a part of or the entire testimony, 
he may produce a new testimony, but he must indicate the reason 
for the change, and the original testimony shall not be returned 
to him; a witness shall be interviewed by at least two 
investigators at the same time; the provisions of this item are 
applicable to the collection of statements by victims and

evidence before they are reaffirmed by investigators. 
  Article 30. Public security, judicial, and other 
law-enforcement departments should actively cooperate if they 
are required to provide relevant materials for the investigation 
of discipline violation cases.

investigated person's attitude toward the investigation, and 
recommended actions. During the investigation, any negation of 
questions should be clearly explained. Questions which are hard 
to confirm should be reported according to the facts. The 
investigation report shall be signed by all members of the 
investigating team. 
  If members of the investigating team have a relatively big 
difference over the nature of the wrongdoing, the responsibility 
of the persons involved, and the recommended actions, and if 
they cannot reach a consensus after discussion, the 
investigation report should be written according to the opinion 
of the head of the investigating team, and the difference should

  The investigating team should keep the party organization of 
the investigated person's unit informed of the main contents of 
the investigation report and seek its comments. 
  Article 35. An informant or witness should be investigated 
and blamed for creating trumped-up charges or false testimony or

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Do a Good Job of Holding Leading </F>
Cadres' Meetings on Honesty and Self-Discipline"] 
  [Text] After the second session of the CPC Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission set the "five-point 
regulations" on the honesty and self-discipline of party and 
government leading cadres at and above the county (section) 
level, the third session of the CPC Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission this year laid down five new regulations 
according to the instructions of the central leadership on 
leading cadres' use of cars, housing, internal reception, 
arrangements of wedding and funeral ceremonies, and borrowing 
and using public money and materials. The opinion of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission on the concrete 
implementation of the regulations has also been made public. 
Party and government organs at and above the county level 
throughout the country are actively making preparations 
according to the requirements of the central leadership for 
holding special democratic-life meetings to examine the leading 
cadres' behavior according to the regulations. Some localities 
have already held such meetings. 
  It is of great importance to conscientiously rather than 
perfunctorily hold such special democratic-life meetings. Only 
when leading cadres at all levels set a good example in keeping 
themselves honest and properly exercise self-discipline can they 
play an exemplary role among the vast number of cadres in 
carrying forward the party's fine style, resisting the corrosive 
influence of the decadent ideology and life-style of the 
exploiting classes, gain the initiative in the anticorruption 
struggle, promote the improvement of the party style based on 
honesty, and better serve the purposes of reform, development, 
and stability. Through these special democratic-life meetings 
on promoting honesty and self-discipline, the leading cadres 
will more clearly understand the behavior norms under the new 
situation. This gives expression to the party's constant 
principle for setting strict demands on leading cadres. This is 
also an opportunity to issue warnings [da zhao hu 2092 2156 
0729] and conduct education and demonstrates the party's 
profound loving care for the cadres. 
  The key to honesty and self-discipline lies in one's 
consciousness. All leading cadres should further enhance the 
sense of self-discipline, constantly set strict demands for 
themselves, constantly seek truth from facts, and constantly 
carry out serious criticism and self-criticism. At the special 
democratic-life meetings, they should take the initiative in 
examining all problems and should not try to dodge the serious 
problems and only mention the minor ones. They should not try 
to sidestep any problems. If a problem is related to a 
collective decision, the responsibility should still be properly 
affixed so that a lesson can be learned. It is necessary to 
overcome and prevent the unhealthy trend of "only mentioning 
minor problems in a general way or citing some obvious problems 
without exposing serious and covert problems" among leading 
cadres in some localities. The individuals concerned should 
take the initiative in actually correcting the exposed problems 
in the course of self-examination. Self-examination should be 
thorough; any ill-gotten money and materials should be returned 
resolutely; and mistakes should be corrected to a degree that 
satisfies the organizations and the masses and also eases one's 
own conscience. Serious action must be taken to solve problems 
that have not been solved and corrected since they were exposed 
in last year's self- examination, and we must also deal with 
some problems that those involved failed to examine and correct 
conscientiously, a situation about which the masses are very 
discontented. 
  In order to ensure the leading's cadres' honesty and 
self-discipline and to prompt them to make conscientious 
self-examination and self-correction, we must also strengthen 
supervision and inspection by giving play to the external 
forces. That is, self- discipline should be combined with other 
people's supervision. Play should be given to the supervisory 
role of the party organizations at all levels and the masses. 
Before the special democratic-life meetings are held, the party 
organizations should first discover the problems in the 
implementation of the five-point regulations, seriously listen 
to complaints and criticisms made by ordinary cadres and the 
masses, and relay their findings to the leading cadres 
concerned. The party organizations at the upper level should 
send cadres to attend the meetings, thus giving more effective 
guidance and carrying out more effective supervision. The 
criticisms and self-criticisms made at the meetings should 
respond to the complaints made by the masses. The conditions of 
self-examination and self-correction should be made public in a 
certain scope after the meetings so that the leading cadres can 
be further subject to mass supervision. The party organizations 
should help those comrades who are involved in many problems and 
who lack the will to correct their behavior and should prompt 
them to change their attitude toward self-examination and 
self-correction. Those who do not seriously conduct 
self-examination and self-correction, do not face their own 
problems squarely, and thus arouse strong discontent among the 
masses should be ordered to repeat the process of 
self-examination and self-correction. Party and administrative 
discipline actions should be taken against those who refuse to 
criticize their mistakes and mend their ways after being found 
to violate the regulations in order to safeguard the solemnity 
of discipline, to guarantee the quality of the special 
democratic-life meetings, and to prevent the superficiality of 
such meetings. 
  Under the leadership of the party central body and the State 
Council, the nationwide anticorruption struggle is developing in 
depth. Party leading cadres at all levels must grasp this 
opportunity to enhance the sense of performing official duties 
honestly through such effective activities as holding special 
democratic-life meetings and must set a good example for the 
vast number of ordinary cadres with their honest behavior and 
spirit of self discipline.

  [Text] The prospect of labour unrest in China has 
increased because governments and banks in many cities have run 
out of money to pay workers, some of whom are owed several 
months' salary. It had been standing orders to pay strikers' 
wage demands in state-owned factories, but in several cities 
banks and administrations have refused to do so. 
  Beijing sources said yesterday the State Council was taken 
aback by their refusal. The sources said incidents of 
industrial unrest were occurring once or twice a week in 
depressed sectors, such as coal and textiles, in Hubei, Hunan, 
Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces. "To prevent the strikes 
and protests from developing into political incidents, Beijing 
has ordered lower-level governments to satisfy the demands of 
workers whenever possible," an industrial source said. 
"However, numerous local leaders have refused to pay, either 
because they have no money or they think the practice, which 
often involves printing money, would exacerbate inflation." 
  The source said in most cases Beijing had been able to 
confine strikes by using a carrot-and-stick approach a 
combination of the pay-up policy and the deployment of police to 
prevent workers from spreading their action to other factories. 
But it is understood the State Council is worried about the 
labour situation worsening in the wake of cities refusing to 
hand out money to pacify strikers. 
  At the same time, the authorities are being confronted with 
protests by civil servants in rural areas, many of whom are paid 
only three or four times a year. Chinese sources said more than 
a dozen counties in Hunan could only pay civil servants 
irregularly, leading to poor morale and go-slow protests.

<F P=106> [By reporter Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions held a forum here today to discuss publishing "Deng 
Xiaoping's Works on the Working Class and Trade Unions." It 
also issued a circular on studying the works, in which it urged 
the trade unions at all levels to integrate the study of the 
works with that of Volume 3 of Deng Xiaoping's Selected 
Works. They should earnestly study and read the original 
works by bearing in mind the reality of trade union work, 
grasping the essence of the works, and applying the scientific 
theories to arm themselves, and directing their practice so as 
to bring about prosperous development in trade union work and 
the workers' movement in the new historic period. 
  Attending the forum were Wei Jianxing, Yu Qiuli, several 
scores of cadres from the Federation, and the representatives of 
staff members and workers. Speaking at the forum were Yu Qiuli; 
Zhang Dinghua, vice president of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions and first secretary of the Federation's 
Secretariat; Gu Dachun, former vice president of the Federation; 
Yang Chungui, vice president and professor of the party school 
under the CPC Central Committee; and Liu Li, leader of the 
operation group of the western district international affairs 
bureau under the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Bureau. 
They pointed out: In directing the grand cause of socialist 
modernizations, reform, and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
has always attached great importance on the working class and 
trade union work. His important expositions on a series of 
issues, such as relying on the working class wholeheartedly and 
bringing into full play the role of trade unions, represent his 
scientific summarization on China's workers' movement and trade 
union work. They also represent the most powerful ideological 
weapon to bring about the sound development of the workers' 
movement and trade union work in China and constitute the 
important component of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. They contended: Earnestly studying 
and deeply exploring Comrade Deng Xiaoping's ideology on the 
working class and trade unions is of great, practical, and 
far-reaching importance to deeply understanding the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to implementing 
in an overall way the party's basic line and its fundamentally 
guiding principle of relying on the working class 
wholeheartedly; to actively exploring a new way for the trade 
union work of socialism with Chinese characteristics; to 
vigorously creating a new situation in trade union work; to 
uniting with and mobilizing hundreds of millions of staff 
members and workers to closely rally round the CPC Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core; and to uniting 
as one and waging arduous struggles so as to win an important 
and great victory in the socialist cause with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  In editing the publication of "Deng Xiaoping's Works on the 
Working Class and Trade Unions," the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions has selected 55 works of Comrade Deng Xiaoping with 
regard to the expositions made by him on the working class and 
trade unions during the various periods. Of these works, those 
that first became available to the public include "The Outline 
of His Report Made at the Urban Work Conference Sponsored by the 
Southwest Bureau" and "The Issue on the Correct Relationship 
Between the Party and Mass Communities."

<F P=106> [By Gao Anming: "Ending Residence Registration"] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese Government is expected to scrap the 
36-year-old residence registration system next month so farmers 
can live legally in small cities. 
  Han Jun, a researcher with the Institute of Rural 
Development 
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the plan will 
open the gates of cities at and below the county level to 
peasants who have been denied permanent urban residence since 
the late 1950s. 
  China had 517 official cities by the end of 1992, 323 at the 
county level. Above the county level were 191 prefectural level 
cities and three municipalities. There were a total of 2,171 
counties. 
  Han, who has been widely quoted in the Chinese press 
recently 
for his study of the household registration system, welcomed the 
scheduled move as a breakthrough. 
  By the end of 1992, 78 per cent of the population, or 919 
million Chinese citizens, were classified as rural residents. 
  Frustrated by low income from farming and few job 
opportunities due to the dearth of arable land, some 50 to 60 
million farmers have left their hometowns. At least half have 
moved into cities despite the fact they have no legal status 
there. 
  This has been possible because urban reforms have 
increasingly commercialized employment, the supply of housing, 
food and other basic commodities, as well as welfare and social 
securities, which were distributed administratively in the past 
under the traditional command economy. 
  The old system is no longer effective in holding back the 
city-bound population flow following the disintegration of 
"people's communes" and the compulsory government procurement of 
all farm products. 
  Household registration has become detrimental to further 
economic development, Han said in an interview with China Daily. 
  The scholar described farmers who have entered the cities as 
"amphibians." 
  Not acknowledged by urban authorities as permanent 
residents, 
they are not permitted to take some city jobs. So to be safe, 
they hold on to their contracted land at home, though they never 
actually cultivate it. 
  A rural labourer is entitled to 0.31 hectares of land in the 
countryside. Even with basic equipment, they can complete a 
year's worth of farm work in a few months. This explains why 
many have the time to look for jobs in cities. 
  However, as cities close their doors to rural workers, most 
surplus rural labour is forced to seek jobs in the countryside 
-- explaining why 80 per cent of China's rural non-agricultural 
businesses are located in villages, whereas a mere 1 per cent 
are in county seats and cities. 
  Scattered companies have caused inefficiency in land use and 
infrastructure construction, difficulties in pollution treatment 
and sluggish development of the tertiary industry. 
  The permanent residence system has also caused social 
problems, Han said. 
  Transient rural labourers face problems in registering for 
marriage, sending children to nurseries and schools, looking for 
housing and buying social security. 
  They are also left in an administrative vacuum as they are 
no 
longer governed by the authorities of their hometowns. City 
governments, on the other hand, do not regulate them either 
because farmers do not have residence. As a result, the number 
of crimes has risen sharply among transient workers in cities. 
The percentage of criminal offences committed by transients has 
nearly doubled to 41 per cent from 1990 to 1993 in Beijing. In 
Shenzhen, cases involving transients jumped from 26 per cent of 
total criminal cases in 1980 to 93 per cent last year. 
  Han said the reform will break the division between rural 
and 
urban residents and remove the various privileges those in the 
city get so the two groups may be placed on a more equal footing. 
  Answering worries among urbanites, Han said the reform 
should 
not hurt them much if it is carried out step by step. 
  Farmers should not flood cities if the restrictions are 
lifted, he said, as has been the case in Brazil, Mexico and 
India. In Brazil, for example, most farmers have lost their 
land to large landlords, who carry out farming with modern 
machines. Farmers thus flock to cities to make a living. 
  In China, however, each farmer is entitled to a piece of 
land 
of largely the same size. Most of them would probably remain on 
the land. 
  The expected commercialization of welfare and social 
security 
following the end of the residence system also would increase 
the cost of moving to cities. 
  Han said the reform would invariably intensify employment 
competition between urbanites and rural workers and increase 
unemployment in some areas. But this should not be an excuse to 
keep the mandatory registration system. Latest statistics show 
that there are many more unemployed people in the countryside 
than in cities. 
  Han noted that most transient labourers take up blue-collar 
jobs shunned by their urban counterparts, such as selling 
vegetables, making clothes and building houses. They are 
helping city residents more than seizing opportunities from 
them, and have created as many new jobs as they have taken, Han 
said. 
  The rural population's lower educational standards also hurt 
them in their job hunting efforts in the city. 
  To minimize the risks of the reform, the government should 
establish a national market to regulate the labour flow and let 
farmers know about the opportunities and risks in cities. 
  In cities, the hidden subsidies employees receive in medical 
care and housing should be substituted with cash wages. At the 
same time, a socialized welfalre and securities system open to 
all residents should be introduced so that urban residence cards 
do not mean additional benefits. 
  Han said the reform should begin in small cities because 
most 
privileges for city residents there have already been 
eliminated, thus making the transition easier. 
  People who apply for permanent urban residence would be 
required to transfer their land to others so that those still in 
the countryside could be given larger plots. 
  New city recruits would no longer enjoy previous privileges, 
and the government would encourage farmers to pool funds to 
build cities of their own, Han said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Siyang (0491 1835 2254)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A recent international 
seminar on administrative reform and management revealed that 
the three tasks of determining the respective functions, 
internal setup, and staff size of the various departments under 
the State Council had been achieved. One after another, the 
various departments are beginning to operate with their new 
functions and organizations. The implementation of local 
institutional reform has also been kicked off on a full scale, 
with a dozen or so provinces and autonomous regions such as 
Liaoning, Jilin, Anhui, Shandong, and Guangdong having embarked 
on their institutional reform programs ahead of schedule. 
  To further deepen administrative reform, the General Office 
of the Central Organization Committee [COC] recently sponsored 
an international seminar on administrative reform and management 
in Beijing. Experts, scholars, and government officials from 
Thailand, Hong Kong, France, the United States, Britain, India, 
Australia, and China attended the seminar. 
  Zhang Zhijian, deputy director of the COC General Office and 
vice minister of personnel, told the meeting that over recent 
years, China has concentrated on changes in various social and 
economic fields to unfold -- from top to bottom -- a round of 
reforms in the administrative system and in institutions, to 
meet the needs of building a socialist market economic system. 
These reforms yielded first fruits in changing the functions of 
government institutions, smoothing working relations, 
streamlining organizations and personnel, and improving 
efficiency, to bring about a major step forward in shaping a new 
administrative and management system suited to the socialist 
market economy. 
  According to Zhang Zhijian, in the process of reforming the 
administrative system and institutions, China met with some 
protruding problems in areas such as building a macroeconomic 
regulation and control system and making administrative rules. 
He said: This international seminar will have a very important 
affect on further summing up the current practice of reform, 
better drawing on useful ancient and modern experiences at home 
and abroad, and vigorously advancing the next step of 
administrative reform. 
  Gu Jiaqi [7357 1367 7784], deputy director of the COC 
General 
Office, gave a special speech to the seminar on the planning and 
implementation of administrative reform by the Chinese 
Government. 
  During the three-day seminar, participating centered on 
administrative reform by the governments of various countries, 
the comparison of administrative reform strategies with 
international experience, relationships between central and 
local governments, reform of public administration, and reform 
of government legislation, and carried out in-depth discussions 
on them. The seminar had the support and cooperation of the UN 
Development and Planning Agency.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755): "State Councillor </F>
Chen Junsheng Urges Various Localities To Be Based on Serious 
Flood Control and To Be Well Prepared for Serious Disaster 
Control"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Chen Junsheng, 
Councillor of the State Council and head of the State Flood 
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, emphatically pointed 
out today: General demands for flood control and drought relief 
this year are as follows: We should be based on conducting the 
work of serious flood control and serious drought relief. 
Efforts should be made to take a two-handed approach toward 
flood control and drought relief, to make necessary preparations 
for preventing serious disasters, to ensure the safety of the 
people's lives and property, and to reduce the losses caused by 
flooding and drought as much as possible. In conducting flood 
control, we should regard the work of reducing the casualties of 
personnel in the operation as a prominent task. 
  Niu Maosheng, minister of water resources, delivered a 
speech on introducing the situation at the first plenary session 
of 1944 sponsored by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief 
Headquarters today, in which he said: Although the action taken 
by various localities for the preparatory work of flood control 
this year has been relatively satisfactory and the relevant 
departments under the State Council have earnestly made 
preparations for flood control in line with the duties assigned 
by the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, we 
are still facing a severe situation in the flood control work 
this year because the standards of flood control work set for 
large rivers and by urban areas are generally on the low side; 
difficulties in applying the areas to relieving or blocking the 
flooding flows are large; measures to allocate the operation of 
flood control are backward; institutions in some localities in 
charge of flood control and drought relief are not sound; funds 
for flood control and drought relief are short; and the 
term-shift changes of personnel in charge of commanding the 
operation of flood control and drought relief are large, which 
have caused the large number of new hands who lack the 
experience of commanding and allocating the operation in the 
work. Therefore, it is necessary for us to make greater efforts 
in this regard. 
  During the plenary session Chen Junsheng urged various 
localities and the state departments concerned not only to 
ensure the safety of large rivers and lakes during the flooding 
period but also to attach great importance on the flood disaster 
along medium-sized and small rivers and streams, around the 
medium-sized and small reservoirs and towns, along the main 
traffic lines, and around the important industrial and mining 
enterprises; as well as on the mountainous disasters of torrents 
and landslide caused by the tropical storm. It is imperative to 
accelerate the formulation of fore-plans for serious flood 
control and to enforce the responsibility system with the duties 
undertaken by the administrative leaders as the core. By no 
means should we allow the recurrence of vicious incidents. 
Various localities should establish or improve the organs in 
charge of flood control and drought relief, increase the funds 
for these purposes, and upgrade the capability of personnel at 
all levels in carrying out flood control and drought relief. 
Various departments concerned should realistically perform the 
duties and obligation imposed on them for flood control and 
drought relief and follow the spirit of safeguarding the whole 
situation to support the work of flood control and drought 
relief. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: In order to realistically do a 
good job in the work of flood control and drought relief this 
year, the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters 
recently organized six inspection groups of flood control to 
carry out inspection prior to the flooding period. These groups 
led by the head or deputy heads of the state headquarters 
carried out inspections among Chang Jiang, Huang He, Hai He, 
Huai He, and Taihu Lake, as well as among the key cities that 
are chiefly assuming the work of flood control and among the 
mountainous areas that are prone to more disasters. They also 
conducted jointly with the local people's governments the 
official work on the spot and dealt with the existing major 
problems in a timely manner. 
  Chen Junsheng emphatically said: Currently, the flooding 
period has come. Some provinces in south China have prevailed 
flood and disaster situations in succession. Governments at all 
levels should attach great importance on them and realistically 
enhance their leadership over the work. Departments at all 
levels in charge of flood control should go into action 
immediately, take up the work that they should do, fulfill their 
duties, and be ready to meet every possible flood or drought 
disaster at all times.

<F P=106> [By Zhao Shulan (6392 3219 5695): "Ending Deficits of Some </F>
State-Owned Enterprises Is the Emphasis of the Current 
Enterprise Reform"] 
  [Text] From 27 to 29 April, Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, traveled to Handan and Xingtai 
cities to hold forums of the local party and government 
principal leaders and enterprise plant leaders and managers, and 
offered important ideas. 
  Xu Yongyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Li Zhanshu, member of the standing committee of 
the provincial party committee and secretary general of the 
provincial party committee, attended the forums. 
<H5>  Ending Deficits and Increasing Profits of Some Large and </H5>
Medium- Sized State-Owned Enterprises Is One of the Emphases of 
the Current Deepening of Reform 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: At present, one of the important 
tasks facing the party committees and governments at all levels 
is to seize the opportunity, concentrate energy, and accelerate 
the progress of enterprise reform. Through deepening reform, we 
should strive to help some state-owned deficit-incurring 
enterprises or enterprises running at half capacity or brought 
to a standstill end deficits and increase profits and enable 
them to free themselves from a difficult position; through 
changing operational mechanism, we should make enterprises link 
with the track of the market economy and to enter the orbit of a 
well-rounded cycle. 
  Solving the problems of money-losing enterprises, 
particularly the problems of the state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises running in the red, is the emphasis of 
the current deepening of reform. It has a bearing not only on 
guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets but 
also on stabilizing the basic contingents of the state. 
Invigorating state-owned enterprises is the key of the 
transition from the planned economy into the market economy. 
Enterprises have played a leading role in the play of the 
market economy. If enterprises fail to enter the market, this 
play cannot be staged. Therefore, regardless of speaking from 
the angle of reform or from the angle of development, reform of 
the state-owned enterprises is very important, and is the key 
and priority of the establishment of the market economic new 
structure. 
  All localities across the province have actively explored 
ways to deepen enterprise reform and solve the issue of helping 
enterprises end deficits and increase profits. Handan city has 
proposed that the key to invigorating enterprises is to have 
"good plant directors, good products, and good mechanisms." 
Xingtai city has adopted the measures of "reforming, helping, 
readjusting, and stimulating" money-losing enterprises. These 
good methods should be upheld continuously. However, generally 
speaking, we have failed to grasp this work forcefully. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Eliminate Three Ideological Obstacles </H5>
While Deepening Enterprises Running in the Red 
  Cheng Weigao said: Some of our leading cadres still have 
ideological obstacles of varying degrees in deepening reform of 
enterprises running in the red. First, some held that the 
increase in the enterprise deficit range is a general 
phenomenon. They never felt anxious, and they lacked a sense of 
urgency; second, regarding the problem of deficits, they usually 
found reasons of deficits objectively and seldom found reasons 
from enterprises themselves; third, they simply applied the 
measures for development to increasing input and starting new 
projects, and held that it has big risks and great difficulties 
if they rely on reform to invigorate the existing enterprises. 
Therefore, they failed to pay a high degree of attention to the 
issue of enterprise reform and to exert sufficient efforts to it. 
  We must clearly understand that in maintaining the mainstay 
status of state-owned sector of the economy in the course of 
developing the socialist market economy, on the one hand, the 
state must increase input and carry out some good projects, and 
on the other hand, the value of state-owned assets must be 
guaranteed and must increase. Only thus, can we guarantee the 
unceasing expansion of the state-owned sector of the economy. 
The deficits of state- owned enterprises are the main reasons 
for the losses of state-owned assets. Successfully ending the 
deficits of state-owned enterprises and helping them increase 
profits is an important aspect of guaranteeing the state-owned 
assets to maintain and increase the value and to further develop 
the productive forces. Therefore, we must pay great attention 
to the reform of state-owned enterprises and helping them end 
deficits and increase profits. 
  We Must Be Good at Seizing the Opportunity and Never 
Lose the Current Favorable Opportunity of the In-Depth Reform 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: It is true that the favorable 
conditions are the opportunities and difficulties and the 
problems are also opportunities. Grasping the difficulties and 
problems while conducting reform is also a way to seize the 
opportunity. At present, deficits of enterprises have 
increased. Although there are reasons of one sort or another, 
generally speaking, this has precisely exposed the 
contradictions of enterprises of incompatibility with the market 
economy and the fact that their ideological concepts, 
operational mechanism, operational strategy, and management 
policymaking are incompatible with the technological progress 
and enterprise management and with the impact caused by the 
unceasingly changeable market situation. This has also 
negatively showed that enterprises must carry out reform. These 
contradictions and difficulties have made the urgency and 
necessity of enterprise reform more striking. The pains brought 
by enterprise deficits have urged cadres and staff members to 
enhance their ability to withstand the strain of reform and 
provided a favorable ideological foundation for enterprise 
reform. So, we can say that enterprises may also have the 
opportunity of reform even when they meet with difficulties. We 
should seize the opportunity brought by difficulties and 
extricate ourselves from a difficult position by deepening 
reform, changing mechanisms, and overcoming difficulties. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Conscientiously Conduct Investigation and </H5>
Study and Formulate Plans for Deepening Reform, Changing 
Mechanism, Ending Deficits, and Increasing Profits 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: Leaders at all levels should go 
deep to the money-losing enterprises to clearly understand their 
degree of deficits and reasons for the deficits one by one, and 
then, formulate reform measures and methods for grasping the 
major contradictions and solving problems according to the 
merits of different cases. Some enterprises should reselect 
responsible persons and do a good job in selecting and employing 
trained personnel by introducing the competitive mechanisms; 
some enterprise deficits are caused by the problems of products 
and technological transformation which must be solved by 
adopting various methods, such as introducing technology and 
developing internal cooperation, updating and upgrading 
products, and transforming equipment and technology; some are 
caused by ineffective reform of the international management 
system which must be resolved by intensifying the degree of 
internal reforms and exerting efforts to grasp reform of the 
personnel, labor, and wage distribution systems in enterprises. 
Some enterprises whose fixed assets cannot pay off their debts 
and have no hope of ending deficits should be ordered to merge 
with other enterprises, lease out, or turn into state-owned but 
people-run enterprises if necessary. A small number of such 
enterprises should declare bankruptcy. In short, each and every 
money-losing enterprise should do a good job in formulating its 
own reform plan aimed at ending deficits and increasing profits. 
It is necessary to use two or three years to gradually 
revitalize money- losing enterprises. 
<H5>  Accelerating Reform on the Selection and Management of </H5>
Enterprise Cadres Is the Precondition for Deepening Enterprise 
Reform 
  Cheng Weigao believed that to deepen enterprise reform, 
first 
of all, we must further deepen reform on the selection and 
management of enterprise cadres. It is necessary to adopt the 
mechanism which combines incentives with restraints, select the 
superior and eliminate the inferior through competition, enable 
a great batch of outstanding entrepreneurs to show up, and 
eliminate managers and plant directors who are incompetent to 
improve the backward enterprises. The key to successfully 
running an enterprise is to have a good manager or plant 
director. With a good manager and plant director, an enterprise 
may produce products and introduce technology and funds even 
though it does not have any. On the contrary, an enterprise 
cannot run well without a bright and competent plant director 
even though it has all given conditions. 
  To implement reform of the personnel system, we must 
formulate reform methods according to the merits of different 
categories of enterprises. Enterprises implementing the 
corporate system should choose and employ cadres in line with 
the company law, and enterprises implementing the contract 
system should establish a strict mechanism that combines 
incentives with restraints and select managers and plant 
directors on this basis. 
  To push Hebei's economy forward, the most important is to 
solve the issue on making proper use of personnel. Only by 
successfully building ranks of party and government cadres and 
enterpreneurs, can Hebei have hopes. If it simply makes no 
difference whether the enterpreneurs of a place work or loaf, 
whether they do a good or bad job, or whether they make 
achievements or not, this place will have no hope of running its 
enterprises well. 
<H5>  It Is Necessary To Emancipate the Mind and Find a Way To </H5>
Extricate Ourselves From a Difficult Position Through Various 
Methods, Such as Reform and Opening Up 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: Difficulties are many, but methods 
will usually outnumber difficulties. As long as money-losing 
enterprises emancipate the mind and seek development actively, 
they will finally find a way to overcome difficulties and to 
extricate themselves from a difficult position. Enterprises 
with given conditions should strive to find partners in foreign 
countries or outside the territory and conduct transformation 
through grafting because this will be helpful not only to 
promoting technological progress but also to changing 
operational mechanism. Some plants in the downtown areas may be 
moved to the suburban areas so as to make room for developing 
commerce, service trade, and real estate industry. All 
state-owned industrial enterprises should make use of their own 
conditions and advantages to actively develop tertiary industry 
so as to disperse the surplus labor forces, to develop social 
service industry, and to increase enterprise income. 
  Party committees and governments at all levels should stress 
the dedicated spirit of enterpreneurs and give them full 
political honor and material incentives. As for enterpreneurs 
with great contributions, the party and government should give 
them a handsome award with perfect assurance, and enterpreneurs 
should also boldly take the awards. It is also necessary to 
strictly punish enterprise responsible persons who cause an 
enterprise to close down for subjective reasons so as to give a 
fairly big impetus to and impose a pressure on plant directors 
and managers of enterprises. 
<H5>  Paying Attention To Study and Strengthening Study Is the Key </H5>
To Coping With the New Situation and Successfully Carrying Out 
Reform 
  At present, we are facing many new problems in the course of 
deepening reform. Along with the unceasing deepening of reform, 
we have to step up our efforts to get familiar with many things 
unfamiliar to us and to resolve many new problems. It will be 
difficult to smoothly accomplish enterprise reform if our reform 
knowledge, ideology, and understanding cannot catch up with it. 
Therefore, party and government cadres or plant directors and 
managers should strengthen study and pay attention to study. We 
should study the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the market economic knowledge, all sorts of 
major reform measures issued by the central authorities, and the 
relevant laws and regulations on the market economy. Young 
cadres, if conditions permit, should also study international 
economic knowledge and foreign languages.

<F P=106> [Speech of Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial </F>
CPC Committee, made at the forum on cultivating and nurturing 
entrepreneurs cosponsored by the provincial party committee and 
the provincial government on 1 May] 
  [Text] With the focus on cultivating and nurturing the 
ranks of entrepreneurs, this forum discusses the issues on how 
to deepen the discussion of the issue concerning entrepreneurs 
and on how to reform the enterprise cadre management methods to 
make the cadre and personnel affairs work suit the demands of 
the market economy. I am going to set forth the following three 
opinions: 
  1. The buildup of the entrepreneur ranks has become the key 
to deepening the economic structural reform and building our 
province into an economically powerful province. 
  Achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises, 
particularly state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, is 
an important and difficult task in setting up the socialist 
market economic system. If we fail to achieve and enliven the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the course of 
reforming the economic system, the dominant role of the state 
sector of the economy will become weakened, the new market 
economic system will not take shape, and the socialist nature of 
the market economy will seriously be affected. Enlivening and 
achieving state-owned enterprises, particularly large and 
medium-sized enterprises, is a basic task for deepening the 
economic structural reform and building an economically powerful 
province. The state and the government certainly assume the 
responsibility for achieving and enlivening state-owned 
enterprises. For instance, the state and the government should 
strengthen macroeconomic control to create conditions for 
enlivening the microeconomy, should delegate power to lower 
levels according to the requirements as set forth in the 
"enterprise law" and the "regulations" to make enterprises 
actually have the rights to independent management, and should 
positively provide enterprises with a social guarantee system 
and the conditions for setting up markets to create a good 
social environment for changing the enterprise managerial 
mechanism. However, the key to actually enlivening and 
achieving state-owned enterprises hinges on enterprises 
themselves. The enterprises should grasp favorable 
opportunities, apply the state and the government's policies and 
laws as well as various resources provided by the markets, work 
out accurate policy decisions, and achieve management. External 
cause is the condition for changes and internal cause is the 
basis for changes. So, the key to enlivening enterprises hinges 
and depends on enterprises themselves. 
  The key to achieving and enlivening state-owned enterprises 
under appropriate conditions hinges on personnel. To solve the 
problems in this regard, there must be outstanding entrepreneurs 
with both professional ability and political integrity, with 
knowledge of the market economy, with management ability, with 
courage and insight, with the daring to make attempts and to do 
pioneering work, and with the courage to keep forging ahead. 
Countless facts prove that with an outstanding entrepreneur, an 
enterprise will be able to find out information, products, 
technologies, capital, and skilled persons. An outstanding 
entrepreneur is able to grasp favorable opportunities, overcome 
existing difficulties, and find out ways and methods for 
eliminating contradictions. An enterprise lacking an 
outstanding entrepreneur, cannot enliven itself although its 
external conditions are good. At present, enterprises' deficits 
increase by a big margin due to historical, realistic, and 
objective reasons. But, responsible persons of enterprises 
should be held responsible for some of the reasons because they 
do not have sufficient motivation and pressure. The importance 
of the role of entrepreneur to an enterprise is thus clear! To 
achieve and enliven state-owned enterprises and develop the 
socialist market economy, we must cultivate a large number of 
outstanding entrepreneurs. 
  2. We should strengthen organizational leadership and 
deepen the discussions of the issue concerning entrepreneurs. 
  The publication of Comrade Zhang Shire's [name as published] 
article drew attention from all fronts. Press units also 
organized the personages of all fronts to express opinions and 
hold discussions. Relevant departments under the 
provincial-level organs also thought out and explored ways for 
building up and cultivating an outstanding of entrepreneur rank. 
The question at present is how to further draw the attention of 
all fronts and to deepen the discussion of this issue. 
  Our aim in supporting this discussion is to unify the 
understanding of the leaders at various levels and all social 
fronts, to promote the economic structural reform, to realize 
the target of building an economically powerful province, and to 
mobilize all fronts to pay attention to, support, cultivate, and 
build up a large number of outstanding entrepreneurs. To deepen 
this discussion, we should grasp the following few key points: 
  A. The leaders at various levels and all fronts in society 
should define entrepreneurs's key positions and functions in 
enterprises and the market economy. This issue is not only a 
matter relating to entrepreneurs themselves as well as some 
government departments but also a matter that should be defined 
by the leaders at various levels and all fronts in society. 
  B. Entrepreneurs themselves should further make efforts to 
upgrade their own quality to suit the new situation of the 
market economy. They must not remain satisfied with being plant 
directors and managers under the planned economic conditions any 
longer but should strive to be outstanding entrepreneurs 
fighting under the market economic system. 
  C. Party committees, governments, people's congresses, and 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
organizations, and all departments concerned should regard 
entrepreneurs as the most important factor of production 
factors, proceed from the development of productive forces, and 
mobilize all fronts to support, show concern about, protect, and 
cherish entrepreneurs. Governments should change their functions 
and delegate power to lower levels. Legislation and law 
enforcement departments should protect the legal rights and 
interests of entrepreneurs. All discussions, party committees, 
governments, and all departments should determine ways to 
support entrepreneurs. 
  D. Organizational and personnel affairs departments should 
emancipate the mind, renew ideas, and reform the ways for 
management of enterprise cadres according to the new situation 
of the market economy. There are differences between enterprise 
cadres and the local party committee workers and government 
officers. Therefore, enterprises should carry out the 
competition mechanism in selecting and employing cadres. 
Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should optimize 
reasonable distribution and organization according to the 
principle of market competition. 
  E. How can the restructuring departments and the industrial 
and commercial management departments closely link the 
implementation of the modern enterprise system with the reform 
of the enterprise cadre management system in the course of 
reforming the enterprise system? They should select and employ 
outstanding entrepreneurs to promote the reform of the 
enterprise property right system and the setup of the modern 
enterprise system. Simultaneously, they should also be good at 
discovering and employing, through selection, outstanding 
entrepreneurs in the course of setting up the modern enterprise 
system. 
  3. According to the market's economic requirements, we 
should 
positively promote the reform of the enterprise cadre management 
system. 
  The organizational and personnel affairs departments should 
attend to the following few principles in order to promote the 
reform of the enterprise cadre management system according to 
the requirements of the market economy. 
  A. According to enterprises' different situations, 
organizational and personnel affairs departments should set 
forth different new ideas and methods for managing the cadres of 
enterprises of different categories. There are four different 
categories of enterprises as follows: 
  The first category indicates the state-owned enterprises 
where systems have been reformed and the shareholding system is 
mainly carried out. The shareholding enterprises have four 
conditions. First, limited liability companies. The companies 
of this kind involve those with legal persons as their 
shareholders and those wholly funded by the state. Second, 
limited companies. The companies of this kind involve those 
with legal persons and staff members and workers as shareholders 
and those where fixed amounts of shares are sold to society by 
legal persons. The second category indicates the state-owned 
enterprises where systems have not been reformed yet and the 
contract system is being carried out. The third category 
indicates the urban collective enterprises whose cadres had been 
transferred by the governments for a long period of time in the 
past. The fourth category indicates the rural and urban 
collective enterprises where a considerable number of cadres are 
transferred by the town and township governments. Now, we are 
going to study the methods of managing the cadres of the 
enterprises of these four different categories and will set 
forth methods for selecting, recommending, and employing cadres 
for these enterprises according to the requirements of the 
market economy. 
  B. To cultivate and nurture entrepreneurs, we should not 
only provide the necessary conditions for cultivation but also 
select the best and eliminate the worst through competition. 
Therefore, we must create an environment where entrepreneurs can 
compete with one another on equal terms. We should work out 
encouragement and restriction mechanisms and have the daring to 
give handsome awards and inflict heavy punishment so that a 
group of outstanding entrepreneurs will emerge and a group of 
incompetent enterprise responsible persons will be eliminated. 
Up until now, our enterprise cadres only promoted but never 
demoted anyone. Handsome awards could not be given to those who 
made contributions, and those who were incompetent could not be 
eliminated. Motivation and pressure was insufficient. Our 
state-owned enterprise leading cadres and entrepreneurs' quality 
is not lower than that of individual and private enterprise 
entrepreneurs, and the work of state-owned enterprise leading 
cadres and entrepreneurs is more difficult than that of 
individual and private enterprise entrepreneurs. Why does the 
state allow the entrepreneurs of private and individual 
enterprises to make larger amounts of money for themselves? Why 
are our state-owned enterprises not given proper remuneration 
from making larger amounts of profits and creating profits and 
taxes for the state? Heavy award means further mobilizing 
entrepreneurs' enthusiasm through material and honorary awards. 
On the other hand, if you make enterprises go bankrupt due to 
your incompetence, you will no longer be entitled to being a 
cadre or enjoying a good reputation in society. You will 
neither register yourselves to the industrial and commercial 
administrative departments within a set time nor be appointed as 
enterprise responsible persons by any enterprises. Awards must 
be handsome and penalties must be heavy. There must be such 
examples of courage and daring. The province as well as all 
localities should explore scientific and reasonable ideas and 
methods for handsome awards and heavy penalties. 
  C. Entrepreneurs, as a production factor, should enter 
markets. Distribution needs to be reasonable and organization 
needs to be optimized. We should positively make preparations 
and set up entrepreneur markets. I hope that Tangshan and 
Shijiazhuang cities take the lead in this regard. We should 
formulate regulations and methods governing entrepreneur markets. 
  D. We should proceed from the reality of the market economy 
to positively explore ways for management of enterprise cadres. 
First, there should be realistic requirements for 
entrepreneurs' ages and records of formal schooling. Second, we 
should popularize Tangshan's methods for recommending and 
appointing cadres by the organizational and personnel affairs 
departments. That is, recommend and appoint a cadre or a top 
leader for an enterprise. Third, the enterprises with conditions 
can carry out the method that enterprise party and government 
cadres "assume full responsibility." 
  E. Entrepreneurs' associations, organizations of 
entrepreneurs themselves, should understand and reflect the 
voices of entrepreneurs and make efforts to protect the legal 
rights and interests of entrepreneurs. Simultaneously, these 
associations should play a positive role in upgrading 
entrepreneurs' quality and cultivating and nurturing 
entrepreneur ranks.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, 20 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- 
Hebei Province is one of the regions seriously plagued by iodine 
deficiency. Since last October, the authorities in the province 
have adopted firm measures to rectify the salt market. So far, 
they have outlawed 187 contraband salt markets and effectively 
halted the once-rampant selling of inferior and iodineless salt. 
The general public can now enjoy regular salt, which sets their 
mind at ease. 
  Iodine deficiency is known to cause congenital problems, 
such 
as imbecility, dumbness, and sterility. Hebei is a major 
producer of sea salt, yet iodine deficiency is quite common 
there, and it is one of the most seriously affected regions in 
China. The population in the province's affected areas is a 
high 26.55 million. In recent years, owing to such factors as 
loss of control over the production of edible salt and loose 
management, large quantities of inferior and iodineless salt 
have reached the consumers via contraband salt markets, 
expanding the use of iodineless salt and causing the incidence 
of deficiency cases in the affected areas to show a renewed 
upward trend. 
  To safeguard public health, Hebei Province set about 
organizing a specialized campaign against contraband salt 
trafficking last October. The supply and marketing 
cooperatives, industrial and commercial administration bureaus, 
public security authorities, and salt management departments 
cooperated closely with each other, plugged the source of such 
salt and intercepted its flow, imposed stern sanctions on 
saltworks engaged in illegal transactions, and firmly outlawed 
contraband salt markets. So far, the authorities in the 
province have handled more than 10,400 cases of contraband salt 
trafficking and have confiscated 39,157 metric tons of 
contraband salt.

  [Text] Hohhot, May 16 (XINHUA) -- North China's Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region has made painstaking efforts to boost 
its rural industry and the endeavor has begun to bear fruit. 
  Statistics show that in the first four months of this year, 
rural and township enterprises in the autonomous region 
generated 6.71 billion yuan of output value and produced 800 
million yuan of profits and taxes, both more than doubling that 
in the same period of last year. 
  The implementation of the central government's strategy of 
accelerating the development of rural and township industry in 
the country's central and northwest areas has created a 
favorable environment for Inner Mongolia to develop rural 
industry, but its growth has long been hindered by a shortage of 
funds. 
  Early this year, the autonomous region set up a leading 
group 
to coordinate rural and township enterprises and initiated a 
special development fund for rural and township enterprises. 
  The fund is established with the purpose of helping existing 
rural enterprises to enlarge production and helping poor and 
remote rural areas start more rural enterprises. 
  To ensure effective input of funds for rural enterprises and 
guarantee efficient use of money, the autonomous region has also 
worked out rules which stipulate that rural and township 
enterprises should report their new projects and detailed 
procedures for starting the projects. 
  The establishment of the fund has provided a financial 
guarantee to help boost the autonomous region's rural industry. 
  According to local officials, Inner Mongolia invested one 
billion yuan to develop rural industry in the first quarter of 
this year. 
  It also plans to pump a total of 2.5 billion yuan in loans 
into the development of rural industry this year, an increase of 
50 percent compared with last year.

  [Text] Taiyuan, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Shanxi Province, China's 
leading coal producer, is promoting scientific and technological 
exchanges and cooperation with foreign counterparts in 
agriculture, energy, environmental protection, and coal chemical 
industry and building materials. 
  The province has introduced high-quality species of oriental 
cherries, apples and pears from Japan to six counties. 
  Shanxi is also popularizing Israeli advanced 
cotton-cultivation technology on 2,000 hectares of farmland in 
Yongji county near the yellow river. 
  France's fine-bred goats are now being raised in the 
province. 
  The province has invested 116 million yuan including 12 
million U.S. dollars in loans from the UN Food Program to 
undertake a water conservancy program in the area of the Luliang 
mountains. The project will benefit 31 townships and 248,000 
people. 
  The International Agricultural Development Fund has invested 
about 63.46 million yuan in a comprehensive agricultural 
development program in five counties. It is expected that about 
80,000 households in the rural areas will benefit from the 
projects. 
  Last year, the World Bank inspected the area of Luliang 
mountains and is planning to give a loan of 240 million U.S. 
dollars to aid the development in the poverty-stricken region. 
  Shanxi Province has also set offices in north America and 
Southeast Asian countries to promote its high and new technology 
to international markets. 
  In an international fair held in Germany in 1993, Shanxi 
Province presented 15 new and high technology products. It 
reaped 10 million U.S. dollars in transactions at the fair.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 15 (XINHUA) -- With the recent 
establishment of an international commodities exhibition and 
marketing center, this port city has taken another step towards 
establishing an international free trade zone. 
  Officials in charge of the free trade zone, or bonded zone, 
here said that the zone has been expanding rapidly since it was 
established three years ago. It is also one of the largest 
among China's 14 bonded zones. 
  So far, the free trade zone has approved a total of 2,338 
enterprises involving some 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in 
investment volume. Investors include those from 54 countries 
and regions as well as from inland provinces in northwest China. 
  Some 1,000 companies in the zone have started operation. 
Total import and export volume in the first quarter of the year 
topped 400 million U.S. dollars. 
  Within six months after the approval of the establishment of 
the zone, about 180 km from Beijing, infrastructural facilities 
were completed. Later, a series of laws and regulations for the 
zone were issued to safeguard the interests of overseas 
investors. 
  Following that, ventures from both abroad and within China 
began to pour into the zone, and within one year, all 1.2 sq 
[square] km of land had been parceled out to investors. Then 
another 3.6 sq km of land was added to the previous zone. 
  A series of preferential policies including tax reduction 
and 
exemption were adopted in the zone. More than a dozen famous 
international companies, such as Honeywell Inc. and the American 
President Shipping Company of the United States, the New World 
Group Company of Hong Kong and the Singapore Shipping 
Corporation, have set up operations there. 
  The Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, 
neighboring the free trade zone, has also harbored more than 
1,000 industrial enterprises, making it the largest development 
zone in China in terms of the amount of investment.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Tianjin, China's 
northern port city, has just mapped out a bold plan to upgrade 
its shopping facilities in the upcoming few years to make it an 
international shopping metropolis. 
  According to the plan, Tianjin Municipal Government will 
concentrate on the construction of ten commercial streets, 18 
shopping centers, five large department stores and six wholesale 
markets, which are expected to extend for a dozen kilometers. 
  According to a municipal official, a number of foreign 
investors have shown keen interest in investing in such 
construction. Shopping facilities with two million square meters 
in total floor space like the Huaxing Shopping Building, Fuyu 
Plaza and Olympic Building are being built with overseas 
investment. 
  Tianjin's large-scale construction of shopping facilities 
has 
offered an excellent opportunity for foreign investment, said an 
official from the Municipal Planning Bureau. He said Tianjin 
has a number of golden shopping areas which remain undeveloped. 
Tianjin has stipulated a series of preferential policies for 
foreign investment to develop these areas, he said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Prevent Hong Kong People From Getting Involved </F>
in Controversies Over `Human Rights'"] 
  [Text] Instigated by the British Foreign Affairs Select 
Committee report on human rights issues, some pro-British and 
anti-Chinese forces in Hong Kong have made use of various 
opportunities to influence public opinion into urging the 
British Hong Kong Government to do two things prior to 1997, 
namely: First, to set up a committee to "supervise human rights 
conditions in Hong Kong after 1997"; and second, to negotiate 
with the Chinese side on the applicability of the two 
international covenants on human rights in Hong Kong, while 
demanding that the Chinese Government regularly reports on human 
rights conditions in Hong Kong after 1997 to the UN Commission 
on Human Rights and accepts its supervision. 
  Lu Ping, deputy director and secretary-general of the 
Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR], recently made an 
explicit response on those two issues. He indicated that the 
establishment of a committee on human rights in Hong Kong would 
obviously run counter to the Basic Law. Should such a committee 
be set up, that would turn out to be something "alien" in the 
future and would definitely be abolished after 1997. The parts 
of the two international pacts on human rights applicable to 
Hong Kong will be implemented through Hong Kong laws after 1997 
in accordance with the stipulations in the Basic Law. China is 
not a signatory of the two human rights pacts and has no 
responsibility or obligation whatsoever to report to the UN 
Commission on Human Rights on Hong Kong human rights conditions. 
These words are convincing enough. 
  What should Hong Kong rely on in protecting human rights 
after 1997? A law or an organization alone? Of course, we 
should rely on the Basic Law formulated with Hong Kong 
residents' hearts and souls and not an organization set up at 
the instigation of a handful of pro-British and anti-Chinese 
elements. During the Sino-British talks in 1984, the Chinese 
Government announced a series of basic principles and policies 
toward Hong Kong which included the stipulation that "the Hong 
Kong SAR Government will protect the rights and freedoms of the 
residents and other people in the Hong Kong SAR in accordance 
with the law. The Hong Kong SAR Government maintains the rights 
and freedoms stipulated in Hong Kong's existing laws...." 
Later, these policies were fixed in the form of the Basic Law 
and became solemn legal provisions which nobody can violate. The 
National People's Congress has endowed Hong Kong residents with 
a legal weapon to protect their own legitimate rights, 
interests, and freedoms. So long as we resolutely safeguard the 
Basic Law after 1997, the basic rights and freedoms of Hong Kong 
residents will be protected. 
  If some people think that human rights can be guaranteed 
only 
in those countries and regions where committees on human rights 
are set up, is it not like saying that human rights do not exist 
in the many countries in the world where such committees are 
absent? Britain and the United States do not have committees on 
human rights. Does this prove that there are no human rights in 
Britain and the United States? 
  In 1991, when some people in Hong Kong set out the need to 
establish a committee on human rights, the Hong Kong government 
stated explicitly that the issue would not be taken into 
consideration, saying that "having referred to the experiences 
of some countries which have set up committees on human rights, 
including Canada and Australia, the Hong Kong Authorities 
believe that the need to set up a committee on human rights does 
not exist." How will the British Hong Kong Government answer 
the question today? 
  The organization for a committee on human rights does not 
exist in the Basic Law. Some people are going all out to 
advocate the establishment of such an organization. In fact, 
this is their attempt to sow the seed of instability after 1997 
and make this a breakthrough for revising the Basic Law. 
  Regarding the relevant clauses in the "International 
Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights" and the "International Covenant 
on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights" which are applicable 
to Hong Kong, it is stipulated in the Basic Law that they "will 
continue to be effective" and will be "implemented through the 
law of the Hong Kong SAR." Here, it says that only those 
clauses "which are applicable to Hong Kong" in these two 
international covenants will be effective and does not mean they 
will be copied in their entirety. They must be implemented by 
Hong Kong SAR laws after 1997 and the British Hong Kong 
Government should not intervene by making any stipulations. 
  Some people are clamoring for Hong Kong to adopt the two 
covenants before 1997 and cannot wait to use some of the clauses 
helpful to them to revise existing laws (such as legal documents 
on media operations and the government regulations on security 
and social security) and to serve their purpose of formulating 
the "law on freedom to seek information [zi xun 6327 6061]" and 
"draft regulations on the committee for human rights and equal 
opportunities." 
  The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the 
existing Hong Kong laws will remain basically unchanged. The 
Basic Law stipulates that, with the founding of the SAR, the 
existing laws of Hong Kong will be adopted as the Hong Kong SAR 
laws with the exception of those nominated by the NPC Standing 
Committee as running counter to the Basic Law. Should any more 
of the existing laws be found to run counter to the Basic Law, 
they will be revised and terminated in accordance with the 
procedures stipulated in the Basic Law. Should the British Hong 
Kong Government make any revisions of its existing laws running 
counter to the Basic Law before 1997, or formulate decrees and 
regulations in violation of the Basic Law, these will all be 
abolished after 1997. Some people are attempting to introduce 
the two international covenants on human rights before 1997 and 
compel the Chinese Government to bear the obligation to report 
Hong Kong human rights conditions to the UN Commission on Human 
Rights. Obviously, they want to make preparations to add 
international pressure to impeding the NPC Standing Committee 
from abolishing the decrees and regulations which run counter to 
the Basic Law. Nevertheless, that is just a one-sided wish. 
  Some people think that, at the instigation of the British 
Foreign Affairs Select Committee report, the British Hong Kong 
Government and its followers have made a great fuss over the 
human rights issue in an attempt to push Hong Kong into the 
vortex of controversies over "human rights," confuse right and 
wrong, and achieve their ulterior motive. We really must be 
vigilant and guard against this.

<F P=106> [By political desk and agencies] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong legislators yesterday united to condemn 
President Jiang Zemin of China for saying that five years of 
prosperity and stability proved that the June 4 massacre was 
correct. "A bad thing has been turned into a good thing," Jiang 
was quoted by official media yesterday as telling the Malaysian 
Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. "As a result, our reform and 
opening programme has forged ahead with steadier, better, and 
even quicker steps, and our advantages have been brought into 
fuller play." 
  Jiang said the communist leadership had no choice on June 
3-4, 1989, but to crush the mass protests. "History shows that 
anything conducive to our national stability is good," said 
Jiang, who rose to power with the removal of Zhao Ziyang as 
party leader. "Without the resolute measures taken then, China 
would not have enjoyed today's stability. In the past five 
years, China has enjoyed economic development, social stability 
and improved livelihood of the people, thanks to our consistent 
efforts to take stability as an overriding priority. Facts 
prove this is absolutely correct." 
  But Robin Munro, the Hong Kong director of Human Rights 
Watch/Asia, questioned whether the suppression of June 4 has 
really made China more stable. "The increasing number of 
strikes and peasant protests suggest a social pressure cooker 
that has all the signs of being dangerously unstable," Munro 
said. "By crushing the Tiananmen protests, they enforced a 
short-term stability, but evidently at a higher long-term cost." 
  Jiang's comments -- carried in the Communist Party's 
official 
mouthpiece, the People's Daily, and other newspapers -- are 
likely to be repeated in coming weeks as Chinese people and the 
world media reflect on the deadly collision of hope, chaos and 
force five years ago. 
  Hong Kong legislators were dismayed by Jiang's comments. Lau 
Chin-shek, a United Democrat, said he believed those who 
committed the massacre would be held responsible "sooner or 
later". "Jiang's hardline remarks will only remind people to 
commemorate the massacre and rekindle people's hatred," he said. 
  Cheng Kai-nam, the general secretary of the pro-Beijing 
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, urged the 
Chinese government to recognise the "mistake" of June 4. "If 
people are not happy with their government, they have every 
right to express their feelings," he said. "There is no way the 
government should use violent means." 
  Frederick Fung, the leader of the Association for Democracy 
and People's Livelihood, said it showed that Beijing had not 
modernised in the past five years. "To have a good economic 
performance is the basic obligation of a government. 
  "It is no big deal and should not be linked up with the 
philosophy of political repression," he said. 
  The Liberal Party's Henry Tang also questioned the 
justification for the use of force. "There could have been 
other means to solve the problem like the use of plastic bullets 
and water cannon instead of tank and guns. That is not the only 
way of crowd dispersement." 
  An independent legislator, Andrew Wong, said there was a 
simple explanation for Jiang's remarks. "China and Malaysia see 
eye to eye on the philosophy of feeding their peoples first. 
The two leaders share the same culture," he said. "Second, 
China has to show that they do not buy the Americans' concept of 
human rights. They made it clear that the renewal of MFN must 
not be linked with human rights."

  [Text] Millions of potential holders of British National 
(Overseas) (BNO) passports face having to apply for travel visas 
for almost all countries except Britain after 1997. China's 
refusal to cooperate with Britain in lobbying for recognition of 
the validity of BNO passports threatens to cause serious 
problems, a senior Hong Kong government official warned 
yesterday. 
  Seventy-one countries grant visa-free status to the BNO 
passport but such arrangements could be scrapped by all except 
Britain after 1997. 
  An absence of clear recognition of the BNO by China would 
leave countries with the fear that if a BNO passport holder was 
declared an undesirable person, Britain would not take 
responsibility for repatriation nor would there be any guarantee 
that person could be returned to the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region (SAR). "The situation is really worse than 
most people seem to realise," the official said. "The main 
practical consideration of the third country is will Britain 
take these people back when they have problems?" 
  Britain wants an understanding with China that the British 
will lobby for the visa-free arrangements to continue for the 
BNO after 1997 as well as the Hong Kong SAR passports issued by 
China after 1997. SAR passports will be issued to Hong Kong 
residents who were formerly CI (Certificate of Identity) holders 
and the Hong Kong born who do not wish to carry BNO passports. 
  "What Britain will need is a letter from China to say that 
is 
no problem and BNO will continue," the official said. 
"Likewise, for China, they need the Hong Kong Government to 
tell the third countries that SAR passports are just as reliable 
as BNO. Otherwise they are going to get nowhere with SAR 
passports and the BNO is not going to be what they gave everyone 
the impression that it would be, which is a travel document 
which can be used after 1997." 
  He said there was no sign at present that Beijing saw the 
practical need to work together with Hong Kong. "What we are 
trying to do is to try to make a practical arrangement in 
advance of 1997. We are not fighting for BNO against SAR 
passports," he said. 
  The Hong Kong government has expressed a willingness to 
cooperate with China in issuing SAR passports before 1997 
because it would take two to three years for the new passport to 
be recognised by foreign countries. 
  The government official warned that Hong Kong's economic 
prosperity could be undermined if people's freedom of travel was 
affected. 
  Some 3.3 million people in Hong Hong are eligible for the 
BNO 
passport, the travel document that will replace the British 
Dependent Territory Citizen (BDTC) passport after 1997. More 
than 500,000 people already possess BNO passports, which give 
people right of entry but not right of abode, in Britain. 
  Countries offering visa-free treatment to BNO passports 
include Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Malaysia, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, South Africa, and Thailand. Only 
Switzerland has said current arrangements will not change after 
1997. 
  A Thai consulate-general spokesman said the future situation 
"depends on the status of this passport (BNO) in the British 
system and how it will be treated by the UK Government itself".

<F P=106> [Article by Legislative Councillor Christine Loh: </F>
"Blinkered Visions"] 
  [Text] Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, told a business audience last week: "There are 
those who believe that only when China turns capitalist that 
Hong Kong's capitalism can be guaranteed. This is an entirely 
wrong concept." With this, I agree. 
  However, Lu's reasoning is incorrect. Hong Kong people want 
to practise capitalism and much more. We also want to enjoy a 
system of representative government, human rights and the rule 
of law. It is precisely because China has an authoritarian 
government and low respect for human rights, and because it 
practises rule by man, that people believe that only when the 
Chinese government becomes less repressive and more democratic 
will Hong Kong's lifestyle and freedoms be guaranteed. 
  In limiting Hong Kong's desires to capitalism, Lu 
misunderstands the territory. Chinese leaders may believe that 
making money is all Hong Kong people care about and that it is, 
therefore, their reason for wanting to retain the economic 
system beyond 1997. But the leaders are wrong. The "one 
country, two systems" concept also means our social, cultural 
and developing political systems. 
  Lu said on May 6 there would always be a "handful" who 
thought they could "turn Hong Kong into a political city in 
order to influence the mainland in the sense of politics". He 
warned that Hong Kong would then be of "negative value" to 
China. On May 8, Lu clarified that statement to pro-China trade 
unionists, saying Hong Kong should not become a base to convert 
China to democracy. 
  Socialism and democracy are, after all, not mutually 
exclusive, but Chinese leaders are accustomed to authoritarian 
rule. The director really meant that China is hostile to 
democracy in Hong Kong because it fears that democracy might 
spread. Because of this fear, Beijing sees attitudes towards 
democracy in Hong Kong as the dividing line between its friends 
and supposed enemies. Those who are outspoken in their support 
of democracy have already, in effect, been warned that they will 
not he allowed to hold any political office after 1997. They 
are accused of being unpatriotic, even subversive. 
  And perhaps the issue of human rights is also becoming a 
measure of loyalty to the motherland. Human rights serve to 
define the relationship between the government and the governed, 
and to limit the powers of the state over the individual. 
Individual rights are dangerous to Beijing because they promote 
values which make Hong Kong the "political city" that Chinese 
leaders fear. For example, Beijing must find irksome the 
continued support for the release of the Ming Pao reporter, Xi 
Yang, who was jailed for 12 years for allegedly stealing state 
banking secrets. 
  No doubt China's leaders are also beginning to find 
threatening the continued call for a human rights commission in 
Hong Kong. Lu said such a body would contravene the Basic Law 
because it was not set out in the future mini-constitution. 
Perhaps he conveniently forgot that "other special courts" can 
be established. Perhaps a rent tribunal might be more 
acceptable than a human rights version. 
  Lu disputes that Hong Kong people even care about politics. 
He says that if you ask anyone in the street about their 
primary concern, 90 per cent will say their livelihoods. But 
the director misses the point. Concerns for housing, welfare, 
education, the environment, corruption, law and order, and even 
equality of the sexes are highly political issues. 
  The formulation and implementation of public policy in Hong 
Kong is as much about the process as it is about the end 
product. People expect to be consulted each step of the way, 
and they expect important issues to be publicly debated. Hong 
Kong people demanded that the policy-making process should 
become more open. Now, they have also insisted on being given 
enough information to be able to assess policies and to hold the 
executive accountable. 
  It is against this background that Hong Kong wants a more 
representative system of government. And it is this development 
that makes Hong Kong a vibrant political city. This is not the 
work of a "handful" of people, but of all residents of Hong Kong. 
  Lu failed to win the hearts and minds of Hong Kong because 
Beijing does not want to deal with all these views. China's 
united-front strategy cannot cope with opposing views. Until 
this changes, Beijing will continue to pretend that only a 
"handful" have different ideas about how "one country, two 
systems" should work.

<F P=106> ["Off My Chest" column by Neville de Silva from the "Focus" </F>
page: "Lu Ping's Dismal Visit Shows the Heavy Hand of Beijing"] 
  [Text] However much apologists try to colour wash Hong 
Kong and Macao Affairs Director Lu Ping's visit here to make it 
seem a success, the truth is that he did not endear himself to 
the Hong Kong people. There are those who will airily dismiss 
public opinion polls as of little meaning and significance, 
unless of course such polls tend to buttress their own 
viewpoints. 
  Even if one concedes this, the comments of some considered 
sympathetic to Beijing appear to reflect public displeasure at 
Lu Ping's crass discourtesy in refusing to even say hello to 
Governor Patten. That exhibition of poor taste and even worse 
diplomacy, was compounded by the often contradictory 
explanations offered by Chinese officials and their sycophants 
for Mr Lu's inability to find a few minutes to meet the governor. 
  To add to this dismal performance, Mr Lu's former deputy, 
and 
now Bank of China director Wang Qiren, came up with a puerile 
explanation for not inviting Mr Patten to the note-issuing 
ceremony. It might have been lapped up by sympathetic media, but 
would have sounded silly to anybody with the mental age of even 
a 10-year old. 
  To cap it all, Mr Lu could not find a few minutes to 
formally 
meet the press. Was it because he feared being trapped in their 
own consistencies or was it another instance of Beijing's 
contempt for the Hong Kong people and the value system they 
would like to preserve? 
  Before Mr Lu even set foot in Hong Kong, Chinese officials 
were quick to explain that the director's nine-day itinerary was 
full to the last millisecond. While Chinese officials were 
claiming that a packed programme forbade a visit to Government 
House, the Chinese media proffered its own excuses. Lu Ping was 
like the master and Chris Patten like the caretaker and there 
was no reason for the master to meet the caretaker. 
  Whatever one thinks of the appositeness of that simile--here 
is a caretaker who is not of the master's choosing--the tone 
suggests that Imperial China still lives on in socialist China, 
despite all the Marxist rhetoric about a people's republic and 
other slogans, fast turning into shibboleths under the thrust of 
capitalist economics. The fact is that Mr Lu behaved like a 
petty potentate, a sign surely of the vertically regimented 
political structure he represents. 
  Having first said that a busy schedule prevented Mr Lu from 
meeting Mr Patten, the Chinese then came up with another 
explanation. The governor had not been very friendly towards 
the China-appointed Preliminary Working Committee. That was the 
reason Mr Lu adduced later. In the meantime, there had been 
other explanations from the Chinese as well as their camp 
followers. Given the state of bilateral relations, they said, 
nothing would have been achieved by such a meeting. 
  Some apologists argued that a meeting between Mr Lu and Mr 
Patten was not important. After all, he was coming here to 
attend the PWC meeting and that was the prime concern. Others 
argued that the visit was symbolic, as it showed that Chinese 
officials can come to Hong Kong, talk about Hong Kong, meet with 
Hong Kong people (or a select few) while totally ignoring the 
Hong Kong Government. 
  One might have believed some of these stories had Mr Lu's 
busy schedule been jampacked with discussions with the PWC. How 
much of his time here was really spent at PWC meetings and how 
much of it talking to the business community, to pro-China trade 
unions, closeted with Xinhua officials and other pro-China 
elements? 
  Why wasn't Mr Patten invited to the Bank of China ceremony? 
Because the organisers thought that the governor would be too 
busy. This excuse is both stupid and crude. Perhaps it is 
another sign of the condescending attitude of Beijing officials 
to the Hong Kong people? 
  What is more, Mr Lu publicly issued a political message just 
as Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and Sir Percy Cradock had done 
before him. The real significance of all this has, 
unfortunately, escaped attention. Mr Lu or Mr Lee can speak 
their minds freely in Hong Kong, even criticise the chief 
executive publicly. 
  Will this still be possible three years or so from now? 
Apart from foreign visitors coming here and talking openly, 
will the Hong Kong people themselves be able to do so without 
being branded as subversives and possibly incarcerated? Will 
even the media be able to discuss issues freely, seeing how 
China reacted the other day to protesting Hong Kong journalists? 
  That is the question Hong Kong people should ask themselves. 
Lu Ping has done little to stem the growing belief that the 
concept of "one country, two systems" is nothing more than a 
high-faluting slogan. Rather, he strengthened fears that the 
essence of Hong Kong's life style will be slowly crushed by the 
juggernaut of Beijing authoritarianism.

<F P=106> [Article by political editor Fanny Wong] </F>
  [Text] They talk, they argue, they frown, they laugh in 
front of the camera, explaining policies and putting them into 
action. Technically they are the servants of the Crown, the 
policy-makers who determine the fate of Hong Kong's 
six-million-strong population. 
  Day in and day out, Hong Kong people take it for granted 
that 
these mandarins, the civil servants, are there and the services 
delivered. At midnight June 30, 1997, the Queen, the Union 
Jack, Governor Chris Patten will all become history in Hong 
Kong. But will all these familiar faces also be a matter of the 
past? Who determines their fate? China? Britain? Or Hong 
Kong? 
  After more than a decade of protracted preparation for 1997, 
the change in sovereignty from British to Chinese may not have 
such a profound impact on the man in the street, but for those 
striding along the corridors of power, it could make or break 
careers. So much has been said about continuity of service, but 
with China and Britain in dispute, there is simply no guarantee 
that the top brass of the Civil Service will ride the through 
train. 
  Mr Patten obviously has his short-list of candidates to fill 
the 22 principal official posts which, under the Basic Law, have 
to be occupied by Chinese nationals without right of abode in 
any foreign country. Beijing, having announced its plan to go 
it alone, is compiling its own list. Neither list has been 
finalised, but preferences are undoubtedly noted for some of the 
strategic positions. 
  Mr Patten's choices are expected to be the more 
straightforward, as the basic selection criteria should be the 
candidates' experience and expertise. China's consideration may 
be more complicated, as the leadership line-up will have to 
reflect the change of sovereignty. 
  In any case, the first Chief Executive of the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) Government, whose task will be to 
nominate and report to the Central People's Government on the 
appointment of principal officials, will have a lot of influence 
in drawing up the final list. The big question on the minds of 
Hong Kong's would-be leaders is how the two lists differ and how 
much disruption that will bring. 
  Under Mr Patten, the careers of the Chief Secretary, Anson 
Chan Fang On-sang, and the Secretary for the Civil Service, 
Michael Sze Cho-cheung, have blossomed, but whether they will 
wilt in the post- 1997 regime is anybody's guess. In the run-up 
to 1997, save for any unforeseen events, Mrs Chan is sure to 
stay on as Chief Secretary, and it has also emerged that Mr Sze 
is a leading contender to be the first local Financial 
Secretary. Word that both Mrs Chan and Mr Sze will be turfed 
off the civil service through train at the changeover may be too 
severe. 
  Equally, it might be rather optimistic to think they can 
continue to stay in the positions of enormous influence. When 
the mood in Zhongnanhai accords so much importance to 
allegiance, an automatic inheritance of the key players in the 
Patten administration is rather remote. By the same token those 
who are not seen as particularly favoured by the Governor and 
who do not openly promote his policy on Sino-British matters 
stand a better chance of moving up the hierarchy. 
  Joseph Yam Chi-kwong, head of the Monetary Authority, 
believed to be the public officer in Hong Kong most trusted by 
China, remains the front-runner as the post-1997 financial 
chief. As for the post of Chief Secretary, the Secretary for 
Home Affairs, Michael Suen Ming-yeung, is seen as one of 
Beijing's potential candidates. By 1997, Mr Suen will be the 
most senior local policy secretary, because Secretary for 
Education and Manpower, Michael Leung Mankin, is expected to 
retire by then. 
  Although Mr Suen, formerly Secretary for Constitutional 
Affairs held the sensitive position when Sino-British relations 
deteriorated in the aftermath of the June 4 massacre, his 
experience and relatively low-key and non-confrontational 
approach have made him stand out as a candidate for the top 
position. 
  The next most important post in the SAR hierarchy, but yet 
to 
be created, is Hong Kong's top representative in Beijing to 
lobby on its behalf with the central authorities. Ideally, Hong 
Kong should have set up its representative office in Beijing, 
but the current icy relationship has simply made that impossible. 
  But post-1997, such a post will be indispensable, and the 
candidates are expected to include Secretary for Economic 
Services, Gordon Siu Kwing-chue, and Secretary for 
Constitutional Affairs, Nicholas Ng Wing-fui. Their frequent 
contacts with Chinese officials have given them ample 
opportunity to deal with their mainland counterparts and 
understand the mainland system. 
  The policy branch for the Beijing office should be the 
Constitutional Affairs Branch. While Mr Ng currently occupies 
the post, in mapping out the new team Mr Patten may want to 
bring in some new blood, such as Lam Woon-kwong, currently 
Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower. Mr Lam's recent 
performance in handling the old age pension proposal is 
understood to have impressed the administration. His good 
political sense may also put him on the list as the post-1997 
constitutional chief. 
  Another sensitive position is the Secretary for Security 
post 
which is expected to be taken up by Mr Ng's deputy, Peter Lai 
Hing- ling, given his strong Joint Liaison Group (JLG) 
experience. Equally, Mr Ng, now a full JLG member, could be a 
contender. 
  A more difficult vacancy to fill is the high-powered 
position 
of head of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), 
as the appointee has to be a person of high principle, tough and 
independent-minded while also senior enough to command the 
respect of the anti-graft team. Among the senior officials the 
Treasury Secretary, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, is considered to have 
all the qualities to be a leading choice for the ICAC post 
before and after the changeover. 
  But such a possibility will not deprive him of the chance to 
be a candidate for the pre-1997 Financial Secretary post, given 
his experience. Taking over from Mr Tsang before or after 1997 
is expected to be his deputy, Kwong Ki-chi, or the 
Director-General of Industry, Denise Yue Chung-yee, also a 
deputy in the Finance Branch. 
  As it is the Government's plan to get the new team in place 
in early 1996 at the latest, Mr Patten still has time to 
finalise it. China's final decision may depend on Mr Patten's 
choices. Provided China does not appoint non-civil servants to 
principal posts, the membership of the pre- or post-1997 
leadership will not differ much, as the choices are rather 
limited. 
  On both lists, would-be leaders are expected to include 
Secretary for Trade and Industry, Chau Tak-hay, Secretary for 
Recreation and Culture, James So Yiu-cho, Secretary for 
Transport, Haider Barma, Commissioner for Transport, Rafael Hui 
Si-yan, Director of Education, Dominic Wong Shing-wah, Director 
of the New Airport Projects Co-ordination Office, Billy Lam 
Chung-lun and head of the Government's Geneva trade office, 
Joseph Wong Wing-ping.

  [Text] Two former senior government officials were named 
yesterday to offer their expertise on government affairs to 
China's working panel overseeing Hong Kong's 1997 transfer. 
Arthur Garcia, the first ombudsman in Hong Kong, and Wilfred 
Wong Ying-wai, former deputy secretary for civil service, are 
among a group of 13 appointed by the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee to join the 57-member Preliminary Working 
Committee (PWC). 
  The new members include eight from Hong Kong and five from 
the mainland. The total membership of the PWC has been boosted 
to 70, minus Liu Yiu-chu, who had earlier quit. Officials 
earlier promised to increase the membership of the PWC amid 
fierce criticism over its lack of credibility and dearth of 
dissenting views. The new batch of the think-tank, however, 
remains dominated by mainland officials and pro-China figures. 
  The five mainland members come from the Hong Kong and Macao 
Affairs Office, the local headquarters of Xinhua (the New China 
News Agency) and the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG), 
which falls under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry. 
Mainland officials admitted that the expertise of senior 
government officials was desperately needed in their work. "We 
always hope that more former government officials will take 
part. But there are practical difficulties for some," one said. 
  The appointment of Wilfred Wong, who has helped arrange 
private dialogue between serving colleagues in the bureaucracy 
and local officials from Xinhua, is significant. Mr Wong said 
last night that his previous service in the Government would 
help him to give constructive advice to the Chinese Government. 
Mr Garcia, a retired High Court judge who was later named as 
the Commissioner for Administrative Complaints, will offer legal 
advice to the working panel, which has suffered from the 
shortage of legal experts. 
  Although the Hong Kong Government does not allow any civil 
servants to brief PWC members, an Executive Councillor said they 
would not object to Chinese JLG members briefing the panel or 
even letting them read the documents as long as they could be 
kept confidential. 
  Another local legal expert appointed to the panel is Ambrose 
Lau Hon-chuen, who is also convenor of the preparatory committee 
for the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, a political party to be 
launched by the end of next month. Mr Lau said he would 
definitely join the PWC's legal sub-group to help in 
scrutinising existing Hong Kong laws and to bring them in line 
with the Basic Law. 
  Two academics -- Ng Ching-fai, dean of the science faculty 
at 
Baptist College, and Woo Chia-wei, a vice-chancellor of the Hong 
Kong University of Science and Technology -- were also 
appointed. Also included were two businessmen; Paul Cheng 
Ming-fun, an executive committee member of the influential 
Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, and Philip 
Wong Yu-hong, who represents the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in 
the Legislative Council and is also a member of the New Hong 
Kong Alliance. 
  The publisher of the pro-China Hong Kong Commercial Daily, 
Lee Cho-jat, was also named to sit on the panel. 
  Topping the list of the five mainland members are two 
high-flyers in the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office Zhang Liangdong and Xu Ze -- who were recently promoted 
to head the office's Hong Kong administration department and 
economic department respectively. Mr Zhang and Mr Xu have been 
serving in the secretariat of the PWC since its inception last 
July. 
  Two more local Xinhua officials were also appointed: 
Ulanmulun, a vice-director focusing on economic affairs in Hong 
Kong; and Weng Xinqiao, director of the department of education.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup" by Li Zhigao: "Hong Kong Viewers Complain </F>
About Poor TV Programs"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Hong Kong people have 
more and more TV sets but a growing number of viewers are 
complaining about the poor quality of TV programs and the grave 
competition among local TV stations. 
  A survey by the broadcasting authority reveals that more 
individuals consider the portrayals of violence, sex, nudity, 
triad rituals, triad jargon, and homosexuality on commercial 
television unacceptable. 
  Compared with 1990, four times as many viewers reportedly 
thought the quality of drama series was low, three times as many 
thought the same about children's programs and eight times as 
many thought cultural and arts programs were poor. 
  Recently, the number of viewers' complaints are on the rise 
as two local TV stations -- the Television Broadcasts Limited 
(TVB) and the Asia Television Limited (ATV) -- clashed with each 
other by screening the same episode of the drama series "Judge 
Bao" at the same time. 
  One hundred such complaints have now been received, compared 
to an average yearly total of 800 for all programs, said David 
Webb, secretary of the broadcasting authority. 
  The survey also found that more than 90 percent of those who 
responded consider it necessary to retain the option of the 
imposition of financial penalties by the broadcasting authority 
for breaches of ordinances related. 
  The broadcasting authority has decided to call together the 
two TV competitors to find a solution to the problem and 
legislators have warned to look at what conditions, if any, 
could be added to the companies' licenses, which come up for 
their mid-term review next month. 
  While many TV programs were complained about, the news 
programs of local TV stations became the only exception to be 
praised for high quality by most of the 2,000 respondents in the 
survey. 
  Nearly all individuals aged between 12 and 64 have 
television 
sets in their households in Hong Kong and 30 percent of them own 
two or more television sets. 
  In addition to the TVB and ATV, each of which has both 
Cantonese and English channels, satellite and subscription 
televisions were also introduced to the territory in 1991 and 
1993, respectively, by the Star TV and the Wharf Cable Limited. 
  Statistics show that local residents here tend to spend less 
time on average watching commercial, wireless television, from 
4.2 hours per day in 1990 to 3.5 hours per day this year.

  [Text] Lhasa, May 16 (CNS) -- Chairman of the Tibet 
Autonomous Region government Mr. Gyaincain Norbu, speaking in 
the 2nd session of the Standing Committee of 6th Regional 
People's Congress, said that Tibet would further strengthen 
infrastructural construction on energy, transport and 
communications this year in a bid to increase the strength for 
development of the national economy. 
  The chairman added that the boosting of the infrastructural 
construction had to go further to arouse enthusiasm for 
investment of various kinds in order to step by step create 
diversification of investment and various channels for capital. 
Talking of construction on infrastructural facilities, Mr. 
Gyaincain Norbu said that the budgetary fixed asset investment 
for the region this year rose by RMB [renminbi] 50 million over 
last year. The money would be used to ensure construction on 
key follow-up items and those which have already been 
construction [as received] including a power plant, highways 
between China and Nepal, between Qinghai and Tibet and between 
Sichuan and Tibet, restoration to an airport and comprehensive 
development of water conservancy items. 
  Infrastructural construction carried out in 1993 in the 
region proceeded smoothly and the fixed asset investment 
completed was put at RMB 1.59 billion. The expansion project of 
the Gonggar Airport was completed and the main runway of the 
Bangdag Airport was basically finished. Planned sections of the 
Sichuan-Tibet highway and that between China and Nepal were 
completed. Communication facilities are under rapid 
construction with programme control telephones available in 
seven cities and prefectures. Construction on about 61 earth 
stations for satellite communications were basically finished 
and some of them went into trial operation. Continuous 
improvement of infrastructural facilities in the autonomous 
region make investment environment better and boost contacts 
with places outside the region and even with foreign countries 
for strengthening economic development.

  [Text] Lhasa, 15 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the second 
session of the Sixth Autonomous Regional People's Congress held 
here today, Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional Government, said: "Tibet's economy is continuing to 
develop, its political situation has stabilized further, and 
nationality unity continued to strengthen. New progress has 
been made in all social undertakings, and the general situation 
is good." 
  The second session of the Sixth Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress solemnly opened this afternoon in the Autonomous 
Regional People's Hall. Deputies from all areas and all fronts 
and of all nationalities in Tibet attended the session. All 
Autonomous Regional Political Consultative Conference delegates 
who participated in the second session of the sixth meeting of 
the Autonomous Regional Political Conference on 13 May attended 
the session as nonvoting members. Gyaincain Norbu, who was 
reelected chairman of the autonomous regional government last 
year, gave a report on the work of the government on behalf of 
the regional government and accepted the comments of the 
participating deputies. 
  Reviewing government work, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: 
Over the past year, governments at all levels have adhered to 
economic development as the central task, have closely rallied 
around the goal of establishing a socialist market structure, 
and have deepened reform, opened up wider, and promoted the 
development of the productive forces. In 1993, the region 
achieved a GNP of 3.65 billion yuan, an increase of 8.1 percent 
over the previous year in terms of comparable prices. The 
economies of agricultural and pastoral areas have developed 
steadily. Last year, peasants and herdsmen had a per-capita 
income of 521 yuan, and the production of vegetables, meats, and 
butter basically met the daily needs of urban and rural 
residents. Industry, communications, and production have 
experienced comparatively substantial growth. Infrastructure 
developments with an emphasis on energy, communications, and 
telecommunications have proceeded smoothly, positive trends have 
been maintained for the development of foreign trade and 
tourism, new developments have been made in urban and rural 
market systems, and business and the markets have been brisk. 
New developments have been made in many social undertakings, 
including education, public health, sport, science and 
technology, and culture, and the work on nationality religions 
has been strengthened further. 
  In the government work report, Gyaincain Norbu carefully 
announced: All policies have been implemented. From 1980 to 
the end of 1993, a total of 220 million yuan was spent on this 
implementation, and of that approximately 100 million was spent 
on temples and monasteries. United front, nationality, and 
religion policies have been thoroughly completed, thus 
consolidating and developing a stable and united political 
situation.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yang Zhen (1135 3791)] </F>
  [Text] Lhasa, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- Three years after two 
projects of the first-phase comprehensive program for 
agricultural development were started in Tibet's Pengbo and 
Aimagang areas, construction of the second-phase program -- 
three projects in Lhunzhub county's Pengbo, Bainang county's 
Duqiong, and Gonggar county's Qiongjie -- has been under way 
since the beginning of this year. 
  The second-phase program includes water conservancy, 
forestry, transportation, and energy development projects. It 
is expected that a total of 27.5 million yuan will be invested 
this year, of which 15 million will come from the central 
government. Under the second-phase program, the three projects 
will be built into model farms which have comprehensive 
irrigation facilities and can yield comprehensive results. In 
these model farms there will be fields and gardens; planting 
will be carried in planned zones; farming will be mechanized; 
fine seed strains will be used; and management will be conducted 
in a scientific way. 
  In the past three years since the first-phase program 
started 
at Pengbo and Aimagang, a good situation has emerged in 
development and construction. In these two comprehensive 
agricultural development zones, good-quality water conservancy 
projects have been built; the survival rate of planted trees has 
been high; marked achievements have been made in the 
transformation of medium- and low-yielding farms and in building 
of grasslands; and initial results have been made in improving 
the conditions for agricultural production. Production capacity 
in the two zones has increased to some extent. By the end of 
last year, 48,000 mu of medium- and low-yielding farms had been 
transformed, 43,600 mu of grassland planted with new grass or 
improved, and 15,000 mu of land afforested. This represents 85 
percent of the tasks assigned by the state in the three years.

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren 
yesterday attended a forum held by the provincial party 
committee core theory study group. 
  At the conclusion of the forum, entitled "Emancipate the 
Mind, Brace Up, Carry Out Down-to-Earth Work, and Speed Up 
Development," Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a speech in which 
he emphatically stated: We should strive to integrate 
ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at 
opening up new vistas. To this end, we should persistently and 
unswervingly carry out ideological emancipation and concentrate 
our efforts on removing the following four ideological obstacles: 
  1. The remaining ultra-Left ideological influence that can 
still be found in some areas, units, and comrades across the 
province. Some areas, units, and comrades are still arguing 
about the definition of socialism and capitalism; 
  2. The old concepts from which some comrades have yet to 
ideologically free themselves. Some comrades still find 
themselves more comfortable with the planned economic structure; 
  3. The lack of initiative, enthusiasm, morale, and a strong 
sense of discipline on the part of some comrades. Some areas 
and units are still plagued by slow growth and poor efficiency; 
  4. The habit among some comrades of giving empty talks and 
refusing to do down-to-earth work. Some comrades have even 
adopted an irresponsible attitude toward the party cause. 
  Secretary Liu Fangren noted: We should strive to integrate 
ideological emancipation with down-to-earth work aimed at 
opening up new vistas. To achieve this, we should redouble our 
efforts to push ahead with ideological emancipation in the 
following six areas: 
  1. To firmly bear in mind that "development is the last 
word" and more expeditiously push ahead with overall economic 
growth; 
  2. To further expand opening up to the outside world and try 
to invite more foreign investment; 
  3. To make redoubled efforts to readjust the operational 
mechanism and improve large and medium state-owned enterprises; 
  4. To strive to push forward growth in the non-state-owned 
economic sector; 
  5. To bravely and creatively push forward pioneering work in 
light of actual local conditions; 
  6. To further ideological emancipation in selecting, 
promoting, and appointing more competent cadres and building 
stronger leading bodies. 
  In conclusion, Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: In the months 
ahead, we should devote more energy to the following three work 
areas: 
  1. To closely combine the ongoing general theoretical 
discussion with all sorts of current tasks, and gear the ongoing 
general theoretical discussion to improving all sorts of tasks 
and opening up new vistas; 
  2. To strive to speed up overall growth and mobilize all 
comrades to correctly understand the current provincial 
situation, brace up, strengthen confidence, clearly define a new 
train of thought for the province's overall growth, and put 
forward more proposals aimed at rejuvenating Guizhou and making 
the Guizhou people more prosperous; 
  3. To strive to make flawless work arrangements aimed at 
avoiding unbalanced, superficial, and false growth, and set and 
follow strict work requirements.

platoon level or to a professional technical post at or above 
the junior level, and on whom a commensurate military rank has 
been conferred. 
  According to the nature of their jobs, officers are of four 
categories -- military officers, political officers, logistics 
officers, and professional technical officers. 
  Article 3. In selecting and using officers, we must adhere 
to the principle of appointing people on their merits; ensure 
those selected have both political integrity and ability, and 
have performed well; exchange officers in a timely manner; and 
adopt a democratic supervision system. 
  Article 4. The state decides various remuneration for

  Article 7. Officers must meet the following basic 
requirements: 
  (1) Be loyal to the motherland; willing to wholeheartedly 
serve the people; and able to self-consciously dedicate 
themselves to national defense work.

post at the regimental and division level should have been 
trained at an intermediate-level command academy; and those who 
are at a command post at or above the army level should have

the training courses. Or, graduates of institutes of higher 
learning other than military academies, and professional 
technical personnel may be recruited and appointed officers. 
During wartime, soldiers, drafted reserve service officers, and

  Chapter III. Evaluation, Appointment and Removal of 
Active Service Officers 
  Article 10. The principal leading officers and political 
organs at various levels should evaluate officers under their 
jurisdiction according to the principle of division of work with 
individual responsibility. 
  The method of integrating the evaluation of officers by both 
leading officers and the masses should be adopted in 
evaluations. It is necessary to evaluate officers in an 
all-around way in accordance with the basic conditions for

Central Military Commission, with their actual work performances 
as the main basis for evaluation. The results of evaluations

  [Text] Chongqing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Chairman of 
China's Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing urged the 
country's defence industry to produce more civilian products and 
well adapt itself to a socialist market economy. 
  Liu made the call during his inspection tour of defence 
industrial enterprises in Sichuan Province. 
  China's defence industry began to shift to civil production 
more than ten years ago upon the call by Deng Xiaoping. Taking 
advantage of its advanced technology and equipment, the defence 
industry has become a force to reckon with in the process of 
establishing a market economy. 
  Liu Huaqing urged defence industrial enterprises to seize 
the 
current opportune moment and take further steps to readjust 
their structure, lower costs, renew their products and make 
themselves highly responsive to market demand. 
  He also urged these enterprises to improve the living and 
working conditions of the workers, who have made major 
contributions to the country under very harsh conditions. 
  Liu also visited Chinese people's liberation army and armed 
police stationed in Sichuan, urging them to improve the quality 
of officers and men and actively support local economic 
development.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Guo Jia (6753 0857), and XINHUA </F>
reporter Zheng Guolian (6774 0948 5114) and correspondent Zhang 
Zhimeng (1728 2535 3718)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou 
Military Region held a ceremonial gathering this afternoon to 
mark the 30th anniversary of the Defense Ministry's naming of 
the "Steel Eighth Company in the South Sea Outpost." 
  Inscriptions for the steel eighth company from Jiang Zemin, 
Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen were read at the meeting. 
  Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] General Political Department, presented a copper 
horizontal board engraved with the words "Steel Bastion in the 
South Sea Outpost" to the company on behalf of the three General 
Departments. 
  A general order of the military region party committee 
conferring a first-class merit citation on the company was also 
read at the meeting. 
  In his speech, Chi Haotian, Central Military Commission 
[CMC] 
member, state councillor, and defense minister, first extended 
warm congratulations from the CMC and three General Departments 
to the company. He said: The steel eighth company has grown to 
maturity under the kind concern and assiduous training of the 
party Central Committee, the CMC, and older-generation 
proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao met cordially with 
the company's representatives to National Day celebrations on 
six occasions. CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin, during his inspection 
of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone on 24 June 1990, wrote an 
inscription for the company. Recently, CMC Vice Chairmen Liu 
Huaqing and Zhang Zhen also penned inscriptions for the company. 
In the past three decades, the company has lived up to the 
expectations of the party Central Committee and CMC, always 
preserving and developing the army's fine traditions and 
constantly strengthening its construction in an all- around 
manner. It has stood erect at the outpost in the South Sea with 
a healthy image of mighty and civilized troops and made 
important contributions to safeguarding and building the special 
economic zone. 
  Chi Haotian said: Currently China is at a crucial historical 
juncture. We must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up 
wider, promote development, and maintain stability, wherein lies 
the overall interests of the work of the whole party and whole 
country. The PLA, as the pillar of the people's democratic 
dictatorship, must serve and be subordinate to these overall 
interests by carrying out the sacred mission of safeguarding 
national security and ensuring safe milieus for reform, opening 
up, and modernization. In the face of the heavy responsibility 
entrusted upon us by the times, all army officers and men should 
foster a steel conviction and will toward the cause of the party 
and army. The steel eighth company's spirit reflects precisely 
and vividly such conviction and will. Energetically displaying 
the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit put forth by 
chairman Jiang Zemin, the company has always acted like a steel 
knife whose blade cannot be turned both during the years of war 
and socialist construction -- invincible when assaulting or 
defending against fully armed enemy forces; determined and never 
wavering in the great cause of reform and opening; and rejecting 
corrosive influence and never tainted by offensives of decadent 
ideas and sugarcoated bullets. So long as we develop the eighth 
company's spirit, we will be able to adhere to the party's basic 
line for 100 years and steadfastly advance reform, opening up, 
and the socialist modernization drive; and will be able to carry 
out difficult and rigorous training for crack troops and 
continually improve their fighting capability to meet combat 
requirements. We must learn from the steel eighth company's 
advanced experience and develop its noble spirit, and must 
strive to turn the PLA into a stronger and more modernized 
revolutionary regular army. 
  In his speech, Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong provincial 
committee, lauded the eighth company as heroic troops with a 
glorious tradition. He said: The steel eighth company 
epitomizes the PLA's feature in our times, demonstrating that 
the people's army is an invincible and civilized army. The 
company's footprints symbolize the army's exploits, showing that 
the people's army not only had an illustrious yesterday but has 
continued to and will create a brilliant today and tomorrow. He 
urged local governments to emulate the company in further 
promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization and 
the development of reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  In his speech, Shi Yuxiao, Guangzhou Military Region 
political commissar, called on all commanders and fighters of 
the military region to learn from the eighth company; to arm 
their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics; to inherit and carry 
forward the army's fine tradition of hard struggle; to always 
bear in mind the army's fundamental duties; to train hard for 
tough military skills; to strive to strengthen the construction 
of party branches; and to mold a "fighting bastion." 
  Leaders of Guangdong Province, the Guangzhou Military 
Region, 
and Guangzhou and Zhuhai cities attended the meeting.

  [Text] Guangzhou, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Addressing Guangzhou 
Military Region's conference on work among grass-roots units 
today, State Councillor and Defense Minister Chi Haotian 
stressed that it is necessary to standardize and guide army 
building in grass-roots units by resolutely adhering to the 
requirements -- "All army units must be qualified politically 
and competent militarily. They must have a fine workstyle, 
maintain strict discipline, and be assured of adequate 
logistical support" -- set forth by Jiang Zemin, chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, so as to raise army building among 
grass-roots units to a new level. 
  Chi Haotian said: These remarks were made by Comrade Jiang 
Zemin when he spoke at the All-Army military work conference at 
the end of 1990. They embody Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on 
army building in the new period; reflect the objective law 
governing army building among grass-roots units; spell out the 
basic condition our Army must have in order to fulfill its 
historical mission in the new period; and represent the general 
call for strengthening army building made by the party Central 
Committee -- the third generation leading collective -- with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, and is also a general call for 
strengthening army building among grass-roots units. 
  Chi Haotian said: The whole Army should use these 
"five-point remarks" by Jiang Zemin to standardize and guide 
army building among basic-level units; they should also use them 
to unify their thinking and guide their work. The masses of 
cadres and soldiers, especially leading cadres at various 
levels, should understand them clearly and act upon them 
consciously. Every grass-root unit should do its work in 
observance of the requirements set forth by these remarks. In 
this way, the process of army building among grass-roots units 
will become a process of implementing requirements. He pointed 
out: To fulfill these requirements, it is necessary to do a 
great deal of hard and meticulous work on a long-term basis. 
Leading organs at all levels and every grass-roots unit must be 
prepared to perform first-grade tasks and build first-class 
companies, to create a situation in which everyone suggests ways 
and means for company building and performs meritorious deeds 
for the company; to build more and better companies; and to 
nurture outstanding soldiers. 
  Chi Haotian pointed out: In doing their work, Army 
grass-roots units should act upon the requirements -- "arming 
people with scientific theories, guiding people with correct 
public opinion, fostering people with a noble spirit, and 
inspiring people with outstanding literary works" -- set forth 
by Comrade Jiang Zemin; focus on the fundamental task of 
training soldiers who cherish lofty ideals and moral integrity, 
and who are well educated and self- disciplined; and strengthen 
the building of spiritual civilization by concentrating on 
raising the ideological and moral quality of officers and men. 
Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in studying 
Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping; arm 
themselves with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and his thought on army building in 
the new period; conduct extensive education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism among army units; bear in mind the 
Army's purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly; be firm in 
their ideals and faith; and foster a revolutionary outlook on 
life and values. Leading cadres should launch activities to 
learn from heroes and models like Lei Feng, Su Ning, and Xu 
Honggang, and strive to practice and disseminate new socialist 
morality and customs. In building spiritual civilization, 
leading cadres should take the lead in setting an example and 
strive to influence and promote, with their good images, the 
building of spiritual civilization among Army units.

<F P=106> [From Europe editor David Wallen in London] </F>
  [Text] China has admitted for the first time to world 
shipping authorities that "a few law enforcement officers" may 
have been involved in smuggling and other incidents along the 
coast -- but it claims some reports of piracy are "groundless 
and very irresponsible". Smuggling has now become "rampant" 
along the coast, it admits in a paper, presented to the 
International Maritime Organisation (IMO), but it says it has 
investigated all incidents and, according to Chinese sources, 
they were "very complicated". 
  The Maritime Safety Committee of the IMO will meet between 
May 16-24 in London to consider what steps to take next in 
combatting the growing menace of piracy in the region. Around 
80 of the 149 members states are expected to attend, with China 
sending a team from Beijing. Hong Kong, which has associate 
status within the organisation, will send a team headed by Derek 
Hall, a former director of the Marine Department. 
  According to the IMO, piracy in the region is still on the 
increase, with 42 incidents reported in the east and south 
regions of the China Sea in the seven months to the end of last 
year -- out of 67 worldwide. IMO findings show 20 of them along 
the coast north and south of Shanghai, with the majority of the 
rest around the Philippines. Several countries have submitted 
papers to the IMO, often detailing particular incidents. 
  But in a statement indicating what some will see as an 
official reluctance to be too frank, the Chinese paper says: 
"The manifestations of the incidents were varied. Therefore it 
is not proper to regard all these incidents as 'pirate attacks' 
without investigation and evidence. 
  "Some of the acts were fishermen's disputes; others were 
misconduct by a few law enforcement officers while discharging 
their duties. The misconduct cases have been seriously 
investigated and proper action has been taken by the Chinese 
Government. 
  "However, such incidents were very rare, and should not be 
exaggerated as acts of piracy and there should be a clear 
distinction between such acts and the policy of the Chinese 
Government." 
  The Chinese Government has never commented on smuggling or 
piracy to the IMO in the past but in its paper it gives an 
assurance: "The Government will as always take effective 
measures to curb and suppress any unlawful activities 
(smuggling, piracy and armed robbery) which may sabotage peace 
and order." 
  It says some incidents "were normal law enforcement 
activities carried out by the Chinese law enforcement 
departments against foreign smuggling vessels". 
  China does not mention Hong Kong but it adds: "The reactions 
in this regard were different. Some of the normal 
anti-smuggling activities were maliciously labelled as piratical 
acts." The paper claims some incidents may have been caused by 
what it describes as "black ships" disguised as Chinese vessels. 
China and Japan had been co-operating in the investigation and 
suppression of such incidents. 
  It adds: "Some reports and statistics regarding the 
incidents of piracy in China's coast were groundless and very 
irresponsible. 
  "The Chinese Public Security Force is a highly disciplined 
and law abiding force. 
  "The Chinese navy is also a highly disciplined and armed 
national defence force and usually does not participate in 
anti-smuggling activities at sea, not to mention the possibility 
of robbing ships."

  [Text] Geneva, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Foreign ministers from 
the United States, Russia and five European Union (EU) member 
countries today urged the warring parties in Bosnia to stop 
fighting and resume negotiations to seek a political solution to 
the Bosnia crisis. 
  The foreign ministers were holding here a meeting on the 
Bosnia crisis, which ended today. The five EU nations are 
France, Britain, Germany, Belgium and Greece. 
  A statement issued after hours of talks here this afternoon 
urged the three warring parties -- Serbs, Muslims and Croats -- 
to reach a four-month truce and resume talks unconditionally 
within two weeks. 
  The cessation agreement should include separation of the 
warring armed forces, withdrawal of heavy weapons and 
supervision of the proposed ceasefire by UN peacekeepers, it 
said. 
  It stressed that the division of Bosnian land should be 
based 
on the proposal put forward by the EU -- 51 percent to the 
Bosnian Croat-Muslim Federation and 49 percent to Bosnian Serbs. 
  The statement said it backs bosnia in continuing to exist as 
a country which will define in the constitution relations 
between the Bosnian Serbs and the Croat-Muslim Federation. 
  It ruled out any possibility of lifting international 
sanctions against Yugoslavia before a peaceful settlement of the 
Bosnia crisis. 
  Any attempt to make the lifting of sanctions a precondition 
for resumption of talks is unacceptable, it noted, adding that 
only after the peace plans are implemented, can phased lifting 
of sanctions be considered. 
  The co-chairmen of the international conference on the 
former 
Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were also 
invited to the Geneva meeting. 
  Speaking at a press conference following the meeting, U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the 
international conference on the former Yugoslavia will continue 
to play an important role. 
  He admitted that major obstacles remain toward the 
settlement 
of the Bosnia issue. 
  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe agreed with Christopher 
and added that France will have to consider troops withdrawal 
from Bosnia if all parties refuse any peace proposal. 
  Talking about the arms embargo on Bosnia, Christopher said 
the United States hopes to see the embargo still observed. The 
U.S. Senate voted Thursday to urge the government to cancel its 
arms embargo on Bosnia. 
  Commenting on the Geneva meeting, Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic [name as received], who is attending an 
international seminar on the Bosnia issue in Spain, told Radio 
Belgrade today that without active participation by all the 
Bosnian warring parties, it is impossible to settle the Bosnia 
crisis. 
  He said the Bosnia crisis has become a serious threat to 
peace in the whole of Europe. 
  "It is impossible to resolve the Bosnia issue without active 
participation by the three warring parties in Bosnia, without 
equal treatment, without the removal of dual standards and 
without participation by Yugoslavia," he stressed.

<F P=106> [Report by Wang Genbao and Chen Yong: "Syria Not Convinced </F>
of Israel's Proposals"] 
  [Text] Damascus, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Syria welcomed American 
endeavors for peace in the Middle East but said the Israeli 
proposals U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher carried 
here were vague and insufficient. 
  Christopher is shuttling between Syria and Israel to advance 
the Middle East peace process, especially the peace talks on the 
Syrian-Israeli track. 
  He arrived here Sunday [15 May] and left this afternoon for 
Israel after talks with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. 
  Diplomatic sources here said Christopher briefed Syria on 
Israel's response to the Syrian questions and reservations 
concerning the Israeli formula of peace which he had conveyed to 
Syria during his visit last month. 
  Israel proposed a phased pullout from the Golan Heights 
along 
with security arrangements to be worked out by Syria and Israel. 
  The sources said that Syria deems the Israeli replies vague 
and insufficient as they do not include a clear reference to 
Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan which the Jewish state 
has occupied since 1967. 
  Syria has rejected the principle of gradual pullout but it 
was reported that it might be ready to negotiate a timetable for 
Israeli withdrawal. 
  The sources said that Christopher proposed the formation of 
a 
joint Syrian-Israeli military committee to work out security 
arrangements on the Golan Heights. 
  He also proposed the formation of a similar committee to 
work 
on water distribution and the start of the normalization process 
at the first stage of the Israeli pullout from the Golan. 
  However, Syria insisted on Israel's commitment to full 
withdrawal according to a definite timetable, saying that 
normalization of relations will be discussed by the end of the 
last stage of the withdrawal. 
  The Syrian sources stressed that full withdrawal is the only 
way to achieving comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel. 
  Political observers here said the positions of Israel and 
Syria are still far apart, but there might have been some 
progress in the discussions of some essential issues which can 
be a start for reaching compromises.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Yang Shulin (2799 2885 2651): "Why the </F>
United States and Britain Insist on Imposing Sanctions Against 
Iraq"] 
  [Text] It has been learned that, the UN Security Council 
is going to review the oil sales embargo on Iraq in the middle 
of this month. On this issue, the United States and Britain do 
not agree with countries such as France and Russia. The former 
two are in favor of continuing the oil sales embargo, while the 
latter maintain that, since the Iraqi Government is cooperating 
with UN weapon inspectors and showing some progress in its 
attitude, lifting the embargo should be considered. 
  The oil sales embargo on Iraq was an important part of the 
overall sanctions against Iraq imposed by the UN Security 
Council when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Oil is the 
main source of Iraq's foreign exchange income and an important 
underpinning of the national economy. Cutting off its oil sales 
channels undoubtedly spells disaster to the recovery and 
development of Iraq's national economy and its people's 
livelihood. 
  To solve its predicament and break the blockade, Iraq has 
repeatedly called for the Security Council to end the sanctions 
and has adopted a positive, cooperative attitude in accepting 
the United Nations' destruction of its long-range missiles and 
chemical and biological weapons, as well as the organization's 
long-term supervision of its ordnance production. Not long ago, 
Iraqi culture and information minister Hammadi made a public 
statement to the outside, saying that Iraq has long dropped its 
territorial claim on Kuwait, and the Iraqi National Assembly has 
also withdrawn its decision to annex Kuwait, which was approved 
by Iraq's supreme power organ, the Revolutionary Command Council. 
  It was in the hope that the Security Council would end its 
sanctions against Iraq at an early date that Iraq made those 
efforts and took those positions. What is worth mentioning here 
is that the Security Council initially also cited the 
above-mentioned conditions, stating that, as long as Iraq could 
meet those requirements in its behavior, it would lift the 
sanctions. The relevant sources pointed out: The efforts Iraq 
has made in the above-mentioned areas have reached and satisfied 
the conditions set down by the Security Council at that time; 
therefore, lifting the oil sales embargo should be considered 
and Iraq should be released. France argues that the Security 
Council must stand by the agreement. In other words, once 
Baghdad has satisfied the requirements raised at that time, the 
oil embargo should end. At present, the Iraqi side is launching 
a new diplomatic offensive and is sending out important 
officials in all directions to explain that Iraq's efforts have 
met the requirement for scrapping the sanctions, thus putting 
pressure on the Security Council. 
  But the United States and Britain have taken exception to 
the 
positions of France, Iraq, and other relevant parties. They 
have ignored all dissenting views and have insisted on 
continuing the oil embargo against Iraq, splitting opinion on 
the matter. Some say that Iraq deserved the sanctions earlier 
because it had invaded Kuwait and was in the wrong, but, now 
that Iraq has admitted defeat and bowed to justice, if one again 
made a futile effort to convince people with one's arguments or 
was actually scheming about something else, it would indeed be 
absurd. [sentence as published] 
  The Western media pointed out: The Americans want to use 
sanctions to stop the Iraqi Government from persecuting the 
Kurdish people and the southern Shiite Muslims in the country, 
but the oil embargo resolution did not cover these issues. It 
is common knowledge that the Kurdish and Shiite Muslim problem 
is purely Iraq's internal affair.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- State Councillor and 
Defense Minister Chi Haotian met here this morning with 
Brzezinski, former U.S. national security adviser, and 
Oksenberg, a former high- ranking officer of the U.S. National 
Security Council and president of the East-West Center of the 
United States. 
  Chi Haotian said: China attaches importance to its relations 
with the United States and hopes that the spirit of the 
Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle will be carried forward. It is not 
strange that differences exist between the two countries. So 
long as both sides adhere to the principle of equality and 
mutual benefit and of respecting each other, Sino-U.S. relations 
will certainly be improved and developed. The development of 
friendly and cooperative relations between China and the United 
States is not only beneficial to both sides but is also 
beneficial to stability in the Asia- Pacific region. Turning to 
China's military strategy, Chi Haotian said: China's armed 
forces are defensive in nature, serving economic development. 
China poses no threat to any country. 
  Brzezinski spoke highly of China's achievements in economic 
development, believing China is an important factor for 
stability in the world. He said current difficulties between 
the United States and China are transitional in nature, that the 
strategic interests of the two countries are long-term ones, and 
that the American people's friendship for the Chinese people is 
sincere. He expressed the hope that China and the United States 
will continue to work hard to stabilize and develop bilateral 
relations. He said he is optimistic about the prospects of 
Sino-U.S. relations. 
  The U.S. guests came at the invitation of the Chinese 
People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
said here today that China will never seek any sphere of 
influence or hegemonism in the world and resolutely opposes any 
country that tries to resort to hegemonism and power politics 
against China. 
  The Chinese premier made the remarks during his meeting with 
Zbigniew Brzezinski, former U.S. presidential national security 
adviser here today. 
  He said that China will not export its own ideology nor its 
concept of values; neither will it allow any country to impose 
its ideology or concept of values on China. 
  China respects the internal affairs of other countries and 
will never allow any other country to attempt to interfere in 
China's internal affairs and detract China from its own road of 
development, he stressed. 
  Li said that China's present policy and road of development, 
which are based on prolonged efforts of exploration and 
practice, conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese 
people. 
  The premier said that great changes has taken place in the 
world since Brzezinski's previous visit to China more than six 
years ago. 
  China takes economic development as its central task and 
pursues a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping 
the initiative in its own hands, Premier Li Peng said, and these 
should be the basic starting point for foreign observers to 
understand China. 
  "Foreign statesmen will surely make mistakes in their 
decision- making if they base their understanding of China 
merely on the words or views of a tiny number of Chinese to the 
ignorance of the interests and wishes of all other Chinese 
people," the premier said. 
  Li said that China's development and growth in its strength 
constitute an important factor contributing to world peace, 
adding that in international exchange, China strictly observes 
the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, posing no threat 
to any other country or provoking any disputes or confrontation. 
  On Sino-U.S. relations, Li said he appreciated President 
Clinton's attitude of hoping to see a powerful, stable and 
prosperous China and the Chinese Government hopes that Sino-U.S. 
relations will gradually improve and develop. 
  Brzezinski said that China is a very important country, both 
regionally and globally, and it is a major factor for world 
stability. 
  He believed that a closer U.S.-Sino relationship would be 
good for both countries and this fact cannot be changed by the 
differences between them. 
  Expressing his happiness with China's progress in its 
foreign 
relations, Brzezinski said that he had carefully studied Premier 
Li's recent speeches concerning China's policy of developing 
relations with four Central Asian countries, and he believed the 
policies were of universal significance. 
  From a long-term point of view, he said that he was 
optimistic about the future of U.S.-Sino relations, which will 
occupy a most important position in the U.S. foreign policy. 
  Prior to the meeting, Premier Li Peng gave a brief interview 
to CBS reporter Constance Yu-hwa Chung and answered her 
questions on U.S.-Sino relations.

<F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Chen Dawei (7115 1129 4850): </F>
"Clinton Faced With Decision on Problem of China's 
Most-Favored-Nation Status"] 
  [Text] New York, 15 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- U.S. 
President Clinton is facing an important economic and diplomatic 
decision. 
  He must decide before 3 June whether or not to extend 
China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, which, as the date 
nears, is becoming a hot issue in the media here. 
  Calls for the revocation of China's MFN status this year are 
more subdued than a few years ago. An increasing number of 
people of perception are voicing their support for the 
continuance of China's MFN status and favor delinking the MFN 
issue from the so- called human rights issue in order to solve 
this "thorny issue," which troubles the U.S. Government every 
year, once and for all. 
  Businessmen and industrialists, the people who are most 
realistic, are asking the Clinton administration to take 
China--the world's biggest market--seriously and face up to the 
fact that China's economy is developing rapidly. They believe 
that, in the interests of the enormous U.S. commercial stake in 
China, the Clinton administration should continue to grant China 
MFN status. 
  It is understood that close to 1,000 U.S. companies have 
written to President Clinton urging him to extend China's MFN 
status. John (Hayden), vice president of the Boeing 
Corporation, which sold 47 Boeing airplanes to China last year, 
said that the effort to keep the rapidly developing Chinese 
market open to the United States is most important to ensure the 
U.S.' leading position in international commercial aviation and 
other sectors. 
  Many American businessmen went further in pointing out that 
if the U.S. Government made a wrong decision on the issue of 
extending China's MFN status, Sino-U.S. relations would 
seriously deteriorate [yan zhong dao tui 0917 6850 0227 6622], 
and the United States would pay dearly for this. Many 
well-known business executives have also raised doubts about the 
whole entanglement of the so-called China human rights issue. 
(Gerlinberger), chairman of the board of directors of the 
American International Insurance Corporation, said that pinning 
the entire foreign policy on one issue, the human rights issue, 
was neither reasonable nor sensible. 
  Many in the U.S. Congress have sobered up to reality. 
Hatfield, a Republican senator from Oregon, pointed out in an 
earlier report that American consumers would pay $10 billion 
more each year and some important U.S. firms would see their 
interests damaged if China's MFN status was revoked. Lee 
Hamilton, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
also said a few days ago that China's MFN status should be 
extended. 
  At present, there are indeed some people inside and outside 
Congress who stubbornly persist in linking MFN status with the 
so- called human rights issue. It has been suggested that 
before China can satisfy the terms set in the presidential 
executive order signed by Clinton last year, the United States 
should, while extending China's MFN status, apply selective 
trade sanctions on China, that is, restricting imports from 
state-owned enterprises by withholding trade privileges from 
them. However, the media generally think this simply will not 
work. 
  Reports in the media here say that the White House is 
working 
furiously to get President Clinton out of this "self-inflicted 
trap." People hope that this President, like the late former 
President Nixon, can focus on overall U.S. interests and the 
long- term strategic interests between the United States and 
China and make a wise decision on the issue of China's MFN trade 
status.

  [Text] Washington, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Disruption in 
U.S.-China trade relations would cost American consumers more 
than 10 billion dollars annually and deal a serious financial 
blow to several key U.S. industries, a study by the 
Congressional Research Service warns. 
  The study, requested by the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee and released by Senator Mark Hatfield here 
Wednesday [11 May], also concludes that possible retaliation by 
China would have profound economic and employment consequences 
for those states which now rank among the highest in exports to 
China, including Washington, California, Texas, Florida and 
Louisiana. 
  The report takes no position on the renewal of MFN 
[most-favored nation] status for China, but Hatfield, a ranking 
member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the 
document "offers an authoritative appraisal of the economic 
implications of that question." 
  "China will experience phenomenal economic growth in the 
coming years and that will be true regardless of its trading 
status with the United States. This fact cannot be ignored 
during the upcoming debate on MFN renewal. 
  "The findings of this report only heighten my doubt that 
most 
favored nation status is the right tool to use to promote 
democracy in China," Hatfield said. 
  The study, entitled "China-U.S. Economic Relations: The 
Costs to the U.S. of Withdrawing Most Favored Nation Tariff 
Treatment and Other Questions", is the first to provide a 
comprehensive analysis, by economic sector and by state, of the 
potential impact of disruption in U.S.-China trade relations. 
It also contains these findings: 
  -- Termination of China's MFN status would not only mean a 
loss of that market for certain U.S. industries, but would have 
a domino effect by reducing the competitiveness of those 
industries in other global markets. 
  -- Annual review of China's MFN status has posed a 
continuing 
risk for U.S. companies doing business in China not faced by 
other foreign firms in China. 
  -- From 1990 to 1993 U.S. exports to China increased by over 
82 percent while exports to Japan and the European Union fell. 
China went from being the 12th largest purchaser of U.S. 
transportation equipment to the 3rd, an increase of nearly 200 
percent compared with only a 3 percent increase from the rest of 
the world. 
  -- China is the United States' number one market for 
fertilizer and a top market for road vehicles, 
telecommunications equipment and various types of specialized 
machinery. 
  The release of the study, three weeks before U.S. President 
Bill Clinton has to decide whether or not to renew China's MFN, 
is seen as an increase of pressure on the White House to handle 
the matter in a way that best serves the interests of American 
consumers and businesses.

  [Text] Governor Chen Huanyou met with Dr. Kissinger, 
former U.S. secretary of state who is on a visit to Suzhou, on 
the morning of 14 May. The two had a warm and friendly 
conversation. 
  Chen Huanyou welcomed Kissinger's visit. He said: Dr. 
Kissinger is a far-sighted politician. Some 20 years ago, as an 
assistant to then U.S. President Nixon, you made major 
contributions to opening the door of Sino-U.S. relations, and to 
promoting normalization of relations between the two nations. 
People in Jiangsu, as elsewhere, will never forget this. 
  Governor Chen briefed Kissinger on his recent visit to the 
United States. Speaking of the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade 
status, Governor Chen said: The United States has capital and 
high technology, while China has a big market. It has always 
been mutually beneficial for the two sides to develop economic 
cooperation and trade. The ongoing annual debate on whether to 
renew China's MFN status is deeply hurting the feelings of 
people in China and the United States. 
  Governor Chen expressed the hope that Dr. Kissinger will use 
his influence and make contributions to the development of 
Sino-U.S. friendship, economic cooperation, and trade. 
  Dr. Kissinger thanked Governor Chen for receiving him in 
spite of his busy schedule. He said: I have deep feelings for 
China. Our friendship is built upon common interests. 
Cooperation between our two nations should grow constantly. 
  After hearing with interest Governor Chen Huanyou's briefing 
on Jiangsu's investment environment and development of bilateral 
investment in economic cooperation and trade, Kissinger said he 
would work hard to promote U.S. investment in Jiangsu. 
  Suzhou Mayor (Zhang Xisong) and others were present at the 
meeting.

  [Text] New York, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Jiangsu provincial 
trade and investment fair opened today at Suxing International 
Trading Company Limited, Manhattan, New York. 
  The fair was jointly organized by the Jiangsu Provincial 
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Commission, the Foreign 
Economic Relations and Trade Commissions of Nanjing and five 
other cities, various import and export companies in Jiangsu, 
and Suxing International Trading Company Limited. 
  More than 200 people, including Jiangsu Provincial Governor 
Chen Huanyou and the Jiangsu provincial economic and friendly 
delegation led by him; and Zhang Weichao, Chinese consul general 
in New York attended today's opening ceremony. 
  It has been learned that Jiangsu's foreign trade has been 
developing rapidly in recent years with import/export trade 
reaching $8.7 billion in 1993 -- a 39.3 percent increase over 
the preceding year -- of which foreign trade export volume 
accounted for $5.976 billion, an increase of 27.95 percent over 
1992. On the other hand, the province has also made great 
progress in attracting foreign funds with accumulated approval 
of over 20,000 foreign-invested enterprises by the end of 1993, 
involving contractual and actually used foreign funds amounting 
to $19.7 billion and $2.847 billion, respectively. 
  In the evening, Governor Chen Huanyou and others attended a 
welcome dinner party hosted by Overseas Chinese and Jiangsu 
natives in New York.

Chinese economic development and he was happy with the

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (AFP)--China is a foreign policy 
priority for Moscow, although domestic differences exist on the 
approach to certain China-related issues, a senior Russian 
parliamentarian said here Monday. 
  Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian parliament's lower 
house 
emphasised the importance Moscow attaches to Sino-Russian ties, 
but added that some deputies had opposing views on the questions 
of border visas and applying the Chinese economic model in 
Russia. 
  Many Russian deputies are believed to be in favour of visa 
restrictions to stem the flood of people crossing the 
Sino-Russian border daily. Some 2.5 million people crossed the 
border last year and Moscow has expressed concern over the 
number of Chinese in Russia. 
  While Rybkin praised China's economic success, he stressed 
that Russia could not always follow the same path, especially as 
it did not have the support of a similarly wealthy overseas 
community. Rybkin, who is heading an 11-member parliamentary 
delegation, met Monday with President Jiang Zemin and Vice 
Premier Li Lanqing, with whom he discussed the planned visit to 
China later this month of Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin. 
  After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning 
of 
the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in 
1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. 
  Since Boris Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 
following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing 
have enjoyed close military cooperation. 
  Rybkin also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to 
participate in several large-scale construction projects in 
China, including the massive Three Gorges hydro-electric dam 
being built on the Yangtze River.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Developing cooperative 
relations with China is the top priority of Russia's diplomatic 
policy, said Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian State Duma, 
here today. 
  He told a press conference this afternoon that recent years 
had witnessed frequent high-level exchanges between the two 
countries, and the two-way trade volume was 30 percent more in 
1993 than the previous year. 
  He said that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Stepanovich 
Chernomyrdin would bring a long list of projects to China for 
attracting investments during his upcoming China visit. 
  The chairman added that he and his colleagues had held good 
meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Chinese 
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today. 
  The two countries shared the view that they had many common 
interests in the fields of economy, trade and culture, he said.

  [Text] Moscow, May 15 (XINHUA) -- Armenian Deputy Defense 
Minister A. Petrosyan said that a peace agreement could be 
signed this week on the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the war 
in the enclave may end this year. 
  Petrosyan told a press conference in Ereven on Saturday [14 
May] that the defense ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia and 
the military leader of Nagorno-Karabakh were going to meet under 
the Russian defense minister's mediation in Moscow on Monday. 
  Petrosyan expressed his belief that a peace agreement would 
be signed after three days of the meeting. 
  The military leaders attending the meeting are to discuss a 
time table for sending peace-keeping forces to the 
Nagorno-Karabakh region and sites of their deployment. 
  Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous region technically within 
Azerbaijan, is populated largely by Armenians. 
  A separatist movement began in 1988, leading to the 
declaration of an independent republic in the region in 
September 1991. 
  A senior Azerbaijani official disclosed last Saturday that 
during the four years of conflict an estimated 20,000 
Azerbaijanis have been killed and a further 50,000 maimed.

  [Text] Kiev, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk has urged the country's new parliament to postpone the 
presidential election scheduled for June 26. 
  In a letter addressed to Parliament, Kravchuk explained that 
an early presidential election has no legal foundation and will 
only intensify political conflicts and worsen the economic 
situation. 
  He proposed that the new parliament should instead draw up a 
new constitution, or a presidential law, and a local Soviet law 
to provide legal basis for the elections. 
  After the new parliament was elected, about 120 people's 
deputies called for a postponement of the presidential election. 
Some political parties and organizations have also made similar 
appeals out of different considerations. 
  The UKRINFORM NEWS AGENCY quoted Kravchuk as saying that 
intense campaigning will only intensify political conflicts 
between different parties. 
  The president said in the letter that an early presidential 
election could undermine state control over the economy and made 
it even more difficult to overcome political crisis and to carry 
out economic restructuring. 
  Kravchuk wrote the letter after the new parliament failed to 
discuss the postponement of presidential election in its first 
day of business. He had made similar calls before. 
  Meanwhile, the Central Election Commission has announced 
four 
qualified presidential candidates including President Kravchuv, 
and said it will proceed with the work of presidential election 
as scheduled.

  [Text] Moscow, May 15 (XINHUA) -- A peacekeeping force of 
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), consisting mainly 
of Russian troops, will move into the security zone between 
Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia by the end of may, 
INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported today. 
  Under a Russia-brokered agreement on cease-fire and 
disengagement of the two sides' forces, both Georgian government 
troops and armed Abkhazian separatists are to be pulled back 12 
kilometers from the Ingur River to create a 24-km-wide buffer 
zone where the Russian peacekeepers will be deployed. 
  The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the 
region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to 
return home, the Russian Government said after the signing of 
the agreement yesterday in Moscow by representatives of the 
Georgian Government and the rebels after talks through the 
mediation of Moscow. 
  They will resume negotiations in Geneva next month on the 
status of Abkhazia. 
  Formerly an autonomous republic in Western Georgia on the 
Black Sea coast, Abkhazia in July 1992 declared independence 
from Georgia, a move bitterly denounced by the Tbilisi 
government. 
  Government troops moved into Sukhumi, capital of Abkhazia, 
the next month, and war flared up. Last year, Abkhazian 
separatists drove the Georgian troops out of the region and 
Tbilisi asked Moscow to intervene in the conflict. 
  Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old 
conflict which is still going on despite the mediation of Moscow.

  [Text] Moscow, May 14 (XINHUA) -- Representatives of 
Georgia and the country's breakaway region of Abkhazia, brokered 
by Russia, signed here today an agreement on cease-fire and 
disengagement of their forces in the conflict area. 
  The Russian Government said in a statement that it was 
satisfied with the steps taken by Georgia and Abkhazia to ensure 
peace in the region. 
  The statement also said peacekeeping troops from the 
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) will be deployed in the 
security zone to be established under the agreement. 
  The security zone will help prevent the conflict in the 
region from erupting again and create conditions for refugees to 
return home. 
  The Russian Government expressed the hope that both sides 
would fulfil their own obligations and that it was willing to 
promote, together with the United Nations, a comprehensive 
solution to the conflict in the region. 
  Georgia's economy has suffered a lot in the 22-month-old 
military conflict between government forces and Abkhazian 
separatists, who last year drove the Georgian troops out of the 
region on the Black Sea coast.

Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai Municipal CPC 
Committee, met with a Ho Chi Minh City party and government 
delegation led by Vo Tran Chi, member of the Political Bureau of 
CPV Central Committee and secretary of Ho Chi Minh City Party 
Committee, at Xijiao guesthouse on the afternoon of 14 May. 
During the meeting, Wu Bangguo briefed the Vietnamese visitors 
on Shanghai's development. 
  Wu Bangguo said: Shanghai adheres to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
persistently carries out reforms, and opens itself wider to the 
outside world. In recent years, its economic development has 
been better than anticipated. 
  Wu Bangguo pointed out: On the road of advance, Shanghai 
persistently takes economic construction as its central task; 
builds both material and spiritual civilizations, and attaches 
equal importance to both; and assumes an overall point of view 
in handling the relationship between development and stability. 
  He said: Shanghai keeps to a socialist orientation and 
places emphasis on two things: One is to maintain the 
predominance of public ownership. The other is to maintain the 
predominance of the system of distribution according to work and 
taking the road of common prosperity. 
  Wu Bangguo said: Shanghai is eager to promote cooperation 
between the two cities. The two cities are mutually 
complementary to a great extent in economic development. 
Shanghai is willing to strengthen its cooperation and exchanges 
with Ho Chi Minh City in the economic, trade, and scientific and 
technological fields. 
  Vo Tran Chi expressed his admiration for Shanghai's 
development. He hoped that the two cities would develop their 
cooperation and exchanges rapidly.

<F P=106> [BY reporter Zhang Rongdian (1728 2837 0368)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- A decade has passed in 
the development of China's nuclear undertakings and nuclear 
safety supervision and administration since it started building 
the Qinshan and Daya Bay nuclear power plants in the 1980's. 
  During this period, China has built a very efficient nuclear 
safety supervision and administration system. An international 
regulatory review mission from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency [IAEA], a working visit to China recently, concluded that 
China's nuclear safety supervision and administration system 
conforms to the standards of usual international practice. 
  Huang Qitao, director general of the National Nuclear Safety 
Administration [NNSA], which is an independent government 
department with jurisdiction over nuclear safety supervision and 
administration, said in an interview with this reporter: The 
fact that China -- young is terms of nuclear energy development 
-- is able to attain the level it has achieved today in nuclear 
safety supervision and administration can be attributed to its 
active participation in international cooperation. 
  He stressed: China is positive, open-minded, and unreserved 
when it comes to promoting international cooperation and 
exchanges in nuclear safety. NNSA has signed agreements on 
cooperation in nuclear safety with the United States, France, 
Italy, Spain, Pakistan, Germany, and Japan. It has also 
maintained regular contacts and conducted exchanges with a 
number of countries with which no such agreement has been 
signed. China will also sign agreements on cooperation in 
nuclear safety with a number of other countries. 
  Huang Qitao said: In regard to nuclear safety supervision 
and 
administration, China has received generous support from the 
United Nations Development Program [UNDP], IAEA, EC, and other 
international organizations. They have provided China with 
technical training, information, computer software, and other 
data relevant to the safe operations of nuclear plants. He said 
China has also taken an active part in international cooperation 
in nuclear safety under the auspices of the IAEA, including the 
entire processing of drafting of the "International Convention 
on Nuclear Safety" under IAEA sponsorship. China will fulfill 
all the obligations provided in the convention when it is signed. 
  Huang Qitao said: China has gained a great deal of valuable 
experience from its active and frequent participation in 
international cooperation and exchanges. It has also made its 
experience available to other countries without any 
reservations. For this reason, all participants are 
beneficiaries of international cooperation in nuclear safety. 
He noted that China will step up its efforts in international 
cooperation on nuclear safety and take an active part, as ever 
before, in international cooperation sponsored by the IAEA. 
  Annick Carnino, head of the international regulatory review 
mission, also noted in an interview with XINHUA while she was in 
China: The IAEA will strengthen cooperation with China in 
nuclear safety supervision and administration and provide 
assistance, to the extent possible, in making preparations for 
dealing with nuclear emergencies.

  [Text] Beijing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- China has built a very 
effective nuclear safety administration system during the past 
10 years when China started its construction of the Qinshan 
Nuclear Power Plant and the Guangdong Daya Bay Nuclear Power 
Plant in the '80s. 
  During a recent visit to China, the International Regulatory 
Review Team (IRRT) of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) agreed that China's nuclear safety administration system 
reached the standards of usual international practice. 
  China's progress in this area is closely related to its 
active international cooperation, according to Huang Qitao, 
director general of China's National Nuclear Safety 
Administration (NNSA). 
  He said that China's attitude towards international nuclear 
safety cooperation and exchanges is active, open and unreserved, 
adding that NNSA has signed cooperative agreements with a number 
of countries while maintaining regular contacts with some other 
countries having no such agreements with China. 
  Huang noted that China has received support from some 
international organizations such as the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP), IAEA and the European Community, 
which provided China with materials, computer software, and 
information concerning safety in nuclear power plants. 
  He said that China also takes part in international 
cooperations of IAEA including the drafting of the International 
Nuclear Safety Convention, and China is ready to discharge all 
obligations when the convention is signed. 
  In an interview with XINHUA, Ms. Annick Carnino, head of the 
IRRT of the IAEA, said that IAEA will strengthen its cooperation 
with China in nuclear safety administration and is ready to 
provide China with help in nuclear emergency planning and 
response.

  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The "Comprehensive Study 
of the Prediction and Appraisal System for the Development of 
Basic Subjects of Study" [ji chu xue ke fa zhan yu ce he ping 
jia xi tong zong he yan jiu -- 1015 4342 1331 4430 4099 1455 
7315 3261 0735 6097 0116 4762 4827 4844 0678 4282 4496] -- a 
major project of the Seventh Five-Year Plan financed by the 
State Natural Science Fund -- recently passed an evaluation 
examination in Beijing. Experts in this field have said that 
the project was developed in setting sights on the management of 
and the policy on basic research; that, in carrying out the 
project, researchers conducted pioneering and systematic study 
and a theoretical summation of priority science fields; and that 
the overall standard of the project is among the most advanced 
in China. 
  How to decide the priority of and to appraise scientific 
research projects is one of the central issues in formulating 
policy on scientific and technological development. As the 
science sphere continues to expand, we must first conduct a 
scientific appraisal of those key basic research projects that 
are relatively mature and that have an overall impact on and 
serve as a driving force for economic, scientific, and 
technological development before we concentrate our efforts on 
making breakthroughs in key issues. For this reason, over the 
past three years and more, the group undertaking the project -- 
led by Professor Chen Yuxiang, a state- level middle-aged 
scientist -- conducted a large amount of studies and analyses on 
the scientific selection of basic research projects, finally 
enabling it to establish a set of theories and a system for 
appraising basic research projects. At the same time, the group 
studying specific subjects, in light of the country's policy on 
aiding science and technological projects and of the country's 
resources distribution, conducted substantiated research on the 
structure of specific subjects of study, the metrological 
analysis of scientific output, the theory on the budgeting and 
distribution of funds, and the formulation of scientific 
development strategies and achieved fruitful results. 
  When accepting the project, experts said the project not 
only 
was theoretically innovative and has filled the gap in this 
field in China but that it also has provided a new method that 
can be used as a reference in formulating policy on scientific 
and technological development, as well as provided a large 
amount of information. In conjunction with the country's 
science and technology policy and management, the project has a 
very important application value for selecting key technologies. 
The popularization and development of the project will provide 
a new means for further improving the coordination between the 
country's science and technology resources and the state's 
development objectives.

  [Text] Shanghai, 16 May (XINHUA) -- China's largest VSAT 
[very small aperture terminal] satellite communications network 
on 9 May passed evaluation and acceptant test in Shanghai's New 
Pudong District. The modern center which houses the large 
satellite communications network is not only a successful 
pioneering undertaking in Pudong's construction but also in the 
history of international communications construction. 
  Erected at the southern end of the principal satellite 
communications network building is a magnificent parabolic 
antenna 12 meters in diameter, pointing directly to the blue 
skies and aiming precisely at the No. 5 Zhongxing communications 
satellite at 115.5 degrees east longitude over the equator. 
  The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network can provide 
such communications services as data, speech, image, and 
facsimile transmission. Among the first group of subscribers to 
the network are the Eastern Airlines' booking system, XINMIN 
WANGBAO's layout transmission system, and the Shanghai Grain and 
Oil Exchange's quotations broadcast and transactions return 
systems. The grain and oil exchange's quotations and 
transactions returns can be transmitted within 0.5 second and 
are being used widely in various parts of the country. The VSAT 
satellite communications center provides two options of network 
grouping: a star-shaped PES [expansion unknown] network which 
transmits mainly data and can also be used for transmitting 
speech, and a net-shaped TES [expansion unknown] network which 
transmits mainly speech and can also be used for transmitting 
data. It is understood that the center is the first in the 
world to have the configuration of such comprehensive, 
multi-purpose equipment, which has reached the world's advanced 
level in terms of both technology and equipment. 
  The Pudong VSAT satellite communications network was built 
with funds jointly raised by the Shanghai Science and Technology 
Investment Company, Jinqiao Export Processing Zone, and three 
other development zones.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Academy of 
Sciences (CAS), the largest national research institution in 
China, today offered 144 new technological advances on the 
market. 
  The new achievements, involving machinery and electronics, 
chemical industry, energy, agriculture, new materials, bio- 
engineering and other industries, represent China's latest 
progress in these fields. 
  CAS vice-president Wang Fusong said today that the 
technologies are chosen from among those developed by its 123 
research institutes nationwide. 
  The offer is part of CAS's efforts to make better use of 
technological achievements and provide new technologies for 
enterprises. 
  In order to meet the country's increasing demand for 
technology, CAS changed its research strategy in 1992 by 
concentrating a considerable number of its scientists on applied 
technological research and application or commercialization of 
their technological achievements. 
  The vice-president said that during the past two years, 
about 
500 enterprises have been set up by CAS, utilizing their 
research achievements and establishing technological cooperation 
with about 3,000 other enterprises over the country, which has 
produced huge economic benefits. 
  "All 144 achievements have been compiled in one CAS 
reference 
guide, and in the future CAS will regularly publish such a book 
containing its technological achievements, which will serve as a 
bridge for technological transfer between the research 
institutes and enterprises," said Wang.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 15 (XINHUA) -- The building of a canal 
has started in Pizhou City in east China's Jiangsu Province, for 
discharging floodwaters from the Yihe, Shuhe and Sihe Rivers, 
all tributaries of the Huaihe River. 
  The three rivers flow over an area of 78,000 sq [square] km 
in southern Shandong Province and northern Jiangsu Province, a 
region which is a major supplier of grain and coal in east China. 
  Government sources said the completion of the project will 
raise the canal's flood-discharge capacity to 5,500 cu m [cubic 
meters] per second. 
  The project, part of the national program to control 
flooding 
on the Huaihe River, will cost more than one billion yuan, which 
will be financed by Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces, said the 
sources. 
  Meanwhile, another flood control project was also started in 
Guoyang County, Anhui Province, on the Baohuihe River, another 
tributary of the Huaihe River with a drainage area of 2,930 sq 
km. 
  The project will involve the dredging of the river channel 
and the building of locks, bridges and pumping stations on the 
river, which, local sources said, will enable the area to resist 
severe floods. 
  The project is supported by a national agricultural 
development fund.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- China's reform and 
development of state-owned enterprises is proceeding well and 
the production and business of the enterprises have been 
improved, according to Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State 
Economic and Trade Commission. 
  Addressing the 1994 China Beijing International Summit 
Economic Forum, Minister Wang said the profits made by 
state-owned enterprises have increased remarkably and the 
percentage of enterprises with general debility has dropped. 
  Calculated in terms of comparable factors, Minister Wang 
said, the total output value of the state-owned enterprises in 
the first four months of this year was 4.7 percent more than 
that in the same period of last year. The rate of increase in 
April even reached 5 percent. It is merely hearsay that a large 
percentage of China's state-owned enterprises have stopped or 
slashed production. 
  According to a poll in 16 provinces and municipalities, 
about 
10 percent of the state-owned enterprises are idle or operating 
at under full capacity at present and only four percent have 
stopped production, Minister Wang said. 
  In areas like Beijing, he stressed, the percentage of 
enterprises which stopped production is even lower -- two 
percent. 
  He pointed out that in a big country like China, it is 
normal 
during the process of economic reform and development that a few 
enterprises are temporarily shut down or scaled back or in 
seasonal movement. Moreover, most of these enterprises are 
medium-sized or small ones and such enterprises are mainly in 
the textile and coal industries. Besides, most of the 
enterprises have fallen into such a difficult position because 
of burdens existing long before. 
  Minister Wang said that there have been various factors 
causing the enterprises to be shut down or scaled back. It is 
mainly because some industries already have a glut of products 
and their products are unwanted on the market. In addition, 
some of the enterprises have had problems in management. Some 
were shut down, or suspended operation, or were amalgamated or 
switched to the manufacture of other products according to the 
state policy on industries or because of the readjustment of the 
enterprise organizational structure, or because of needs to 
upgrade city facilities. 
  To counter the hearsay that the percentage of state-owned 
enterprises with general debility has been increasing and the 
amount of loss has risen, Minister Wang said that it is a 
misunderstanding. 
  He explained that in order to meet the needs of establishing 
a socialist market economy, state-owned enterprises started in 
last July to adopt a new accounting method under which interest 
on loans, additional wages, bonuses and other fees which used to 
be disbursed from the profits of the enterprises are now 
disbursed from the costs. Meanwhile, more funds should be used 
in technical renovation and the enterprises are allowed to raise 
the depreciation rates of their equipment. These regulations 
are beneficial to the expansion of the enterprises' power of 
self-management and to long-term development of the enterprises. 
However, the enterprises' book profits are reduced. As a 
result, some enterprises which used to make little profit have 
turned into loss-making enterprises. But the actual efficiency 
of the enterprises has been raised. 
  If calculated by the old method, Wang said, the total 
profits 
made by state-owned enterprises in the first three months of 
this year would increase by 50 percent compared with the same 
period of last year to reach 19.1 billion yuan including 11 
billion yuan of expenditure for equipment depreciation, loan 
interest, bonuses, education funds and other fees and 8.1 
billion yuan in book profits. 
  Wang also pointed out that the percentage of enterprises 
with 
general debility was calculated by the number of enterprises. 
Since most of the loss-making enterprises are small and 
medium-sized ones, the absolute amount of the output value of 
the enterprises and their amount of loss is not big. 
  He stressed that if different measures are taken for 
different enterprises, the problem of enterprises showing losses 
can be solved. For those enterprises with problems in 
management, it is necessary to deepen the reform to transform 
the management mechanism and establish a modern enterprise 
system to turn from deficits to profits. He revealed that the 
departments concerned under the State Council and governments at 
various levels are actively taking measures to solve the 
problems. 
  Wang also said that the State Council has recently 
readjusted 
the policy of credit, allowing the banks not only to support 
those state-owned enterprises with good efficiency but also to 
support the production of the marketable products of those 
enterprises with general debility. However, he stressed, it is 
not allowed to support the production of unwanted products. 
  Wang added that the banks will also offer loans to meet the 
basic needs of the daily lives of the employees of the 
enterprises at loss. However, he said, the local government 
should also offer some financial subsidies to jointly maintain 
social stability. 
  As for those enterprises which have long registered losses 
and have no prospects for recouping the losses, Wang said, they 
will go bankrupt according to the insolvency law.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- By the end of this 
century, China will finish the construction of a major 
telecommunications network composed of 16 trunk optical cable 
lines, which will cover all the provincial capitals, and become 
connected with the world's network. 
  Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, said 
today that the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) for 
telecommunications development has been initially drafted. He 
said that in the new plan priority is given to construction of 
long-distance optical cable networks. 
  According to major targets set in the plan, the ministry's 
total business volume will have an annual average increase rate 
of 23.7 percent, while the annual average increase rate for its 
business income will be 24.2 percent. 
  Wu said that fulfillment of the plan will bring the national 
telephone capacity from the present 42 million lines up to 140 
million lines, and the national telephone availability rate will 
reach eight percent, while that for urban areas will reach 30-40 
percent. 
  In addition, mobile telephones will cover all the country's 
large and medium-sized cities, as well as most of the towns, 
basically realizing national automatic roaming. 
  The ministry will establish its own air postal route and 
improve other postal facilities to shorten mail delivery time. 
Meanwhile, computer networks will be established for EMS 
[electronic mail system] inquiry, issuing of publications, 
postal management, postal deposit and other business. 
  Posts and telecommunications have been experiencing the 
fastest development among all the country's industries in the 
past few years. Last year its increase rate reached 59 percent, 
exceeding the development speed of the national economy for the 
ninth successive year. An official from the ministry predicted 
that this year the sector will maintain a development speed of 
about 50 percent. 
  To ensure that the targets set in the plan be fulfilled, the 
ministry has drafted a huge budget of 360 billion yuan for the 
construction of posts and telecommunications infrastructures. 
  At present China's telecommunications capacity ranks seventh 
in the world; if all these targets are hit, it will be able to 
edge into the world's first three positions.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The size of the overseas 
personnel employment in China should be about 300,000 to 500,000 
by the turn of the century, which will account for 0.2 to 0.3 
percent of China's total workforce of 150 million people. 
  This is the employment proportion set preliminarily by the 
Chinese Government for overseas personnel by the year 2000, 
according to Wang Dongyan, a senior official with the State 
Labor Ministry. 
  According to the official, China will balance and readjust 
the total number of overseas personnel employed in various 
regions in light of the economic development and the labor 
supply and demand in various localities. 
  He mentioned the necessity of strictly limiting the 
employment of non-technical personnel and other ordinary 
laborers from overseas, for China is very populous and has huge 
redundant labor resources. 
  The labor official noted that only those with special skills 
and managerial personnel who are in short demand in China can be 
employed. On no account should localities exceed the employment 
quota set by the government. 
  The state's labor departments will also decide on the list 
of 
industries and types of work which overseas personnel are 
allowed to take on. 
  The official stressed that overseas personnel should be 
banned from employment in industries and departments which 
concern national defense as well as national security. 
  In addition, the official said, overseas employees should 
get 
"employment permits for overseas personnel" before being allowed 
to settle in China.

    [Editorial Report] JINGJI CANKAO BAO carried a ten-part 
series of articles on "Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried 
Out by the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation" on 19-22 
and 24-29 April 1994. All the articles except part seven, which 
is not attributed, are written by JINGJI CANKAO BAO reporter Yu 
Huiyin [0151 6540 7299]. Part one of the series is carried 
immediately under the masthead and the rest are carried in other 
places on page 1. The main contents of these articles are as 
follows: 
  1. "Reform Is Aimed at Development--Enlightenment Gained 
From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation (Part One)" 
  The article begins by saying: "Seizing the opportunity to 
deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, promote 
development, and maintain stability is the general task of the 
whole party and the whole country. Reform and opening up are 
the motive force for development, development and reform are the 
foundation for the long-term social stability of the country, 
and maintaining social stability is the prerequisite for 
developing the economy and deepening reform." The article says 
that development and reform are interdependent and that "it is 
impossible to speed up development without speeding up reform." 
"Reform should center closely round development and should 
regard contradictions, difficulties, and hot spots emerging at 
deeper levels in economic development as key points." 
  The article further says: "The most valuable thing of the 
experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in 
carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms is that it 
has firmly grasped some most pressing problems in development 
and steadily carried out reforms to gradually solve theses 
problems and promote development." In view of its difficulties, 
the corporation "put forward the basic train for thought for 
carrying out comprehensive and coordinated reforms--`increase 
the value of assets, relocate enterprises, change functions, 
transform mechanisms, and make arrangements for surplus 
workers,'--clearly put forward the target of preserving and 
increasing the value of state-owned assets, focused attention on 
comprehensively enlivening the state sector of the economy 
instead of just individual state-owned enterprises in an 
isolated manner, carried out reforms comprehensively instead of 
item by item, and seized the opportunity to change structures 
and mechanisms." The article then mentions the corporation's 
achievements in increasing output value, sales volume, profits 
and taxes handed over to the state, and workers' income. 
  In conclusion, the article says: "It should be pointed out 
that damaging the fundamental interests of the state and people 
should not be the price for development. The problem of serious 
losses of state-owned assets cannot be solved without reform. 
How to carry out reform? Can we rely entirely on selling 
state-owned assets to foreign businessmen and individuals? Can 
we blaze a new path by mainly depending on the strength of the 
state sector of the economy, reallocating resources and 
production factors, and reforming and changing the operational 
mechanism, while guaranteeing the rights and interests of the 
proprietors of state-owned assets, preventing loss of 
state-owned assets, and guaranteeing the property rights of 
enterprise legal persons as pointed out in the decision made at 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee? 
These questions are worthy of constant exploration by people 
including those of the Beijing First Light Industry system." 
  2. "Make Advancement as a Whole, Make Breakthroughs at Key 
Points--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Two)" 
  The article says: "To continue to deepen reform, we must 
resolve contradictions at deeper levels. However, various 
contradictions at deeper levels, which are intertwined, mutually 
affected, and mutually conditioned, cannot be resolved with 
reforms or readjustments carried out item by item." 
  The article says the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation 
has similar contradictions to resolve and tells how it has 
resolved them: "It has organically integrated many items of 
reform, including optimizing the production setup, changing 
functions of government departments, changing operational 
mechanisms of enterprises, training and placing surplus workers, 
and establishing a modern enterprise system, and has pushed 
forward reforms of state enterprises in a comprehensive and 
coordinated manner. It has taken the enlivening of the state 
sector of the economy as the center and of stock assets as a 
point for making a breakthrough, and has increased the value of 
state-owned assets." 
  In the end, the article tells how the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation has succeeded in enlivening state-owned 
enterprises in only one year: "The Beijing First Light Industry 
system has shifted its efforts from enlivening individual 
enterprises to enlivening state-owned assets, from carrying out 
reforms item by item to carrying out comprehensive and 
coordinated reforms, and from maintaining the traditional 
enterprise system to establishing a modern enterprise system so 
that state enterprises reorganize themselves in market 
competition and generate new and greater vitality." 
  3. "Planning Leads to Economic Results--Enlightenment Gained 
From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation (Part Three)" 
  The article first says: "Comprehensive and coordinated 
reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light Industry system 
have been based on the `Beijing General City Construction 
Plan.'" According to this plan, the article says, "the role 
played by tertiary industry in promoting the national economy 
will become more and more evident. It is also possible to make 
full use of limited land resources and to increase their 
input-output rate.... To optimize the layout of the city, it is 
necessary to gradually shift the focus of city construction from 
urban areas to distant suburban areas and counties and to 
develop city construction and to shift from extension expansion 
to readjustment and transformation. The Beijing First Light 
Industry system has precisely proceeded from this local reality, 
endeavored on its own initiative to meet the objective needs of 
readjusting the economic structure and developing tertiary 
industry as mentioned in the General City Construction Plan, and 
put forward the development strategy of relocating secondary 
industry enterprises and developing tertiary and secondary 
industry at a high level in suburban areas beyond the Fourth 
Ring Road." 
  Then the article gives details of how "the Beijing First 
Light Industry Corporation carried out comprehensive and 
coordinated reforms, taking the enlivening of state-owned stock 
assets including land resources as a point for making a 
breakthrough." The article tells how the corporation moved its 
enterprises out of urban areas and constructed office buildings 
and residential quarters in former factory premises to develop 
tertiary industry. 
The article calls for learning from the experience of the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation in attaching importance 
to planning. In conclusion, the article says: "In carrying out 
experiments at selected points on comprehensive and coordinated 
reforms, various localities should do so under the unified 
leadership of respective local governments and with unified 
planning, and such experiments should be organized in a unified 
manner. All the planning for development of various trades and 
professions should be included into the general plan for local 
city development." 
  4. "Enlivening Stock Assets Is a Big Issue--Enlightenment 
Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation (Part Four)" 
  The article begins by saying: "The characteristics of the 
comprehensive and coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing 
First Light Industry system are proceeding from putting property 
rights relationships in order, operating and developing 
state-owned assets in accordance with the needs of the market 
economy, giving play to the role of differential benefits of 
land resources, optimizing the allocation of resources, and 
ensuring a constant increase in the value of state-owned assets 
to strengthen the state sector of the economy. Some people 
thought that the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry 
system is mainly the development of real estate. They did not 
correctly understand its basic experience and basic train of 
thought." 
  The article goes on to give an account of how the 
corporation's Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited 
developed real estate and used the money obtained to relocate 
plants, develop secondary industry at a high level, train 
qualified personnel, and develop tertiary industry, which 
provided lots of jobs for surplus workers. 
The article then says: "Enlivening state-owned stock assets 
is a point for making a breakthrough in the comprehensive and 
coordinated reform carried out by the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation. The connotation of stock assets is very 
broad. It includes various tangible and intangible assets. 
Enlivening state-owned stock assets is not confined to 
readjustment of the direction of use of land, but also includes 
improving operations, promoting technological progress, 
improving enterprise management, improving the quality of 
workers and staff members, optimizing the combination of 
production factors, and so on. All these can enable existing 
resources to produce greater economy results. The Beijing First 
Light Industry system has, in light of different situations and 
problems of enterprises, explored and adopted various ways to 
enliven stock assets." The article then provides concrete 
examples showing successes of the corporation in this respect. 
  5. "Surplus Workers Are Also Wealth of the 
Society--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Five)" 
  The article says at the beginning: "Making arrangements for 
surplus workers is a prerequisite for the readjustment of the 
industrial setup and enterprise structure and is also an 
important issue which has a bearing on the success of reform and 
social stability." 
  Then the article mentions difficulties in solving problems 
in 
making arrangements for surplus workers and writes about 
effective methods adopted by the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation--establishment of an insurance and compensation 
mechanism for unemployed workers, the pooling of funds for 
training and job assignment of unemployed workers, and the 
establishment of a labor service development company. According 
to the article, the labor service development company ran 14 
kinds of training classes to enable workers to acquire knowledge 
and skills needed for future jobs. 
  6. "Separating Government From Assets Is a Prerequisite for 
Separating Government Administration From Enterprise 
Management--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Six)" The 
article begins by saying that government departments in charge 
of state enterprises should ensure an increase in the value of 
state-owned assets and should also change their functions and 
separate government administration from enterprise management so 
that enterprises can carry out operations on their own according 
to law. 
  The article then gives an important reason why it has 
been so difficult to separate government administration from 
enterprise management: "The government's social and economic 
administration functions have not been separated from its 
function as the proprietor of state-owned assets." The article 
goes on to say that "to separate government administration from 
enterprise management, the government must first be separated 
from assets." According to the article, the Beijing First Light 
Industry system has enthusiastically explored rational forms and 
means of management and operation of state-owned assets 
following the principle of separating government from assets. 
"With the approval of the Beijing Municipal Government, the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which originally 
exercised the function of government administration, has been 
transformed into a company which manages state-owned assets. It 
exercises the function of proprietor of state-owned assets, 
separates government administration from enterprise management 
and investor ownership from the property rights of enterprise 
legal persons. It increases the value of state-owned assets 
through operating them, and gradually separates itself from the 
functions of trade and social management on behalf of the 
government. In addition, it has removed restrictions on 
production and operation enterprises so that these enterprises 
can exercise all rights according to laws of property rights of 
legal persons, carry out operations on their own, and assume 
sole responsibility for their profits and losses." 
  The article also says "there are other forms of management 
of 
state-owned assets, such as establishment of investment 
organizations, foundations, and holdings companies," and 
stresses that the success of such management is determined by 
"whether or not property rights relations are put in order, 
property rights responsibilities are clearly defined, and 
enlivening the state sector of the economy and ensuring an 
increase in the value of state-owned assets are taken as the 
starting point and standpoint." 
  7. "Efforts Concentrated on Bringing Forth New 
Systems--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Seven)" 
  The article begins by saying: "An important standard for 
assessing whether or not a reform is successful is whether or 
not a comprehensive new mechanism is set up." Then the article 
gives examples of how "the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation seized the opportunity of urban transformation and 
the readjustment of the production setup to develop potential 
assets, and regarding this as a turning point, energetically 
readjusted enterprise structures and changed the operational 
mechanisms of enterprises. In developing the land resources of 
former enterprises, "it established a new land use system" and 
"succeeded in increasing the value of state-owned assets." The 
article continues: "Regarding the distribution system, payment 
of wages according to grades is changed into payment according 
to contribution. Regarding the labor employment system, the 
practice of an enterprise taking care of everything concerning 
workers' employment is changed into labor employment based on 
the ability of individual workers." Surplus workers are 
"trained to enhance their skills and to improve their quality so 
they can depend on their own ability to chose, or to be chosen 
for, jobs amid market competition.... The demand on giving play 
to the role of market mechanism runs through various links of 
comprehensive and coordinated reforms." 
  The article gives as an example how the newly organized 
Beijing Match Plant set up new mechanisms at the very beginning 
of operations. "All wages are paid on a piecemeal basis and 
production quotas are set. Pensions and insurance are covered 
by the society.... Enterprises no longer bears the burden 
concerning resignation and retirement of workers.... All workers 
are employed on a contract basis and managing cadres are 
employed by appointment." The article also says the newly 
established Beijing Hongyun Property Investment Company Limited 
"has established an entirely new operational mechanism and a 
standardized management structure, and adopted operational 
practices in accordance with the needs of the market economy.... 
There is no relationship of administrative subordination between 
the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation, which has been 
transformed into a company for managing state-owned assets, and 
the Hongyun Company. The former does not exercise any 
administrative function and as a controlling company, it only 
enjoys benefits according to share rights and uses the rights of 
shareholders to influence the behavior of the latter." 
  In conclusion, the article attributes the successes of the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation to its efforts to 
establish new systems. 
  8. "Rebirth Following a Natural and Unrestrained 
Death--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Eight)" 
  The article mainly recounts the fate of the Beijing Match 
Plant, a plant selected by the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation for carrying out experiments on reform. 
  The plant was an old one set up in the last years of the 
Qing 
Dynasty. It had 868 workers and 500 retired workers. It 
suffered a loss of 2.5 million yuan last year. The plant was 
moved to a rural area and became a joint venture with a local 
enterprise. "The economic results of the new match plant have 
increased as the strong point of having technical personnel of 
an urban enterprise and the strong point of having greater 
flexibility and running at a low cost as a rural enterprise 
supplement each other." A real estate management company was 
set up. The original premises of the Beijing Match Plant have 
been built into a small residential area, and this has increased 
the assets of the company from 10 million yuan to 110 million 
yuan. The company has yielded great economic and social 
benefits and has provided many job vacancies. "Of the 868 
workers of the former match plant, 130 have been transferred to 
the tertiary industry enterprise, 60 technical workers have gone 
to the new match plant, 120 workers retired, and 558 are being 
trained for other posts by the Labor Service Development Company 
according to the needs of the market. The Beijing Light 
Industry System uses part of the benefits obtained from 
optimizing allocation of resources and increasing the value of 
resources to set up a job-waiting insurance system, which 
ensures the livelihood of workers being trained for new jobs, 
supplements funds for training, and guarantees the stability of 
the match plant." 
  The article concludes: "In this way, an enterprise which 
suffered heavy losses was eliminated and two new profit-making 
enterprises were born. Besides, the capacity for producing 
daily necessities was preserved." 
  9. "It Is Also Necessary to Put In Less and Put Out More in 
Reform--Enlightenment Gained From Reforms Carried Out by the 
Beijing First Light Industry Corporation (Part Nine)" 
  The article says "in carrying out reform of the economic 
structure, it is necessary and possible to put in less and put 
out more. This has been proved by the comprehensive and 
coordinated reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation." 
  The article also says: "Practice has proved that enterprises 
are carriers for the movement of capital. If enterprises do not 
establish a mechanism which enables them to consciously seek an 
increase in the value of their assets in accordance with the 
intrinsic demands of the law of value and a modern enterprise 
system which is in keeping with market competition and changes, 
or if they do not carry out comprehensive and coordinated 
reforms in the overall setting of enlivening the entire state 
sector of the economy, it is impossible to fundamentally solve 
the problems of enlivening state enterprises." 
  The article then writes about how the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation succeeded in putting in less and putting 
out more: "The corporation did not depend on tax reduction, 
retaining more profits, or writing off past debts. Instead, it 
regarded enlivening stock assets and increasing the value of 
assets as a point for making a breakthrough, overcame the 
difficulty of the shortage of funds, and created necessary 
conditions for the placement of workers and the relocation of 
enterprises. The placement of workers and the relocation of 
enterprises provided a new opportunity for changes in 
mechanisms, while changes in the functions of government 
departments made it possible to change the mechanism of 
enterprises. Reforms carried out in this way gave expression to 
the unity between enlivening state enterprises and enlivening 
state-owned assets, the unity between the readjustment of 
production relationship and the readjustment of the productive 
forces, the unity between economic results on the one hand and 
social and environmental benefits on the other, and in 
particular, the unity of reform, development, and stability." 
In conclusion, the article says such reforms have "realized a 
greater increase in the value of state-owned assets and are 
conducive to strengthening the state sector of the economy and 
to consolidating the leading position and giving play to the 
leading role of state enterprises in the national economy." 
  10. "Support Comprehensive and Coordinated Reforms in a 
Comprehensive and Coordinated Manner--Enlightenment Gained From 
Reforms Carried Out by the Beijing First Light Industry 
Corporation (Part Ten)" 
  The article begins by saying that "the reforms of state 
enterprises is system engineering. Not only are various items 
of reforms within enterprises interrelated, such reforms also 
involve many aspects of the external environment, including 
putting the property rights relations in order, changing 
government functions, developing the market system, and 
reforming the social insurance system." 
  The article then urges major leading officials of government 
to personally strengthen unified planning for reform and urges 
organizations of various sectors to coordinate. The article 
says: "All departments concerned should proceed from the overall 
situation of promoting the establishment of a modern enterprise 
system, cooperate with one another, and enhance the smooth 
progress of reform. Supporting comprehensive and coordinated 
reforms in a comprehensive and coordinated manner is a demand 
explicitly put forward by the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee 
and the municipal government while giving direct leadership over 
experiments on reforms carried out by the Beijing First Light 
Industry Corporation and is also the successful experience of 
the corporation in making a smooth progress in carrying the 
reforms within such a short time." 
  The article then mentions how Chen Xitong, secretary of the 
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee, Mayor Li Qiyan, and other 
high-level officials handled official business at the Beijing 
First Light Industry Corporation and how the State Commission 
for Restructuring the Economy and committees, departments, and 
offices of the Beijing Municipal Government helped solve 
problems emerged in the reforms. 
  In conclusion, the article urges various localities to use 
the experience of the Beijing First Light Industry Corporation 
as reference and boldly make exploration and carry out reforms.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Yingchun (3769 6601 2504)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- According to the "Plan 
for the Organization, Establishment, and Operation of the State 
Development Bank" approved by the State Council, the People's 
Construction Bank of China has been entrusted to handle the 
payment of policy-leading loans extended by the State 
Development Bank. A proxy-signing ceremony for the business was 
held in Beijing today; the proxy was signed separately by Yao 
Zhenyan, State Development Bank president, and by Wang Qishan, 
president of the People's Construction Bank. 
  The State Council recently gave a formal approval to the 
State Development Bank's establishment. The new bank's 
establishment is an important measure in the reform of China's 
investment system, as well as an important part of the reform of 
the banking system. The State Development Bank, as a 
policy-leading state banking facility, will strive to build an 
investment restraining mechanism and a bank loan risk 
responsibility mechanism. It will create a stable, long-term 
source of funds, raise funds from the society for the 
construction of key state construction projects, guide funds 
from the society into the construction of key state construction 
projects, and control the fund source to regulate the total 
amount and pattern of state investment and to enhance investment 
efficiency. After discontinuing its policy-leading banking 
business, the People's Construction Bank of China will become a 
state commercial bank with medium-term and long-term loans as 
its main business, and it will handle the payment of 
policy-leading loans extended by the State Development Bank. 
  Yao Zhenyan said during the proxy-signing ceremony: It is 
important to find a proper proxy for handling the policy-leading 
loans and the task is very arduous; and I believe that the 
construction bank can do the job well because it is experienced 
in managing fixed assets investment. Wang Qishan said the 
construction bank and the development bank share the objectives 
of promoting reform, supporting key construction projects, 
improving macroeconomic regulation and control, and enhancing 
investment efficiency, and that the construction bank will do 
its best to provide good service and handle well the business 
entrusted to it by the State Development Bank. The two banks 
agreed to cooperate, support, and coordinate with each other, 
and to contribute to bringing about a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy. 
  After a consultation, the State Development Bank entrusted 
the Construction Bank to supervise the execution of loan 
contracts, handle loan and fund payment businesses, supervise 
the use of loans, and assist in recovering loans. The two banks 
reached an agreement on defining their responsibility, rights, 
and monetary business procedures. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were leading comrades of the 
State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the 
Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China.

<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Wage Law To Adjust Pay Scales"] </F>
  [Text] The government is stepping up work on a wage law 
that will set up a national minimum wage and standardize 
industry pay scales. 
  Speaking yesterday at a national conference in Beijing, 
Labour Minister Li Boyong stressed the need to reform the wage 
and wage distribution system. 
  "A market economy does not preclude macro-economic control 
by 
the government," Li said. 
  In the first half of this year, the country's pay rolls are 
expected to grow 25 per cent over the same period last year, the 
minister said. 
  The draft of the wage law includes 10 chapters covering pay 
scales, minimum wage, payment, wage disputes, insurance and 
supervision. 
  It says the State will control all wage-related issues 
through laws, macro-economic means and administrative measures. 
  According to the draft law, wage distribution must follow 
four principles: 
  -- Wage levels should rise based on economic development; 
  -- Pay should be given based on work done; 
  -- Priority must be given to efficiency and fairness; 
  -- Equal pay for equal work. 
  Based on the country's economic growth, unemployment, prices 
and investment, the government will also establish references 
for enterprises when they decide their staff's wages. 
  The minimum wage is to be determined after consultation with 
representatives from local government, trade unions and 
enterprises. 
  It is expected to be more than the local poverty relief 
ceiling but less than the current wage level of the average 
worker, according to the draft law. 
  Shanghai, Guangdong and Fujian already have minimum wage 
laws. 
  The four-day conference will cover labour reform, changes in 
calculating labour statistics and information, and medium- and 
long- term goals for the ministry.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Labor 
Ministry is formulating a system of guidelines for enterprise 
wage increases, which will be put into force in the near future. 
  The system is aimed at ensuring proper wage increases in 
enterprises and further strengthening the government's 
supervision and macro control over wages, said Wang Dongyan, a 
senior Labor Ministry official in charge of the wage affairs. 
  According to Wang, the guidelines will be determined by a 
wage committee composed of three parts from the state's labor 
departments, trade unions and the associations of entrepreneurs. 
  The guidelines will be fixed upon in light of the yearly 
increase rate of social labor productivity and changes in the 
cost of living index for urban residents. 
  At the same time, the guidelines will take into account 
multiple factors which have an impact on wages, such as price 
increases, the standard of labor costs, the labor supply and 
demand in markets as well as foreign trade. 
  The official said that the guidelines will function in terms 
of wage increase ranges and absolute increase amounts. The 
guidelines will be issued in April every year, with an effective 
term of one year. 
  Wang holds that the guidelines for wage increases will help 
to maintain a rational, coordinated proportion between wage 
increases, economic growth and price rises. 
  The effort is one of the important contents of the ongoing 
wage reform in which the market mechanism determines the wages, 
the enterprises enjoy self-determining power in distribution and 
the government practices supervision and macro control over 
wages. 
  According to the official, Chinese workers are now enjoying 
higher wage levels, due to the transformation of the ways the 
enterprises operate and the deepening reform of the enterprises' 
wage system. 
  Official statistics showed that in 1993, the average per 
capita wage of Chinese workers had risen to 3,236 yuan, up 19.4 
percent over the previous year.

Ma Kuijun (7456 7608 0689)] 
  [Text] Tianjin, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- Reporters learned from 
an ongoing national conference on insurance for foreign 
nationals, hosted in Tianjin by the People's Insurance Company 
of China, that our country made rapid progress in promoting 
foreign nationals' insurance last year. According to 
statistics, the People's Insurance Company of China in 1993 
earned $732 million, or 29.8 percent more than in 1992, from 
insurance business catering to foreign nationals. It paid a 
total of $356 million in settlement for losses and its loss 
ratio was 48.76 percent. Twenty company branches which sell 
life insurance in Tianjin, Beijing, and other localities each 
reaped an average of over $10 million worth of insurance 
premiums from insurance business catering to foreign nationals. 
This business again grew in the first quarter of this year, 
yielding tangible social and economic returns. 
  It is understood that since 1993, our country has made 
greater progress in opening up to the outside world, in 
importing technologies, in attracting business and investments, 
and in expanding exports on the north and south of the Chang 
Jiang. Never before has it come across such a scene of 
prosperity in insurance business catering to foreign nationals. 
The People's Insurance Company of China has promptly adjusted 
its way of thinking to catering to market demand, operated 
according to international market practices, and at the right 
moment, set up business in aviation and space insurance, oil 
exploitation insurance, insurance for the three types of partly 
or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, short-term credit insurance 
for commodity exports, seller's contract responsibility 
insurance, and insurance on personal injury caused by accidents 
on domestic flights. 
  At the same time, the company has actively explored overseas 
markets, established the Hong Kong China Insurance (Group) 
Limited Company and the London China Insurance Shareholding 
Limited Company, and set up 71 overseas agencies in Luxembourg, 
the United States, and other countries.

  [Text] Beijing, May 12 (CNS) -- A rising securities market 
and its potential for further exploitation in China have aroused 
the attention of many foreign companies asking for the issuance 
of their shares in the Chinese securities market. The market, 
however, has not yet been opened to foreign companies. 
  The Chairman of the China Securities Committee, Mr Liu 
Hongru, speaking at a confrence on international economic 
affairs held in Beijing said that securities had so far been 
closed to foreign investors mainly because a number of 
preparations have yet to be made including the formulation of 
laws and regulations to govern the listing of foreign companies 
in China. The committee has also to make sure which kind of 
accounting practice is to be employed by foreign companies when 
they are listed in China. Another main point the committee has 
to consider is what kind of foreign companies are qualified for 
listing in China and the supervision of these companies once 
they are listed. 
  Mr Liu stressed that the most important point lay in solving 
the capital problem under circumstances where the renminbi has 
not yet become a convertible currency and the control of foreign 
exchange is still in place in China. Should the renminbi 
possessed by a foreign company or investor not be converted, it 
would lose significance for the floating of shares by a foreign 
investor in China. 
  Seen from the long run, Mr Liu said that the securities 
market and other commodity markets would open to the outside 
world. China is now considering seriously all proposals raised 
by foreign companies. 
  As for the merging of "A" shares and "B" shares, Mr Liu 
noted 
that such a practice had to be based on the convertibility of 
the renminbi and also depended on share prices shown in the two 
markets when such a merging was going to take place. The 
development of the stock market will be centered on expansion of 
the issuance of "B" shares and on the boosting of its mobility 
in a bid to push forward its development. 
  China will continue to select some enterprises to be listed 
overseas, according to Mr Liu. There was the first batch of 
nine state-owned enterprises going abroad for issuance of "H" 
shares on a trial basis last year. About 22 more enterprises 
have been chosen for overseas listing on a trial basis this 
year. They, however, will no longer be listed in Hong Kong, but 
rather some of them will have their shares issued in the United 
States.

<F P=106> [Article by Guang Li from the "Opinion" page: "Shares in </F>
State Firms Are Investors' Best Bet"] 
  [Text] Investors expecting high and stable returns should 
think twice before pouring their cash into China's real estate 
market at the moment, economists warned at a recent seminar in 
Beijing. 
  Those with foresight should instead use this opportunity to 
buy shares in large and medium-sized State enterprises which are 
debt-ridden but promising, said economist Li Yining of Beijing 
University. 
  His view was echoed by the country's other leading 
economists 
and officials at a seminar on Baoan Group's modern enterprise 
system set up. 
  Profits of the Shenzhen-based Baoan Group, the country's 
first enterprise to introduce a shareholding system, soared in 
the past few years thanks to its involvement in real estate. 
  And the real estate industry has enjoyed a great boom since 
Deng Xiaoping reiterated in 1992 that the economy would speed up. 
  As thousands of foreign firms flood the country, the real 
estate sector has grown to such an extent that China seems to 
resemble a vast construction site, with cranes and bulldozers 
everywhere. 
  When inflation hit double digits late last year, the central 
government decided to put the brakes on the economy. 
  Though a soft landing was intended, real estate was hit by a 
slow down in fixed-assets investment. 
  Beijing and Shanghai notwithstanding, the real estate market 
has hit an all-time low. Many domestic and overseas developers 
have difficulties selling million-dollar office buildings and 
luxury villas. 
  "The present situation shows that, though investing in real 
estate is lucrative, it is a risky business," said Dong Fureng, 
honorary director of the Economics Institute of the Chinese 
Academy of Social Sciences. 
  Despite the promise of high profits, businesses expecting a 
stable return on their investment should not spend all their 
money on real estate, Dong said. 
  The best bet for investors is to look to State industries 
for 
good bargains, the economists agreed. 
  And as the country moves from a planned to a market economy, 
many State firms have been cut from government loans and cheap 
raw materials. It's reported that more than one-third of the 
large and medium-sized State enterprises are losing money. 
  Some of the companies are well-equipped and can turn out 
quality products. What they lack is a ready source of capital. 
  Others are staffed by highly-qualified technical and 
managerial personnel, but lack the funds to renovate and improve 
the quality of their products. 
  "This situation has created the best possible opportunity 
for 
big investors to take over industries -- through buying and 
holding shares," said Wang Yuzhao, an economist with Development 
Research Centre under the State Council. 
  But investors face the difficult task of deciding which 
industry to invest in. The economists offered some suggestions: 
  -- Select factories or firms which have a potential for 
further development, said Wu Jinglian, an economist with the 
Development Research Centre of the State Council. Investors 
should not focus on single industries like real estate and 
electronics. Smart ones will carefully study the government's 
investment policies, development plans and the market rules 
before deciding the direction of investment, Wu said. 
  What's more, they will benefit from the research experience 
of Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
  -- Special attention should be paid to the industries or 
trades that are neglected by most investors, suggested Fan 
Hengshan, deputy director of Comprehensive Planning and Trial 
Department under the State Commission for Economic Restructuring. 
  It's always too late to start your engine when others are 
already halfway to the end," Fan said. "To ensure a leading 
position, one has to look for new destinations that are later on 
to be targeted by others." 
  -- A breakthrough can be made in the sections that link 
different industries or trades, Fan said. As the economy 
develops, many new trades and industries will start. Those who 
invest in these industries and trades first will have a good 
chance to dominate them. Some examples are chain stores and 
express mail service. 
  The seminar participants are also optimistic on the future 
of 
investment in the west, which is comparatively underdeveloped 
but boasts rich natural resources. 
  "The fast development along the east coast has a lot to 
attribute to the overseas investment, which on the other hand 
have also benefited the investors a lot," Wang Yuzhao. "Now 
it's time for the enterprises in the east to transfer their 
labour-intensive industries to the western part of the country. 
Such a transfer and investment will benefit both the east and 
the west." 
  Agriculture is another good bet for the investors. 
  Now that agriculture production, especially in the 
southeast, 
is stagnant because a lot of arable farmland has been deserted, 
investors should step in to take over. 
  Considerable profits can be made by developing modern 
farming 
through a combination of planting, breeding and developing 
concerned industries like farming machinery, fertilizer, 
pesticide, feed and processing industries. 
  Agricultural strategies guarantee these investors will enjoy 
long-term preferential policies and farm products can expect a 
burgeoning market now that living standards are finally 
improving, the economists pointed out. 
  Hong Yamin, director of the Real Estate Research Institute 
affiliated to Beijing Economics Institute, however, disagrees 
with the above economists and officials. 
  "The experience of our more developed neighbouring countries 
and regions shows that there should be three to five real estate 
fevers in the process of development," she said. "Whoever can 
survive the temporary low ebb will come out big winners." 
  She suggested, instead of pouring money into the 
foreign-oriented luxury buildings, investors should invest in 
the apartment and office buildings that cater to the needs of 
common folk and domestic enterprises. 
  "There is a huge market in them," she said.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [12 May], while holding a 
discussion with responsible comrades from journalists' centers 
stationed in Gansu by main central press units and with main 
provincial and city news reporting units, provincial party 
Secretary Yan Haiwang pointed out: Press and propaganda work 
must give first play to positive reporting, and exert its main 
effort to rouse the drive of the people to actively guide, 
supervise and promote government work. 
  This discussion was presided over by Sun Ying, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee. (Song Zhaolong), 
member of the standing committee of the provincial party 
committee, was present at the discussion as well. Sun Ying 
said: The provincial party committee has attached great 
importance to the work of our press units, and has pinned great 
hopes on them. We are satisfied with the correct guidance for 
public opinion which is provided by our news reporting and 
propaganda work, and by work done by everyone present over the 
past four months. There have been some marked features in our 
news reporting and propaganda work over the past four months: 
1) We have implemented the spirit of the national and 
provincial propaganda and ideological work meetings. 2) We have 
persisted in correct guidance for public opinion. 3) We have 
grasped typical reporting in a vivid and dramatic manner, and 
have propagated the main theme of the era. 
  Sun Ying also set several specific demands for doing news 
reporting work well. Responsible comrades from the Gausu 
Provincial Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, provincial radio 
and television department, GANSU RIBAO, and other units spoke 
without any inhibition. They talked about their tentative 
working plan for both the present and the near future. While 
listening to their speeches, Yan Haiwang also exchanged views 
with them. When they raised the issue that the masses in the 
Gannan area and the southern part of Gansu have difficulties in 
listening to radio broadcasts owing to poor signal strength, he 
said: This is because of the weak transmitting capacity of our 
broadcasting equipment. The provincial authorities will 
coordinate with the central authorities to solve this problem 
well. 
  Yan Haiwang briefed all the participants on economic 
construction and social development in Gansu Province since the 
beginning of this year. He stressed: The guideline of the 
provincial authorities is that we must further emancipate our 
minds and change our concepts. In the meantime, we must strongly 
advocate self-reliance and hard work. Our province had a poor 
foundation to start with. Our news reporting and propaganda 
work must rouse the drive of the masses and inspire their 
enthusiasm. In our future news reporting and propaganda work, 
we must pay attention to exploring certain questions, devote our 
main efforts to positive reporting and providing active 
guidance, and grasp typical reporting well. We must encourage 
the masses, and arouse their enthusiasm so as to give play to 
the guiding role of news reporting in organizing, encouraging, 
promoting, and inspiring our people.

  [Text] Yesterday, provincial CPC Secretary Zhang Boxing 
addressed the closing ceremony of a theoretical study class for 
leading cadres of the provincial democratic party branches, the 
Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-party personages. 
He pointed out: When we study theories, we should pay 
attention to linking them with practice. We must make use of 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to 
conscientiously sum up new experiences in strengthening the 
building of democratic parties themselves, persisting in and 
improving multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the 
CPC, and promoting the political consultative system, so that 
democratic parties can play their role in a still better way by 
participating in and discussing government and political affairs 
in China's political life and democratic supervision. 
  In his speech, Zhang Boxing also said: Now we are living in 
an age of great transformation, and it is more urgent and 
necessary for us to study theory. Establishing a socialist 
market economic system is precisely a great and creative 
undertaking. It is a strenuous and heavy task. In facing the 
new situation and new task, there are a lot of things which we 
are not familiar with or aware of. On the road of progress, we 
will encounter many complicated things which we never 
experienced in the past. Only by studying well the theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics can we fully 
grasp the dialectical relations of reform, development and 
stability, and can we properly handle various kinds of social 
contradictions to ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening 
up and modernization. 
  While dwelling on the issue of developing our province's 
economy and taking the road of common prosperity, Zhang Boxing 
stressed: The key to narrowing the gaps between our province and 
the advanced areas and taking the road of common prosperity lies 
in persisting in developing the productive forces. To develop 
the productive forces, we must emancipate our minds, seek truth 
from facts, and seize the favorable opportunity. We must work 
with perseverance and overcome difficulties to resolutely push 
reform forward. 
  He continued: To narrow the gaps, we must also continue to 
carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In the 
course of developing the state-owned economy, we must make great 
efforts to develop our new publicly-owned economy and township 
and town enterprises and must firmly grasp the nongovernmental 
economy. Only thus can we constantly enhance our province's 
economic strength and have sufficient financial, material and 
manpower resources to support the impoverished areas. Only thus 
will our people boost their confidence in construction and 
improve their livelihood. Zhang Boxing also expressed the hope 
that participating comrades would work in close cooperation, 
unite as one, and suggest ways and means to promote our 
province's economy.

  [Text] Urumqi, May 16 (XINHUA) -- High-tech industry has 
been expanding rapidly in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region. 
  According to local officials, the autonomous region has 
undertaken 10 projects listed under the national "Torch Plan". 
All of the 10 projects have now entered the production stage 
and have developed 70 kinds of high-tech products, which sell 
well in both domestic and overseas markets. 
  The Torch Plan is aimed at promoting the development of new 
and high-tech industries in China. The program was inaugurated 
in 1988 and is now focused on the microelectronics, computers, 
information, laser, new materials, bioengineering, new energy, 
energy-efficient, machinery-electronics integrated technology 
and products sectors. 
  The Tianshan Boiler Plant has developed a series of boilers 
which have improved thermal efficiency by five percent and 
reduced production costs by 30 percent. 
  The technology for producing such new boilers has been 
transferred to 42 factories in 16 provinces and municipalities, 
and earned 20 million yuan for the province. 
  The Urumqi High-Tech Development Zone, which was approved by 
the State Council as a state-level high-tech development zone 
and is home to 194 enterprises, realized 110 million yuan in 
total earnings last year.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- President Jiang Zemin 
urged the international community Tuesday [17 May] not to 
overestimate China's influence on North Korea to settle an 
international dispute over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear 
development program, Japanese officials said. 
  Jiang made the comment in a meeting with Wataru Kubo, 
secretary general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social 
Democratic Party [of Japan], the officials said. 
  Jiang described as "a matter of the past" a remark by 
Japan's 
former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano that the 1937 Nanjing 
massacre was a fabrication, the officials said. 
  "Let's call it over. Let's proceed toward the future," Jiang 
was quoted as saying.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin on Tuesday [17 May] urged Japan and China to put the 
remarks of former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano behind them 
and move forward with the development of friendly bilateral 
relations for the future, Japanese officials said. 
  "Let's put the Nagano remarks in the past and move ahead 
thinking of the future," Jiang told Wataru Kubo, secretary 
general of Japan's No. 2 opposition party, the Social Democratic 
Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ]. 
  Kubo on Monday delivered a letter to Jiang from Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata expressing regret over Nagano's claim that 
the 1937 Nanjing massacre was a fabrication. 
  Jiang told Kubo that he appreciated the apology from Japan. 
  Regarding concerns that North Korea may be trying to build a 
nuclear arsenal, Kubo said he hopes the issue could be resolved 
through dialogue and he had expectations for China's role in 
unlocking the stalemate. 
  Jiang also hoped to see the issue resolved through 
negotiations but cautioned the international community should 
not overestimate China's influence on North Korea. 
  "Looking forward to a resolution through dialogue, China 
hopes to play a positive role," Jiang said but added, "it is 
unrealistic to overestimate China's role." 
  Jiang told Kubo that China, North Korea's only major ally in 
the world, wants to see a stable Korean peninsula free of 
nuclear arms. 
  Kubo is currently in China on an eight-day visit through 
Sunday as head of an SDPJ delegation marking the 10th 
anniversary of the party's exchanges with China's Communist 
Party.

  [Text] Beijing, May 16 KYODO -- Three inspectors from the 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) arrived in Beijing on Monday [16 
May] on their way to monitor the refueling of a North Korean 
nuclear facility. 
  The team from the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency is 
scheduled to leave Beijing for Pyongyang on Tuesday and to begin 
inspection of a 5-megawatt experimental nuclear plant at 
Yongbyon, near Pyongyang, on Wednesday. 
  Despite a North Korean announcement Saturday that it had 
removed seals and started replacing spent fuel rods at the 
reactor, the team will continue with a previous agreement and 
monitor the refueling process, team leader Olli Heinonen said. 
  An IAEA spokesman said Saturday in Vienna that if North 
Korea 
commits a serious violation of the nuclear safeguard agreement, 
such as removing seals from the fuel rod container, the team may 
suspend the scheduled inspections. 
  "We just want to check and see for ourselves and then we'll 
all be much wiser," Heinonen told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in Beijing. 
  Heinonen, who has been to North Korea "many times," refused 
to comment on the nuclear situation there, nor would he comment 
on whether his team shares any concerns over North Korean safety 
precautions. 
  "We've been to many countries and we've seen many plants and 
many situations," he said. 
  The Yongbyon plant is at present supposedly undergoing its 
initial refueling, although U.S. intelligence reports say the 
plant may have been refueled in 1989. 
  The IAEA inspectors hope to verify whether refueling took 
place in 1989 and whether or not any of the spent fuel has been 
diverted to other uses, particularly military uses. 
  The IAEA team also hopes to inspect a laboratory that it was 
denied access to during an uncompleted inspection in March, 
Heinonen said. 
  Western countries suspect the lab is involved in a program 
to 
produce nuclear arms. 
  Heinonen said his team will collect as much data as possible 
and return "in about a week" to Vienna where the inspectors will 
formulate a report with other IAEA experts.

  [Text] Beijing, May 17 KYODO -- A team of three inspectors 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing 
for Pyongyang on Tuesday [17 May] to undertake inspections of a 
North Korean nuclear power station at Yongbyon. 
  The team is expected to monitor the refueling of a 
5-megawatt 
experimental nuclear reactor and inspect a nuclear laboratory 
suspected of producing nuclear weapons at Yongbyon near 
Pyongyang. 
  Team leader Olli Heinonen disclosed little to journalists 
about his mission as he prepared to leave Beijing's capital 
airport. 
  "You know our rules are such that we have to evaluate the 
results, and we take samples and we analyze them and after that 
we tell what we think. So there will be no comment whatsoever," 
he said. 
  Heinonen said the inspections will last about a week. 
  The (North) KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA) said Saturday 
the fuel rod replacement has begun and the seals on the 
reactor's fuel rods have been broken. 
  Such moves would be in violation of agreements between the 
IAEA and North Korea, an IAEA official in Vienna said, and could 
signal the recall of the inspectors. 
  Removal of the seals would make it impossible to determine 
whether plutonium has been diverted to North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons program, experts said. 
  The inspection team has been sent "to see for ourselves," 
Heinonen said. 
  The IAEA and the United States have been involved in 15 
months of drawn-out negotiations with North Korea to verify the 
extent of its nuclear program and to confirm whether or not the 
Stalinist state has developed a nuclear weapon. 
  An IAEA inspection group also led by Heinonen were refused 
entry into the Yongbyon Laboratory during an inspection tour 
last March, which led to further calls for UN sanctions against 
the North.

  [Text] United Nations, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Trade and 
environment should be of mutual support to each other instead of 
obstacles to each other's development, a Chinese official told 
the second session of the Commission on Sustainable Development 
today. 
  Delivering a statement at the session, Zhang Kunmin, head of 
the Chinese delegation, said that in order to protect the 
ecological environment and consumers' health and safety, it is 
necessary to formulate appropriate environmental regulations and 
standards in international trade. 
  But he said environmental protection should not be an excuse 
for new protectionism and non-tariff trade barriers. 
  Otherwise, he warned, they would only further limit the 
export of developing countries, which would lead to the 
aggravation of poverty and the weakening of their power in 
environmental protection. 
  Zhang pointed out that when establishing environmental 
regulations and standards, the international community should 
also take into consideration the situation and requirements of 
developing countries. 
  The developed countries should help the developing countries 
to "improve their capability in the compliance of environmental 
regulations and standards through such forms as technology 
transfer," Zhang said. In short, he added, the principle of 
"prompting the economic growth of trade partners and the 
development of developing countries," which was brought forth in 
the declaration of Uruguay Round, should be substantively 
adhered to. 
  In recent years, the question of relations between trade and 
environment has become one of the hot issues, which have 
attracted much attention from the international community.

  [Text] Bridgetown [Barbados], 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- While 
speaking at the UN global meeting on sustainable development for 
the developing islet states (or global meeting of islet states 
for short) on 26 April, Jiang Chengzong, deputy head of the 
Chinese delegation, pointed out: In history, developed 
countries colonized many islet states; questions left over that 
restrict islet states' economic development still have a 
negative impact. China maintains that developed countries 
should take the indispensable responsibility to help developing 
islet states realize sustainable economic development. 
  Speaking of the unique situation and difficulties that 
developing islet states encounter, Jiang Chengzong said: Islet 
states encounter difficulties common with other developing 
countries, such as debts, unfavorable trading conditions, a lack 
of capital, and a low level of technology. In addition, they 
are restricted to such unique unfavorable conditions as a bad 
ecological situation, a lack of transportation facilities, the 
small scales of their economies, and a single product. Islet 
states are the first to be affected by changes of climate, the 
rising of the ocean's level, and ocean and seashore pollution. 
Islet states' economic development is seriously restricted by 
those developed countries. 
  He said emphatically: Islet states' sustainable development 
is an inseparable part of global sustainable development. The 
international community should take feasible measures to help 
developing islet states overcome difficulties and march toward 
the road of sustainable development step by step. 
  Jiang Chengzong maintained that over the past two years 
since 
the conclusion of the UN environment and development meeting, 
the international community and other relevant international 
organizations have done a great deal in implementing the 
meeting's resolutions. However, much greater efforts are still 
needed. The unfavorable international economic climate which 
has seriously restrained very large developing countries from 
realizing their economic development and environmental 
protection targets has not yet improved. Commitments concerning 
capital and the transfer of technology made at the environment 
and development meeting need to be carried out. 
  He said: To change the situation fundamentally, we need 
strong political will and a complete set of concrete and 
effective measures, accompanied by such things as capital and 
the transfer of technology, so as to ensure the implementation 
of these measures. 
  The global meeting of islet states which opened in 
Bridgetown, the capital of Barbados, on 25 April will conclude 
on 6 May.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Cable-stayed bridges 
will become increasingly popular all over the world, according 
to leading international bridge engineers. 
  The engineers, attending the 1994 international symposium 
here on cable-stayed bridges, agreed that more and more such 
bridges will be erected throughout the world for their beauty 
and sophisticated technology. 
  In a paper read at the symposium, Man-chung Tang, a 
professor 
at Columbia University in the United States, said that some 300 
cable- stayed bridges have appeared worldwide since the first 
such bridge was built at Stromsund, Switzerland, 40 years ago. 
  "Cable-stayed bridges fill the gap of efficient span range 
between conventional medium-span girder bridges and the very 
long- span suspended bridges," he said. 
  "The beauty of the cable-stayed bridge is so overwhelming 
that the general public will quickly fall in love with it. For 
this reason, more cable-stayed bridges will be built around the 
world in the future," he added. 
  German Bridge Engineer Holger Svensson said that three 
cable- 
stayed bridges have erected on the Rhine River in Germany alone. 
  He said in a paper that such bridges to be built in Europe 
will have an increasingly bigger span. 
  For example, such a bridge with a span of 1,204 m will be 
erected in Denmark. 
  He said that a feasibility study of building another 
cable-stayed bridge with a span of 1,500 m in Europe has been 
completed. 
  The bridge is expected to use conventional materials such as 
steel and concrete, he added. 
  Chang Song-pil, a professor at Seoul National University, 
said that several cable-stayed bridges have been built in the 
Republic of Korea in the past decade. 
  Engineers from Malaysia, Japan, Norway and France also read 
papers during the symposium, which is scheduled to close today.

<F P=106> ["Urgent: U.S. Reiterates Its Position on Taiwan and Tibet" </F>
-- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Washington, May 16 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
government today reiterated its position on Tibet and Taiwan, 
saying that it is "long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part 
of China." 
  "Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as a 
sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan 
government-in-exile," said a statement issued by the office of 
U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry. 
  The statement was released following the recent adoption of 
"The Foreign Relations Authorization Act" by the U.S. Congress. 
  The statement also said that the United States will continue 
to follow a "one-China" policy. 
  On the issue of U.S. arms sale to Taiwan, the statement 
said, 
"we continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982 
Communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as 
one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship. 
Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will 
interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment." 
  "The United States remains fully committed to the Three 
Joint 
Communiques between the P.R.C. (People's Republic of China) and 
the U.S. as the framework of our China policy. Nothing in the 
foreign relations authorization act changes this," the statement 
added.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman issued a statement today expressing appreciation for 
the statement made by a U.S. State Department spokesman that the 
United States does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile. 
The Foreign Ministry spokesman also hoped that the U.S. 
Government will conscientiously keep its promise. 
  On 16 May, a U.S. State Department spokesman issued a 
statement reiterating: It has been the United States' 
long-standing policy that Tibet is part of China. Neither the 
United States, nor any other countries, regards Tibet as a 
sovereign nation. The United States does not recognize a 
Tibetan government-in-exile. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "We appreciate this 
statement by the United States. We hope the U.S. Government 
will conscientiously keep its promise." 
  The spokesman said: Everyone knows that Tibet is an 
inalienable part of China. Tibetan affairs are entirely China's 
internal affairs which do not tolerate interference by any other 
foreign countries. 
  The spokesman reiterated: The Central Government's policy 
toward the Dalai Lama and his followers has been consistent and 
specific, and it has never changed. There have been avenues for 
contacts between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's 
representatives. The door of negotiations has always been open. 
  The spokesman indicated: As long as the Dalai Lama 
recognizes Tibet as an inalienable part of China, completely 
renounces the proposition for "Tibet independence," and 
discontinues the activities of splitting the motherland, the 
Central Government is ready to negotiate with the Dalai Lama at 
any time. Any issue, except "Tibet independence," is negotiable.

  [Text] Vladivostok, May 17 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese warship 
formation arrived here this morning for a four-day call-in 
visit, the first of its kind by the Navy of the People's 
Liberation Army to a Russian port. 
  Headed by Wang Jiying, commander of the North China Sea 
Fleet 
of the Chinese Navy, the formation consists of a deep-sea rescue 
vessel, a destroyer and an escort vessel, both equipped with 
missile launchers. 
  The call-in visit is in return for a visit made by a Russian 
naval fleet to eastern China's Qingdao last August. 
  The formation was honored first by a gun salute from the 
Russian Navy stationed in Vladivostok, and then at a quayside 
welcoming ceremony attended by commanders of Russia's Pacific 
Fleet. 
  Wang told the press that the Armed Forces of China and 
Russia 
are increasing their exchange programs, and the friendly 
relationship between the two navies is on the rise. 
  He also noted that closer ties between the two navies would 
serve the interests not only of the two peoples, but also of the 
peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and of the world 
as a whole.

<F P=106> [Preface written by President Jiang Zemin, "Arm With the </F>
Knowledge of Modern Science and Technology," for the book 
Basic Modern Scientific and Technological Knowledge, 
Selective Readings for Cadres] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- To enrich the scientific 
and technological knowledge of cadres at the county level or 
higher and to raise their level of leadership over the 
modernization construction, I have on several occasions 
suggested the compilation and editing of a book that would 
systematically impart to them the basic Marxist views that 
science and technology are the productive force, an easily 
readable book that would explain the scientific and 
technological development and trend in simple terms, and a book 
that would discuss ways to cope with the development of science 
and technology. Thanks to the joint efforts made by the 
comrades in the State Science and Technology Commission and 
comrades in other units, my wish has been finally realized. 
  Science and technology are the important impetus for the 
development of productive forces as well as the important 
indication of social progress. A comprehensive look into the 
history of civilization shows that every major breakthrough in 
science and technology always brings about profound changes in 
productivity and leads to great social progress. Since the 
beginning of this century, particularly since the end of World 
War II, major breakthroughs and the rapid development of a 
number of cutting-edge new and high technologies such as 
electronic information, biotechnology, and new materials have 
profoundly changed the world outlook and human life. Science 
and technology have penetrated all spheres of economic activity 
and social life and have become the most important factors 
propelling the development of productivity. In the final 
analysis, science and technology represent a decisive factor in 
the progress of modern society. Competition in the 
international arena in modern times is nothing but the 
competition of overall national strength. Science and 
technology are the keys to winning the international 
competition. Comrade Deng Xiaoping had the perspicacity of 
discerning this great historical trend and stated in a clear-cut 
manner that "science and technology are the primary productive 
forces," which is a scientific exposition that has enriched and 
developed the Marxist theory on productivity and that has 
provided a major guide for building China into a strong and 
prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modernized socialist 
country. 
  The remaining decade of this century and the next 50 years 
of 
the next century are a critical period for the invigoration of 
the Chinese nation. The world's progressive tide of peace and 
development and the evolving scientific and technological 
revolution have provided opportunity for China's reform, opening 
up, and economic development. We must seize this 
hard-to-come-by historical opportunity, closely track the 
development of science and technology in the world, accelerate 
the pace of developing new industries, constantly increase the 
role of scientific and technological progress in bringing about 
economic development, and promote the sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the entire national economy. A look at 
contemporary world history will tell us that many poor and 
backward countries experienced an economic takeoff within a very 
short space of time. Although they varied in their respective 
conditions and advantageous factors for development, they did 
share one thing in common -- that is, they stressed education 
and were good at adopting advanced science and technology. 
Because we have a superior socialist system and because our 
people are known for their hardworking spirit and for their 
wisdom, we will surely realize the grand objective of socialist 
modernization in 50 to 60 years if we persevere in our tireless 
efforts by unwaveringly adhering to the theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic 
line, and by resolutely relying on scientific and technological 
progress. 
  To accelerate the pace of scientific and technological 
progress in China, it is essential to raise the scientific and 
technological level of various levels of leading cadres. Since 
adopting the policy of reform and opening up to the outside 
world, China has made great strides in training more educated 
and professional cadres. At present, most leading cadres at the 
county-level or higher are at least college educated, if not 
higher educated than that. This, however, does not necessarily 
mean that leading cadres, notwithstanding their higher 
educational level, are familiar with or have mastered modern 
scientific and technological knowledge. Cadres, whether they 
majored in social science or in natural science in college, 
whether they graduated many years ago or just graduated from 
college, need to go through a restudying process. We know that 
modern science and technology develop at a dizzying pace, that 
new inventions and new theories emerge one after another, and 
that old knowledge is being replaced by new knowledge with great 
rapidity. Only by carrying out assiduous study, by constantly 
acquiring new knowledge, and by arming ourselves with knowledge 
can it be possible for use to increase our decision-making power 
and to improve the art of leadership. Because there is a vast 
amount of scientific and technological knowledge, it is 
impossible for our middle-level and high-level cadres to become 
experts in certain fields and in certain disciplines. But it is 
completely possible for our cadres to broaden and deepen their 
range of knowledge or even to become specialized in certain 
fields. Failing to accomplish that, they cannot be said to be 
qualified leaders. 
  We now face an important task of stepping up the study and 
mastery of modern scientific and technological knowledge. All 
levels of cadres must recognize the importance of acquiring more 
knowledge and of enhancing awareness of the need to gain more 
knowledge out of a sense of making the country strong and 
prosperous and of invigorating the Chinese nation. When 
acquiring scientific and technological knowledge, we must keep 
the followings in mind: We must be undaunted before 
difficulties; we must always show a willingness to ask 
questions; we must apply knowledge in our daily lives; and we 
must have perseverance. Because cadres are entrusted with the 
heavy task of providing leadership in socialist modernization 
construction, they are indeed very busy. Despite busy work 
schedules, they should find time for study. This book may serve 
as "a beginner's" reading for understanding modern scientific 
and technological knowledge. I suggest that cadres devote a bit 
of effort to thoroughly reading this book. To always enrich and 
broaden their range of knowledge, cadres may, after finishing 
this book, want to read more social science or natural science 
works, depending on their job positions and work requirements. 
If mid- and high-level cadres know how to arm themselves with 
scientific and technological knowledge, to increase their 
capability for understanding nature, for utilizing nature, and 
for transforming and protecting nature, they will be able to 
better lead and mobilize hundreds and millions of people to 
advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and to sketch a newer and more beautiful picture 
scroll on the vast motherland's land.

<F P=106> [By Central People's Radio Network reporter Liu Zhenying </F>
(0491 2182 5391) and XINHUA reporter Sun Benyao (1327 2609 1031)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Anhui's economic 
achievement exhibition opened today at the National Culture 
Palace in Beijing. 
  Prior to the opening of the exhibition, Jiang Zemin, general 
secretary of the CPC Central Committee and president; Qiao Shi, 
member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC 
Central Committee and chairman of the National People's Congress 
Standing Committee; Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau 
Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, visited 
the exhibition, respectively. Premier Li Peng inscribed the 
name of the exhibition before he left to visit foreign countries. 
  The exhibition conveys through different perspectives 
Anhui's 
economic achievements since China adopted the policy of reform 
and opening up, particularly the recovery and development of 
Anhui's economy since it was hit by a major flood in 1991. At 
the same time, it also shows the general condition of its 
economic development and its potential and bright prospects for 
economic development. It is the first time that Anhui has held 
such a large-scale exhibition in the capital since the founding 
of New China. 
  Anhui has not only recovered from the 1991 flood in a short 
time, but has also scored great developments in economic 
construction and in social undertakings. Anhui's GNP grew 17 
percent and its social development general index rose 30 percent 
in 1992. The momentum of rapid and healthy development 
continued and sustained in 1993. Anhui's GNP was up 22 percent 
in 1993 from the previous year and its development speed ranked 
top in the nation. 
  In the evening of 24 April, General Secretary Jiang Zemin, 
accompanied by Lu Rongjing, Anhui provincial CPC committee 
secretary, and Governor Fu Xishou, visited the exhibition with 
great enthusiasm. He closely watched videos, display objects, 
models, and photos at different exhibition booths. He 
attentively listened to briefings of relevant personnel. 
Whenever he was told of a particular economic achievement that 
Anhui has achieved in recent years, he would nod to show his 
satisfaction. After touring the scenes of the exhibition, Jiang 
Zemin spoke to Anhui's leading comrades: "Please do an even 
better job; the future of Anhui is very promising." 
  Chairmen Qiao Shi and Li Ruihuan visited the exhibition on 
the morning of 25 April and 26 April, respectively. They were 
both pleased with the achievements in economic construction and 
in social undertakings that Anhui has scored over the last two 
years. After viewing the exhibition, Qiao Shi said the 
exhibition showed great changes in Anhui and he was greatly 
impressed by those changes. Li Ruihuan said Anhui's fast 
recovery from a major disaster is really a rare feat. This 
fully shows the Chinese Communist Party possesses a cohesive 
force and the superiority of the socialist system. He added 
that the most important experience that one gains from the rapid 
and healthy development of Anhui's economy is that Anhui knows 
how to seize and to give play to its own characteristics and 
superiority. 
  Those present at the opening ceremony of the exhibition 
included leading comrades Li Ruihuan, Sun Qimen, and Li Guixian; 
persons in charge of organs directly under the CPC Central 
Committee, of some departments of the party and state organs, of 
relevant departments of the People's Liberation Army; and people 
from various circles in Beijing, and foreign guests. 
  In his opening address, Fu Xishou said Anhui's victory over 
the 1991 flood and in the subsequent flood-relief work was made 
possible by the Anhui people's hard work. He added that the 
victory was made all the more possible because of the superior 
socialist system. It was the result of the great concern and 
great support, both spiritually and materially, given by the CPC 
Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military 
Commission. It was also the result of the concern and 
assistance rendered by the party, the government, the military, 
and the people in the capital; the people throughout the nation; 
and overseas compatriots. The purpose of holding such an 
exhibition in Beijing, he said, is to express the sincere 
gratitude of the Anhui people and to publicize Anhui, so as to 
accelerate the pace of economic construction and the 
modernization drive in Anhui. 
  Those who attended the opening ceremony toured the scenes of 
the exhibition. The exhibition was divided into 16 sections 
showing Anhui's achievements in agriculture, village and 
township enterprises, metallurgy industry, petrochemical 
industry, machinery industry, electronic industry, science and 
technology, and foreign trade. 
  State Councillor Luo Gan and other leading comrades also 
visited the exhibition prior to the opening ceremony. 
  The exhibition will close on 2 May.

Political Bureau, state councilor, and minister of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economy at the 1994 China 
Beijing International High-Level Economic Forum, 11 May 1994: 
"Economic Structural Reform and Establishment of the System of a 
Socialist Market Economy in China"] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: 
  The 1994 China Beijing International High-Level Economic 
Forum has opened today. This high-level international economic 
forum, co-sponsored by the Chinese State Commission for 
Restructuring Economic Systems [SCRES] and THE INTERNATIONAL 
HERALD TRIBUNE, has won support from many leading world famous 
enterprises. Here, on behalf of the Chinese Government, I would 
like to extend a warm welcome to our friends from political, 
economic, and academic circles of various countries, and express 
our heartfelt thanks to the entrepreneurs who have supported 
this forum! 
  The Chinese Government attaches great importance to this 
forum. The persons in charge of some departments of the State 
Council will come and apprise you of relevant information. 
China's economists, scholars, and entrepreneurs are also highly 
interested in this meeting. We hope that it will help the 
international community understand more about China's reform and 
opening process, especially the theory and practice of a 
socialist market economy, and contribute to smooth operation of 
China's reform and opening up; and also help China to acquire a 
further understanding of the world and absorb and draw on the 
experience of success of other countries. This is the first time 
that such a high-level international economic forum has ever 
been held in Beijing. I hope such international economic forums 
can be held regularly in the future. 
  Now, I would like to brief you on the progress and 
achievements of reform and opening up in China and the process 
of establishing a system of socialist market economy. 
<H5>  1. Process and Achievements of Reform and Opening Up in China </H5>
  1.1 Process of reform in China. 
  In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee decided to shift the focus of its work to 
economic construction and pursue the policy of reform and 
opening up. Over the past 15 years, following the road of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has, 
roughly speaking, gone through three phases in its extensive and 
profound economic structural reforms. 
  1.1.1 The first phase (December 1978 -- September 1984). 
The focus of the reform was on rural areas, mobilizing peasant 
enthusiasm in promoting the production of commodities by 
developing various forms of the contract responsibility system 
on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. In 
urban areas, the main operation was experimentation on 
enterprise reforms, expanding the independent decisionmaking 
powers of enterprises. In the meantime, the development of 
special economic zones [SEZs] began and 14 port cities on the 
coast were opened. 
  1.1.2 The second phase (October 1984 -- December 1991). The 
focus of the reform shifted to urban areas. Centering around 
the task of strengthening the vitality of enterprises, market 
building, price reform, and reform of the macro management 
system were pushed forward in a coordinated way. Urban and 
rural reforms, as well as reforms of the scientific and 
technological, educational, and political systems unfolded 
across the board. Opening up was further expanded. Hainan SEZ 
was established. The Zhu Jiang delta, Chang Jiang delta, and 
South Fujian triangle were opened. 
  1.1.3 The third phase (January 1992 -- 2000). China's 
reform entered the new stage of building a socialist market 
economic system. As far as reforms are concerned, the focus is 
switching from breaking the old systems to establishing new 
systems and from policy adjustments to structural innovations, 
single reforms are being replaced by comprehensive and 
integrated reforms, and the endeavor to achieve breakthroughs at 
important points is moving toward the integration of both 
overall advancement and key breakthroughs. Opening up is 
heading into unprecedented scope and depth. One may well say 
that the coming few years are a crucial period for the final 
replacement of the system of planned economy with the system of 
a socialist market economy in China. 
  1.2 The 15-year reform and opening up have brought 
about profound changes to economic structural patterns and 
operational mechanisms in China. 
  --A new pattern has taken shape in which public ownership 
reigns and a variety of economic sectors, including state, 
collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded economies 
coexist, compete on equal footing, and seek common development. 
At present, state industry accounts for 48.3 percent of the 
total industrial output value, collective industry accounts for 
38.2 percent, and individual, private, and foreign-funded 
industries 13.5 percent. Of the total retail volume of 
commodities, state commerce accounts for 41.3 percent, 
collective commerce 27.9 percent, and joint-venture, individual, 
and private commerce 30.8 percent. The rapid development of 
non-state-owned economies has injected life force and vitality 
into China's economy. 
  --Efforts have been made to deepen the reform of state 
enterprises continuously and to explore specific ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system. State enterprises are 
changing their identity to become independent legal entities and 
subjects of market competition. State enterprises' operational 
decisionmaking powers have expanded. Various forms of a 
contract operational responsibility system have been introduced. 
A large number of enterprise groups have been developed. The 
merger, leasing, and auctioning off of enterprises have been 
promoted. Deep-level reforms aimed at changing operational 
mechanisms have been conducted. To find effective forms into 
which public ownership can be realized, various types of 
experiments on the joint-stock system in selected organizations 
have been conducted. At present, the number of enterprises 
under various types of experimentation with joint-stock systems 
in China has reached 11,500. A batch of state- owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises are being organized to accommodate 
experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
  --Efforts have been made to cultivate the market system and 
push ahead with price reform, bringing enormous changes to the 
formative mechanism of prices and continuously strengthening the 
role of market mechanisms. Energetic efforts have been made to 
develop various kinds of retail and wholesale markets and 
cultivate production element markets, including capital, real 
estate, labor, and technical and information markets. As a 
result of the 15-year evolutionary price reform, today the 
prices of over 80 percent of production means, over 85 percent 
of agricultural products, and over 95 percent of industrial 
consumer goods have been decontrolled. The prices of production 
elements are in the process of marketization and the market 
mechanism is playing an ever expanding role in the disposition 
of resources. 
  --Macroregulation and control by the state are changing from 
direct control exercised with administrative mandates to 
indirect regulation and control which mainly employ economic and 
legal means. Before 1978, mandatory plans accounted for over 95 
percent of the total industrial output value, but now this has 
dropped to 5 percent. The amount of means of production under 
unified distribution by the state and the amount of commodities 
purchased under state plans have also greatly decreased. With 
the on-going reforms in the planning, investment, financial, and 
banking systems, taxs, interest, and exchange rates and the 
money supply have gradually come to serve as chief means of 
macroregulation and control. 
  --A distribution pattern has taken shape in which 
distribution according to work dominates and is combined with a 
variety of other modes of distribution. The establishment of a 
new social security system has also made a start. The method of 
linking total payroll to economic efficiency and linking 
employee remunerations to personal contributions at work has 
been extensively adopted among state-owned enterprises. Some 
progress has also been made in the reform of employee pension, 
unemployment, medical, and industrial injury insurance, and 
housing systems. 
  --Responsibility systems, primarily the contract 
responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration 
linked to output, and the two-tier management system combining 
unification and division have been implemented extensively in 
China's rural areas. The adjustment of the prices of 
agricultural products and adjustments in the purchasing and 
marketing systems have aroused peasant enthusiasm. China's 
grain output increased from 300 million metric tons in 1978 to 
456 million metric tons in 1993. China has been feeding 22 
percent of the world population with 7 percent of the world's 
arable land. By the end of 1993, 23.21 million township and 
town enterprises had been set up in rural areas, absorbing 110 
million members of rural surplus labor, which has greatly 
contributed to the development of rural economy and increased 
peasant income. 
  1.3 The reform and opening up have pushed China's 
economy into a fast growth phase. 
  The 15-year reform and opening up have greatly emancipated 
and developed productive forces, mobilized people's initiative 
and creativity, and pushed China's economy up a big step. 
  --Economic growth has accelerated and overall national 
strength has increased. The average annual growth rate between 
1978 and 1993 was 9 percent. In 1992 and 1993 in particular, 
the GDP [as published] increased over the previous years by 12.8 
percent and 13.4 percent respectively. The rankings of the 
output of some of China's major industrial and agricultural 
products in the world have been significantly upgraded, and 
China's overall national strength has gone up to 10th position. 
  --The industrial structure has undergone some change and 
the importance of tertiary industry has incresed. Comparing the 
year 1993 to 1978 when the reform began, the proportions of 
three industries in the GNP went through the following changes: 
The proportion of primary industry dropped from 28.4 percent to 
21.2 percent, that of secondary industry rose from 48.6 percent 
to 51.8 percent, and that of tertiary industry rose from 23 
percent to 27 percent, in which communications and posts and 
telecommunications saw significant development. 
  --Brisk markets and an active internal trade have satisfied 
the growing material and cultural needs of urban and rural 
residents. The average annual growth rate of the total retail 
volume of commodities nationwide rose from 8 percent before the 
reform and opening up to 14.5 percent after the reform and 
opening up began. In 1993, the growth was 26.1 percent over the 
previous year. 
  1.4 A new pattern has formed in opening up and 
outstanding achievements have been made in foreign economic 
relations and trade. 
  --A new multilevel, all-dimensional, and multimodal pattern 
of opening up has been preliminarily formed. So far, five SEZs, 
32 economic and technological development zones, and 52 
state-level high and new-technology development zones have been 
set up. There are over 900 cities and counties in China that 
are open to the outside world. The opening up has started to 
spread from primary and secondary industries to tertiary 
industry. Improvements have been made in both the soft and the 
hard environments for investment. The service systems oriented 
to foreign-funded enterprises and laws and ordinances for 
transactions with other countries have been constantly improving. 
  --Gratifying results have been made in foreign trade. 
China's total import and export volume rose from $20.64 billion 
in 1978 to $195.8 billion in 1993, representing an increase of 
8.5 times, and the average annual growth rate was 16.2 percent. 
In 1993, China's total foreign trade volume ranked 11th in the 
world. The import and export volume of China now takes up 35 
percent of the country's GNP, making China one of the most open 
countries in the world. 
  --China has been showing a strong momentum of absorption and 
utilization of foreign capital. From 1979 to 1993, China 
approved a total of 174,000 foreign-invested projects and the 
actual input made by foreign investors totaled $63.9 billion. 
In 1993 alone, 83,000 projects of foreign investment were 
approved with the amount of foreign capital utilized being 
$25.76 billion. 
  --China's opening up has shifted from the previous practice 
of one-way introduction to two-way exchange. China encourages 
enterprises with adequate strength to make investments and set 
up enterprises abroad. By 1993, 4,497 Chinese enterprises had 
been set up in over 120 countries and regions, with $5.16 
billion of investment made by Chinese investors. 
  1.5 People's living standards have been improving by 
the year and so has their quality of life. 
  Since the reform and opening up began 15 years ago, the 
living standards of urban and rural residents have greatly 
improved. Peasant per-capita income per annum rose from 134 yuan 
in 1978 to 921 yuan in 1993; the per-capita wage of workers in 
cities and towns rose from 615 yuan in 1978 to 3,236 yuan in 
1993. Price hikes factored in, these two increases represent an 
average annual growth of 7 percent and 5 percent respectively. 
Housing conditions of urban and rural residents have improved. 
The per-capita living space in urban areas increased from 3.6 
square meters in 1978 to 8 square meters in 1993; and that in 
rural areas from 8.1 square meters to 19 square meters. The 
balance of saving deposits of urban and rural residents 
increased from 21.06 billion yuan in 1978 to 1.4764 trillion 
yuan in 1993. The number of students on campus in institutions 
of higher learning rose from 856,000 in 1978 to 4.4 million in 
1993. These enormous changes indicate that the road of 
expanding market regulation and reinforcing the role of market 
mechanisms that China has followed in its reform and opening up 
in the past 15 years is correct and China's economic structural 
reform has stood on a new starting point. 
  2. The Basic Experience of China's Economic 
Restructuring 
  2.1 The theoretical development of China's economic 
restructuring. 
  China's economic restructuring is the self-development and 
perfection of the socialist system and is an unprecedented 
theoretical exploration and bold practice. The breakthrough in 
reform theories and progress in practice run through the whole 
process of reform and opening up. 
  Prior to reform and opening up, China implemented a highly 
centralized planned economy marked by mandatory planning. To 
begin with, we proposed the principle of "taking the planned 
economy as the mainstay and supplementing it with market 
regulation" in 1979 and then set the goal of socialist planned 
commodity economy in 1984. We went further in 1992 by 
explicitly saying that the goal of China's economic 
restructuring was to establish a socialist market economic 
system. This is the most important breakthrough in the theory 
of China's economic restructuring and an innovative advance in 
Marxist political economics, and has set the goal and direction 
for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping's economic 
thinking has played a key role in the significant breakthrough 
in the theory and practices of China's economic restructuring. 
  2.2 Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking greatly 
contributes to China's reform and opening up. 
  Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and 
opening up and modernization, founded the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and laid out a grand 
blueprint for China's reform and opening up. A series of 
expositions by him on reform and opening up and the 
establishment of a socialist market economy occupy an extremely 
important position. He pointed out that China is still at the 
initial stage of socialism. The nature of socialism is to 
liberate and develop productive forces and the way to do so is 
reform and opening up. He laid stress on emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, taking our own path without 
mechanically copying foreign examples, respecting the innovative 
spirit of the masses, and proceeding in everything from China's 
actual situation. He pointed out that both planning and the 
market are economic means and that a socialist country can also 
develop a market economy. He advocated that in the practice of 
reform, we "need not argue with one another but should make 
experiments and blaze new trails in a bold manner" and that we 
verify the truth by practice. He has also stressed time and 
again that we should boldly absorb and draw on all achievements 
created in human civilizations, including all advanced forms of 
management and operation of developed capitalist countries which 
reflect the laws of modern socialized production. 
  Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, which clearly shows the 
direction of China's reform and opening up, is a huge impetus 
for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping has made 
historic contributions to China's reform and opening up. 
  2.3 The basic experience of China's economic 
restructuring. 
  --Sticking to economic development as the central task and 
taking as the fundamental socialist task the liberation and 
development of productive forces through reform and opening up. 
The practice of China's reform proves that only by changing 
once and for all the economic structure that restricts the 
development of productive forces and by establishing a socialist 
market economic structure which is full of vitality and vigor 
can we promote the development of productive forces. 
  --In the course of reform and opening up, we should absorb 
and use the successful experiences of other countries and, more 
importantly, seek truth from facts and find a new path with 
Chinese characteristics in the course of practice. In reform 
and opening up, we stick to the viewpoint that practice comes 
first and judge the success or failure of everything mainly by 
adhering to the criterion of whether it is beneficial to 
promoting productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the 
comprehensive national strength of our socialist country, and 
beneficial to enhancing the living standards of the people. 
  --Using planning and the market as the means to regulate the 
economy, fostering and developing a socialist market system, and 
bringing into full play the fundamental role of market 
mechanisms in the allocation of resources. In the practice over 
the past 15 years, we have always stuck to market-oriented 
reforms, removed price controls, fostered and established a 
market system, made sound the market order and laws and 
regulations for fair competition, brought into play the role of 
market mechanisms, thus promoting the smooth reform of the 
entire economic structure. 
  --Correctly handling the relationships between reform, 
development, and stability, and seizing the opportunity to 
quicken the change from the old structure to the new structure 
so that the national economy can be further enhanced at 
intervals of several years. Reform and opening up are the drive 
for development and development is the foundation for social 
stability and long-term national peace, and maintaining social 
stability is an indispensable condition for developing the 
economy and smoothly proceeding with reform. 
  --Sticking to the integration of reform at home and opening 
to the outside world so that they promote each other and benefit 
each other. Opening to the outside world is China's basic 
national policy which will remain unchanged for a long time to 
come. 
  Opening to the outside world, attracting capital and 
advanced technology from abroad, learning foreign advanced 
management experiences, and spurring China's enterprises to 
participate in competition in the international market have 
effectively promoted the deepening of reform at home and 
economic development. 
<H5>  3. The Goal of China's Economic Development and the Basic </H5>
Framework of a Socialist Market Economic Structure 
  3.1 The goal of economic development. 
  In 1980, China set the three-step strategic goal for 
socialist modernization. The first step is that China will 
double its GNP in approximately a decade, thus basically 
resolving the problem of food and clothing for the people. The 
second step is that it will double its GNP again by the end of 
this century so that the people will be able to lead a 
comparatively comfortable life. The third step is that by the 
middle of the next century, China will be able to catch up with 
or overtake the level of medium-developed countries so that the 
people will be better off. The first step was already achieved 
in 1988. In light of China's current development, the second 
step can be achieved ahead of time. In order to achieve the 
second-step and third-step strategic goal, it is necessary to 
quicken the establishment of a new socialist market economic 
structure so that China's economy can develop in a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy way. 
  3.2 The basic framework of a socialist market economic 
structure. 
  The economic structure we are now establishing is an 
economic 
structure in which public ownership and a market economy are 
inherently united, which is under the active and effective 
macroeconomic control of the State, the market mechanisms of 
which play an essential role in allocating resources, and which 
can combine efficiency and equality to high standards. The goal 
of establishing a new structure through reform is to liberate 
and develop productive forces to the greatest extent, reinforce 
comprehensive national strength, and enhance the people's living 
standards. The basic framework is: 
  3.2.1 Transforming the management mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. It is 
necessary to stick to the principle of taking the publicly owned 
sector as the mainstay while striving for a simultaneous 
development of all economic sectors, further transform the 
management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and establish a 
modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the 
market economy and in which property rights as well as the 
rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, 
government administration and enterprise management are 
separated, and scientific management is established. 
Establishing a modern enterprise system is a necessary 
requirement for developing large-scale socialized production and 
the market economy. It is the direction for the reform of 
China's state-owned enterprises as well as an effective form of 
achieving the integration of public ownership and the market 
economy. 
  3.2.2 Fostering and developing a market system and 
establishing a mechanism by which prices are mainly formed by 
the market. It is necessary to establish a nationwide 
integrated and open market system to closely combine the urban 
market with the rural market, link the domestic market with the 
international market, and create a fair environment for 
competition to optimize the allocation of resources. On the 
precondition of maintaining the relative stability of the 
general level of prices, we should remove price controls from 
competitive commodities and services, cancel the two-tier 
pricing system for the means of production, quicken the process 
of subjecting the prices of production elements to the market, 
and establish a mechanism by which prices are mainly set by the 
market. 
  3.2.3 Transforming the government's functions and 
establishing a sound macroeconomic control system. It is 
necessary to further transform government organizations, 
transform government functions in economic management, and 
establish a macroeconomic control system in which the national 
economy is managed mainly through economic, legal, and necessary 
administrative means. We should quicken the reform of the 
fiscal and tax, banking, and planned investment systems, and 
ensure the healthy operation of the national economy through 
effective macroeconomic control. 
  3.2.4 Establishing a rational income distribution system and 
a social security system. It is necessary to stick to a system 
that takes the principle of "to each according to his work" as 
its mainstay and allows the coexistence of many forms of 
distribution and to embody the principle of giving priority to 
efficiency and taking fairness into account. We should 
introduce competitive mechanisms, smash egalitarianism, and 
stick to encouraging some localities and people to become 
prosperous first, and then gradually attaining common 
prosperity. We should establish a multilayer and multiform 
social security system which embraces social insurance, social 
relief, social welfare, solace and settlement, social mutual 
help, and personal savings and accumulation security. The level 
of social security must be in keeping with China's national 
conditions. 
  3.2.5 Stabilizing the basic productive relationships in 
rural areas and establishing a rural economic structure suited 
to the socialist market economy. We should stick to contract 
responsibility systems, mainly the one on a household basis with 
remuneration linked to output, and the two-tier management 
system combining unification and division. We should develop 
the rural socialized service system and promote the 
specialization, commercialization, and socialization of 
agriculture. On the precondition of maintaining the steady 
growth of such basic agricultural products as grain and cotton, 
we will readjust the rural industrial structure and quicken the 
development of township and town enterprises and other 
nonagricultural sectors, offering more employment opportunities 
for the surplus rural work force. 
  3.2.6 Deepening the reform of the foreign trade structure 
and opening wider to the outside world. We should establish an 
open system of foreign trade and economic relations, actively 
participate in international economic competition and 
cooperation, and bring into play the comparative advantages of 
China's economy so that the domestic economy and the 
international economy will be linked with each other and 
supplement each other. We should standardize foreign economic 
activities and correctly handle foreign economic relations in 
keeping with China's national conditions and the general norms 
for international economic activities, and continuously enhance 
competitiveness in the world. 
  3.2.7 Further reform the system of science and technology, 
as well as the system of education. Responding to the needs of 
a socialist market economy, we will build a new system which 
conforms to the laws of development of science and technology 
itself, and which closely integrates science and technology with 
economy to promote scientific and technological progress and to 
realize a comprehensive and coordinated development of the 
economy, science, technology, and society. We need to actively 
develop the scientific and technological enterprises which 
belong to various ownership systems and operate in various 
styles. The organs specializing in applied and development 
research, and the organs providing scientific and technological 
consultation and information services, should face the market 
and promote integration of science and technology into economy. 
We must change the situation in which the government takes 
charge of everything in providing education and form a new 
system in which the government is the main player in providing 
education while various quarters of the society also take part. 
We will strengthen compulsory education, vigorously develop 
vocational and adult education, optimize the educational 
structure, and train various types of professionals for the 
society. 
  3.2.8 Strengthen the building of legal system. The essence 
of a market economy is an economy under a legal system. In the 
building and perfecting process, the socialist market economy 
system requires a sound legal system as its norm and to protect 
it. Before the end of this century, China must build a legal 
system which meets the needs of a socialist market economy, 
expedite the process of legislation for economic law, reform and 
improve judicial, law enforcing, and supervisory mechanisms, and 
perfect the organs providing legal services. 
  The above-mentioned eight areas constitute the basic 
framework of the system of a socialist market economy in China, 
in other words, they are the eight pillars supporting the new 
system in China. At this moment, our concept is to initially 
build a new economic system in the 1990's. On this basis, we 
must work hard for about 20 years to form a set of systems which 
are more mature and stable in various aspects. At present, on 
the basis of continuously summing up experiences in practice, we 
are moving toward this goal in a planned manner. We are full of 
confidence in the future of China's reform. 
<H5>  4. The Main Duties of Reform of Economic System in China in </H5>
1994 
  4.1 The year 1994 is a crucial year of realizing 
overall advancement of, and major breakthroughs in, reform of 
the economic system. 
  This year's basic principle of work is: Grasp the 
opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote 
development, and maintain stability. The main duties are: 
Change operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises, find 
an effective way to establish a modern enterprise system and 
expedite the reform of macroeconomic management system, then, 
with these as key points, carry out other reforms in a 
coordinated manner. This year, amid the rapid operation of the 
national economy, we must thoroughly promote reform, and in the 
overall changing of the old system into the new one, we must 
ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. At present, we must earnestly strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control, check inflation, properly 
handle the relations among reform, development, and stability, 
and ensure a smooth process of reform. 
  4.2 Enterprise reform. 
  This year, the State Council will select about 100 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to try out the 
building of a modern enterprises system and explore an effective 
way to establish a modern enterprise system. Regarding 
state-owned small enterprises, they will be transformed through 
forms such as leasing, contracting, and selling. Concerning 
enterprises which have been making losses for a long time, and 
which have debts larger than capital, they will go bankrupt 
according to law. A majority of state-owned enterprises must 
continue to change operational mechanisms, tackle the historical 
burdens on enterprises step by step, and create conditions for 
establishing a modern enterprise system. Urban collective 
enterprises, township and town enterprises, and nongovernmental 
high-tech enterprises may change their system to a joint-stock 
system, and those with better conditions may transform into 
joint-stock companies. Private enterprises will be encouraged 
to change into standardized companies. 
  4.3 Properly carry out reforms of the systems of 
taxation, finance, planning, and investment, and make a 
substantive step in the building of a new macro regulation and 
control system. 
  --The main content of revenue reform is to change the 
current 
system in which localities are solely responsible for their own 
finances, to a revenue-sharing system on the basis of a 
reasonable division of administrative power between the central 
and local authorities, establish a central and a local taxation 
system, and practice a system in which the central authorities 
give tax reimbursements to localities. We must step up the 
effort to carry out research on a standardized system in which 
the central authorities transfer revenues to and from local 
authorities and make preparations for further perfection of the 
taxation system in the future. 
  --We wil promote the circulating-tax system which is mainly 
based on value-added tax and, on the basis of lowering the 
income tax rate for state-owned enterprises, straighten out 
relations of distribution between the state and state-owned 
enterprises. We will standardize income tax for domestically 
funded enterprises, levy a standardized individual income tax, 
expand the scope for collecting resource taxes, and build and 
perfect the system of land taxes (fee) and property taxes. 
  --The reform of the financial system is mainly to build a 
macro regulation and control system to be enforced by the 
central bank, which independently implements currency policy 
under the leadership of the State Council; to improve and 
strengthen the central bank's functions; to maintain stability 
of the value of currency; to organize policy banks; to gradually 
separate the business of policy nature from the business of 
commercial nature; and to turn specialized state banks into 
state-owned commercial banks. 
  --To further deepen the reforms of planning and investment 
systems, we will change the function of planned management; 
strengthen the macro-nature, strategic nature, and policy nature 
of the contents of planning; and simplify annual planning, 
stressing medium- and long-term planning, and reduce mandatory 
planning goals. We will build a mechanism for restraining 
investment, strengthen the risk responsibility for main 
investment bodies and bank loans, perfect the macro-regulation 
and control over investment scale and structure, and standardize 
decisionmaking behavior regarding investment. 
  4.4 With development of markets of production factors 
as the key point, we must perfect the market system and continue 
to promote price reform. 
  We must continue to develop commodities markets, make 
special 
efforts to develop the markets of production factors such as 
capital, land, and labor markets, step up efforts to establish 
market regulations, standardize the behavior of the main market 
body, perfect market order, and form a market system which is 
unified, open, competitive, and orderly as soon as possible. We 
will further promote price reform and combine as soon as 
possible the two systems of prices of means of production. 
  4.5 Expedite the reforms of social insurance system 
and housing system. 
  The key point is to further reform and perfect the systems 
of 
old-age provision and medical insurance for staff and workers in 
cities, and the direction is to let units and individuals 
shoulder together old-age and medical insurance funds and to 
link overall planning by the society to individual accounts. We 
must expedite housing reform, thoroughly promote provident funds 
for housing purposes, and vigorously develop houses which suits 
our economy. 
  4.6 Promote reform of the foreign trade system, 
further expand opening up to the outside world. 
  We must really delegate self-determining power to foreign 
trade enterprises for them to do business, and develop 
export-oriented enterprise groups according to the requirement 
of modern enterprises system. We will further reform the system 
of import management, strengthen the role of chambers of 
commerce in coordination, and gradually establish a system of 
public tender and auction for quotas and permits. Step by step, 
we will allow large and medium-sized enterprises which have 
better conditions, scientific and technological enterprises, and 
circulation enterprises to have the right to engage in foreign 
trade. 
  4.7 Expedite legal system building for economy. 
We will announce, one by one, laws such as securities, labor, 
foreign trade, central bank, commercial bank, bill and receipt, 
insurance, futures exchange, and social security laws. For the 
areas which do not have the conditions for legislation at this 
moment, we will still formulate corresponding administrative 
rules or regulations. 
  At present, the above-mentioned reform plans have already 
been announced, progress has been relatively smooth, and this 
indicates that China has taken an important step toward the 
building of a socialist market economy system. In the first 
quarter of this year, China's GDP increased 12.7 percent, 
industrial production increased 18.6 percent, revenue increased 
21.4 percent, the national economy maintained a good operational 
trend, and the overall economy drew closer to the goal of 
macro-regulation and control. The main problems at this time 
are: Inflation is too high, some state-owned industrial 
enterprises have difficulties, and agricultural production lacks 
staying power. These problems have to be solved through 
deepening reform. 
  According to the demand raised by the 1994 government work 
report, which was adopted at the Second Session of the Eighth 
National People's Congress, the Chinese Government plans to have 
a 9 percent GDP growth this year. In light of the fact that the 
GDP increased 13 percent for two consecutive years, it is 
suitable to arrange such a growth rate. By so doing we can 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy. 
<H5>  5. China Will Continue To Advance Along the Road of Reform </H5>
and Opening Up 
  The building of socialist market economy system is a 
complicated and arduous historic mission. The reform over the 
past 15 years has scored great results, but there are also 
dissatisfying areas, and on the road ahead, we will still run 
into new twists and turns and difficulties. But we believe that 
this undertaking is in accordance with the basic interest of the 
Chinese people, and is conducive to peace, stability, and 
development in the world. 
  China is still a developing country, and its people are 
still 
not well-off, and efforts still have to be made in the last 
seven years of this century to solve the problem of food and 
clothing for 80 million people in the rural areas, to help them 
cast off poverty and achieve affluence. China has to work very 
hard for several decades in order to achieve the living standard 
characteristic of a moderately developed country. China's 
construction not only requires a lasting stable environment at 
home, but also requires a lasting stable and peaceful 
environment in the international community, in particular, China 
needs a good neighboring environment. We will continue to 
seriously learn from the successful and beneficial experiences 
acquired by the economic systems of various countries. 
  The Chinese Government's application for restoring its 
status 
as a signatory to GATT, is an important strategic decision on 
further expanding opening up to the outside world. When China 
participates in international the division of labor and 
international exchange according to the common international 
economic rules, it will be good for China's development and for 
the countries which have economic interactions with China. 
After 15 years of reform and opening up, China's investment 
environment has continuously improved, its economy has 
maintained a rapid growth trend, and its huge market potential 
is being unleashed, greatly attracting foreign investors. We 
are truly thankful to the persons who have offered assistance to 
China's economic development, we welcome the experts and 
scholars from various countries to China to carry out 
cooperation and offer valuable opinions on China's reform and 
opening up, and we sincerely hope more entrepreneurs from 
various countries and regions can come to China to make 
investments and to strengthen economic and trade interactions. 
Undoubtedly, the establishment of a new economic system will 
provide the best environment, in terms of system, to the foreign 
businessmen who come to invest in China. 
  Human beings are marching toward a new century. In order to 
have a bright future for China and for the world, China will 
work hard to handle its own affairs well, resolutely follow the 
independent and self-determining foreign policy of peace, and 
develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the 
countries in the world-- especially with our neighboring 
countries--on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. China, amid reform and opening up, and rising amid 
development, will always be a reliable force safeguarding 
regional and world peace. Let us work hard together to build a 
new international political and economic order that is just and 
bring human beings to a peaceful, developing, and prosperous 
21st century. Thank you!

  [Text] According to the provincial commission for 
production safety, the province is facing a serious situation in 
this area. Various types of accidents have occurred time and 
again. Last year, accidents in eight major categories caused 
more than 2,000 deaths and over 20 million yuan in direct 
economic losses, both record highs. 
  At a briefing, the person in charge of the commission 
pointed 
out: The main problems in safety-in-production work are as 
follows: In the course of building a socialist market economic 
structure, people have a weak sense of the legal system in 
production safety, the existing laws are imperfect, and even 
these are neither observed nor strictly enforced. The 
government and enterprises relax safety management. Some 
enterprise leaders put an undue emphasis on production to the 
detriment of safety and on education at the expense of 
management. As they invest little in the safety sector, hidden 
dangers of safety-related accidents can be found almost 
everywhere. The problem of production safety is especially 
pronounced in some provincial enterprises, township and town 
enterprises, and foreign-invested enterprises. Education and 
safety training are not carried out effectively among employees. 
Accidents are not earnestly investigated and handled. 
Furnaces, mines, and fire protection are still the weak links 
of production safety work. 
  To counter these problems, the provincial commission for 
production safety urged to further implement the production 
safety responsibility system, do a good job of the investigation 
and removal of hidden dangers for safety-related accidents, and 
at the same time, make good preparations for conducting this 
year's safety production week activities and the 119 fire 
production and safety day activities.

  [Text] Nairobi, May 13 (XINHUA) -- China today urged the 
developed countries to provide more concessionary funds to the 
African states. 
  In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African 
Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF) 
annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's 
Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies 
on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of 
African states, but the international community also bears a 
significant responsibility for this. 
  Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation 
attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11 
May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of 
the African people in pursuing economic independence. 
  Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted 
various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial 
and agricultural development on the African Continent, to 
improve the living standard of the African people, and to 
enhance the close cooperation among its member countries. 
  He noted that for promoting the economic development in 
Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest 
development and population control. 
  Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing 
in 
economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing 
at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has 
shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been 
deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25 
percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties 
include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the 
Western countries, he said. 
  On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of 
Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy, 
China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic 
development. "China is ready to continue making due 
contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB 
and ADF, which we consider the most important financial 
institutions in Africa," he added.

  [Text] Beijing, May 13 (CNS) -- Assistant Minister of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Long Yongtu, 
speaking at a press conference held here today, said that China 
hoped the UNited States ruled out political factors affecting 
economic and trade relations between China and America. The two 
sides should rebuild mutual- trust relations to overcome 
obstacle to the talks on China's return to GATT. 
  Mr. Long said that the United States had an important role 
in 
the process of resuming China's status in GATT. If the issue of 
China's MFN status could be solved in June, a better tendency 
for Sino- American negotiations on China's return to GATT would 
occur. 
  It is disclosed that China and America had agreed to have 
another negotiations on China's return to GATT in early June. 
  In the Marrakech meeting held in April, American Vice 
President Mr. Al Gore had told GATT Chief Mr. Peter Sutherland 
that America would take an active and constructive stance to 
participate in negotiations on China's return to GATT. There 
was no reason to considerthe American stance as an obstacle to 
the above matter. Mr. Sutherland conveyed the American stance 
to Chinese leaders during his visit to China. 
  Head of China's delegation for China's return to GATT and 
Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Gu 
Yongjiang, also said that today it had been 8 years since China 
applied for return to GATT. The GATT contracting parties put 
forward some requirements on China regarding reduction of tariff 
and non-tariff barriers for imports and exports and transparency 
of foreign trade, China had earnestly made preparations for and 
replied to these matters. 
  Mr. Gu said a main obstacle was that some GATT contracting 
parties had asked for some excessive demands on China. China 
was a developing country and it was undertaking obligations set 
for developing countries as well as enjoying rights offered by 
the world trade organization. In conformity with China's 
present economic development situation, he said, China may also 
shoulder some obligations which only developed countries should 
undertake.

<F P=106> [By Tonny Chan] </F>
  [Text] The government would still be able to function even 
if China fired all 14 top officials after 1997, Secretary for 
the Civil Service Michael Sze said. He made it clear that the 
government would move alone to appoint people to the top posts 
if the worst happened and relations between Hong Kong and China 
broke down. 
  Mr Sze's defiant remarks came after Chinese official Wang 
Fengchao, deputy director of the State Council's Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Office, said the Special Administrative Region 
(SAR) government would select its own officials to head the 
future Hong Kong administration. 
  "If there's no communication (with China) in the runup to 
1997, there'd still be the need to have people to do the job," 
Mr Sze said. "If the chief executive of the Special 
Administrative Region thinks he should change those officials, I 
believe the impact would not be great," he told a media 
reception. "This is because our civil service structure is 
stable and healthy. Every department knows its job." 
  He pointed out that department heads had been reshuffled 
regularly and deputies took over a top post until an appointment 
was made. "After Mrs Anson Chan was appointed Chief Secretary, 
deputy Secretary for the Civil Service, Stuart Harbinson, acted 
as the secretary until I took over the post," he said. It would 
be irresponsible for the future chief executive to sack senior 
officials for political reasons even though he had the authority 
to do so as the SAR's chief, he said. 
  Nine of the 14 secretary posts were occupied by locals 
without the right of abode in other countries and the remaining 
five--including the Secretary for Security--should be localised 
by 1996, Mr Sze said. He said the government would choose 
people who complied with the Basic Law requirements "on the 
surface". 
  "The expression `on the surface' is a responsible remark. 
  "I won't be able to know whether or not they will apply for 
a 
foreign passport in the future," Mr Sze said. When asked if he 
was referring to people hired on local terms, he said: "I mean 
people who look like you and me (ethnic Chinese)." 
  But he said it remained the government's wish to discuss the 
transition of senior civil servants with the Chinese authority. 
Mr Sze said he knew that many civil servants had fears about 
the future. "They are not worried that they may lose their jobs 
but they are worried about the future as an ordinary person in 
the street," he said. "The worry is understandable. 
  "They are also concerned whether there would be changes 
within the government."

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Lee, legislative councillor and chairman </F>
of the United Democrats of Hong Kong: "Dump This Colonial 
Baggage"] 
  [Text] Governor Patten enjoys a widespread reputation as a 
champion of press freedom. He has given numerous speeches 
around the world on the topic, at one recent lecture in Dublin 
declaring, "it would be the most seedy of betrayals" for 
broadcasters such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner to appease 
China by self-censoring for reasons of commercial expediency. 
  But back in Hong Kong, it is a different story. Governor 
Patten has consistently resisted calls from the Hong Kong 
community to strike from Hong Kong's law books the draconian 
colonial statutes which could be used to muzzle Hong Kong 
journalists after 1997. 
  Hong Kong's colonial legacy means that our statute books 
contain an array of repressive colonial-era laws -- laws that 
permit the colonial government to stifle press freedom and free 
expression in the name of public safety or good relations with 
other countries. With three short years until the transition of 
sovereignty to China, these anachronistic laws now constitute a 
major threat to our rule of law and freedom. 
  Colonial laws are not meant to protect rights, but to 
restrict them. As has been the case in almost all colonies -- 
where the government is not chosen by the democratically 
established consent of the governed -- the laws are designed 
principally to give whatever powers the government may need to 
control the local population. 
  There is already ample evidence that China will try to 
transfer its system of press controls to Hong Kong, as seen in 
China's recent treatment of Hong Kong journalists. Would it 
not, then, be the most seedy of betrayals for Governor Patten to 
fail to remove the most unfair vestiges of colonialism -- those 
laws which can be used to repress free speech and a free press? 
Soon after Mr Patten was named Governor, the Hong Kong 
Journalists' Association [HKJA] presented to him a list of the 
17 most repressive colonial-era laws, including the Emergency 
Regulations Ordinance, the Official Secrets Act, the Crimes 
Ordinance (dealing with treason and sedition), the Summary 
Offences Ordinance, the Police Force Ordinance and the Public 
Order Ordinance. These laws, among others, contain 
breathtakingly broad powers to crush freedom of expression and 
authorise censorship of all media. 
  A closer look at the Emergency Regulations Ordinance -- 
dating from 1992 -- illustrates the threat colonial laws pose to 
Hong Kong people's freedoms. The law reads: "On any occasion 
which the Governor in Council may consider to be an occasion of 
emergency or public danger he may make any regulations 
whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public 
interest." 
  The menace to press freedom is clear: the first power the 
statute grants to the executive branch is the blanket authority 
to censor the press and to issue regulations for "censorship, 
and the control and suppression of publication, writing, maps, 
plans, photographs, communications and means of communications". 
  Moreover, this power to declare an emergency is so vague and 
arbitrary that Governor Patten could wake up on the wrong side 
of the bed tomorrow and declare a state of emergency. 
Presumably he won't, but I do not need to point out the scope 
for abuse this law will present after 1997. 
  Governor Patten promised to give the Emergency Regulations 
Ordinance and the rest of the HKJA list urgent attention. That 
was well over a year ago. To date, only three of the 17 most 
egregious laws have been amended -- the Broadcasting Authority 
Ordinance, the Television Ordinance and the Telecommunication 
Ordinance. All of the other laws remain in effect. 
  The Governor's cavalier attitude towards press freedom is 
further reflected by the fact that he still continues to resist 
the numerous calls from the local community to establish an 
independent Human Rights Commission, and opposes an Access to 
Information Bill which would promote a truly open and 
accountable government. The Government also rejected my request 
to amend the Film Censorship Ordinance which allows films to be 
censored on the grounds of "damaging good relations with other 
territories" -- a provision used as recently as last January to 
challenge the Foreign Correspondents' Club showing of a BBC 
documentary about Mao. Because of the Government's refusal to 
act, I will move a private member's bill later this year to 
amend this colonial law. 
  Although Hong Kong is currently the freest society in Asia, 
since 1989 Hong Kong people have been all too aware of how 
fragile a commodity freedom is. In Hong Kong we assume that the 
rule of law means laws that protect our rights, freedoms and way 
of life. But when the laws themselves are bad, our freedoms are 
in great danger. 
  Thus far, these anachronistic laws restricting press freedom 
have not been widely abused because of the link to the UK's 
parliamentary democracy. While the colonial government is not 
accountable to Hong Kong people, it is accountable to a 
democratically elected British Parliament some 13,000 kilometres 
away. That is, if the Hong Kong government were to behave 
irresponsibly, heads could conceivably roll in Whitehall. But 
even this system of accountability once-removed will be removed 
along with the Union flag on June 30, 1997. 
  Whatever trust we put in the integrity of Hong Kong 
judiciary, judges must apply the law, and if the laws censor the 
press, even the best judge would have to rule as the law 
dictates. Clearly, if many of our draconian colonial laws 
remain after 1997, they will be legitimately available to later 
government officials to gag Hong Kong reporters. 
  The Singapore Internal Security Act is a sad case in point. 
This statute was left on the books when the British colonial 
administration departed from Singapore. Since that time, the 
Singapore government has used this law to suspend civil 
liberties and detain Singapore citizens indefinitely without 
trial. 
  Francis Seow, the former head of the Singapore Law Society, 
ran up against the Internal Security Act when he was punished in 
the name of public safety for disagreeing with the Singapore 
government. However ironic, the Singapore authorities can 
effectively silence their critics by pointing out that since the 
Internal Security Act was left by Britain -- a Western, 
democratic country -- it would be a double standard to suggest 
Singapore should not use this law as well. 
  Indeed, if we look around the region, the British colonial 
administration has a lousy track record of leaving such laws in 
the wake of a departure from former colonies. Malaysia, another 
former colonial holding, has a statute similar to the Internal 
Security Act which is also used to detain people for exercising 
their political rights. 
  The draconian laws on our statute books are like land mines. 
Like Singapore, Beijing will be only too happy to inherit these 
repressive colonial laws. It would be a great tragedy if 
Governor Patten and the colonial government are allowed to 
repeat this mistake in Hong Kong, the most successful British 
colony. Hong Kong people will suffer if these statutes are then 
used to lock up offending reporters or to stifle political 
dissent. Yet this is the course the British Government has set 
in refusing to expunge these laws from our legal system. 
  It is not enough for Governor Patten simply to lament the 
sad 
state of press freedom in Hong Kong. This is an executive-led 
government, and the executive has the power to introduce bills 
to amend or repeal these laws. But his government has not taken 
action thus far for much the same reason his colonial 
predecessors long shut the door on Hong Kong people's legitimate 
democratic aspirations: fear of offending China. 
  Especially in light of the obvious implications of the 
arrest 
of Xi Yang and other journalists, there can be no further 
justification (if indeed there ever was) for the Government's 
foot-dragging on reforming the colonial laws so open to abuse. 
  All our rights and freedoms are interlinked. Once press 
freedom is gone, none of our other freedoms -- including our 
free market and our free enterprise system -- is safe. Thus the 
obligation to repeal these colonial laws and set up democratic 
institutions to protect freedom is not just an administrative 
responsibility. It is also a moral one. It would be the height 
of hypocrisy for Governor Patten to leave Hong Kong with the 
knowledge that he has left in place the means to stifle our 
spirit of freedom. 
  Governor Patten, for all his oratory on the virtues of free 
expression, is on the verge of leaving behind a set of laws 
under which Hong Kong could have a bleak, Orwellian future. 
  Unless the Governor and his administration take immediate 
action it could yet be the ultimate irony that after 1997, 
Governor Patten's fine speeches on press freedom are banned in 
Hong Kong under colonial laws he himself left in place.

Government Information Co-ordinator] 
  [Text] Martin Lee seems to subscribe to the old adage that 
one should never let the facts get in the way of a good story. 
How else can one explain his statement that the Governor "has 
consistently resisted calls from the Hong Kong community to 
strike from Hong Kong's law books the draconian colonial 
statutes which could be used to muzzle journalists after 1997"? 
Let's put the facts on the record. 
  Soon after he arrived in Hong Kong as Governor in July 1992, 
Mr Patten met representatives of the Journalists Association. 
They presented him with a list of 17 laws which in their view 
were either an actual or a potential threat to press freedom. 
Mr Patten immediately agreed to conduct a review. 
  The review in fact covered 27 Ordinances (not the 17 
identified by the Journalists Association) and a total of 53 
separate provisions. The initial results of the review were 
reported to the Journalists Association and to the Legislative 
Council in March and April last year. 
  We have already amended three Ordinances, a further seven 
will be amended before the end of the year and we are still 
working on four Ordinances, i.e. the Crimes Ordinances, the 
Official Secrets Act, the Police Force Ordinance and the 
Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. 
  The remaining Ordinances have been reviewed, but we have 
concluded that, as they exist to protect the privacy of 
individuals, there is no case for amending or repealing them. 
The Government has a duty to protect the privacy of individuals 
as well as to protect the freedom of the press. 
  Far from resisting calls for action, the Government has 
moved 
quickly to identify the legal provisions which could jeopardise 
the freedom of the laws identified and we will complete work on 
the remaining four before the end of the year.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The fourth meeting of 
the social and security affairs panel under the Preliminary 
Working Committee [PWC] of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] ended in Beijing today. 
The meeting mainly discussed issues such as preparatory work 
regarding the design and issuance of the PRC's Hong Kong SAR 
passports, as well as issues pertaining to Hong Kong's social 
welfare, such as public housing and the retirement security 
system. 
  While discussing the issuance of Hong Kong SAR passports, 
PWC 
members noted: This task is of great importance to ensuring the 
freedom of entry and exit for Hong Kong residents, to 
strengthening Hong Kong's economic relations and trade with 
other countries and regions, and to maintaining Hong Kong's 
status as an international financial center. The members 
proposed: Hong Kong SAR passports should embody the spirit of 
"one country, two systems," and they should be issued in strict 
accordance with the Basic Law. To enable Hong Kong residents to 
use SAR passports on 1 July 1997, we should make advance 
preparations for the design, printing, and issuance of such 
passports. The members added: Our government will take active 
diplomatic actions with other countries and regions regarding 
mutual visa exemption arrangements for SAR passports; this is 
particularly important. They also noted: Besides SAR 
passports, preparations should also be made regarding SAR travel 
documents. 
  While discussing public housing policy that has a major 
bearing on Hong Kong's welfare, the panel decided to set up a 
public housing research group. To broadly canvass opinions in 
all quarters, some public figures in Hong Kong will be invited 
to serve as advisers to the research group. The panel also 
discussed the retirement security system. 
  The meeting was held in Beijing 16-17 May.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Passport Chaos Must Be Solved"] </F>
  [Text] There are some aspects of the 1997 issue which 
require unique responses from the two sides. The passport 
muddle, for example, cries out for cooperation, rather than 
sticking dogmatically to entrenched attitudes. This is a 
problem that must be dealt with expeditiously. Unfortunately, 
however, it has become another casualty of the Sino-British 
impasse. 
  Local holders of British National Overseas (BNO) passports 
now have the same rights as British citizens when it comes to 
such matters as visa-free entry to certain third countries. 
Britain is pushing for the same system to continue after 1997 
for BNO passport- holders. Hence the need for cooperation 
between Beijing and London. 
  Noting that this is a matter for the post-1997 Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong, China says: "This is 
a question of our sovereignty, we don't have to talk to Britain 
about it." So what we are probably going to see is two separate 
campaigns for Hong Kong passports. China will launch its own 
promotion for the SAR passport and Britain will try to push the 
BNO passport. 
  Commonsense indicates that it would be a lot simpler and a 
lot more effective if the two sides just joined forces to get 
the best possible deal from third countries as far as visas are 
concerned. But this is shaping up as another case where Hong 
Kong residents may suffer because both countries appear to be 
more concerned about their own national pride than with the 
welfare of the people of this territory. No one disputes that 
this problem must be sorted out as quickly as possible. Failure 
to do so will result in a bureaucratic nightmare after 1997. 
The SAR will have to issue millions of passports in a very 
short period of time. The earlier the relevant authorities get 
started on this process the better. 
  This, we submit, is where the Preliminary Working Committee 
(PWC) has a vital role to play. The PWC was set up by China 
last year to advise on transitional issues. This is a classic 
transitional issue. The mandate of reason and emergency is that 
PWC members should intercede. They must use their influence 
with China in an effort to persuade Beijing to talk to London. 
They would probably be effective because China should listen to 
its own advisory body. It would also be a test of whether the 
PWC is just a rubber stamp for Chinese decisions or whether it 
really does have some clout in advising Beijing.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Opinion" page: "New Members To Benefit </F>
PWC"] 
  [Text] The appointment of 13 more people to the 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), raising its numbers to 70 
must be welcomed, if only because there is so much to do to 
prepare for the handover of sovereignty in 1997. But more 
especially because some of these newcomers will be bringing to 
the PWC the expertise and experience hitherto lacking in its 
ranks. 
  The presence of Guo Fengmin, chief negotiator in the Joint 
Liaison Group (JLG), will be a boon, given that the PWC has to 
look into areas which must be resolved within the JLG. Mr Guo 
might understand better the feelings of Hong Kong members about 
the need to speed up and complete JLG work on matters such as 
the localisation of laws and ratification of international 
treaties for the post-1997 period. 
  Hong Kong members, on the other hand, might get to know and 
understand at first hand, the progress or otherwise of various 
JLG items. Perhaps, even help to give the Chinese side a push 
towards settlement of some of the outstanding issues. The 
addition of Hong Kong academics, a former member of the bench 
and a civil servant will enlarge PWC horizons. All these 
individuals are ideally placed to give the mainland members 
insights into areas of vital importance if confidence in the 
future Special Administrative Region Administration is to be 
built up. 
  Arthur Garcia, former civil servant, ex-High Court judge and 
newly-retired ombudsman, is most certainly in a position to give 
the mainland members a historical perspective of many of the 
existing laws vital to understanding the need to maintain or 
modify them for the post-colonial period. 
  Since its formation the PWC has been grossly misrepresented 
and misreported. It has not been helped by thoughtless remarks 
by some of its members. The result has been a general 
misunderstanding of its work and its role in the current, 
embittered situation arising from the failure of China and 
Britain to come to terms on political reforms for Hong Kong. It 
has also been handicapped by lack of resources and shortage of 
expertise in some areas. 
  The appointment of new members will not greatly help its 
image problem but it may at least lighten the burden of the few 
local members who are working unstintingly for Hong Kong's 
future. 
  But when all is said and done, the PWC must still win the 
confidence of Hong Kong people. This it has signally failed to 
do. Mainly because its approach to dealing with both the media 
and Hong Kong people is unbelievably antediluvian. This has to 
change. The PWC must strike out in new directions to instil 
confidence in the public at large. If the addition of new 
members helps it would be a plus.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 17 (XINHUA) -- Another H share of a 
state-owned enterprise from the Chinese mainland was today 
listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, thus bringing to eight 
the total number of such shares listed in the territory. 
  Tianjin Bohai Chemical Industry (Group) Company Limited 
(Tianjin Bohai), the largest marine chemical manufacturer in 
China, has issued a total of 340 million H shares in Hong Kong 
with each share valued at 1.2 HK [Hong Kong] dollars (0.15 U.S. 
cents). 
  The newly-issued H share today closed at 1.1 HK dollars on a 
turnover of 81 million shares on the Hong Kong stock market upon 
its first trading day. 
  Analysts here attributed the drop mainly to the fear of the 
possible increase of the U.S. dollar interest rate in the near 
future. 
  Cai Chaoqun, general manager of Tianjin Bohai, said that his 
company will bring the best possible returns to investors in the 
long run.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Posturing, Hypocrisy and MFN"] </F>
  [Text] Of all the stupid and ill-informed comments made in 
the course of the debate over the renewal of China's Most 
Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, the most stupid has now 
been made by George Mitchell, the leader of the Democratic 
majority caucus in the United States Senate. On Sunday [15 
May], Mitchell solemnly told the American public China needed to 
improve its human rights in the next two weeks. 
  Yes, two weeks is left for the Chinese government to change 
its human rights policy. 
  What is so daft and so objectionable about Mitchell's 
pronouncement is that, on the one hand, it is a totally 
unreasonable demand and on the other, he does not mean it. 
Mitchell, however, accurately reflects the dilemma of the 
Clinton administration, which has talked big about human rights 
in China and is looking for a way to act small so that MFN can 
be renewed with some kind of face-saving formula. 
  Now, we learn Wei Jingsheng, China's most famous dissident, 
only recently released from jail, is about to be charged with 
the capital crime of treason. His apparent offence? Urging the 
U.S. to withhold China's MFN status unless Beijing genuinely 
improves its human rights policy. China clearly had no 
intention of publicising the charges against Wei until after 
Washington had issued its expected decision to renew -- at least 
in substance -- China's MFN status. 
  The United States, prone to posturing, has its hands firmly 
tied by linking its avowed commitment to human rights with trade 
policy. Withholding MFN, as we have argued before, is a crude 
and inappropriate instrument for the purpose at hand. 
  But, having publicly adopted this stance, the U.S. should at 
least be seen to follow through on these principles. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher should at the very least press 
Beijing for an immediate clarification of Wei's status. If 
Clinton truly intends to make China's trade status conditional 
upon its human rights performance, then the prospect that 
China's most famous dissident may be charged with treason for 
remarks he made to the State Department's top human rights 
official is surely relevant. 
  China's policy makers have correctly sensed the uncertainty 
and lack of commitment in Washington and exploited it to the 
full. The traditional offerings of nominal dissident prison 
releases have been made, a few Christians here, the more 
prominent Chen Ziming there and, no doubt, a couple more 
releases to come as the June 3 deadline for an MFN decision 
draws close. 
  However, by word and by deed, the Chinese government has 
made 
it crystal clear it has no intention of making any fundamental 
changes to its human rights policy. The point was underscored 
when John Shattuck, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for 
Human Rights, visited China, and a number of human rights 
activists were rounded up under his very nose. 
  The interests of human rights in China are not advanced by 
mixing this issue with the recidivist protectionism of many 
vested interests in the United States. The annual sham of 
trading a few political prisoners for Chinese footware, etc. is 
neither dignified nor a suitable method of securing more 
far-reaching changes in the human rights situation. 
  We are sick and tired of the way in which the U.S. pursues 
its human rights policy. We should add that China is not a 
special case; the Clinton administration's bungling and 
ineptitude is equally evident in the tragedies that have 
befallen Haiti and Rwanda. However, we are based in Hong Kong, 
so we have parochial interests in the affairs of our big 
neighbour and the repercussions of these affairs on our 
circumstances. 
  We suspect the government has overstated the impact of 
losing 
MFN status for the Hong Kong economy. We are also suspicious 
about other figures being pumped out, purporting to demonstrate 
the impact of losing MFN. None of this really matters, however, 
because the MFN charade is likely to run for a little while yet, 
without anyone seriously losing or gaining trading advantages as 
a result. 
  What matters is the situation of human rights, an issue 
somewhat sidetracked in the MFN debate. So let us state clearly 
what we fear. We fear that the human rights situation is 
deteriorating. We fear, but cannot quantify the extent of the 
deterioration, because controls on the media are being stepped 
up. 
  When President Jiang Zemin chooses to tell the world that 
the 
Tiananmen massacre was worthwhile, when even the most famous 
dissidents cannot be protected by their international fame and 
when the international community chooses to acknowledge its 
impotence with a collective shrug of the shoulders at events in 
China, then things are serious. 
  The time will come when recognition of this serious matter 
will not be obscured by the MFN debate. It cannot come too soon.

  [Text] Macao, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Infrastructural 
construction of Lin Seng Industrial Development Zone on Macao's 
Coloane Island is going to be started at the end of this month 
and is expected to be completed by next May. 
  According to an official with the project, the industrial 
zone covers an area of 337,000 sq m, of which 120,000 sq m are 
for industrial development, 110,000 sq m for construction of 
roads, some 8,000 sq m for grassland, 30,000 sq m for public 
facilities and the rest for commercial and residential use. 
  Costing an estimated 100 million Macao patacas (13 million 
U.S. dollars), the infrastructural construction mainly covers 
water routes, roads, afforestation, running water facilities, 
power and telecommunications network. 
  The official said, at present, enterprises from the 
Zhongshan 
harbor high-tech development zone, Guangdong Province, have 
handed over six project letters to Macao government for 
approval. These projects cover electronics, machinery, 
battery-making and others. 
  Macao government stipulated that construction terms for all 
projects in the industrial zone would end before 1999, the 
official said. 
  Approved by Macao government in 1975, the industrial zone is 
expected to boost the multi-facet and high-tech industrial 
development in Macao.

<F P=106> [By P.C. Tang and Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, May 17 (CNA) -- Taiwan hopes to become a 
founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), Taiwan's 
Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng said here Tuesday 
[17 May]. 
  "So we hope we can be admitted to the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) by the end of this year," Sheu stressed 
at the opening session of the fifth meeting of the GATT working 
party screening Taiwan's membership application. 
  The Geneva-based world trade regulatory body is scheduled to 
be superceded by the WTO early next year. 
  In preparation for joining GATT, Sheu said, Taiwan is ready 
to open its merchandise and service markets. "We are also 
determined to abide by the GATT-initiated trips (trade 
related-aspects of intellectual property rights) regulations," 
he added. 
  Sheu continued that Taiwan has adjusted its trade regime to 
meet GATT requirements. In addition to slashing tariff rates 
for a number of industrial and agricultural products, Taiwan 
will also gradually open its telecommunications, tourism, 
construction and financial markets to foreign companies. "We'll 
also revise our copyrights, trademark and patent laws to comply 
with trips provisions," Sheu said. 
  He further promised that Taiwan will begin consultations 
with 
GATT contracting parties on the signing of agreements on 
government procurement soon after it joins the organization. 
  By signing such accords, Taiwan will allow foreign companies 
to bid for its public construction and government procurement 
projects, valued at more than US$20 billion annually. 
  Taiwan originally planned to sign such accords one year 
after 
its accession to GATT. Pressured by many GATT members, Taiwan 
has decided to start such negotiations upon its entry, but it 
will follow the South Korean example requiring those accords not 
to take effect until 1997. 
  Sheu also presented a written statement detailing Taiwan's 
plan to overhaul its decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly 
system in accordance with GATT requirements. 
  Sheu asked GATT contracting parties to submit lists of 
products for which they want Taiwan to cut tariffs and lists of 
services they hope Taiwan will open to foreign investment before 
the end of July to speed up Taiwan's GATT entry. 
  Sheu said Taiwan hopes to begin discussion on the protocol 
defining Taiwan's GATT accession in the next meeting of the 
working party. "We hope the sixth meeting of the working party 
can be held in late July," he added. 
  In a meeting with GATT Deputy Director-General Warren 
Lavorel, sheu said GATT should give Taiwan a 10-year adjustment 
period before it fully opens its rice market now that South 
Korea, a GATT member, has that grace period. 
  Sheu is heading a 33-member delegation to the fifth 
multilateral meeting on Taiwan's GATT bid, which will last 
through Thursday. 
  In addition to multilateral discussions, the Taiwan 
delegation will also hold formal or informal bilateral tariff 
concession talks with several GATT members, including Japan, the 
European Union, Switzerland, Colombia, Mexico and South Korea, 
during its stay here.

  [Text] Concerning the U.S. State Department's reiteration 
of its one China policy, Presidential Office Spokesman Tai 
Jui-ming pointed out that one China is an unrealized goal 
pursued by our country. China currently consists of two 
political entities. The Republic of China is a sovereign 
country in Taiwan and on Penghu [Pescadores], Chinmen [Quemoy] 
and Matsu islands. There is no question at all on this issue. 
The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are being governed 
separately. The Republic of China and the People's Republic of 
China [zhong hua ren min gong he guo 0022 5478 0086 3046 0364 
0735 0948] are not under the jurisdiction of each other's rule. 
Therefore, when we talk about a unified China, we must not 
forget that a unified China is a goal which is not yet realized. 
It is hoped that the U.S. State Department's policy of 
advocating one China is also a goal. It is hoped that all 
countries in the world will look squarely at this fact.

  [Text] Taipei, May 17 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
will not voluntarily sever diplomatic relations with South 
Africa even if Pretoria decides to establish formal ties with 
Beijing, Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu said Tuesday [17 May]. 
  Chien made the remarks when he was asked during an 
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan on how well the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for South Africa's 
possible diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing, an "old 
friend" in South African President Nelson Mandela's terms. 
  He said Pretoria may choose to recognize both Taipei and 
Beijing, which would benefit Taipei because other countries 
might then be prompted to follow suit. And such a policy on the 
part of South Africa would not mean Taiwan has abandoned its 
"one-China" policy, he asserted. 
  But he added that Taiwan has "no right to snoop into South 
Africa's external relations," saying it was up to Pretoria to 
decide with whom to make friends.

  [Text] On the question of our country's diplomatic 
relations with the Republic of South Africa [RSA], Foreign 
Minister Chien Fu yesterday [17 May] said at the Legislative 
Yuan that, after President Li's visit to South Africa, it has 
been proven that bilateral relations between our country and 
South Africa are very solid. He said that, in the future, our 
country would not interfere with South African Government's 
selection of friends. Our country would not voluntarily sever 
diplomatic relations if South Africa establishes diplomatic 
relations with Communist China. Even if it creates the issue of 
dual recognition, it would benefit our side because other 
countries might then be prompted to follow suit. 
  Minister Chien Fu said: [Begin recording] Are we going to 
sever relations with South Africa if South Africa wants to 
establish diplomatic relations with Communist China but 
continues to maintain diplomatic relations with us and does not 
sever relations with us? Concerning this question, I wish to 
provide an explanation. The foreign relations of the Republic 
of China are always based on one principle -- that is, we 
sincerely want to establish relations with all peace-loving 
countries in the world. What is important to us is our 
relations with individual countries. As to the handling of 
other diplomatic affairs by those countries, they are within the 
sovereign rights of that country and we cannot interfere with 
the diplomatic affairs of that country. Therefore, we attach 
importance to South Africa specifically in terms of our 
bilateral diplomatic relations with that country. We should not 
interfere with South Africa's choice of friends in its foreign 
affairs. We will definitely not sever diplomatic relations with 
South Africa if it establishes diplomatic relations with a 
certain regime or country. [end recording] 
  The above remarks were made by Minister Chien Fu when 
answering interpellations at the Legislative Yuan.

  [Text] Taipei, May 16 (CNA) -- Foreign Minister Fredrick 
F. Chien said Monday [16 May] that President Li's 13-day, 
four-nation visit has contributed greatly to the strengthening 
of Taiwan's relationships with both friendly countries and those 
countries with which it does not maintain formal diplomatic ties. 
  Chien, who was a member of President Li's entourage during 
the overseas trip, made the remarks at a press conference. 
  President Li returned home Monday afternoon after visiting 
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, South Africa and Swaziland. 
  Chien said that Li had met with around 30 heads of state 
during his stay in South Africa. 
  He said he would like to use the Chinese proverb, "I will do 
what I should do no matter how difficult it is," to describe 
what Li had done and his dedication in expanding Taiwan's 
diplomatic arena. 
  Chien, however, denied news reports that Li met with 
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong during his stopover at 
Singapore's Chang Kai-shek International Airport on Monday 
morning. 
  He said Li only had a 30-minute meeting with Ker Sin Tze 
[name and title as received], Singapore's state minister for 
information, arts, and education.
