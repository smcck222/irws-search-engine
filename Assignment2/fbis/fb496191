  [Text] Hong Kong, May 20 (CNS)--Policy-oriented dialogue 
should be made between the two sides of the strait under the 
premise of one China in order not to bring cross-strait 
relations to a deadlock, the Chairman of the Taiwan Straits 
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Mr Koo Chen-fu said yesterday. He 
added that some Taiwan officials in charge of decision-making on 
the Mainland policy showed differences with Mr Li Teng-hui on 
his idea of the Mainland policy. The SEF chairman said that the 
level which was responsible for such decision-making should be 
upgraded to a higher level. 
  Mr Koo pointed out that the cross-strait relations was 
considered the most important in Taiwan's external relations. 
He added that he expected tense state in relations between the 
two sides of the strait in coming August and September when 
Taiwan would raise the issue of participation in the United 
Nations. With this in mind he said that it was necessary for 
the two sides to hold negotiation and that policy-oriented 
dialogue should be made based on the framework of one China. 
The SEF chief added that should no talk between the two sides 
take place, it would lead to an impasse which was not beneficial 
for the two sides of the strait. 
  The officials in the Mainland in charge of decision-making 
on 
the Taiwan policy were the officials at the top, according to Mr 
Koo. In Taiwan it was another case. The Mainland policy held by 
some Taiwan officials was different from that of Mr Li Teng-hui 
while some officials just guessed at what kind of idea the 
higher level held in regard to the Mainland policy or even based 
on speculations. Mr Koo, therefore, has long since advocated 
that the level responsible for decision-making on the Mainland 
policy should be raised to a higher level. 
  The SEF chairman was convinced that the routine consultation 
across the strait did not go conflict with dialogue between the 
high levels of the two sides. He said it did not matter even 
though no favorable outcome was made from such dialogue. Mr Koo 
believed that mutual trust would be built up mainly by means of 
frequent face-to-face communications. He suggested that the 
routine talks between the two sides should cover economic topics 
in addition to the current agenda.

  [Text] Taipei, May 20 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui told 
the National Assembly on Friday [19 May] that under no 
circumstances will the Republic of China [ROC] change its name, 
flag or anthem. 
  Several members of the National Assembly had suggested 
during 
the current session that Taiwan follow the example of South 
Africa in adopting a new flag and anthem. 
  Li said, however, that the conditions under which South 
Africa made the changes aren't the same as those in Taiwan. 
  The DPP [Democratic Progressive Party] in a statement issued 
late in the afternoon said that the existing national flag and 
anthem were adopted from the Kuomintang's flag and song without 
the consent of people in the Taiwan area, and thus represent 
neither Taiwan nor China. 
  It said that a nation must change its name, flag and anthem 
following changes in its territory and population structure. 
  Li also urged the DPP, Taiwan's leading opposition party, to 
"value the free and democratic system and dedicate itself to the 
solidarity and construction of the island." By so doing, he 
said, the DPP may win greater support than the ruling Kuomintang 
from the people. 
  Though Friday was the fourth anniversary of Li's 
inauguration, he was attending the National Assembly session as 
scheduled to hear a national-affairs discussion and answer 
questions raised by assembly members. 
  Meanwhile, according to National Assembly Secretary-General 
Chen Chin-jang, Li has agreed that after the end of the session, 
he will meet small groups of assembly members one or two times 
each month to solicit their opinions on national affairs. 
  The National Assembly began its three-month special session 
on May 2 in Yangmingshan to consider amendments to the 
constitution and the nominations by President Li of grand 
justices and the head of the Judicial Yuan.

<F P=106> [Article by Chief Secretary Anson Chan Fang on-sang: "My </F>
Plea to Clinton: No Trade Sanctions"] 
  [Text] My visit to Washington and New York three weeks ago 
was an excellent opportunity to reinforce cordial relations with 
the United States. I was impressed in my meetings by the 
interest and goodwill felt towards Hong Kong and China by 
leading figures in government, the U.S. Congress and business 
community. I came away encouraged by a belief there was a good 
deal of common ground on which to forge a closer understanding 
between the Chinese and American people. 
  An item high on my agenda was the United States' annual 
renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. 
It is a debate we in Hong Kong have watched with anxiety for 
five consecutive years. Some have become dismissive of the 
threat but it is probably more threatening now than previously. 
  There are deep concerns in the United States about human 
rights. The choice President Bill Clinton now faces is a 
difficult one: how to avoid a destructive confrontation with 
China without appearing to compromise the human rights issue on 
which he has placed so much emphasis. Whatever he decides, 
concern in the U.S. and elsewhere about human rights in China is 
not going to disappear. It will be a recurring theme that 
requires a means of expression. But it would be in all our 
interests to find a means of doing so without a direct 
confrontation over economics and trade. 
  If something good has come of this painful annual process, 
it 
is the way that it has encouraged discussion of human rights, a 
matter of great importance to us all as Hong Kong prepares for a 
change in sovereignty. It is not something we can sweep under 
the carpet. There may be different ways to approach it but 
constant effort to improve human rights is fundamental to the 
development of civilised society. The question is not whether 
to seek to promote respect for human rights but how best to do 
it. Those of us in the Hong Kong Government have consistently 
maintained threatening trade sanctions is not the best way. I 
made the point forcefully on many occasions during my U.S. trip 
and many agreed with me. 
  Trade is one of the oldest and purest forms of international 
cooperation. It brings people together, creates wealth and 
progress and encourages changes. Its effects on southern China 
are a good example. Lifestyles for millions of people have 
improved for the better, with not only the comforts and 
convenience of consumer goods such as refrigerators and 
motorbikes, but also televisions and fax machines that bring the 
outside world closer. Freedom of movement, choice of 
occupation, readiness to speak out are all far greater than 
could have been imagined a decade ago. 
  The economic growth which trade brought to southern China 
has 
not been without its drawbacks. The transition from an agrarian 
to an industrial economy has been a difficult one. Worker 
rights, worker safety and environmental protection, for example, 
require the discipline of regulatory standards that are only 
patchy at first and take education and resources to develop. 
Trade produces both, particularly trade with a country such as 
the U.S. which is concerned about these issues. Reduce that 
trade and the good influence diminishes. Expand the trade and 
the free flow of ideas will become a flood. Many people in the 
U.S. are persuaded by these arguments. They want to keep doing 
business with China, both because they believe it is in the 
economic interests of the U.S. but also because they see a trade 
conflict with China would actually undermine human rights there. 
They believe developing trading links would increase 
opportunities for dialogue and change. 
  The "Hong Kong argument" also carries weight in Washington. 
Of course there are public misconceptions about Hong Kong in 
the U.S. and we are doing our best to correct them. But among 
political leaders and opinion formers there is a remarkably good 
understanding of Hong Kong's significance in this region as a 
gateway to China. It is also a model of free trade, business 
enterprise and good administration, a platform for U.S. business 
in Asia and an economic dynamo for the region. There is great 
reluctance to do anything which would penalise Hong Kong or make 
life more difficult for us at such a challenging time in our 
history. 
  Some I met knew something of the importance of Hong Kong to 
China and the region but had not appreciated just how damaging 
withdrawal of China's MFN trading status would be to Hong Kong's 
economy. The fact two-thirds of foreign investment in China 
originated from Hong Kong surprised them as did the two-thirds 
of China's exports to the U.S. and one-third of American goods 
going to China which passed through Hong Kong. I took the 
opportunity to provide our latest analysis of the economic 
impact of MFN withdrawal on Hong Kong -- up to 75,000 jobs lost 
and GDP growth cut by between 2.2 and 3.1 per cent. There is no 
doubt the immediate impact of MFN withdrawal would be severe. I 
went on to point out Hong Kong managed to sustain impressive 
confidence about its future, thanks largely to its healthy 
economy. The success of closer economic co-operation between 
Hong Kong and China helped win acceptance in Hong Kong that its 
future was inextricably linked with China's. Diminish that 
economic success and it would be a great deal more difficult to 
sustain confidence in Hong Kong as we approach 1997. It is a 
depressing argument to use but it carried weight with those in 
the U.S. concerned about this region and American interests here. 
  Of course it is possible, or even likely, MFN will not be 
withdrawn totally this year and instead some form of selective 
sanction imposed. I made it clear I thought quite apart from 
the practical difficulties of, for example, attempting to 
distinguish between goods produced by state and non-state 
enterprises, there were considerable risks. In addition, the 
introduction of any form of trade sanctions created uncertainty 
for Hong Kong because it was impossible to insulate the 
territory from the effect of sanctions against China and the 
almost inevitable retaliation. 
  Each of these arguments is a case for renewing MFN without 
conditions. Taken together, they make a strong case for 
pursuing concerns about human rights in a way that does not 
threaten trade and economic ties. 
  This was the first time a chief secretary of Hong Kong has 
been received at the White House by an American vice-president. 
It was a public recognition of how important Hong Kong has 
become to the U.S. and an important demonstration of goodwill 
and support. It was also, I believe, a recognition the Hong 
Kong Government's position on the MFN issue is being taken 
seriously. It is certainly a position we intend to stick to.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Chris Patten Is Playing the Human Rights Card"] </F>
  [Text] On 20 May, Chris Patten returned to Britain to 
"report on his work" for one week. It was said that he would 
discuss with John Major and Douglas Hurd the issue of setting up 
a "Human Rights Committee," as proposed by the report of the 
Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British Parliament. 
This shows that Patten is going further and further along the 
course of confrontation. He has not only ripped up the rails 
for convergence with the Basic law and tried to unilaterally set 
up a political structure and impose it on the government of the 
Special Administrative Region [SAR] beyond 1997, but also plans 
to set the time bomb of a "human rights committee," revise a 
series of laws in Hong Kong, and broaden the room for maneuver 
for international forces in an attempt to create discord, 
turmoil, and confrontation after 1997. 
  Patten's "three violations" are aimed at establishing a 
pro-British and anti-China political body in Hong Kong and then 
imposing it on the SAR. The plan for establishing a human 
rights committee is also aimed at resisting China's sovereign 
power, expanding the room for political maneuver, introducing 
international political forces into Hong Kong, and thus turning 
Hong Kong into a "political city." In this way, Britain may 
continue to control Hong Kong's politics in reality after it 
returns Hong Kong to China nominally. 
  The report of the British Parliament "proposed" that the 
Hong 
Kong Government set up a "human rights committee" and a "human 
rights supervision organ" before 1997 so that they might 
continue to exert international pressure on China after 1997 
through "joint supervision over the development of the human 
rights situation in Hong Kong after 1997" by the British 
Government and the UN Human Rights Committee. 
  China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong 
as of 1 July 1997. Britain has no right to influence anything 
on China's territory and within the scope of China's internal 
affairs, still less can it exercise any "supervision" over Hong 
Kong affairs through a so-called human rights committee. In 
addition to the attempt to maintain its influence in Hong Kong, 
the plan to establish a "human rights committee" also shows that 
Britain has the ambition of changing China's current system and 
territory. The report by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee 
not only meddles in Hong Kong's post-1997 affairs, but also has 
a hand in Taiwan and Tibetan affairs. Britain tries to harbor 
such people as Han Dongfang and allow them to use Hong Kong as a 
springboard to enter the mainland for setting up liberal trade 
unions and overthrowing the socialist system. Britain also 
repeatedly interferes in such cases as that of Xi Yang in order 
to support and protect people who use Hong Kong as a base for 
buying, prying into, and stealing China's political, military, 
and economic secrets and thus endangering China's security. 
Britain continues to support such organizations as the 
"Alliance in Support of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement in 
China," which is hostile to China and attempts to disrupt Hong 
Kong's stability, and allows it to continue its "yellow bird 
action" and stretch its sinister hand into the mainland. 
  There also exist human rights problems in Britain. People of 
Asian and African origin cannot enjoy equal treatment there, and 
the demand of the people in Northern Ireland for independence is 
suppressed cruelly. International human rights organizations 
and the United States have interfered in and criticized such 
events. However, Britain has not enacted its own "human rights 
law" or set up a "human rights committee" in order to meet the 
needs of guaranteeing human rights in its own country. Why so? 
Britain fails to give any explanation, but it has formulated a 
human rights law and is planning to set up a human rights 
committee in Hong Kong shortly before its withdrawal from Hong 
Kong. Obviously, it harbors sinister intentions when doing this. 
  An ancient Chinese saying goes that "one should not impose 
anything one does not like on other people." Britain does not 
want to see other countries interfere in affairs within its own 
sovereign power, does not want to see foreign forces interfere 
in the Northern Ireland issue, and does not want to see any 
international organizations supervise its human rights 
situation. Why did it do all this against China? 
  Over more than 100 years of British rule in Hong Kong, 
Britain declared that some provisions of the international human 
rights convention which it had signed were not applicable in 
Hong Kong, and Britain also opposed deleting Hong Kong from its 
list of colonies. Historical facts show that Britain had no 
sincerity on giving democracy and human rights to Hong Kong. 
Obviously it was for sinister purposes that it began to 
introduce such things only when it would soon withdraw from Hong 
Kong. 
  Many countries in the world do not have a "human rights 
committee." The United States, Britain, Japan, and many other 
countries have not set up human rights committees. However, 
such committees have been set up in Canada and Australia, two of 
Britain's former colonies. The practical results there are not 
commendable. Enterprise management is made a mess of; large 
numbers of suits pile up year on year; large amounts of public 
money are wasted; right and wrong are lumped together; even 
gangsters and tax evaders can enjoy various strange "human 
rights" and can even make a fortune by filing countercharges. 
Now Britain is trying to impose on Hong Kong such a human 
rights committee, which has proved unsuccessful and which may 
produce many side effects. This is completely another political 
trick before its withdrawal from a colony. 
  The Basic Law includes sufficient provisions guaranteeing 
human rights. In all countries, the guarantees of human rights 
of their own people can only be effected through their own 
sovereign power and their own legal systems. The establishment 
of a human rights committee in Hong Kong outside the framework 
of the Basic Law before Britain's withdrawal will only disrupt 
the administrative, judicial, and legislative operation of the 
future SAR Government, and may even throw things into chaos. 
Therefore, such an organization illegally set up by the 
colonialists is out of line with the Basic Law and is bound to 
be disbanded after 1997. 
  People have noted that when the British side was talking 
about the improvement of relations with China, Patten again 
began to play the "human rights card." What is his political 
purpose? How far does he plan to go along the course of 
worsening Sino-British relations?

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 May (XINHUA) -- At the 1994 China 
international high-level economic forum in Beijing, the leading 
officials of some economic affairs departments of the Chinese 
Government extensively reported on the status of reforms of the 
economic structure in various areas and on the strategic ideas 
for carrying out such reforms. The reports commanded broad 
interest from the participants. Economic experts and 
entrepreneurs from various countries spoke highly of China's 
tremendous achievements in reform and opening up, offering many 
valuable opinions and suggestions for reforming China's economic 
structure through discussions and replies to relevant questions. 
  The two-day, high-level economic forum concluded at the 
China 
World Hotel today. During yesterday's and today's sessions, 
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission; Gui Shiyong, vice minister of the State Planning 
Commission; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation; Finance Minister Liu Zhongli; Chen Yuan, vice 
president of the People's Bank of China; and Liu Hongru, 
chairman of the China Securities Supervision and Administration 
Committee, reported on the status of and prospects for reforms 
in their respective fields. 
  Speaking of the strategic ideas for China's enterprise 
reform, Wang Zhongyu said: In carrying out this reform, we aim 
to strengthen enterprise-related legislation and place 
enterprise reform within the legal framework, with the general 
goal of establishing a socialist market economic structure. We 
also seek to further improve the system of legal persons in the 
form of enterprises while carrying out reform of property rights 
in enterprises, and to further change enterprises' operating 
mechanisms while following the basic course of instituting a 
modern enterprise system. We aim to create a favorable external 
environment for deepening enterprise reform while closely 
meshing such reform with the efforts to establish a market 
network, to reform the macroeconomic management system, and to 
institute a social security system. The ultimate goal of 
enterprise reform is to make enterprises more dynamic and to 
improve their economic efficiency as much as possible. 
  After reporting on the substantial progress in reforming the 
planning and investment structures, Gui Shiyong analyzed the 
current major problems in the planning and investment 
structures. He noted: These problems include the failure to 
fully harness market forces in those economic activities in 
which market forces should play their roles and enterprises 
should make decisions independently; some of those activities 
have even been subject to improper administrative interference. 
A macroeconomic regulatory and control system, which satisfies 
market economic demands, has yet to be established, and there is 
a lack of effective mechanisms based on the combination of 
various regulatory and control means. New functions, contents, 
and methods of planning have yet to be explored, and there are 
not enough strategic, macroeconomic, and policy-oriented plans. 
The extent of participation by people in planning is relatively 
small, and the legal footing of planning work remains rather 
fragile. A risk-control mechanism in connection with investment 
has yet to be instituted, and the practice of "eating from the 
same big pot" has not yet been truly shattered. These problems 
need to be solved by continuing to deepen reform. 
  In noting the striking differences between the new reform 
of the foreign trading system currently under way in China and 
the reform carried out over the past 15 years, Wu Yi said: The 
current reform of the foreign trading system is proceeding 
simultaneously and in concert with reforms in other key sectors 
of the national economy -- finance, taxation, banking, 
investment, planning, foreign exchange, and the enterprise 
system. The current reform has never been more extensive, 
forceful, and difficult. Our reform plan was hatched after 
conducting investigations and studies over an extended period of 
time, summing up reform-related experience over the past 15 
years, and drawing on the successful practices of foreign 
countries. In the current favorable domestic and foreign 
environment, the opportunity for carrying out reform is quite 
good, and the conditions for doing so exist. 
  After discussing the satisfactory results of the way the new 
financial and taxation systems operate, Liu Zhongli said: Some 
foreign media recently reported that we are trying to mitigate 
the central government's financial troubles by increasing 
enterprises' tax burdens and collecting more local financial 
revenues; such reports are groundless. Under the current 
financial and taxation reform, the central government will not 
collect a single cent from local governments' existing financial 
revenues; it will only claim a slightly larger share of any 
additional financial revenues. Local governments understand and 
support this move. As for enterprises' tax burdens, the 
country's general ledger is designed in such a way that no 
increases in such burdens will be reflected; however, some 
increases or decreases in individual enterprises' tax burdens 
are normal because of the changes in the tax structure. 
  Chen Yuan explained the prime goals for the future reform of 
the banking system. These include the establishment of a 
central banking system that implements independent monetary 
policy under the State Council's leadership; the establishment 
of a network of banking institutions that undertake separate 
policy-related and commercial banking business, with state-owned 
commercial banks playing a dominant role among other banking 
institutions that exist side-by-side; and the establishment of a 
unified, open, and strictly managed network of banking markets 
which permit orderly competition. 
  In discussing the opening of China's stock markets to 
foreign 
companies, Liu Hongru said: Some foreign companies have 
expressed the hope of issuing shares on China's stock markets. 
Although China's stock markets are currently closed to foreign 
companies, they will open up gradually over the long term, in 
the same way as other commodity markets have. We are carefully 
studying relevant proposals made by foreign companies. 
  In his closing address, Li Tieying, state councilor and 
concurrently minister in charge of the State Economic 
Restructuring Commission, said: This international seminar has 
been a complete success, having attained the goal of further 
enhancing mutual understanding between China and the rest of the 
world, and of expanding cooperation and trade contacts between 
China and other countries and regions. He noted: As China 
enters a new era of full-scale socialist economic construction, 
it doubly needs to increase exchanges and cooperation with other 
countries. China will not change its policy of opening up to 
the outside world, nor will it change its policy of actively 
supporting and encouraging foreign investment.

<F P=106> [By LIEN HO PAO's Mainland News Center: "The Strike of </F>
20,000 Workers Shocks Jiang Zemin, Dalian Will Enact the 
Mainland's First Regulations on Strikes"] 
  [Text] The coming issue of ASIAWEEK, to be published soon, 
will carry a report about the recent labor unrest in mainland 
China. A strike of 20,000 workers has shocked the mainland 
authorities. In an important speech, CPC General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin listed eight hidden perils on the mainland, the 
first of which was worker strikes. 
  The eight hidden perils enumerated by Jiang Zemin were: 1) 
The serious decline in the business results of state-owned 
enterprises has resulted in unemployment among the workers and 
has led to strikes in Wuhan and Shenyang. 2) There were poor 
harvests of grain and cotton; a large area of farmland was left 
uncultivated; and many young peasants left the countryside. 3) 
Foreign trade was set back by several foreign countries' 
antidumping policies. 4) The inflow of large quantities of 
foreign goods caused domestic trade to shrink. 5) The masses 
are very unhappy about the corruption within the CPC. 6) The 
relationship between the central and local authorities is not 
harmonious. 7) The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, 
which is on the verge of breaking out, is threatening China's 
security. 8) The United States and other western countries are 
using human rights to pressure the mainland authorities. 
  As far as worker strikes are concerned, approximately 20,000 
coal miners in Shuangyashan and Jiamusi of Heilongjiang have 
reportedly staged a strike. As instructed by the higher 
authorities, some large enterprises in Harbin set up special 
leading groups to prevent and deal with possible labor unrest, 
which could break out suddenly. 
  In addition, more than 2,000 workers in a Zhuhai factory 
staged a three-day strike to protest against the management's 
attempt to lower their wages. In Dalian, more than 6,900 
workers in a company went on strike for four to five days in a 
bid to obtain a pay rise and improved working conditions. 
  Strikes occurred successively in state-owned enterprises in 
Shenyang and Wuhan and shocked Zhongnanhai, forcing the mainland 
authorities to adopt some emergency measures. In his speech, 
Jiang Zemin acknowledged that strikes had occurred in Wuhan and 
Shenyang. He reiterated the need to serve the working class 
wholeheartedly, called for prudent arrangements in the adoption 
of reform measures, and warned that "workers must not be driven 
to the streets." 
  At the same time, Jiang Zemin also expressed concern over 
the 
failures of grain crops and cotton and the exodus of the rural 
population. 
  The situation for workers in state-owned enterprises has 
been 
getting worse. More and more state-owned enterprises are going 
to be closed down or sold, and this will mean that workers will 
lose their jobs as well as their basic means of livelihood.

  [Text] Zhengzhou, May 22 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zhu 
Rongji has recently stressed that implementing the agricultural 
policies and efficiently running the state-owned enterprises are 
the keys to developing the good economic situation and 
stabilizing the overall situation at present. 
  Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the 
Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party 
of China (CPC), presided over two economic forums respectively 
at Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province, and 
Zhengzhou, capital of Central China's Henan Province, from May 
13 to 22. He also inspected the production of grain and cotton 
in Hubei and Henan Provinces. 
  Attending the two forums were leading officials of the 
ministries and departments under the State Council, who gave a 
brief introduction to the current macro national economic 
situation and a plan for reforming the system of grain purchase 
and sale. Also present at the first forum were leaders of the 
four provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi, and present 
at the second were leaders of the three provinces of Hebei, 
Shandong and Henan. They delivered reports on their local 
current economic situation. 
  Vice-Premier Zhu said at the forums that in order to 
consolidate and develop the current good economic situation, 
leading officials at all levels should lay emphasis in their 
economic work on promoting agriculture and running state-owned 
enterprises. This is at present the key to handling the 
relations between reform, development and stability, he added. 
  He stressed that it is necessary to conscientiously 
implement 
all the agricultural policies of the CPC Central Committee and 
the State Council, fully arouse the farmers' enthusiasm for 
growing grain and cotton, and strive for bumper harvests of both 
grain and cotton to lay a solid material foundation for 
effectively bringing the prices under control. 
  Meanwhile, Vice-Premier Zhu said, it is imperative to make 
thorough surveys of the conditions of enterprises, help them to 
solve their problems, further deepen the reform of state-owned 
enterprises, transform their operational mechanism, and make the 
experiment in establishing a modern enterprise system successful. 
  He said that at present, the national economic situation is 
very good and reforms in various fields are proceeding smoothly 
and are being constantly improved. The new systems have 
gradually become situated on the right track. Practice has 
proved that the series of decisions on strengthening and 
improving macro control and further deepening the reform to 
restructure the economy made by the CPC Central Committee with 
Jiang Zemin as the core is fully correct and has won support 
from the broad masses of the people and is highly regarded by 
the world. 
  The vice-premier stressed the importance of promoting 
agriculture. He pointed out that in the first four months of 
this year, the tendency toward excessive increases in investment 
in fixed assets has been brought under control, that the prices 
of capital goods have started to fall again, and the supply of 
industrial consumer goods is rich and the prices tend to be 
stable. Therefore, he said, the major tasks in bringing 
inflation under control and maintaining social stability are to 
further implement the spirit of the National Conference on Rural 
Work, or to promote the production of grain, cotton, edible oil 
and vegetables. 
  At present, he stressed, all localities should make every 
effort to accomplish the purchase of the summer crop's grain and 
oil- bearing farm produce and to strengthen the administration 
of the grain and edible oil market. 
  Zhu also said that at present, the tendency of the reform 
and 
development of state-owned enterprises is good. The profits of 
the enterprises in the first four months of this year did not 
drop but increased compared to the same period last year and the 
percentage of enterprises with general debility decreased rather 
than rising, he said. 
  However, he said, a few state-owned enterprises, mainly 
small 
and medium-sized ones, are indeed faced with under-capacity 
operation or even shut-downs. He called on leading officials of 
economic ministries and departments concerned and banks to take 
the lead in going deep into the grassroots units to make surveys 
and help the enterprises to resume production and get out of 
these predicaments. 
  He also said that those enterprises which have recorded 
losses for a long period and have no hope to make up deficits 
should declare bankruptcy according to the law after making good 
preparations.

<F P=106> [By reporters Tang Weibin (0781 5898 1755) and Jie Guoji </F>
(6043 0948 6068)] 
  [Text] Zhengzhou, 22 May (XINHUA) -- Zhu Rongji, vice 
premier and Standing Committee member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, respectively presided over a 
discussion meeting in Wuhan on the economic work in Hubei, 
Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi and in Zhengzhou on the economic work 
in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan from 13 to 22 May. During this 
period, he also inspected the production, purchase, and sale of 
grain and cotton in Hubei and Henan. Zhu Rongji said 
emphatically: To consolidate and develop the current good 
economic situation and to maintain social stability, leading 
comrades at all levels should focus their economic work on 
improving agricultural production and state-owned enterprises. 
At present, this is the key to correctly handling the relations 
between reform, development, and stability. It is necessary to 
conscientiously carry out various agricultural policies put 
forward by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, 
fully arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain and 
cotton, and strive for bumper harvests of both grain and cotton 
to lay a solid material foundation for effectively bringing 
prices under control. It is imperative to make thorough surveys 
of the conditions of enterprises, help them solve their 
problems, further deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises, 
transform their operational mechanism, and make the experiment 
in establishing a modern enterprise system successful. 
  Zhu Rongji carefully heard the briefings on current economic 
work in these provinces. Responsible comrades from relevant 
departments under the State Council gave a brief introduction to 
the current national macroeconomic situation and a plan for 
reforming the system of grain purchase and sale. Leading 
comrades from Hubei and six other provinces, including Jia 
Zhijie, Chen Bangzhu, Fu Xishou, Wu Guanzheng, Ye Liansong, Zhao 
Zhihao, and Li Changchun, as well as responsible comrades from 
relevant economic departments, attended the meeting. 
  Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the achievements made by Hubei and 
other six provinces in deepening the reform, opening wider to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. He said: At present, the national economic situation 
is very good and reforms in various fields are proceeding 
smoothly and are being constantly improved. The new systems 
have gradually become situated on the right track. Practice has 
proved that the series of decisions on strengthening and 
improving macroeconomic control and further deepening the reform 
to restructure the economy made by the CPC Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is fully correct and has 
won support from the broad masses of the people and is highly 
regarded by the world. The party committees and governments at 
all levels have achieved marked results in conscientiously 
carrying out the policies of the central authorities. 
  Zhu Rongji repeatedly stressed the importance of promoting 
agriculture. He pointed out: In the first four months of this 
year, the tendency toward excessive increases in investment in 
fixed assets has been brought under control, the prices of 
capital goods have started to fall again, and the supply of 
industrial consumer goods is plentiful and the prices tend to be 
stable. Therefore, the major tasks in bringing inflation under 
control and maintaining social stability are to further 
implement the spirit of the National Conference on Rural Work 
and to promote the production of grain, cotton, edible oil, and 
vegetables. If we achieve good result in this work, the market 
will become stable and the prices will drop. At present, all 
localities should try in every possible way to complete the 
purchase of the summer crop's grain and oil- bearing farm 
produce. They should strengthen the management of grain and 
oil-bearing farm produce market, maintain normal purchase order, 
and provide enough funds for purchasing grain and oil-bearing 
farm produce. They should insist on the principle of not 
issuing any IOU's. 
  Zhu Rongji said: At present, the tendency of the reform and 
development of state-owned enterprises is good. Calculated in 
terms of comparable items, the profits of the enterprises in the 
first four months of this year did not drop but increased and 
the percentage of enterprises with general debility decreased 
rather than rising. This situation has become a major trend. A 
few state- owned enterprises, mainly small and medium-sized 
ones, are indeed faced with under-capacity operation or even 
shut-downs. Judging from a recent investigation conducted by 
the State Economic and Trade Commission and other relevant 
departments in Beijing and 10 other provinces and 
municipalities, as well as from the current investigation of 
some enterprises in Wuhan and Huangshi, those enterprises which 
are shut down or operate under capacity are indeed faced with 
the problem of not having enough circulation funds. But the 
major problems lie in the fact that some enterprises have 
over-large production capacity and poor management, turn out 
products without a ready market, that the funds used for 
finished products increase, and that the default of payment 
among enterprises has become serious. All these problems cannot 
be solved by relaxing money supply or increasing loans. Leading 
comrades at all levels and responsible persons of enterprises 
should pay more attention to the changes in the market, 
strengthen technological renovation, readjust product mix, 
improve management, and resolutely carry out the principle of 
"limiting production, reducing stockpiles, and promoting sales." 
  Zhu Rongji said emphatically: The fundamental solution to 
the problems faced by the state-owned enterprises lies in 
deepening the enterprise reform, changing the management 
mechanism, and establishing a modern enterprise system which 
meets the requirements of the market economy and in which the 
property rights, as well as the rights and responsibilities of 
enterprises, are clearly defined, government administration and 
enterprise management are separated, and scientific management 
is established. Regarding the shortage of circulation funds for 
enterprises as reflected by all quarters, principal responsible 
persons of economic departments and banks at all levels should 
take the lead in going deep into the grass-roots units to make 
surveys. Banks should render full support to enterprises whose 
products have a ready market, whose product payments are 
retrieval, and whose economic performances are good. Banks also 
should provide loans to those enterprises that begin to 
experience losses so as to help them make up deficits. As to 
those state-owned enterprises which are shut down and have 
problems paying wages to workers, both banks and local 
governments should, in the light of maintaining social 
stability, work together to help them resume production and get 
out of these predicaments. As for those enterprises which have 
recorded losses for a long period and have no hope to make up 
deficits should declare bankruptcy according to the law after 
making good preparations. Such practice should be experimented 
in some areas first and then expanded to others. This will be 
our way to promote the modern enterprise system. 
  During his stay in Hubei, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade 
Jia Zhijie and other responsible comrades of the Hubei 
Provincial CPC Committee and Government, inspected Hanchuan 
county in the central part of the Jianghan Plain. He visited 
peasants who were working or spraying insecticide in the 
farmlands in Hongtang Village and Chenguang Village. He 
conducted a study in Liuge Township on grain's selling price and 
the management of the grain control office. During his stay in 
Henan, Zhu Rongji, accompanied by Comrade Li Changchun and other 
comrades of the Henan Provincial CPC Committee and Government, 
inspected the production and sale of grain and cotton and the 
technique of growing vegetables inside the plastic film sheds. 
He also went to the Hubei provincial branch of the People's 
Bank of China and the Henan provincial branch of the People's 
Bank of China to see cadres and workers there. 
  Responsible comrades of relevant departments under the State 
Council, including Han Shubin, Yao Zhenyan, Wang Chunzheng, Chen 
Qingtai, Liu Zhifeng, Xiang Huaicheng, Wu Yixia, Bai Meiqing, 
Liu Shanzai, Zhu Xiaohua, Ma Yongwei, Wang Xuebing, and Wang 
Zhishan who were on the inspection team, also attended the 
meeting.

(2651 4539): "China's Economic Development: Characteristics of 
1993, Trends in 1994, and Relevant Policies"] 
  [Text] I. Characteristics of China's Economic 
Development in 1993 
  A. Characteristics of the overall position. 
  To judge the characteristics of the overall position of 
China's economic development in 1993, it is necessary to observe 
and study the background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations 
to see what position the year 1993 occupied in this round of 
China's economic fluctuations over the past few years. 
  The year 1990 was the trough of China's previous round of 
economic fluctuations, with a 3.9 percent growth rate in gross 
domestic product (GDP); China's economy began rising again in 
1991, and entered a new round of fluctuations, with an eight 
percent GDP growth rate; she saw high-speed growth in 1992, with 
a 13.2 percent GDP growth rate; and the growth rate for the 
whole of 1993 was 13 percent. Judging by the situation in each 
month of 1993, the growth rate of total industrial output value 
reached a peak of 30.2 percent in June compared with the 
corresponding month of the previous year; beginning in July, the 
temperature [of growth] declined moderately each month, falling 
by an average of 3.45 percentage points each month. 
  Based on the above situation, we can draw the conclusion 
that 
the characteristics of the overall posture of economic 
development in 1993 were: The year 1993 was the peak year of 
the new round of fluctuations in China's economy, and was also a 
turning point in which the economic growth rate began to decline. 
  B. Characteristics of macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  1. Characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 
  Fluctuations in China's economy are closely linked with the 
macroeconomic regulation and control policies taken by the 
government. In 1991 and 1992, until the first half of 1993, the 
characteristics of the direction of macroeconomic regulation and 
control were policies taken to comply with and promote economic 
acceleration and expansion, and, especially after the important 
talks given by Comrade Xiaoping in early 1992 during his 
inspection tour to southern China, the strength of such policies 
was further intensified, thus promoting high-speed economic 
growth. Beginning in June and July 1993, the characteristics of 
the direction of macroeconomic regulation and control changed 
from complying with and stimulating economic expansion to a 
policy of moderate contraction, which caused an excessively high 
rate of economic growth to decline to some extent. 
  The reason why such a change took place in the direction of 
macroeconomic regulation and control was that some problems 
appeared in economic life with high-speed growth which merited 
serious attention, and the outstanding problems were the "four 
highs, four heats, four tensions, and one chaos." The "four 
highs" were high investment expansion, high industrial growth, 
high monetary issue and credit input, and high prices rises; the 
"four heats" were stocks heat, real estate heat, development 
zone heat, and fund-raising heat; the "four tensions" were 
tensions in communications and transportation, tension in 
energy, tension in some important raw and processed materials, 
and tension in funds; and the "one chaos" was a chaotic economic 
order, in particular a chaotic monetary order. To enable 
high-speed economic growth to continue in a healthy and 
sustained manner and to enable the system of a socialist market 
economy to be built up successfully, the central authorities 
introduced in time a number of measures to strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control, thus making economic 
development in the second half of 1993 gradually become normal. 
  2. Characteristics of the means of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. 
  The conspicuous characteristic of the means taken by the 
central authorities in strengthening macroeconomic regulation 
and control was starting by rectifying the monetary order. In 
the past, in the 1950's, 1960's, and 1970's, to fit in with the 
highly centralized system of the planned economy, macroeconomic 
regulation and control mainly relied on financial means; after 
entering the 1980's, to fit in with the transition to a 
socialist market system, more and more monetary means were used 
in macroeconomic regulation and control; in particular, in the 
current macroeconomic regulation and control enacted in the 
second half of 1993, the function of monetary means has already 
risen to a key position. In the past, to fit in with the highly 
centralized system of the planned economy, the department that 
occupied a prominent position in macroeconomic regulation and 
control was the State Planning Commission; now, to fit in with 
the transition to a socialist market economy system, the 
department that occupies a prominent position is the central 
bank. This shows that banking and finance have already entered 
their appropriate core position in China's modern economic life. 
  Such a special function of banking and finance is also fully 
embodied in an important goal that macroeconomic regulation and 
control is trying to achieve--control over the growth of fixed 
assets investments. In the growth of fixed-asset investments, 
in the years of high-speed growth since the 1980's, for example, 
1984, 1985, 1987, and 1992; the rate of increase in state loans 
reached 47 percent, 97 percent, 31 percent, and 66 percent 
respectively, all higher than the margin of self-raised capital 
investment in the corresponding period and far higher than the 
rate of increase of state budgetary investments. Judging by 
absolute amounts, state budgetary investment in 1988, 1989, 1991 
and 1992 declined continuously. Therefore, in the expansion and 
contraction of fixed-asset investments, the role of banking was 
distinctly strengthened, and the role of state finance declined 
remarkably. 
  C. Characteristics of demand push and internal structure of 
industrial production. 
  In the 1980's, the characteristics of China's high-speed 
economic growth in demand push were that the expansion of 
investment demand and the expansion of consumption demand was a 
two-way push. But since 1992, the characteristics of high-speed 
growth have been expressed in a one-way push by the expansion of 
investment demand, and consumption demand has been relatively 
smooth and steady. Regarding the growth rate (calculated at 
constant prices) of overall fixed-asset investments, the peak 
year (1985) in the 1980's was 38.8 percent, it was 42.6 percent 
in 1992, and it was estimated at 46 percent in 1993, which 
turned out to be the year which registered the highest margin of 
increase since the 1980's for overall asset investments. The 
above characteristics were shown in the sectoral structure of 
industrial production, and under the two-way push of investment 
and consumption in the 1980's, light industrial growth was 
faster than heavy industrial growth for several years running 
from 1985 to 1988. In 1990 and 1991, light industry continued 
to grow faster than heavy industry, but under the circumstances 
of a one-way push by investment in 1992 and 1993, heavy industry 
turned to grow faster than light industry. Total heavy 
industrial output value for 1993 was estimated to grow by 25 
percent, and total light industrial output value by 23 percent. 
  Before the 1970's, China emphasized one-sidedly the 
development of heavy industry. From 1953 to 1978, the average 
growth rate of total heavy industrial output value was higher 
than that of total light industrial output value, with the 
former at 13.8 percent and the latter at 9.3 percent. 
Admittedly, such a situation had something to do with the 
building of the initial industrialization system in the early 
days after the founding of the PRC, and also with the need for 
national defense construction, but the delay in the development 
of light industry also seriously held back the development of 
heavy industry and affected the enhancement of living standards. 
In the 1980's, residents' consumption and light industry made 
compensatory development. From 1979 to 1991, the annual average 
growth rate of total light industrial output value (14 percent) 
was higher than that of total heavy industrial output value 
(10.6 percent). In 1992 and 1993, the growth of heavy industry 
was again faster than light industry. We believe that such a 
characteristics will be a long-term trend in the coming one or 
two decades. It has something to do with the development stage 
of China's industrialization. At present, China has entered an 
intermediate stage of industrialization. According to the 
experiences of industrialization in some countries, in the 
intermediate stage of industrialization, it is necessary to take 
heavy industry as the dragon's head to bring up the development 
of the national economy. On the one hand, this is because a 
large amount of growth in investment requires a large amount of 
investment articles provided by heavy industry; on the other 
hand, with the heightening of residents' consumption and changes 
in the consumption structure, heavy industry will also be 
required to provide more consumer goods directly and indirectly. 
Moreover, proceeding from China's national conditions and also 
for the sake of breaking bottleneck restraints in communications 
and transportation, energy, and some important raw and processed 
materials, the high-speed growth of heavy industry is also 
required. Of course, it is not a one-sided development of heavy 
industry, but the coordinated development of light industry and 
heavy industry, and we cannot rule out the possibility that 
light industry will grow faster than heavy industry in 
particular years. 
  D. Characteristics of different types of industrial 
enterprises. 
  After macroeconomic regulation and control in the second 
half 
of 1993 turned tight, different characteristics were expressed 
in different types of industrial enterprises: State-owned 
industrial enterprises again faced a difficult situation, but 
there was a striking contrast with non state-owned industrial 
enterprises, which continued to grow at high speed. 
  Since the 1980's, growth of state-owned industry has 
always lacked strength. The output value growth rate of 
state-owned industrial enterprises has always been in a low 
range of 3 to 13 percent. In 1989 and 1990 in particular, 
state-owned enterprises were faced with the difficult situation 
of production depression, overstocking, declining performance, 
and serious "triangular debts." With the high-speed growth of 
the national economy as a whole in 1992 and the first half of 
1993, the difficult situation of state- owned enterprises was 
relieved slightly. However, after June and July 1993, once 
macroeconomic regulation and control turned tight, the difficult 
situation of state-owned enterprises again revealed itself 
immediately. If we compare the growth rate of China's total 
industrial output value for the same month in the previous year, 
October was down by 2.7 percentage points from September, and 
state-owned industry dropped by 3.2 percentage points. That is 
to say, the decline in the growth of total industrial output 
value was mainly borne by state-owned industry. Calculated by 
cumulative totals from January through October 1993, total 
industrial output value as a whole grew by 23.2 percent over the 
corresponding period of the previous year, while state-owned 
industry only grew by 8.6 percent, collective industry by 40.1 
percent, and "foreign-invested" and other industries by 66.2 
percent. At present, under the circumstances of tight 
macroeconomic regulation and control, rapid market changes, and 
an aggravation of tension in funds, a number of state-owned 
industrial enterprises are basically in a state of production 
suspension or semi-suspension. 
  Since the 1980's, the growth of non state-owned industry has 
always been quite rapid. Output growth of non state-owned 
industry has always been in a high range of 10 to 40 percent. 
The proportion of output of non state-owned industrial 
enterprises in total industrial output value had already risen 
from 22 percent in 1979 (calculated by prices in same year) to 
52 percent in 1992. Therefore, in the growth and fluctuations of 
China's industrial production, state-owned enterprises have been 
replaced by non state-owned enterprises as a source of growth 
and leading fluctuations. Such a situation was shown more 
obviously by the macroeconomic regulation and control of 1993. 
<H5>  II. China's Economic Trends in 1994 and Relevant Policies </H5>
  A. The overall posture of economic development and overall 
policies for macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  1. The overall posture of economic development in 1994. 
  To forecast the overall posture of China's economic 
development in 1994, we must similarly observe and study the 
background of China's macroeconomic fluctuations to see what 
position the year 1994 occupies in this round of China's recent 
economic fluctuations. 
  We believe that in this round of economic fluctuations the 
year 1994 is a year of sustained and high-speed growth after the 
peak. Such a judgement has two meanings: First, compared with 
the peak of 1993, the growth rate in 1994 will decline to some 
extent; second, although the growth rate will decline, it will 
maintain a high level. According to our forecast, the GDP 
growth rate in 1994 will remain at about ten percent. 
  Why will the economic growth rate in 1994 decline to some 
extent? Mainly for the following reasons: First, bottleneck 
restraints. Successive high-speed economic growth in 1992 and 
1993 made it difficult for communications and transportation, 
energy, some important raw and processed materials, and other 
bottleneck sectors to cope. If we force ourselves to do so, it 
will inevitably lead to powerful fluctuations and big ups and 
downs like slamming the brakes on. Second, restraints of price 
rise. Continued high-speed economic growth in 1992 and 1993 has 
already brought about big increases in prices. If the economy 
continues to operate at high speed, it will be difficult for 
society to bear price rises, which could affect social stability 
and the lives of the people. Third, the moderate contraction 
policies that started in June and July 1993 have just made some 
achievements. At present, investment growth and monetary growth 
remain too high and the situation of revenue and expenditure 
balance and foreign trade still must be improved. Therefore, 
such a contraction policy requires persistent implementation to 
fulfill the task of the current readjustment and create 
conditions for a successful transition to next round of new 
growth. Fourth, a moderate decline in the economic growth rate 
in 1994 will loosen the bow-string that has been drawn too tight 
in economic life as a whole, which will be favorable to carrying 
forward various decisions on reform made by the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Congress and to speeding up the pace of 
building the system of a socialist market economy. 
  Why does the economic growth rate in 1994 remain at a high 
level? 
  First, investment will remain large scale. 1) Large numbers 
of projects started in the past two years need to continue, 
which makes the scale of construction large; moreover, some 
important new projects are waiting to start. 2) Earmarking large 
amount of funds to readjust and optimize the industrial 
structure is still required, as is strengthening infrastructure 
construction and basic industries. 3) Residents' savings 
continue to increase by a large amount, and banking and 
financial departments and affiliated organizations have also 
gathered a considerable amount of funds after the rectification, 
which has provided sources of domestic capital for investments. 
4) Investment by foreign businessmen is at a second peak. The 
first peak was from 1985 to 1988. In the growth of overall 
fixed-asset investments, the growth rate of the use of foreign 
investments reached 30 to 48 percent. Beginning from 1992, a 
second peak appeared in investment by foreign businessmen, and 
the growth of the use of foreign investment that year reached 
44.5 percent. At present, the major industrialized countries in 
the world lack strength in economic recovery, and large amounts 
of capital are looking for new investment sites. China's 
social, political, and economic situation are favorable, which 
has created favorable conditions for attracting foreign 
investment. In the current peak of foreign investment, 
investments by foreign businessmen are not just limited to 
coastal areas, but also go right to the interior, and they are 
not just limited to processing industries but also extend to 
infrastructure and basic industries. 
  Second, residents' consumption demand will grow steadily. 
In the past two years, there were new increases in residents' 
income levels, the consumption structure was up-to-grade, and 
the selectivity of commodities purchased further increased, 
which competition fierce in the consumer goods market and 
reinvigorated what was once weak during the trough of economic 
growth a few years ago. The growth of residents' consumption 
will promote the growth of industry and tertiary industry. 
  Third, in the second half of 1993, contradictions between 
supply and demand in communications and transportation, energy, 
and some important raw and processed materials were somewhat 
alleviated. In 1994, judged by the production capacity of these 
bottleneck sectors and the readjustment of imports and exports, 
it will be possible to sustain GDP growth of about 10 percent. 
  Fourth, maintaining a certain growth rate and allowing the 
economic growth rate to decline steadily and avoid large drops 
between years is beneficial to ironing out economic fluctuations 
and preventing large chain reactions and shocks between various 
links of social reproduction caused by excessive slumps. 
  2. Overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and control 
in 1994. 
  The economic trends of 1994 analyzed above depend in actual 
operations to a large extent on the orientation, strength, and 
implementation results of macroeconomic regulation and control 
policies. The overall policies for macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1994 are "soft landing" policies, that is, policies 
of moderate contraction, neither powerful expansion nor overall 
contraction. 
  We must be extremely careful about the strength of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, because if the strength of 
such contraction policies is not well controlled, if the 
strength is too powerful, it will make an already declining 
economy slide by a big margin; however, if the strength is too 
loose, it will not bring a "soft landing" into position, which 
will cause growth to rebound forcefully and lay hidden dangers 
for healthy, sustained, and high-speed economic growth in 1995 
and even in the second half of the 1990's. 
  Proceeding from the above considerations, major economic 
indicators of macroeconomic regulation and control in 1994 will 
be controlled at: 
  1. GDP growth rate will be controlled at about 10 percent; 
  2. The growth rate of total industrial output value will be 
about 16 percent; 
  3. Overall fixed-asset investment will be controlled at 
about 1,360-1,400 billion yuan, about a 20-percent increase over 
1993. With the price factor deducted, actual growth will be 
about 12 percent, slightly higher than the GDP growth rate and 
slightly lower than the growth of industrial production; 
  4. New loans will be controlled at about 550 billion yuan, 
about a 20 percent increase over those of 1993; 
  5. New monetary supply will be about 100 billion yuan, about 
a 17 percent increase over 1993. 
  B. Soft restraints by the system, hard restraints by 
bottlenecks, and policies. 
  Since reform and opening-up, profound changes have taken 
place, compared with the past in some aspects of China's 
economic oscillations, but fundamental changes have not yet 
taken place in other aspects. 
  The changes that have taken place include: 1) In the nature 
of the oscillations, they have changed from classical type as 
the leading factor in the past to growth-type fluctuations as 
the leading factor. So-called classical type fluctuations refer 
to the fact that during periods of economic contraction, major 
economic indicators such as GDP, national income, total 
industrial output value, and other major economic indicators 
decline absolutely, that is negative growth. So-called 
growth-type fluctuation refers to the fact that during periods 
of economic contraction, no declines appear in the absolute 
amounts of major economic indicators, but growth rates slow. 
Such a change in the nature of economic fluctuations shows that 
China's economic development has more powerful strength for 
growth and against depression than in the past. 2) The amplitude 
of the fluctuations has obviously been reduced. This shows that 
steadiness has increased to a certain extent in China's economic 
development and that the government has made greater progress 
than in the past in controlling the direction and strength of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 3) In generating a 
mechanism of industrial fluctuations, the role of state-owned 
enterprises has been reduced and that of non state-owned 
enterprises has been increasingly enhanced. In industrial 
fluctuations, non state-owned industry has already become the 
leading source of fluctuations. 4) In generating mechanisms and 
investment fluctuations, with a multiplicity of investment 
subjects, self-raised fund investments and bank loan investments 
have become the leading waves of investment fluctuations. 5) In 
the transmission of information on fluctuations, price signals 
have started playing their role. 
  However, fundamental changes have not yet taken place in 
the following two important aspects: First, soft restraints by 
the system. If we make a comprehensive survey of China's 
previous economic fluctuations, the source of expansion of the 
investment scale exceeding national strength lay in the original 
planned economy system which lacked a responsibility mechanism 
and restraint mechanism. The problems brought about by 
high-speed economic growth in the first half of 1992 found their 
source in the delay in reforms of the investment, finance, and 
taxation systems and in the delay of reforms in state-owned 
enterprises. That is to say, the "overchaotic" economic order 
caused by systemic factors was the source of the "overheated" 
economy. Therefore, the fundamental way out is to speed up 
reform and quicken the pace of building the socialist market 
economy. The posture of economic development in 1994 is also 
conducive to promoting various reform measures worked out by the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress. In this 
respect, we believe that the emphases of reform in 1994 should 
be: Enterprise reform for the purpose of building a competition 
mechanism, an encouragement mechanism, a restraint mechanism, 
and a risk mechanism and reform of government functions for the 
purpose of building an improved system of taxation, finance, 
investment, planning, and other macroeconomic regulation and 
control systems. The reforms of 1994 are large in operations 
and quick in pace, with extensive aspects involved, and they are 
of a strong nature in storming heavily fortified positions and 
are required to succeed in time to coordinate and complement 
overall work. Whether or not a "soft landing" in 1994 will be 
successful, and whether or not the economy can grow smoothly 
will be an objective examination of whether or not these reforms 
are successful. 
  Second, hard restraints by bottleneck sectors. If we make a 
comprehensive survey of China's previous economic fluctuations, 
beside factors affected by politics, systems, and policies, so 
far as material factors are concerned, most economic expansions 
finally cannot but be postponed because of bottleneck restraints 
either in agriculture, or in communications and transportation, 
energy, and important raw and processed materials. Therefore, 
to readjust the industrial structure by vigorous efforts and 
fundamentally break through the hard restraints of these 
bottleneck sectors are important links in ironing out economic 
fluctuations, improving the overall performance of the national 
economy, and ensuring sustained and smooth economic growth. 
  A moderate decline in the economic growth rate in 1994 will 
temporarily relieve bottleneck restraints. According to 
historical experience, what merits mentioning is that such 
relief should not be misunderstood as the fact that industry has 
been well-restructured and that bottleneck restraints no longer 
exist. There are two types of industrial restructuring: One 
type is adaptive restructuring which only has short-term 
significance, that is, after high-speed economic expansion, less 
demand makes proportional relations achieve a temporary balance 
at a reduced level of demand, but when the next round of 
high-speed expansion appears, such a balance is soon broken 
again. Another kind of industrial restructuring is fundamental 
restructuring of long-term significance, that is, unremittingly 
strengthen construction of bottleneck sectors, fundamentally 
breakthrough bottleneck restraints, and promote the national 
economy as a whole. Judged by historical experience, it is 
often the case that after adaptive restructuring of only 
short-term significance has achieved certain results, 
fundamental restructuring of long-term significance slackens. 
To restructure industry and strengthen the building of the 
bottleneck sectors are issues of strategic importance in 
economic development. 
  3. Trends in commodity prices and policies. 
  To forecast trends in commodity prices in 1994, it is 
necessary to analyze the major causes of prices rises in 1993, 
and then see whether or not these causes will still function in 
1994 and to how large an extent they will still function. 
  There were four major causes of price rises in 1993: 
  1. Long-term and deep-level causes, i.e., price rises 
inevitably brought about by the transition from the original 
planned economy to a market economy. They include: 1) Under 
the original planned economy, cost accounting was incomplete. 
Now, as China is transforming from the original planned economy 
to a market economy and from incomplete cost accounting to 
complete cost accounting, this will inevitably bring about price 
rises. 2) Many service trades in tertiary industry were looked 
upon as welfare undertakings under the planned economy, and 
prices were set very low. In the transition to a market 
economy, prices will inevitably go up. 3) Under the planned 
economy, state finances had to render price subsidies to the 
production and circulation of important commodities that had a 
bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. 
Now, this has changed from covert subsidies to overt subsidies, 
which will inevitably give rise to prices rises. 
  2. The direct impact of the readjustment and release of 
prices. From the second half of 1992 to the first half of 1993, 
the state introduced measures to release and readjust prices for 
a wide range of commodities. This was a stage in which the 
largest steps were taken since price reform. During this 
period, the readjustment and release of prices was mainly 
concentrated on grain, energy, raw and processed materials, 
communications and transportation, and on prices in other 
tertiary industries. According to an estimate by specialists in 
a state department in charge of prices, the state's readjustment 
and release of prices in a planned way after the second half of 
1992, plus increases in retail sales business tax, had an impact 
of 60 percent on overall price level. 
  3. Demand push by investment expansion and excessive 
monetary issuance. The years 1992 and 1993 had the highest 
growth rates of overall fixed assets investments since the 
1980's. Powerful expansion of investment demand led to big 
increase in prices of building materials and the means of 
production, which built up cost pushes for processing industry. 
Moreover, expansion of the investment scale, high-speed growth 
in the economy as a whole, and increasing financial deficits 
during these two years compelled banks to issue money to excess. 
In 1992, money in circulation grew by 36.4 percent, in the 
first half of 1993 it grew by 54.1 percent, and 30 percent 
growth was estimated for the whole year. Excessive growth of 
money in circulation inevitably led to price rises. 
  4. The impact of a chaotic economic order, in particular a 
chaotic monetary order on price rises. In the second half of 
1992 and the first half of 1993, there was the phenomenon of 
illegal bank lending of a large amount of funds that had not 
appeared in over 40 years; some local banks directly 
participated in stocks and bonds businesses and real estate 
investments. In the "funds-raising heat," many fundraisers 
competed with each other to raise dividends and bonuses. Under 
the signboard of developing tertiary industry, some government 
departments indiscriminately collected fees, increased prices, 
and apportioned expenses. Chaos in economic order led to 
"bubble"-type hotspots and helped increase prices of the means 
of production, real estate, stocks, funds, services, and swap 
foreign exchange prices. 
  In 1994, the fourth kind of cause mentioned above, i.e., the 
impact of a chaotic economic order on price rises, is being 
overcome. The first and the second causes, that is, various 
kinds of cost push brought about by the readjustment and release 
of prices during the transition to a market economy, are still 
playing a great role in raising prices objectively. The 
remaining third cause, demand push by investment expansion and 
excessive monetary issue, will become the crucial link. This 
will depend on the results of macroeconomic regulation and 
control in 1994. In macroeconomic regulation and control in 
1994, if investment expansion and excessive monetary issuance 
can be appropriately inhibited to make the economic growth rate 
drop to some extent, then it will be possible to reduce the 
margin of price rises. However, if the investment growth rate, 
the money growth rate, and the growth rate of the economy as a 
whole rebound too soon and too drastically, then price increases 
will also go up further on the basis of the first and second 
causes. 
  In corresponding policies, besides continuing to carry out 
the important policies of moderate contraction policies in 
macroeconomic regulation and control, problems to which 
attention should be paid and policies should be taken are: 1) In 
all possible factors that affect prices rise, an impact which 
cannot be neglected is the residents' psychology. It is 
necessary to pay attention to and correctly explain the causes 
of price rises and correctly analyze the price situation, and do 
not arouse residents' psychological expectation of price rise, 
far less stir up panic purchasing. 2) The situation of 
agricultural production has a direct bearing on the stability of 
prices. On the basis of intensifying rural reform, promoting 
agricultural development, and increasing peasants' incomes, 
further mobilize the production initiative of the peasants, and 
try to reap a good harvest in agriculture in 1994. 3) In 1994, 
affected by the lag effect of various cost pushes during the 
previous period, the decline in the margin of price rises of 
consumer goods and services may possibly be smaller than the 
decline in the margin of price increase for investment goods. 
Moreover, in the "rise amidst stability" in prices of consumer 
goods in recent years, there were very rapid increases and 
strong rigidity in prices of basic daily necessities and 
services which were relatively small in income elasticity and 
price elasticity. Therefore, for prices of consumer goods, in 
particular for those basic daily necessities and services, it is 
also necessary to give play to the role of guiding and mandatory 
regulation and control by the state while the functions of 
market regulation are brought into full play. Strengthen the 
management of market prices and avoid artificial prices rises. 
4) In enterprise reform, encourage competition, improve 
performance, and strengthen enterprises' capacity to digest 
cost-push factors. 
  Taken as a whole, through the various efforts being made, we 
can expect to keep the overall price level at about 8 percent in 
1994 and create favorable conditions for a further decline in 
the margin of price rises in 1995 and the years to come.

<F P=106> ["Arbitration Rules of the China International Economic and </F>
Trade Arbitration Commission"] 
  [Text] The rules were amended and passed by the first 
session of the second standing committee of the China Council 
for the Promotion of International Trade (China Chamber of 
International Commerce) 17 March 1944. 
<H5>  Chapter I -- General Rules </H5>
  Section One: Authority 
  Article 1. These arbitration rules were formulated in 
accordance with the relevant provisions in the PRC laws, the 
"Decisions" of the Administration Council of the central 
people's government, and the "Circular" and the "Official Reply" 
of the State Council. 
  Article 2. The China International Economic and Trade 
Arbitration Commission (first called the China Council for the 
Promotion of International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration 
Commission, later called the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade-Foreign Economic and Trade Arbitration 
Commission, now called the China International Economic and 
Trade Arbitration Commission; hereafter referred to as the 
Arbitration Commission, for short) independently and impartially 
solves, through arbitration, the disputes arising from 
international or foreign-related contractual or non-contractual 
economic matters and trade, including those between foreign 
legal entities and/or natural persons, on the one hand, and 
Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons on the other; 
between foreign legal entities and/or natural persons; and 
between Chinese legal entities and/or natural persons; so as to 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of those involved 
and to promote the development of domestic and foreign economic 
activities and trade. 
  Article 3. The Arbitration Commission handles cases in 
accordance with either the arbitration agreement reached by the 
parties involved -- before or after the dispute occurs -- that 
their disputes are to be submitted to the Arbitration Commission 
for arbitration, or with a written application presented by one 
of the parties involved. 
  The arbitration agreement refers to the arbitration clauses 
specified in the contract made by the parties involved, or to 
the written agreement reached in a certain way that any disputes 
are to be presented to the Arbitration Commission for 
arbitration. 
  Article 4. The Arbitration Commission is entitled to make 
decisions about the existence and validity of arbitration 
agreements and the authority [guan xia quan 4619 6561 2938] of 
arbitration cases. 
  Article 5. The arbitration clauses in a contract should be 
regarded as independent of other clauses in the contract, and 
the arbitration agreement attached to the contract also should 
be taken as a part that is independent of other clauses in the 
contract. When the contract is changed, dissolved, annulled, or 
ceases to be effective or becomes invalid, the effectiveness of 
the arbitration clauses or arbitration agreements will not be 
affected. 
  Article 6. The authority over the arbitration agreement 
and/or the arbitration cases is not to be challenged after the 
accused gives the first substantial reply. The argument against 
the authority over the countercharge is not to be advanced after 
the party to whom the countercharge is addressed gives the first 
substantial reply to the countercharge. 
  Article 7. If the parties concerned agree to submit their 
disputes to the arbitration committee for arbitration, they are 
regarded as agreeing to settle their disputes in accordance with 
these arbitration rules. 
  Section Two: Organization 
  Article 8. The Arbitration Commission is to appoint an 
honorary chairman and several advisers. 
  Article 9. The Arbitration Commission consists of one 
chairman, a number of vice chairmen, one secretary general, and 
a number of other members. The chairman performs the duties 
specified in these rules, while the vice chairmen performs the 
chairman's duties at the latter's request. 
  The Arbitration Commission is to set up a secretarial bureau 
to handle day-to-day work. 
  Article 10. The Arbitration Commission is to draw up a 
namelist of arbitrators. The China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade (the China Chamber of International 
Commerce) is to appoint as arbitrators Chinese and foreigners 
who have special knowledge about and practical experience in 
law, economics, trade, and science and technology. 
  Article 11. The Arbitration Commission is to be set up in 
Beijing. The Arbitration Commission is to set up branches in 
both Shenzhen and Shanghai. The Arbitration Commission and its 
branches are an inseparable whole. 
  The branch is to set up a secretariat to handle the branch's 
routine work. 
  These rules apply to the Arbitration Commission and its 
branches, without exception. In settling disputes by 
arbitration, the chairman and secretariat of the branch perform 
the duties of the chairman and the secretarial bureau of the 
Arbitration Commission, as stipulated in the rules. 
  Article 12. The two parties involved, by agreement, may 
submit their disputes for arbitration in Beijing, Shenzhen, or 
Shanghai. If they do not make an agreement about this, it is up 
to the declarant to make a choice, and the first choice prevails 
if there is more than one. The Arbitration Commission is to 
make a decision about the dispute, if any, arising therefrom. 
  Chapter Two -- Arbitration Procedure 
  Section One: Application for Arbitration, Reply, and 
Countercharge 
  Article 13. The arbitration procedure begins the day the 
accused receives an arbitration notice from the Arbitration 
Commission; if the accused party is composed of more than one 
person, the procedure begins the day the last person accused 
receives his notice. 
  Article 14. When applying for arbitration, the declarant 
must: 
  1. Submit an application, in which he must supply: 
  a. The names and addresses of the declarant and the accused 
(ZIP codes, telephone numbers, telex and fax numbers, and cable 
addresses, if any); 
  b. The arbitration agreement supporting the application; 
  c. The details of the case and the main points at issue; 
  d. Requests for instructions, and the facts and the evidence 
in support of the requests. 
  The application for arbitration must be signed and/or sealed 
by the declarant and/or his authorized agent. 
  2. When submitting an application for arbitration, the 
declarant must attach to the application the certificate of the 
facts supporting his request for instruction. 
  3. Choose -- or ask the chairman of the Arbitration 
Commission to choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of 
arbitrators to arbitrate the dispute. 
  4. The arbitration fee must be paid in advance according to 
the tariff set by the Arbitration Commission. 
  Article 15. The Arbitration Commission may ask the declarant 
to supply more materials if, after examining the submitted 
application and its annex, it considers the declarant has not 
gone through the necessary procedures; if it considers the 
declarant has gone through the necessary procedures, it must 
immediately serve the accused with an arbitration notice, 
together with a copy of the declarant's application and its 
annex, the arbitration rules of the Arbitration Commission, the 
namelist of arbitrators, and the table of arbitration charges. 
  Article 16. Within 20 days of the date of receipt of the 
arbitration notice, the accused must choose -- or ask the 
chairman of the Arbitration Committee to choose -- an arbitrator 
from the namelist of arbitrators to arbitrate the dispute. 
  Article 17. Within 45 days of the date of receipt of the 
arbitration notice, the accused must submit his reply to the 
charge, in writing, to the Arbitration Commission's secretarial 
bureau, along with relevant certificates. 
  Article 18. The accused must submit his written 
countercharge, if any, to the Arbitration Commission's 
secretarial bureau within 60 days of the date of receipt of the 
arbitration notice. 
  Article 19. The declarant may amend his request for making 
complaints and the accused may amend his request for making 
countercomplaints, but the arbitration tribunal is to reject the 
amendment if it considers the amendment came too late and thus 
would affect the arbitration procedure. 
  Article 20. When submitting to the Arbitration Committee an 
application for arbitration, a written reply, or a written 
countercharge -- together with the relevant certificates and 
documents -- the party involved must send a copy of the above to 
his counterpart(s) and to every member of the arbitration 
tribunal. 
  Article 21. The arbitration procedure will proceed as 
necessary in the absence of the written reply made by the 
accused or the written reply made by the declarant to the 
countercharge made by the accused. 
  Article 22. The party involved may authorize an agent to 
handle matters relating to the arbitration, and the agent must 
submit his letter of authority to the Arbitration Commission. 
  Either Chinese or foreign citizens may act as agents. 
  Article 23. If a party involved applies for action to keep 
the property involved intact, the Arbitration Commission is to 
pass the application on to the intermediate people's court in 
the counterpart's place of residence or in the place where the 
property is located. 
  Section Two: Composition of the Arbitration Tribunal 
  Article 24. When either party involved has chosen -- or has 
asked the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to choose -- an 
arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators, the Arbitration 
Commission must immediately choose a third arbitrator as the 
chief arbitrator so that the three will form an arbitration 
tribunal to hear the case. 
  Article 25. The two parties involved may jointly choose -- 
or jointly ask the chairman of the Arbitration Commission to 
choose -- an arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators as a 
single arbitrator, who is to set up an arbitration tribunal to 
hear the case on his own. 
  If the two parties involved have intended that their case be 
heard by a single arbitrator, but fail to reach agreement on the 
choice of the arbitrator within 20 days of the date of receipt 
of the arbitration notice by the accused, the Arbitration 
Commission is to appoint one. 
  Article 26. If the accused fails to appoint -- or fails to 
ask the chairman of the Arbitration Committee to appoint -- an 
arbitrator, as required by Article 16 of these arbitration 
rules, the chairman of the Arbitration Commission is to appoint 
one for him. 
  Article 27. If there are two or more declarants and/or two 
or more defendants, the two parties must, after consultation, 
separately choose an arbitrator from the namelist of 
arbitrators. If the declarants fail to jointly appoint an 
arbitrator when they submit the arbitration application and/or 
the defendants fail to jointly appoint an arbitrator within 20 
days of the date of receipt of the arbitration notice by the 
last defendant, the Arbitration Committee is to appoint one 
arbitrator for either of them. 
  Article 28. If the appointed arbitrator has been involved in 
the case, he must inform the Arbitration Commission of that and 
ask for permission to stand clear of the case. 
  Article 29. If the party involved has any reasonable 
doubt concerning the fairness and independence of the appointed 
arbitrator, he is to give the Arbitration Committee a written 
request for the arbitrator to stand clear of the case, stating 
the specific facts and reasons supporting the request. 
  The written request is to be advanced 15 days before the 
first hearing of the case; if the reason for the arbitrator to 
stand clear of the case is available only after the first 
hearing is held, the request is to be advanced before the last 
session of the first hearing closes. 
  Article 30. Whether the arbitrator should stand clear of the 
case is decided by the Arbitration Commission. 
  Article 31. If an appointed arbitrator stands clear of the 
case or fails to discharge his duties for other reasons, a new 
arbitrator must be appointed according to the procedures by 
which the defunct arbitrator is appointed. 
  When a new arbitrator is appointed, the arbitration tribunal 
must decide whether the previously held hearing must be repeated 
in part or in full. 
  Section Three: Hearing 
  Article 32. The arbitration tribunal should try cases in 
court, but on the application of the two parties involved -- or 
their agreement -- and on condition that the arbitration 
tribunal also considers it unnecessary to try the case in court, 
the arbitration tribunal is to try the case and give a verdict 
on the basis of written documents. 
  Article 33. When the arbitration tribunal has assigned the 
date for the first hearing, after having consulted with the 
Arbitration Commission secretarial bureau, the secretarial 
bureau must give notice to the two parties involved 30 days 
before the hearing is held. The parties involved may seek a 
postponement of the hearing, but must submit a written request 
to the secretarial bureau 30 days before the hearing, stating 
the reason. Whether the hearing will be put off is decided by 
the arbitration tribunal. 
  Article 34. The notices of the dates for subsequent court 
sessions following the first hearing are not subject to 30-day 
time limit. 
  Article 35. The cases accepted by the Arbitration Commission 
are to be heard in Beijing; they may be heard in other 
localities with approval of the chairman of the Arbitration 
Commission. The cases accepted by the branches of the 
Arbitration Commission are to be heard locally; they may be 
heard in other localities with approval of branch chairmen. 
  Article 36. The arbitration tribunal is not to hold an open 
hearing of cases; if the two parties involved ask for a public 
hearing, the arbitration tribunal is to make a decision 
concerning the request. 
  Article 37. If a case is not heard openly, the two parties 
involved and their agents -- as well as the witnesses, 
arbitrators, experts whose expertise is called upon by the 
arbitration tribunal, appointed appraisers, and members of the 
Arbitration Commission and its secretarial bureau -- are not 
allowed to divulge the actual situation and relevant procedures. 
  Article 38. The parties involved are to provide evidence 
supporting their complaints, replies, and countercharges. The 
arbitration tribunal is to conduct investigations to collect 
evidence on its own, as necessary. 
  When conducting investigations to collect evidence on its 
own, the arbitration tribunal is to ask the two parties involved 
to turn up in time if it considers their presence necessary. 
The investigations are not affected by the absence of either or 
both of the parties involved. 
  Article 39. The arbitration tribunal is to call on the 
expertise of experts on special issues in the case or to assign 
a appraiser to give an appraisal. Either Chinese or foreign 
organizations or citizens may act as experts or appraisers. 
  The arbitration tribunal is entitled to ask the parties 
involved to provide relevant materials, documents, assets, or 
goods to experts/appraisers for inspection and/or assessment, 
and the parties involved are duty-bound to act as requested. 
  Article 40. Copies of reports by experts and/or appraisers 
must be sent to the two parties involved, and the two parties 
involved must be given opportunities to express their opinions 
on the reports. If any party involved asks the expert/appraiser 
to attend the court session, the latter may do so with approval 
of the arbitration tribunal and give a explanation on the report 
if the arbitration tribunal considers it necessary and 
appropriate. 
  Article 41. The evidence provided by the parties involved is 
examined and approved by the arbitration tribunal; whether the 
reports made by experts and/or appraisers is acceptable will be 
decided by the arbitration tribunal. 
  Article 42. When either party involved fails to attend the 
court session, the arbitration tribunal is to conduct the trial 
and give judgment by default. 
  Article 43. The secretarial bureau is allowed to take notes 
on and/or record the court session. The arbitration tribunal is 
to make a statement of the key points of the court session, and 
ask the parties involved and/or their agents, witnesses, and/or 
other relevant personnel to sign the statement, when necessary. 
  The notes and/or recording made by the secretarial bureau 
are 
for the arbitration tribunal's reference only. 
  Article 44. If the two parties involved effect a 
reconciliation out of court, they are to ask the arbitration 
tribunal to give a verdict on the basis of the contents of the 
reconciliation agreement and then close the case; they also are 
to apply to withdraw the case. The chairman of the Arbitration 
Committee is to make a decision on the case if the two parties 
involved apply to withdraw the case before the arbitration 
tribunal is set up; the arbitration tribunal makes a decision on 
the case if the two parties involved apply to withdraw the case 
after the arbitration tribunal is set up. 
  If a party involved applies for arbitration after the case 
has been withdrawn, it is up to the chairman of the Arbitration 
Committee to make a decision whether or not the case will be 
heard. 
  Article 45. If a party involved knows -- or is supposed 
to know -- that any articles laid down in these arbitration 
rules or in the arbitration agreement are not being observed, 
but still participates in the arbitration or continues with the 
arbitration rather than raising a timely and clear objection, he 
is regarded as waiving his right to raise an objection. 
  Article 46. If both parties involved desire to make peace, 
or only one party desires to do so and succeeds in securing an 
agreement with the other party through the arbitration tribunal, 
the arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the dispute on trial 
when the arbitration procedure is in progress. 
  Article 47. The arbitration tribunal is to mediate in the 
way it considers appropriate. 
  Article 48. If one party involved proposes to suspend 
mediation, or if the arbitration tribunal considers that its 
mediation will not go anywhere, the arbitration tribunal is to 
suspend the mediation and continue to settle the dispute by 
arbitration. 
  Article 49. If the two parties involved reach a compromise 
out of the arbitration court while the court is mediating in the 
dispute, the compromise should be regarded as having been 
reached through the mediation by the arbitration tribunal. 
  Article 50. If the two parties reach a compromise through 
the mediation of the arbitration tribunal, the two parties must 
sign a written compromise agreement; unless the two parties make 
a separate agreement, the arbitration tribunal is to close the 
case by giving a verdict in light of the compromise agreement. 
  Article 51. If the mediation proves unsuccessful, then in 
support of his complaint, reply, and/or countercharge neither 
party involved is -- in the arbitration procedure, or the 
judicial or any other procedures thereafter -- to quote any 
opinion, viewpoint, suggestion, or fact the other party or the 
arbitration tribunal has expressed, advanced, proposed, 
admitted, shown willingness to accept, or rejected in the course 
of the mediation process. 
  Section Four: Handing Down a Ruling 
  Article 52. The arbitration tribunal must give a written 
ruling within nine months of the date of its formation. On the 
demand of the arbitration tribunal, the Arbitration Committee is 
to extend the time limit if it considers this necessary and 
reasonable. 
  Article 53. The arbitration tribunal must give an impartial 
verdict on its own, according to the facts, the law, the 
contract, and international practice, and in line with fair and 
reasonable principles. 
  Article 54. The arbitration tribunal must give the reasons 
for its verdict, except for a verdict given according to the 
content of the compromise agreement reached by the two parties 
involved. All or most members of the arbitration tribunal must 
sign the written verdict and the Arbitration Committee must 
affix its seal to it. The date and place of the verdict's 
delivery must be given. 
  The date when the verdict is given is the date when the 
verdict comes into effect. 
  Article 55. The majority of the three-member arbitration 
tribunal is to decide on the verdict, but the minority opinion 
may be noted down and attached to the verdict. The arbitrator 
who holds a dissenting opinion may or may not sign the verdict. 
  Article 56. If the arbitration tribunal fails to reach a 
majority decision, the verdict is to be based on the chief 
arbitrator's opinion. 
  Article 57. The arbitration tribunal is to give an 
intermediate or partial ruling on any issue in the case if it 
considers this necessary or if the parties involved -- with 
approval of the arbitration tribunal -- propose to do so. Any 
relevant party's failure to accept the ruling is not to affect 
the arbitration procedure or the final verdict given by the 
arbitration tribunal. 
  Article 58. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide 
on arbitration charges and other expenses the two parties 
involved must pay to the Arbitration Committee. 
  Article 59. The arbitration tribunal is entitled to decide 
on the amount the losing party should pay to the prevailing 
party to cover a part of reasonable expenses the prevailing 
party incurs in filing the case, but the damages must not be 
more than 10 percent of the amount recovered by the prevailing 
party. 
  Article 60. The ruling given by the arbitration tribunal is 
final, and is binding on the two parties involved. No party is 
allowed to sue in court or to ask any organization to change the 
ruling. 
  Article 61. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the 
written verdict, any of the parties involved may send a written 
application to the arbitration tribunal asking it to correct 
errors in writing, printing, calculation, and other errors of 
similar nature in the written verdict. If there really are any 
errors, the arbitration tribunal must make written corrections 
within 30 days of the date of receipt of the written 
application. The arbitration tribunal also is allowed to make 
written corrections itself within 30 days of the date of issue 
of the written verdict. The correction in writing is an 
inseparable part of the verdict. 
  Article 62. Within 30 days of the date of receipt of the 
written judgment, if the arbitration tribunal is found to have 
left some issues unjudged in its written judgment, any of the 
parties involved is entitled to send a written application to 
the arbitration tribunal asking it to give rulings on such 
unjudged issues. 
  If certain issues really are left unjudged, the arbitration 
tribunal must deliver rulings on the unjudged issues within 30 
days of the date of receipt of the written application. The 
arbitration tribunal is also allowed to give rulings on such 
unjudged issues of its own accord within 30 days of the date of 
issue of the written judgment. The additional judgment is an 
inseparable part of the original judgment. 
  Article 63. The party involved must fulfill the verdict of 
his own accord within the time limit set by the written 
judgment; if a time limit is not set in the written judgment, 
the verdict must be fulfilled immediately. 
  If a party refuses to fulfill the verdict, the other 
party is allowed to apply to the Chinese court for fulfillment 
of the verdict in accordance with Chinese law, or he may apply 
to a relevant foreign court, which carries authority, for 
fulfillment of the verdict in accordance with the 1958 
"Convention on Acknowledging and Implementing Arbitration 
Verdicts Given by Foreign Countries" or with other international 
conventions to which China is a signatory state or to which 
China has acceded. 
  Chapter Three -- Simple Procedures 
  Article 64. Unless the two parties involved have a separate 
agreement, the simple procedures apply to a case involving a sum 
less than 500,000 yuan, or a case involving a sum over 500,000 
yuan on condition that a party has sent in a written application 
for arbitration and has secured the another party's written 
approval for the application. 
  Article 65. If a party involved has applied to the 
Arbitration Committee for arbitration and the Arbitration 
Committee -- after examination -- has agreed to handle the case, 
the chairman of the Arbitration Committee must immediately 
choose a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of 
the Arbitration Committee to set up an arbitration tribunal to 
hear the case, unless the two parties involved have jointly 
chosen a single arbitrator from the namelist of arbitrators of 
the Arbitration Committee. The Arbitration Committee 
secretarial bureau must immediately serve an arbitration notice 
to the other party. 
  Article 66. A party involved must supply the Arbitration 
Committee secretarial bureau with his reply and relevant 
certificates within 30 days of the date of receipt of the 
arbitration notice; if he has any countercharge, he must supply 
the written countercharge and relevant certificates within the 
same time period. 
  Article 67. The arbitration tribunal is to hear the case in 
a way it considers appropriate. It may hear the case in written 
form [shu mian shen li 2579 7240 1399 3810] on the basis of the 
written materials and documentary evidence submitted by the 
parties involved, or may hear the case in court. 
  Article 68. The parties involved must submit written 
materials and written evidence necessary for arbitration as 
required by the arbitration tribunal and within the time limit. 
  Article 69. When a date has been appointed for hearing a 
case in court, the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau must 
notify the two parties involved of the date 10 days before. 
  Article 70. If the arbitration tribunal decides to hear the 
case in court, it is to do so only once, and not twice, unless 
necessary. 
  Article 71. In the process of following the simple 
procedure, the procedure -- as well as the arbitration 
tribunal's power to deliver a verdict -- will not be affected by 
the failure of any party involved to act according to the simple 
procedure. 
  Article 72. The procedure will not be affected by a change 
in the application for arbitration or by the presentation of a 
countercharge, unless this contradicts Article 64. 
  Article 73. The arbitration tribunal must pass a written 
judgment within 30 days of the date it begins hearing a case; if 
the case is heard in a written form, the arbitration tribunal 
must give a written verdict within 90 days of the date it is set 
up. If necessary, the Arbitration Committee is to extend these 
time limits. 
  Article 74. Relevant provisions in other chapters of these 
rules apply to matters not covered in this chapter. 
  Chapter Four -- Supplementary Articles 
  Article 75. The Arbitration Committee uses Chinese as its 
formal language. If the parties involved have a separate 
agreement on the language to be used, the agreement will prevail. 
  If any party involved -- or his agent or witness -- needs an 
interpreter when the arbitration tribunal is hearing a case in 
court, the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau will provide 
one; the party involved also is to provide an interpreter 
himself. 
  The Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau is to ask the 
parties involved to supply Chinese versions or versions in other 
languages of various written materials or documentary evidence 
submitted, if it considers this necessary. 
  Article 76. Unless the parties involved have a separate 
agreement or the arbitration tribunal has made a separate 
decision, all documents, notices, and other materials are to be 
sent to the parties involved and/or their agents by hand, 
registered mail, express delivery, fax, telex, telegraph, or in 
other means the Arbitration Committee secretarial bureau 
considers appropriate. 
  Article 77. If any written correspondence has been delivered 
to the recipient in person; or has been sent to the recipient's 
business address, regular dwelling place, or communication 
address; or has been sent -- when any of the above three 
addresses is unavailable, despite reasonable inquiry -- to the 
recipient's latest known business address, regular dwelling 
place, or communication address by registered mail or other 
means by which it can be proved that the written correspondence 
was sent, the written correspondence is regarded as having been 
sent. 
  Article 78. Apart from collecting arbitration charges from 
the parties involved according to the tariff set by the 
Arbitration Committee, the Arbitration Committee is to collect 
from them any additional and reasonable charges, including the 
special rewards and travel and boarding expenses for the 
arbitrators, as well as expenses for engaging experts, 
appraisers, and interpreters by the arbitration tribunal. 
  The Arbitration Committee is to charge the two parties 
involved a fee if they apply to withdraw the case after reaching 
a compromise on their own; the amount of the fee will be 
determined by the workload involved and the money actually spent. 
  Article 79. If the arbitration provisions in the arbitration 
agreement or in the contract make it clear that any disputes are 
to be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee or its branches or 
its predecessors -- the China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade-Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission or the 
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade-Foreign 
Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission -- the two parties 
involved are regarded as having unanimously agreed that their 
disputes be arbitrated by the Arbitration Committee and its 
branches. 
  Article 80. These rules come into effect 1 June 1994. The 
arbitration rules which came into force 1 January 1989 apply to 
cases handled by the Arbitration Committee and its branches 
before 1 June 1994. These rules will apply to the above cases, 
subject to approval of the two parties involved. 
  Article 81. The power of interpretation of these rules is 
vested in the Arbitration Committee.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Qingfang (2612 1987 5364) of the Chinese Academy of </F>
Social Sciences Sociology Research Institute : "Which Provinces 
and Municipalities Are Developing Faster in the Wake of Reform 
and Opening Up?"] 
  [Text] In the 14 years since reform and opening up 
(1979-1992), China has registered rapid growth in its economic 
and social development. To make a comprehensive assessment of 
the overall achievements made since reform and opening up and 
draw a comparison between provinces and municipalities, the 
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Sociology Research Institute 
"Social Indicator" Topic Group selected 20 representative major 
indicators from the 1993 China Statistics Almanac and 
information provided by relevant departments, used composite 
index numbers to make vertical and horizontal comparisons, and 
assessed and arranged sequentially the social development growth 
of the provinces and municipalities. 
<H5>  I. Coastal Areas Register Swiftest Growth, With Zhejiang, </H5>
Guangdong, Hainan, Jiangsu, and Shanghai Taking the Lead 
  Regarding the composite growth indices for the 20 indicators 
in economic and social development since reform, Zhejiang ranked 
first, registering an increase in 1992 of 180 percent over 1978, 
an average annual growth of 7.6 percent; Guangdong ranked 
second, an annual rise of 7.5 percent; Hainan and Jiangsu, were 
both up 7.4 percent annually; and Shanghai was up 7 percent. 
The provinces ranking 6th to 10th were: Yunnan and Shandong, 
up 6.9 percent; and Fujian, Xinjiang, and Henan, up 6.3 percent. 
Those ranking 11th to 20th, with an annual progressive growth 
of 6.1 percent to 5.2 percent were: Hebei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, 
Guangxi, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, and Shanxi. 
Those ranking 21st to 30th, with an annual growth of 5.1 
percent to 4 percent were: Liaoning, Beijing, Ningxia, Tianjin, 
Jilin, Tibet, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Shaanxi, and Qinghai. 
  1. Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Zhejiang have the 
fastest growth in the economic efficiency index. 
  The economic efficiency index, which comprises the six 
indicators of per capita GDP, social labor productivity 
(calculated according to comparable prices), original value of 
the state's industrial fixed assets, capital profit and tax rate 
of industrial enterprises, per capita local revenue, and grain 
produced by every agricultural laborer, is the key to social 
development and a better quality of life. It reflects the 
comprehensive increase in economic efficiency of industrial and 
agricultural production. As regards the national composite 
index, the average annual growth was 6.2 percent in the 14 
years. The quickest growth of 9 to 10 percent was registered in 
Hainan, Guangdong, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. A relatively fast 
growth of 7.6 to 7.9 percent was recorded in Fujian, Guizhou, 
Jiangsu, Xinjiang, and Shandong. The per capita GDP is an 
essential composite indicator reflecting economic and social 
development. The growth in Zhejiang was the fastest in 14 
years, with an annual increase of 11.6 percent while Guangdong 
registered an 11.5 percent rise. A relatively fast growth of 8 
to 9.9 percent was recorded in Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, 
Xinjiang, Hainan, Henan, and Sichuan. The social labor 
productivity (average national income) is an important indicator 
reflecting overall economic efficiency. Zhejiang ranked first, 
with a 10.6 percent rise while Guangdong rose by 10.2 percent. 
The growth was between 8.2 to 9.6 percent in Jiangsu, Fujian, 
Xinjiang, and Shandong. The capital profit and tax rate of 
industrial enterprises is an important indicator reflecting 
industrial economic efficiency. Compared with 1978, the 
country's rate in 1992 had dropped 59 percent. With the 
exception of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Tibet which registered 
increases, the rate in the other 27 regions dropped. 
  2. The index of social set-up increased fastest in 
Hainan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan. 
  The social set-up, which comprises the four indicators of 
the 
ratio of laborers in the tertiary industry, the ratio of 
nonagricultural laborers, the ratio of nonagricultural 
population, and the ratio of social investment, reflects the 
extent of urbanization and social development. The nation's 
average growth has increased 4.5 percent annually over the past 
14 years, with Hainan, Hebei, Shandong, Hubei, and Hunan 
registering the highest rate of 8.2 down to 6.5 percent. In the 
ratio of laborers of the tertiary industry, the country's 
average rose from 12.1 percent in 1978 to 19.6 percent in 1992, 
a rise of 62 percent or an annual rise of 3.5 percent. A fast 
rate of 6.2 percent down to 5.1 percent was recorded in Hubei, 
Guangdong, Fujian, Tibet, Qinghai, Zhejiang, Shandong, and 
Anhui. Viewed from the proportion of the laborers in the 
tertiary industry, the highest rate of 45.6 percent down to 27.2 
percent was recorded in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and 
Guangdong. The proportion of nonagricultural population 
developed at a relatively slow pace, with the country's average 
rising from 15.8 percent in 1978 to 21.7 percent in 1992, a rise 
of 37.2 percent. Shandong achieved the quickest rate, rising 
from 8.8 to 20.5 percent, up 133 percent or an annual increase 
of 6.2 percent. A relatively quick annual rate of 4.1 down to 
3.2 percent was also registered in Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, and 
Guangdong. 
  3. The population quality index rose fastest in 
Shanghai, Shandong, and Xinjiang. 
  Comprised of the natural growth rate, the proportion of 
people with junior high school education in the total 
population, and the number of university and college graduates 
per 10,000 workers, the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers, and the number of doctors per 10,000 people, the index 
reflects the ability to control population growth and the 
quality of culture, technology, and health. As the improvement 
in population quality requires a relatively high input and 
training people takes a long time, its growth is slower than 
other systems. The national average rose at an annual rate of 
4.1 percent, with Shanghai, Shandong, and Xinjiang in the 
forefront, at 8.8, 5.7, and 5.4 percent respectively. The 
nation's natural growth rate decreased from 12 per mill in 1978 
to 11.6 per mill in 1992. Shanghai did a good job in population 
control and dropped its natural growth rate from 5.1 per mill in 
1978 to 0.5 per mill. Shandong ranked second, with its rate 
dropping from 10.5 to 4.6 per mill. The rate in Beijing dropped 
from 6.8 to 3.1 per mill. If calculated backwards with the 
negative index, the annual average increases for the province 
and two municipalities are 17.3, 6.2, and 5.7 percent 
respectively. As regards the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers, the nation's average increased from 612 in 1978 to 
1,616 in 1992, up 164 percent or an annual rise of 7.2 percent. 
The rate was relatively fast in Xinjiang, Fujian, Guangdong, 
Yunnan, and Zhejiang, registering annual increases of 9.2 down 
to 8.6 percent. However, the number of technicians per 10,000 
workers in Xinjiang and Guangdong is around 1,400, which is a 
relatively low level. The number of doctors per 10,000 people 
increased from 11.2 to 15.7 nationwide, an annual rise of 2.4 
percent. A relatively high growth of 3.9 to 3.4 percent was 
recorded in Henan, Zhejiang, Hainan, Xinjiang, Tianjin, and 
Jiangsu. 
  4. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Guangdong had the 
highest index in quality of life. 
  Quality of life reflects consumption, wages, incomes, and 
social welfare. Viewed nationwide, the rate in 1992 rose by 172 
percent over 1978, an annual increase of 7.4 percent. It is one 
of the systems with the quickest growth. Viewed from the 
regions, a fast growth of 9.9 percent was registered in Jiangsu, 
9.3 percent in Zhejiang, 8.8 percent in Shanghai, and 8.3 
percent in Guangdong. The consumption level of inhabitants rose 
at an annual rate of 6.8 percent (after deducting the factor of 
price increases, same hereafter). Hainan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, 
Shanghai, Tibet, and Hubei had the quickest growth of 8.4 to 7.5 
percent. The per capita net income of peasants rose at an 
annual rate of 7.6 percent, with Jiangsu, Tibet, Zhejiang, 
Shandong, Tianjin, and Fujian registering a high rate of 10.8 to 
8.8 percent. The workers' average wages increased 4 percent 
annually, with Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and Tianjin 
achieving a high rate of 6.5 to 5.1 percent. 
<H5>  II. A Few Problems Which Merit Attention in Development </H5>
  1. The degree of coordination in economic and social 
development still needs improvement. Since reform and opening 
up, the uncoordinated economic and social development has been 
manifest in the following: 
  First, the improvement in the quality of life surpasses that 
in economic efficiency. Generally speaking, the improvement in 
the quality of life can be steady only when it is based on an 
increase in economic efficiency. Over the past 14 years, the 
nation's annual average growth was 7.4 percent, surpassing the 
6.2 percent of economic efficiency by 1.2 percentage point. 
Second, the improvement in population quality is slower than 
that in economic growth. The improvement in population quality 
is the motive force for economic growth. Because training 
people requires a relatively long time, growth is relatively 
slow. The average annual improvement in the nation's population 
quality was 2.1 percentage points lower than economic 
efficiency. If it is too low, it indicates that the two are not 
coordinated and that the increase in the number of technicians 
cannot meet the needs of economic growth. Third, the increase in 
revenue is lower than economic growth. Viewed nationwide, the 
growth in per capita revenue is slightly higher than that in per 
capita GDP. Nevertheless, the factor of price increases is not 
deducted in revenue. When it is done, the growth in the former 
will be slower than that of the latter. 
  2. Never slacken efforts to keep population strictly 
under control because population growth will directly hinder 
economic and social development. 
  The natural growth rate over the past 14 years experienced a 
process of drop, recovery, and drop again, reaching 11.6 per 
mill in 1992, a slight drop of 0.4 per mill from 1978. Viewed 
from the net increase of population over the past 14 years, the 
country had an increase of 209 million people, 21.7 percent or 
an annual rise of 1.4 percent or 14.94 million people. To 
further boost economic and social development, it is necessary 
to keep population strictly under control and lower the 
excessive growth rate. 
  3. Regional development is uneven and the gap between 
the east and west is further widening. 
  The coastal areas have developed rapidly since reform. Of 
the 13 areas with a high composite index in development over the 
past 14 years, 8 are coastal areas. Of the 14 areas ranking 
ahead in improving life quality, 9 are coastal areas. The areas 
with a rapid growth were basically the same as those which 
attained the advanced social development level in 1992. As the 
coastal areas took bigger strides in reform and opening up and 
maintained a high-growth competitive superiority, they could get 
the upper hand in both development level and growth. Because of 
their weak economic foundation prior to reform and their low 
base figure in 1978, Yunnan, Henan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, and 
other underdeveloped regions have developed rapidly since reform 
and opening up. Their growth rates propelled them into 
positions better than 16th place, with Yunnan ranking 6th. 
  However, the 1992 social development level of these regions 
still lagged behind 22d place. Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and 
Jilin, which had sharp contrasts in their development levels and 
growth, ranked 4th, 6th, and 8th, respectively in their 1992 
social development level but their growth in the past 14 years 
was 21st, 28th, and 25th, respectively. The development levels 
of Beijing and Tianjin were 1st and 3d but their growth ranked 
22d and 24th, respectively. The main reason is that these 
municipalities had a sound foundation. Since reform, however, 
there have been no major changes in the social set-up or an 
increase in economic efficiency. Therefore, their composite 
development indexes were relatively lower than other regions. 
It is noteworthy that the gap between the economically 
developed coastal regions and the underdeveloped remote areas is 
further widening.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- An official of China's 
Ministry of Justice said here today that the May 19 report of 
bodies like "Human Rights Watch-Asia" alleging that there were 
about 500 newly reported detainees from the 1989 anti-government 
turmoil was a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives. 
  The report alleged that there were nearly 500 newly reported 
detainees from the "June 4" incident of five years ago being 
held in the Beijing No.2 Prison and the Qinghe 
Reform-Through-Labor Farm. It claimed that they had been badly 
treated. 
  "This is a sheer fabrication with ulterior motives," the 
official said in an interview today. 
  The official said that in the "June 4" incident which took 
place five years ago, a small number of people were charged, 
according to the laws of China, with criminal responsibility for 
carrying out activities with the aim of sabotaging the 
government, or committing crimes, such as beating, smashing, 
looting, arson or killing, under cover of the chaotic situation. 
  The overwhelming majority of them had been released, either 
because they had been dealt with leniently, or because they had 
finished serving their terms, said the official, adding that 
there was no such thing as nearly 500 such detainees. 
  The so-called "new discovery" of the "Human Rights 
Watch-Asia" and other organizations was just their newly 
fabricated lies. 
  As to the allegation that the prisoners of the Beijing No.2 
Prison were forced to be quality inspectors for production of 
rubber gloves for export to the United States, the official said 
that investigations showed that the prison signed a contract in 
1991 with a factory in Beijing for inspecting the quality of 
rubber gloves on behalf of the manufacturer. 
  The contract contains a clear stipulation that the inspected 
gloves can only be marketed on the domestic market, and this has 
been effectively implemented, said the official. 
  He added that there had been no such exports inspected by 
prisoners to the U.S.A., nor had the Beijing No.2 Prison 
produced any gloves for export either. 
  The official said that in China, all prisons, including the 
Beijing No.2 Prison, have to treat prisoners humanely, according 
to law. The laws of China clearly stipulate that corporal 
punishment and violence against prisoners is forbidden, and "we 
act strictly according to relevant laws -- we carry out 
civilized management over prisoners according to law, and there 
are laws guaranteeing it." 
  China's criminal law stipulates that any acts of using 
bodily 
punishment or maltreatment of prisoners, as well as actions 
which seriously infringe on the legitimate rights of prisoners, 
should carry criminal responsibility. 
  People's procuratorates at various levels have opened 
special 
offices in prisons and assigned special officers to these 
prisons to oversee the implementation of these aspects of the 
legal code. 
  The allegation that the Beijing No.2 Prison had used 
beating, 
scolding or other bodily punishment to maltreat prisoners was a 
"completely groundless fabrication," the official said. 
  It is not the first time that the "Human Rights Watch-Asia" 
and other organizations have made up such sensational rumors 
about the conditions in China's prisons and spread them to 
mislead the public, the official said. 
  Lies will be lies, he said. Such malicious slanders by the 
"Human Rights Watch-Asia" and similar organizations can only 
show their hostility toward the Chinese people.

<F P=106> ["Backgrounder:" "10 Facts About U.S. Trade"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Here are the 10 facts 
about U.S. trade, and its relations with jobs and economy, as 
the country marked the 60th World Trade Week: 
  - U.S. two-way trade totaled 1,046 billion U.S. dollars in 
1993, with exports of 465 billion dollars and imports of 581 
billion dollars; 
  - Goods exports were 7.3 percent of the nation's gross 
domestic product in 1993, comparing with 1993 shares of GDP for 
Germany of 19.4 percent and for Japan of 8.6 percent; 
  - In 1993, total goods exports of the U.S. comprised 84 
percent manufactured goods, nine percent agricultural goods and 
seven percent of mineral fuels and crude materials; 
  - Currently, U.S. exports of goods and services support a 
total of more than 10 million U.S. jobs; 
  - From 1891 through 1970, the U.S. had an unbroken string of 
trade surpluses. After 1970, it had deficits in every year 
except 1973 and 1975; 
  - Canada is the U.S. leading foreign market for exports, 
followed by Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom and Germany. 
Canada is also the U.S. leading import supplier, followed by 
Japan, Mexico and China. 
  - The Commerce Department estimates that more than 37,000 
U.S. manufacturing companies export - slightly more than 
one-third of all U.S. companies that export, or 104,564 firms. 
  - About two-thirds of U.S. goods exports are by U.S.-owned 
multinational corporations, with over one-third by the U.S. 
parent corporation shipped to foreign affiliates; 
  - Exports of U.S. business services are over one-third as 
large as U.S. exports of goods; 
  - In the U.S., GATT is projected to create 1.4 million jobs 
in a decade, reduce federal deficit by 15 billion dollars by 
2004, and add 100 billion dollars a year to the nation's output.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The passage of the 
final pact of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
in Congress before the end of this year was at stake, Clinton 
administration officials said here today. 
  "There's a great deal at stake here," Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said at the opening ceremony of the World Trade 
Week 1994 held here, "We're going to ratify (the agreement), but 
it's not going to be easy." 
  The Congress was debating the revenue losses as the result 
of 
the GATT agreement, estimated at 14 billion U.S. dollars in five 
years, and whether the new World Trade Organization (WTO) meant 
the loss of the U.S. sovereignty to developing countries in 
trade disputes. 
  Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Ron Brown said that the 
Clinton 
administration was committed to GATT passage, "but it will not 
occur without the broad and vocal support of the entrepreneurial 
community." 
  "In the politically charged atmosphere of this election 
year," Brown said, "Congressional approval can still be blocked 
by a small group of people who are frightened of the future." 
  "We gotta have a GATT," Brown stressed, "The passage of GATT 
reflects the fact that government can and should make the 
American economy more competitive." 
  Clinton administration officials said that the GATT 
agreement, which reduces world tariffs by an average of 40 
percent, will create 1.4 million jobs in the U.S. and raise the 
annual income of the average American family by 1,600 dollars. 
  Treasury Secretary Bentsen, meanwhile, stressed that the 
Uruguay Round will make a contribution to deficit reduction in 
this country, reducing federal deficit by 15 billion dollars by 
the year 2004. 
  "This agreement also is a tax cut. It's a tax cut for 
American consumers. And it's a tax cut for American exports," 
Bentsen noted. 
  One-hundred and nine nations signed the Uruguay Round trade 
agreement in Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15, ending seven and a 
half years of negotiations. The agreement is subject to 
ratification by U.S. Congress. 
  This week, the United States observes the world trade week 
for the 60th consecutive year, with the theme "U.S. Exports = 
U.S. Jobs".

  [Text] Beirut, May 20 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher is going to pay another shuttle visit to the 
Middle East region next month, Charge d'Affaires of the United 
States to Lebanon Vincent Battle said today. 
  According to a report broadcast by Radio Lebanon, the U.S. 
diplomat today met with Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz 
in his office and told him that Christopher would make 
additional efforts to bridge differences between Syria and 
Israel over the future of Golan Heights. 
  The foreign minister told local reporters that his meeting 
with the U.S. charge d'affaires concentrated on the last round 
of talks Christopher held with Syrian leaders in Damascus and 
with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv. 
  He expected that another round of talks would be held (by 
the 
U.S. secretary of state) before the parties concerned are 
invited to resume their negotiations. 
  He pointed out the talks between Syria, Israel and the 
United 
States, despite their seriousness, are still far away from 
reaching an agreement among them. 
  "So it is necessary to make more endeavors and efforts in 
order to achieve this purpose," the foreign minister said.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (XINHUA) -- More than 50 experts 
from 12 countries attended an international conference on the 
peace process in the Middle East, which opened here today. 
  The three-day meeting is discussing the development and 
prospects of the peace process in the Middle East, the 
international community's role in keeping peace in the region, 
and the prospect of economic cooperation with the region. 
  Wang Changyi, Chinese assistant minister of foreign affairs, 
said at the opening ceremony that China will continue to promote 
a political solution to the Middle East problem as it has in the 
past, with the international community, especially countries in 
the Middle East region. 
  This is the first time China has held such a meeting. The 
director of the Peace and Development Research Institute of 
China, Hu Gang, said that the Chinese Government and people have 
shown keen concern for the peace process in the Middle East. 
  Experts among Chinese academics have also put great emphasis 
on research on the peace process in the region, and hope to 
research into the history, present and future of this process 
with experts in other countries in different fields and with a 
wide approach, in order to promote peace and development in the 
Middle East and the world, Hu said. 
  The conference received 36 papers, in which delegates 
expressed their views relating to the latest developments in the 
Middle East. 
  The experts are from Palestine, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, 
Tunisia, Morocco, Turkey, Japan, Britain, Russia, the U.S. and

  [Text] Cairo, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States and 
France differ over the lifting of the international sanctions 
against Iraq, according to a MIDDLE EAST NEWS AGENCY (MENA) 
report from Paris today. 
  The MENA report, citing the Paris weekly "L'EVENEMENT DE 
JEUDI," said that the United States, backed by Britain, still 
thinks it premature to lift the international embargo against 
Iraq, which was imposed after Iraq's August 1990 invasion of 
Kuwait. 
  However, the weekly said that France, backed by Russia and 
China, stands for lifting the sanctions. 
  MENA said that the change in the French stand came slowly 
after much hesitation. 
  Currently, French companies are preparing to secure the 
lion's share in Iraqi contracts after American companies 
clinched two big contracts in Saudi Arabia, the weekly said. 
  The economic incentives might have been the reason that 
prompted Paris to accelerate its steps toward lifting the 
embargo on Iraq, it added. 
  According to MENA, two events have shown the improvement in 
France's position on Iraq. The first one was an announcement by 
the French Government to terminate its participation in 
monitoring the embargo, and the second is the tendency to open a 
section to look after the French interests in Iraq. 
  "The Iraqis believe that the change in France's stand is a 
positive step toward better bilateral relations, and they are 
awaiting more to come in the coming few weeks," the news agency 
said.

  [Text] Washington May 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher wrote his Ukrainian counterpart today 
and affirmed Washington's support for Kiev's control over the 
disputed Crimea region. 
  "The territorial integrity of Ukraine within its present 
borders is something that the United States has consistently 
affirmed," State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said. 
  "The secretary recognized the responsible and conciliatory 
approach that Ukraine has adopted in dealing with developments 
in Crimea thus far and urged the Ukrainian Government to 
continue to exercise restraint," the spokesman said of 
Christopher's letter to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy 
Zlenko. 
  He described the Crimean parliament's decision to "adopt 
measures intended to loosen Ukraine's authority in the Black Sea 
peninsula as contradicting the Ukrainian Constitution. 
  "Russia has also made clear its continued support of the 
Ukraine's territorial integrity," McCurry said. 
  He denied reports that Ukraine might stop returning the 
dismantled nuclear weapons if Russia intervenes in Crimea as 
"baseless." The transfer "had been proceeding satisfactorily," 
McCurry said.

  [Text] London, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The United States and its 
Western allies were accused by a leading international 
think-tank today of taking a no-risk approach in solving some 
turmoils. 
  "It was a year in which the powers in the West... [ellipses 
as received] seemed to be suffering from a serious attack of 
strategic arthritis," the London-headquartered International 
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) said in "Stragetic Survey 
1993-1994", its review of the major strategic developments and 
trends of the past year. 
  "This affliction meant that few great risks were taken, or 
enduring commitments made, to address large strategic issues." 
  The IISS, an independent body with members in over 90 
countries, said the U.S. appeared to want a guarantee of its 
security policy and took an approach of "no risk insurance" to 
peacekeeping. 
  "By the end of the year the U.S. would insist on no 
open-ended commitments, assurance of victory without casualties, 
and an exit strategy," it said. "These are awesome guarantees to 
ask for in today's uncertain world." 
  "Overall... [ellipses as received] it was clear that passage 
from the organized, if undesirable, certainties of the Cold-War 
era to a perhaps sounder system will take longer than many 
initially thought. One major problem is the reluctance of 
global and regional powers to provide the necessary lead." 
  The survey said the U.S. President Bill Clinton had been 
preoccupied with domestic concerns and "blowing a very uncertain 
foreign policy trumpet". 
  The survey concluded that "effective strategic action 
requires a judicious combination of conservatism and risk: 
Addressing the issues that arise out of the recent turmoil will 
require more of the latter, and less of the former." 
  The IISS said Russia's use of the term "near abroad" to 
describe other former Soviet States had "particularly dangerous 
implications". 
  It said Russia did not wish to revive the Soviet Empire 
because it was unable to bear the responsibilities and costs. 
  However, "It wishes to assure that these states act only 
with 
Russian interests and desires in mind. If need be, it will 
meddle in their business, even militarily, to ensure this 
outcome," the IISS said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A green pigeon carrying 
an orange ribbon in its bill has flown off with top prize in the 
logo design contest for the fourth world women's conference, 
according to results published here today. 
  The selected logo is round, with the words "'95 Beijing" 
etched in white on the ribbon. The green pigeon design is the 
symbol of the United Nations Fourth World Women's Conference and 
represents women and equality. The ribbon also flows in the 
shape of a "C", the first letter in "China", indicating that 
China is the host country of the world women's conference. 
  The logo was designed by Professor Chen Hanmin from the 
Central Institute of Arts and Crafts. It was selected from the 
3,269 works sent in by Chinese citizens for the contest 
co-sponsored by the Chinese organizing committee of the world 
women's conference and 18 mass media organizations in Beijing. 
  All the entries were appraised by a group of experts from 
the 
Ministry of Culture, the Chinese Artists' Association and other 
organizations. 
  According to the organizers, the logo designers included 
artists, workers, peasants, soldiers, government officials, 
teachers and students. The chosen logo has been registered with 
the patent office, with a copyright belonging to the Chinese 
Organizing Committee of the World Women's Conference. 
  The Fourth World Women's Conference will be held in Beijing 
in September next year. It will be the largest international 
meeting ever hosted by China. All the member states of the UN 
will send high-level governmental delegations to attend the 
conference.

  [Text] Washington, May 23 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Agriculture 
Secretary Mike Espy said Monday [23 May] that Washington should 
renew the most-favored-nation [MFN] trade status to China. 
  Espy said his visit to China last October made him aware 
that 
"China represents a very important market for U.S. agricultural 
commodities, an important market that will be increasingly 
important in the next decade." 
  "If somehow we would rescind MFN to China, other nations 
against whom we compete would just come in and fill the vacuum," 
he noted. He has made these concerns very clear to the White 
House, he added. 
  Another cabinet member of the Clinton administration, Ronald 
Brown, secretary of commerce, indicated today that from the 
perspective of the Commerce Department, the answer to what the 
U.S. should do on the issue of China's MFN "is increasingly 
clear." 
  "We know that China is growing at about 13 percent a year or 
more. We know that China is going to spend probably 600 billion 
U.S. dollars in infrastructure projects between now and the year 
2000. I very much want American business and industry, small 
and large, to participate in the economic benefits of that 
growth in China," he said. 
  President Clinton is required to make up his mind whether to 
extend China's MFN with no conditions attached by June 3. It is 
"a difficult decision to make," Brown observed.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Strong Public Opinion Urges Renewal of China's </F>
Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status"] 
  [Text] The renewal of China's most-favored-nation [MFN] 
trading status, an issue between the United States and China, 
has reached a decisive stage this week. The mutually beneficial 
trade between the two countries should have developed 
unceasingly. In recent years, however, thare has been political 
controversy every year between spring and summer, and the reason 
does not lie on the Chinese side. The original purpose of the 
U.S. linkage of human rights to China's MFN trading status was 
to exert pressure on China. But China was not overwhelmed by 
such pressure. Conversely, the United States became caught in a 
dilemma designed by itself. There are now strong criticisms of 
the erroneous U.S. policy from within the United States; Asia, 
including Hong Kong; and even traditional U.S. allies in Europe. 
If the United States revokes China's MFN trading status, it 
will have to pay a huge political and economic price. 
  To extricate itself from the embarrassment caused by the 
linkage, the Clinton administration, following Secretary of 
State Christopher's visit to China in March this year, recently 
sent Michael Armacost to Beijing as the President's special 
envoy, to seek a way out with Chinese cooperation. China's 
sincerity in this regard is beyond question. It wants to 
steadily develop friendly ties with the United States, promote 
cooperation, and reduce difficulties. Nevertheless, China 
cannot abandon its sovereignty or sacrifice social stability to 
meet U.S. demands. 
  The differences in human rights concepts between China and 
the United States are quite natural. Human rights, which 
involves value judgments, belongs to the category of ideology. 
The late political leaders of the two countries, Mao Zedong and 
Nixon, could facilitate Sino-U.S. diplomatic ties precisely 
because they proceeded from a strategic height, surpassing their 
ideological differences, seeking common ground while reserving 
differences, and reaching cooperation based on mutual benefit. 
More than 20 years have elapsed since Nixon's world-shaking 
visit to China. If the ideological differences on human rights 
today lead to a retrogression in Sino-U.S. ties, it will be an 
adverse current in history. Despite the adverse current, we 
believe that the historical tide will continue to surge forward. 
It is noticeable that while talking about China's MFN recently, 
U.S. President Clinton also stressed the importance of U.S.-PRC 
economic and strategic cooperation. 
  Following the Beijing political disturbance in 1989, the 
U.S. 
administration linked the question of human rights with China's 
MFN. Apparently, the "linkage" policy proceeded from a mistaken 
estimate. Five years have passed and China's political situation 
is more stable and its pace of reform and opening up has been 
steadier and quicker. As stated by President Jiang Zemin last 
week, "a bad thing has turned into a good one." If we had 
failed to adopt resolute measures five years ago, the steady 
situation in China today would be impossible. During an 
interview given to the U.S. "FOREIGN AFFAIRS," Singaporean 
statesman Lee Kuan-yew also pointed out: "Anyone who attempts to 
set up another government in China cannot be steadier than the 
current Beijing regime. Just imagine what would have happened 
if the students in Tiananmen Square could have attained their 
goal and formed their government. These Tiananmen students went 
to France and the United States later. They have never ceased 
quarreling there. What would China be like if these students 
were in power? The situation would be worse than that in the 
Soviet Union. China is a huge and complicated country and it 
needs a powerful central government." 
  The development of events has proved that the United States' 
"linkage" policy is on the verge of bankruptcy. International 
observers have noted that it will be impossible for the U.S. 
Government to use the MFN issue to pressure China into accepting 
its human rights concept. If the United States revokes China's 
MFN trading status and fights a trade war, it will lose China's 
huge and potential market. In the current sharp economic 
competition between the developed nations, it is unlikely that 
the United States could bear the consequences. Information from 
Washington shows that the Clinton administration is considering 
a readjustment of this policy. It is now time to change its 
course. Many countries in the world have supported China's 
resumption of its status as a GATT signatory. Once China's 
status as a signatory of GATT is resumed, it should naturally be 
granted MFN trading status. If the United States wants to 
fundamentally change its policy, it should not obstruct China's 
reentry to GATT. 
  Whether the question of MFN is settled or not, the 
difference 
of views between China and the United States on human rights 
will exist for a long time to come. This should not hinder 
cooperation between the two countries. The Chinese Government 
has held discussions and exchanges with a number of foreign 
governments on the question of human rights. Last year, China 
set up a nongovernmental China Human Rights Society, which 
probed Chinese and foreign theory and practice on human rights, 
maintained contacts with foreign human rights organizations, and 
participated in international human rights conferences. When 
the question of human rights is "separated" from trade, China 
can similarly carry out fruitful exchanges with the United 
States in this field, based on mutual respect, equality, and 
justice, so as to constantly improve the situation of human 
rights.

<F P=106> [By Jiangsu Provincial Foreign Affairs Department] </F>
  [Text] The Jiangsu provincial goodwill delegation 
successfully concluded its U.S. visit and returned to Nanjing on 
the afternoon of 9 May. During the U.S. visit, Governor Chen 
Huanyou met with New York State Governor Mario Cuomo and Georgia 
Governor Zell Miller. Following friendly and frank discussions, 
both sides exchanged views on exchange and cooperation, reached 
a consensus, and signed four agreements in economic and science 
trade. The four agreements were: The Jiangsu-New York 
High-Technology Cooperation Agreement; the Jiangsu-Georgia 
Economic and Trade Development and Exchange Memorandum; the New 
York State Financial Investment Seminar in Jiangsu Memorandum; 
and the Jiangsu-New York Comprehensive Visual Testing Agreement. 
The U.S. visit marked the first meeting between Jiangsu and 
U.S. governors and the signing of the four agreements signified 
the actual progress that Jiangsu has achieved in developing 
exchange and cooperation with the United States. 
  To enhance understanding, deepen friendship, and expand 
cooperation, the Jiangsu delegation made extensive contacts with 
U.S. industry, commerce, science and technology, education, 
legal, and media circles and Chinese in the United States. It 
attended the opening ceremony of the Jiangsu investment and 
trade fair in New York City, visited Ford Motor Company, the 
Atlanta Science Park, and New York State University's High 
Technology Center. Governor Chen was invited to speak at the 
receptions sponsored by the U.S.-Chinese Relations National 
Committee; the New York State International Cooperation 
Committee; and the business, scientific, and educational circles 
of Georgia. He introduced China's opening-up policy, Jiangsu's 
economic development and investment environment, and the 
prospects of developing Sino-U.S. friendly exchange and 
cooperation to those at the receptions. He also fielded 
questions posed by business, political, and legal circles and 
reporters. Many heads of major corporations discussed with the 
delegation the possibility of expanding cooperation. The vice 
chairman of the Detroit-based (Carden) Company and his party 
took a special nighttime charter flight from Michigan to discuss 
investment with the delegation. New York and Georgia officials 
said they would organize heads of major corporations to visit 
Jiangsu to explore investment projects. Good results exceeding 
original expectations were achieved at the investment and trade 
fair in New York City, where agreements on 48 projects totalling 
$510 million were signed. 
  The delegation was warmly received everywhere by various 
circles and by Chinese in the United States. On its first day 
in New York, Chinese organizations in the eastern United States 
and Suxing International Trading Company jointly sponsored a 
grand reception. Some 250 people turned up at that warm 
reception. This showed that Overseas Chinese love their country 
and miss their hometowns. During a stopover in San Francisco 
following visits to New York and Georgia, the California 
governor forwarded a personal letter via his special 
representative to the delegation in which he congratulated the 
delegation's successful visit and expressed the wish to develop 
friendly cooperation. Chinese circles in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles hosted a grand reception to welcome Governor Chen and 
his party. The delegation also met with Hawaii Governor John 
Waihee to discuss exchange and cooperation. During the visit, 
Governor Chen met with UN Deputy Secretary General Ji Chaozhu 
and many responsible persons at the Chinese embassy and 
consulate in the United States. He also met with comrades 
working at Chinese enterprises in the United States and urged 
them to further emancipate their minds, seize the opportunity, 
run well overseas enterprises, and accelerate the pace of 
developing overseas markets. 
  Cao Keming, deputy secretary of the provincial CPC 
committee; 
Wang Rongbing, vice governor; Liang Baohua, secretary general of 
the provincial CPC committee; and Shi Shaoxiang, deputy 
secretary general of the provincial government, met the 
delegation at the airport. Other delegation members, including 
Chen Biting, Ye Jian, Chen Deming, Li Zhonghe, and Gu Mingdao, 
returned to Nanjing on the same plane.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 KYODO -- Two inspectors from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) left Beijing on 
Tuesday [24 May] for Pyongyang where they will join three other 
inspectors monitoring the ongoing refueling of a North Korean 
nuclear reactor. 
  Delegation leader Perricos Demetrius said that technical 
discussions with North Korean officials are expected to last two 
to four days and that all five IAEA inspectors hope to be coming 
out together. 
  The three-member IAEA team arrived in Pyongyang last week 
and 
immediately reported that refueling of the 5-megawatt Yongbyon 
experimental nuclear reactor had begun. 
  It is widely believed that discussions will center on 
allowing the IAEA to inspect and measure fuel rods in order to 
ascertain whether or not any fuel has been diverted to a 
suspected nuclear weapons program. 
  The arrival of the two IAEA inspectors coincides with 
renewed 
talks at the United Nations in New York concerning the 15-month 
nuclear impasse between the U.S. and North Korea.

<F P=106> [By reporter Bi Zheng (3968 2398): "Jilin Government Holds </F>
Trade and Investment Briefing in Seoul"] 
  [Text] The Jilin economic and trade fair held in the ROK 
entered the third day on 9 May, and encouraging achievements 
were made in economic relations and trade and in drawing in 
investment. On the morning of 9 May, the provincial government 
held a trade and investment briefing at the conference room of 
the Korea Exhibition Center. Sun Yaoting, deputy secretary 
general of the provincial government, chaired the briefing, and 
Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu gave an introduction on Jilin's 
natural resources, investment climate, foundations for 
agriculture, industry, education, and science and technology, 
current foreign economic relations and trade, and preferential 
policies. 
  Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu said: Jilin Province welcomes more 
foreign investors and Overseas Chinese to come to discuss trade 
and develop industries. The Jilin Provincial government will 
make utmost efforts to help promote all the projects of common 
interest that are mutually beneficial and will, as always, 
provide various preferential policies. On the basis of the 
preferential policies stipulated by the state, we have also 
drawn up 29 encouraging policies on import and export 
management, production and operation, and tax levy. These 
policies have four major characteristics. First, the areas in 
which foreign investment can be made are relaxed even more, and 
we encourage investment to be made chiefly in developing 
enterprises producing export products, enterprises with advanced 
technology, enterprises engaged in building infrastructural 
facilities and exploiting resources, the pillar industries and 
superior industries Jilin will develop on a priority basis, 
fund- and technology-intensive industries, and the technical 
transformation of the existing enterprises. Second, the 
measures for attracting foreign investment will be more flexible 
and varied. In addition to money and technology investment to 
build joint ventures or exclusively foreign-funded enterprises, 
we also allow some investors to invest with materials to buy the 
property rights of our enterprises, develop Chinese-foreign 
limited liability stock companies, or carry out land development 
in large areas. Third, even more preferential policies will be 
applied to the levies of taxes and fees from foreign-funded 
enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises which invested more 
than $10 million in the areas we have encouraged will have their 
taxes reduced and levied at the rate of 15 percent when their 
tax reduction and exemption periods expire and when they have 
obtained approval from tax organizations. When foreign firms 
use the profits they have earned from the "three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises" to reinvest in building the 
enterprises in the fields we encourage, the income tax they have 
paid for the profits which they use to reinvest will be 
refunded. Fourth, the procedures for screening and approving the 
establishment of foreign-funded enterprises will be simplified, 
and the procedures will be handled by the foreign economic 
relations bureau in a unified manner. 
  When Vice Governor Quan Zhezhu finished his introduction, 
responsible persons of relevant provincial government 
departments answered questions raised by pertinent ROK 
personages. The briefing proceeded in a warm and friendly 
atmosphere. 
  According to incomplete statistics compiled up to the 
evening 
of 9 May, transactions reached at the trade fair had totaled 
$44.1 million, and agreement was reached on 81 foreign 
investment projects involving $840 million, of which $521 
million would be made by foreign firms. Of these projects, 51 
were contracts involving $109.52 million, of which $79.77 
million would be foreign funds.

<F P=106> [By Chang Weimin: "Saudis Hope To Develop Oil Jointly"] </F>
  [Text] Proposals by the visiting Saudi Arabian oil 
minister are expected to turn into co-operative projects. 
  Hisham Nazir, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and 
Mineral Resources, suggested joint development of China's oil. 
  Nazir, on his first trip to China, discussed petroleum 
exploration, development and processing with high-ranking 
Chinese officials. 
  According to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), which 
arranged the visit, Nazir made the proposals to President Jiang 
Zemin, CNPC president Wang Tao and Sheng Huaren, president of 
the China Petrochemical Corp. 
  An oil delegation from Saudi Arabia is expected to visit 
China later to explore further possibilities. 
  The delegates are expected to visit petroleum processing 
projects in Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province and Dagang in 
Tianjin, at which time specific details will be discussed, a 
CNPC official said. 
  Nazir said Saudi Arabia hopes to set up refineries in China 
to help meet China's domestic needs. 
  With the refineries, Saudi Arabia would ensure China a 
stable, long-term supply of crude oil, he said. 
  Saudi Arabia expects to set up the same type of 
joint-venture 
refineries it has in the United States, South Korea and the 
Philippines, Nazir said. 
  Economic and trade ties between the two nations can be 
developed, since their economies are complementary, he said, 
adding that Saudi Arabia wants to tap the China market. 
  Saudi Arabia, a leading oil producer, would also be able to 
help supply the crude needed for China's development, Nazir said. 
  He said he hopes Jiang Zemin will support his proposals and 
help forge agreements as soon as possible. 
  Jiang said China will carefully consider the Saudi oil 
minister's proposals and support any deals that promote 
bilateral co-operation. 
  China has considerable undeveloped oil reserves. Despite its 
large output, domestic supply cannot meet the country's soaring 
demand. 
  China produced 142 million tons of crude oil last year. It 
also imported, officially, 15 million tons of crude oil and 20 
million tons of oil products, although sources say the figures 
are probably low. 
  Experts say that imports will probably increase since the 
country is planning for 9 per cent economic growth over the next 
seven years.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, 
met here today with Congolese President Pascal Lissouba. 
  Qiao spoke highly of the efforts Lissouba made for the 
establishment of Sino-Congolese diplomatic ties 30 years ago, 
and called him "an old friend of the Chinese people." 
  China and the Congo, as developing countries, both faced the 
arduous tasks of developing their economy, Qiao said. 
  "China, within its capability, would like to provide aid to 
all developing countries, including the Congo," he said. 
"Although the help is limited, it is an expression of 
friendship." 
  He also stressed that all countries should develop their own 
countries according to their own situation. 
  Lissouba said that the Congolese people would never forget 
the support and help from the Chinese people over the 30 years 
after the setting-up of bilateral diplomatic ties. 
  The two leaders also exchanged views on issues of common 
concern.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Zhang Zhen, 
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, met here today 
with Konan Koffi, visiting Defense Minister of Cote d'Ivoire, 
and his party. 
  Zhang said that China and Cote d'Ivoire, though far away 
from 
each other, have developed good relations since the two 
countries established diplomatic ties in 1983. 
  As developing countries, China and Cote d'Ivoire are faced 
with the common task of nationwide construction and development 
of the economy. 
  Zhang spoke highly of the Cote d'Ivoire Government's stance 
that there is only one China and that Taiwan is an inalienable 
part of its territory. 
  During the meeting, Zhang also briefed Koffi on China's 
economic development and the construction of its armed forces. 
  He expressed the belief that Koffi's visit would enhance the 
friendly relations between the armed forces of the two countries. 
  Koffi told Zhang that just as China does, Cote d'Ivoire pays 
much attention to the safeguarding of its territorial integrity, 
its people and its traditions. 
  He noted that Cote d'Ivoire recognizes the People's Republic 
of China as the sole legitimate government of China and Taiwan 
as one of its provinces. 
  Chinese State Councillor and Defense Minister Chi Haotian 
took part in the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--General 
Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission 
[CMC], met Konan Koffi, Cote d'Ivoire defense minister, this 
afternoon. During the meeting, Zhang Zhen said: Taiwan has 
always been a part of China, and we do not allow the pursuit of 
"Taiwan independence" or the so-called "one China, one Taiwan." 
Any attempt to achieve "Taiwan independence" or "one China, one 
Taiwan" will fail. 
  During their cordial talks, General Zhang Zhen expressed his 
appreciation of Cote d'Ivoire's one-China policy, namely that it 
only recognizes the PRC Government as the sole legitimate 
government representing China. 
  Zhang Zhen pointed out that all disputes should be resolved 
through friendly negotiations. 
  Zhang Zhen stressed that the Chinese Army is the people's 
army, which always serves the people's interests, and that 
China's national defense policy is of a defensive nature and is 
absolutely for self-defense. He added that the assertion of the 
so-called "China threat" spread by some Western people is 
groundless. 
  The general hoped for the continuous development of the 
friendly relations between the two countries and the two 
countries' armed forces. 
  Among those present at the meeting were General Chi Haotian, 
state councilor and defense minister; and Lt. General Li Jing, 
deputy chief of staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

<F P=106> [Article by Jean Leclerc du Sablon in Beijing: </F>
"Aerospatiale Jockeying for Position in China"] 
  [Text] Aerospatiale has decided "to make long-term 
investments in China," announced Louis Gallois, its president 
and one of the first major French CEO's to have come to study 
opportunities opened by last January's normalization of 
relations between Paris and Beijing. Among his priorities: To 
collaborate with the Chinese in the space industry field. 
  "We must have a greater presence and convince the Chinese 
authorities and companies that we are in China for the long 
run," insisted the French manufacturer. With 43 Airbus ordered 
by China, of which only 12 are already in operation (compared 
with 225 Boeings and 100 or so McDonnell Douglas aircraft), 
Aerospatiale's share of the Chinese market is far below its 
world market share of 30 percent. 
  There are various reasons for France's aerospace industry's 
poor performance in China. The sale of Dassault Mirage 2000-5 
fighters to Taiwan precipitated political sanctions which 
affected several sectors. U.S. manufacturers, supported by 
their government and by procurement policy guidelines of the 
Chinese authorities, managed to generate "purchasing habits" in 
China. 
<H5>  Pilot Training Center </H5>
  "We can no longer use the political situation as an excuse; 
we must make substantial efforts to achieve a share that we 
consider just," Louis Gallois notes. 
  The Chinese authorities are getting ready to welcome "in a 
few days" a technical mission sent by Aerospatiale to explore 
potential areas for cooperation with Chinese industrials, 
including satellites. "Long March" rockets are "competitors 
equipped with modern technologies, but here, too, we can find a 
way to collaborate, through technical exchange and concept 
adjustment," Louis Gallois explains. "China is important as a 
market, but also because of its existing technological know-how." 
  Other goals of the group include the projected Airbus' 
training center for civilian and possibly military pilots and 
technicians to be set up near Beijing Airport, as well as a 
storehouse for spare parts. The European Union is currently 
considering lifting the ban on military cooperation it imposed 
after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. 
  Also in progress is the development of a light helicopter in 
partnership with China (25 percent), Singapore (16 percent), and 
Eurocopter. Beside Airbus, Louis Gallois has been pushing the 
French-Italian ATR 42 [Regional Transport Plane] turboprop. So 
far, the Chinese authorities' interest has been nonexistent. 
For political reasons, no doubt, but also due to a kind of 
snobbishness: They think turboprops are "backward." As a 
result, regional airlines have purchased jets, which epitomize 
"modernity." However, they now complain that they cannot fill 
them to capacity.

  [Text] Beijing has stepped up surveillance over 
dissidents, including those who have left the city centres or 
gone into business. Friends of dissident intellectual Zhou Duo, 
who staged a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square the day before 
the massacre, claimed he had been subjected to harassment by 
security forces. This is in spite of the fact that last month, 
Mr Zhou, a sociologist, had left the capital to set up a 
business in Tianjin. 
  "Zhou is selling cosmetics and other consumer products with 
the help of a cousin," a friend said. "However, he is under 
constant surveillance by Tianjin police and his business 
prospects have been hurt." 
  In March, Mr Zhou, and two other intellectuals, wrote a 
private letter to National People's Congress Chairman Qiao Shi 
pleading for a faster pace of reform and labour rights. One of 
the other petitioners has also been put under 24-hour police 
surveillance in spite of his having forsworn protest actions in 
the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the massacre. 
  Meanwhile the associates of Beijing University law lecturer 
and labour activist Yuan Hongbing said they expected him to be 
charged and put on trial this year. With two other dissidents, 
Yuan was detained by police in early March for allegedly forming 
an underground labour organisation and for organising a petition 
demanding worker rights. The associates said his wife had been 
informed that Yuan had been "formally arrested" and that 
investigation into his case by state security agents would be 
completed at the end of June. Yuan's case would then be handed 
over to the procuratorate, which would determine when the 
judicial procedure would start. 
  "The authorities have told me nothing about the nature of 
his 
`crime'," friends quoted Yuan's wife as saying. "They have not 
even told me where he is being held. I am not allowed to send 
him medicine and clothing." She added Yuan had stomach, skin 
and liver ailments, and she was frustrated by the news blackout. 
  Sources in Beijing University said its famous law faculty 
had 
been subjected to tight surveillance owing to the radicalism of 
several young scholars. Graduate student Wang Jiaqi, who was 
detained with Yuan, fled the country last month. 
  The sources said at least one other graduate student there 
had gone into hiding to escape detention. The student, who has 
not been seen since March, is believed to have returned to his 
native province.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] In denying a Western news agency's report that 
dissident Wei Jingsheng was about to be indicted on charges of 
treason, China's Public Security Ministry went by the book -- 
literally. 
  The Public Security Internal Work Handbook, published last 
July, contains a whole section on how to deal with media reports 
"unfavourable to the public security departments" and the 
methods to be used in evading sensitive questions raised by 
reporters. 
  "When reports are not accurate or twist the truth the Public 
Security Bureau (PSB) shall not keep silent instead it shall 
take immediate action to tell the truth and demand the news 
organisation corrects its mistake," the handbook states. "If 
you express no views or make no protest, it means that you will 
have acquiesced in the report," it adds. 
  Last Friday, the ministry issued a strong denial of a United 
Press International report that a ministry spokesman had 
confirmed the authorities had decided to start legal proceedings 
against Wei, saying the report had been fabricated with ulterior 
motives. 
  In cases where a report is "accurate but leaves your unit in 
a bad situation because it only reports the mistakes of an 
individual PSB unit or officer", the handbook says, the unit 
should "modestly admit" the mistake and express willingness to 
correct it. "It will be a major error of judgment if you make 
no response or refuse to admit your mistakes or even threaten 
the news organisation," it says. However, the handbook warns 
that when PSB officers grant interviews to reporters they must 
"always keep in mind the need to protect secrets", something 
which would include the impending trial of Wei. 
  "In order to get what they think to be important 
information, 
reporters may ask one question after another or talk in a 
roundabout way so as to get to the bottom of something. 
  "Some may even try to establish a relationship with you or 
invite you to dinner. In such circumstance, you must be on your 
guard, make acute responses to questions, avoid making 
indiscreet remarks and never leak secrets for profit," it says. 
But no mention is made of what should be done in the event that 
secrets are accidentally or inadvertently leaked. The handbook 
does however, contain useful tips for PSB officers on staging 
press conferences and avoiding those "harsh questions" 
journalists sometime ask. 
  Officers can use various tactics to "get out of trouble" at 
press conferences such as delaying evading, admitting, denying 
and returning the question, the handbook says, and even offers 
some stock phrases to be used in awkward situations. For 
example: "This is not a matter of yes or no" "that depends on 
your point of view", or "to understand this question, one must 
first understand the background". 
  The 800-page handbook covers everything from handling top 
secret documents to how to answer a telephone call from a 
superior officer.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052) and Zou Aigou </F>
(6760 1947 0948; Beijing XINHUA Domestic Service in Chinese at 
1149 GMT on 23 May transmits a service message replacing the 
following item] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- Premier of the State 
Council Li Peng conducted a six-day inspection of Jiangsu from 
17 to 22 May. During the inspection, he pointed out that since 
the Opium War, the Chinese people have been struggling for over 
150 years and they are now faced with an excellent opportunity 
for development. As long as we seize this opportunity, follow 
the direction given in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, handle well the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability, forge 
unity, and strive forward, China has great hope for development. 
  Li Peng and his party, accompanied by Chen Huanyou, 
secretary 
of the Jiangsu provincial CPC committee and governor of Jiangsu, 
and travelling along the Grand Canal, inspected commodity grain 
production bases and state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises in Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and Zhengjiang, 
and visited farmers' families and talked with local cadres and 
the masses. 
  The great land along the Changjiang and Huaihe in early 
summer is surging with vitality. Li Peng said he had been in 
Jiangsu several times and had witnessed Jiangsu's development 
and changes amid reform and opening up. Jiangsu's conscientious 
implementation of the principle and policies of the CPC Central 
Committee has brought about rapid economic development and 
marked improvement in the living standards of urban and rural 
citizens, and it has positively contributed to the state. He 
continued, saying that in the course of the economic 
development, it is not only necessary for localities to take 
their local interests into consideration, but also to 
subordinate themselves to the requirements of the state and 
handle well the relationship between the state and localities. 
He expressed the hope that Jiangsu would make persistent 
efforts and score even greater development. 
  The main purpose of Li Peng's current tour is to inspect 
state- owned large and medium-sized enterprises and village and 
township enterprises in Jiangsu. Li Peng made detailed 
inquiries into the production and operations of the Lianyungang 
Port Affairs Bureau, Yangzhou Transport and Container Limited 
Company, Yangzhou Passenger Bus Manufacturing Plant, and 
Zhengjiang Jiangkui Enterprise Limited Company. He noted that 
operations at many state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises were good. He said they produce marketable products 
to compete both on the domestic and foreign markets. They 
possess advanced technologies. They exercise strict management. 
Their products are very competitive, and their economic 
efficiency is high. But we should also see to the fact that in 
the course of deepening the reform and of moving toward a market 
economy, some enterprises have met with varying degrees of 
difficulties, resulting in low economic efficiency. This has 
been caused by many factors. We should not only have full 
confidence in helping state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises operate well, but also attach importance to existing 
problems at state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. He 
pointed out the need for the state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises to face up to market competition; always strive to 
make their products adapt to domestic and foreign markets' 
needs; stress marketing; actively develop markets; establish 
good mechanisms adapted to the socialist market economy; attach 
importance to technological progress; and enhance reserve forces 
for enterprise development and competitiveness. He said it is 
groundless for some to equate state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises with low efficiency enterprises. We have full 
confidence and we believe that we will surely help state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises operate well through our 
efforts. 
  Whether in Huaiyang, located in the hinterland of north 
Jiangsu, or in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, on the two banks of Chang 
Jiang, Li Peng has shown great concern over the problems of 
agriculture, villages, and peasants. In Yanzhuang Village, 
Gaogou Town, Lianshui County, he held a forum with cadres at 
provincial, city, county, town, village levels and cadres from 
peasants' groups on the issues concerning ways to increase 
agricultural production, readjust agricultural structure, and 
improve the living standards of peasants. In Wuan Township, 
Gaoyou City, he checked the growth of summer grain in the field 
and visited peasant families. In Longshan Village, Dantu 
County, he inspected the Longshan United Eel Corporation to 
learn about the development of the situation. He stressed: 
Agriculture is a major matter of vital importance to the 
state's overall economic situation and social stability, and its 
development must receive attention. Under the circumstance of 
fairly low agricultural efficiency, in particular, the role of 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy must not 
be shaken. He hoped that Jiangsu would fully display its 
abilities in developing a diversified economy after stabilizing 
food production; increase per mu area yield and pay attention to 
efficiency at the same time after securing land for growing 
grain; and support the development of the collective economy and 
village and town enterprises in rural areas, as well as 
gradually develop optimum scale farming, after stabilizing and 
improving the household-based system of contracted 
responsibility with remuneration linked to output. 
  During his inspection, Li Peng came to Huaian -- the 
hometown 
of Zhou Enlai, a great proletarian revolutionary. He paid a 
visit to the memorial hall and former residence of Zhou Enlai 
and viewed an exhibition of Zhou Enlai's feats. He said: We 
should emulate Comrade Zhou Enlai's lofty moral character -- his 
absolute devotion to the cause of revolution and his deep love 
for the people. 
  After hearing the briefing of the Jiangsu provincial party 
committee and government, Li Peng emphatically noted: Price 
hikes have slowed down over the past two months, but stabilizing 
the market and commodity prices remain an important task of 
governments at various levels. 
  Discussing the gap between south and north Jiangsu, Li Peng 
said: Judging from the national standard, Jiangsu is 
economically developed; however, there is certain difference 
between the north and the south of the province when the two 
areas are compared with one another. South Jiangsu, which has 
become prosperous first, is responsible for helping the north 
develop economy, so that it will also become rich as soon as 
possible. North Jiangsu has its own superiority -- in land, 
resources, and labor, for example -- and its key tasks at 
present are to further solve the transportation problem and 
improve its technical and management levels, so as to gradually 
narrow the difference. 
  Also participating in the inspection tour were Chen Jinhua, 
He Chunlin, Liu Jiang, Huang Zhendong, Guo Lin, Jiang Yunbao, 
and responsible persons of relevant departments under the State 
Council.

<F P=106> [By reporters Yin Xuecheng (3009 1331 2052) and Zou Aigou </F>
(6760 1947 0948] 
  [Text] Nanjing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- Premier of the State 
Council Li Peng conducted a six-day inspection of Jiangsu from 
17 to 22 May. During the inspection, he pointed out that since 
the Opium War, the Chinese people have been struggling for over 
150 years and they are now faced with an excellent opportunity 
for development. As long as we resolutely seize this 
opportunity, follow the direction given in Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, handle well the relationship between reform, 
development, and stability, forge unity, and strive forward, 
China has great hope for development. 
  Li Peng and his party, accompanied by Chen Huanyou, 
secretary 
of the Jiangsu provincial CPC committee and governor of Jiangsu, 
and travelling along the Grand Canal, inspected commodity grain 
production bases and state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises in Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou, and Zhengjiang, 
and visited farmers' families and talked with local cadres and 
the masses. 
  The great land along the Changjiang and Huaihe in early 
summer is surging with vitality. Li Peng said he had been in 
Jiangsu several times and had witnessed Jiangsu's development 
and changes amid reform and opening up. Jiangsu's conscientious 
implementation of the principle and policies of the CPC Central 
Committee has brought about rapid economic development and 
marked improvement in the living standards of urban and rural 
citizens, and it has positively contributed to the state. He 
continued, saying that in the course of the economic 
development, it is not only necessary for localities to take 
their local interests into consideration, but also to 
subordinate themselves to the requirements of the state and 
handle well the relationship between the state and localities. 
He expressed the hope that Jiangsu would make persistent 
efforts and score even greater development. 
  The main purpose of Li Peng's current tour is to inspect 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and village and 
township enterprises in Jiangsu. Li Peng made detailed 
inquiries into the production and operations of the Lianyungang 
Port Affairs Bureau, Yangzhou Transport and Container Limited 
Company, Yangzhou Passenger Bus Manufacturing Plant, and 
Zhengjiang Jiangkui Enterprise Limited Company. He noted that 
operations at many state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises were good. He said they produce marketable products 
to compete both on the domestic and foreign markets. They 
possess advanced technologies. They exercise strict management. 
Their products are very competitive, and their economic 
efficiency is high. But we should also see to the fact that in 
the course of deepening the reform and of moving toward a market 
economy, some enterprises have met with varying degrees of 
difficulties, resulting in low economic efficiency. This has 
been caused by many factors. We should not only have full 
confidence in helping state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises operate well, but also attach importance to existing 
problems at state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. He 
pointed out the need for the state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises to face up to market competition; always strive to 
make their products adapt to domestic and foreign markets' 
needs; stress marketing; actively develop markets; establish 
good mechanisms adapted to the socialist market economy; attach 
importance to technological progress; enhance reserve forces for 
enterprise development and competitiveness; and to stress 
national structure and economic benefits in the areas of 
development. He said it is groundless for some to equate 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises with low 
efficiency enterprises. We have full confidence and we believe 
that we will surely help state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises operate well through our efforts. 
  Whether in Huaiyang, located in the hinterland of north 
Jiangsu, or in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, on the two banks of Chang 
Jiang, Li Peng has shown great concern over the problems of 
agriculture, villages, and peasants. In Yanzhuang Village, 
Gaogou Town, Lianshui County, he held a forum with cadres at 
provincial, city, county, town, village levels and cadres from 
peasants' groups on the issues concerning ways to increase 
agricultural production, readjust agricultural structure, and 
improve the living standards of peasants. In Wuan Township, 
Gaoyou City, he checked the growth of summer grain in the field 
and visited peasant families. In Longshan Village, Dantu 
County, he inspected the Longshan United Eel Corporation to 
learn about the development of the situation. He stressed: 
Agriculture is a major matter of vital importance to the 
state's overall economic situation and social stability, and its 
development must receive attention. Under the circumstance of 
fairly low agricultural efficiency, in particular, the role of 
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy must not 
be shaken. He hoped that Jiangsu would fully display its 
abilities in developing a diversified economy after stabilizing 
food production; increase per mu area yield and pay attention to 
efficiency at the same time after securing land for growing 
grain; and support the development of the collective economy and 
village and town enterprises in rural areas, as well as 
gradually develop optimum scale farming, after stabilizing and 
improving the household-based system of contracted 
responsibility with remuneration linked to output. 
  During his inspection, Li Peng came to Huaian -- the 
hometown 
of Zhou Enlai, a great proletarian revolutionary. He paid a 
visit to the memorial hall and former residence of Zhou Enlai 
and viewed an exhibition of Zhou Enlai's feats. He said: We 
should emulate Comrade Zhou Enlai's lofty moral character -- his 
absolute devotion to the cause of revolution and his deep love 
for the people. 
  After hearing the briefing of the Jiangsu provincial party 
committee and government, Li Peng emphatically noted: Price 
hikes have slowed down over the past two months, but stabilizing 
the market and commodity prices remain an important task of 
governments at various levels.

areas are compared with one another. South Jiangsu, which has

narrow the difference.

  [Text] Nanjing, May 23 (XINHUA) --China's Premier Li Peng 
made a six-day tour of east China's Jiangsu Province from May 17 
to 22. 
  Accompanied by Chen Huanyou, secretary of Jiangsu Provincial 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and governor of 
Jiangsu, Premier Li inspected some grain production centers and 
large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the cities of 
Lianyungang, Huaiyin, Yangzhou and Zhenjiang. 
  He also visited the homes of farmers and held discussions 
with local cadres and residents. 
  He said that he had personally seen the development and 
changes during the reform and opening-up drive in Jiangsu, and 
he praised the province for having conscientiously carried out 
the principles and policies of the central government, having 
achieved a rapid economic development, having remarkably 
improved the urban and rural people's living standards, and 
having made important contributions to the state. 
  During the process of economic development, he stressed, the 
localities should keep in mind the local interests on one hand, 
and serve the needs of the whole country on the other. 
  He said that many of the country's large and medium-sized 
enterprises were getting along well, for they have high-level 
technology and management and their products sell well in 
domestic and overseas markets. But, he added, there were also 
some enterprises with low economic efficiency and other problems 
caused by various factors. 
  "We should have full confidence that the large and 
medium-sized enterprises can be well-operated and also pay close 
attention to the existing problems in the large and medium-sized 
enterprises," Premier Li said. 
  He pointed out that agriculture was a big issue in the 
overall situation of the national economy and for social 
stability. 
  "It is necessary to pay more attention to the development of 
agriculture, and the position of agriculture as a foundation can 
not be shaken, particularly at present when agricultural 
efficiency is still low," he stressed. 
  He expressed the hope that while stabilizing grain 
production, Jiangsu would further develop a diversified economy 
and promote the development of rural collective economy and 
rural industrial enterprises. 
  When listening to the reports of Jiangsu party and 
government 
leaders, Premier Li said that in the past two months, the rate 
of price increases had tended to drop. However, he added, to 
stabilize prices was still an important task of governments at 
all levels. 
  Accompanying Premier Li during the inspection tour were 
leading members of departments of the State Council.

Peng Stresses During Visit to Shanghai That Pudong Policy 
Remains Unchanged"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 23 May -- Chinese Premier Li Peng as he 
toured Shanghai today reiterated that the central policy toward 
Pudong remains unchanged. Informed sources revealed that 
Premier Li Peng and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday 
afternoon. Accompanying them to Shanghai are Chen Jinhua, State 
Planning Commission minister, and He Chunlin, State Council 
General Office deputy secretary general. 
  Premier Li Peng and his entourage toured and inspected the 
"Jinqiao Export Processing Zone" and "Waigaoqiao Bonded Area," 
two of the four small key development zones in the New Pudong 
District, in company with Shanghai party secretary Wu Bangguo 
and Mayor Huang Ju. 
  After listening to reports by leaders of the New Pudong 
District, Premier Li Peng and his entourage visited the bonded 
capital goods market showing keen interest. 
  The Shanghai Hitachi Electrical Appliance Company Limited, a 
Sino-Japanese joint venture which was visited by General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin earlier this month, welcomed Premier Li 
Peng and his entourage. It was extremely rare for both the 
highest party and government leaders to visit on two different 
occasions in the same month the same foreign-capital company. 
The Chinese and Japanese management staff of "Shanghai Hitachi" 
felt greatly honored. 
  This afternoon, Premier Li Peng listened to work reports by 
Shanghai party and government leaders and persons-in-charge of 
departments at the municipal party committee office building in 
Kangping Road. It has been learned that Li Peng will assist 
Shanghai in solving certain practical difficulties during his 
visit.

<F P=106> [By reporter Gu Yuezhong (7357 2588 1813)] </F>
  [Text] Zhengzhou, 18 May (XINHUA) -- During a fact-finding 
tour of rural Henan, Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee 
of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and member of the 
CPC Central Committee Secretariat, said emphatically: We should 
carry out the overall task of the entire party in close 
conjunction with the central task of economic construction, and 
strengthen party building while, in practice, deepening reform, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability so as to ensure 
the completion of various reform and construction tasks. 
  After attending commemorative activities in Zhengzhou and 
Lankao on the 30th anniversary of Comrade Jiao Yulu's death, Hu 
Jintao, accompanied by Li Changchun, secretary of the Henan 
Provincial CPC Committee, inspected some villages in eastern and 
northern Henan from 14-18 May. He visited some village and town 
enterprises, as well as some peasant households, and was very 
pleased to witness rapid economic development, remarkable 
improvements in peasants' lives, and strong motivation among 
cadres and people there. In Kaifeng, Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, and 
Zhengzhou, Hu Jintao held informal discussions with responsible 
persons from city, county, township (town), and village party 
organizations, during which they studied ways to strengthen and 
improve party building, especially the construction of primary 
party organizations in rural areas. During his cordial 
conversations with grass-roots cadres and people, some peasants 
remarked that "we are quite satisfied with our lives now," upon 
which he said admonishingly: "While it is good to be satisfied, 
you should not be complacent. Do not neglect hard work, thrift, 
and arduous struggle after you have become better off. Although 
the economy has developed, you should keep breaking new ground 
and aim for an even higher level of development." Upon hearing 
peasants' complimentary remarks that "the party's policies and 
leadership are good," he said: "Given the party Central 
Committee's good policies and sound grass-roots bodies, coupled 
with concerted efforts by all to achieve a fairly comfortable 
standard of living, there is great hope for building a new 
socialist countryside." 
  During his informal discussions with local and grass-roots 
leading comrades, Hu Jintao pointed out: The situation across 
the country is now favorable as both the leadership and the rank 
and file of the entire party are accelerating the pace of 
building a socialist market economic structure in accordance 
with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. The 
situation in Henan is also favorable. A decade of practice, as 
well as some advanced typical experiences which we have come 
across over the past few days, fully attest to the fact that 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics -- including his thinking that it is 
imperative to uphold and improve the party's leadership, as well 
as to strengthen and improve party building, in carrying out 
socialist modernization -- is entirely correct. During our 
current efforts to further consolidate and improve on the 
favorable situation, deepen reform, promote development, and 
maintain stability, we should also rely on the party's correct 
leadership, as well as on the efforts by party organizations at 
all levels and the broad ranks of CPC members to unify and rally 
people so that the party's correct policy decisions will be 
translated into conscientious popular actions. The party holds 
the key to maintaining its basic line for 100 years without 
wavering; it also holds the key to deepening reform, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability in accordance with the 
demands of the basic line. Success in party building will 
provide a fundamental guarantee for success in the cause of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Hu Jintao noted: Building up the party in strict 
accordance with its basic line is a fundamental experience in 
this respect during the new period. To apply this experience, 
we should now strengthen all facets of party building, improve 
the standards of governance and leadership, and heighten the 
rallying power, appeal, and fighting skills of party 
organizations at all levels, while closely linking these efforts 
with the way we deepen reform, promote development, and maintain 
stability in practice. In building up the party, we should take 
overall interests into account, submit to and serve overall 
interests, improve party building by maintaining and promoting 
overall interests, and consolidate and expand overall interests 
by strengthening party building. 
  On strengthening and improving primary party organizations 
in 
rural areas, Hu Jintao said: Primary party organizations in 
rural areas should rally and lead peasants and people toward a 
fairly comfortable standard of living, vigorously develop the 
rural economy, enrich the collective sector of the economy, 
encourage hard work as a way to prosper, follow the path of 
common prosperity, develop the "two civilizations," and build a 
new socialist countryside, taking these efforts as their own 
fundamental tasks. The key to accomplishing these tasks lies in 
building up the leadership bodies and in selecting qualified 
leaders. With good leaders, we can unify a group of people who, 
in turn, can spur on all villagers; we can also constantly open 
up new avenues, and bring rapid changes to the less developed 
villages. We should show concern for and cherish village 
cadres, inspire their initiative, and support and protect 
hard-working comrades. Particular efforts should be made to 
step up the training of township and village cadres in 
accordance with local conditions, so as to improve their quality 
in an all-around manner. In light of the realities in rural 
areas, we should institute an incentive-based mechanism by which 
qualified personnel of remarkable caliber at the grass-roots 
level will show their talent and perform meritorious services. 
We should take effective measures to ensure a steady source of 
village cadres to replenish the existing pool. We should devote 
major efforts to cultivating active elements and recruiting 
party members from among outstanding youths at the forefront of 
production in rural areas, so as to expand the unduly small 
ranks of young party members in the countryside. In keeping 
with the new situation brought on by changes in rural 
development, we should make timely and reasonable adjustments to 
the way we establish primary party organizations, actively 
explore an effective means to establish various village-level 
organizations as part of a complete network with party branches 
as the core, and promote the experience of "setting up 
organizations in accordance with the law, administering villages 
on the basis of established organizations, and exercising 
democratic management," so as to gradually institutionalize and 
standardize the work of various village-level organizations. 
  In closing, Hu Jintao said emphatically: We should earnestly 
strengthen and improve our leadership over primary organizations 
in rural areas. Both the party Central Committee and party 
committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels 
should devote themselves to building up primary organizations in 
rural areas. County (city) party committees should all the more 
carry out this task unremittingly and effectively. 
  Accompanying Hu Jintao during his inspection tour were Zeng 
Qinghong, director of the CPC Central Committee's General 
Office, and Zheng Keyang, deputy director of the CPC Central 
Committee's Central Policy Research Office.

<F P=106> [Third in series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F>
Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 
7160): "Foreigners Serving Sentences in Shanghai Prison"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 22 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--"I have 
traveled to many countries during my life and I am interested in 
local conditions and customs. An idea about Beijing opera face 
makeup crossed my mind and I began to create innovative Chinese 
Beijing opera makeups. I love `beauty creation.'" These were 
the feelings of British prisoner Rockland Campbell which he 
wrote about when participating in the 11th Beauty Creation 
Exhibition at Shanghai City Prison. The "Beijing opera facial 
makeup" he created featuring a high nose and blue eyes won 
second prize for its special characteristics. 
  Campbell could have received more art inspiration from the 
rich Chinese culture but he has to stay behind bars in China 
because of drug trafficking offences. Also serving prison terms 
with him in the Shanghai City Prison are British, American, 
German, Pakistani, and Burmese prisoners, 10 in all. They were 
punished by Chinese law either for drug trafficking or dealing 
in counterfeit money. 
  With the agreement of the prisoners, the prison authorities 
allowed this reporter to interview these "adventurers." Outside 
their cells, some were reading books, others were studying 
Chinese, and yet others were playing the electronic piano. They 
enjoy more freedom than Chinese prisoners. They do not have to 
wear a uniform, their hair styles are not restricted, they do 
not have to take part in physical labor, and they can go out 
[chu qi 0427 0637] at any time, if they want to. 
  Another British prisoner is Robert Davis. He told this 
reporter in bad Chinese that he was getting on very well there 
and that he was accustomed to the food and drink in prison. In 
the past he did not understand Chinese and he only began 
studying Chinese after he was sent to prison. There are written 
Chinese language materials as well as video and audio equipment. 
The instructor is very good and is ready to solve any problem. 
He bought a guitar and has taught himself to play. 
  The prison authorities said that the needs of foreign 
prisoners were basically met. For example, Mark Bebbo is a 
vegetarian. The prison provides him with food made of beans or 
eggs, butter, and fruit. The prison respects his religious 
beliefs but does not allow him to affect the religious 
activities of others. All foreign prisoners are required to 
study prison rules and discipline and Chinese law. 
  Robert Davis said that he did not understand Chinese law in 
the past but now he understands. This reporter asked him if he 
knew that the prison had been built by the British. He said: 
"I know but I do not thank them." 
  Rockland Campbell said Chinese prisons are not like foreign 
prisons, which are full of violence. He asked this reporter to 
tell his parents that he was getting on very well and hoped they 
would rest assured. 
  Foreign prisoners in China can meet with officials from 
their 
embassies in China once a month. The prison authorities said 
that so far they had not received any protest or complaint from 
foreign embassies or consulates about the lives of foreign 
prisoners in the prison. Robert Davis' parents came to see him 
in September 1992 to celebrate his birthday. The prison 
prepared a big cake for him. Davis' mother said: I have eaten 
many cakes but this one is the best. 
  The Shanghai City Prison provides the foreign prisoners with 
a copy of CHINA DAILY, a television set, and some foreign 
language books and magazines. These foreign prisoners have 
formed their own world in the prison but when there are sports 
competitions, they play tug-of-war with Chinese prisoners and 
form a "Chinese-foreign combined football team" against the 
prison's "officers' football team." Foreign prisoners who have 
performed well in serving their prison terms may have their 
terms shortened. A Pakistani prisoner named Harrid had his 
prison term reduced and consideration is also being given to 
reducing Mark Bebbo's sentence. 
  In the past, Shanghai City Prison has detained and 
transformed more than 350 foreign or stateless prisoners from 
some 30 countries. One of those in charge of the prison said 
that the prison reflects the dignity of Chinese law to foreign 
prisoners; on the other hand, it also gives expression to 
humanitarianism. China opens its gate to the world, not to 
crime.

<F P=106> [Fourth in series of reports entitled "Sights and Sounds of </F>
Chinese Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 
7160): "Female and Juvenile Prisoners"] 
  [Text] Beijing 23 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--On the 
platform a female inmate was reciting a poem entitled "A Lost 
Dream," pleading with her mother to forgive her past behavior. 
In the audience, tears ran down the faces of all the female 
inmates in their gray prison uniforms; were they repenting their 
pasts? Or were they expressing a shameful feeling toward their 
kin? 
  This was the scene during an art performance for the female 
inmates in Shandong's Weibei Prison, whose ages ranged from 18 
to 65. They were put here to accept transformation for crimes 
of theft, murder, embezzlement, and sex offenses. 
  "The way of the world is made dangerous by human desires, 
which make quite a few people go awry and ruin their lives." 
The female inmates are categorized into those desiring material 
goods, those desiring sex, and violent types. Most of them have 
committed crimes because of the stimulation of such factors as 
marriage, family, and love, and could only come to their senses 
when they were put into prison. However, they are then liable 
to sink into degradation. In transforming female inmates, it is 
precisely necessary to awaken their consciences, which have not 
been lost in their entirety, while guiding them to bear maternal 
and social responsibilities. 
  Liu Xiulian, who is 32 years old, was given a life sentence 
for murder because she was disappointed in a love affair 10 
years previously. When she was first put into prison, she was 
in utter despair. With the persuasion of a prison warder, she 
taught herself the skill of tailoring and became a garment 
designer in prison. Because of her outstanding performance, she 
was granted a commutation of her sentence to 16 years 
imprisonment. Later, she was again granted a commutation of her 
punishment and released. However, she was determined to train a 
few apprentices before leaving as an appreciation for the 
education by the prison authorities. 
  In her briefings, female ward deputy instructor Wei Huiying 
of Weibei Prison said that most female inmates are narrow-minded 
with very strong inferiority complexes and suicidal by 
inclination. The administration and education call for 
well-organized meticulousness to help substitute their negative, 
world-weary outlook on life characterized by "belittling 
themselves, lacking in self-respect, being self-piteous, and 
being self-destructive" with "self-respect, making efforts in 
self improvement, conducting oneself with dignity and 
independence." Over the past 10 years, there have been over 30 
attempted suicides but none of them have been successful. 
  Female sex offenses mostly result from a deviation in moral 
concepts and outlook on life and are regarded as the most 
difficult category for transformation. There is a "kingdom of 
women" inside Shanghai Municipal Prison in which "the worst 
women in Shanghai are imprisoned" as Shanghai residents put it. 
The prison authorities put them in different cells based on 
different categories to avoid overlapping effects; at the same 
time, they invite experts to give a series of lectures on sexual 
ethics, sexual sociology, and sexually transmitted diseases. 
They then conduct treatment using drugs and psychological 
techniques on those those who are abnormal both physiologically 
and psychologically with remarkable results. The rate of 
recidivism among those released after serving the full term of 
their sentences has been extremely low. 
  Compared with female inmates, juvenile delinquency has more 
profound social causes. The bulk of the more than 800 juveniles 
being held in Shandong Prison for Juvenile Delinquents are from 
the rural areas, especially the suburban areas, and 70 percent 
of them are school dropouts. The situation is pretty much the 
same in the Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents. 
  Such an unsound social atmosphere as the "theory that study 
is useless," and money- worship has spoiled the innocence and 
nature of rural teenagers. The major criminal offences committed 
by juvenile delinquents are theft and sex offences. 
  Regarding juvenile delinquents, "it is imperative to treat 
them as parents would when nursing their own children with 
infectious diseases, as doctors treat their patients, and as 
teachers treat their students when they make some mistakes." 
This is China's persistent policy for correcting juvenile 
delinquents. Each day in prisons or reform centers, juvenile 
delinquents take part for half the day in labor to learn some 
skills, such as repairing electric appliances, gardening, 
sewing, and cooking; the rest of the day is devoted to cultural 
studies, to make up for the lessons they should have learned at 
school. 
  Fine arts, such as music and painting, have become effective 
means in correcting juvenile delinquents in China. This 
reporter watched a rehearsal by the "Yuxin Performing Art 
Troupe" at Shandong Provincial Prison for Juvenile Delinquents 
and a performance of "Huichun Performing Art Troupe" at Shanghai 
Reform Center for Juvenile Delinquents. When one sees their 
concentration on music, one has to believe that the best of 
human culture has purified the soul that was once soiled. Wang 
Wenting, who has already served four years of her sentence for 
theft told this reporter that whenever she feels restless, she 
finds peace once again when she takes up her musical instrument. 
  Inside the iron gate of Shanghai Reform Center for Juvenile 
Delinquent stands a three-dimensional work of art, entitled: 
"Return." The Center named its cultural and technical school, 
art performance troupe, and paper "Hui Chun [return to spring]." 
All work involving education, persuasion, and salvation here is 
just for spring to return to those tender but distorted minds 
and help the lost lambs return to spring.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- China's courts and 
administrative authorities at various levels have pledged 
continued efforts to enforce the law to the letter and bring to 
justice violators of the intellectual property rights. 
  The achievements in the protection of legitimate rights and 
interests of the intellectual property right owners in China has 
attracted worldwide attention. 
  Statistics showed that from 1986 to the end of 1993, China's 
courts have handled a total of 3,505 preliminary intellectual 
property cases. Among them, 1,783 relate to patent matters, 
1,168 cases were filed for copyright infringements and 554 cases 
were lodged for trademark infringement. 
  Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual 
Property Society, said that as China's legal authorities stick 
to "fair and just" principles, China has moved closer to the 
international standards in the enforcement of intellectual 
property legislation. 
  Before July 1993 there was no special division in courts for 
handling intellectual property cases. Cases concerning 
intellectual property were tried by the economic division and 
the civil division respectively. 
  Since Beijing was the city in which the number of 
intellectual property disputes was the highest in the country, 
the Beijing Higher People's Court and the Intermediate People's 
Court set up their intellectual property divisions at the same 
time in July 1993, which was the first such division set up in 
Chinese courts. 
  Since the beginning of this year, the higher people's court 
and some of the intermediate people's courts in Shanghai 
Municipality, Guangdong Province, Fujian Province and Hainan 
Province have all set up intellectual property divisions. 
  Su Chi, presiding judge of the intellectual property 
division 
of the Beijing Intermediate People's Court, said that the cases 
accepted by the division covered all kinds of intellectual 
property cases. They include cases involving disputes over 
patents, trade marks, copyright (including the copyright in 
computer software), non-patented technology and various cases 
concerning the violation of the principle that honesty and 
credibility shall be observed and infringement of others' trade 
reputation and trade secrets. 
  Since the establishment of the division, it has accepted 217 
intellectual property cases, among which 21 were relating to 
foreign countries and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The total 
sum claimed in all these cases amounted to 156 million renminbi 
yuan. 
  Su Chi said that the intellectual property cases were all 
tried by collegiate panels in the division. 
  In cases of a complicated technical nature, such as cases 
involving patents and computer software disputes, expert 
assessors are invited to join the panel, Su said. 
  "However, in most cases, the panel consists of judges only," 
Su added. 
  When technical problems are involved in a case, explanation 
or evaluation made by at least two experts should be heard in 
court. 
  As Su Chi put it, all the intellectual property cases were 
heard in public. 
  He said that the division not only announces the time of 
court sessions in accordance with the procedures provided by the 
law, but also distribute ahead of schedule the time list of the 
court sessions to the public every month. 
  According to statistics, more than 3,000 people sat in court 
within more than half a year. 
  Su Chi pointed out that among the various intellectual 
property cases accepted by the division, infringement cases made 
up 80 percent of the total. 
  He said that the principle in dealing with infringement 
disputes was that once the infringing act is proved by evidence, 
the court should order the infringer to stop the infringing act 
and to compensate for all the damage that the rights-holder 
suffered because of the infringement according to the claim of 
the rights-holder and the provisions of the law. 
  The amount of the damages should be such as to properly 
compensate for the losses of the rights-holder and to stop any 
further infringement. 
  Su gave the example of the case in which the Beijing Vie de 
France Food Co. sued the Beijing Sunshine City Department Store. 
  He pointed out that it was the first case in China's 
intellectual property trials that the reasonable expenses for 
the investigation of the infringing act and of the litigation is 
deemed to be part of the economic loss and is borne by the 
infringer, as ordered in the judgment. 
  Su explained that the reason was that the "full 
compensation" 
principle of the Chinese civil law should be fully implemented 
so that the damage sustained by the infringed party can be fully 
compensated for and they can have less worries about the 
economic expense when they launch a legal struggle against the 
infringer. 
  Besides, Su added, the judgment also took into consideration 
the principles provided by the Uruguay Round Intellectual 
Property Agreement. 
  In the past 14 years, China has established a complete legal 
system for the protection of intellectual property rights. 
  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress 
enacted the laws governing trademark, patent, copyright and 
anti-unfair competition subsequently. 
  In 1992 and 1993, the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress adopted the revised Patent Law and Trademark 
Law, extending the protection of the Patent Law to such objects 
as chemical substances, pharmaceuticals, food, beverages and 
flavorings. 
  The patent rights became applicable to importation while 
process patents now became applicable to products. Furthermore, 
trademark protection has been extended to service marks and 
harsher penalties for trademark infringement acts have been 
imposed. 
  China has also been participating actively in the 
international cooperation in this field, fulfilling the 
international obligations and joining international 
organizations. 
  Dr. Arpad Bogsch, secretary-general of the World 
Intellectual 
Property Organization, highly praised China, saying: "In the 
history of intellectual property, China has made these 
achievements at a speed second to none."

  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The China Committee for 
Authenticating Environmentally Labeled Products was founded in 
Beijing today, signalling a period of substantial development in 
our country's "green industry." The committee's establishment 
will facilitate the improvement of the quality and reputation of 
environmentally labeled products, the development of domestic 
and foreign markets for such products, and the promotion of 
coordinated environmental and economic development. 
  Environmental labels, also known as ecological or green 
labels, are a kind of corroborative trademark which indicates 
that the products in question meet specific demands for 
environmental protection during the entire process, from the 
development and exploitation of raw and semifinished materials 
to production, utilization, and recovery or scrapping; that they 
pose no harm to the ecology or cause little pollution; and that 
they facilitate the regeneration and recovery of relevant 
resources. At present, more than 20 countries or regions in the 
world have adopted these labels or are drawing up plans for 
adopting them. 
  A leading environmental problem currently facing China is 
the 
serious wastage of resources and outmoded production technology. 
In light of its own national conditions and drawing on the 
experiences of foreign countries, China will first provide 
environmental label authentication services for environmentally 
harmful products which can be rendered significantly less 
noxious. Chief among them are products with low levels of 
toxicity and harm, energy- and water-saving products, products 
with low emissions, and recoverable, low-noise, and 
biodegradable products. Our country has prescribed and unveiled 
its first set of technological requirements for six 
environmentally labeled products. They apply to household 
refrigerators with low levels of chlorofluorocarbon [CFC], 
CFC-free aerosols (hair sprays and mousse), water-based paints, 
unleaded gasoline, recycled toilet paper, and silk products. 
  The China Committee for Authenticating Environmentally 
Labeled Products, which was established by the State 
Environmental Protection Bureau with the authorization of the 
State Technology Supervision Bureau, is the only third-party 
authentication agency which verifies various environmentally 
labeled products on behalf of the state. The committee, which 
is composed of specialists from environmental protection 
departments, economic management departments, scientific 
research institutes and academies, quality inspection 
departments, and relevant mass organizations, is headed by Xie 
Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau. 
  The design of the Chinese environmental label consists of 
green hills, blue water, the sun, and 10 rings, signifying that 
"all people have joined forces to protect the environment on 
which mankind depends for survival."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Xiao Hang (4562 5300): "Public Security </F>
Steps Up Operations Against Drug Trafficking"] 
  [Text] Stepped-up antidrug operations by public security 
organs across the country since early this year have resulted in 
solving more than 2,000 drug cases -- almost double the number 
in the same period last year -- and the seizure of more than 
2,000 kg of drugs. 
  Guided by identified drug-trafficking patterns, public 
security organs in southwest border provinces and regions, and 
those along the southeast coast -- such as Yunnan, Guangxi, 
Fujian, and Guangdong -- stepped up reconnaissance, and border 
and coastal interceptions, thereby solving cases, boosting the 
number of cases solved in the first quarter and achieving a 
greater rate of crime-busting than the same period last year. 
Yunnan solved 900 drug cases in the first quarter, seizing more 
than 700 kg of heroin; and solved a major drug case involving 
over 10 kg of heroin on each of six days from late March to 
early April. 
  Guangxi and Guangdong public security organs solved more 
than 
400 drug cases and arrested a number of drug traffickers from 
outside the borders in the first quarter. Aimed at stopping 
criminals from taking advantage of the increasing social 
intercourse between the two shores of the strait to traffic 
drugs, Fujian public security organs increased efforts at 
cracking these cases, solving 22 drug- trafficking cases in the 
first quarter, seizing close to 40 kg of drugs, and arresting 57 
suspects, some of them of Taiwan origin. 
  In their struggle against drugs, public security organs made 
a point of mobilizing and relying on the masses to launch a 
people's war against drugs. On 22 February, a peasant in 
Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, picked up a bundle of sugar 
cane on a road and found in it 51 g of heroin wrapped in a 
plastic bag. He reported this immediately to the public 
security organ, which investigated and followed the lead, 
thereby solving a major drug case. 
  The Ministry of Public Security recently issued notices 
commending public security organs for the brilliant results they 
have scored in the battle against drugs.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Show Constant Concern for the </F>
Well-Being of the Masses"] 
  [Text] Leading comrades of the central authorities are 
very much concerned about the well-being of the masses. Not 
long ago, they urged various localities and departments to 
conscientiously help a considerable number of people settle 
their problems in living. 
  Showing concern for the well-being of the masses is our 
party's fine tradition, and an important embodiment of our 
party's mass standpoint and mass line. Whether in the 
revolutionary war period or in the socialist construction 
period, our party has always considered the work of being 
concerned about the well-being of the masses as an important 
task. Reform is the cause of hundreds of millions of people. 
It is difficult to succeed in reform without the broad masses' 
wholehearted support and active participation, and the 
well-being of the masses is an important factor determining 
their enthusiasm for participating in reform. One of the main 
reasons our reform and opening up is supported by vast numbers 
of cadres and the broad masses is that the last decade or so was 
the period in which the people's living standard improved most 
rapidly and the masses gained the most benefit. In order to 
accomplish the reform work this year, to smoothly promote the 
establishment of socialist market economic system, and to 
realize the magnificent goals of struggle, we must be concerned 
about the well-being of the masses and take practical measures 
to solve some of the difficulties and problems encountered by 
the masses in their lives. 
  With the profound development of reform and opening up, the 
incomes of the broad masses are always on the rise and their 
living is improving constantly. According to the State 
Statistical Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, the 
monthly per capita living expenses and income of urban dwellers 
increased by 35.5 percent compared with the same period last 
year, whereas the per capita cash earnings of people in the 
countryside increased by 31.1 percent. After allowing for price 
increases, real growth rates were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent 
respectively. This indicates that reform and development 
embodies the broad masses' fundamental interests, and that our 
party and government are truly concerned about the well-being of 
the masses. Under the new situation of deepening reform and 
promoting development, and at a time when the people's living 
standard is constantly improving, some new conflicts and 
problems also have arisen. For example, owing to the combined 
effect of various factors, workers and staff of some enterprises 
that are in the red and have completely or partially suspended 
production, peasants in poverty-stricken areas, and some retired 
workers and staff have encountered some problems in their 
living. These are transient problems under the excellent 
situation, problems that have arisen in the process of 
development. The party Central Committee and the State Council 
attach great importance to these problems and already have taken 
a series of important measures, such as bringing down commodity 
prices and paying close attention to the "Shopping Basket" 
project. We firmly believe that under our party's leadership, 
we definitely can solve these transient difficulties and 
problems in an appropriate manner through deepening reform and 
developing our economy. 
  What should be affirmed is that most of our leading cadres 
take heed of and listen to the voice of the masses, are 
sympathetic to the hardships of the masses, and are making every 
effort to solve problems closely related to the interests of the 
masses, thus vigorously bringing into play the initiative of the 
masses so that every undertaking develops steadily. However, a 
small number of comrades are not so concerned about the 
hardships of the masses and cannot promptly take resolute 
measures against arbitrary price increases, disturbances of 
social order, and all those matters infringing on the interests 
of the masses. Some cadres think only of "their own 
achievements," and do not hesitate to take funds earmarked for 
the improvement of people's living and channel them into 
development projects, but they seldom bother about whether or 
not workers and staff can receive their pay on time, whether or 
not communications are convenient, to what extent do vegetable 
prices rise, whether or not peasants are overburdened, whether 
or not new phenomena of issuing IOUs exist, and how to reduce 
circulation links and increase peasants' earnings. Some other 
cadres even take advantage of their positions and abuse their 
power for personal gain, spending public funds for private 
enjoyment and overseas travel. All these infringe on the 
interests of the masses, and so cannot be allowed. To show our 
concern for the well-being of the masses, we definitely must 
improve the style of leadership in a conscientious manner, and 
must seriously deal with persons and practices in violation of 
the law and discipline in accordance with party discipline and 
the laws of our country. 
  We must make strenuous efforts to concern ourselves with the 
well-being of the masses. First, we must make in-depth studies 
and investigations, and must have a good grasp of the "Shopping 
Basket" and the "Rice Bag" projects and other issues closely 
related to the well-being of the masses. Second, we must do 
things in order of urgency, in light of the situation and our 
ability, and try our best to solve the people's problems. Money 
must be spent on some problems, so we must coordinate our 
financial resources to solve them. However, not much money is 
needed for some other problems, so we are required to carry 
forward the spirit of arduous struggle, rely on correct policy 
decisions, and arouse and rely on the enthusiasm of vast numbers 
of cadres and of the broad masses to solve those problems. For 
those problems which we are, for the time being, unable to 
handle, we still must patiently give clear explanations to the 
masses and must draw up feasible plans for solving them so as to 
gain the forgiveness of the masses. In brief, our leading 
cadres should be in a spirit of "caring for even the 
nonessentials" and should rack their brains to concern ourselves 
with and improve the well-being of the masses. This is our 
fellow Communists' basic task, which must never be forgotten. 
  Caring about the well-being of the masses is precisely to 
care about reform; caring about the well-being of the masses is 
precisely to care about development; and caring about the 
well-being of the masses is precisely to care about stability. 
If we concern ourselves with and conscientiously work for the 
interests of the masses, the broad masses certainly will take 
part in reform, promote development, and safeguard stability 
with extremely great enthusiasm, initiative, and innovation.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Shao Ling (6730 7227): "Have </F>
the Mainland Authorities Tightened Control Over Chinese-Foreign 
Joint Film Production?"] 
  [Text] It has been widely rumored lately in Hong Kong that 
the mainland authorities are planning to "tighten control over 
filmmaking" and reduce Chinese-foreign joint productions, which 
has led to much discussion in show business circles. On a 
public occasion the other day, when asked by the press to 
confirm the rumor, Cui Songming [1508 7313 2494], deputy chief 
of the culture and sports department of the Hong Kong Branch of 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, said: The mainland has not at any stage 
implemented a restrictive policy on filmmaking, but has merely 
reiterated the original rules that Hong Kong and Taiwan 
filmmakers must abide by the mainland's code of practice if they 
are to make films on the mainland and refrain from cheating the 
censor by submitting scripts that are different from those that 
are really to be used; and that all films must pass the censors 
of the Film Industry Administration [FIA] before being shown 
publicly or entered in international film festivals. But Cui 
Songming also admitted that the mainland should work out 
explicit regulations for film and television circles to go by, 
so as to avoid confusion. 
  It has been learned that the rumor about the mainland 
authorities "tightening control on filmmaking" first came from a 
report in Beijing's ZHONGGUO WENHUA BAO [CHINA CULTURE POST]. 
The paper quoted an official source as saying that, because 
some Hong Kong and Taiwan film companies had not honored the 
mainland's rules while making films on the mainland and caused 
many problems last year, the control on joint production will be 
tightened this year, including reducing the number of films 
produced in conjunction with overseas film companies and banning 
the establishment of joint-venture institutions and independent 
film production companies run by Chinese. According to the 
paper, the mainland authorities set the quantity of films to be 
produced nationwide this year at 150, of which the number of 
jointly produced ones will be kept under 30 (54 for last year), 
and the productions must pass censorship by the FIA before 
public showing. 
  Afterward, a number of newspapers and journals in Hong Kong 
published the "FIA Provisional Regulations on Strengthening the 
Joint Production of Films," which the mainland had not 
officially promulgated. They revealed the following 
information: The ceiling on jointly produced films set by the 
mainland authorities for this year is 30, with large, medium, 
and small film studios nationwide receiving quotas of three, 
two, or one. The FIA is demanding that each studio follow the 
principle of "mainly relying on ourselves" and that all projects 
of Chinese-foreign cooperation must be carried out by the 
procedure of "application," "listing," and "examination and 
approval" and must be subjected to the control of the Ministry 
of Radio, Film, and Television [MORFT]. The film authorities 
should establish a strict and tight contract management system. 
The shooting and last-phase production of a jointly produced 
film must be consistent with the approved script. Last-phase 
production must be conducted on the territory of China. The 
authority of final judgment on Chinese-foreign jointly produced 
films lies with the MORFT. Films that have not passed 
censorship may not be shown in the territory or be entered in 
any film festival or exhibition. In the production team of each 
Chinese-foreign jointly produced film, leading members from the 
mainland side must make up a certain percentage, below which the 
film shall be considered a foreign production with Chinese 
assistance (i.e., a film mainly produced by an overseas studio, 
assisted by a mainland studio). 
  Around this time, FIA Director Teng Jinxian made this 
remark: 
"Our principle has not changed. Films may take various artistic 
forms, but they must emphasize the theme." The "theme" refers 
to "patriotism, heroism, and collectivism." 
  The mainland authorities have always emphasized the 
ideological and didactic value of films, so it is not strange 
that they have specified the above-mentioned requirements. The 
recent ban on "Beijing Bastard [bei jing za zhong 0554 0079 7177 
4429]," "Blue Kite," "Soul of Painting [hua hun 3973 7609]," and 
"Farewell to My Concubine" and the ban on "Judou" and "Raise the 
Red Lantern" of two years ago probably were imposed because the 
authorities thought these films did not meet those requirements. 
  However, for various reasons, the box office returns for 
mainland films has been steadily deteriorating in recent years, 
which has spurred the interest of film studios in joining hands 
with film companies outside China, with a view to improving 
their performance at the box office. In 1982, China had only 
two Chinese-foreign jointly produced films. The number rose to 
six in 1986 and then jumped ahead by a large margin to over 30 
in 1992. In 1993, the number of jointly produced films reached 
54. Joint production has become very popular because studios 
have no financial risks. They have a saying: "We spend no 
money during production; we make money after production -- even 
if we do not make money, at least we do not lose money ." 
  However, because the production process and guiding ideology 
of Hong Kong films are very different from mainland films, many 
problems have emerged. For example, the mainland attaches great 
importance to the script, and a director must strictly follow 
the censored script, while Hong Kong directors and producers do 
not pay much attention to the script and often revise it as they 
move on in the process of shooting, changing the content of the 
completed production beyond recognition. Another example is 
that nudity and sex scenes may not appear in a mainland film, 
but Hong Kong films often use them as a "commercial factor" to 
improve box office returns. Hence, there are two version of 
each film, a chaste one which is handed in to the mainland 
censors and another with additional sequences which will be 
shown in Hong Kong and overseas. "Li Lianying the Eunuch" and 
"Temptation of a Monk" belong in this category. Another film, 
"Dragon Out of the Sea [jiao long chu hai 5754 7893 0427 3189]," 
even contained additional anti-communist lines when shown 
abroad. This is where the criticism of "not abiding by the 
mainland regulations" came from. 
  "To Live," a Chinese-foreign jointly produced film which has 
recently become a topic of discussion, was also entered in the 
Cannes Film Festival without being censored by the mainland 
authorities, thus causing dispute between the two sides.

  [Text] Hefei, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Five provinces in central 
and east China have made gratifying headway in controlling and 
treating malaria, the fever conveyed by mosquitoes, through 
20-year efforts. 
  According to a recent meeting in Chuzhou city, Anhui 
Province, the incidence of malaria in Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, 
Anhui and Hubei provinces has dropped greatly, and 93 percent of 
the people in malaria-prevalent areas are basically free from 
the threat of the disease. 
  Malaria, a symbol of poverty, was rampant in those five 
provinces. For centuries it affected the health of millions of 
people. 
  According to surveys, the number of malaria cases reached 
21.98 million in 473 counties and cities in these five provinces 
in 1970, and 21.74 million in 1971, accounting for at least 90 
percent of China's total of malaria cases. 
  Anhui was worst-hit by the disease and had 11.52 million 
cases in 1970. 
  Its Fuyang and Suxian prefectures had an incidence as high 
as 
50 percent in those days. 
  As many people were ill, some factories had to close down 
and 
crops were left in the fields unharvested due to shortage of 
labor forces. 
  With approval of the State Council in 1974, Jiangsu, Henan, 
Shandong, Hubei and Anhui provinces began to cooperate in 
controlling and treating malaria. 
  While positively treating malaria cases, these areas have 
strengthened studies for the prevention and treatment of the 
disease and sent professors, experts and scientific workers to 
the grass-root units to tackle key technical problems. 
  They have also trained 400,000 specialists in malaria 
treatment and control. 
  As a result, the incidence of the disease in the five 
provinces reduced to 1.078 million in 1984 and 10,395 last year. 
Now, their incidence rate accounts for 17.75 percent of the 
country's total. 
  A survey shows that 316 counties, accounting for more than 
70 
percent of the total number of the cases for the five provinces, 
have reached the government-set standard of being basically free 
from malaria. 
  As early as 1988, east China's Shandong Province took the 
lead in the country in eliminating this scourge. 
  Last year saw only 24 counties and cities have an incidence 
rate of one per ten thousand, compared with 473 counties and 
cities in 1973. 
  To control the disease, Jiangsu, Henan and Anhui provinces 
have enhanced the treatment and study of malaria and eliminated 
the sources of mosquitoes. 
  As a result, no malignant malaria case has been reported in 
Jiangsu and Henan provinces for six years and in Anhui Province 
for three years. 
  The experience in making joint efforts to control and treat 
the disease has been highly commended by the World Health 
Organization (WHO), which organized China, Thailand, Myanmar 
[Burma], Vietnam and Laos to jointly treat and prevent the 
disease in the border areas last year.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- The China World Trade 
Center, a widely-known Sino-foreign joint venture in China, 
presented 380,000 yuan (about 43,700 U.S. dollars) to the "Hope 
Project" here today. 
  The donation will be used to build a primary school in 
Qidong 
county of central China's Hunan Province and help Hunan's 600 
school drop-outs to return to school. 
  The Hope Project, sponsored by the China Youth Development 
Foundation (CYDF) in 1989, is aimed to help school drop-outs in 
China's poverty-stricken areas to return to school. 
  It has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from 
home and abroad during the past five years and helped over 
540,000 drop- outs to get back in the classroom. In addition, 
it has helped to set up more than 200 "hope primary schools" all 
over the country. 
  According to an official from the CYDF, this year many 
domestic industrial and commercial enterprises have contributed 
money to the hope project. A number of hotels and some 
enterprises from service trades in Beijing have organized 
donations. 
  "This shows the industrial and commercial enterprises' 
concern for the school drop-outs and the development of the 
country's primary education," said the official. 
  However, donations from domestic industrial and commercial 
enterprises are still less than two percent of the total 
donations the hope project has received, said the official. He 
called for more support to be given to the project by domestic 
enterprises.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Education in Patriotism Must Start </F>
From Childhood"] 
  [Text] In Chinese history, patriotism has always been a 
great banner to mobilize and inspire the people to unite and 
strive as well as a common spiritual pillar among people of all 
nationalities. The on-the-spot meeting on education in 
patriotism in primary and secondary schools in Shanghai jointly 
convoked by the Central Propaganda Department, the State 
Education Commission, the Ministry of Radio, Film and 
Television, the Ministry of Culture, and the Communist Youth 
League Central Committee will give a powerful thrust to and be a 
powerful promotion of unfolding education in patriotism in 
primary and secondary schools in depth and breadth in a 
persistent manner. 
  Education in patriotism is basic engineering for improving 
the quality of the entire nation. The focus of this basic 
engineering is the broad masses of teenagers. The population of 
primary and secondary pupils on campus approaches 175 million 
across China; they are a generation that straddles the 20th and 
21st centuries, and will be the main force in building socialist 
modernization in China in the 21st century. The histories of 
various countries teach us that only when the younger generation 
has a good knowledge of the history of its own country and 
nation, and shapes such knowledge into a strong patriotic 
awareness, while converting its will to render service to the 
country into conscious actions to serve the motherland, will it 
be possible for it to become a generation that can accomplish a 
lot. When we grasp firmly the education in patriotism among 
primary and secondary school pupils, the entire society will be 
affected, and the main theme of patriotism will be sharper and 
more conspicuous, while the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization will mount a new level. In a nutshell, putting 
education in patriotism in primary and secondary schools in an 
important place on the agenda, while earnestly implementing it, 
is a mission history has bestowed on us. 
  Our party and government leaders attach great importance to 
the education in patriotism among primary and secondary school 
pupils. Party and government leaders, including Jiang Zemin, 
have repeatedly stressed that it is imperative to make the 
concepts of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism the "theme 
of the entire society." Party and government leading departments 
at all levels have created many good methods, which are vivid 
and lively, of conducting education in patriotism among the 
broad masses of teenagers, and accumulated many fresh 
experiences. A very successful example is precisely the use of 
fine films and television movies to unfold education in 
patriotism in primary and secondary schools across China. This 
activity has aroused a warm response from the whole society, 
with very good effects. 
  However, we must also see that the gap between our work and 
the requirements of the times, as well as the rich contents of 
patriotism, is still great. For instance, a small number of 
departments and units do no more than pay lip service, writing 
documents on conducting education in patriotism among teenagers, 
rather than taking practical measures; some of them lack 
understanding of teenagers' actual conditions, and fail to study 
the characteristics of education in patriotism during the new 
period; the education lacks essence, and is also pointless. In 
other departments and units, the forms of education are 
monotonous and rigid, always being the same thing and with no 
differences in level. Much work and joint action in various 
social aspects are called for to grasp and take care of the 
matter with common efforts to further conduct education in 
patriotism in depth and breadth in a persistent way. 
  China is a country with a long history and a brilliant 
culture, and one that is advancing toward modernization with 
full vitality. To conduct education in patriotism among primary 
and secondary pupils, it is precisely necessary to bring forth 
the fine traditions of patriotism, and help this generation of 
teenagers to understand the outstanding contributions our 
ancestors made to the civilization of mankind and the tremendous 
and profound changes in all aspects in China since reform and 
opening up, thus augmenting their pride in the nation. From 
history to reality, there are extremely rich potential resources 
for conducting education in patriotism in various arenas of 
social life. Better effects will be achieved if we link the 
fine traditions of the Chinese nation to the reality of reform 
and opening up. 
  Patriotism reflects people's rational understanding of the 
relations between the individual and the motherland; at the same 
time, it contains people's lofty feelings for the motherland. 
It is a kind of consciousness and spirit embodied in conscious 
actions as well as every single specific matter. To augment 
education in patriotism, it is precisely necessary to grasp the 
art of education. It is necessary to work hard at such links as 
seeing the truth, knowing the situation, stirring up passion, 
and cultivation to stimulate the broad masses of teenagers' 
devotion to "having knowledge of, cherishing and building the 
Chinese nation." It is necessary to adopt various methods and 
ways as well as diversified propaganda vehicles, and to be 
familiar with the forms the masses love to hear and see, while 
infiltrating all aspects of teenagers' study, labor, life, and 
amusement with the education in patriotism. The school is an 
important place in which to conduct education in patriotism 
among teenagers. That being the case, the education in 
patriotism must run through the whole course of teaching and 
education from kindergarten through college, with institutions 
set and mechanisms formed. It is imperative to give full play 
to the roles of the forms teenagers love to hear and see, such 
as films and television, drama, books and magazines, music, 
drawing, and calligraphy, so that patriotism may strike root 
among teenagers. In addition, it is necessary to be good at 
giving play to the educational role of various kinds of museums, 
memorial halls, historical remains and ruins, as well as famous 
mountains and rivers. 
  Education in patriotism is systems engineering, as well as a 
long-term strategic task. It is necessary to persist in it and 
to continuously blaze new trails so that it may be unfolded in 
greater depth and breadth. Let us hold aloft the banner of 
patriotism, and strive for the magnificent cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics.

  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- The Information Bureau 
of the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda Department sponsored a 
national forum of periodicals for professional journalists at 
NANFANG RIBAO in Guangzhou 8-10 May. The purpose of the forum 
was to study ways to improve the management of journals in 
conjunction with the implementation of the national propaganda 
and ideological work conference guidelines, to bring into full 
play the press' role in correct guidance of public opinion, and 
to prompt the media to more effectively carry out the task of 
"guiding the people with correct public opinion." 
  The forum was attended by officials from RENMIN RIBAO'S 
XINWEN ZHANXIAN [JOURNALISTIC FRONT], XINHUA NEWS AGENCY's 
ZHONGGUO JIZHE [CHINESE JOURNALISTS], and the Central Television 
Station's JIANSHI YANJIU [TELEVISION STUDY]; as well as from 15 
central and local journalistic periodicals and research 
institutes in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hubei, Sichuan, 
Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang. Xu Xinhua, director of the 
Information Bureau, chaired and spoke at the forum. 
  Along with the rapid development of the journalistic 
undertaking since reform and opening up, the number of 
journalistic periodicals in publication has increased to more 
than 30, forming an important component of the journalistic 
undertaking. They have played a significant role and achieved 
fruitful results in promoting theoretical research of 
journalism, pressing for journalistic reform, and enhancing 
journalists' political and professional qualities. In the light 
of the realities of management, the forum's participants 
analyzed in depth the current condition of journalistic 
periodicals, exchanged experiences in managing the journals 
under new circumstances, and further clarified the orientation 
in management. They believed that along with the progress in 
reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive, it is 
necessary for the journals to bring into full play their role in 
correct guidance by studying journalistic theories, summarizing 
journalist work experiences, identifying practical problems, and 
enhancing the overall quality of journalists. 
  The forum participants deemed the strengthening of guidance 
with ideology and theory as the core issue of the role of 
journals in correctly guiding public opinion. How should the 
media guide people with correct public opinion in the great 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics? How 
should the media cope with the requirements for developing a 
socialist market economy in the course of establishing such a 
structure? How should the media keep abreast of the demand for 
building socialist spiritual civilization? To find the answers 
to these questions, journalistic periodicals should persist in 
taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as the guide and adhere to the party's 
basic line in actively guiding journalists to study new 
circumstances, to summarize new experiences, and to solve new 
problems. They should uphold the principle of party spirit and 
the party's basic principles in going all out to conduct the 
study of journalistic theories, promoting journalistic reform, 
and improving the quality of press publicity. They should 
enhance their sense of responsibility and awareness of the 
overall interests, of reform and opening up, and of 
investigations and study to ensure good reviewing and guidance 
work through press publicity. Efforts should be made to publish 
journals having more theoretical, salient, relevant, and 
creative features. 
  The forum participants deemed the enhancement of the overall 
quality of journalists as one of the journals' major tasks. 
Efforts should be made to improve journalists' ethical 
standards; and to encourage them to mingle with the masses, to 
go deep into reality, to work hard, honestly, and with 
self-discipline, and to conscientiously resist "compensated 
journalism" and other unhealthy practices. It is necessary to 
encourage the journalistic circles to turn out outstanding works 
and train talented personnel for producing special columns, 
reporters, editors, and commentators well known among readers. 
It is also necessary to bring into play the journals' functions 
as the "mobile schools of journalism" in helping journalists 
improve their political and professional qualities and update 
their knowledge and concepts. 
  The forum participants urged journalistic periodicals to 
adhere to their publication objective, and work hard to publish 
journals with distinctive features. While improving operations 
and management, they should persist in putting social benefits 
first, and strive to win support from journalists and to combine 
social with economic benefits. Leaders of the relevant 
departments and journalistic units should regard improved 
management of journals as an important measure for strengthening 
theoretical study of journalism and for improving journalists' 
quality, and should attach importance to and support journals' 
work. 
  The forum participants also reached a common understanding 
on 
increasing contacts and coordination to pool the efforts of all.

  [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- The Muslim students of 
the Central University of Nationalities received a free treat of 
roast mutton from the university -- a traditional way to 
celebrate their Corban Festival. 
  The State Commission for Minority Nationalities' Affairs 
held 
a get-together today for Beijing Muslims, at which minorities' 
songs and dances were performed by the Central Nationalities

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zhang Shulin (1728 2579 2651) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Xu Jinpeng (1776 6855 7720)] 
  [Text] Haikou, 17 May (XINHUA) -- At the Haikou annual 
meeting of the China Economic Restructuring Research Society 
which opened today, Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau, state councilor, and minister in 
charge of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, 
stressed: China's economic reform has entered the stage in which 
a completely new system should be built. Only by arming our 
minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and by studying the theory in depth 
can we adhere to the correct course of reform, opening up, and 
modernization; can we speed up the process of building a new 
system; and can we take advantage of the current opportunity to 
enable the economy to develop in a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
manner. 
  Li Tieying said: Since the 14th CPC National Congress, 
especially since the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee made the decision on some problems concerning 
building a socialist market economic system, reform of China's 
economic system, figuratively speaking, has shifted from 
dismantling the old house to building a new mansion. The 
thoroughgoing changes in the entire process of reform have been 
demonstrated in all major spheres of reform-- microeconomic 
reform has begun to shift from readjusting the policy of 
reducing enterprises' tax payment and allowing them to retain a 
bigger share of profits to building a complete new system; price 
reform has begun to shift from decontrolling commodity prices to 
letting prices of production factors be decided by the market; 
building of the market system has begun to shift from developing 
markets of key commodities to developing selective markets of 
production factors; macroeconomic regulation and control has 
begun to shift from mainly relying on administrative means to 
mainly relying on economic, legal, and necessary administrative 
means, and has entered an in-depth reform stage of straightening 
out the basic economic relationships (including relationships 
between the state and enterprises and between the central and 
local authorities). Judging from both the scope and depth of 
reform, this year's reform measures are unprecedented. 
Currently, the State Council and all localities are endeavoring 
to transform state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms and 
to experiment with building a modern enterprise system. 
Implementation of the macroeconomic measures for reforming the 
financial, taxation, foreign exchange systems has been smooth in 
general -- this shows that China has made an important step 
toward building a socialist market economic system. 
  Li Tieying pointed out: There are a number of problems 
pending for solution in the economic life and reform of the 
economic system. Basically speaking, these problems are related 
to the failure to shift fundamentally the operating mechanisms 
of enterprises; to the lack of intensity to reform the system of 
property rights and to set up a new enterprise system; and to 
the slow progress in changing government functions in economic 
management and in establishing a social security system. He 
said: In a sense, the difficult and crucial spots in economic 
development are essentially the focal points of reform. To 
seize the opportunity for development means to seize the 
opportunity to reform. Reform aims to solve various structural 
defects impeding economic growth and, therefore, to liberate and 
expand productivity. Herein lies the profound significance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remark that "we should undertake reforms 
as the second Chinese revolution." 
  Li Tieying said: The experiences of reform and opening up 
over the past 15 years, to put in a nutshell, are: under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, we have charted a 
course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In 
the past 15 years, while establishing a new socialist market 
economic structure, we have also set up a new theoretical 
system, which is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Deng Xiaoping's concept 
of economic affairs is a major component of his theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theses on economic development, economic reform, and 
stability being the prerequisite for development and reform are 
the theoretical foundations and action guidelines in promoting 
reform and the modernization drive; it is a farsighted summation 
of the practical experiences in continually deepening reforms. 
Comrades in the economic restructuring front are duty bound to 
arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic 
affairs and to use it to guide practical work of reform as this 
is an important guarantee for smoothly promoting reform. The 
greatness of Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs lies in 
its practicality. We must strive to translate this scientific 
concept into practical work. This is the fundamental objective 
of studying and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic 
affairs. 
  In the light of realities in the current economic reform and 
economic development, Li Tieying put forth five tasks: 
Straightening out the relationship of state-owned enterprises' 
property rights and pushing for the establishment of a modern 
enterprise in a down-to-earth manner; cultivating the market 
system and developing intermediate organizations of market in 
keeping with the needs of economic development; effectively 
overcoming major ups and downs in economic development and 
achieving a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
national economy; stabilizing grain and cotton production, 
harnessing farmers' enthusiasm, and properly resettling surplus 
rural laborers; and correctly handling the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability under the new situation. He 
urged comrades in the economic restructuring front to heighten 
their spirits, emancipate their minds, and guided by Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's concept of economic affairs, go deep into 
realities to conduct investigations, obtain firsthand 
information, work out measures, and make fresh contributions to 
the establishment of the new system.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Finance Minister Liu Zhongli by </F>
staff reporter Dong Ruisheng (5516 3843 3932); date, place not 
given: "Finance Minister Liu Zhongli Speaks on Several Hot 
Points in Implementation of the New Tax System" --first 
paragraph is editor's note] 
  [Text] The new tax system has been operating for three 
months. What is the effect? What new conflicts have we met 
with in the process? Have such aspects as production, 
circulation, financial revenues, and commodity prices been 
adversely affected? This reporter invited Finance Minister Liu 
Zhongli to learn his views on these hot issues about which 
people are concerned. 
<H5>  The Tax Reform Has Not Brought About Drastic Fluctuations or </H5>
Huge Increases in Commodity Prices 
  Commodity price increases were widespread last winter and 
this spring, and the masses had strong grievances against this 
situation. Many people suspected that it had something to do 
with the introduction of the new tax system. So what is the 
truth? 
  Liu Zhongli explained: We set great store by mass opinion, 
and have been tracking and looking into their views ever since 
the introduction of the new tax system. Now I can say for 
certain that the tax reform has not brought about drastic 
fluctuations or huge increases in commodity prices. Last year, 
prior to the tax reform, every tonne of rolled steel was priced 
over 4,000 yuan, but since the introduction of the new tax 
system this year, the price of rolled steel not only has not 
risen, but has dropped a bit, showing that the law of supply and 
demand is functioning. Some people said that the levy of 
consumption tax led to increased prices for refrigerators, color 
television sets, and other household electrical appliances, but 
this too is groundless. At present, the scope of the 
consumption tax levy does not cover household electrical 
appliances. The key targets of the levy can be divided into 
five major categories: 1) Special consumer goods -- such as 
cigarettes, liquor, and firecrackers and fireworks -- excessive 
consumption of which will jeopardize people's health, the social 
order, and the ecological environment; 2) Luxuries and non-daily 
necessities, such as gold, jewelry, jade, and cosmetics; 3) High 
energy-consumption and high-grade consumer goods, such as 
automobiles and motorcycles; 4) Petroleum-related goods that 
cannot be regenerated, such as gasoline and diesel fuel; and 5) 
Consumer goods with certain financial significance, such as car 
tires and products for skin and hair protection. Compared with 
the former tax system, there is basically no change in taxable 
consumer goods' overall level of tax burden, even if the 
consumption tax is levied on these products, and most of the tax 
items are basically at the original level of burden. The levy of 
the consumption tax will not affect the level of commodity 
prices. 
  People objected to increased vegetable prices, with some 
saying they were caused by the tax reform, but Liu Zhongli 
considered such remarks as not conforming to the reality. He 
said: At present, vegetables are still levied at the original 
retail tax rate. The main reasons accounting for price rises in 
vegetables are: 1) Vegetable plots in the suburbs of many 
cities have been transformed into real estate and economic 
development zones, and new vegetable plots must be developed in 
the outer suburbs, thus incurring greater cost; 2) Some 
wholesalers and retailers running vegetable businesses have 
seized the opportunity of the introduction of the reform to 
raise prices, fix prices in excess of those authorized, and ask 
exorbitant prices, thus disturbing normal pricing order in the 
market and driving up the level of commodity prices; and 3) 
Vegetable prices also depend on whether it is off or peak 
season, and on the law of value. 
  Comrade Liu Zhongli said: To understand the level of 
commodity prices, we must uphold the standpoint of seeking truth 
from facts and of the market economy. To solve this problem, 
the basic method is to handle things according to law and to 
increase effective supplies to the market. The State Council 
meeting on the "Shopping Basket" project will have a positive 
meaning in stabilizing non-staple food prices. 
  After citing numerous facts, Liu Zhongli pointed out with 
emphasis: The root cause of increases in the general level of 
commodity prices is excessive investment and granting of loans, 
excessive currency issuance, and the exceedingly rapid growth of 
consumption funds. In the final analysis, price increases are 
caused by the double pushing of the forces of demand -- for 
consumption and for investment. The party Central Committee and 
the State Council attach great importance to this problem, and 
have already decided, on the one hand, to carry out massive 
inspections of commodity prices and the scale of investment for 
capital construction and to strengthen and improve macroscopic 
regulation; and on the other, to carry out the "Shopping Basket" 
project and increase effective supplies to society by vigorously 
developing agriculture. We are going to solve the problem and 
stabilize commodity prices by taking the measures in these two 
respects. The tax reform is correct and cannot be doubted, and 
we should continue to progress on this basis. 
<H5>  The Tax Reform Has Not Adversely Affected Production, </H5>
Circulation, and Financial Revenues 
  Liu Zhongli said: The new tax system has operated for three 
months, and the overall situation is normal. We have basically 
achieved steady transition without causing any great problems. 
All walks of life in society and most enterprises have 
responded calmly to the introduction of the new tax system and 
the changes in tax burdens. The introduction of the new tax 
system has not increased the tax burden of foreign businessmen 
investing in China, thus dispelling their doubts. Industrial 
production is still developing rapidly. According to statistics 
compiled by the State Statistical Bureau, from January to 
February, industrial enterprises at and above the county level 
throughout the country completed 541.9 billion yuan worth of 
output value, up 18.16 percent over the same period last year. 
As far as financial revenues are concerned, a trend of huge 
growth is still shown. By the end of February, the national 
domestic financial revenues (excluding debts) increased 32.1 
percent over the same period last year, including 41.405 billion 
yuan of industrial and commercial tax revenues, which registered 
an increase of 32.3 percent over the same period last year. As 
for the general value-added tax [VAT], as a shared tax, a total 
of 21.503 billion yuan was turned over to treasuries from 
January to February, and 71.1 percent and 28.9 percent of the 
sum was turned to the central and local treasuries, 
respectively, which was basically close to the requirements of 
the tax-sharing system. As proved by practice over the past 
three months, the tax reform package is a proper one, and the 
positive results achieved by the reform have strengthened our 
confidence and determination in scoring a sure victory in the 
tax reform. 
  Compared With the Former Tax System, the New VAT 
Merely Makes Changes in the Method of Tax Calculation, But It 
Does Not Increase the Overall Tax Burden of Commodities 
  The VAT, in essence, is a levy on the amount of added value. 
So what is the most fundamental difference between the 
post-reform VAT and that in the former tax system? 
  Liu Zhongli said: Our country started levying the VAT on an 
experimental basis in 1979, and there was no unified standard of 
tax burden; the scope of the levy was not wide; the product tax 
levied on the links of industrial production and coexisted with 
and overlapped the VAT; the business tax was levied on commodity 
circulation link, whereas the unified industrial and commercial 
tax was levied on enterprises linked to foreign investment; and 
there was no unified taxation policy. Moreover, restricted by 
the scope of the levy, it was difficult to implement a tax 
deduction system in which invoices clearly indicating the amount 
of tax payment are produced. Consequently, even though taxes 
were reduced or remitted in a certain link, taxes still were 
deducted in the following link, thus making it impossible for 
the VAT to bring its intrinsic mechanism of control into play. 
  Liu Zhongli said that the implementation of the new VAT 
embodied the characteristics of being standardized, close-knit, 
and convenient: First, the scope of the levy is widened, that 
is, the links of production, import, wholesaling and retailing 
businesses, and processing all are included in the scope of the 
VAT levy. Second, the scope of taxpayers is widened, that is, 
all units and individuals selling goods and offering labor 
services for processing and repairs inside the PRC and importing 
goods into the territory are included. Third, tax rates are 
combined and simplified, that is, the tax structure has only two 
grades of tax rates; the basic tax rate is 17 percent, while the 
low tax rate is 13 percent. In addition, a zero tax rate is 
levied on exports, whereas a six percent tax rate is levied on 
small taxpayers who do not have sound accounting and auditing 
practices. Fourth, a VAT deduction system is implemented in 
which invoices are produced that clearly indicate the amount of 
tax payment. 
  At present, some people regard the 17 percent of extra-price 
tax [jia wai shui 0116 1120 4451] as a tax levied on top of the 
selling price. Liu Zhongli said that this practice was 
certainly incorrect. The so-called in-price tax [jia nei shui 
0116 0355 4451] refers to the fact that prior to the reform, the 
amount of VAT was included in selling prices, and the tax rates 
were calculated according to the tax-inclusive prices; whereas 
the so-called extra-price tax refers to the fact that the rates 
of post-reform VAT are calculated according to the prices that 
do not include VAT, and the prices and the amount of VAT are 
separately stated. However, when commodities are sold in the 
retailing link, the tax amount is still included in the prices, 
rather than separately stated. Compared with the former tax 
system, the new VAT merely makes changes in the method of tax 
calculation, but it does not increase the overall tax burden of 
commodities. Hence, the selling prices of commodities should 
not be raised. 
  Using special invoices to implement the VAT can close the 
loophole of loss of state taxes. However, for small taxpayers 
who do not have sound accounting and auditing practices, the 
marketing of their products will be affected, to a certain 
extent, because they are not included in this taxation category, 
which will be unfavorable to the production, operation, and 
development of small enterprises. So, how can we solve this 
problem? 
  Liu Zhongli said: This problem really exists and we have 
taken note of it. To affect the production and operation of 
these enterprises, we have already taken a number of measures. 
However, the fundamental way is still to help these small 
enterprises take the path of sound accounting and auditing so as 
to promote and strengthen the VAT administration. 
  Implementation of the land VAT helps standardize the order 
of 
real estate transactions, rationally regulate value-added land 
gains, and keep land and apartment speculation in check. It is 
a good thing. However, some foreign businessmen have strongly 
objected to it, so is it unfavorable to foreign investment in 
our country's real estate industry? 
  Liu Zhongli pointed out: Since 1987, our country has been 
reforming the system of land use and has allowed profit-making 
transfers of land use rights. Over the past two years, the real 
estate industry has developed very rapidly and the real estate 
market has begun to take shape. At the same time, however, some 
problems also have arisen. For example, land allotment crazes 
arose in some localities, and some units and individuals took 
the opportunity to speculate on plots of land and unbuilt 
apartments so that the state incurred great losses in land 
assets gains, whereas certain units and individuals reaped 
staggering profits, thus affecting the normal operation of the 
state's overall macroscopic regulation. To reverse this 
situation, we began to levy the land VAT, the purpose of which 
is to encourage normal real estate development and management, 
curb real estate speculation, and standardize the order of real 
estate transactions. The State Council already has promulgated 
regulations, stipulating that the land VAT must be levied, the 
unified tax system must be enforced throughout the country, and 
no locality is allowed to work out its own policy. Some 
reasonable suggestions will be considered when drawing up the 
detailed rules and regulations for implementation. 
  There is no tax reduction or exemption in the VAT, but for 
those enterprises and professions which really have run into 
difficulties and are supported the state -- such as welfare 
enterprises set up by the disabled and the coal industry -- how 
can their tax burden be settled and lightened? 
  Li Zhongli said: Even the VAT rate of these enterprises and 
professions cannot be altered because the following links will 
have to bear a heavier tax burden if theirs are lightened. So 
what should we do? We can take the method of levying the tax 
first, before returning the proceeds to them. In addition, we 
can adjust our financial policy to support the development of 
these enterprises and professions. 
<H5>  Overall, the Tax Reform Will Not Increase Enterprises' Tax </H5>
Burden 
  After reforming enterprise income tax and levying the new 
VAT, some enterprises complained that they had to bear a heavier 
tax burden, so what actually has been achieved by the three 
months' practice? 
  As far as the turnover tax reform is concerned, enterprises 
are most affected by the VAT reform. Since VAT is an 
extra-price levy and the sytem of tax deduction by producing 
invoices is implemented, such taxes paid by enterprises are the 
remaining sum of the taxable amount of goods sold minus the 
taxable amount of goods bought, and is transferred to buyers 
through sales. Hence, the VAT will not increase enterprises' 
tax burden. 
  Liu Zhongli said: The three months' practice of the new tax 
reform also proves that the tax burden of most enterprises is 
the same as before, or even slightly less than previously, and 
that only a minority of enterprises are affected by the reform, 
and the effect is next to nothing. Such being the case, why 
have some people said that they shoulder a heavier tax burden? 
  Liu Zhongli said: One of the situations is that in the past 
several years, the task of tax levies was not strictly 
fulfilled, and various localities reduced or exempted many 
taxes, so when we started levying the new VAT at every level and 
closed all the loopholes, some people perhaps felt that their 
tax burden was heavier than before. Another situation is due to 
a broader tax base. For example, suppose the tax rate is three 
percent and the pre-reform annual turnover was 1 million yuan, 
then 30,000 yuan of tax should be paid, but when the post-reform 
annual turnover reaches 1.3 million yuan, then 36,000 yuan of 
tax should be paid. Such a case cannot be considered an 
increase in the tax rate and the tax burden, but is due to a 
broader tax base brought about by a larger turnover. 
  In addition, the reform of enterprise income tax has unified 
income taxes paid by all types of enterprises, which are all 
subject to a 33 percent proportional tax rate. Moreover, the 
regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises has been abolished, 
and such enterprises are exempt from paying "two funds" ["liang 
jin" 0357 6855 refers to construction fees and budget adjustment 
funds for key energy and communication projects]. For 
enterprises having a low profit level, a two-grade proportional 
tax rate, that is, 27 percent and 18 percent, has been set. In 
this way, most enterprises have a lighter income tax burden than 
before.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Yun (7115 5366)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- Under the State 
Council's arrangements, the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank 
of China, and other relevant departments have conducted a study 
on solving the problem of circulating fund shortages resulting 
from defaults of goods payments and came up with a decision to 
launch a clearance exercise among major industries and trades in 
the northeast to gain experience needed for a nationwide 
campaign. 
  Speaking at a work meeting on straightening out the problem 
of circulating fund shortages among major industries and trades 
in the northeastern region here today, Yang Changji, vice 
minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, 
said: Leading comrades in both the party's Central Committee 
and the State Council have been constantly attaching importance 
to reform and development of state-owned enterprises. For 
years, although conditions of state-owned enterprises have 
improved following the introduction of various state policies 
and measures, certain problems remained. Currently, due to the 
problems of circulating fund shortages, sluggish products sales, 
and overstocks experienced by some state-owned industrial 
enterprises, defaults of goods payments among enterprises have 
become relatively serious. 
  Yang Changji said: The causes leading to the current mutual 
indebtedness among enterprises have both similarities to and 
differences from those of the past. The similarities involve 
investments in fixed assets, fund shortages, behind-schedule 
funding, and unsuccessful local fund-raising, while one 
difference is that more and more funds have been diverted to 
enterprises in producing finished products this year. Wanton 
price revision by some enterprises and overall rises in 
production costs are new causes. 
  He said: The general principle for solving the problem of 
mutual indebtedness among enterprises should be strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control, deepening reform, and 
taking measures aimed at effecting a permanent solution to the 
problem, under which enterprises themselves will be playing a 
leading role in seeing that no new debts will be incurred while 
exercising stricter control over fixed asset investment, 
restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales. 
In the meantime, we need prompt actions that may bring quick 
results, including using the smallest possible amount of credit 
loans to improve cash flow, solving the problem of circulating 
fund shortages among major industries and trades, and 
guaranteeing the normal production of state-owned enterprises as 
well as social stability. 
  It has been learned that major industries selected for 
solving the problems of circulating fund shortages are coal, 
metallurgy, nonferrous metals, electric power, chemical 
engineering, and forestry. Since March, the State Economic and 
Trade Commission, the People's Bank of China, the Industrial and 
Commercial Bank of China, and the Coal Industry Ministry have 
managed to help the metallurgical, electric power, and chemical 
engineering industries settle goods payments due to 20 provinces 
and municipalities and 75 major coal mines. The estimated 
clearance of over 4 billion yuan will help alleviate the coal 
industry's fund shortage problem to a certain degree. 
Currently, thorough investigations into the problem of 
circulating funds shortages in the five industries of 
metallurgy, electric power, nonferrous metals, chemical 
engineering, and forestry in the northeastern region have 
completed. 
  Yang Changji emphasized: In settling the goods payments of 
enterprises among each other, we should lend support to 
enterprises whose products are in demand and marketable and 
refrain from injecting funds into enterprises with slow product 
sales and overstocks. In the meantime, strict checks should be 
conducted to ensure that no circulating funds will go to fixed 
assets, that all loss-making activities caused by fixed assets 
investment will be stopped from top to bottom, and that funds 
designated for settling debts will not be diverted to 
engineering works and equipment under both infrastructure 
construction and technical transformation programs. We should 
intensify efforts to prevent new debts and, in particular, 
enforce strict settlements when dealing with some enterprises 
which simply refuse to pay without reason. Practices of 
unreasonably holding or returning bills or refusing to pay 
without grounds should be rectified conscientiously. 
  Addressing the meeting, Zhang Xiao, president of the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, disclosed: In a bid to 
ease the conditions of enterprises' fund shortages, banks have 
enlarged their margins for loans involving circulating funds 
since the second quarter. Recently, the State Council also 
adopted a policy of handling loans involving circulating funds 
on a case-to-case basis. With all these measures, the problem of 
circulating fund shortages among enterprises should be 
alleviated. She also pointed out: In solving the problems of 
circulating fund shortages and mutual indebtedness of goods 
payments among enterprises, the only way out is to exercise 
stricter control over investment in fixed assets and excessive 
rises in consumption funds and the enforcement of the policy of 
"restricting production, reducing stocks, and promoting sales" 
against unmarketable products -- and not to rely on relaxation 
of the money market.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column by Jen Hui-wen (0117 </F>
1979 2429) written on 18 May 1994 in Beijing: "The Lack of 
Coordination Between Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun's Economic Ideas 
Leaves a Legacy of Trouble"] 
  [Text] The Chinese mainland has adopted the largest number 
of major economic restructuring programs this year. Following 
the high economic growth in 1992 and 1993, this has been another 
year of rapid progress. With all economic relations stretched 
tightly, the inflationary pressures are unprecedented. The 
situation in which two-thirds of large and medium state 
enterprises operate at a loss has been increasingly serious. 
The living standard of urban residents, especially the workers 
and staff members of state-owned enterprises, has dropped to 
some extent. Due to the problems they are experiencing in their 
lives, they may set themselves against the government at any 
time. Meanwhile, there is also a lack of coordination between 
the central and local authorities on whether the scale of 
capital construction should be reduced. Furthermore, April, 
May, and June are the most sensitive months politically. The 
CPC hierarchy is worried that, if the political and economic 
problems unite into a single force through mutual ignition and 
intensification, it will be difficult to keep the situation 
under control. 
  Taking into account the practical situation, the Chinese 
authorities have repeatedly stressed that stability is the 
prerequisite of reform and development since the beginning of 
this year. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed in early 
April that "stability comes before everything else." [wending 
yadao yiqie 4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434] In mid-May he again 
pointed out the need to always "grasp stability as a matter of 
prime importance." Hence, people cannot but feel that there may 
be some unspeakable worries behind the authorities' emphasis on 
stability. 
<H5>  Views of the Two Party Elders on Stability Are Identical </H5>
  This writer revealed on 13 May in this column that it was 
Deng Xiaoping who had the patent rights for the remark that 
"stability comes before everything else." According to a source 
in Beijing, the patent rights for "grasping stability as a 
matter of prime importance" belong to Chen Yun. During his 
inspection tour of Shanghai between 26 April and 6 May, Jiang 
went to Hangzhou to visit Chen Yun. After hearing Jiang's 
report on the recent work, Chen gave a 12-character assessment, 
meaning "a correct judgment of the current political situation 
and a resolute and realistic way of doing things." Chen added: 
"Over the past few years, the economy has developed, society 
has been stable, and the people's livelihood has improved. All 
this shows that, despite having many tasks to perform, we must 
grasp stability as a matter of prime importance. Otherwise, we 
shall pay a heavy price. If any country, big or small, is 
unstable socially and politically, there will be turmoil. Some 
political forces in the West hope for the emergence of great 
chaos and peaceful evolution in China and, therefore, we should 
not lower our guard." 
  As Chen Yun and Deng Xiaoping share identical views on 
stability, the CPC hierarchy is able to carry it out more 
satisfactorily. To ensure that there will be no problems in 
April, May, and June, the CPC hierarchy has adopted three 
measures: First, step up control over news media and propaganda. 
To this end, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department 
has especially set up a "press censorship" organ, which is 
responsible for examining and analyzing the propaganda trends of 
newspapers and journals at central, provincial, municipal, and 
autonomous region levels and making a report to the central 
Political Bureau every week. If problems detrimental to 
stability are spotted, the newspapers and journals will be 
banned immediately. The CPC hierarchy demands that no 
statements that undermine stability be allowed to appear in 
newspapers and journals, particularly during April, May, and 
June. Second, tighten supervision and control over 
"pro-democracy activists" and "political dissidents." It is 
especially necessary to guard against these people going out 
among the workers and staff members of money-losing state-owned 
enterprises and taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of 
unemployed workers to carry out sabotage. To this end, the CPC 
hierarchy has instructed all provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions by cable to set up a "Leading Group for 
Preventing Chaos and Dealing With Emergencies," which has been 
specially tasked to handle these matters. Third, step up 
ideological and political work among enterprise workers and 
staff members who are having material difficulties and make good 
arrangements for their livelihood to prevent the workers' 
dissatisfaction from spreading into society. 
  Chen Yun Says There Are 10 Major Economic Problems 
  The source said: While stressing that stability is a matter 
of prime importance, Chen Yun also talked to Jiang Zemin about 
10 points for attention in economic construction, as follows: 
1) In determining the speed of economic growth, we should 
proceed from our national strength and guard against 
"overheating"; 2) in economic construction, we should 
consistently put efficiency in the first place and prevent 
"excesses"; 3) in reforming state-owned enterprises, which are 
the basis of the state economy, we should base ourselves on 
improving, readjusting, and transforming them rather than 
closing them down, suspending operations, merging them with 
others, or selling them; 4) it is necessary to have an 
appropriate scale of capital construction, to act in strict 
accordance with planning, and to apply administrative measures 
in solving the problem of capital construction getting out of 
control; 5) the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
should curb the practice of getting credits or calling loans in 
violation of the regulations or through personal notes, which is 
still fairly serious, and deal with cadres who violate the 
regulations; 6) it is necessary to keep inflation under control 
and create a situation of a low inflation rate and a fairly high 
economic growth, which has Chinese characteristics; 7) as the 
center of the state's economy and finance, the taxation system 
should be improved and strictly enforced, and the law should be 
applied to plug up loopholes and crack down on violations; 8) it 
is necessary to pay attention to unemployment and work stoppages 
and to make job placement a routine official business, and there 
should be medium- and long-term planning for job placement; 9) 
we should emphasize doing a good job in agricultural production, 
communications facilities, energy development, and residential 
housing; and 10) we should sum up the craze in real estate, 
stock market, and securities speculation and draw up legislation 
and regulations to properly solve these problems rather than let 
the situation become anarchy, which will adversely tarnish the 
state's reputation and causes confusion in people's minds. 
<H5>  What Is the Difference Between the Economic Concepts of Deng </H5>
Xiaoping and Chen Yun? 
  An economist in Beijing pointed out: The guiding idea of 
Chen Yun's 10-point view on economic construction is basically 
the same as that of his talk during the Spring Festival. Both 
are based on "stability," but it is different from what Deng 
Xiaoping advocates. Take as an example their talks in Shanghai 
during the Spring Festival. Deng praised Shanghai's good and 
rapid development, saying that Shanghai must speedily bring into 
play its role as a "locomotive" in promoting China's rapid 
economic growth, and he again stressed Shanghai's important 
strategic position in promoting China's economic development. 
Chen, however, stressed his consistent idea, namely, "the scale 
and speed of construction must be suited to national strength" 
and "it is necessary to strengthen the central authority and 
concentrate all energy on handling major issues." 
  To be specific, Deng Xiaoping stresses the decentralization 
of power, maintaining that regional economic development (such 
as Shanghai) has a more important role in the overall situation; 
Chen Yun, however, lays stress on centralization of power, 
holding that the strengthening of central authority plays the 
most fundamental role in the overall situation. Deng holds that 
"development is the last word," that a basic balance of speed, 
scale, and national strength can be attained in the course of 
seeking development, and that this is more compatible with the 
objective law than the practice of defining first a "national 
strength criterion" and then the development of scale and speed. 
Chen, however, holds that it is of the greatest importance to 
first define a "national strength criterion" and that only by 
keeping development scale and speed in a predefined range can we 
genuinely act according to the objective law and ensure the 
healthy growth of the economy. Deng maintains that the market 
economy enables limited resources to be most efficiently 
developed and that the market economic structure is the basis 
for explaining "why economic scale and speed frequently exceed 
the predetermined range." Chen, however, regards the market 
economic factor as a limited supplementary factor to the planned 
economic structure rather than an economic means that can play 
an objective function to the economic situation as a whole. 
  The economist stressed: The lack of coordination between 
Deng Xiaoping's and Chen Yun's economic ideas is one reason why 
the CPC hierarchy has been vacillating on the major issue of 
handling the relationship between reform and development. The 
CPC hierarchy is trying to strike a balance between the 
different economic views of the two party elders. There are 
indications that Chen's view is more readily acceptable to the 
hierarchy, while Deng's view is more readily acceptable to the 
local authorities. This is also an important reason why there 
are often contradictions between the central and local 
authorities.

<F P=106> [By Xu Yaozhong (1776 5069 0022): "Each Is Doing Its Best </F>
To Stop Losses--A Roundup of State-Owned Enterprises Making Up 
Their Losses"] 
  [Text] State-owned enterprises are the "big brothers" of 
the national economy but their long-standing deficits keep 
worrying us. 
  One-third of state-owned enterprises are obviously suffering 
from losses, one-third are facing latent losses, and only 
one-third are really making profits. This is the current common 
appraisal. Loss-making state-owned enterprises with independent 
accounting amounted to 11,453, accounting for 31.8 percent of 
the total. 
  A comrade in the State Council pointed out: The serious 
deficits in state-owned enterprises have caused them economic 
losses, brought about big difficulties to state and local 
revenues, directly affected sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi 
xu, kuai su, jian kang, 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] economic 
development, and affected the smooth carrying out of enterprise 
reform. Politically, enterprise deficits, their inability to 
pay their employees' wages, and the decline in the employees' 
living standards have seriously affected social stability. 
  The people throughout the country are concerned about making 
up state-owned enterprises' deficits. The government and 
enterprises are considering how to change this situation and we 
are very clear that this situation must not remain any longer. 
<H5>  Introduction of Foreign Capital Yields Good Results </H5>
  In Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, there are 37 state-owned 
enterprises directly under the city's jurisdiction. Thirteen of 
these enterprises were making losses, most of them were only 
making meager profits, and only three of them were making 
profits of more than 1 million yuan. The loss-making 
enterprises either had stopped their production for years or 
were in a state of semi-production. Some could not repay their 
debts or their profits could not offset the interest on loans. 
These enterprises could not make up their deficits. 
  In August 1992, the Quanzhou City authorities sold 60 
percent 
of the assets of these enterprises to the Hong Kong China 
Strategic Investment Company Limited, which became the main 
stockholder. After a year of joint venture, these enterprises 
saw tremendous changes. According to statistics at the end of 
1993, the sales volume in these 37 enterprises increased by 
15.28 percent over the previous year; their taxes paid to the 
government increased by 48 percent; their profits rose by 4.4 
times; and they repaid special loans of 3,027 yuan [figure as 
published]. Their losses were cleared and their profits 
increased by a wide margin. In 1994, these enterprises have 
continued to register a steady growth. Why is it that after 
foreign capital was introduced, these enterprises were so 
greatly different from before? The chairman of these 
joint-venture enterprises gave the following six reasons: With 
the introduction of foreign capital, there is a clear 
distinction between management and ownership and between 
responsibility and duty; these enterprises can obtain foreign 
exchange funds for their technical transformation; they can 
introduce advanced foreign technology and scientific managerial 
methods; they can explore the international market by means of 
the foreign side's relations with other countries, their broad 
channels, and their responsive information; they can put their 
stocks in overseas listings and open the way for raising capital 
abroad; and they have established an effective supervisory 
mechanism. Many people in economic circles say that the 
participation of foreign investors in the formation of limited 
shareholding companies with state-owned enterprises is an 
effective way of transforming state-owned enterprises, making up 
their deficits, and improving their vitality; this bears 
practical significance in helping small and medium state-owned 
enterprises out of their predicaments. Hopwever, in the course 
of implementation there is a need to assess state-owned assets 
rationally to prevent them from being sold at low prices or 
being allowed to drain away. Whether or not the stocks of a 
joint-venture enterprise should be held by the foreign investor 
depends on the specific situation. We should not link an assets 
transfer to the political and social system but should regard it 
as a normal practice in the market economy. 
  Selling assets to foreign investors for joint-venture 
purposes is not an individual case. The Hong Kong China 
Strategic Investment Company Limited alone pooled capital with 
102 light industrial enterprises in Dalian and dozens of 
enterprises in Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Wuxi in running 
joint-venture enterprises in these cities, thus enlivening 
state-owned enterprises there. 
  People in economic circles call this a "China Strategic 
practice" which switches the transformation of enterprises' 
operational mechanism to the transfer of state property rights. 
This is a more thorough way of transforming enterprises' 
operational mechanisms and serves as a foundation for the 
establishment of a new enterprise system. 
<H5>  Orienting Enterprises Toward the Market Gives Much Hope </H5>
  Some enterprise deficits in the 1980's were the "after 
effects" of the traditional planned economy; in the 1990's, many 
enterprises' deficits are the results of their "inability to 
adapt" to the market economy. A state-owned machine-building 
enterprise in northeast China has incurred losses for many 
consecutive years. Its staff members and workers, having 
nothing to do, will usually sit in the sun and play cards in the 
factory compound, waiting for state relief. A small factory of 
a similar type in south China held a trade fair in the city in 
which the enterprise is located. Within a few days, purchase 
orders worth tens of millions of yuan were signed. The 
enterprise staff members and workers in the northeast remained 
indifferent to what was happening around them. There is a 
similar example in Jiangxi. A ramie spinning factory in this 
province has adopted the same method for 10 years, regardless of 
market changes. It has finally changed from a profitable 
factory into a loss-making one. Refusing to adjust production 
in accordance with market changes is an important reason why 
many state-owned enterprises have incurred losses. 
  The Shanxi Dazhong Machine-Building Factory is a military 
industrial enterprise which used to manufacture one type of 
product. It suffered from losses for six consecutive years from 
1986 to 1992 and finally found itself in a predicament. In 1992 
it started adjusting its leading group. As soon as the new 
factory director assumed office, he led the employees in 
breaking away from the traditional planned economy and a closed 
military industrial structure. They removed the barrier between 
the military industry and the market, used the market for 
guidance, adjusted the product mix, and concentrated on 
manufacturing gas stoves, textile winders [luo tong ji 4820 4592 
2623], and other civilian products. As a result, they stopped 
the factory's deficits within four months. The Beijing 
Wristwatch Factory freed itself from its loss-making predicament 
because it "always remembered the market, attentively watched 
the market, and adapted its products to the market." They 
adjusted the factory's operational strategy and product mix, 
switched from manufacturing single-function to multi-function 
wristwatches, and reformed their management system, investment 
orientation, product design, trial production, and reward 
methods. The period for developing new products was shortened 
from six to two months and wristwatch models increased from the 
previous dozens to more than 200. The factory reduced its 
losses by some 7 million yuan in 1992 and made up its deficits 
and began to make profits in 1993. 
  Managerial personnel from some state-owned enterprises which 
had seen improvement said with deep feeling: In the past we had 
blind faith in plans and ignored the market role and, as a 
result, we were abandoned by the market and found the going 
tough. We now trust the market and feel that it can provide 
prompt information. Thus, enterprises can have impetus and 
methods. 
<H5>  Invigorating the Tertiary Industry and Supplementing the </H5>
Secondary Industry 
  Overstaffed administrations, applying for relief when facing 
a small problem, and complaining when there is no problem are 
important reasons why state-owned enterprises have incurred 
losses. When inspecting a coal mine, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
said: To make up deficits, increase profits, and free itself 
from its predicament, an enterprise must tap its potential, 
reduce its personnel, and develop a diversified economy and the 
tertiary industry. 
  Shanxi's Yungang Coal Mine was engaged mainly in mining but 
it was overstaffed. For many years, everyone in this mine had 
eaten from the state's big pot. Before 1991, it incurred 
deficits for many consecutive years. What was to be done? It 
worked out the following method: It fully used the surplus 
personnel to develop the tertiary industry and a diversified 
economy and supplement the secondary industry, with the aim of 
making up deficits. It divided the personnel into three groups: 
One-third continued to carry out coal production, one-third 
engaged in providing service for production and life, and 
one-third engaged in the tertiary industry and a diversified 
economy. It also formed seven companies which had their own 
system and independent management, thus separating them from the 
coal mine. The surplus personnel were given jobs through 
various channels. After a year of practice, the coal mine began 
to make up deficits. The profits gained from the tertiary 
industry and diversified economy contributed to the coal mine's 
turn for the better. 
  The Dalian Heavy Machine-Building Factory--a key enterprise 
in the state's heavy machine-building industry--also suffered 
serious losses. In making up the losses, it did not lay any of 
its personnel off or shift the burden to society but used its 
personnel, labor force, and capital in the commercial and 
service fields and for tertiary industrial development. This 
helped invigorate its dormant capital and boost the surplus 
personnel's initiative. The profits gained from the tertiary 
industry and other diversified operations amounted to 7.7 
million yuan in 1992 and topped 10 million yuan in 1993. 
Invigorating the tertiary industry and supplementing the 
secondary industry are good methods for enterprises to make up 
deficits and increase profits. 
  These methods have been implemented without affecting the 
enterprises' employees' stability or increasing social burdens. 
These methods have practical significance and provide us with 
the following enlightenment: The market economic structure is 
now being established. If we continue to stick to the old 
conventions and restrict ourselves within the limits of the 
secondary industry, we will have no way out. Breaking through 
industrial restrictions and coping with market demands can turn 
surplus personnel into useful assets. 
<H5>  Macrocontrol and Regulation Enliven the Infrastructure </H5>
  It is undeniable that some state-owned enterprises' deficits 
have resulted from faults in macropolicies or ineffective 
macrocontrol and regulation. There are many such examples. The 
economic returns of some household appliance enterprises are low 
because there is too much duplicate manufacture and the markets 
are limited. So, quite a proportion of production remains idle 
and, due to the "bottleneck" restrictions of basic facilities 
and basic industries, many enterprises cannot bring their 
productivity into full play. About one-third of China's 
productivity is wasted because of power shortages or power 
supply restrictions. Inadequate transport facilities have 
caused stagnation in the transportation of raw materials from 
hinterland provinces and have made it impossible for coastal 
areas to display their processing capacity and market role. Due 
to funds shortages, many enterprises cannot buy raw or 
semifinished materials and have thus stopped their production. 
Last year, one-third of light industrial, textile, and chemical 
industrial enterprises in Chongqing City stopped production or 
were in a state of semi-production; and enterprises which had 
stopped production or were in a state of semi-production had 
more than 300,000 employees. 
  Obviously, to make up these losses, the state should bring 
into play macrocontrol and regulation or draw up a rational 
macropolicy. To control investments in fixed assets and adjust 
the investment structure, investments should be oriented to 
"bottleneck" industries and enterprises' technical 
transformation and duplicate manufacture should be stopped. 
Strict control should be exercised over capital investments and 
the release of loans. Limited funds should be used flexibly to 
effectively support enterprise development. The prices of raw 
and semiprocessed materials should be increased appropriately. 
All these are indispensable for establishing a new market 
economic structure and promoting economic development. However, 
these must be processed during an appropriate period and the 
impetus of adjustment must be properly controlled. 
  The state has now introduced quite a number of specially 
targeted policies while encouraging the development of 
"bottleneck" industries; it has made headway in forming the 
financial and taxation macrocontrol structure. This is aimed at 
creating conditions for state-owned enterprises to make up their 
deficits. Only when the state has done well in exercising 
macrocontrol and regulation will enterprises grow stronger and 
enjoy healthy and reliable development. 
  Apart from using the above methods to make up their 
deficits, 
many enterprises, proceeding from their specific conditions, 
have created other methods. For example, the Tianjin No. 1 
Wool Spinning Factory stopped its production for rectification; 
the Beijing No. 2 Wristwatch Factory transformed itself from an 
industrial enterprise into a commercial enterprise; the Shanghai 
No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory introduced an integration 
method; the Handan Steel Corporation introduced a cost 
accounting system related to the market economy; Fujian carried 
out technical transformation; and Liaoning suspended, closed, 
merged, and transferred the production in loss-making 
enterprises. They all made remarkable advances not only in 
making up their deficits but also in increasing their profits. 
  These facts suggest that, like mutual promotion and 
restraint 
between the five elements in nature, enterprises have the 
methods to remedy their losses. This is called "the law is 
stronger than the outlaws." 
  There are many new methods for us to explore in making up 
deficits, such as by introducing reform, applying the market 
mechanism, improving management, and using science and 
technology.

  [Text] Beijing, May 20 (XINHUA) -- A high-ranking Chinese 
trademark official stated here today that the country has been 
taking a clear, firm stance in protecting the exclusive rights 
to registered trademarks. 
  "Violators of trademark laws face harsh penalties -- up to 
life imprisonment and death sentence," said Li Bida, deputy 
director of the Trademark Office of the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce. 
  He was speaking at an international symposium on 
intellectual 
property protection which opened today. 
  The deputy director disclosed that in 12 months from July 
1992, over 3,000 people were handed to the judicial system, 
accused of counterfeiting registered trademarks. 
  Five were sentenced to life imprisonment and four were given 
a death sentence and executed immediately, according to law. 
They were mainly engaged in manufacturing and selling fake and 
shoddy cigarettes, wines, medicines and chemical fertilizers and 
brought great losses to consumers. 
  Other violators were fined heavily. 
  Li Bida said China takes "active measures" to protect the 
registered trademarks of overseas investors. 
  From the time the country joined the World Intellectual 
Property Organization in 1980 until the end of last year, China 
processed 11,144 international applications for territorial 
extension of trademarks. 
  The government not only promptly handles infringement cases 
reported by overseas investors, but also assists them to improve 
their self-protection, Li said. 
  Many world famous companies, such as Mars, Coca Cola and 
Kodak from the U.S.A., have sent letters or silk banners to 
China's local bureau of industry and commerce to express their 
thanks, according to Li. 
  China acceded to the Paris Union for the Protection of 
Industrial Property in 1985, and to the Madrid Union in 1989. 
Its fulfillment of the obligations of a member state has won 
"broad praise" from other countries, he said. 
  It is "by no means an exaggeration," Li told the symposium, 
that China has complied with international practices in respect 
of trademarks classification, general principles and procedures 
in processing trademark applications and registrations, as well 
as in respect of the punishment imposed on trademark rights 
infringers. 
  China has built a legal framework to monitor the protection 
of trademark rights. 
  Li said his office has felt the urge to promote enterprises 
to learn the importance to establish well-known trademarks, 
while stepping up efforts in trademark registration and 
management. 
  China needs to foster more specialists on trademark 
management, he said, adding that China also plans to automate 
trademark registration in the near future. Automatic searching 
is expected to be realized by the third quarter this year, he 
said.

<F P=106> [By Wang Xiangwei] </F>
  [Text] China is drawing up policies to lure foreign 
multinational companies to set up their regional headquarters 
there, according to a senior official with the Chinese Ministry 
of Foreign Trade &amp; Economic Co-operation (Moftec). 
  Ma Xiuhong, deputy director general of the ministry's 
foreign 
investment administration, also said yesterday that the ministry 
would allow foreign multinational companies to set up investment 
vehicles to make direct investments in the country on a trial 
basis. They would also be encouraged to invest in capital and 
technology-intensive projects. 
  Analysts said last night that the new policies would pose a 
serious challenge to Hong Kong and Singapore where foreign 
companies currently base their regional headquarters to direct 
their investment and trade in China. Although Ma did not give 
any further details, analysts said that the new policies 
signalled China's efforts to shift its focus from attracting 
small and mid-size foreign companies to multinationals for their 
deep pockets, advanced technologies, and management experience. 
  Ma said that last year foreign investors spent U.S.$ 27.5bn 
(about HK$214.5bn), up 150 per cent over 1992. But that figure 
is only one fifth of the more than U.S.$110bn total foreign 
investment committed to China in 1993. 
  To date, China has approved 174,000 foreign-funded projects 
with the contract value of foreign investment amounting to 
U.S.$221.8bn, of which U.S.$61.8bn has already been invested. 
  Meanwhile, Zheng Silin, vice minister of Moftec, said that 
China's foreign trade is estimated to reach U.S.$1,000bn in the 
next seven years. Last year, foreign trade was U.S.$195.8bn, of 
which imports accounted for U.S.$104bn. 
  Both Zheng and Ma made the remarks at a seminar, part of an 
on-going trade and investment conference organized by Moftec and 
the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The event, which lasts 
until Thursday, is the largest of its kind held in the territory.

  [Text] China is confident it can hold the yuan at the 
current level of 8.6 to seven to the US dollar in the long term, 
says a senior official of the State Administration of Exchange 
Control (SAEC). 
  "We know foreign investors are concerned about the stability 
of the yuan. We're even more concerned because an unstable yuan 
has many implications for the economy," Yang Gonglin, director 
of the SAEC's policy and regulation department, said yesterday. 
  Speaking at a conference on China trade and investment, Mr 
Yang said it was China's intention to maintain the current level 
of the yuan to the dollar. 
  As part of the move towards full convertibility of the yuan, 
China unified its two-tier exchange rate system in January by 
pegging the yuan at 8.7 to the dollar, the level traded at the 
swap centres. It has since been trading comfortably within 
bank-based margins of 8.6 to seven. Foreign investors said the 
stability on the inter-bank foreign exchange system was more the 
result of support from the People's Bank of China and had little 
to do with market forces. But yesterday, Mr Yang maintained it 
was more a reflection of demand and supply than of the central 
bank's support. 
  Despite earlier worries that China might not have enough 
foreign reserves to stabilise the yuan, Mr Yang said the country 
had seen an increase in its foreign reserves since the currency 
reforms. Official figures, released last week, show that the 
state foreign currency reserves have risen U.S.$8 billion since 
the start of the year. And in April, the inflow of hard 
currency to the banks designated by the People's Bank to handle 
foreign exchange transactions exceeded selling by $3.14 billion. 
  There has been some upward pressure on the yuan recently as 
credit tightening by the banks has made it more difficult for 
companies to secure yuan to finance their operations. As a 
result, companies are selling foreign exchange earnings in 
return for yuan. 
  Trading in China's inter-bank foreign exchange system is 
limited to domestic enterprises, while overseas-funded 
enterprises continue to buy and sell foreign exchange at the 
swap centres. Observers said the inter-bank system was still 
not sophisticated enough and, if foreign enterprises were 
allowed to join it, as was originally planned, it would be 
inundated by the sheer volume of transactions. 
  Mr Yang said there was no timetable for the foreign 
enterprises. He said there were plans to expand the number of 
provincial centres later this year to link them to the national 
foreign exchange centre in Shanghai. Mr Yang said the reforms 
introduced in January were designed to achieve full 
convertibility of the yuan in the country's current account in 
the near term.

  [Excerpt] The Chinese government has withheld announcing 
urban inflation figures for April. Officials apparently hope to 
distract attention from soaring city prices, which could 
exacerbate unease in the weeks leading up to the fifth 
anniversary of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests. 
  The cost of living in 35 cities rose by 23.3 per cent in 
April, down from 24.5 per cent in March, according to sources at 
the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) in Beijing. But, in 
announcing inflation figures last week, officials released only 
the national urban-rural average. Regarding the cities, the 
bureau said only that the rate of big city inflation had slowed. 
The unpublished April urban figure was the second consecutive 
monthly drop from the peak of 25.9 per cent in February, but the 
moderate rate of decline was a blow to the State Council's much 
ballyhooed price inspection campaign carried out in March and 
April, which officials had hoped would bring the urban figure 
below 20 per cent. 
  "These big cities are a special situation. They are not 
representative of the overall success of the campaign," an SSB 
official said. 
  The overall picture showed national consumer price inflation 
slowing to 21.7 per cent in April, from 22.5 per cent in March. 
Beijing has set a national inflation target of 10 per cent for 
the year, which many officials have already publicly discounted 
as unrealistic. SSB sources said administrative measures had 
been largely ineffective in controlling prices, both in big 
cities and in small towns. 
  The State Council team sent to Guangdong reported in 
mid-April that "price hiking momentum is relatively grim" after 
inspecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Dongguan. 
  Hubei's vice-governor, Chen Shuiwen, reported at the end of 
April that "the progress of the general price inspection has 
been uneven". 
  "Price increases in some localities have not been 
effectively 
controlled. The prices of a few commodities have even bounced 
back up again," Chen said. [passage omitted]

"China's Export Is Troubled by Antidumping Policies"] 
  [Text] China's economy has developed rapidly in the 1990's 
and currently ranks side by side with the world's major trading 
nations. In 1993, China's foreign trade reached $195.7 billion. 
However, while China's economy and trade are striving to move 
toward and converge with the outside world, it is troubled by 
the antidumping policies of foreign countries. Hong Kong's 
economy is closely linked with that of mainland China and 
inevitably feels the impact of antidumping moves. Concerned 
quarters are urging the mainland and Hong Kong to advance or 
retreat together and join hands to deal with this issue. 
  According to reports from Beijing, Li Lanqing, vice premier 
of the State Council of China, pointed out a few days ago: The 
antidumping issue has an important bearing on China's export, 
and, if it is not properly handled, there will be the danger of 
complete collapse. 
  In fact, China has been accused by foreign countries of 
dumping an accumulated total of more than 150 kinds of export 
products and has been forced to pay antidumping taxes on them. 
Last year alone, China was accused of dumping goods in nearly 
100 cases, which directly involved over $30 billion of its 
export volume, constituting a considerable threat to China's 
exports. 
  On 14 April last year, the Mexican Secretary of Commerce and 
Industrial Development announced at a press conference that 
Mexico would conduct an antidumping investigation into more than 
4,000 types of products under 10 categories from China and, at 
the same time, would increase antidumping taxes by a large 
margin. To date, this is the world's biggest antidumping case. 
  If things continue in this vein, the concerned official 
pointed out, the normal development of China's exports will 
certainly be adversely affected. Even if China is able to 
restore its status as a signatory state to the General Agreement 
on Trade and Tariffs in the future, the advantages it derives 
will be offset. 
  Therefore, economic and trade circles from the mainland and 
Hong Kong have repeatedly called for fighting antidumping 
accusations. Various quarters have attached importance and have 
responded to this call. It has been revealed that China will 
formulate various measures to deal with antidumping accusations 
and has demanded that the problem be thoroughly solved. 
  These measures include stepping up the formulation of an 
antidumping law so that there can be guiding principles for 
antidumping work. At the same time, China will strengthen the 
position and role of commercial import and export chambers and 
will authorize these chambers "to be responsible for organizing 
and coordinating antidumping accusation defense work" and to 
manage and coordinate the work of various trades. In addition, 
China will strengthen the management and control of sensitive 
export commodities. 
  At the same time, China will, by inviting tenders for export 
quotas, levy export tariffs, implement measures such as 
temporary active quotas, and exercise quantitative control over 
some export products. 
  China will set up an antidumping defense foundation to take 
a 
stand against antidumping accusations. China will also 
energetically train antidumping personnel to cope with a large 
amount of antidumping defense work abroad and investigation on 
import commodities. 
  The Ministry of Trade and Economic Cooperation will hold an 
antidumping forum with the United States and the EC this year. 
China will also maintain close ties with Hong Kong's commercial 
circles in order to jointly do a good job in antidumping work 
and to facilitate the smooth development of foreign trade.

<F P=106> [By Tan Hongkai: "Government To Imprison Copyright </F>
Buccaneers"] 
  [Text] The government plans to jail copyright pirates, 
Minister of Justice Xiao Yang said yesterday in Beijing. 
  "Criminal sanctions must be imposed on those who commit 
intellectual property right offences to safeguard the integrity 
of ideas and the dignity of law," he told the International 
Symposium on Intellectual Property Protection. 
  Currently only civil procedures are available for copyright 
infringements. Criminal sanctions are reserved for trademark 
violators. 
  Chinese lawmakers are also pushing through legislation on 
border controls where intellectual property rights are violated, 
according to Xiao. 
  "Customs will play a bigger role in intellectual property 
protection through prohibiting import and export of the relevant 
commodities," he said. 
  The government moves will guarantee implementation of the 
National Commitments outlined by the Paris Convention on 
Protection of Industrial Intellectual Property and the Berne 
Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Xiao 
said. 
  Patent protection has been extended to cover chemicals, 
medicines, food, beverages and condiments in China. And company 
logos now enjoy the protection previously offered trademarks. 
  Lawmakers are still debating how best to legislate for 
biological patents. But the government has promised to write 
flora and fauna into the law within two or three years, 
according to Ma Lianyuan, vice director of the State Patent 
Office. 
  The moves are an important step in China's efforts to 
internationalize its patent system. Ma said. 
  Liu Jiyang, chief secretary of the China Intellectual 
Property Society, revealed that the National People's Congress 
was considering legislating against compact disc piracy and 
trademark counterfeiting. 
  Calling the country's trademark protection "comprehensive 
and 
effective," Li Bida, Vice Director of the Trademark Bureau under 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), urged 
foreign trademark owners to learn more about Chinese laws to 
avoid wasting time. 
  Ignorance of the law can unnecessarily prolong the suffering 
of foreigners, when they find their trademarks have been abused 
and they want help from the Chinese authorities, he said. 
  Foreign trademark owners should go to SAIC authorized 
departments to file their complaints, he said. 
  He also advised foreigners to pay more attention to the 
"roots" of trademark infringements. 
  "Although some offences take place in China, they do not 
necessarily originate here," he pointed out. "Trademark owners 
should track down the culprits by following the clues to find 
out those behind the scenes." 
  Many cases of foreign trademark infringement are actually 
committed by foreigners, he asserted. 
  "Protection of registered trademarks is an international 
problem it demands common action by the world as a whole," he 
said. "Mutual reproach is of no benefit." 
  The two-day international symposium attracted 130 experts, 
lawyers and business people from China Australia, Britain, 
France, Germany Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Thailand and the 
United States, as well as from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Influx of Services Seen"] </F>
  [Text] Access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (Gatt) is likely to make China a net importer of services, 
a senior economist warns. "A consequent influx of foreign 
higher-quality and lower-cost services will pose a threat to 
China's international balance of payments," said Chu Xiangyin, a 
professor at the University of Foreign Trade and Economics. 
  China signed a general agreement on trade in services as 
part 
of the final act of the Uruguay Round of Gatt talks in Morocco 
last month. 
  While admitting that China will benefit somewhat from the 
agreement, Chu says the challenges are demanding. 
  The core of the agreement on trade in services is 
transparency in trade regimes, unconditional 
most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment, greater market access and 
equal treatment for domestic and foreign businesses operating in 
China. 
  All in all, China, like other signatories, will have to open 
its markets wider to foreigners when the agreement takes effect 
early next year. 
  Chu outlined three major threats to China's service 
industry: 
  -- First, the inflow of foreigners will squeeze domestic 
sectors still in their infancy. Although he did not elaborate, 
it's apparent that banking is one of these sectors. 
  -- Second, sectors such as aviation and telecommunications 
are related to State sovereignty and security, and lack the 
guidance of a complete legal system. 
  "When there's not a complete law to regulate the operation 
of 
foreign transnationals, the potential threat (to State safety) 
cannot be ruled out," Chu said. 
  -- Third, China's trade in services is still on a low level, 
despite fast development over the past decade. 
  The service trade in China has yet to regain the form of its 
heyday in the 1950s, let alone catch up with developed countries 
or even some developing nations. 
  Chu pointed out that services accounted for a smaller 
portion 
of China's gross domestic product, than the average level among 
developing countries for 1984, which the World Bank put at 37 
per cent. 
  Peter Sutherland, Gatt's Director-General, said in a recent 
speech in Beijing that poor availability of services, including 
finance and transportation services (especially in inland 
areas), is among the challenges still to be faced by China's 
reforms. 
  But Chu also pointed to some positive factors for China's 
service trade when the country gains access to Gatt. 
  On the one hand, he said, developed countries are seeking 
opportunities to provide technical assistance to developing 
countries such as China. On the other hand, foreign competition 
will force domestic suppliers to improve their quality. 
  Moreover, while opening up its own market, China will gain 
easier access to foreign markets. 
  He suggests that the government find ways to bolster the 
country's service exports. 
  Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi has said China will 
strive to seek a balance of payments in its service trade. 
  Chu also suggests that China make public regulations for its 
service trade, except those that might threaten State security. 
  "Now, it's time for us to develop our service trade in full 
swing," Chu said, adding that China should absorb what it can 
from all over the world. 
  "But," he cautioned, "foreign services which may lead to 
environmental pollution or the leakage of State secrets should 
not be encouraged."

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wang: "Gatt May Help Bring On Deficits"] </F>
  [Text] Access to the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (Gatt) could be a double-edged sword for China's exports, 
a senior trade expert said. 
  While helping balance the richer east and poorer west 
(because GATT calls for trade policies to be applied uniformly 
across the country) among other merits, the access could well 
cause trade deficits for China for a long time, said Wang 
Xinkui, deputy director and professor of the Shanghai Foreign 
Trade Institute. 
  The trade balance could deteriorate (on the basis of the 
level observed before the access) in the immediate future, he 
added. 
  "For, in general, it will be easier for foreign businesses 
to 
enter into the Chinese market than for Chinese companies to 
enter into foreign ones, as soon as China assumes a freer trade 
policy upon access to Gatt," he explained. 
  Soaring imports could emerge as China switches from a 
planned 
economy to a market-based one. 
  During the transitional period, imports are expected to run 
out of control to a certain extent when trade is deregulated. 
  This situation is set to be aggravated if domestic 
enterprises go for imports in a blind way as the national 
economy continues to expand in the fast lane. 
  "Moreover, a huge demand for foreign consumer goods by 
ordinary people will be a potential stimulus to new rounds of 
imports," Wang said. 
  But he admitted that re-entering Gatt will provide China 
with 
an opportunity to readjust its foreign trade pattern which 
developed in the 1980s. 
  The pattern is characterised by a favourable tilt towards 
the 
country's coastal regions, labour-intensive industries and a 
narrow export market concentrated on the United States, Japan 
and Hong Kong. 
  The pattern has produced three major problems for China's 
foreign trade, Wang said. 
  First comes the worrisome export growth momentum, which is 
maintained by the supply of more export goods whose prices have 
been drifting downward most the time. 
  China's overall export price level in 1990 dropped by 12.4 
per cent over that in 1981, although the annual trade volume 
grew by 12.3 per cent from 1981-90. 
  "The bottom reason for the worsened export efficiency is 
that 
China failed to establish new money-spinning industries (such as 
machinery processing) when the costs of labour and raw materials 
soared up to hamper the competitiveness of the labour-intensive 
industries, like textiles," Wang said. 
  Second comes the imbalanced development between the east and 
the west. 
  The third is that China's exports are unduly focused on a 
few 
markets. 
  Statistics show that exports to the US, Japan, Hong Kong and 
Macao accounted for 68.3 percent of China's total in l991, up 
from 53.1 per cent in 1980. 
  To break the undesired pattern Wang said China must lose no 
time in bolstering a cluster of new technology-intensive 
industries, which will be the mainstay of the national economy 
in the next century. 
  Priorities should include the heavy chemical, machinery, 
electronics and telecommunications sectors. 
  These sectors have been a weak link in the Chinese economy, 
which in the 1980s favoured labour-intensive sectors, such as 
textiles industry. 
  "China should take advantage of its treatment as a 
low-income 
nation after rejoining Gatt to protect these new industries by 
resorting to tariff and non-tariff measures on a selective 
basis." Wang said. 
  These industries should establish systems that promote 
large-scale production via corporate alliances and annexations, 
he added. 
  China should also take advantage of easier access to more 
overseas markets, which will apply lower tariffs to China after 
its re-entry into Gatt, to cultivate more export markets other 
than just the few mentioned above. 
  The biggest headache for China's exports is that there are 
no 
powerful transnational companies that can compete effectively in 
the world market. 
  He urged the government to further wean itself from meddling 
in the business operation of large and medium-sized State 
enterprises, so that they will be more competitive.

<F P=106> [By Jin Man: "Foreign Trade To Account For Half of GDP in </F>
1994"] 
  [Text] Foreign trade will make up nearly half of China's 
gross domestic product (GDP) this year, if the devaluation of 
renminbi yuan is taken into account. 
  The proportion was 37 per cent last year, with a foreign 
trade volume of $195.7 billion versus a GDP of about 3 trillion 
yuan. (The official exchange rate then was 5.7 yuan to the US 
dollar.) A conservative estimate puts China's 1994 foreign 
trade volume at $200 billion, which would be tantamount to 1.74 
trillion yuan at the current exchange rate of 8.7 yuan to the 
dollar. 
  Ji Chongwei, an official with the State Council Development 
Research Centre, says the country's foreign trade is expected to 
continue double-digit growth in the remainder of the 1990s, 
faster than that planned for the national economy. 
  China's foreign trade accounted for only 9.9 percent of GDP 
in 1978 when the country first opened itself to the outside 
world. 
  The export volume accounted for about 18 per cent of the 
country's GDP last year, compared with 10.4 per cent in 1988. 
  "This high ratio is rare among the world's major countries," 
Ji noted. 
  China's exports saw a heady recovery in the first four 
months 
of this year from the corresponding period last year. 
  Experts are predicting that exports are unlikely to be so 
sluggish again this year because the hectic domestic market has 
calmed down. 
  A recent report from the State Planning Committee said that 
more than 90 per cent of the country's commodities supplies 
balance or even outweigh demand. 
  The report also said that investment in fixed assets -- a 
key 
factor affecting inflation -- has been brought under control. 
  The latest statistics indicate that the country's commodity 
retail sales prices in April grew by 19.5 per cent over the same 
period last year. This was lower than in March, when the growth 
rate was 24.5 per cent. 
  A more mild domestic market is generally conducive to export 
growth. 
  Last year, a hectic market at home, compared with a sluggish 
international one, drew a lot of resources that should have been 
exported. 
  Foreign Trade Minister Wu Yi says that the adoption of the 
uniform rate 8.7 yuan to the dollar has also boosted exports. 
  But analysts have expressed concern that a drastic price 
spiral at home has virtually offset all the benefits brought by 
the yuan's devaluation. 
  Chinese companies are now facing prohibitive export costs 
and 
demands by foreign importers to cut their export prices. 
  The State has made it a top priority to curb spiralling 
prices this year, but the battle continues. 
  Another problem facing China's exports is that there are 
only 
a few kinds of money-spinning items available. 
  The biggest generator of export income, textiles, faces 
strict import quotas in the United States, the European Union 
and other importers.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186): "Why the </F>
`Foreign Moon' Is No Longer Round--An Analysis of 
Foreign-Invested Enterprises' Losses"] 
  [Text] The "Foreign Moon" Is Not Completely Round 
  Several days ago, a friend told me that a joint-venture 
cosmetics company in Shanghai had incurred a serious loss. I 
was indeed astonished to hear this. The pride of Shanghai's 
joint-venture enterprises, this company manufactures products 
that sell very quickly; why has it fallen into such a 
predicament? 
  This is not the only example. A medical equipment company in 
southern China, about which foreign businessmen had been 
optimistic, recently incurred a loss. Everyone was baffled upon 
hearing the news. 
  The first joint-venture enterprise emerged in China in 1980, 
and there are more than 100,000 foreign-invested enterprises in 
the country. The direct introduction of foreign capital totals 
tens of billions of U.S. dollars, presenting a scene of rivalry 
for supremacy and playing an important role in China's economic 
life. Statistics show that the per capita output value, per 
capita profit and tax, as well as the labor productivity of 
foreign-invested enterprises are higher than those of 
Chinese-funded enterprises. Foreign-invested enterprises have 
introduced capital, technology, and advanced management methods 
and operational forms. This is why the people in many 
state-owned enterprises say: The "moon" imported from abroad is 
indeed rounder than our "moon"! 
  But it is hard to understand that, following the increase in 
investments, the "foreign moon" is no longer "round": Some 
foreign-invested enterprises have incurred losses each year and 
seem to have an uncertain future. 
<H5>  Are They Really Incurring Losses or Are They Pretending To </H5>
Suffer From Losses? 
  The losses incurred by foreign-invested enterprises can be 
classified as follows: 
  The first are normal losses. Over the last few years, a 
large number of foreign-invested enterprises have started their 
business in China, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the total 
number of enterprises in operation. These enterprises have just 
started operation (such as running hotels), so they are still in 
a debt repayment and trial production period. In addition, some 
foreign investors have had ambitions that were too great when 
they arrived in China, like a "tiger wanting to eat the sky," 
and their mistakes in finding markets has also affected the 
development and sales of their products. These enterprises 
account for about half of the loss-incurring enterprises, a case 
similar to that in developed countries. 
  The second is abnormal losses, which are mainly as follows: 
  Losses in accounting. Some people say: "State-owned 
enterprises have purposely reduced their losses, whereas 
foreign-invested enterprises have purposely exaggerated their 
losses." These remarks are not unreasonable. Last year only 25 
percent of the foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing incurred 
losses, but they exaggerated it to 50 percent. To fully take 
advantage of the preferential policy of "two exemptions, three 
reductions," some foreign-invested enterprises have regarded the 
profit-making year as a loss-incurring year to evade taxes. A 
strange situation has even emerged in which some enterprises 
have registered consecutive losses or zero profits, but, in 
pooling capital, they keep increasing their investment and 
recruiting more employees. In 1987 a Xiamen joint-venture 
company's investment was $900,000, and its current assets amount 
to 100 million yuan, but the company has been infamous for its 
longstanding "losses." 
  Losses caused by profit transfers. Wholly-owned 
foreign-invested enterprises account for about 20 percent of the 
total number of foreign-invested enterprises. Some wholly-owned 
foreign-invested enterprises (mostly Hong Kong and Taiwan 
invested enterprises) have made tacit agreements with 
enterprises outside the country by taking advantage of their 
imports and exports. When importing raw materials and 
equipment, they raise the prices on the import declaration 
forms; when exporting finished products, they reduce the prices 
on the export declaration forms, and sell the products outside 
the country at high prices. This transfers the profits to 
regions outside the country. Foreign businessmen in some 
joint-venture enterprises also resort to this "clandestine" 
method of transferring profits which should have been shared by 
both sides, leaving losses for the joint-venture enterprises. 
Foreign businessmen in some joint-venture enterprises introduce 
obsolete or poor-quality equipment at high prices, so that, the 
higher the prices, the more percentage of shares they hold, and 
the higher profits they enjoy. Moreover, high-priced equipment 
has caused an increase in the enterprises' production costs and 
a decrease in their profits. This also constitutes a loss. 
  Losses due to operation and management. Quite a number of 
small and medium joint-venture enterprises do not have clear 
management responsibility or duties. Only when there is a 
purchase order will the director of the foreign side appear; on 
ordinary occasions, he will not. So some enterprises cannot 
even hold board of directors meetings, and only temporary 
measures are applied to daily operations, thus causing 
operational confusion and a decline in economic returns. Some 
foreign investors in China have merged their offices with the 
joint-venture enterprises, causing large-scale operations and 
low output. In this case, these enterprises have inevitably 
incurred losses. Some representatives of the Chinese side let 
the joint-venture enterprises take charge of the workers' 
welfare, but personnel from outside the country working in these 
enterprises have major expenses. Such a person in a Shanghai or 
Guangzhou joint-venture enterprise requires at least $150,000 a 
year for his salary and daily expenses. Some foreign investors 
force the joint-venture enterprises to pay the expenses of their 
mother companies. 
  Furthermore, some foreign-invested enterprises have rushed 
to 
start their operations with obsolete equipment and inadequate 
funds. It is difficult for them to carry out technical 
transformation or update the equipment, and this has resulted in 
delays in their production and operations and has finally caused 
losses. 
<H5>  The "Foreign Moon" Is Also a Moon </H5>
  Foreign-invested enterprises constitute a vital force in the 
national economy and whether they incur losses or make profits 
affects the entire process of utilizing foreign capital. On the 
whole, though some foreign-invested enterprises are incurring 
losses, they are not as serious as some people imagine. Some of 
these enterprises are improving, and we should soberly 
understand and appraise this situation. Press reports over the 
last few days indicate that 80 percent of the 4,000-odd 
foreign-invested enterprises operating in Shanghai are making 
profits. 
  As a matter of fact, there are complicated factors causing 
the foreign-invested enterprises to incur losses. "Paying 
learning fees" in the course of introducing foreign capital is 
inevitable. Most of the foreign investors in China are abiding 
by the principle of "mutual benefit," but some of them are 
playing tricks to make exorbitant profits by taking advantage of 
the Chinese side's eagerness to introduce foreign capital and 
its lack of experience in international economic cooperation. 
The most important thing is that we should acknowledge this 
fact: The "foreign moon" is also a moon. When providing a 
preferential policy, we should be bold in "closing the 
loopholes" in all areas. Only thus will both sides make common 
development and will enterprises thrive. 
  Tax evasion generally exists in the world (particularly in 
transnational corporations). Tax evasion bears a strong nature 
of concealment and "rationality." Tax reductions or evasions 
can be achieved by filing false reports on "losses." Raising 
the prices of low-price raw materials imported from abroad and 
transferring profits are common commercial methods. How should 
we fully utilize foreign capital and ensure the state's and 
enterprises' profits? 
  An expert has pointed out that, on one hand, we should 
improve the relevant foreign-related policies and tax laws so 
that there no loopholes; on the other, we should improve the 
quality of the Chinese side's personnel, gather information on 
the international market situation (such as the buying and 
selling prices of commodities) and customers (such as conducting 
inquiries, surveys, or asset appraisals), establish intelligence 
or information networks with Chinese organizations stationed 
abroad or accounting offices which have business relations with 
China, to promptly close loopholes and reduce losses. In 
particular, qualified accountant offices or other authoritative 
organizations should be invited to appraise the material 
invested as stock by foreign businessmen, to avoid being led by 
the nose by foreign businessmen. 
  The management and operation of foreign-invested enterprises 
should be gradually standardized, with a focus on the cautious 
selection of construction projects to be carried out, to prevent 
errors and mistakes. The introduction of unmarketable products 
or equipment should not be approved. We should not be 
overanxious for quick results in enterprises whose conditions 
are not yet mature. We should factually determine the 
expenditure standards for managerial personnel, establish a 
supervisory system, and train a number of foreign sales 
professionals and accountants for the Chinese side. In the 
course of operation, we should strictly practice the principle 
of "jointly undertaking risks and commonly enjoying profits" and 
prevent enterprises from "incurring losses without cause." 
  Of course, cooperation in all fields is necessary to change 
the situation of losses in foreign-invested enterprises.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Foreign Firms Benefit From New Tax Regime"] </F>
  [Text] The new taxation system is creating an equitable 
payment environment for both domestic and foreign firms, said a 
senior tax official. 
  This year, the sweeping changes of tax policy in China will 
not end tax exemptions for foreign-funded productive enterprises 
in their initial two years of profitable operation, said Dong 
Shukui, deputy director of the overseas-related tax bureau under 
the State Administration of Taxation. 
  He added that the newly introduced value-added, consumption 
and operational taxes have equalized the government's tax levies 
on both Chinese and foreign enterprises. 
  Dong reiterated that the valued added tax (VAT) has more 
advantages compared with the old turnover tax, known as the 
consolidated industrial and commercial tax (CICT), which was 
applied to most foreign businesses before this year. 
  The new VAT regime provides a channel for businessmen to 
claim refunds of VAT assessed on certain goods, mainly raw 
materials. 
  This could help reduce the production costs of foreign 
businesses in China. 
  Exporters might also benefit from the new regime for the 
same 
reason. 
  They are now entitled to claim a monthly VAT refund from 
Chinese authorities, representing the VAT incurred on the 
acquisition of VAT-recoverable goods and services. 
  Foreign businesses engaged in industries, where the 
proportion of VAT-recoverable purchases as a percentage of 
turnover is high and where the new VAT rate is lower than the 
old CICT rate, may also benefit from the new regime. 
  However, China's tax collecting officials admitted that the 
new tax reforms have caused confusion and other problems. 
  The current high retail price level, which stood at more 
than 
20 per cent during the first quarter, was partly due to the 
misunderstanding by many taxpayers on the new tax system. 
  They also failed to know the regulations on issuing special 
receipts for VAT and "blindly" raised their products' prices. 
  To cope with this situation, the government's tax collectors 
pledged to take prompt measures to ensure their smooth 
implementation, including sending working teams to grass-roots 
areas to enforce the new laws and the collection of State 
revenue. 
  Dong said a patient introduction of the country's new tax 
system to foreign businesses is especially crucial to the 
country's opening drive as well as the economic reform. 
  The reformed taxation system now specifies 11 items of tax 
collection on foreign-invested firms and overseas businessmen in 
China. 
  They involve industrial production, consumption, business 
operation, institutional and individual income, natural 
resources and land utilization, real estate, stamps, automobile 
and ships, and animal slaughter. 
  This year, some provinces and municipalities have also cut 
down their money collection on 21 categories of products 
manufactured by foreign-invested factories, Dong noted. 
  These products are mostly computers, TV sets, refrigerators, 
tape recorders, drinks, cigarettes, air-conditioners and a 
cluster of chemical goods.

  [Text] Beijing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
Securities Commission noted at its fourth plenary session that 
it has decided to establish a system of coaching [fu dao 6534 
1418] listed companies, with the belief that securities markets' 
healthy development is based on their good management. 
Beginning this year, an enterprise will be coached for six 
months before it is allowed to issue stocks. In 1995, to help 
businesses replace their operating mechanisms and regulate their 
operations, businesses with prospects of selling stocks will be 
coached for one year -- six months before and six months after 
they sell stocks. 
  Liu Hongru, vice chairman the State Council Securities 
Commission and chairman of the China Securities Supervision and 
Administration Committee, chaired and addressed the meeting 
about the supervision of the securities market over the past 
year and what will be done next. The meeting maintained: Under 
the State Council's leadership and the guidance of its 
"Tightening Macroeconomic Control Over Securities Markets 
Circular," government authorities, securities commission member 
units, and securities supervision committees have given priority 
to drawing up a law governing the stock market and to 
supervising the law's enforcement and the stock market's 
performance, thus upholding the principle of "exercising control 
and supervision over the securities market according to law." A 
new order of the securities market, especially the stock market, 
has thus been established. Since 1993, businesses raised 22.6 
billion yuan through selling 4.6 billion yuan of A-class stocks 
to individual buyers. Markets for B-class stocks have also 
developed. While developing the domestic stock market, 
calculated steps have been taken to develop stock markets 
abroad. Currently, eight businesses are now selling stocks in 
Hong Kong and other parts of the world. Of these eight, the 
stocks of seven are listed in Hong Kong. Fairly good results 
have been achieved in the great deal of work done in supervising 
the brokerage businesses' performance. 
  Analyzing the stock market, the meeting maintained that 
China's market is still in an embryonic stage, the nation should 
proceed cautiously step by step in developing its stock market, 
and it should make positive efforts in exploring a course for 
developing its stock market -- a course which is in line with 
the nation's socialist market economic system -- through 
improving various regulations and rules, strictly enforcing the 
law, and regulating the operations. 
  According to Liu Hongru, because of the coaching system, 
most 
of the public stocks will not be sold to individual buyers and 
corporations until next year -- with the exception of those 
stocks that have already been allotted to local authorities or 
departments. The meeting pointed out that the way to issue new 
stocks will be improved by requiring prospective buyers to open 
accounts at the stock market, by controlling price increases, 
and by lowering operating costs. To tighten supervision over 
the listed companies, certain regulations governing these 
companies' replacement of operating mechanisms will be drawn up. 
Moreover, to guard against manipulation and under-the-table 
deals, trading regulations and supervisory measures will be 
improved. Securities organs and brokers violating laws and 
regulations will be punished according to the law. To increase 
the number of long-term investors, positive efforts will be made 
to cultivate institutional investors, and investment funds open 
to society will be allowed to be established in China. Pilot 
projects for issuing B-class stocks will be expanded, and the 
marketing of H-class stocks and their supervision will be made 
more efficient. The meeting reiterated that businesses within 
China must have State Council Securities Control Committee 
approval before they can sell their stocks overseas. The 
meeting said that supervision over the stock market must be 
tightened, that the stock market must operate ethically, and 
that precautionary measures must be taken to guard against 
corruption. 
  The meeting examined and approved the measures drawn up by 
the China Securities Supervision and Administration Commission 
for regulating and stabilizing the stock market. These measures 
will be carried out step by step after full preparations have 
been made by the commission as well as by other relevant 
departments and committees.

<F P=106> [By Zheng Jie: "Financial Picture Looks Rosy"] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai's overall financial situation is stable 
and sound, though the supply of capital remains short, according 
to a top banking official. 
  Mao Yingliang, president of the Shanghai branch of the 
central bank, said recently that the development of the 
financial industry is compatible with the city's healthy 
economic growth. 
  According to Mao, local specialized banks added 22.6 billion 
yuan ($2.6 billion) in deposits in the first quarter, surging 85 
per cent over the same period last year. 
  Of the total, private savings deposits more than tripled 
from 
the first four months of 1993 to 10.9 billion yuan ($1.25 
billion). 
  On the premise of keeping the amount of lending within the 
limits drawn by the central bank, Mao said, financial firms have 
intensified their support of the key areas of the city's economy. 
  According to Mao, financial institutions extended 2.8 
billion 
yuan ($322 million) in loans in April. 
  Priority has been given to key national projects in the city 
and local pillar industries, including telecommunications, 
automobiles, chemicals and power, according to the president. 
  Mao noted that local financial reform is being carried out 
in 
an orderly way and that a breakthrough has occurred in the 
reform of the foreign exchange system. 
  Turnover on the Shanghai-based China Foreign Exchange Trade 
System, a national inter-bank centre for trading hard currency 
that officially opened early last month, has surpassed $3 
billion and HK$2.7 billion [Hong Kong dollars]. 
  In that time, according to Mao, authorized foreign exchange 
banks have bought $790 million from businesses and sold more 
than $400 million. 
  On the securities market, transactions in the January-April 
period totalled 243 billion yuan ($27.9 billion), nearly 59 per 
cent higher than a year earlier. 
  Mao said the industry continues to open up, with 100 
overseas 
financial operations having come in. 
  By the end of the first quarter, total assets of overseas 
financial firms amounted to $2.9 billion, a rise of 16 per cent 
over the first three months of last year. 
  Though the situation is generally good, problems still 
exist, 
particularly in the supply of capital, Mao said. 
  Growth in production and inflation have contributed to 
rising 
demand for capital, Mao said.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China's investment 
funds have been expanded from a mere two in 1991 to over 60 at 
present. 
  These funds have raised more than 800 billion yuan so far, 
and about 30 of them have been listed on the stock exchanges at 
Shanghai and Shenzhen. 
  Experts here agree that the rapid development of China's 
investment funds is an outcome of the current reform of the 
banking system. 
  Being a new financial instrument, the investment funds will 
play an important role in stabilizing the securities market, and 
in the reform of the capital market and investment system, 
according to the experts. 
  The investment funds have invested 40 percent of their 
capital in securities and the rest in real estate and economic 
entities. 
  At present, about 200 investment funds with a combined 
amount 
of capital of 30 billion yuan are waiting for approval from the 
People's Bank of China (the central bank), which is working out 
regulations on investment funds.

  [Text] Presidents of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao working 
on the mainland will have to apply for a work permit and have it 
renewed annually as China tightens its control of the labour 
market. Residents from the three areas will need valid permits 
from early this year. 
  Labour Ministry spokesman Liu Guanxue said the move was 
aimed 
at controlling the number of foreign workers. The growth of 
foreign workers threatened opportunities for local people he 
said. Exact quotas had not been fixed, but Mr Liu said the 
application fee for permits would be "minimal". 
  New regulations make employers responsible for applying for 
permits for their staff from labour bureaus. Applications then 
go to the Labour Ministry for approval. Failure to comply with 
the procedures would result in the disqualification of employees 
from working in China. 
  Applicants for permits should hold travel documents and 
would 
be required to provide evidence of their qualifications to prove 
their calibre and experience. The regulations also stipulate 
all employment contracts should follow Chinese law. The Labour 
Ministry would resolve contractual disputes by reference to the 
local legislation.

<F P=106> [By A.R. Wilkie] </F>
  [Text] Dissidents who are on the run from the Chinese 
police say their outlawed labour organisation is getting 
stronger, even though two of its leaders are in jail and a third 
has fled the country. 
  Liu Mianchun, who was detained briefly during the visit by 
the U.S. Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, has so far 
escaped arrest while travelling in east China, gathering support 
for his Alliance for the Protection of Labourers Rights -- or 
the Labour Alliance. 
  The Labour Alliance, which models itself on the Polish union 
Solidarity, claims to have a core membership in several 
provinces. 
  "Give us until the end of the year, and we will have a 
national framework," Liu said. 
  "We need six months to set up an organisation in every 
provincial capital and in the big cities," said Zhang Lin, 
another labour organiser who is also travelling around the 
country. 
  "We are looking for people who have been in prison, who have 
stood up well under pressure, people with that sort of 
experience. We can't have weak-willed people who are going to 
betray their comrades and their friends," he said. 
  The Labour Alliance says it carefully examines the 
qualifications of potential members and is setting up several 
levels of membership. The front line will campaign openly, but 
behind it will be second and third tiers operating covertly and 
waiting to take the place of the front line should its members 
be arrested. 
  Faced with such an organisational structure, the Communist 
Party cannot fail to be aware of the parallels with its own 
early revolutionary years. 
  It is impossible to gauge the support for such organisations 
as the Labour Alliance. Activists claim a membership of 300 but 
an effective police sweep of key figures -- who may total no 
more than a few dozen people around the country -- could 
probably cripple the fledgling organisation. 
  Two organisers, Yuan Hongbing and Zhou Guoqiang, are already 
in jail, as is Xiao Biguang, a friend of Yuan. Another 
organiser, Wang Jiaqi, a close colleague of the exiled labour 
leader Han Dongfang, was also arrested but later escaped and 
fled the country. 
  Predictions that the Labour Alliance could mount a genuine 
challenge to the Communist Party are premature. 
  But the Communist Party is clearly worried because it is 
aware that dissatisfaction among the peasantry and workers is 
ripe for exploitation by competing political forces. While the 
Labour Alliance is concentrating on the peasantry and state 
workers, other activists are trying to establish independent 
trade unions in joint ventures in China's southern boom towns, 
where working conditions are sometimes comparable to sweatshops. 
  According to the activists, some smaller, pro-democracy 
organisations have joined the Labour Alliance. To do this, the 
organisations agree to give up advocacy of violence and abide by 
the rules of the Labour Alliance. 
  "Some organisations don't want to give up their advocacy of 
violence," Zhang said. 
  "Other people think we're too dangerous because this is 
organised. It is completely different from the individual 
dissent of the past." 
  Support for the Labour Alliance is also coming from hitherto 
more conservative groups, according to labour activists. They 
claim that Christians are increasingly seeing political struggle 
as the only way ahead. Younger members of the 
officially-sanctioned democratic parties are increasingly 
frustrated by these parties' lack of substance, and are also 
turning to overtly pro-democracy, if illegal, organisations. 
  It is not clear whether this is a widespread trend or just a 
few isolated cases of interest in the Labour Alliance. It does 
seem, however, that the Communist Party is eager to crack down 
on the unofficial church -- aware that it could become a focus 
for political dissatisfaction, as it did in Eastern Europe. 
  Further evidence that the leadership is nervous as the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre approaches came from 
Beijing University last week. Last Monday cadres at the 
university, which was at the heart of the 1989 anti-government 
demonstrations, held a meeting at which they were told to 
heighten vigilance in the run-up to June 4. Although students 
are not known to have formed a pro-democracy organisation at the 
university, activists are at work, a source said. 
  "Leaflets commemorating those who were killed on June 4, 
1989, are appearing in dormitories, slipped under doors in the 
middle of the night," a former student, with links on the 
campus, said. 
  However, pro-democracy campaigners say that much as they 
would like to hold protest activities around that time, security 
may be too tight. 
  All state work units have been ordered to have three people 
-- the leader, a secretary and a driver -- on duty 24 hours a 
day from now until after the danger period is over. They are 
expected to react immediately if there are protests in the 
vicinity, and to keep a close eye on their own workers.

  [Text] Shenyang, May 22 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
is committed to create as many jobs as possible in carrying out 
the labor reform, according to a senior government official. 
  Speaking at a recent conference on labor restructuring here, 
Zhu Jiazhen, vice-minister of labor, said that the labor reform 
and related reforms in distribution and social security have 
been carried out smoothly all over China. 
  The labor reform involves all enterprises with different 
ownerships, while a number of labor-related laws will be 
formulated soon, he said. 
  One result of the reform is that China now has 55 million 
contractual workers, he revealed. 
  "I believe that the labor reform will facilitate the 
establishment of a modern enterprise system, the expansion of a 
market economy and improvement in productivity," he told the 
conference. 
  On the other hand, businesses will also have more and more 
surplus workers, he said. 
  It is, therefore, essential to the success of the labor 
reform to balance the relations between the labor reform and 
employment, he noted. 
  China has 600 million laborers, more than any other country. 
So the Chinese Government has the responsibility to create as 
many jobs as possible for an increasing number of job seekers, 
he said. 
  The solution to the unemployment problem requires concerted 
efforts of enterprises and society as a whole, the vice-minister 
said. 
  Most importantly, the solution lies in expanding the 
country's economy, readjusting its industrial structure and 
boosting its service sector, he added. 
  Laborers should be encouraged to renew their concepts of 
value and find jobs through markets, he said. 
  "Why is it that so many farmers can find jobs in cities, 
while many urban residents cannot? Because many urban residents 
seek white-collar jobs only, which are limited in number," he 
said. 
  The vice-minister also pointed out that the introduction of 
a 
social security system is crucial to social stability and the 
success of the labor reform. 
  The reform of the medical service system has been carried 
out 
throughout China, he said. 
  A province-wide health insurance scheme to which employers 
and the employees pay a proportion of salary has been launched 
in 13 provinces, he said.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (CNS) -- Shanghai made known its 
target for progress in technology to be achieved by industry and 
enterprises this year. 
  -- The development of the backbone industry and new high 
technology industry will be accelerated in their exploitation. 
The sales value of pillar industry, including automobile, 
communications equipment, power station equipment and computer, 
will increase by 30 percent over last year. There will be 20 
other key professions to have their sales value rise by 25 
percent. 
  -- Quality of products will be improved, which will then 
reach the international standard. There will be 400 enterprises 
to have their product quality upgraded to various extents during 
this year. About 80 percent of main industrial products will 
reach the international standard of the 1980s, and 10 percent 
that of the early 1990s. Meanwhile, old fashioned products will 
be eliminated. 
  -- Exploitation of new products will be sped up with some 
20,000 new items to be developed within this year, about 50 
percent of which will be available in the market following 
appraisal and inspection. This scheme will be centered on those 
items on trial production which register an annual output value 
of RMB 10 million [renminbi] and new items whose an annual 
output value is estimated to be over more than RMB 100 million. 
The newly-increased output for all these items is put at RMB 11 
billion. 
  -- Foreign capital will continue to be used for renovation 
of 
old enterprises. There are 3,000 items across the municipality 
to bring in foreign investment during this year. The number of 
items each valued at over U.S.$10 million is 100. The target is 
set for the introduction of 80 world known companies into 
Shanghai to make investment which can help achieve an increased 
output value of RMB 40 billion. 
  The Vice Mayor Mr. Jiang Yiren who is in charge of industry 
and economy outlined the basic idea for technological progress 
involving industry and enterprises. The idea mainly lies in 
making the market a core and in speeding up the structural 
adjustment as well as upgrading the economic results achieved by 
pillar industry. It also covers the acceleration of 
technological renovation in the course of the reform of the 
enterprise management. Modern enterprises will be set up 
through means of technological renovation and joint venture. 
Foreign capital will be fully used for the improvement of 
technology involved, while model and quality of products will be 
continuously renewed.

  [Text] Shanghai, May 24 (XINHUA) -- This, China's largest 
metropolis and economic center has a basic system in place to 
prevent deterioration of the environment. 
  "The amount of major discharged pollutants has dropped and 
the quality of the local environment has improved vastly," Lu 
Shuping, a specialist in environmental protection, said. 
  "But noise pollution is getting worse," noted Lu, also 
director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Environmental 
Protection. 
  Shanghai, with a population of more than 13 million, is 
China's largest industrial city. 
  To ensure that its people to live in a clean environment, 
the 
municipal government has adjusted its industrial structure and 
industrial locations in a scientific and rational way in recent 
years. At the same time it has concentrated on the treatment of 
water and air pollution, along with the construction of 
infrastructural facilities and basic industries. 
  As a result, the director noted, the quality of water and 
air 
has improved to some degree, but noise still exceeds the set 
standard due to the construction of urban facilities and the 
increase in the number of motor vehicles. 
  According to the latest statistics, the amount of discharged 
industrial waste water in 1993 was 6.52 percent less than in 
1992, and that of water after treatment increased by 5.47 
percent. 
  The rate of industrial waste water treated last year reached 
82.3 percent, up 5.3 percent over the previous year. 
  According to the statistics, the amount of discharged 
domestic sewage last year went up by 105 million tons and that 
of sewage treated by 96.9 million tons. 
  All this shows that Shanghai discharges an average of 5.567 
million tons of waste water a day, of which 63.1 percent is 
industrial-use water and the rest domestic sewage. 
  According to the expert, the amount of sulphur dioxide, 
smoke 
and industrial dust, which are regarded as major pollutants in 
waste gases, shrank by 14.1 percent, 15.9 percent and 3.4 
percent, respectively, last year over 1992. 
  The rate of utilization of solid industrial pollutants is 
83.7 percent and that of the treatment of garbage 71.6 percent. 
  According to the director, the main pollutants in local 
water 
are ammonia, nitrogen, chemicals and oil. 
  A recent survey on the upper reaches of the Huangpu River 
showed that the water quality was better than in 1992 and the 
amount of dust in the air over the city was less than in 1992. 
  Lu said that the municipal government is working out an 
overall program to clean and beautify the environment so as to 
control pollution and improve the quality of the surroundings. 
  The program includes construction of sewage treatment, waste 
water discharge and garbage disposal projects. 
  In addition, the municipal government will strengthen noise 
control, including banning the use of motor vehicle loudspeakers. 
  It will also develop cooking gas facilities and plant more 
trees, flowers and lawns in and around the city, Lu said.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The State Education 
Commission from this year forward will share costs for selected 
universities with local governments. 
  A spokesman announced here today that the commission will 
jointly build Xiamen University with the Xiamen Municipal 
Government. 
  The university, which is located in the Xiamen Special 
Economic Zone facing the Taiwan Straits, was previously mainly 
financed by the central government. 
  In the next four years beginning this year, the Xiamen 
Government will provide 10 million yuan each year to support the 
university, with the State Education Commission providing the 
rest. 
  Another three universities and colleges jointly built by the 
State Education Commission and the local government are in 
Shanghai. They are Fudan University, Shanghai Communications 
University and Shanghai Foreign Languages College. 
  The reform is the latest effort to ease the funding 
difficulty in universities. Teachers' salaries are expected to 
rise after the reform. 
  The local governments will acquire part of the rights to run 
those universities.

  [Text] Nanning, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The ever-improving 
investment environment in this capital of the Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region has brought in a steady flow of overseas 
investment, according to Nanning Mayor Xie Ruxuan. 
  Xie said that in the first four months of 1994, Nanning 
signed 40 cooperation projects with overseas firms, involving 18 
million U.S. dollars in total foreign investment. 
  In 1993, the city approved the establishment of 242 
foreign-funded firms, involving 82.4 million dollars in total 
overseas investment, he said. 
  Nanning currently has 386 foreign-funded businesses in such 
areas as transportation, energy, farming, construction, finance, 
commerce and real estate, the mayor said. 
  Of the 386 businesses, 19 involve an investment of at least 
10 million dollars each, he added. 
  Since 1992, Nanning has stepped up infrastructure 
construction to pave the way for the influx of overseas 
investment, he said. 
  For example, the capacity of automatic telephone exchanges 
in 
the city soared to 65,000 lines in 1993 from 15,000 lines in the 
previous year. 
  Xie announced that an investment fair and a commodities fair 
will be held in Nanning June 15-18 to seek overseas investment 
in urban construction and property development, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the Hainan </F>
Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second Session of the 
First Hainan Provincial People's Congress on 3 March 1994: 
"Work Report of the Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate"] 
  [Text] Deputies, 
  In 1993, the provincial procuratorial organs at all levels 
conscientiously carried out the work deployment of the 
provincial party committee and the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, put into practice the guidelines of the First 
Session of the First Provincial People's Congress, effectively 
performed the basic duties of procuratorial organs regarding 
"cracking down on crime, protecting the people, supervising law 
enforcement, and serving the economy," stuck to the work 
principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking firm control 
of handling cases," firmly grasped the work focuses of 
anticorruption struggle and severe crackdown on serious criminal 
offenses, and intensified the supervisory work of law 
enforcement and the building of procuratorial personnel, so that 
new progress was made in all fields of endeavor. I should now 
like to brief you on the conditions of our major tasks as 
follows: 
<H5>  I. Resolutely Carrying Out the Unified Deployment of the </H5>
Party's Central Committee and Provincial Party Committee on 
Anticorruption Struggle and Concentrating Our Efforts on 
Checking and Acting on Major Important Cases of Corruption and 
Bribery 
  In 1993, procuratorial organs at all levels across the 
province accepted and heard 527 cases of economic crimes 
including corruption, bribery, and so on, and placed 177 cases 
on file for investigation and prosecution. Of the total, there 
were 89 corruption cases, 17 bribery cases, and 49 cases of 
misappropriation of public funds; there were also 134 major 
cases involving 10,000 yuan or above, which accounted for 75.7 
percent of the total cases filed for prosecution, higher than 
the national average of 29 percent. Of the major cases 
involving more than 10,000 yuan, five cases involved between 
500,000 and 1 million yuan, and nine cases exceeded 1 million 
yuan. In these important cases, seven cadres at and above 
county departmental level were investigated and acted upon. In 
addition, 13 cases of tax evasion or tax resistance and five 
cases of forged trademarks were filed for investigation and 
prosecution and legal proceedings were also instituted against 
129 offenders. Economic losses recovered for the state and the 
people amounted to 74.24 million yuan. Taken as a whole, 
relatively remarkable achievements have been made by the 
province's procuratorial organs thanks to their clear-cut 
guiding ideology on the anticorruption struggle. After Comrade 
Jiang Zemin's speech at the Second Plenum of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection was published, the 
provincial party committee called an enlarged meeting of the 
standing committee to make arrangements for the anticorruption 
struggle, thus creating a favorable macroclimate for the 
struggle. In light of the deployment made by the provincial 
party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the 
party group of the provincial people's procuratorate 
successively called a number of special meetings to study the 
anticorruption struggle. Our general idea was: While waging the 
struggle, the procuratorial organs should fight on two fronts -- 
1) in society, we should resolutely punish economic criminals 
involved in corruption, bribery, and so on, increase the 
crackdown intensity, and stop the corrupt phenomena from 
spreading; and 2) within the ranks of cadres, we should 
intensify education on honesty and self-discipline, concentrate 
our efforts on rectifying malpractices, severely check and act 
on the corrupt elements who seek personal interests by abuse of 
power, and purify the contingent of procuratorial personnel. In 
line with this idea, we made concrete assignments for the 
procuratorial organs throughout the province to carry out the 
anticorruption struggle in timely fashion. As a result, the 
province's procuratorial organs at all levels took prompt action 
to conscientiously put into effect the central instructions on 
the campaign against corruption and, in light of the 
requirements set by the provincial party committee and the 
people's procuratorate, concentrated their energy on 
investigating and dealing with the major important cases, 
thereby starting an upsurge in handling cases. The number of 
cases filed for investigation and prosecution since last August 
increased substantially compared with the first half of the 
year. The number of cases accepted and heard during the five 
months from August to December was 159 more than that in the 
previous seven months, while the number of cases filed for 
investigation and prosecution and the number of major important 
cases identified and dealt with were 29 and 30 cases more 
respectively than those in the previous seven months. Several 
exceptionally big cases which had a bearing on society were also 
checked and acted upon, which included the frame-up and 
bribe-taking case of Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general 
of the provincial government office; the fund misappropriation 
and bribe-taking case of Jia Xiaoming, former clerk of the 
international business department of the People's Construction 
Bank of China, Hainan Branch; the embezzlement and bribe-taking 
case of Lin Guangsen, general manager of Hainan Kanghai 
Industrial Corporation; and so on. In addition, we also 
organized various forces to participate in checking and dealing 
with the "17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud and the 
exceptionally big swindling case of the Great Wall Science and 
Technology Industrial Company which shook the entire country. 
While paying serious attention to placing cases on file for 
investigation and prosecution, procuratorial organs at all 
levels also took the settlement of cases as a significant aspect 
which reflected the achievements of investigating and dealing 
with major and important cases in that stage. They investigated 
and wound up a number of cases in a timely manner and, in 
coordination with the courts, prosecuted and openly dealt with a 
number of criminal offenders. For example, the Haikou City 
People's Procuratorate concentrated its picked personnel on 
handling and winding up the most serious bribery case since the 
PRC's founding at a fast speed by working extra hours, where 
five principal criminals, including Xue Genhe, were sentenced to 
death according to the law in late September and three other 
criminals were sentenced to imprisonment for set terms. Another 
criminal, Jiang Wei, former head of the provincial planning 
department, who was investigated by the anticorruption bureau of 
the provincial people's procuratorate for his involvement in the 
extremely big bribe-taking case, was prosecuted by the people's 
court and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his 
political rights for life in mid-October. 
  In summing up the anticorruption work over the past year, 
particularly since last August, we have adopted the following 
principal measures: 
  1. We conscientiously intensified leadership and 
guidance over the anticorruption work. At the beginning of 
last year, the provincial procuratorate sent four work teams led 
by members of the party group to go deep into the grass-roots 
units, inspect their work, and provide them with guidance. In 
the second quarter, it again enlisted four work teams to help 
grass-roots units screen the accumulated cases and place new 
cases on file for investigation. In April, a forum of the 
provincial chief procurators was held to put into effect the 
guidelines of the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the 
intensification of the anticorruption struggle. The provincial 
people's procuratorate issued a circular to the lower levels on 
the enhancement of anticorruption work and a provincial meeting 
on case reporting work was also held at the end of that month. 
In July, we convened the second provincial procuratorial work 
meeting, at which we adopted the "Decisions on Further Enhancing 
Anticorruption Work To Serve the Socialist Market Economic 
Development in the Special Economic Region" and the "Decisions 
on Launching Law Enforcement Activities Among the Procuratorial 
Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents of enforcing 
the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized way. In 
the second half of August, we called an emergency teleconference 
on anticorruption work to promptly transmit to the lower levels 
the spirit of the central authorities on the campaign against 
corruption, proposing nine concrete measures for anticorruption 
struggle in accordance with the actual conditions of Hainan, 
including: Calling for provincial procuratorates at all levels 
to publicize their telephone numbers for case reporting once 
again; practicing a system under which mass reporting was 
accepted 12 hours a day and chief procurators would receive 
informants on certain days; setting up a command and 
coordination center for investigating and handling major 
important cases; publishing FANTAN KUAIXUN [NEWSLETTER ON 
CAMPAIGN AGAINST CORRUPTION]; dividing the province into 
eastern, central, and western battlefields and enlisting special 
forces to give guidance to the handling of cases in the 
respective battlefields; stressing the importance of chief 
procurators' taking the initiative in handling cases, 
particularly the major and important ones; and so on. According 
to statistics, of the 25 procuratorates in the province, 31 
cases involving corruption, bribery, and others were 
investigated and dealt with personally by chief procurators and 
59 cases were handled with their participation. By so doing, 
they set a very good example for the procuratorial personnel. 
In November, we again held meetings in the abovementioned three 
battlefields, calling for procuratorial organs at all levels 
across the province to firmly grasp the work in the last two 
months of the year and concentrate efforts on investigating and 
solving some more cases, prosecuting some other offenders, and 
coordinating with the courts for public trials for a number of 
cases to reflect the achievements at that stage. 
  2. We took powerful measures to mobilize the masses to 
report cases. Early last year, the provincial people's 
procuratorate and HAINAN FAZHI BAO jointly sponsored an "award 
competition on legal knowledge of the campaign against 
corruption and bribery" and comparatively good social results 
were scored. In the course of implementing the central 
guidelines on anticorruption since August, the procuratorial 
organs at all levels throughout the province had positively 
coordinated with various party committees and governments in 
conducting propaganda and mobilization work on a relatively 
grand scale, and various localities had made use of newspapers, 
radio stations, television stations, and other media to openly 
reveal a number of typical cases. Chief procurators also made 
televised or broadcast speeches. In the meantime, telephone 
numbers for case reporting were made public again and boxes for 
case reporting increased in number. Some county and city 
procuratorates also sent propaganda cars to tour villages, 
factories, mines, and farms to extensively mobilize the masses 
to report economic crimes of corruption, bribery, and so on, 
thereby releasing the enthusiasm of the masses for case 
reporting. In September alone, 173 cases were reported and 
accepted for hearing, which was 3 times more than the figure for 
the previous eight months, i.e., 55 cases on average. In 
October, the number of cases increased by 18 percent over 
September. During the five months between August and December, 
788 cases were accepted and heard, 92.7 percent more than in the 
corresponding period of the previous year, and 379 cases more 
than those for the first seven months in 1993. This was the 
peak period with the largest number of cases reported and 
accepted since the founding of the reporting centers of the 
provincial procuratorial organs. Moreover, there was a special 
feature of "three mores and one greater," i.e., more signed 
reports on cases, more clues provided for major and important 
cases, and more reports concerning key departments, with a 
greater value for investigation. 
  3. We stressed the key points and concentrated our 
efforts on investigating and dealing with the criminal cases 
concerning the key departments. In light of the 
requirements of the central authorities, procuratorial organs at 
all levels focused the crackdown on the criminal cases such as 
corruption, bribery, and so on committed by personnel in party 
and government organs, as well as in judicial, administrative, 
law enforcement, and economic management departments. During 
the five months between August and December, procuratorial 
organs throughout the province placed 44 corruption and bribery 
cases involving personnel from the abovementioned departments on 
file for investigation and prosecution, accounting for a quarter 
of the total cases on file. Of this total, there were 14 cases 
that involved 20 personnel from the judicial department for 
their conduct in extorting confessions from legal offenders or 
government workers by torture, or of releasing them privately in 
dereliction of their duties. There was a great and shocking 
impact on society when these cases were checked and acted upon, 
which attained good legal and social results and further 
demonstrated the determination of the party and government to 
punish corruption. 
  4) We lost no time in tracking down embezzled 
money and did our utmost to recover the economic losses of the 
state. In checking and acting upon the corruption and 
bribery cases, procuratorial organs at all levels not only 
persisted in severely punishing criminals in accordance with the 
law but also surmounted all difficulties to trace and recover 
embezzled money in good time. Take the Xue Genhe case as an 
example. After most of the embezzled money, totaling 33.44 
million yuan, had flowed out into a dozen provinces, 
municipalities, and autonomous regions all over the country, the 
personnel in charge of the case overcame various difficulties, 
particularly the obstacle of local protectionism, to track down 
and seize nearly 30 million yuan. Another 14 million yuan was 
also chased after and recovered from the Jia Xiaoming and the 
"17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud cases, which 
were handled by the anticorruption bureau of the provincial 
people's procuratorate. Illicit money and stolen property 
equivalent to 74.24 million yuan were recovered last year, which 
witnessed the largest amount of economic losses to be recovered 
by the procuratorial organs since the founding of the province. 
  In short, since last year, and since last August in 
particular, the province's procuratorial organs have taken the 
initiative in firmly grasping the work to punish corruption and 
check and act on major important cases so that the campaign 
developed in depth in a healthy and orderly way. However, 
judging from the conditions of investigating and dealing with 
cases by the procuratorial organs, the tasks of the 
anticorruption campaign were still extremely arduous and heavy. 
Though we should affirm our achievements, we must not be 
blindly optimistic. The principal characteristics of the cases 
of corruption, bribery, and other economic crimes which occurred 
in the province were as follows: First, the amount of money 
involved in the economic crimes was increasingly larger. Over 
the past few years, the proportion of major cases that involved 
an amount of more than 10,000 yuan, which had been filed by the 
province's procuratorial organs for investigation and 
prosecution, had exceeded 70 percent, ranking in the forefront 
of the entire country. This reflected the extreme rapacity of 
the criminals. Second, there were a large number of crimes 
committed in defiance of the anticorruption campaign, as 70 
percent of the crimes were committed last year after the 
crackdown began, which manifested, to a certain extent, hfow 
rampant the criminals were. Third, the bribery offenses either 
took the form of covert activities like "between you and me" or 
the form of overt or semi-overt actions under the pretext of 
engaging in the market economy. Some people took advantage of 
the power in their hands to seek personal benefits, refused to 
perform official duties without being paid, or even openly asked 
for and accepted bribes under pretexts of every description. 
Fourth, criminal cases in the economic hot spots increased and 
the tactics were repeatedly changed. Some lawbreaking elements 
committed crimes by availing themselves of loopholes in the 
reform and opening up, the transformation from old to new 
structures, and the still unsound management mechanisms. For 
instance, some personnel in securities departments embezzled 
money by making use of "time differences" or "price differences" 
in stock trading; others misappropriated public funds for 
speculation in stocks, land, houses, and so on to reap 
exorbitant profits. The new situation and problems had 
increased the difficulty of the procuratorial organs in their 
law enforcement activities and, at the same time, set even 
higher demands on them. Fifth, the corruption and bribery 
criminals generally committed a variety of crimes. They usually 
embezzled public funds and asked for and took bribes and so on. 
After obtaining large sums of money, they squandered it by 
eating and drinking extravagantly, gambling, and patronizing 
prostitutes, so that the state property suffered great losses. 
  At present, the anticorruption struggle is developing in 
depth, the masses hate the corrupt phenomena bitterly, and their 
enthusiasm in the struggle is very high. However, people will 
also discover that in some enterprises, there are cases which 
have not been reported because they were afraid of washing their 
dirty linen in public as this would tarnish their image and 
affect their rating. Hence, they would rather gloss things over 
within the enterprises to avoid trouble or report the cases only 
after the offenders had run away with the money. Some of them 
worried that they would draw fire on themselves if they exposed 
such offenses, and others dared not report those corrupt 
elements with power and influence, lest their own economic 
interests be damaged. What is more, in investigating and 
dealing with the major important cases, more often than not, the 
procuratorial personnel encountered some interference and 
obstruction because some people considered the anticorruption 
struggle as conflicting with reform and opening up. They were 
anxious that the investigation and prosecution of cases by 
procuratorial organs would adversely affect reform, opening up, 
and economic construction. This added manmade difficulties to 
the handling of cases. As viewed from the conditions of work 
performed by the province's procuratorial organs, there was 
still a long distance to go from the requirements of the central 
authorities and provincial party committee and from the 
expectations of the people's deputies and the broad masses. In 
procuratorial organs at various levels there were some major 
important cases which had been placed on file for investigation 
and prosecution but had not been wound up in good time; some 
evidence in cases reported by the masses had not been fed back 
as preliminary investigations had not been conducted; and, in a 
few localities, lots of work had been done but very few results 
in handling the major important cases had been scored. In 
addition, the tight funds for handling cases and the backward 
means of communications and investigation also restricted the 
solution of cases to a certain extent, thus hindering the 
progress of the anticorruption struggle. These problems should 
be conscientiously resolved in out future work. We are firmly 
confident that under the leadership of the provincial party 
committee and party committees at various levels, under the 
supervision of the people's congresses at various levels, and 
with the support of governments, cadres, and masses throughout 
the province, still greater achievements will certainly be 
attained in investigating and dealing with the major important 
cases and remarkable results will certainly be obtained in the 
anticorruption struggle in our province. 
  II. Cracking Down Unremittingly and Severely on 
Serious Criminal Activities and Safeguarding Social Stability in 
the Hainan Special Economic Region 
  It was another work focus of the procuratorial organs to 
severely crack down on serious criminal activities. Since last 
year, procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province 
have persistently taken the "severe crackdown" struggle and 
participation in the overall control of social security as an 
important task to safeguard social stability in the special 
economic region and ensure the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. Accordingly, new 
achievements have been attained. In 1993, the province's 
procuratorial organs at all levels accepted and heard 2,578 
people, whom the public security organs proposed to arrest and 
2,239 people of them were finally arrested. Besides, they also 
accepted and heard 2,659 people transferred from the public 
security organs for prosecution and legal proceedings were 
initiated against 2,301 of them after examination and 
investigation. 
  In the "severe crackdown" struggle we stuck to the principle 
of dealing with crimes severely and rapidly according to the 
law, with stress on cracking down on serious criminal cases and 
organized underworld gangs, including murder, robbery, rape, 
causing explosions, armed violence, and so on, so that their 
arrests were approved and prosecution initiated in good time. 
During the whole year, 519 criminals in major or exceptionally 
serious cases were arrested, accounting for 23.2 percent of all 
criminals arrested. In order to reflect the principle of dealing 
with crimes severely and rapidly in procuratorial work, the 
people's procuratorates at all levels throughout the province 
persistently practiced the system of attending to major and 
exceptionally serious cases ahead of time. This meant: 1) 
participating in the activities of on-site inspections, 
examining corpses, and so on; 2) participating in the 
preliminary trials of defendants and questioning important 
witnesses; and 3) participating in discussions with 
investigation departments concerning the nature, evidence, and 
other matters in some major difficult cases. According to 
statistics, at the stage of obtaining approval for arrest, the 
procuratorial organs throughout the entire province attended to 
several major or exceptionally serious cases ahead of time, in 
which 247 people were involved; and at the initiating 
prosecution stage, they also attended to cases involving 81 
people ahead of time. Take the extraordinarily serious case 
committed in Haikou City as an example, the defendant Zhang 
Weisen stole two submachine guns, three pistols, and 600 rounds 
of ammunition from the Xiuying Frontier Station. As the Haikou 
City People's Procuratorate sent personnel to attend to the case 
ahead of time, it took only three days to have the case 
prosecuted and lodged with the court after the public security 
organ wound up the case and transferred it to be examined for 
prosecution. 
  We intensified supervision over investigation and trial in 
the work of obtaining approval for arrest and prosecution. With 
regard to the intensified supervision over investigation, this 
focused on the malpractices of sparing some crimes without being 
investigated and dealt with and of imposing fines in lieu of 
penalties. With regard to the intensified supervision over 
trials, this focused on the malpractices whhereby those guilty 
of crimes were acquitted, those having committed serious crimes 
were given mild punishment, and those having committed minor 
crimes were punished drastically. Over the past year, with the 
supervision of procuratorial organs over investigation, 
decisions had been made to reject applications for the arrest of 
104 people, as legal requirements for their arrest had not been 
met; while 64 people who should have been arrested but were not 
reported by public security organs for approval, were arrested 
by follow-up decisions. A total of 104 cases involving 422 
people were returned to the investigation department for 
supplementary evidence mainly because the facts of their crimes 
had not been distinctly established and evidence was inadequate. 
As regards investigation activities in violation of the law, we 
made written or oral suggestions to correct them in good time. 
Owing to our supervision over trials, decisions had been made 
to exempt 23 people from prosecution, while 14 offenders who 
should have been indicted on criminal charges but had not been 
reported to the procuratorial organs, were finally prosecuted. 
Besides, opposition was made to 35 cases which were wrongly 
adjudicated, of which 11 cases were settled by the court and 
verdicts in six cases involving 10 people were readjusted. 
  We took an active part in the struggle and rectification in 
specific operations. Proceeding from the local reality, the 
procuratorial organs at all levels across the province 
coordinated with the public security organs and courts in the 
unified action of "unearthing criminal gangs, striking at 
convicts on the run, chasing escaped criminals, and solving 
serious cases," as well as in the struggle in specific 
operations aimed at combating theft, besieging "train robbers 
and highwaymen," cracking down on the abduction of women and 
children, prohibiting prostitution, and so on. Rectification in 
specific operations was conducted in areas where problems were 
numerous and public order was in chaos, to effectively safeguard 
social stability in the province and ensure the safety of the 
people during major festivals. 
  We paid serious attention to the ratification of arrest and 
prosecution to guarantee the quality in handling cases. First, 
we further established and improved various handling procedures 
and laid firm hold of rules and regulations to ensure the 
quality. Second, we stepped up investigation and study of the 
new situation and problems and correctly distinguished between 
crimes and noncrimes. For instance, aiming at the problems in 
some localities where a lot of cases had been returned for 
investigation, pronounced not guilty, or exonerated from 
accusation without good reasons, we carried out investigation 
and study and proposed improved measures to step up the 
inspection of crucial cases and key units. The province's 
subprocuratorate held a seminar to discuss the knotty problems 
that had cropped up in areas under its jurisdiction in a bid to 
better resolve the problems encountered in handling difficult 
cases. Third, we took firm control of the work of prosecuting 
criminals in court in order to elevate the overall level of 
public prosecutors' ability in argument and prosecution in court. 
  While waging the "severe crackdown" struggle, procuratorial 
organs at all levels firmly grasped the implementation of 
various measures for the overall control of social security in 
their work. 
  In handling cases, they paid attention to 
discovering the hidden trouble in the management work of 
relevant units, made suggestions from the procuratorial points 
of view in a timely manner, and helped relevant units plug 
loopholes to reduce crime. In light of the procuratorial work, 
they positively conducted law propaganda in various forms and 
practiced a system of paying visits to, making observations of, 
providing help for, and carrying on education among the 
exonerated individuals and criminals serving sentences out of 
prison to prevent them from committing new crimes and to reduce 
the unstable factors in society. They also handled letters and 
visits from the masses in a timely manner and conscientiously 
conducted education to straighten out their sentiments to avoid 
sharpening the contradictions and to expeditiously eliminate 
various unstable factors. In coordination with relevant 
departments, they set up contact points for the overall control 
of social security and launched activities to build a clean and 
honest administration with concerted efforts. Moreover, they 
set up prevention organs in the anticorruption departments, 
placed the work of preventing corruption, bribery, and other 
economic crimes as an important item on the agenda, and studied 
measures for putting an end once and for all to the breeding of 
corrupt phenomena. 
  Safeguarding political and social stability in the country 
is 
an important guarantee for reform and development. Generally 
speaking, social security in our province is good at present. 
However, we must also note soberly that the social security 
situation in our province is still grim, as the occurrence of 
serious criminal activities is showing a rising trend and 
serious cases of violence such as murder using firearms, 
robbery, and so on are still running rampant. Comparing 1993 
with 1992, the number of serious cases rose by 7.3 percent and 
that of extraordinarily serious cases by 8.9 percent. Criminal 
activities conducted by gangs are also rather serious, 
particularly by those engaging in theft and robbery along 
railroads and highways and those composed of hooligans, some of 
which have become underworld gangs. Along with constantly 
deepening reform and the readjustment of interest relations, new 
contradictions and problems will continue to crop up and factors 
affecting political and social stability in our province may 
increase. Since the tasks of the "severe crackdown" struggle 
are still extremely formidable, we absolutely must not relax our 
efforts to deal heavy and rapid blows at the serious crimes in 
accordance with the law. The procuratorial organs at all levels 
across the province must bring into full play their major 
functional role as instruments of the people's democratic 
dictatorship in safeguarding the political and social stability 
in our province while persisting in implementing the "severe 
crackdown" principle and closely coordinating with the 
departments of public security organs, courts, and so on. 
<H5>  III. Seriously Checking and Acting on Criminal Cases of </H5>
"Infringing on Rights," Neglecting Duties, and Comprehensively 
Performing Procuratorial Work in Various Aspects 
  -- Procuratorial work in respect of law and 
discipline. Procuratorial departments in charge of law and 
discipline at all levels across the province seriously put into 
practice the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking 
a firm hold of case handling," positively coordinated with the 
anticorruption struggle, and focused their work on investigating 
and dealing with the offenses of "infringing on rights" and 
neglecting duties, such as practicing favoritism, committing 
irregularities, extorting confessions by compulsion, illegally 
detaining people, trifling with their duties, causing accidents 
through negligence, and so on. Last year, 212 cases of such 
offenses were accepted and heard, 24.7 percent more than 1992 
and 41 cases involving 58 people were placed on file for 
investigation, of which 19 cases were extraordinarily serious 
and four people were involved in vitally important cases. Direct 
economic losses amounting to 2.29 million yuan were recovered 
for the state. Wang Shengping and Cai Yongji from the Hainan 
Xinhua Accountants' Office accepted bribes to issue a false 
report on asset examination for a certain investment group in 
Hainan to the effect that the said "group had a paid-up capital 
of $10 million," with which the group conducted an exceptionally 
big swindle causing extremely serious consequences. Apart from 
investigating and affixing criminal responsibility to the 
abovementioned two defendants, the relevant procuratorial 
department also checked and acted on the persons in charge of 
the accountants' office for dereliction of duty and the case is 
now placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Actions 
taken by the procuratorial organs to identify and deal with 
criminal cases of "infringing on rights" and dereliction of 
duties according to the law have played a significant role in 
intensifying the building of socialist democracy and legal 
system, punishing corruption, promoting the diligent and honest 
performance of official duties, and safeguarding and 
facilitating the establishment and development of a market 
economy. 
  -- Procuratorial work in respect of prisons. 
Procuratorial departments in charge of prisons at all levels 
across the province placed the supervision of law enforcement in 
a primary position, accepted cases involving 34 recidivists, and 
instituted legal proceedings against them according to the law. 
Actions against the law which involved 2,726 prisoners serving 
sentences in jails for reeducation through labor were corrected 
in accordance with the law. Of these, 1,797 people had been 
detained for longer terms and 20 people were detained without 
testimony. There was a total of 77 instances of potentially 
dangerous conditions in some of the detention centers and 
measures were taken to correct them. Besides, 43 cases of 
indictments or appeals initiated by detainees or their families 
were also handled. 
  -- Procuratorial work in respect of indictments and 
appeals. Procuratorial departments continued to conduct 
activities of receiving the people in a civilized manner, 
persisted in practicing the system under which chief procurators 
personally attended to the letters and visits of the masses, and 
further enhanced the work of case reexamination. As a result, 
2,527 cases of indictments were accepted during the year of 
which 2,253 cases were handled either by direct hearing and 
giving replies to the persons who brought in the indictments, or 
by transferring their cases to the pertinent departments. 
  With regard to appeals, 525 cases were accepted and 516 were 
handled. The Provincial People's Procuratorate corrected the 
case of Chen Taixin, a people's deputy from Ledong County, for 
illegal detention and trial by the local public security bureau, 
thus safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the 
people's deputy, for which the provincial people's congress 
standing committee and the province's political science and law 
commission issued a special circular to affirm the correct 
handling of this case. 
  -- Procuratorial work in respect of civil and 
administrative affairs. While improving work, reinforcing 
strength, and straightening out relations in organs, 
procuratorial departments enthusiastically conducted work in 
case handling. During last year, 55 cases of lawsuits in civil 
and administrative affairs were accepted and opposition to 
undeniably wrong judgments and adjudications were lodged with 
the court according to the law, so that the verdicts of some of 
them were revised. Although the work started late, this 
supervisory function will become increasingly important under 
the market economy conditions. 
  -- Procuratorial work in respect of investigation, 
study, and information. Since last year, in light of the 
comparatively weak links in the procuratorial organs across the 
province in terms of investigation, study, and information, we 
started deepening the understanding of personnel and took 
powerful measures to change the situation so that greater 
improvements have been made in these aspects. We convened the 
first provincial symposium on the work of investigation and 
study in procuratorial departments and proposed the missions, 
demands, and measures for enhancing the work. The Provincial 
People's Procuratorate began publishing the periodical JIANCHA 
XIN SHIDAI [NEW ERA OF PROCURATORIAL WORK], which opened up a 
new realm for the enhancement of investigation and study. In 
addition, the procuratorate also started the first training 
class on procuratorial information and conducted activities on 
appraisal through comparison to elect advanced units and fine 
workers in the information business. Thanks to the serious 
attention paid to the work, a good atmosphere in investigation 
and study is taking shape in the procuratorial organs across the 
province so that information work has been further strengthened. 
<H5>  IV. Sticking to the Principle of "Administering </H5>
Procuratorates Strictly" and Taking Firm Control of Building a 
Contingent of Procuratorial Personnel 
  Since last year, procuratorial organs at all levels across 
the province have conscientiously organized the study of central 
documents concerning the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the third 
volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," with a view to 
arming the minds of the vast number of cadres and policemen with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. In particular, while carrying out the 
instructions and guidelines of the central authorities on the 
anticorruption struggle, we intensified the anticorruption work 
within our ranks so that all personnel were tested and tempered 
in the in-depth struggle. With regard to the building of our 
ranks, in the main we fulfilled the following tasks: First, we 
held a provincial meeting on political work to review and sum up 
the ideological and political work performed in the 
procuratorial organs in the past few years and assigns the tasks 
ahead. Second, we completed the reelection work smoothly 
whereby the average age of chief procurators at all levels was 
reduced and their cultural and professional standards were 
enhanced. Third, with the approval of the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate and the provincial party committee, the pilot work 
for the "Regulations on Prosecutors" was conducted throughout 
the province. Fourth, we put into serious practice the 
"Decisions on Launching a Law Enforcement Activity Among the 
Procuratorial Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents 
of enforcing the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and 
civilized way, which was adopted in the second provincial 
procuratorial work meeting last year. As a result, the 
consciousness of the vast number of cadres and policemen on the 
honest and diligent performance of their duties, strict 
observation of law and discipline, and their standards of law 
enforcement were enhanced to some extent. Fifth, we conducted 
conscientious education on opposing corruption and encouraging 
honesty among the cadres and policemen. Meanwhile, cadres at 
and above section head level earnestly made self examinations 
and self rectification in accordance with the five requirements 
set by the central authorities. Sixth, we reinforced the 
training of cadres and policemen, through which 266 cadres were 
trained in six training classes sponsored by pertinent business 
departments of the provincial people's procuratorate. Ten 
cadres participated in the training course at the Central 
Prosecutor Management College and 240 cadres studied in courses 
for professional diplomas. 
  Deputies, although certain achievements were attained in the 
province's procuratorial work in 1993, there were still some 
problems and weak links in our work. Apart from those mentioned 
above, there was also the problem of uneven development in work. 
In some places where working conditions were more or less the 
same, the work results were quite different owing to the varying 
degrees of effort they had made. In the anticorruption 
struggle, they failed to reap prominent results in checking and 
dealing with the criminal cases of corruption and bribery in 
party and government organs, judicial departments, law 
enforcement departments, and economic management departments 
according to the requirements of the central authorities. In 
some areas, the tasks of pursuing and capturing escaped 
criminals and screening accumulated economic crimes were still 
extremely arduous. The conditions of office buildings used by 
the procuratorial organs and the facilities for law enforcement 
also await urgent improvement. Political education, 
professional training, and education on opposing corruption and 
encouraging honesty still need to be repeatedly deepened and 
strengthened. 
  Deputies, 
  The year 1994 is one in which reform will be accelerated in 
China. It is also a year full of hope. As the reform intensity 
in the Hainan Special Economic Region will be increased, the 
development tasks will be even heavier. The new situation has 
set still higher demands on our procuratorial work. Regarding 
the work in 1994, we held a provincial conference of chief 
procurators in early January this year to sum up our work 
conscientiously, analyze the situation, unify thinking, and 
clearly define our missions. Our general guiding idea is: This 
year, procuratorial organs at all levels across the province 
should put into effect seriously the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, and the Second Session of the First Hainan 
Provincial People's Congress, conscientiously study the third 
volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," persistently 
seek guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, stick to the principle 
of "doing two types of work simultaneously and attaching equal 
importance to both," further intensify the functions of law 
inspection, strictly enforce the law, take firm control of case 
handling, and resolutely crack down on various criminal 
activities, to create a favorable legal environment for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction in our province and 
provide a guarantee for the establishment and development of a 
socialist market economy structure. 
  We must carry out the anticorruption struggle profoundly and 
concentrate our efforts on investigating and dealing with major 
important cases. The province's procuratorial organs at all 
levels should persistently take punishing economic crime, 
including corruption, bribery, and so on, as the most important 
and direct service rendered to economic construction, make 
mental preparations for waging a protracted battle, and focus 
the work on investigating and dealing with such economic crimes 
as corruption, bribery, and so on committed by party and 
government organs, judicial departments, law enforcement 
departments, economic management departments, as well as their 
personnel. New breakthroughs should be made in the area of 
investigating and dealing with major important cases. We must 
seriously investigate and deal with criminal cases involving 
legal persons by selecting typical examples, breaking through 
key points and, in accordance with the law, investigating and 
ferreting out various criminal activities including offering 
bribes, taking bribes, smuggling, evading taxes, refusing to pay 
taxes, making false tax reports, forging bogus registered 
trademarks, and so on in organs, organizations, enterprises, and 
institutions. At the same time, we must pay serious attention 
to unearthing and investigating other crimes of accepting 
bribes, practicing favoritism, committing irregularities, 
neglecting official duties, and so on committed by government 
workers in connection with the crimes of legal persons. In light 
of the characteristics in our province, we must also make 
serious investigation into the criminal cases committed in 
transfers of land, those major important cases in particular, 
and the criminal activities of using public funds to engage in 
land, stock, and property speculation, to further the 
anticorruption struggle in our province in a penetrating way. 
  We must continue to adhere to the principle of cracking down 
on serious criminal activities rigorously and rapidly in 
accordance with the law. Under the conditions of practicing a 
market economy, political and social stability is an essential 
guarantee and prerequisite for pushing forward reform and 
development. The social security in our province at present is 
still very grim, which is why procuratorial organs at all levels 
throughout the province must continue to deal heavy blows 
against serious criminal activities, stick to the principle of 
handling cases in a rigorous and rapid manner, as well as the 
principle of "two basic points" according to the law, and take 
speedy action in arresting and prosecuting lest we should bungle 
the chance of winning a battle in the procuratorial work domain. 
We must also coordinate with public security organs and courts 
in the unified action of the entire province to crack down on 
criminal activities, particularly on those committed using 
firearms and positively participate in the struggle of specific 
operations and rectification of disorder in some key areas as 
organized by various localities according to actual local 
conditions. Combining this task with the handling of cases, we 
must put into practice comprehensively various measures for the 
overall control of social security in procuratorial work, 
formulating detailed rules and regulations for the 
implementation of "Several Stipulations on Practicing a 
Leadership Responsibility System in the Overall Control of 
Social Security" promulgated by the central authorities, so that 
leading cadres in procuratorial organs at all levels will really 
assume their responsibilities to maintain law and order in their 
own localities. 
  We must intensify supervision over law enforcement and 
conduct procuratorial business in a comprehensive way. While 
paying attention to performing strict law enforcement in 
procuratorial departments, we should also exercise supervision 
over other departments in respect of law enforcement and, 
through investigating and dealing with cases that were not 
handled with strict legal procedures and through rectifying 
activities in violation of laws, supervise and urge other 
departments to enforce laws rigorously to maintain the unity of 
state laws and ensure their correct implementation. 
  We must make further efforts to augment the building of the 
procuratorial ranks with stress on the trial implementation of 
the "Regulations on Prosecutors" and the in-depth activities of 
enforcing laws in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized 
way; repeatedly enhance the political and professional standards 
of the vast number of cadres and policemen; and work hard to 
build a contingent of procuratorial personnel who are powerful 
politically, competent professionally, strict in discipline, and 
good in style, in a bid to make new contributions to 
accelerating the development of a socialist market economy and 
the drive for modernization in our province. 
  I hereby present the above report to you for your 
examination 
and approval.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou on Monday [23 May] hailed a group of investigators and 
prosecutors in charge of unraveling the scandal surrounding the 
March 1 elections for city and county council speakers and 
deputy speakers, and encouraged them to continue playing an 
active role in preventing a similar occurrence in upcoming local 
elections. 
  "History will make it known that we're the terminators of 
graft and vote bribery," Ma said in a speech to the group. 
  As of Sunday, 398 suspects, including 13 speakers, nine 
deputy speakers, and 184 councilors -- a third of all sitting 
councilors -- had been charged for either buying votes or 
accepting bribes in the elections for speakers and deputy 
speakers of the 23 county and city councils. 
  The ruling Kuomintang won all speaker and deputy speaker 
seats. 
  Ma asked the group to keep rooting out corruption to make 
sure the June and July elections for village and township chiefs 
will be clean. 
  Meanwhile, the prosecutor's office in the central city of 
Taichung charged Councilors Chen Jen-hsun, Chen Jui-teh and Ho 
Wen-hai with accepting bribes worth between NT$7 million and 
NT$7.4 million (US$261,200-US$276,120) from Speaker Kuo 
Yen-sheng in exchange for their votes in the March 1 election. 
  The prosecutor recommended 30 months in jail for the three 
defendants if they are found guilty. 
  Twenty-nine people have now been charged with graft 
surrounding the Taichung City Council election.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance is 
cautiously assessing the feasibility of allowing overseas 
branches of Taiwan banks to do business with overseas branches 
of mainland Chinese banks, Vice Finance Minister Li Chung-ying 
said Monday [22 May]. 
  Li made the statement at a seminar on Mainland China's 
economic and financial affairs, which was jointly sponsored by 
the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and the banking 
institute. 
  Under the proposal, however, direct links between Taiwan 
banks and mainland Chinese banks would still be banned. 
  The vice minister noted that five domestic banks -- Hua Nan 
Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, Chang Hwa Commercial 
Bank, Chiao Tung Bank, and the International Commercial Bank of 
China -- have applied to the ministry to do business with 
overseas branches of mainland banks. 
  The banks must submit information concerning what the 
relationship between their overseas branches and overseas 
mainland banks would be, including agreeing to a place outside 
of Taiwan, Mainland China, or Hong Kong where legal disputes 
could be settled. 
  Hua Nan Bank, which maintains a branch in Hong Kong, is very 
likely to become the first Taiwan bank to forge a cooperative 
relationship with mainland counterparts, including the Bank of 
China, once its application is approved by the ministry, Li 
elaborated. 
  MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian said that increased 
cross-Strait banking ties would expand funding channels for 
Taiwan investors on the mainland, but that whether the proposal 
gets final approval is dependent on the extent to which it would 
help make Taiwan more competitive and how it would affect 
indirect cross-Strait trade.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Taiwan's balance of 
payments has changed structurally, with the current account 
surplus declining while capital inflow is beginning to outpace 
capital outflow, finance officials said Tuesday [24 May]. 
  Taiwan saw a net capital inflow of more than U.S.$1 billion 
in the first quarter of this year, the first favorable balance 
in its capital account since 1988, according to preliminary 
statistics compiled by the Central Bank of China (CBC). 
  Taiwan's current account surplus, however, dropped to a 
13-year low of about U.S.$200 million during the January-March 
period mainly because of a sharp decline in the merchandise 
trade surplus, the CBC said. 
  It will release the exact figures of the country's balance 
of 
payments for the first quarter of 1994 later this week. 
  CBC officials said the capital account surplus indicates 
that 
foreign capital movement has begun to influence Taiwan's balance 
of payments as a result of its financial liberalization and 
internationalization policy. 
  Meanwhile, the officials said, the drop in the current 
account surplus reflects structural changes in the local 
economy. Taiwan has gradually lost export competitiveness, 
particularly in labor-intensive industries, and thus no longer 
enjoys a huge trade surplus. Taiwan's foreign trade surplus 
totaled only U.S.$240 million during the three-month period. 
  The balance of payments measure records all of a country's 
economic transactions with the rest of the world during a 
specified period of time. It is usually divided into the 
capital account, which records short and long-term capital 
flows, and the current account, which records merchandise and 
service trade as well as unrequited transfers. 
  The balance of payments is an effective measure to monitor a 
country's external trade and financial relations. 
  Taiwan consistently registered net capital outflows between 
1987 and 1993 as local companies were making massive investments 
abroad because of the worsening investment climate here. The 
capital account deficit reached a record U.S.$5.6 billion in the 
fourth quarter of 1992. 
  The trend reversed itself in the first quarter of this year. 
An influx of "hot money" for investment in the local stock 
market in January and February as well as a slowdown in direct 
overseas investments resulted in a net capital inflow of more 
than US$10 billion during the period. 
  Thanks to its huge current account surplus, Taiwan saw its 
balance of payments end up in the black between 1981 and 1991. 
It registered a rare U.S.$639 million deficit in its 
international balance sheet in 1992, but again chalked up a 
U.S.$1.45 billion surplus last year. 
  The balance of payments surplus is also expected to exceed 
U.S.$1 billion in the first quarter of 1994 due to a combination 
of factors, including net capital inflow, slower increases in 
overseas travel bills and increases in interest income from the 
country's huge foreign exchange reserves, the officials noted.

  [Text] Brisbane, May 23 (CNA) -- Relations between the 
Republic of China [ROC] and Australia's opposition Liberal Party 
should improve in the long term following a change in the 
leadership of the party, the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office 
(TECO) in Canberra said Monday [23 May]. 
  Alexander Downer, formerly shadow treasurer under the 
leadership of John Hewson, on Monday defeated his boss by a vote 
of 43 to 36 to become the new leader of the liberals. 
  At a press conference in Canberra today, the 42-year-old 
Downer pledged a fresh start for the oppostion. 
  "I pledge myself to do everything I can to restore hope and 
a 
bright future to Australia," he said. 
  Downer's father was a minister under the late prime minister 
Richard Menzies. 
  TECO Representative Francias Li said both Hewson and Downer 
are friendly to the ROC. They both visited Taiwan in March 1991 
and were impressed by the progress they saw there, he said. 
  Li said many of Downer's supporters either have visited 
Taiwan or are members of the Australia-Taiwan parliamentary 
group in Canberra. The group now has 86 members, next only to 
the Australia-U.S. parliamentary group in terms of participation. 
  Li said the election of Downer to head the Liberal Party was 
a positive occurrence for the ROC. "I believe our relations 
with the opposition will further improve," he said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- A group of Latin American 
ambassadors stationed in Taipei Tuesday [24 May] urged the 
Republic of China [ROC] to encourage its businessmen to increase 
investment in their countries. 
  The envoys made the call during a seminar on relations 
between the ROC and Latin American countries sponsored by 
Legislator Cheng Chien-jen of the ruling Kuomintang. 
  The ROC has shared long-term friendship with Central 
American 
countries. Many of the 29 countries with which it maintains 
formal diplomatic ties are located in Central America. Due in 
part to geographical distance, commercial exchanges between 
Taiwan and the region, however, remain limited. 
  Paraguayan Ambassador Miguel Angel Solano-Lopez Casco said 
he 
regrets that many Taiwan companies, while ignoring his call for 
investing in his country, have made large investments in 
Mainland China and other countries or areas with which Taiwan 
does not have diplomatic ties. 
  Paraguay is the only South American country that 
diplomatically recognizes Taiwan. Lopez said Paraguay not only 
hopes to promote political ties with the ROC but also wants to 
strengthen bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  Taiwan businessmen's overseas investment activities do not 
seem to comply with the ROC Government's diplomatic policy, 
Lopez noted. 
  Speaking at the same occasion, Salvadoran Ambassador David 
Ernesto Panama [name as received] said mutual interests are key 
to maintaining longstanding diplomatic ties. 
  Panama said he appreciates all the assistance the ROC has 
given his country over the past years. He pointed out that his 
country has also suffered from its close ties with Taiwan, 
saying that Mainland China has boycotted his country's 
activities in the United Nations and secretly supported leftists 
in El Salvador. 
  Panama said he is willing to play the role of "go-between" 
to 
help prospective Taiwan investors launch new ventures in his 
country. "I also hope the ROC Government can actively encourage 
local businessmen to invest in El Salvador," he added. 
  Ambassadors from other Central American countries, including 
the Dominican Republic and Honduras, also attended the seminar.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC] 
and Guatemala signed a vocational training technical cooperation 
agreement Tuesday [24 May] to strengthen bilateral vocational 
training between the two countries. 
  Chairman of Council of Labor Affairs Chao Shou-po and 
Guatemalan Labor Affairs Minister Gladys Anabela Morfin Mancilla 
signed the agreement in Taipei on behalf of their two 
governments. 
  The agreement is the first vocational training agreement the 
ROC has signed with a foreign country, Chao said. 
  Since June 1992, the ROC Government has assisted Guatemala 
in 
setting up vocational training centers in the Central American 
country, Chao said. He added that the centers have trained many 
technical experts during the past two years. 
  Taiwan has promoted overseas vocational training technical 
cooperation programs since 1990 and is assisting in the training 
of technical manpower to upgrade the industrial level of 
friendly developing countries, Chao said. 
  Over the past three years, a total of 30 foreign countries 
have sent 257 personnel to the island for training and the 
government has established vocational training centers in the 
Philippines, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan and the Czech 
Republic on Monday [23 May] entered into a business arbitration 
agreement. 
  Wang Ling-lin, secretary-general of the Republic of China 
[ROC] Business Arbitration Association, and Dr. Svetozar Hanak, 
director of the Arbitration Court of the Czech Confederation of 
Commerce and Industry, inked the pact at a ceremony at the Grand 
Hyatt Taipei in the afternoon. 
  Dr. Hanak also delivered a keynote speech on the Czech 
arbitration system and trade-related rules and regulations. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Wang said the accord will 
help settle the growing number of trade disputes between the two 
countries arising from increased trade ties. 
  Trade ties between Taiwan and East Europe have been on the 
rise. Statistics show that two-way trade totaled US$180 million 
in the first quarter, up 23 percent from the year earlier. 
  This is the second business arbitration agreement Taiwan has 
signed with an East European country, Wang noted. 
  The association, which has inked such agreements with 12 
countries, including the United States, Japan, and Hungary, 
wants to sign similar pacts with Britain, Austria, Singapore, 
and Vietnam this year, he pointed out.

International Inc. to discuss future cooperation prospects 
Monday [23 May]. 
  Tang, who led a four-man group here Saturday, said that the

its suppliers, introduce the aviation and space development 
projects in Taiwan, and seek technology transfers from Grumman. 
  Tang said that he met with two Grumman suppliers in Long 
Island in the afternoon. The two suppliers showed keen interest 
in proposed cooperation between Taiwan and Grumman. 
  Tang and his group will meet again with Grumman officials 
Tuesday. Taiwan is reportedly most concerned about getting 
technology transfers from the company if any deals are made. 
They are also working to allow Taiwan companies to sell parts 
and components to Grumman. 
  Tang and his group will travel to California later this week 
before going home in early June.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- The state-run China Steel 
Corp. on Tuesday [24 May] entered into a shareholders agreement 
with the MEMC Co. of the United States, with both sides pledging 
to form a joint venture to produce wafers for use in integrated 
circuits (IC). 
  MEMC, a subsidiary of Germany's Huls Group, is the world's 
second largest wafer manufacturer. 
  Inking the document were MEMC Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Robert M. Sandfort, China Steel's chairman Wang 
Chung-Yu, President Hu Ting-wu of the China Development Corp. 
and Vice President Li Ming-chi of Chiao Tung Bank. 
  Under the agreement, the proposed joint business will have 
an 
aggregate investment of NT [New Taiwan] $4.85 billion 
(U.S.$180.29 million), of which a 45 percent stake will go to 
MEMC, 35 percent to China Steel, and 10 percent each to the 
China Development Corp. and Chiao Tung Bank. 
  Paid-in capital will amount to NT$2 billion (U.S.$74.34 
million), and the remaining NT$2.85 billion (U.S.$105.95 
million) will come from a bank loan. 
  Speaking at the signing ceremony, Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said that the agreement will usher in a new era for 
the development of Taiwan's IC industry, whose key material -- 
wafers -- are all imported. 
  Taiwan imports about NT$3 billion (U.S.$111.52 million) 
worth 
of wafers annually, of which MEMC accounts for a 30 percent 
market share, Chiang noted. 
  The planned investment by the Missouri-based company will 
certainly help upgrade the industrial base here and sharpen 
Taiwan's competitive edge in worldwide markets, he pointed out. 
  Construction of the proposed wafer factory, to be located at 
the Hsinchu science-based industrial park, is expected to be 
completed in two years, while commercialized production is 
scheduled to begin in 1997. 
  The factory's annual output is set at 40 million square 
inches in the initial stage and could expand to 60 million 
square inches to meet growing market demand.

  [Text] Kaohsiung, May 23 (CNA) -- The Kaohsiung-based 
Taiwan Cuttlefish Association confirmed Monday [23 May] that the 
fishing vessel attacked by the Argentine Navy on Friday off 
Argentina's east coast was the Kaohsiung-based Chin Yuan Hsing. 
  The 800-ton boat was reportedly sunk off the coast of San 
Julian after being hit by machine-gun and cannon fire. The 
Argentine Navy had been trying to get the Chin Yuan Hsing to 
stop so that it could be inspected after it was caught illegally 
poaching within Argentine waters. 
  The 30-odd crewmembers were rescued by another Taiwan 
fishing 
vessel, the Chin Chuan Hsing, which was also operating off the 
coast of San Julian when the incident occurred. 
  The full story behind the attack is still under 
investigation, the association said, adding that the current 
situation of the crewmembers was unclear because of 
communication difficulties resulting from poor weather 
conditions in the Southwest Atlantic. 
  Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture and Taiwan Fishery 
Representatives called on local fishing boats to respect 
relevant laws and regulatons set by foreign governments when 
fishing in foreign waters to prevent the recurrence of such 
incidents.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Aiming to further introduce 
[as received] production costs as they seek to sharpen their 
competitive edge on the international market, some of the 
world's major computer firms, including IBM, Apple, Compaq, and 
Hewlett Packard, have decided to increase purchases of locally 
made computer products. 
  Many leading computer companies have set up international 
procurement offices here to facilitate purchases of Taiwan-made 
computer products as those products have become more competitive 
internationally, business sources said. 
  In the past, IBM has always been the leading foreign buyer 
of 
computer products in Taiwan. Last year alone, it bought US$382 
million worth of Taiwan-made computer products, and the figure 
is expected to further grow this year, an executive at the IBM 
Taiwan corporation said. 
  Apple Computer Inc., which will double its purchases here to 
US$400 million-US$500 million to make it the largest foreign 
buyer of computer products this year, mostly will purchase 
family-use computers, monitors, motherboards, notebook 
computers, and semiconductors, said Cheng Hung-yu, manager of 
the Apple Taiwan branch. 
  Apple's Taipei Procurement Office will also be expanded to 
handle purchases in Mainland China and Hong Kong, Cheng added. 
  Another active foreign buyer, Hewlett Packard, will also 
increase purchases here, purchase manager Chan Chiu-ming said. 
  Hewlett Packard bought US$60 million worth of Taiwan 
computer 
products in 1992 and US$90 million in goods last year. The 
figure is expected to set a new high of US$100 million this 
year, Chan predicted. 
  In addition to monitors and rectifiers, Hewlett Packard will 
increase purchases of motherboards this year, Chan said, citing 
the flexibility and advanced know-how of Taiwan computer makers 
as the main reasons behind the increased purchases. 
  And although Compaq has only bought less than US$100 million 
worth of Taiwan computer products in each of the past three 
years in that figure may swell markedly to US$300 million this 
year, Sun Yung-hsiang, managing director at Compaq Taiwan branch 
office, said.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- Economics Minister P.K. 
Chiang Tuesday [24 May] decorated the outgoing director of the 
German Trade Office Juergen Franzen for promoting trade and 
economic ties between Taiwan and Germany. 
  Chiang said at the award ceremony that Franzen has 
contributed a great deal to trade relations between the two 
nations during his eight-year term as director. 
  Trade between Taiwan and Germany hit U.S.$7.72 billion in 
1993. 
  Chiang said Franzen will be leaving for Singapore in June to 
serve as delegate of the German Industry and Commerce for the 
Asia Pacific region and Asian director and coordinator of the 
Asia Pacific Committee of German Business. He hoped that 
Franzen will continue to promote trade between the two nations 
and that bilateral trade would hit U.S.$10 billion soon. 
  Franzen recalled the time when he first came to Taiwan in 
1975 as a student. He said that he has witnessed the rapid 
economic growth of Taiwan and seen ties between Taiwan and 
Germany go from distant to close over the past two decades. 
  German Ambassador to Sri Lanka Klaus Franke will assume 
Franzen's post in June.

  [Text] Taipei, May 24 (CNA) -- A powerful earthquake 
measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale rocked Taiwan Tuesday [24 
May], but no casualties or damage were reported. 
  The Central Weather Bureau said the tremor occurred at 12 
a.m. (0400 GMT Tuesday) and shook high-rise buildings across the 
island. 
  Its epicenter was located 103.8 kilometers (64.8 miles) east 
of the eastern city of Hualien at a depth of 2.5 kilometers 
(1.56 miles), the bureau said. 
  Several aftershocks were also felt throughout the island 
after the quake. On Monday afternoon, two major quakes and 
several aftershocks also hit the island. 
  The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause 
severe damage in a populated area.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
trade official said here today that China will import 1,000 
billion U.S. Dollars worth of goods in the next seven years. 
  The country's import value in 1993 amounted to 104 billion 
U.S. dollars, said Zheng Silin, vice minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation, at the '94 China Trade Investment 
Conference which opened in Hong Kong today. 
  He admitted that China had a trade deficit of 12 billion 
U.S. 
dollars last year, noting this was led by a big growth of import 
as a result of rapid economic development in China. 
  China's basic policy for foreign trade is to strike a 
balance 
between import and export provided it has necessary foreign 
reserve, the vice minister said. 
  So far, China ranks in the world as the 11th largest trader 
with a total import and export value of 195.8 billion U.S. 
dollars last year. 
  The country has approved 170,000 enterprises built in the 
forms of joint venture, cooperation or exclusive overseas 
investment. The actual foreign investment used in China 
surpassed 60 billion U.S. dollars. 
  Starting from this year, Zheng said, China began to carry 
out 
a series of reforms in the fields of taxation, monetary, foreign 
exchange management and foreign trade. This demonstrates a 
breakthrough in the reform of China's economic mechanism and 
will be of a far-reaching significance in setting up a socialist 
market economy, Zheng said. 
  He reiterated that China will take foreign investors into 
full consideration in its economic reform and strike to create 
an investment climate wherein enterprises operate in 
international norms.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
official in Hong Kong said today that China expects to resolve 
the overall financing for the Hong Kong new airport at an early 
date. 
  A settlement of the financial issue will help speed up 
construction on the airport projects, said Zhang Junsheng, 
deputy director of the XINHUA News Agency Hong Kong branch, 
after attending the opening ceremony of a Chinese trade fair 
here today. 
  The Chinese side has stated its opinion at the Sino-British 
Airport Committee meeting last week and expected the British 
side to give it a careful consideration, he said. 
  Both sides should accord with the memorandum of 
understanding 
on the construction of the Hong Kong new airport and reach an 
agreement on the financial plan, he added. 
  China has always supported the construction of an airport in 
Hong Kong and hopes to see it completed in time and up to 
quality, he said, adding that China is not responsible for the 
delay of the airport construction.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Two more Airport Core 
Program (ACP) contracts have been awarded by the government, 
bringing the total value of construction contracts awarded for 
the ACP to 48.4 billion H.K. dollars (6.2 billion U.S. dollars). 
  The government information service announced today that the 
two newly-approved contracts cover a pumping station and a 
microwave link relay station to serve the new airport at Chek 
Lap Kok. 
  The two projects, with a total value of over 64.3 million 
H.K. dollars (8.2 million U.S. dollars), will start soon for 
completion in early 1996 and mid-1995 respectively. 
  The award of those two contracts bring to 42 the total 
number 
of ACP contracts awarded by the government, with a total value 
of more than 32 billion H.K. dollars (4.1 billion U.S. dollars). 
  Meanwhile, the provisional airport authority has awarded six 
construction contracts valued at 10.7 billion H.K. dollars (1.37 
billion U.S. dollars), and the Western Harbor Tunnel Company 
Limited awarded a contract worth 5.7 billion H.K. dollars 
(730,000 U.S. dollars). 
  Taking all the three sectors together, the total value of 
construction contracts awarded for the ACP is 48.4 billion H.K. 
dollars (6.2 billion U.S. dollars), according to the Government 
Information Service.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] China has given tacit approval to the Government's 
latest request for funds for airport-related projects, giving 
another strong signal of an end to the two-year wrangle over how 
to finance the Chek Lap Kok plan. 
  In a departure from previous strategy, Chinese officials 
have 
refrained from criticising the Government attempt to seek more 
than $1 billion from legislators for airport and rail projects. 
A senior mainland official admitted they had adopted pragmatism 
and acknowledged the "difficulties" raised by the British side 
over the urgent need for funds to keep the projects going. 
  "We hope to be more pragmatic and show the spirit of mutual 
accommodation to strive for an early accord," he said. 
  This is despite early statements made by the Chinese that 
the 
Government should not seek funds while the diplomatic talks on 
the overall financial arrangements were still underway. "Our 
major concern now is to secure a full agreement as soon as 
possible," said the official. 
  Just one day after the Airport Committee meeting, the 
Government said on Saturday it would seek funds from the 
Legislative Council to build an immersed tunnel across the 
railway link. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod was quoted 
as saying yesterday the Government planned to seek another "huge 
amount of funds" related to the airport project from lawmakers 
before the end of the current Legco session. 
  At a meeting with two legislators from the United Democrats 
and Meeting Point, he also reportedly said that the 
administration might publicise details of its fourth financing 
proposal which was handed to the Chinese side in February. 
  It is understood the next funding request will mainly cover 
the construction of the superstructure of the passenger 
terminal, estimated at more than $10 billion. The Provisional 
Airport Authority has already completed the design of the 
terminal and it is necessary for construction to go ahead. 
  The Government is hoping that talks at the Airport Committee 
could "go parallel" with construction of the 
multi-billion-dollar project in order to minimise any delay. 
  A deputy director of XINHUA (the New China News Agency), 
Zhang Junsheng, yesterday pressed the British side for a quick 
solution to the airport issue claiming problems were "not on the 
Chinese side". 
  "We, on our part, hope very much that there could be a 
concise solution to the new airport problem. The earlier we can 
reach an overall solution on the financing package, the more 
conducive it would be to the new airport construction."

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Teng Yen-erh (6772 </F>
1750 0334): "Hong Kong SAR Preliminary Work Committee Discusses 
Treason, Other Legal Terms"] 
  [Text] The Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] Legal Group 
has begun holding a three-day meeting today in Beijing. At 
today's session, the group discussed 17 criminal laws currently 
being used in Hong Kong, and initially thought that, except some 
terms which must be changed, they can generally be used after 
1997. 
  During the three-day meeting, the legal group will discuss 
more than 50 relevant judicial, law enforcement, and 
administrative laws. After the meeting today, Li Fu-shan, the 
group's convener from the Hong Kong side, said that today the 
group discussed 17 clauses which are all related to criminal 
laws, and that the group thought the original laws should remain 
unchanged as much as possible -- "it is better to stay put than 
make a bad move" -- so as to realize Hong Kong's stability and 
prosperity and keep from affecting the Hong Kong people's life 
and confidence. 
  He said that the group discussed 17 clauses and thought they 
are very satisfactory, that -- except for some terms like the 
"governor of Hong Kong," which must be changed -- they can 
generally be maintained, but the group did not consider the 
concrete problem of how to amend them. 
  He said that, among the clauses discussed today were the 
corruption prevention ordinance and the criminal laws in Chapter 
200 of the Hong Kong law. Chapter 200 is about treason and the 
crime of instigating rebellion. The group thought that the 
chapter is already compact and detailed and the group was 
inclined to simply make some adjustments to the wording. 
Today's session did not discuss Article 23 of the Basic Law, an 
article on secessionist activity not included in Chapter 200. 
  Shao Tianren, the legal group's convener from the Chinese 
side, said that, based on the demand of Article 8 of the Basic 
Law, the group is keeping the original laws of Hong Kong as much 
as possible, and that, as long as they do not contradict the 
Basic Law, they can be adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region [SAR]. But he said that some 
problems within the clauses must still be further studied, 
including the way to handle terms and wordings that are 
different from the Basic Law. Some of the original laws come 
from the British Commonwealth or from Britain, and some powers, 
such as Hong Kong Legislative Council's power, come from British 
laws, and how they should be handled is a matter that must be 
looked into and discussions must be carried out to find a 
solution. 
  He said that the legal group examined 53 clauses at the 
previous two rounds of meetings. During the first round, eight 
clauses were discussed, and, during the second round, 45 clauses 
were examined. Today's session made very quick progress, looking 
at a total of 17 clauses. 
  Tan Yao-tsung, member of the legal group from the Hong Kong 
side, thought that the relevant clause on treason can generally 
continue to be used after some terms have been amended, because 
Britain is ruled by a constitutional monarchy, and, whether we 
are discussing the British Government or British sovereignty, 
they both belong to the Queen, and Chapter 200 of Hong Kong Law 
follows this spirit. After 1997, Hong Kong will become a special 
administrative region under Chinese sovereignty, and this clause 
should be amended according to the actual conditions, for 
example, some wording must be changed to read "central 
government."

  [Text] The influential Hong Kong General Chamber of 
Commerce yesterday signalled its alliance with forces opposed to 
the Governor's political reform package. 
  The chamber's chairman, William Fung, criticised Chris 
Patten's plan to give all 2.7 million workers a second vote in 
functional constituencies, and to scrap block voting by 
companies. 
  "We felt that the administration's proposals to create new, 
large, functional constituencies, representing an electorate of 
some 2.7 million from nine industrial and commercial sectors, to 
be a major departure from the concept and character of the 
existing functional constituencies," Fung said. 
  Jimmy McGregor, who represents the chamber in the 
Legislative 
Council but who was voted off its general committee last month, 
said Fung's statement was an example of bias as a result of 
business interests. 
  "It shows that the chamber is very much China-orientated 
politically, which is not surprising. So many members of the 
chamber have investments in China," he said. 
  Fung said the chamber believed that the nine new functional 
constituencies should retain the essential features -- 
representing specific interests of each group with a limited 
electorate -- of the existing 21 functional constituencies. 
Although McGregor supports Patten's proposals on the new 
functional constituencies, he had reservations. 
  "I have always supported [the idea] that the nine new 
functional constituencies have to be aligned with the existing 
21 functional constituencies," he said. 
  At the last elections in 1991, only about 100,000 people 
were 
allowed to elect members to functional constituencies. One 
constituency is made up of 36 local councillors. A former 
representative, Gilbert Leung, was jailed for vote buying. 
  Functional constituencies will make up half the 60 seats in 
the legislature next year. Patten believes widening the 
electorate will make legislators more accountable to public 
opinion but China has accused him of trying to introduce direct 
elections by the back door. A government spokesman denied this, 
saying: "Every independent test of the Governor's proposals, be 
they by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee 
or independent legal experts who have given evidence, have all 
said the Governor's proposals are within the framework of the 
Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. 
  "The Governor's proposals, including that on functional 
constituencies, have been considered by the Legislative Council 
on three occasions." 
  Fung also gave his opinion on the establishment of the Court 
of Final Appeal, delayed by the Legislative Council's refusal to 
endorse a Sino-British agreement. Fung said the chamber backed 
its establishment as soon as possible. 
  "Many members of the chamber would have preferred some 
discretion to be allowed on the number of overseas judges to 
rest with the court," Fung said. "Nevertheless, agreement has 
been reached in the Joint Liaison Group to restrict the number 
of overseas judges to one, and therefore this agreement must be 
honoured." 
  Fung said the court needed to be set up as soon as possible 
in order to build credibility before 1997 and to help maintain 
confidence in Hong Kong's position as a leading commercial and 
financial centre.

<F P=106> [Article by Chung Han (0022 3466): "Those Trying To Split </F>
and Weaken China Are Simply Mistaken in Their Calculations"] 
  [Text] As a component of its entire policy toward China 
and in accordance with its policy toward Hong Kong, the British 
Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee's report 
advocates confronting China on the issues of Tibet and Taiwan as 
well. 
<H5>  Aiming To Support the Independence of Tibet, Taiwan </H5>
  The Report quotes a 1943 British diplomatic document, 
saying: 
"The British Government has always been willing to recognize 
China's suzerainty over Tibet; however, such recognition must be 
based on an understanding of Tibet's autonomy"; at the same 
time, the document maintained that Tibet should be allowed 
"fuller autonomy" when necessary, and proposed that the British 
Government "hold discussions on the issue of Tibet's right to 
self-determination" with its Chinese counterpart. Those who 
have a knowledge of politics see clearly that suzerainty and 
sovereignty are two entirely different concepts; the 
nationality-defined autonomous region within a sovereign country 
and the relations between a metropolis and its vassal are 
basically different. The so-called recognition of China's 
"suzerainty" and Tibet's "fuller autonomy" referred to in the 
document is precisely meant to violate China's sovereignty, so 
that Tibet would leave the Chinese Government's jurisdiction and 
realize its independence in disguise under the pretext of 
"autonomy." The reason why the British Parliament shows such 
extraordinary concern over Tibet lies -- just as the report says 
-- in "the historical ties between Britain and Tibet." Such 
"ties" actually stem from the shameful history of Britain's 
invasion of China's Tibet and its intervention in Tibetan 
affairs. Regrettably, the British have the guts to glorify 
themselves with that incident. Back in 1888 and 1903, when 
Britain met with strong resistance in its invasion of Tibet, 
Britain changed its strategy and took the goal of separating 
Tibet from China. In 1907, when imperial Russia signed the 
"Treaty on the British-Russian Alliance," which aimed to contend 
for Central Asia, it had -- for the first time in history -- 
misrepresented China's sovereignty over Tibet and changed it 
into "suzerainty." At the Simla Conference in 1913, with 
participation of British and Tibetan delegates, the British 
Government required the Chinese Government to recognize the 
"autonomy of outer Tibet (including Tibet and western Sikang)," 
and "refrain from intervening in its internal affairs," with the 
effect of changing China's sovereignty over Tibet into 
suzerainty. Thanks to the strong opposition of the Chinese 
Government, the British attempt to sever Tibet from China was 
never successful. This shows that the British Parliamentary 
Foreign Affairs Select Committee is actually playing the same 
old tune and Britain has never given up its effort to separate 
Tibet from China. The so-called "violation of human rights in 
Tibet and threats to Tibetan cultural and religious 
characteristics" are nothing but pretexts. The report asserts, 
"a satisfactory solution to anxieties over the former (human 
rights violations) will be possible only by making progress in 
the latter (the Tibetan right to self-determination); this 
statement reveals the aforementioned British effort. If we 
examine Tibet's actual conditions, in the 43 years since its 
peaceful liberation, it has thoroughly abolished the extremely 
backward feudal serfdom, and, consequently, a million former 
serfs have taken the bright road of modernization. There is a 
world of difference between the present human rights conditions 
and those under the previous rule of slave owners in Tibet. The 
so-called "human rights violations" are obviously a deliberate 
exaggeration, and even a fabrication at that. 
  According to the report's own words, "signs of a thaw" in 
the 
"rigid" relations between the British Government and Taiwan have 
surfaced in recent years. In 1992, Britain appointed a diplomat 
to the general executive office of the Committee for 
British-Taiwan Trade (which was later changed into the British 
Office for Trade and Culture.) For the first time, the British 
Minister of Trade paid Taipei an official visit in 1993. Since 
Chris Patten's arrival in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong 
Government has kept one eye shut, given silent consent, and 
tolerated the Taiwan Authorities when they conduct activities in 
a governmental capacity as well as the high-sounding activities 
of Taiwan governmental organizations in Hong Kong. While 
expressing admiration for such tendencies, the report says, "it 
is suggested that the Government should reassess the status of 
the Taiwan office in Britain," "relax related restrictions," and 
even "propose closer ties between Westminster and Taiwan's 
Legislative Yuan." Furthermore, it expresses the hope that the 
international community "will help Taiwan pursue its goal of 
obtaining official status in the world." In actual fact, this 
aims to maintain and expand the separation of Taiwan and 
mainland China, tolerating and supporting Taiwan independence, 
and thus directly violating the position and commitment the 
British Government has openly taken on the "Taiwan issue." 
  British Strategy of Disintegration 
  The report links its position on the issues of Tibet, 
Taiwan, 
and Hong Kong, and it is not difficult to see that the truth 
behind all this can be summed up with but one word: 
"independence." Specifically, by supporting the independence of 
Tibet, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, Britain seeks to secure "Britain's 
essential interests" and protect and expand its influence. 
There are several differences: In Tibet, the British want to 
recover their lost influence; in Taiwan they want to expand 
their influence; and in Hong Kong, they want to protect and 
maintain their special vested interests. The British have bet 
their largest stake on Hong Kong. Because 1997 is approaching, 
Britain knows pretty well that its influence in Hong Kong is 
continuously dwindling. That being the case, it is 
simultaneously playing the "Tibet card" and the "Taiwan card" so 
as to more powerfully contain mainland China. At the same time, 
it is attempting to join hands with the EC and the United States 
to jointly deal with mainland China. Thus, the report calls on 
"the world to concern itself with the Tibet issue" and is 
pinning high hope on international public opinion toward the 
Hong Kong issue. In addition, the report has done its best to 
sow discord between China and its neighboring countries and has 
brazenly alleged that "other countries, especially China's 
northern and western neighboring countries, will show 
increasingly greater interest in how China is treating other 
minority nationalities," in an attempt to tempt those countries 
to work for Britain. 
  What are some British politicians really after? After some 
further analysis of the report, we find that some British 
politicians have become psychologically imbalanced when faced 
with the rapid growth of China's national strength and its 
increasingly elevated position in the world. They do not want 
to see a powerful China and are being unable to forget their 
dreams of splitting and weakening China and making China return 
to the state of disintegration of the 1940's. Beyond a shadow 
of a doubt, that is the general goal of the British politicians' 
proposal for a policy toward China. The report supports Hong 
Kong, Tibet, and Taiwan to pursue independence in disguise, and 
calls Macao China's "neighboring country." It instigates 
foreign intervention in China's minority nationality issues, 
along with the creation of public opinion on disharmony between 
the central and local governments in China. All this is being 
done in pursuit of "disintegration" and represent important 
steps in their general policy toward China. Out of the need to 
maintain its rule over Hong Kong in the past, Britain was not in 
the position to openly intervene in Taiwan affairs, nor dared it 
be excessively aggressive over the Tibet issue. Now, the 
British seem to have no misgivings whatsoever; in addition to 
the tremendous changes in the world situation in the late 
1980's, Britain has eventually changed its entire policy toward 
China, including its policies toward Hong Kong, Taiwan, and 
Tibet. Regarding the British strategy of disintegration, a 
report written by British International Strategy Society early 
this year contained a relatively detailed discussion of the 
plan, and may serve as a footnote to the British Parliament 
report. 
<H5>  China Is Able To Face Any Challenges </H5>
  The Chinese Government has repeatedly reiterated that the 
Tibet and Taiwan issues and Hong Kong affairs after its return 
to China in 1997 are purely China's internal affairs, and no 
foreign forces have the right to intervene. It is absurd that 
the report should link opposing intervention in another 
country's internal affairs to "restricting the freedom of speech 
of the citizen of another country." Just as was indicated by 
Hong Kong media, should the Chinese discuss the issue of 
Northern Ireland, it is believed that Britain would not tolerate 
it. Especially considering that the issues of Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, and Tibet have a bearing on China's national security 
and stability. Facing such major issues of principle, there is 
no leeway for the Chinese Government. Furthermore, in recent 
years, China has enjoyed a stable political situation, social 
solidarity, and sustained rapid economic growth. Facts have 
shown that China has sufficient confidence and strength to face 
challenges from any international forces. At the same time, 
China's relations with peripheral countries have been 
consolidated and developed, and some Western countries are 
showing their friendliness one after another. The current world 
situation is favorable to China as well. In contrast, British 
domestic issues are piling up, and the Major government can do 
nothing to improve the situation. The Conservatives are 
suffering from a confidence crisis which grows increasingly 
serious with every passing day. In recent British local 
parliamentary elections, the Conservatives have been reduced to 
a third party. At the international level, British influence 
within the EC has all along been insignificant, and its 
relations with the United States are far from what they used to 
be. With increasingly greater importance being attached to 
economic factors, the British attempt to join hands with 
international forces to deal with China is undoubtedly wishful 
thinking. In the final analysis, all factors have decided that 
any evil plots to split China will be in vain.

  [Text] The number of emigrants returning to Hong Kong is 
so high that businesses would be hard hit if they were to head 
back overseas, the Government said yesterday. 
  More than 8,000 people who had fled Hong Kong to obtain 
foreign passports had returned to take advantage of the economic 
boom in 1992, said Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok 
Ka-keung. "In the event of an economic downturn they could very 
well pack their suitcases and leave again. It is entirely 
possible," he said. 
  He did not have figures for the number of returnees last 
year, but said it was likely to be higher than 1992. Results of 
a survey on the problem would be released later in the year? Mr 
Kwok said. 
  Hong Kong University immigration expert Dr Ronald Skeldon 
said he believed "huge numbers" of emigrants had returned to 
Hong Kong in recent years and they were not reflected in 
official figures. 
  Dr Skeldon said the territory should be very aware that an 
economic downturn would send these people away in large numbers. 
"The main reason they have come here is for the money they were 
unable to make elsewhere and if that should change, they will 
leave," he said. The departure of people who worked in 
highly-skilled fields would leave a void far larger than that 
caused by the 1989 Beijing massacre which acted as a catalyst 
for emigration. 
  Mr Kwok said about 53,000 people emigrated from Hong Kong 
last year compared with 66,000 in 1992. Economic good times in 
the territory coupled with an economic downturn in countries 
such as Australia and Canada were major reasons for the drop. 
  Another cause was a reduced intake from some destination 
countries. The figures are based on the number of visas issued 
by consulates in Hong Kong. They do not include immigrant visas 
issued in other countries which an in creasing number of people 
are turning to in an effort to bypass the long delays for visas 
in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Kwok estimated a further 13 percent, or about 7,000, on 
top of the 53,000 who emigrated last year could have done so 
with visas obtained outside Hong Kong. That is an increase of 
about 12 percent from the 1990 figures. 
  To counter the problem in 1989, the Government initiated the 
British Nationality Selection Scheme which offered British 
passports to 13,160 heads of households and their dependants. 
The scheme offered an "insurance policy" to skilled people and 
kept them working in Hong Kong rather than leaving to get 
foreign passports. 
  Mr Kwok said it was "a bit risky" to say the scheme had a 
direct impact on the drop in emigration numbers for this year. 
But it might have had a stabilising effect.

  [Text] Shantou, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Li Ka-shing, noted Hong 
Kong tycoon, has begun to invest in the energy, communications 
and housing of Shantou City, Guangdong Province. 
  His investment has reached about 4 billion yuan since the 
beginning of this year. 
  The projects include a bay bridge, four power plants, a 
container wharf at Zhuchigang Port, and a cement factory. 
  In late April, Li signed an agreement with Shantou Municipal 
Government on a housing project with a total floor space of 1.2 
million square meters. 
  The project will be completed by the end of 2000 and is 
expected to accommodate 70,000 residents. 
  In previous years, Li, chairman of the board of directors of 
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. of Hong Kong, mainly supported 
Shantou's development of public services. 
  As early as in 1982, Li donated funds for a university in 
Shantou. 
  His donations to the university have added up to 887 million 
HK dollars.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA)--A relevant person in 
charge of China's Justice Ministry today pointed out here that 
the report distributed by the organizations such as "Human 
Rights Watch/Asia" on 19 May, which claimed that nearly 500 
prisoners who were arrested during the "4 June" incident have 
been recently discovered in Beijing's No. 2 Prison and Qinghe 
Reform-Through-Labor Farm and have been mistreated is sheer 
rumor with ulterior motives. 
  The relevant person in charge of the Justice Ministry made 
this remark today when responding to a question asked by a 
reporter who was conducting an interview in the Justice Ministry 
about this issue. 
  The person in charge said that, during the "4 June" incident 
five years ago, criminal proceedings were brought against a 
small number of people according to law because they had carried 
out activities aimed at overthrowing the government or had 
engaged in crimes such as smashing, looting, burning, and 
killing. He said that an absolute majority of them have been 
released because they have obtained lenient treatment or have 
served their terms, and the situation of nearly 500 persons 
being imprisoned does not exist. The so-called "new discovery" 
by organizations such as "Human Rights Watch/Asia" is nothing 
but a new rumor created by them. 
  This person in charge also said: Regarding the alleged 
coercion of prison inmates to be quality control workers for 
latex glove exports to the United States, investigations have 
found that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison signed a contract 
with a Beijing factory in 1991 to inspect its latex glove 
products. There were express provisions in the contract that 
all gloves to be inspected were to be sold domestically, and the 
contract has been effectively implemented. There was never any 
question about prisoners checking latex gloves which were 
exported to the United States, much less one about Beijing 
Municipal No 2 Prison producing latex gloves to be exported. 
  This person in charge pointed out: Chinese prisons, 
including the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison, in accordance with 
the law, treat their prisoners humanely. Chinese law expressly 
forbids using corporeal punishment or committing brutalities 
against prisoners. We conduct business strictly according to the 
relevant laws and undertake the civilized management of 
prisoners, who are given genuine legal protection. The Chinese 
"Penal Code" states that corporeal punishment, the mistreatment 
of inmates, and gross infringements of criminals' legitimate 
rights and interests are criminal offenses punishable by law. 
People's procuratorates at all levels have special prison-based 
agencies and staff to monitor the enforcement of these laws. 
The statement that the Beijing Municipal No 2 Prison beat, 
abused, and used corporeal punishment on prisoners is groundless 
and a pure fabrication. 
  In conclusion, this person-in-charge finally pointed out: 
This was not the first time that "Human Rights Watch/Asia" and 
other such organizations have concocted hair-raising lies which 
they have spread to confuse public opinion. But lies are lies. 
Such malicious slander by organizations such as "Human Rights 
Watch/Asia" only succeeds in exposing their hostility toward the 
Chinese people.

should be returned, while the legitimate rights of the 
Palestinian people should be resumed. Sovereignty and security 
of all Mideast countries, including Israel should be respected 
and safeguarded. He noted that China would make effort as it 
was in the past with the international community, especially all 
countries in the Mideast region, in prompting political solution 
to the Mideast problem and in promoting peace and development in 
the region.

  [Text] Beijing, May 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin said here today that Sino-Congolese cooperation had 
yielded good results. 
  During his talks with visiting Congolese President Pascal 
Lissouba this afternoon, Jiang said that the current visit of 
Lissouba witnessed the 30th anniversary of the establishment of 
Sino-Congolese diplomatic ties, and as prime minister, Lissouba 
made efforts in this regard 30 years ago. 
  Jiang said that he was convinced that the visit would 
further 
Sino-Congolese bilateral understanding, and push their relations 
to a high level. 
  He spoke highly of the efforts the Congolese people had made 
under the leadership of the president to find the political and 
economic structures conforming to the country's domestic 
situation. 
  The Chinese Government appreciated Lissouba's view that 
democracy must go along with the Congo's traditional culture, 
and that the country's development needs stability, Jiang said. 
  He also expressed his satisfaction with the effective 
cooperation between China and The Congo, adding that China 
attached great importance to the bilateral ties. 
  "The Chinese people, along with Congolese people, would 
strengthen the bilateral cooperation in different fields on the 
basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," he added. 
  Jiang also expressed his appreciation for The Congo's "one 
China" stand, and support for China's re-entry to the General 
Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. 
  There was great potential in China-Congo two-way trade, he 
said. 
  Lissouba said that social stability and peace were both 
important to economic development. 
  He said that one purpose of his visit was to learn how the 
Chinese people had made their economic achievement. 
  "The Congo, with rich resources to be developed, welcomes 
Chinese enterprises to cooperate with Congolese counterparts," 
he said. 
  After the talks, Jiang and Lissouba were present at the 
signing of an agreement under which the Chinese Government will 
provide credit to The Congo. It was signed by Yang Wensheng, 
Chinese assistant minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, and Clement Mouamba, Congolese minister of planning 
and economy. 
  Before the talks, Jiang held a greeting ceremony for 
Lissouba. 
  Among those present at the greeting ceremony were Li 
Tieying, 
Chinese state councillor and minister in charge of the state 
commission for restructuring the economy, Lu Jiaxi, 
vice-chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing 
Committee, Lu Min, vice-chairman of the China Democratic 
National Construction Association, and Huang Qitao, chairman of 
the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice-minister in 
charge of the State Science and Technology Commission. 
  Lissouba arrived here at noon today for a seven-day state 
visit to China at the invitation of Jiang Zemin. This is 
Lissouba's first visit to China since he became president in 
1992.

<F P=106> [By reporter Kang Xinwen (1660 2450 2429] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, 21 May (XINHUA) -- In an interview with 
Chinese reporters around noon today, Zhu Xun, member of the 
Standing Committee and secretary general of the National 
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] who is accompanying Li Ruihuan during his 
tour of five European nations, briefed reporters on Chairman 
Li's visit and answered their questions. 
  [Reporter] Secretary General Zhu, would you please give an 
overall account of Chairman's Li tour of the four Nordic nations 
and Belgium? 
  [Zhu Xun] At the invitation of the Governments of Finland, 
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark and the Belgian Senate and Chamber 
of Representatives, Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National 
Committee, made an official goodwill visits to these five 
nations from 2 to 21 May. During the tour, Chairman Li met 
leaders of the five nations; had extensive exchanges with people 
from all walks of life in the five nations; visited some 
industrial, agricultural, transportation, and energy facilities, 
enterprises, schools; received representatives of Overseas 
Chinese communities, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and 
Chinese students studying abroad; and called on the personnel of 
Chinese embassies in the five nations. Chairman Li was also 
invited to speak in Sweden and Belgium on China's reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive and its foreign policy. 
Governments and parliaments of the five nations took Chairman 
Li's visits seriously and accorded him warm and friendly 
receptions. The visits achieved the goal of enhancing 
understanding, expanding exchanges, and increasing friendship 
and cooperation. They were a complete success. 
  [Reporter] Would you please tell us more about the 
achievements of the visits? 
  [Zhu Xun] Chairman Li's visits are the first to Western and 
Northern Europe by a chairman of the CPPCC National Committee. 
They represent a major step on the part of the CPPCC toward 
expanding international exchanges and cooperation. The 
achievements are numerous, and the three major ones are as 
follows: 
  First, mutual understanding and friendship between China and 
the five nations were enhanced. Chairman Li had frank and 
friendly [tan cheng you hao 0982 6134 0645 1170] exchanges of 
views with leaders of the five nations on further expanding 
bilateral relations and on some major current international 
issues, reaching a common understanding with them on many of the 
issues. Chairman Li briefed them on China's current economic 
situation. While fully affirming the progress China has made, 
he pointed out the difficulties and complexities involved in 
carrying out socialist modernization in a big country like 
China, stressing the need to keep a consistent grip on the 
intensity of reform, the speed of development, and the degree of 
stability and to balance the relations between reform, 
development, and stability. He told them that China is 
contributing to world peace and progress with its endeavors for 
stability and development. All the leaders of the five nations 
spoke highly of the tremendous achievements China has made in 
economic construction, reform, and opening up and expressed 
understanding of the measures the Chinese Government has taken 
to preserve social stability. Paying serious attention to 
China's growing role and influence in international affairs, 
they said that they wished to expand exchanges and dialogues and 
continue developing economic cooperation and trade with China. 
Addressing issues on human rights and Tibet that were raised by 
the other parties in one form or another, Chairman Li gave a 
systematic account of China's basic stance on human rights and 
reaffirmed China's solemn stand on Tibet. 
  Second, we deepened our understanding of the five nations' 
economic and social conditions. During his tour, Chairman Li 
specifically observed the political, economic, and social 
conditions of the five nations. There is much in their methods 
in science and technology, education, economic management, and 
other areas that we can make use of in implementing 
modernization and establishing a socialist market economic 
system. 
  Third, we expanded the CPPCC's influence. The five nations 
knew very little about the CPPCC. On many occasions during the 
visits, Chairman Li briefed leaders of the five nations on the 
people's congress system and the system of multiparty 
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of 
the CPC, which make up the basic forms of China's socialist 
democracy. In addition to the ruling CPC, China has eight 
democratic parties which participate in state and government 
affairs. They cooperate closely with the CPC on one hand and 
supervise one another on the other. The CPPCC serves as a major 
organization for implementing the system of multiparty 
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of 
the CPC. This has enabled the five nations and the 
international community at large to have a better understanding 
of the political construction of China's socialist democracy, 
the characteristics and strong points of the CPPCC -- an 
organization unlike either China's people's congress or the 
parliament of the West -- and China's political party system. 
  [Reporter] What are your impressions of Chairman Li's 
successful visits? 
  [Zhu Xun] As cultural traditions, social systems, ideology 
differ from country to country, it is inevitable that nations 
will have differences on some issues. Frequent exchange of 
visits and contacts between senior leaders and dialogue based on 
mutual respect will help us seek common ground while putting 
aside differences, enhance mutual understanding, dispel 
misunderstandings, and reach an understanding. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: The CPPCC should take initiative 
and make vigorous efforts in promoting international friendly 
exchanges. These visits have demonstrated the importance of 
Comrade Xiaoping's theory. The CPPCC, being both an official 
and nonofficial organization, has a special role to play in 
China's international exchanges. In the past, the CPPCC made 
major contributions in developing China's friendship and 
cooperation with people of the world and in creating a good 
international image for China. In the future, it should take 
full advantage of its unequaled superior features in promoting 
international cooperation and exchanges and in creating a 
favorable international environment for China's economic 
development. 
  Accompanying Chairman Li on his tour were officials of the 
democratic parties and local CPPCC committees and other public 
figures. This reflects how broadly represented the CPPCC is. 
During the visits, these comrades did a great deal of useful 
work with good results. Their inclusion in the visits itself 
demonstrates the special features of the political construction 
of China's socialist democracy. The CPPCC should review 
experience in this regard in its dealings with foreign nationals 
or organizations in the future.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has issued a pre-4 June emergency order to 
allow immediate arrests on any kind of suspicion. The 
authorities had ordered the strictest security seen in five 
years in the capital, sources said yesterday. China's leaders 
are on full alert against a possible uprising as the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June, 1989, Tiananmen Square incident looms. 
  A special committee has been set up by the State Education 
Commission, the Beijing municipal party committee and district 
party committees to deal with any sudden developments, sources 
close to the Chinese authorities said. 
  There are strong signs of rising tension in the capital, 
with 
the People's Liberation Army (PLA) patrolling the streets and 
leaders nervous about a possible power struggle as paramount 
leader Deng Xiaoping's health declines. The sources said 
protest marches and demonstrations planned for the 4 June 
anniversary were being forced underground by the clampdown. 
  The authorities have banned large gatherings in Beijing 
during this sensitive period. A charity fund-raising campaign 
being organised by a group of Hong Kong businessmen to be held 
later this week has had to be cancelled because of the emergency 
order. 
  The authorities fear that another upheaval like the 
pro-democracy movement of 1989 could spark a power struggle, 
sources said. A source quoted a state leader's son as saying 
that Deng Xiaoping had become a "vegetable" because of serious 
illness. 
  There have been strong rumours about Mr Deng's declining 
health since he appeared on Chinese Central Television earlier 
this year looking dull. "State leaders are living in a very 
tense atmosphere and are alert to every small change," the 
source said. 
  Leaders fear, a power struggle when Mr Deng dies--a 
repetition of what had happened after the death of the party 
chairman Mao Zedong. Meanwhile, high inflation and a large trade 
deficit had put huge pressure on state leaders, he said. 
  "Many Chinese officials wish that Deng Xiaoping could appear 
in public again to stabilise public feeling." On previous 
anniversaries of the crackdown, only armed police have been on 
patrol, a resident said. 
  But now PLA troops have been seen patrolling day and night 
in 
Beijing, including at Chang An Street, the main street and the 
longest in the capital. Meanwhile, Beijing has sent a circular 
to institutions, urging citizens to be cautious in the "serious" 
period between 6 May and 10 June. "Do not listen to the rumours 
of conspirators, do not gather around to watch in public areas, 
treasure the present good and stable atmosphere that the 
opening-up policy has brought," it said.

<F P=106> [Zou Jiahua's televised speech on safe production; from the </F>
"National News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] A safe production week campaign will be launched 
across the country 16-22 May this year. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
delivered a television speech on the campaign. 
  [Begin Zou Jiahua recording] During the safe production week 
campaign, the people's governments and the departments concerned 
at all levels should firmly seize the opportunity. Leading 
cadres at various levels should set an example in treating it as 
an important task. The safe production week campaign should be 
unfolded truly in an organized, well-guided, and down-to-earth 
way. It is necessary to stress actual results and prevent 
formalism. It is necessary to use the news and propaganda media 
and adopt lively and effective measures to give a concentrated 
publicity to the principles and policies of the party and the 
government concerning the safety in production. 
  People should be commended for good deeds in safe 
production. 
Anyone who neglects safety in production should be exposed. The 
wrongdoing of acting recklessly and violating the operating 
rules should be resolutely stopped. We should guide and 
supervise enterprises so that they pay great attention to safety 
at all times. 
  We should mobilize all quarters of society so that they 
attach importance to safety in production and be concerned about 
it. In this way, we will create a good social climate in which 
everyone is concerned about safety and ensures safety in 
everything. 
  All enterprises should regard production safety as very 
urgent work and do it well. They should take up the 
responsibility for safe production. In light of the reality of 
their own trade, they should mobilize the masses to check 
loopholes and adopt measures to eliminate hidden danger, solve 
conspicuous problems concerning production safety, and ensure 
safe production. 
  Ensuring production safety is very important work and of 
benefit to both the country and the people. It is also a 
protracted, complex, and arduous task. We must constantly 
stress it, pay attention to it everyday, and do it daily. We 
should do all we can to perform our duties on our jobs and take 
the initiative in making even greater contributions to safety in 
production and to the long-term peace and stability in our 
country. Thank you! [end recording]

<F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 17 May (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua 
recently pointed out at the closing ceremony of the national 
conference of directors of posts and telecommunications bureaus: 
The postal and telecommunications services should seize the 
present opportunity to improve service and accelerate the 
development of telecommunications, while adhering to the 
16-character principle of overall planning, regional and 
inter-departmental cooperation, designation of responsibility at 
various levels, and joint construction. 
  Zou Jiahua said: The development of transport and 
telecommunications will directly promote commodity circulation 
and the development of socialist market economy in our country. 
The present international environment is favorable to us, we 
ourselves have the necessary conditions for development, and 
there is an increasing demand for communications service in the 
society. So, it is a very good time for us to develop the 
postal and telecommunications services. With the concerted 
efforts made by the workers and cadres, the postal and 
telecommunications department last year invested 40 billion yuan 
in fixed assets, increased the capacity of telephone exchanges 
by 12.86 million lines, and put into operation eight optical 
cables. The achievements were tremendous and exceptional in the 
history of the world's telecommunications. 
  On the 16-character principle, he explained: Overall 
planning means that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
should change its past practice, pay more attention to 
macroeconomic management of the nation's telecommunications, and 
shift its emphasis from microeconomic management to 
macroeconomic management of the telecommunications business in 
the country. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
should seriously formulate a strategic principle, a long-range 
development plan, and an annual development plan for the 
development of China's telecommunications. On regional and 
interdepartmental cooperation, he pointed out: It is necessary 
to foster the idea of joint efforts and cooperation; pool the 
scientific research forces and the production forces of all 
departments, provinces, and cities; and prevent duplicated 
construction projects. We should build well a nationwide public 
telecommunications network. At the same time, we should also 
make the special-purpose telecommunications network play its 
role. We should bring into full play the initiative of both the 
localities and various departments. 
  He added: In order to accelerate the development of the 
postal and telecommunications services, we should rely on 
scientific and technological progresses. In the last few years, 
the postal and telecommunications services have taken a greater 
stride in using new technology. We have adopted many advanced 
telecommunications techniques of the world, such as 
program-controlled exchange, optical fiber communications, 
satellite communications, and mobile communications. The postal 
and telecommunications department should cooperate with other 
departments and pool resources in research and development. 
  He pointed out: While developing itself, the postal and 
telecommunications department should improve service and turn 
the users' demand into a motive force for it to improve its 
work. Instead of treating telecommunications service as a power 
in our hands, we should establish the notion of serving the 
people and serving the national economy.

<F P=106> [Speech by Huang Ju: "A Shanghai Which is Embarking on </F>
Reform and Opening Up is Making Great Strides Toward the New 
Century," during the 1994 International High-Level Economic 
Forum in Beijing on 12 May] 
  [Text] 1. The Status of Shanghai in China's Reform, 
Opening Up, and Economic Development 
  The salient features of the contemporary international 
economy are economic openness and a trend toward economic 
integration. A unique position dictates that Shanghai, being a 
metropolis in the Orient and China's largest economic center, 
should bring its superiority into full play, directly join the 
international division of labor, be a member in the grand 
international economic circle, and promote the development of 
the international economy together with other modern 
international cities. 
  Geographically speaking, Shanghai is situated at the 
confluence of China's golden coast and the Chang Jiang's golden 
waterway. The Chang Jiang Basin has long been called the dragon 
of the Chinese economy. Its population and land area account 
for two-thirds and one-fourth, respectively, of China. It 
produces 40 percent of China's gross industrial and agricultural 
output value. As Shanghai, which is called the "crossing point 
of river and sea and the metropolis of southeast China," has 
access to information, a pool of skilled people, and a good 
transportation network, it ranks top among the coastal cities 
along the Chang Jiang and even in the entire country in terms of 
industrial, commercial, trade, technology, and financial levels 
and their input/output and investment return rates, as well as 
the differential rent levels. 
  Seen from the market environment perspective, Shanghai is 
the 
most important hub linking China's market to the international 
market. Historically, Shanghai has been an important center for 
distribution and transshipment of domestic and foreign goods and 
has been known as the "number one port among the five treaty 
ports that have been open to foreign trade." At a time when 
China is fully opening itself up to the outside world, Shanghai 
is not only going all out to restore, but also consolidate its 
top position. It has become a large exchange center for 
domestic and foreign capital, commodities, technologies, skilled 
personnel, and information. Shanghai's function as a market hub 
is made all the more pronounced with the stepped-up construction 
of such modern transportation facilities as airports, harbors, 
railways, and expressways, with the successive establishment of 
a number of state-level financial and production-factors 
markets, as well as the construction of the Pudong Waigaoqiao 
Bonded Zone, the largest bonded zone in China. 
  Seen from the perspective of reform, opening up, and 
development, Shanghai is now standing at the forefront of 
China's reform and opening up in the 1990's. Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics has brought about an epoch-making transformation 
to China as a whole. With the implementation of the strategy to 
develop China's coastal economy in the 1980's, the Zhujiang 
Basin in south China took the lead in realizing an economic 
take-off. With the marked increase in the nation's economic 
strength and the gradual formulation of a strategy for 
comprehensive reform and opening up in the early 1990's, the 
Changjiang Basin, with Shanghai as the "locomotive," began to 
become the important center for China's reform and opening up 
drive. In April, 1990, the Chinese Government made a strategic 
decision by opening up and developing the Shanghai New Pudong 
Zone and called on Shanghai to build itself into one of the 
international economic, finance, and trade centers. This 
indicated that Shanghai moved from the sidelines and stepped 
into the limelight of China's reform and opening up. 
  2. Shanghai's Reform and Opening Up and Economic 
Development Have Entered a New Period 
  Here, I would like to report on the economic development, 
reform, and opening up in Shanghai since the 1990's, 
particularly in the last several years. 
  (1) The national economy enters a sustained and rapid 
development stage. In the past, Shanghai's overall economic 
development speed was lower than that of the nation's average 
level due to the long practice of a planned economic system. In 
the entire 1980's, while the nation's GNP grew at 9 percent, 
Shanghai grew only at 7.4 percent. Shanghai gradually stepped 
up its development and began to enter the stage of sustained and 
rapid growth. The municipality scored a GNP growth rate 
exceeding 14 percent both in 1992 and 1993. Quality of the 
economic growth, in particular, was greatly enhanced. A number 
of such new pillar-industries such as car-manufacturing, 
communications, electronics began to take shape. The proportion 
of tertiary industry in the municipal national economy grew from 
21 percent in 1980 to 38 percent in 1993. It is expected that 
in the next few years, Shanghai's industrial structure will be 
further upgraded in a rational manner and the national economy 
will continue to maintain the momentum of a sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development. 
  (2) Economic structural reform has been carried out in a 
comprehensive manner. Since the beginning of the 1990's, 
Shanghai has carried out indepth reform centering on reforming 
enterprises, markets, and government's administrative 
structures, and has scored a number of breakthroughs in 
progress. It has carried out comprehensive enterprise reforms. 
Nearly 90 percent of state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises adopted various ways to change their operation 
mechanisms. By the end of 1993, 118 enterprises became limited 
liability companies, 92 of them became listed companies. Nearly 
3,000 state-owned and collective-owned small and medium-sized 
enterprises experimented with joint stock operations. Some 
enterprises practiced contracting and leasing operations. The 
market system was improved. Eleven state-level exchange centers 
and large-scale exchange markets including securities, metals, 
grain, and cooking oils were opened one after another, with 
total transaction amounting to 1,000 billion yuan in 1993, of 
which the securities exchange market's stock transactions 
amounted to 520 billion yuan. The foreign exchange regulatory 
market's transactions in 1993 reached $5.3 billion, up 45 
percent from 1992. In the course of a rapid transition from a 
planned economy to a market economy, the municipal government 
began to switch from a direct control of the economy to an 
indirect one and to gradually improve and enhance the economic 
regulatory and control system. 
  (3) A new pattern of opening up to the outside world is 
gradually taking shape. With the constant improvement of the 
soft and hard investment environment, more and more foreign 
businessmen came to invest in Shanghai over the last two years. 
Some 100 world-famous transnational companies like Dupont from 
the United States, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Sharp from Japan, 
Volkswagen from Germany, Bell from Belgium, and the Charoen 
Pokphand Group from Thailand invested in Shanghai. Some 2,000 
foreign enterprises recouped their investment and begun to earn 
profits. In 1993, Shanghai approved over 3,800 foreign 
investment projects, of which 3,600 were direct foreign 
investment. Of the $7.79 billion negotiated foreign investment 
fund, $3.175 billion was actually invested. Sectors that were 
opened up for foreign investment also expanded from industrial 
sectors to other sectors including finance, real estate, 
domestic and foreign trade, and consultation service. Shanghai 
approved the opening of 28 foreign bank branches. Shanghai is 
becoming an open city which has adapted to the development of 
the world economy. 
  (4) Our efforts to develop the New Pudong Zone have 
gradually been shifted from building infrastructure facilities 
to promoting the function of such facilities. In the early 
1990's, the Chinese Government decided to develop Pudong. This 
decision encouraged both Chinese and foreign investors. The 
construction and development in Pudong were particularly 
noteworthy as shown in the fact that funds kept flowing into 
this zone through various channels. The volume of fixed asset 
investment increased by more than 200 percent every year. By 
1993, such investment reached 16.5 billion yuan, representing a 
growth of nearly 11 times that of 1990. Infrastructure 
facilities for transportation, energy, communications, and 
environmental protection, including such backbone projects as 
the Nanpu Bridge and the Yangpu Bridge, were accomplished one 
after another, creating to the fullest extent, conditions for 
improving Shanghai's investment environment. Four key 
functional sub-zones have been fully developed and put into 
operation. By the end of 1993, more than 200 projects have been 
built in the Jinqiao Export Processing Zones. The acreage of 
the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone has been expanded to 10 square 
kilometers, with nearly 200 Chinese and foreign enterprises 
operating in it. Construction of 54 skyscrapers is under way now 
in the Lujiazui Banking and Trade Zone. The Zhangjiang High 
Technology Zone has been put into operation. In 1993, the GNP 
gained in the New Pudong Zone reached 16.4 billion yuan or, if 
calculated in terms of comparable price, a 200 percent increase 
over that of 1990. 
  (5) Large scale infrastructural construction projects have 
been launched. Friends who visited Shanghai were surprised by 
the central district's dense population and it's narrow, twisted 
roads lined with shabby huts, and full of slow-moving traffic. 
This situation is undergoing a rapid change. In the early 
1990's, Shanghai began to fundamentally get rid of a situation 
in which urban infrastructure facilities lagged behind economic 
development. The infrastructure facility investment over the 
past two years is larger than that of the 1987-1992 period. The 
Shanghai-Jiading and Shanghai-Songjiang Superhighways, the Bund 
Overall Renovation Project, the renovation projects for Yanggao 
Road in Pudong and Jiangsu Road in Puxi, the overall renovation 
projects for Huaihia Road -- a famous commercial district, as 
well as other major urban transportation projects, have been 
accomplished one after another. In terms of the length and the 
acreage of the roads, last year Shanghai witnessed an increase 
of 62 percent and 53 percent, respectively, over the previous 
year. The construction of the Line One Subway, the Inner 
Traffic Link, the Chengdu Viaduct, and other projects are now in 
full swing. They are expected to be finished and put into 
service by the end of this year. It is expected that these 
projects will improve Shanghai's traffic condition. Breakthrough 
progress has been made in renovating old housing districts. In 
1993, Shanghai accomplished its housing renovation projects with 
a total floor space of 2.58 million square meters. It is 
expected that Shanghai will basically accomplish the task of 
renovating old housing districts by the end of this century. 
<H5>  3. The Prospect For Shanghai's Reform, Opening Up, and </H5>
Economic Development 
  The twenty first century will be a century for great changes 
in the world's economic scene. Representing a forerunner of 
China's reform and opening up drive, Shanghai faces an 
once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for development. It takes 
great courage, profound wisdom, long-term strategy, and clear 
thinking to seize the opportunity and meet the challenge. In 
light of the overall pattern for the state's economic 
development, reform, and opening up, Shanghai has adopted its 
strategic goal for the next century. We are ready to build 
Shanghai into one of the world's economic, banking, and trade 
centers in about 20 years of time. Pudong will basically be 
turned into a new urban district -- an export-oriented, 
multi-functional, modern area boasting the top world standards. 
The following three steps are needed to achieve this goal: To 
lay a foundation before 1995, to form a framework before 2000, 
and to basically realize the goal before 2010. 
  To achieve its long-term development goal, Shanghai will 
devote its efforts to the following tasks in the 1990's: While 
taking the lead in the establishment of the operation mechanism 
of a socialist market economy and striving to maintain around 10 
percent GNP growth, Shanghai will accelerate the pace of 
allowing the domestic economy to dovetail with the international 
economy. The city will carry out a series of major measures 
that are suitable to Shanghai, including: 
  (1) In accordance with the policy of improving Shanghai's 
economy quicker and better than other localities, Shanghai will 
carry out a comprehensive reform of the enterprise system. 
Shanghai is a place where state-owned enterprises, and 
especially state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, 
concentrate. Bringing into full play the guiding role of the 
state-owned economic sector will be of great importance to 
achieving the goal of developing Shanghai's economy. To achieve 
this goal, Shanghai will spare no efforts in reappraising the 
stocks and assets of enterprises, defining property rights, 
appraising properties and other fundamental work so as to 
accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system. 
Enterprises with favorable conditions should adopt the 
corporate system, with the limited responsibility company as a 
main form. Efforts should be made to improve enterprises' 
organizational systems and set up large chain enterprises, 
conglomerate firms, enterprise groups, and multinational 
companies. In this way, we can help enterprises enter the 
highly competitive domestic and international markets as an army 
group and turn them into a major factor for promoting Shanghai's 
economic development. 
  (2) To accelerate the establishment of a modern large market 
system that extends over all regions. Shanghai will devote 
itself to setting up markets for stocks, futures, off-shore 
banking, gold trading, foreign exchange, and real estate -- all 
of the things that embody the functions of a metropolitan city. 
It will take active measures to create favorable conditions to 
allow the domestic economy to dovetail with the international 
economy. It will form as soon as possible a modern large market 
system facilitating the circulation of domestic and 
international funds, commodities, technologies, talented 
personnel, and information. 
  (3) To form a large batch of modern industrial enterprises. 
Shanghai will accelerate the strategic adjustment of its 
industrial structure. It will focus on the development of 
banking, trade, real estate, tourism, and other tertiary 
industries. It will accelerate the development of pillar 
industries such as limousines, electronic communications, steel, 
petrochemical industry, chemical industry, and power station 
equipment. It will take active measures to promote high and new 
technological industry, with the focus on microelectronic and 
bioengineering projects. In this way, Shanghai will be able to 
bring its industrial advantages into full play. By the end of 
this century, these industries will become industries with an 
economic scale of more than scores of billions of yuan. Their 
added output value will account for more than 50 percent of 
Shanghai's GNP. 
  (4) Shanghai will accelerate construction of urban 
infrastructural projects that are suitable for a modern 
cosmopolitan city. In accordance with the requirements for 
developing a modern cosmopolitan city, Shanghai will 
comprehensively carry out a series of infrastructural 
construction projects including telecommunications, energy 
resources, water supply, sewage, and environmental protection, 
while regarding the overall communications programs as its key 
projects. Shanghai will accelerate construction of a second 
international airport, the Pudong International 
Telecommunications Center, an all-weather deepwater port, 
underground railways across the whole municipality, and ring 
roads. Eventually Shanghai will become a modern cosmopolitan 
city that has rational urban structural designs, advanced 
traffic networks, efficient telecommunications facilities, and a 
favorable ecological environment. 
  (5) Shanghai will further develop and open up Pudong to the 
outside world. With a total area of about 520 sq km, the Pudong 
New District is more than seven times the size of Puxi's central 
urban areas, is a new domain for Shanghai to develop its 
economy, and has enormous potential for further development. 
Shanghai will initially implement a comprehensive policy of 
reform and opening up in the Pudong New District in an effort to 
accelerate its development and opening up in an all-around 
manner. By the year 2000, Pudong will have an urban area of 100 
sq km with an increased GNP value of 50 billion yuan. After 
accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, the Pudong New 
District will eventually become a pioneer and exemplary zone 
linking Chinese and international markets in an all-around 
manner. 
  (6) Shanghai will gradually implement a strategy for 
establishing the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere. To 
achieve its future economic progress, Shanghai must make full 
use of the advantages of its special location, and 
comprehensively develop all its strategic economic aspects for 
progress. In accordance with the concept of "restructuring the 
central urban areas, building more secondary cities, upgrading 
the system of suburban cities and towns, and strengthening the 
link with a network of neighboring cities," we will establish 
the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere that "has several 
groups and circles with different centers which will, in turn, 
have ripple effects on one another." The greater Shanghai 
metropolitan sphere will have four different circles including a 
modern financial and trading circle, a highly-specialized 
processing industrial circle, a highly-efficient agricultural 
circle, and a circle of neighboring cities. Hence, Shanghai 
will make fresh contributions to eventually orchestrating 
economic progress in the Changjiang River delta and to rapidly 
enhancing China's economic development. 
  When the time comes, we will cruise smoothly in the sea, 
cross the oceans, and face the world. Shanghai people are 
enthusiastically and unremittingly designing a blueprint geared 
to the 21st century. Global economic prosperity relies on joint 
efforts of mankind. Today Shanghai, with its ongoing reform and 
opening up to the outside world, yearns anxiously, as never 
before, to enhance cooperation and exchanges with various 
countries in the world. To realize its splendid objectives of 
development, Shanghai must face the world and open up to the 
outside world in an all-round manner. At present, Shanghai has 
become China's most favorable area for investors. I sincerely 
hope old and new friends from various countries in the world 
will come to invest and launch joint ventures in Shanghai so as 
to share together the forthcoming enormous benefits that will 
arise from the invigoration of Shanghai and from the development 
of Pudong.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui said 
Monday [23 May] that he wants to establish a sound 
constitutional system in Taiwan as soon as possible. 
  He made the remarks at a National Assembly session in an 
apparent effort to calm the hot discussion stemming from remarks 
he made in Costa Rica that he has a dream "to transfer power to 
somebody else peacefully before my death". 
  "The constitutional system is my dream and I would like to 
hand over political power to the next president after he is 
elected," Li told the assembly. 
  On whether he will seek re-election, President Li said that 
he would not answer the question since the National Assembly has 
not begun its discussion of the proposed change in the method of 
presidential elections. 
  The National Assembly began its three-month special session 
in Yangmingshan on May 2 to consider proposed amemdments to the 
constitution and nominations by President Li of the grand 
justices and the head of the judicial yuan. 
  In their respective proposals on constitutional change, both 
the ruling Kuomintang and opposition Democratic Progressive 
Party have in common only one point: that the election of the 
president should be done by popular vote rather than by the vote 
of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past.

  [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan will not 
visit any country besides El Salvador and Guatemala during his 
upcoming trip, a ranking official at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs said Monday [23 May]. 
  The official, who requested anonymity, made the statement to 
refute an earlier press report that the premier will make a 
secret visit to Mexico on his way to the two Central American 
countries. 
  Bilateral ties between Taiwan and Mexico have held stable 
despite the lack of diplomatic relations, he pointed out, noting 
the Taipei economic and cultural office opened in Mexico City on 
May 1. The two countries suspended official ties in 1971. 
  Lien will leave for San Salvador May 30 as President Li 
Teng-hui's special envoy to attend the inauguration of newly 
elected President Armando Calderon Sol on June 1. 
  He will then proceed to Guatemala City June 2 for a four-day 
visit and is scheduled to return to Taipei June 7.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry 
spokesman of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) 
accused the United States today of distorting facts when it 
described the country as a "terrorist nation." 
  On May 9, the U.S. State Department had issued an annual 
report on terrorism in which it called the DPRK a "terrorist 
nation," according to reports. 
  The DPRK spokesman said that by accusing his country of 
being 
a terrorist nation, the United States was hoping to conceal its 
own terrorist activities. 
  He said that the United States is taking advantage of the 
terrorist issue and current disagreement over the nuclear issue, 
to malign the DPRK. 
  The spokesman said that his country opposes any terrorist 
activity, and does not engage in support to any terrorist 
activity. 
  He demanded that the United States improve its own behavior 
and try to get rid of its own dub-name of "head of terror."

People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is setting up a representative 
office of the Korean People's Army in Panmunjom as a replacement 
for its membership of the 40-year-old Korean Military Armistice 
Commission. 
  Yu Myong Chol, the first liaison officer of the Korean 
People's Army at Panmunjom, informed the U.S. side of the

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The United States and 
Japan have reached comprise to resume their trade framework 
negotiations which collapsed in February, the Clinton 
administration announced today. 
  The talks, which used to include auto and auto parts, 
insurance and government procurement, will soon be expanded to 
cover such areas as financial services and intellectual 
property, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor disclosed. 
  In the forthcoming talks with Tokyo, Washington will still 
seek "objective criteria" to evaluate progress on trade, 
although it will no longer seek numerical targets or managed 
trade, Kantor said. 
  "We needed qualitative and quantitative criteria, and we 
were 
not seeking to manage trade or to seek numerical targets," like 
quotas, Kantor said. "We have confirmed we are not seeking 
numerical targets." 
  Objective criteria, Kantor noted, will provide the basis for 
deciding if the agreements succeed or fail to meet their purpose 
to achieve concrete results. 
  Meanwhile, Kantor stressed, "I think it's fair to say that 
the two countries are moving forward on the economic area as 
well as in the strategic and political areas as well." 
  On February 11, President Clinton and then Japanese Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed to reach an agreement on the 
trade framework talks, in which the U.S. wanted to set numerical 
targets for U.S. sales to Japan. 
  Kantor stressed that the Clinton administration, in the 
forthcoming talks, will still seek to substantially increase 
sales and access to Japanese markets.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Wang Nan: "U.S.-Japan Trade Compromise"] </F>
  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- When the U.S. and 
Japan agreed today to restart trade framework negotiations, 
their agreement is a fine-print compromise. 
  More than three months after the collapse of the first 
talks, 
it is in the interests of Washington and Tokyo to break the 
logjam, observers said. 
  But is the agreement, as officials here stressed, a "firm 
commitment" towards reducing Japan's trade surplus with America, 
60 billion dollars last year? 
  Today's agreement is the ninth of its kind between 
Washington 
and Tokyo in 16 months, following those on apples, rice, copper, 
chemicals, construction and phones. 
  The two countries have had 37 trade pacts in the past, 
though 
many are not working or working well because, according to the 
U.S. officials, they are merely process-oriented. 
  It was last fall that the U.S. and Japan started the 
framework negotiations on three priority trade areas: Auto and 
auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of 
telecommunications and medical equipment. 
  As Japanese officials maintained, though frequently denied 
by 
Washington, the U.S. tried in vain to set numerical targets in 
the talks and use them to measure the progress Japan made in 
market access. 
  The government of then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
found 
it hard to yield, and after his Washington meeting with U.S. 
President Bill Clinton on February 11, the framework talks were 
finally declared dead. 
  Today's agreement, as explained by U.S. officials, has a few 
key differences, at least in forms. 
  Instead of setting numerical targets to measure Japanese 
trade liberalization, Washington agreed to use "objective 
criteria", both qualitative and quantitative, as the 
prerequisite to restart talks. 
  Meanwhile, unlike last year's agreement which self-imposed a 
deadline of six months for final talks on priority areas, no 
deadline can be found in today's compromise. 
  Moreover, Washington and Tokyo agreed, quite optimistically, 
to extend their framework talks soon to cover financial 
services, glass and intellectual property. 
  The agreement, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
declared, "shows that (we) can resolve issues and strengthen 
relationships and boost confidence between the two countries to 
move in the right direction." 
  U.S. officials, speaking to reporters today, stressed that 
the new qualitative and quantitative criteria are only used to 
measure progress and are never intended to constitute numerical 
targets or quotas. 
  In a 1992 agreement, Japan was made to agree that foreign 
penetration of its semiconductors market should reach 20 
percent, a numerical target or quota. 
  "We were never for (the quotas)," Kantor explained. "We're 
not doing that in this agreement." 
  As to quantitative criteria, the number of Japanese auto 
dealers handling cars built in the U.S., for example, will be 
measured. 
  As to qualitative criteria, the degree of cooperation in 
joint research, development and design between U.S. auto parts 
suppliers and Japanese car makers, for example, will be measured. 
  Why not a deadline? "It would be unfortunate, unnecessary 
and unreasonable to put any particular date on these agreement," 
Kantor explained. "We'll move quickly, though."

<F P=106> [By Bian Hongwei: "Northeast Asia Building for Economic </F>
Bloc After Cold War"] 
  [Text] Economic co-operation among Northeast Asian 
countries is facing mixed blessings during the post-Cold War era. 
  Although huge co-operative potential exists, the so-called 
regional "economic bloc" still remains just a theory, said Lu 
Nanquan, secretary general of the China Society of Eastern 
European and Central Asian Studies. 
  He made the remark at a recent symposium on co-operation 
between China and neighbouring Asian countries, in which some 50 
scholars took part. 
  The detente following the 40-year Cold War provides 
Northeast 
Asian countries with a solid external atmosphere for economic 
co-operation, said Lu. 
  And the development of regional economic blocs in other 
parts 
of the world, such as the European Union and North American Free 
Trade Agreement, provides great inspiration, Lu added. 
  In the broader sense, Northeast Asia includes Northeast 
China, Russia's Far East, the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea (DPRK), the Republic of Korea (ROK), Japan and Mongolia. 
Market economies now dominate the region and economic 
development is the priority here. 
  Bilateral trade between the neighbouring countries has been 
active in recent years. For example, the trade volume between 
China and the ROK reached $8.9 billion last year, and that 
between China and Russia totalled $7.2 billion, up by 24 per 
cent over the previous year. 
  Meanwhile, economic co-operation between Japan and Russia, 
and between the ROK and DPRK, has also seen steady growth. 
  "These factors form a solid basis for the booming economic 
co- operation between nations in the region," said Lu. 
<H5>  Potential </H5>
  Northeast Asia boasts a sound economic foundation and rich 
national resources, which hold great potential for the further 
development of the region. 
  The United Nations Development Programme has decided to 
invest $30 billion in the next 20 years in the Tumen River 
Project, which should give a boost to relations among Northeast 
Asian countries. 
  The fact that Northeast Asia includes developed and 
developing countries facilitates co-operation in capital, 
technology and natural resources, said Lu, adding that this also 
provides opportunities for the flow of labour and products. 
  However, Lu admitted that it was difficult to push into 
being 
the theoretically-sound economic bloc. 
  The Cold War has overshadowed the region for so long and 
with 
such an intensity that it is a demanding job to integrate the 
economic group, Lu said. 
  Countries of the region are miles apart in political and 
economic systems, making it hard to eliminate ideological and 
military conflicts quickly. 
  He also pointed out that Japan's attitude to creating a new 
economic nexus is key, as it is the biggest potential investor 
in the region. Unfortunately, its militant history brings many 
doubts to further co-operation in the Northeast Asian region. 
  Economically, Japan is adjusting its strategy, shifting its 
investment focus from North America and Europe to Asia. Within 
Asia, Japan's emphasis will move from the Southeast to the 
Northeast. The adjustment, however, takes time due to the cycle 
of investment returns, said Lu. 
  He predicted that economic co-operation in the region will 
spread from trade to manufacturing and technology, starting with 
bilateral relations before turning in a multilateral direction. 
  Small economic co-operative zones will likely emerge first 
to 
form a basis for the development of the whole bloc, Lu added. 
  Another influential power to the booming economic group is 
the United States, Lu said at the symposium. 
  Although America is far away from Northeast Asia, it has a 
great impact in the region, especially on the Korean Peninsula. 
<H5>  Interests </H5>
  The United States is eager to protect its political and 
economic interests in the region, which determines its 
willingness to become involved in projects here, said Lu. 
  Judith Thornton, a professor with the University of 
Washington in Seattle, shared Lu's view, saying the U.S. sees 
itself as an active participant in and beneficiary of Asian 
economic growth. 
  Seen from the economic point of view, the American scholar 
said, U.S. involvement in the Asian-Pacific market stems mainly 
from the self-interested actions of American exporters and 
importers, borrowers and investors participating in the 
fast-growing economic development. 
  She also pointed out that the potential areas of economic 
co-operation lie in infrastructure construction, including 
transport, telecommunications and energy. 
  Major ports in the region like Dalian, Vladivostok, 
Nakhodka, 
and Vostochniy have the potential to serve as a gateway to the 
heartland of Asia and Siberia. 
  The Tumen River Project would encourage joint efforts by 
Russia and China to build transport links. And it is just as 
likely that expansion of China's transport network will be 
competitive with the Eurasian Continental Bridge, said Thornton. 
  A pipeline carrying natural gas from Turkmenistan and 
Kazakhstan to Central China will be constructed to bring the oil 
and gas of Sakhalin to Central China, South Korea and Japan. 
  The pipeline is expected to be funded by Japanese lenders or 
other international financial organizations such the World Bank 
and Asian Investment Bank. 
  East Siberia contains significant energy supplies including 
oil, gas and hydroelectric. Further development of the energy 
sector will fuel the economic growth of the region.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 24 (XINHUA) -- China will remain 
a peace-loving country even it becomes developed in the next 
century, said the leader of the Chinese delegation to the 27th 
International Meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council 
(PBEC). 
  At a session on "China in the 21st century" here today, 
Zheng 
Hongye, who is chairman of China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade, told the delegates that by the middle of 
the next century, China is set to be a middle-level developed 
nation and an important force in safeguarding international 
peace. 
  By the end of this century, the Chinese people would 
generally lead a relatively rich life, thus greatly 
strengthening their purchasing power, raising their level of 
consumption, and providing strong support to Asian and world 
economic development, Zheng said. 
  China will open its market in a even large scale by then, he 
said, and its total accumulated imports are expected to reach 
one trillion U.S. dollars in the seven years till 2000. 
  However, Zheng added, although the overall economic strength 
of China will be markedly improved at the beginning of the next 
century, there will still be a big gap between it and developed 
nations in terms of per capita income. 
  He said China together with other peace-loving countries 
will 
make painstaking efforts to establish a new world order for 
peace, stability, cooperation and development. 
  "China is and will be a peace-loving country. It will never 
invade, interfere and bully others and never seek hegemony," 
Zheng said. 
  At the same time, he pointed out, China will continue to 
follow its own development path. "It is impossible for the 
Chinese to accept the way imposed by outsiders who try to direct 
them to do this or that according to their models and 
intentions," he said. 
  PBEC is a non-governmental organization set up in 1967. Its 
membership has risen to 17 with China, Russia and Colombia 
formally joining it at the current meeting. 
  The three-day gathering, which opened on Monday [23 May], 
deals with the current economic situation, regional economic 
cooperation and specific business issues relating to 
telecommunications, air transportation, financial services, 
energy and tourism.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. Navy ship, 
while enforcing the international sanctions against Haiti, fired 
warning shots Monday [23 May] night at a ship off Haiti, the 
Defense Department said here today. 
  The U.S. frigate Antrin encountered a Panamanian-flagged 
ship, called "Leonese," off the north coast of Haiti and ordered 
the ship to lay to, but it did not, Pentagon Spokesman Dennis 
Boxx said at a news briefing. 
  The U.S. Navy ship fired 10 50-caliber warning shots across 
the bow of the Leonese, and the ship did lay to, said Boxx. 
  Boxx also said another incident occurred on Sunday. A 
Bahamian- registered seagoing tug, called the sea search, 
ignored instructions from a U.S. Navy ship to stop and warning 
shots were fired across the bow. 
  Two additional U.S. Navy ships have been ordered to help 
enforce the sanctions against Haiti after President Bill Clinton 
signed on May 21 an executive order participating in the tougher 
sanctions authorized by the United Nations. 
  That brings ships involved in the sanctions enforcement to a 
total of 8 U.S. Navy ships and two other ships, one Argentine 
and one Canadian frigate, Boxx said.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
House of Representatives today endorsed a motion opposing U.S. 
military action against Haiti but supporting a plan to use a 
nearby island as a place for screening refugees. 
  The motion, put forward by Representative Porter Goss and 
endorsed by a 223-201 vote, is not binding but expresses 
congressional opinion. 
  The motion opposes U.S. military action against Haiti unless 
there is a clear and pressing danger to U.S. interests or 
citizens. 
  But it supports the use of Ile de Gonava, a 35-by-8-mile 
island, for screening refugees seeking asylum in the U.S., as 
well as for a base of operations for exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on May 8 some changes 
in U.S. immigration policy on Haitians. 
  U.S. officials will no longer send Haitian boat people home 
without any asylum screening, but will determine on board ship 
or in another country who are bona fide political refugees. 
  Clinton has also said that he would not rule out a military 
option against Haiti.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 25 (XINHUA) -- GATT 
Director-General Peter Sutherland today urged all signatory 
countries to ratify the Uruguay Round agreement without delay. 
  "There will certainly be some governments facing significant 
domestic pressures seeking to amend the deal or even to overturn 
it altogether", he warned when addressing the 27th international 
meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC) here today. 
  "However, such governments will have to face down those 
pressures knowing that the rest of the world is waiting and 
watching," he told the plenary session on critical trade issues 
under the theme of "Aftermath of the Uruguay Round". 
  At a press conference later he said about 20 to 30 of the 
120 
GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) contracting 
members have ratified the Uruguay Round of agreement adopted in 
Marrakesh this year, paving the way for the formation of the 
World Trade Organization on January 1 next year. 
  There were no reports from major trading nations such as the 
United States, the European Union or Japan that they have 
ratified the pact. 
  "it would be incomprehensible for the United States not to 
ratify the pact in time," he said. 
  The Clinton administration has set August 15 as the deadline 
for congressional approvals. Sutherland said "it is the 
leadership role as signified by President Clinton that the 
ratification is made". 
  On the resumption of China's GATT membership, Sutherland 
termed it as a priority for GATT Secretariat. "It is true to say 
that a World Trade Organization without China as part of it is 
less than a complete organization," he emphasized. 
  He said the negotiations on the subject have reached a 
"decisive phase", as there is "a demanding schedule" for a 
protocol to be agreed by the summer time. 
  Although there is a widespread recognition that significant 
(trade) liberalization steps have recently taken place in China, 
the contracting parties still "have legitimate and serious 
demands which have to be recognized and understood by China", he 
said, adding "it will require will and cooperation and 
constructive dialogue of everybody". 
  "We'll give the utmost importance to it and will press 
forward the negotiations," he said.

<F P=106> [By reporter Liu Yuanda (0491 6678 6671)] </F>
  [Text] Kunming, 24 May (XINHUA) -- China's first nine 
enterprises successfully placed their shares on markets outside 
the mainland. Liu Hongru, a noted economist and chairman of the 
China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee, 
praised them as "file leaders" in our country's economic 
restructuring. 
  A few days ago, the State Economic Restructuring Commission 
and the China Securities Supervision and Administration 
Committee sponsored a forum on experiences in placing shares in 
outside-the- mainland markets at the Kunming Machine Tools 
Company Ltd. More than 50 representatives from the nine 
enterprises which had successfully placed their shares in 
outside-the-mainland markets, relevant departments under the 
State Council, the Shenzhen Securities Exchange, law firms, and 
other units reviewed and discussed the work in this regard. 
  With the approval of the State Council, the Shanghai 
Petrochemical Company, the Yizheng Chemical Fiber Company, the 
Qingdao Beer Company, the Maanshan Iron and Steel Company, the 
Kunming Machine Tools Company, the Guangdong Shipyard in 
Guangzhou, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company, the (?Beijing 
People's Machinery Company) [bei ren ji 0554 0086 2623], and 
Tianjin's Bohai Company issued stocks outside the mainland last 
year. Now Dongfang is still selling its stocks, and the other 
eight companies have already raised a total of more than 10 
billion Hong Kong dollars. Judging from subscriptions for its 
shares outside the mainland, the Dongfang Electric Motor Company 
is doing well in this regard. These companies have raised so 
much money in such a short time. It is unprecedented in China. 
This has not only solved the problems of funds for the nine 
companies, but also opened a major channel for Chinese 
enterprises to raise funds from the international market. 
  These nine enterprises are our country's "file leaders" in 
connecting Chinese enterprises with the international market. 
They have played an exemplary role in changing operating 
mechanisms and bringing about profound changes in their 
behavior. Of all the stock companies, the nine have done a 
better job in changing their operating mechanisms. They have 
changed from acting according to administrative directives to 
acting according to laws and regulations and from focusing their 
attention on the government to focusing their attention on the 
market, especially the international market. They have sought a 
better way for the state sector of the economy to adapt to the 
market economy.

  [Text] Wuhan, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Mikerf Woerinsd, a World 
Bank adviser, said that the equipment and the technology for 
producing iodized-salt in central China's Hubei Province have 
reached world advanced level. 
  He made the remark after heading a four-member delegation, 
entrusted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to 
investigate the salt industry in Yingcheng city and Yunmeng 
county of Hubei, in the middle of this month. 
  The two areas are ideal centres for producing iodized salt, 
according to the mission. The two areas should expand projects 
for producing edible iodized salt, in a bid to meet the demands 
for iodized salt of China's 450 million people in the country's 
iodine-deficient areas and help China to realize its target to 
wipe out completely by the year 2000 all the diseases caused by 
iodine deficiency. 
  Hubei is one of China's leading producers of salt from 
mines, 
and most of Hubei's salt production centers are located in areas 
between Yingcheng city and Yunmeng county. 
  Along areas between these two, there are ten large and 
medium- sized salt-making enterprises, producing 2.1 million 
tons of crude salt a year. 
  Hubei began production of iodized salt in the 1960s.

  [Text] Washington, May 24 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Senator Max 
Baucus and three other members of Congress today urged President 
Clinton to stay away from trying to impose partial sanctions on 
China. 
  With the deadline approaching for the U.S. President to 
decide whether to extend unconditionally most-favored-nation 
(MFN) trade status for China, the four congressmen sent a letter 
to Clinton expressing their hope that he will "avoid a political 
compromise that is likely to prove unworkable, and instead make 
a clean break with the debate of the past and renew MFN 
completely." 
  The letter outlined their concerns over a so-called 
"targeted, half-way or partial sanctions" approach, which is 
reportedly under consideration by some administration officials. 
"We see very serious substantive problems with this idea and do 
not believe it should be undertaken without a full review of the 
proposal in the normal legislative process," they said. 
  Baucus, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International 
Trade and an outspoken advocate of a policy of de-linking human 
rights and China's MFN, met with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher this morning to press him on the points in the 
letter. 
  He has said repeatedly that if a partial sanctions bill were 
to be introduced, it could not pass the Senate. 
  President Clinton told reporters that he would announce his 
decision on China's MFN status within a week. "We still have not 
only ongoing negotiations with Congress, but with others as 
well," he said. "There are a number of things that still have to 
be resolved. We're working through it as quickly as we can."

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"U.S. President Makes `A Mess' of It"] 
  [Text] A report by the London-based International 
Institute of Strategic Studies uses the term "a mess" to 
describe the U.S. President's foreign policy. We believe this 
description has not aroused controversy in the United States or 
the world. 
<H5>  The Result of Talking Irresponsibly </H5>
  The report vividly points out that Clinton seems to proceed 
without a "steady compass." In other words, he does not have an 
orientation in his work but fluctuates from side to side. This 
description is quite correct. 
  Take his Haiti policy for example. Some people estimate that 
Clinton has changed it four times, and he is now pursuing his 
fifth Haiti policy. On Haitian refugees, for example, at first 
he said the United States would accommodate all Haitian 
refugees, but later pointed out that Haitian refugees should all 
be repatriated. Now he has changed his mind by saying that 
Haitian refugees should be screened at sea and only genuine 
political refugees will be accepted. If the current UN embargo 
does not work, Clinton will decide whether the United States 
should dispatch troops. It would not be strange at all for him 
to change policy. 
  There are many reasons why Clinton's foreign policy is 
changeable. Before Clinton became president, he was the 
governor of remote Arkansas, without any experience of 
diplomacy. But during the presidential campaign against 
President Bush, who had rich diplomatic experience, he 
irresponsibly made one commitment after another to show that he 
had his own views on diplomacy. Facing the political realities 
of the country and overseas, he has now discovered that the 
situation is not as simple as he expected. It is only too 
natural for him to revise his policies after hitting a wall. 
His policies toward Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and China are 
always changeable. An analyst summed it up: It is not hard to 
know what Clinton's next step is; if he makes a left now, he 
will make a right next. 
<H5>  Several Tests He Will Face </H5>
  Some critics point out that Clinton is not good at diplomacy 
and is unwilling to spend time studying it. Naturally, he has 
made "a mess" of diplomacy. But in the weeks to come, Clinton 
is likely to have no alternative but to spend effort and time on 
diplomacy. There are some knotty problems, including China's 
most-favored-nation status, nuclear inspections in Korea, 
whether or not force will be used against Haiti, whether or not 
the embargo on Bosnia's muslims should be lifted, and how to 
reopen economic dialogue with Japan, all of which require 
decisions. Diplomacy is a time-consuming job. Next week, 
Clinton will go to Europe to attend the 50th anniversary of the 
Normandy landings, and in July he will go to Europe again to 
participate in the G-7 summit. In the past, Clinton avoided 
conscription, but now he is going to Europe to attend a World 
War II commemoration as U.S. President. This has been 
criticized by people. People also compare his participation 
with Reagan's presence 10 years ago at the 40th anniversary of 
the Normandy landings. How many points he will get has drawn 
people's attention. 
<H5>  More Than Half Are Dissatisfied With His Diplomatic </H5>
Performance 
  A recent public opinion poll suggests that only 40 percent 
of 
Americans find Clinton's diplomatic performance acceptable; 53 
percent are dissatisfied. But this is not Clinton's worst 
aspect. He got his lowest approval scores for his character. 
After consecutive disclosures about sex and private investment 
scandals, only 56 percent of people said he had the loyalty and 
honesty required to be President. This was a 20 percent drop 
compared with the period just after he became President. But 
this may not be his lowest point. If the sexual harassment case 
filed by Paula Jones is pursued and the President stands in the 
dock, no one can dare say how much further his reputation will 
decline.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Smith Kline, the fifth 
largest American pharmaceuticals and medical products company, 
has invested four million U.S. dollars in Tianjin ten years ago 
and had made a total of 460 million yuan (about 50 million U.S. 
dollars) in profits by the end of last year. 
  As China's second-largest pharmaceutical enterprise, the 
Tianjin Smith Kline Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. is expected to 
record another 670 million yuan in sales this year. 
  Occupying seven ha of land in the eastern suburbs of the 
north China port city of Tianjin, the Sino-U.S. joint venture 
is composed of a preparation plant and a raw materials plant. 
The highway linking Tianjin with the factory was built 
specially by Tianjin municipality for the enterprise. 
  With advanced technology from the American pharmaceutical 
giant, the venture has developed several products which have 
become household names across China, doubling its sales volume 
since 1990. 
  So far, the joint venture has established over 100 sales 
offices in 25 provinces and municipalities across China. Most 
of the sales representatives have received special training from 
the American company. 
  "Our unique method in sales is one of the most important 
reasons for our success," said Zhang Zhi, deputy general manager 
of the company, adding that the enormous Chinese market has 
proved ideal for the method. 
  According to Zhang, the company will put a series of new 
products onto the Chinese market this year so as to maintain its 
competitiveness here.

  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian Minister of 
Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov said here today that 
trade between Russia and China would grow healthier, despite the 
current decline. 
  In an exclusive interview with XINHUA on the eve of Russian 
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China, Davydov 
said that since 1992, trade between Russia and China had been 
growing rapidly thanks to the economic reforms and encouraging 
policies being pursued by both nations. 
  He said that the volume of two-way trade reached 7.68 
billion 
U.S. dollars in 1993, a 30.9 percent increase over 1992. 
  He noted that China had become Russia's second largest 
trading partner and that Russia ranked seventh on China's list 
of international trading partners. 
  In the first quarter of this year, however, trade between 
the 
two nations for various reasons saw a decline, he said. 
  But the minister went on to say that he was confident that 
there were bright prospects for a growth in trade and that the 
trade relations in general would continue to improve. 
  He stressed that the two sides should take steps to solve 
the 
problems affecting the development of trade between them. 
  He suggested that Russia and China amend their trade 
agreements to suit the different situation and that the central 
banks play a greater role in trade between the two nations.

  [Text] Moscow, May 23 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese diplomat said 
here today that Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's 
coming visit to China, like other visits paid by leaders of the 
two countries, will further promote the development of bilateral 
economic and trade ties. 
  Economic and trade cooperation between China and Russia has 
its geographical superiority and is economically complementary, 
Hu Chusheng, minister-level economic and commercial counsellor 
at the Chinese Embassy in Russia, told XINHUA and ITAR-TASS 
reporters on the eve of Chernomyrdin's trip to Beijing. 
  Sino-Russian trade, developed on the basis of Sino-Soviet 
trade, is growing rapidly with a great potential, Hu said. 
  According to the counsellor, the volume of Sino-Russian 
trade 
was 7.68 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, compared with 5.6 billion 
dollars in 1992. 
  The Sino-Soviet trade turnover in 1991 was only 3.8 billion 
dollars. 
  Hu attributed the thriving bilateral trade to the 
stimulative 
policies adopted by the two governments, especially to the 
preferences granted to each other regarding trade. 
  On the geographical superiority, the counsellor said that 
there is little difference between the CIF [cost, insurance, and 
freight] and FOB [free on board] prices because the two 
countries are so close to each other. 
  As a result, an average of 30 dollars is saved for one ton 
of 
freight, he said. 
  On the complementary nature of Sino-Russian trade, Hu said 
Russia's heavy industrial products such as automobiles and 
planes are welcomed in China while Chinese light industrial 
goods sell well in Russia. 
  The counsellor was optimistic over the future development of 
bilateral trade, saying that he agreed to the prediction made by 
Russian businessmen that the annual volume of trade between 
China and Russia will surpass 10 billion dollars. 
  It is very hard to achieve the goal this year as the volume 
of delivery dropped by more than 50 percent in the first two 
months this year over the same period last year, he stressed. 
  Hu attributed the fall to the delay in signing some inter- 
governmental trade protocols, higher import taxes imposed by 
Russia and its new arrangement in granting visas. 
  He believed that all these issues can be resolved through 
consultations. 
  He expressed the hope that Chinese and Russian businessmen 
will deepen their mutual understanding and trust as bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation grows.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporters Wan Chengcai (8001 2052 </F>
2088) and Zhang Tiegang (1728 6993 6921): "Friendly Relations 
and Cooperation on the Bank of the Amur River"] 
  [Text] Moscow, 22 May (XINHUA) -- On a sunny day in May, 
we flew more than 8,500 kilometers southeast from Moscow and 
arrived in Khabarovsk (Boli), a Russian border city of strategic 
importance on the bank of the Amur River, for a 10-day reporting 
trip in the Russian Ear East. 
  The Amur is a river on the Sino-Russian border, and 
Khabarovsk City is located on the northern bank on the middle 
reaches of the river. During the years when relations between 
the two countries were tense, this was the frontier of military 
confrontation filled with the smoke of gunpowder. Today, border 
trade and various forms of economic cooperation have replaced 
conflicts, turning the Amur River into a river of friendship 
that links the feelings of the two peoples. 
  The Khabarovsk border region is graced with enchanting 
sights, covers an area of 824 square kms, and has a population 
of more than 2 million, 80 percent of which lives in the city 
proper. Densely forested, the area abounds in such resources as 
coal, zinc, and gold. Its industry is dominated by metallurgy, 
machine-building, aircraft manufacturing, electric cable 
production, petroleum refining, and woodworking, while fishery, 
deer-raising, and commercial hunting are also booming sectors. 
On top of the fairly developed shipping and air transportation 
services, the trunk line of the celebrated Trans-Siberian 
Railway crisscrosses the southern part of the region. 
Khabarovsk, with a population of 600,000, is the capital of the 
border region, as well as the largest industrial city and one of 
the transportation hubs in the Far East. 
  In Russia's drive for economic reform, the Amur River has 
taken the lead in opening up to the outside world. Pisarenko 
[name as received], deputy director of the region's Foreign 
Economic Liaison Bureau, told us: The Khabarovsk border region 
has established economic cooperation and trade with 42 countries 
and regions, of which China is the largest economic and trade 
partner. 
  Pisarenko said exuberantly: The trade volume between the 
Khabarovsk border region and China accounted for 45 percent of 
the region's total foreign trade volume in 1993, rising by 340 
percent from $115 million in 1992 to $391 million in 1993. The 
trade structures of the two sides complement each other, with 
the border region primarily exporting steel products, plants and 
equipment, nonferrous metals, and timber to China, and importing 
daily necessities and food from the latter. The female deputy 
director said: Following the termination of the border region's 
traditional economic ties with western Russia and the CIS 
countries, rail freight has risen steadily, rendering the 
region's economic relations and trade with China increasingly 
important in the absence of self-sufficiency in industrial and 
agricultural production. 
  What we witnessed here is not only the conduct of barter 
trade with China, but also a growing interest on both sides in 
the establishment of joint ventures. By January this year, 199 
Chinese-funded enterprises had been established in the border 
region, accounting for 45 percent of the total number of 
foreign-funded enterprises. Of these, 144 are joint ventures, 
and 55 are wholly Chinese-owned. Registered assets total $11 
million, or 10 percent of the region's total foreign registered 
assets. Moreover, experienced Chinese vegetable growers and 
construction workers have begun to demonstrate their skills in 
the Khabarovsk border region. 
  The reporters visited the largest country market in 
Khabarovsk City. Several thousand stalls were neatly arrayed in 
this market covering an area of some 20,000 square meters, where 
vendors hawked their wares incessantly and customers jostled 
each other. Most of the goods were clothing and other daily 
necessities. In addition to local people, stall proprietors 
included Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian nationals. 
The local official accompanying us on the trip said: 
High-quality and inexpensive daily necessities and food 
produced by China have greatly enriched the border region's 
market; however, the reputation of Chinese goods has also been 
sullied by some poor-quality commodities. The local government 
official said: Most of the Chinese-funded enterprises in the 
region carry out trading activities, and the number of 
enterprises engaged in commodity production is too small. 
  Quoting Peter the Great during an interview with these 
reporters, the Russian presidential representative in the 
Khabarovsk border region, said: "The more a country conducts 
foreign trade, the better its people's lives will become." He 
expressed the hope that people on both sides of the river, who 
have a century-old history of border trade, would further expand 
mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade. 
  With the clouds illuminated by the setting sun, the 
picturesque Amur River seemed to be singing the song of 
long-running friendship between people on both sides of the 
river.

  [Text] Moscow, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Moscow's key 
policy-making body, the Russian Security Council, was expanded 
today to include Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Lower House of the 
Parliament, as its ninth member under a decree of President 
Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Presidential Press Office announced the order to the 
ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY this morning and said the decision was 
based on the country's constitution. 
  Many of Russia's important policies have been worked out 
with 
the counsel of the Security Council, which is directly under 
Yeltsin's leadership. Since a Yeltsin-proposed reshuffle in 
February, the council had had eight members including ministers 
of defense, foreign and home affairs as well as heads of the 
country's intelligence departments.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, a Chinese 
Communist Party leader, today expressed the hope for further 
development of long-term and good-neighborly relations between 
China and the Republic of Korea (ROK). 
  This conforms not only to the fundamental interests of the 
two peoples, but also to peace, stability and development in the 
north-eastern Asia and the rest of the region, he said. 
  Hu, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and 
member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made 
these remarks at a meeting with Mun Chung-su, secretary-general 
of the Democratic Liberal Party Central Committee of the ROK, 
here this afternoon. 
  Noting that China and the ROK are close neighbors and their 
peoples' contacts can be traced back to ancient times, Hu said 
the two countries had not long established diplomatic ties, but 
bilateral ties have developed rapidly and their exchanges and 
cooperation covered a wide range. 
  He added that the friendly contacts between the two parties 
have also been expanding. 
  Mun praised China for its stability and rapid economic 
development, adding that it is his hope that the visit will help 
increase his understanding of China's reform, opening to the 
outside world and modernization and promote the growth of the 
ties between the two parties and the two countries. 
  Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of 
the CPC Central Committee, attended the meeting. 
  This evening, Tian Jiyun, member of the Political Bureau of 
the CPC Central Committee and vice-chairman of China's National 
People's Congress Standing Committee, hosted a banquet in honor 
of the visitors. 
  The ten-member delegation, including six members of the 
national assembly, arrived here earlier this afternoon. 
  Tomorrow morning Li Shuzheng is expected to hold working 
talks with Mun and his party on relations between the two 
parties. 
  After their visit to Beijing, the delegation will also pay 
goodwill visits to Xian and Shanghai.

<F P=106> [By Chai Ling, a student leader of the 1989 pro-democracy </F>
movement in Tiananmen Square, now chairing the China Dialogue 
Foundation] 
  [Text] United States President Bill Clinton's China policy 
is caught in a dilemma between human rights and trade relations. 
Last year he signed an executive order requiring that "China 
improve its human rights significantly" before he will renew its 
Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status. 
  To show his commitment, he invited several Tiananmen Square 
students, including myself, to witness the signing ceremony. 
  In the past year, the Chinese Government has responded with 
some improvements, but there are still many human rights abuses 
such as arrests of political dissidents and the use of prison 
and slave labour. Now Mr Clinton is considering his next policy 
move towards China. 
  I would like to suggest that, rather than revoking China's 
MFN status, he should form a bilateral human rights commission. 
  As a student leader who survived the Tiananmen massacre, I 
strongly believe human rights and economic development are 
equally important. Revoking MFN might not necessarily end 
China's dictatorship, but it would certainly hurt the people and 
the reformers more than the hardliners. Therefore that action 
should be kept as a last option. 
  The roots of China's human rights abuses lie in the lack of 
the rule of law. Thus, China "could easily roll back any 
concessions it made on human rights", as Wei Jingsheng, one of 
our prominent colleagues, has pointed out. 
  The truth is, unless China starts constitutional reform, 
setting up its own checks and balances mechanism within its 
system, it is unrealistic to expect outside pressure to change 
the situation. 
  The Chinese Constitution stipulates that the people have the 
right of speech, assembly and vote. The problem is how to uphold 
the letter of law. The only solution is to urge the Beijing 
government to start constitutional reform and to establish the 
rule of law. The first step ought to be strengthening the 
National People's Congress as a supervisory organ, to pass laws 
to stop the government from violating its own constitution and 
abusing citizens' rights. 
  Most importantly, there have been positive statements made 
by 
China's younger leaders that they are willing to start 
constitutional reform. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin, during his meeting with Mr 
Clinton in Seattle last year, mentioned that "within the law, 
there are some things we can do". On a visit to Europe earlier 
this year, Qiao Shi, head of the standing committee of the 
National People's Congress (NPC) said: "China needs to learn 
from Western countries to protect its citizens." 
  At the same time, there are signs these leaders favour a 
more 
constructive approach to U.S.- China relations. As Mr Jiang said 
during U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to 
Beijing: "In order to become friends, we must fight first." 
  This elliptical remark was explained by Lee Kuan Yew, 
Singapore's senior minister, in an interview with Time magazine. 
  According to Mr Lee, Mr Jiang's message was positive: "I 
want 
to be a friend--so we must have these quarrels. That this was 
left out of the reports in China meant that he did not want the 
Chinese people to know he was being conciliatory." 
  In a similar vein, Mr Qiao suggested to House Majority 
Leader 
Richard Gephardt during his visit to China in January that he 
hoped the NPC and Congress would increase co-operation for 
healthy U.S.-China relations. 
  Such positive signals from Chinese leaders have so far been 
ignored by the U.S. media. They are the result of President 
Clinton's MFN policy. By signalling his support for 
constitutional reform inside China and forming a bilateral human 
rights commission, the president could contribute to further 
improvement of China's human rights situation. 
  Should China agree to such a commission, that could be 
reason 
enough to extend MFN status. 
  This would not only resolve the trade versus human rights 
dilemma, it would also hold numerous benefits for U.S.-China 
relations. 
  It would be a forum to solve disagreements and avoid 
conflicts due to lack of communication. It would also help plant 
a mechanism of checks and balances into the current Chinese 
power structure and could potentially lead to China's 
democratisation. 
  Such a commission could hardly be seen as "interfering in 
China's domestic affairs" or "forcing Western human rights 
standards onto China," rather it would be a two-way forum for 
discussion of both countries' human rights problems. 
  Human rights should no longer be an annual subject of debate 
but the focus of a consistent effort to help China establish the 
rule of law. 
  Mr Qiao has already accepted U.S. congressman Tom Foley's 
invitation to visit the U.S. Congress. This would be a good 
opportunity to discuss this plan with Mr Qiao and to work out a 
timetable for setting up this bilateral human rights commission. 
  In Beijing in 1989 thousands of students and citizens 
peacefully demanded that the government establish the rule of 
law and stop corruption; respect the constitution with 
guaranteed freedom of speech, assembly and vote. It was not an 
uprising but a movement similar to the civil rights movement in 
the U.S. But a few hardliners ordered in tanks and troops and 
massacred thousands of innocent people. 
  How could this kind of decision possibly be made and carried 
out? 
  Had China had an influential legislature or an independently 
elected leader such as Russia's Boris Yeltsin, would this 
tragedy have been avoided? 
  If China set up a mechanism of checks and balances, could 
such tragedy be avoided in the future? 
  It is five years since Tiananmen. After escaping from China, 
living in the U.S. and studying at Princeton University, I am 
more convinced than ever that China's future is through 
constitutional reform. I don't agree with extremist theories 
that, once international pressure is increased, the Chinese 
Government will collapse overnight or that, once China starts 
political reform, chaos will begin. 
  I am glad I have found that many Chinese people both within 
China and overseas agree with me. I also sincerely hope that the 
Clinton administration will be able to avoid extremist 
approaches and decide upon a China policy that pursues both 
human rights and economic interests. 
  This, I believe, is the solution to the dilemma of 
U.S.-China 
relations.

<F P=106> [Article by dissident Wei Jingsheng written in Xiaoxitian, </F>
Beijing, on 29 December 1993: "How To Invest in China -- To 
Ensure Their Economic Interests, Foreigners Should Make 
Political Investments First"] 
  [Text] Normally, whoever plans to do business should 
accumulate experiences, learn the knack from others, and, when 
he has some certainty of success, then proceed to risk his or 
someone else's money. Few people do business by following 
professors' guidance, and still fewer businessmen consult 
politicians. This is because what professors can tell you and 
what politicians can help you with are already guaranteed and 
relatively fixed things in this society or economic environment; 
that is, the constants and invariable factors in economic 
activity. What really requires the talent and wisdom of 
entrepreneurs or, in other words, what contains both risks and 
opportunities are the variables that are relatively unfixed and 
that do not have or cannot have any element of security. 
  All talented entrepreneurs attain major successes by giving 
play to their foresight and judgment in the elusive fields, or 
by a fluke. To put this issue in a different light, the more 
security the economic system (not just the market) and the legal 
system of a country or society can offer, the fewer domains of 
risk and the smaller the risks. Such an environment gives more 
security not only to the income of wage earners, but also to the 
benefits of entrepreneurs and businessmen, because entrepreneurs 
and businessmen can concentrate their time and energy on a 
relatively small number of variable fields; their efficiency can 
certainly increase in direct proportion; and their luck will 
also improve in direct proportions, though not everybody will 
have good luck. 
  The development history of the developed countries 
illustrates this point very well. By lateral comparison, it 
might be hard to draw a simple, clear, and revealing conclusion 
due to obscuring factors, such as culture, traditions, history, 
geography, resources, and varying population quality of 
different countries. Some professors like to describe things in 
the most complicated way and take the least lucid approach, as 
it helps them publish voluminous monographs and reduce the 
number of critics (through making the readers confused and 
disorientated by lengthy and dull academic writings and 
therefore unable to make head or tail of what the critics are 
talking about). However, to avoid letting opportunities slip 
by, businessmen and those who administer a country must solve 
problems in the most lucid way and must take the simplest and 
clearest approach. Therefore, I just want to make this simple 
point on this issue: By longitudinal comparison, only when the 
authority and fairness of each country's legal system keeps 
improving can the rights and interests of the people (including 
businessmen) have increasing levels of security and can the 
people's business performance improve in direct proportion. I 
have always maintained that businessmen have varying talents 
which are not in direct proportion to their level of education, 
because those who have higher academic scores are not 
necessarily winners in the business world. 
  A review of how some countries became prosperous clearly 
indicates that economic environment and legal security are 
indispensable for each country or society to improve its 
economic performance and are also the first issue to consider 
for private investors. Whoever does not believe this can review 
or read the history of his own country's process of reaching 
prosperity again or can consult veteran businessmen who have 
gone through such a history. Most of them will agree with the 
simple conclusion I have drawn. But never consult professors 
who have voluminous academic publications to their credit. I am 
afraid that will not help you come to a correct conclusion, 
because not everybody can avoid being confused and disorientated 
by lengthy and dull reasoning like professors can. 
  China's investment environment happens to be related to our 
conclusion mentioned above: This is the very reason why China, 
a country with rich business experience, has failed to bring 
forth large numbers of entrepreneurs or successful businessmen, 
because China lacks the constants in its economic environment 
that Western countries possess and lacks an effective and fair 
legal environment -- not because the Chinese lack the talent for 
doing business or do not want to become rich. 
  Some Western businessmen arrogantly claim: "China does not 
protect its people's property from being violated, but does 
protect the property rights of us foreigners." Some canvassers 
for the Chinese Government (not just Chinese) would pledge to 
everybody by saying something like "though China's economic and 
legal environments are not good, the Chinese Government will 
give the most favorable conditions to the foreign businessmen." 
  I think those who say such things are all liars or at least 
lack judgment and foresight. If you risk your money or others' 
money according to their prediction which reflects a lack 
judgment, the risk will certainly be many times greater than 
that in your own country. Because ordinary people are used to 
judging situations by referring to the experience they have 
gained in their own countries, there are always people who will 
be duped, just like someone accustomed to the wealthy life-style 
in a Western country finds it hard to imagine how a Chinese 
person can live on an annual income of a few dozen U.S. dollars 
or a businessman who is used to operating in a Western society 
with legal security finds it hard to imagine what kind of risk 
is involved in a country like China, which has no legal 
security. In fact, if I am to give a list of risks that you may 
encounter, it will be as lengthy as a professor's monograph. I 
can only tell you this in the simple manner that we are 
accustomed to: When you have security, it is easy for you to 
know what kind of security exists; when you have no security, 
generally speaking, it is impossible for you to realize all the 
risks that will come up. 
  Moreover, by common sense reasoning, one can easily see 
that, 
for a government that is not prepared to create a good economic 
environment for its own people, the favors it extends to 
foreigners means unfair treatment for its own people. Even if 
this policy truly can ensure the materialization of this kind of 
favor over a long period of time, the people of this country 
will not be able to tolerate such unfair treatment for a very 
long time. They will use all possible means to change such 
unfair treatment. As is well known, past history tells us that, 
whenever there is a major change in society, many extremely 
unfair things will turn to the other extreme. In other words, 
unfairness will transfer from the country's own people to 
foreigners. Many facts that have emerged since the beginning of 
this century have proved this, especially when foreigners 
participated in the exploitation and oppression of the country's 
own people and especially when this oppression and exploitation 
went so far as to cause the majority's hatred to override 
reason. Even the greatest politician had to give in to this 
widespread and profound retaliatory sentiment. 
  Though the Chinese are a very reasonable people, they 
require 
others to be equally reasonable. Furthermore, the Chinese have 
always despised businessmen who are solely bent on making 
profits or who are even rich and cruel. Therefore, the main 
issue in the context of investing in China is the imperious need 
to make political investment first. Helping the Chinese and 
creating a good economic environment for foreign businessmen 
themselves is the only way to provide security for everybody's 
economic interests. China's enormous market potential is very 
appealing, but if investors do not invest in helping China's 
most reasonable democratic reform forces, but instead allow 
reactionary autocratic forces or other forces that are hard to 
identify in advance determine China's future, it will be 
disadvantageous not only to the Chinese, but also to foreign 
businessmen investing in the Chinese market. This is because, 
no matter what passport you hold, you become a member of the 
Chinese economic system once you start operating in China, and 
passports mean nothing in the market. Naturally, however, if 
you want to follow the example of many individual business 
operators in China and "make a fortune and slink off before the 
communists wake up to it," you can indeed make quite a lot of 
money against your conscience. But I want to warn you: You 
better get out in time, or you may land in a mire from which you 
will not be able to pull out your legs.

<F P=106> [Report by staff reporter: "Beijing Leaders Inspect Various </F>
Localities, Political Bureau To Hold Meeting To Deal With 
Loss-Making State Enterprises and Soaring Prices"] 
  [Text] On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the 4 June 
incident, members of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau 
left Beijing to conduct "investigations and studies" in various 
localities. They have returned one after the other to Beijing 
in recent days. Reportedly, the Political Bureau will hold an 
enlarged meeting within the next few days to study the current 
political and economic situation and work out relevant 
countermeasures. 
  During the politically sensitive period in May, General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin assumed personal command in Beijing while 
vice chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen of the Central Military 
Commission inspected group armies of the navy and the ground 
forces respectively. 
  With two topics in mind, the other Political Bureau members 
left for inspection tours of other localities. 
  Following his visit to Inner Mongolia in early May to find 
out about the unity situation among various nationalities and 
the circumstances of large and medium state enterprises, Premier 
Li Peng made a five-day inspection tour of Jiangsu from 17 to 22 
May. In particular, he inspected local commodity production 
bases and large and medium-sized state enterprises. In the 
course of economic development, he urged them to maintain a 
balance between local interests and central needs. 
  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji inspected grain production and the 
grain purchase and marketing system of the Hangjiahu plain from 
late April to early May. He handled the question of cultivated 
land lying idle in the coastal areas, called for settling the 
problem through legislation, and urged the local government to 
keep prices under control. Later, he summoned an economic work 
conference of seven central plain provinces in Wuhan and 
Zhengzhou from 13 to 22 May to settle the problems in grain and 
cotton production, purchase, and marketing and to check the 
deficits of the state enterprises in these provinces. 
  Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee 
in charge of party affairs, inspected Henan's rural areas from 
14 to 18 May to specially resolve the problems of party 
organizations at the basic levels. He called on the party 
organizations to unite the masses and maintain stability. 
  Li Ruihuan, member of the Political Bureau Standing 
Committee, visited five northern European nations from 18 to 22 
May. Following a private visit to Australia and New Zealand, 
Tian Jiyun returned to China via Hong Kong on 12 May and made a 
seven-day inspection tour of Shenzhen and Guangzhou. Qian 
Qichen inspected Sichuan and Li Lanqing inspected Guangdong's 
Zhuhai while Wu Bangguo, Chen Xitong, and Jiang Chunyun made 
investigations and studies of their respective regions. 
  Following their inspection tours of various localities, it 
is 
said that the Political Bureau members will hold meetings in 
Beijing to settle state enterprise deficits, suspension of 
production, and unemployment and petitions arising from these, 
as well as the problems of a standstill in agricultural 
production, peasants allowing their fields to lie idle, 
difficulties in purchasing and selling grain and cotton, the 
issuance of IOU's, and peasants' complaints. 
  Viewed from the overall situation, the mainland's tightened 
economy has resulted in a drop in the scale of capital 
construction, investment, and other quotas. However, prices 
remain high. Despite the relaxation of contradictions, 
economists hold that there is little room to maneuver in 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and the situation is by no 
means optimistic. 
  As a matter of fact, the current political situation is 
grimmer than the economic situation. Beijing looks relaxed 
externally but is tense internally and massive forces are 
stationed there to prevent trouble. However, people in Beijing 
believe that the municipality is tranquil and no trouble is 
likely to occur. If there should be trouble, it will probably 
take place in the heavy industrial bases, areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities, and the traditional grain production 
bases. 
  According to common practice, important topics at the 
current 
enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau will include emergency 
measures adopted to deal with U.S. extension of China's 
most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, partial extension, or 
sanctions imposed on certain products.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] A major paradox of Chinese politics is that the 
titles and perquisites of would-be helmsman Jiang Zemin have 
grown at the same rate that affairs of state have become more 
rudderless. 
  In the early 1980s, New Helmsman Deng Xiaoping told 
foreigners he had no worries because his two lieutenants, then 
party boss Hu Yaobang and then premier Zhao Ziyang could 
"prevent the heavens from falling". 
  Can President and party General Secretary Jiang hold up the 
sky? Events since late last year have shown that Mr Jiang, who 
is also Chairman of the Central Military Commission [CMC] and 
head of the party's Leading Group on Finance and Economics, has 
been less than adept at preventing the ship of state from 
lunging first to port, then to starboard. 
  Such flip-flops include Beijing's half-hearted pursuit of 
the 
austerity programme in the third quarter of 1993 and so far this 
year. 
  Western economists have also been baffled by the 
authorities' 
lily-livered efforts to restructure the ailing state 
enterprises. Calls made last November for radical surgery have 
metamorphosed into Premier Li Peng's warning last week "not to 
draw an equation mark between state-owned firms and economically 
inefficient enterprises". 
  Cynics have cited Mr Jiang's lack-lustre performance as 
party 
boss and mayor of Shanghai from 1986 to 1989 and his uneventful 
stint in the Ministry of Electronics from 1982 to 1985. 
  An equally plausible explanation, however, may be that Mr 
Jiang, who is also the head of the party's Leading Group on 
Taiwan Affairs and Honorary President of the China Software 
Industry Association, might be too busy pursuing portfolios and 
peddling influence. 
  Analysts were flabbergasted to learn last month that the 
supremo had put one more feather in his cap: Honorary Chairman 
of the China Red Cross. Attempts, however, by Mr Jiang to draw 
the 3.2 million-strong People's Liberation Army (PLA) into his 
fiefdom have raised the most eyebrows. Beijing tabled bills this 
month specifying that the CMC chairman must be a cadre without 
military insignia, and that the position of first-grade general 
be abolished. This was interpreted as a move to shore up Mr 
Jiang, who has no army credentials. 
  In addition to installing cronies to key PLA slots, Mr Jiang 
has pulled out all the stops to ensure the loyalty of the 
People's Armed Police (PAP). 
  Since Tiananmen Square, the brief of the PAP, whose strength 
is estimated at 800,000, has been changed to quelling "internal 
disorders". The para-military force has thus become a potent 
weapon in the post-Deng power struggle. 
  PAP Commander Ba Zhongtan, a Jiang appointee, scandalised 
his 
less-politicised colleagues recently by asserting that the first 
duty of his force was to "protect party and state leaders", an 
unsubtle reference to mentor Mr Jiang. Analysts said General 
Ba's statement was tantamount to former Chief Political 
Commissar General Yang Baibing's claim in 1992 that the PLA's 
main task was to provide "an imperial escort" for Mr Deng's 
southern China tour, when radical reform initiatives were 
unveiled. 
  Though Mr Jiang is but a helmsman in waiting, he and his 
personal office have built up a personality cult worthy of that 
of Great Helmsman Mao Zedong. After Mr Jiang's "triumphant 
summit" with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Seattle last 
November, PLA commissars urged the generals to heap praise in 
internal meetings on the statesmanlike exploits of the 
"President of the Republic". Last June, Mr Jiang fired the chief 
editors of the People's Liberation Army Daily for lese-majeste, 
putting his interview with CNN on the back page. 
  During this year's Lunar New Year, Mr Jiang hosted a banquet 
for the editors of the national media in an apparent effort to 
boost his already ubiquitous profile. Chinese journalists say 
that not since Chairman Mao has a top cadre issued so many 
personal directives to newspapers and TV stations. 
  The President's most recent instruction to party and media 
is 
reportedly an eight-point exhortation on preventing unrest, 
boosting agriculture, pacifying laid-off workers, and curbing 
corruption. Yet like all Jiang-inspired propaganda, the edict 
bore this overriding theme: highlight the president's status as 
the "core" of the new leadership and Mr Deng's anointed heir. 
  Which leads us to a paradox in recent Chinese history: 
unlike 
Mr Hu or Mr Zhao, Mr Jiang was not Mr Deng's personal choice as 
successor. In the heady days of the 1989 "turmoil", Mr Deng 
acquiesced in the recommendation of conservative elders such as 
Li Xiannian and Chen Yun that "trustworthy Marxist" Mr Jiang 
took over from Mr Zhao. 
  From then till the death of his chief patron Mr Li in 
mid-June, Mr Jiang displayed his expertise at what the Chinese 
call fengpei ("Wind Faction") politics by bending now with the 
New Helmsman and now with the former state president. 
  His "protege's" failure to help propagate a new wave of 
reform was a key reason why Mr Deng needed to go south in early 
1992 to proselytize to Guangdong's capitalist roaders. 
  Luck, which is as important to Mr Jiang's rise as palace 
intrigues, however, is with the president. 
  After Mr Li's death, the Wind Faction affiliate knew his 
fate 
was linked with that of Mr Deng. And Mr Jiang began at least to 
make the right noises about market reforms. 
  A senior Chinese source said if Mr Li had died a year later 
-- and Mr Jiang gone on with his duplicitous game of pleasing 
two masters -- Mr Deng would have dumped him in late 1992 or 
early 1993. 
  By late 1993, however, a pathetically frail Mr Deng had 
become a hostage of history. With "stability" uppermost in his 
mind, the patriarch could not but continue to funnel support to 
one of the few leaders who had sworn he would never overturn the 
verdict on June 4. 
  Also by then, however, it had become apparent that the 
mantle 
thrust upon Mr Jiang was way too big for the 68-year-old. It is 
Mr Jiang who, playing fengpai politics to the hilt, is 
responsible for some of the most maddening tergiversations in 
policy. 
  The first signal that the retrenchment policy of 
Vice-Premier 
Zhu Rongji was being watered down came when, visiting southern 
China last September, Mr Jiang told the local "warlords" they 
could again go for no-holds-barred development. 
  On the eve of the watershed party Third Plenum last 
November, 
a pro-Beijing paper in Hong Kong trumpeted how Mr Jiang helped 
to "liberate our thoughts" by no longer insisting that state 
enterprises be the mainstay of the economy. 
  The shift to bailing out the dinosaurs, however, was also 
made by Mr Jiang, who told cadres in Shanxi province in February 
that Beijing would "provide necessary assistance and support" to 
the country's least efficient sector.

<F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123) and TIANJIN </F>
RIBAO reporter Wang Hong (3769 1347)] 
  [Text] Tianjin, 19 May (XINHUA) -- While inspecting work 
in Tianjin, Qiao Shi, member of the Standing Committee of the 
CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and chairman of the 
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, stressed 
that it is necessary to take advantage of the opportunity that 
the international and domestic situations are favorable to 
China's modernization drive, deepen reform in a down-to-earth 
way, open wider to the outside world, and promote development. 
  From 15 to 18 May, Qiao Shi, accompanied by comrades Gao 
Dezhan, Li Jianguo, Li Shenglin, and Nie Bichu, inspected 
Tianjin Steel Tube Company, Tianjin Mini Automobile Plant, 
Tianjin Forging Press Plant, Changcheng Television Company 
Limited, Honda Motorcycle Company Limited, and Xiaonanhe Duck 
Farm in Xiqing District. He also visited the Tianjin 
Broadcasting and Television Tower. While in Tianjin, Qiao Shi 
heard work reports made by the municipal party committee and 
government and held a discussion meeting with the principal 
leaders of the municipal people's congress standing committee. 
  As Tianjin is the largest open coastal city in north China, 
Qiao Shi shows great concern for its reform, opening up to the 
outside world, and economic development. He said: Since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Tianjin 
has done a good job in making an early start in opening to the 
outside world. As a result, it has achieved faster and better 
results in developing its economy. So long as it advances in a 
pioneering spirit, deepens reform, and opens up wider to the 
outside world on the basis of its current foundation, Tianjin 
will achieve better results in development and will be able to 
play an important role in promoting opening up and economic 
development in China's northern region. 
  Expressing concern for the implementation of reform 
measures, 
he said: The current international situation is developing in a 
direction favorable to China's development. Domestically, China 
enjoys social stability and the economy is growing in a 
sustained way. The general situation is good. We must seize 
this rare historical opportunity and deepen reform in a 
down-to-earth way. Since the fourth quarter of last year, big 
strides in reform have been taken with the introduction of more 
reform measures. This is absolutely necessary, and the 
direction is correct. Practice has proved that the results are 
good. Regarding the implementation of these reform measures, we 
still have a lot of practical work to do. With regard to the 
specific problems encountered in the course of deepening reform, 
we should, after investigations and studies, solve them one by 
one according to the order of urgency. Only thus can we 
thoroughly implement reform measures. Leaders at all levels and 
cadres must understand the strategic significance of the reform 
measures drawn up by the party Central Committee, and lead the 
masses of people to vigorously push forward our reform cause. 
  As state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises account 
for 
a large part of Tianjin's industry, Qiao Shi seriously inquired 
about their conditions. He fully affirmed the merit of the 
Tianjin leadership in attaching importance to deepening the 
reform of enterprises. He said: To improve state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises, leaders must pay attention to 
these enterprises, strive to solve some crucial problems for 
them, guide them to compete in the market, and encourage them to 
deepen reform, to enliven their operating mechanisms, and to 
raise efficiency. We should encourage enterprises to study and 
introduce advanced technologies and management experiences. 
Through reform and studying advanced experiences, enterprises 
will be able to upgrade the quality and level of their 
equipment, technology, products, and management. We should 
enhance the skills of workers through various forms of training. 
We must strive to reduce enterprises' burden by establishing, 
step by step, a social insurance system, so as to create a good 
condition and environment for enterprises to develop. 
State-owned large and medium-sized enterprises will show great 
vitality in market competition after they truly improve their 
operating mechanisms and enhance economic efficiency. 
  Turning to agricultural issues, Qiao Shi stressed: China is 
a huge country with a large population. We must never slacken 
the production of major farm products such as grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops. At the same time, we should also develop a 
diversified economy in light of local conditions. In suburban 
areas, particular attention should be given to the "vegetable 
basket project." Qiao Shi said: We should regard the surplus 
labor in rural areas as an important resource and make use of it 
through different ways. For example, we should organize them to 
build roads and water conservation facilities. He also said: 
The development of village and town enterprises and the 
building of small towns step by step will further change the 
outlook of China's countryside. At the same time, the surplus 
labor will have an important role to play in the course of 
construction. 
  During a discussion meeting with the principal leaders of 
the Tianjin Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, Qiao 
Shi said: Tianjin has done a great deal of work to improve 
socialist democracy and strengthen the legal system. I hope 
Tianjin will strengthen studies and do a better job in this 
regard. He stressed: Strengthening democracy and the legal 
system is very important to the smooth progress of modernization 
and the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
People's congresses bear heavy responsibilities in making laws, 
in exercising supervision, and in doing other fields of work. 
We must work hard and strive to gradually establish a framework 
for a legal system for a socialist market economy. People's 
congresses at all levels should forge close ties with the 
masses, expand democracy, proceed from fundamental interests of 
the people and the state, conscientiously exercise their 
functions, strictly observe laws, and carry out their role 
fully. Qiao Shi expressed the hope that in the course of making 
laws, exercising supervision, and doing other work, local 
people's congresses should vigorously make explorations, sum up 
new experiences, proceed from reality, and go on playing their 
role and making innovations. People's congresses at all levels, 
particularly grass-roots people's congresses, should make 
constant efforts to strengthen themselves to meet the needs of 
work. 
  Qiao Shi said: So long as we stick to the central task of 
economic construction, adhere to the party's basic line, 
earnestly grasp two links, and effectively develop the economy 
to raise the people's living standards step by step, we will be 
able to gradually solve the problems we are experiencing. 
Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, if we conscientiously implement 
the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we will be 
able to realize the strategic objective of quadrupling our GNP 
by the end of this century and to lay a sound foundation for 
development in the next century.

  [Text] During his 21-22 May inspection trip to Hubei, Qian 
Qichen, vice premier of the State Council, expressed his desire 
to to see Hubei seize the opportunity to open up and develop 
along the Chang Jiang, open wider to the outside world, and 
accelerate development to effectively contribute to the strategy 
of opening up and developing the Chang Jiang area. [Video 
begins with long shots of Qian Qichen walking with a crowd of 
unidentified people] 
  While in Hubei, Comrade Qian Qichen successively went right 
to the mountainous regions in western Hubei and to Yichang City 
to survey the localities' opening up and development on the 
spot. He also heard reports on how Hubei Province properly 
handles the relationship between reform, development, and 
stability; ensures social stability; and maintains favorable 
trends in economic development. [Video shows long shots of Qian 
Qichen watching a television screen and later, standing on a 
boat which appears to be moving along a river.] 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: Hubei has a very prominent, 
strategic position in the strategy to open up and develop the 
area along the Chang Jiang. The province should further step up 
the pace of opening up and development, work in concert with 
Pudong from an advanced level, and promote and serve as a hub 
for rapid economic development in inland regions along the Chang 
Jiang.

  [Text] Hefei, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Chinese State Councillor 
Song Jian has urged local governments in the Huaihe River Valley 
to take effective measures to curb pollution which has severely 
affected this river in east China. 
  The river water must become clean again by the end of this 
century so that the river can again benefit local people living 
along its banks, he said today at a meeting to check on the 
environmental protection of the Huaihe River Valley. 
  Local enterprises that run at low economic efficiency and 
cause serious pollution but lack efficient measures to curb 
pollution must be closed or switch to other products with less 
pollution, he said. Those enterprises that bring heavy pollution 
but are able to harness pollution must do it within a limited 
period. 
  In addition, urban sewage treatment facilities must be built 
in a group of cities, the state councillor said. The Huaihe 
River Water Resources Protection Organization, formed by 
departments of the four provinces concerned and departments of 
the State Council, should be further improved and a supervising 
network on the pollution of the Huaihe River be established. 
  The third largest river in China, the Huaihe River runs 
across four provinces -- Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu -- 
its drainage area covering 269,000 sq km, with population 
topping 150 million. 
  Since the beginning of the 1980s, the main tributaries of 
the 
river and the river proper became increasingly contaminated 
owing to a fast-growing local economy and urbanization. 
  Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, inspected many parts along the river to 
investigate the state of pollution. He also visited local 
farmers' families that have suffered from the pollution. 
  He urged local officials to cooperate with each other in 
taking comprehensive measures to ease the pollution so that a 
better environmental condition can be created for the valley in 
the 21st century.

<F P=106> ["National Fortifications-Storming Plan for Supporting 80 </F>
Million Impoverished People Over the Next Seven Years 
(1994-2000) (Excerpts)" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 May (XINHUA) -- Socialism must 
eliminate poverty. To further solve the problem of poverty in 
rural areas so as to narrow the gap between regions in east 
China and those in west China, and to achieve the goal of common 
prosperity, the State Council decided to concentrate manpower 
plus material and financial resources by mobilizing the forces 
from all walks of life from 1994 to 2000, and to strive to 
basically solve the problem of food and clothing for the 80 
million people living in poverty in rural areas across the 
country in about seven years. This is a very arduous 
fortifications-storming battle. To this end, the State Council 
drew up a "National Fortifications-Storming Plan for Supporting 
80 Million Impoverished People Over the Next Seven Years." It 
is a program for the work to be carried out nationwide over the 
next seven years to help poor areas achieve development, and 
constitutes an important integral part of our program for 
national economic and social development. 
<H5>  1. The Situation and Tasks </H5>
  It has been a consistent policy of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council to support the impoverished 
areas to change their face of poverty and backwardness as 
quickly as possible. Especially since the mid-1980's, the state 
has carried out large-scale, organized work to support the 
impoverished areas across the country in a planned way. The 
state increased input by a big margin to support the 
impoverished areas, formulated a series of help-the-poor 
policies and, furthermore, carried out fundamental reform and 
adjustment of the help-the-poor work done in the earlier period, 
thereby bringing about a change from the delivery of relief to 
the offer of support to poor areas in achieving development. 
After strenuous efforts by the state for years, the problem of 
poverty in rural areas across the country has been noticeably 
eased and the number of impoverished people whose problem of 
food and clothing remains yet to be completely and steadily 
solved has decreased to 80 million. It was a tremendous 
historical achievement and proved that the help-the-poor 
principle and policy formulated by the party Central Committee 
and the State Council were correct and fully demonstrated the 
superiority of the socialist system. 
  Though the number of people living in poverty does not 
represent a large percentage of the rural areas' total 
population across the country, the tasks to help poor areas 
achieve development are very arduous. These people mainly 
concentrate in the impoverished counties which the state focuses 
its attention on supporting. These counties are scattered over 
remote mountain areas, rocky mountain areas, deserts, high 
mountains where it is very cold, loess plateau areas, areas with 
a high incidence of endemic diseases, and dam areas. Their 
common characteristics are remoteness, inconvenient 
transportation, lack of proper care for ecological environment, 
sluggish economic development, shortage of potable water supply 
to people and livestock, and extremely bad production and living 
conditions. These are the main fields for our fortifications- 
storming battle to support the impoverished areas. 
  The establishment of a socialist market economic system has 
brought unprecedented opportunities and broader prospects for 
poor areas' development. Paying close attention to helping poor 
areas achieve development to solve the problem of food and 
clothing for the masses in these areas as quickly as possible, 
to change their situation of economic backwardness, and to ease 
and eradicate poverty is a great undertaking that has important 
and profound economic and political significance under the new 
situation. Therefore, governments at all levels must uphold 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, adhere to 
the principle "while giving top priority to efficiency, we must 
pay attention to fairness at the same time," and further improve 
the work of helping poor areas achieve development. 
<H5>  2. The Goals After Which We Strive </H5>
  The standards for solving the problem of food and clothing 
for the impoverished population by the end of the century: 
  -- We must attain a comparatively greater increase in the 
per 
capita net annual income of the overwhelming majority of 
impoverished households. 
  -- We must support impoverished households to create basic 
conditions for steadily solving their food and clothing 
problems. In areas where conditions permit, half to one mu of 
basic farmland with steady, high yield must be cultivated by one 
person on the average; one mu of orchard or farmland for cash 
crops must be cultivated by one household on the average; one 
worker per household must be transferred to a village and town 
enterprise or to a developed area; and, on the average, one 
household must be engaged in one agricultural project or other 
sideline production. In pastoral areas, on the average, every 
household must have a plot of fenced grassland or an "enclosure 
of grassland." Meanwhile, efforts must be made to consolidate 
and expand the achievements scored in helping poor areas promote 
development so far, and to reduce the number of people who 
relapse into poverty. 
  We must carry out construction of more infrastructure 
projects. We must basically solve the problem of shortage of 
potable water supply to people and livestock. We must build 
highways to reach the overwhelming majority of impoverished 
townships and towns as well as the localities that produce 
commodities and have rural fairs. We must make electricity 
available to all counties and to the overwhelming majority of 
impoverished townships. 
  We must change the situation of backward education, culture, 
and public health. Efforts must be made to basically popularize 
elementary education; to vigorously wipe out illiteracy among 
youngsters; to conduct adult education, vocational education, 
and technical training in a bid to enable most of our young 
workers to familiarize themselves with one or two practical 
skills; to improve conditions for medical treatment and public 
health in order that we may prevent, treat, and reduce endemic 
diseases and prevent deformities; and to strictly implement 
family planning in a bid to bring the natural growth rate of the 
population under control and within the limit set by the state. 
<H5>  3. The Guiding Principle and Measures </H5>
  Continuing to adhere to the guiding principle of supporting 
the poor through development: It is necessary to encourage 
large numbers of cadres and people in impoverished areas to work 
hard and self-reliantly and, under the state's support and by 
relying on advanced science and technology, exploit and utilize 
local resources to develop the production of commodities in 
market demand, thereby solving the problem of food and clothing, 
shaking off poverty, and becoming well off. 
  Basic measures for helping the poor in development: 
  -- Giving priority to projects for developing crop-planting, 
fish-breeding, and related processing and transportation 
industries that require small investments but can yield quick 
and good returns, cover broad areas, and directly contribute to 
the solution of the problem of food and clothing. 
  -- Actively developing resource-exploiting and 
labor-intensive village and township enterprises that can bring 
into full play the advantage of local resources while providing 
ample job opportunities to impoverished households. 
  -- Expediting the development and utilization of wasteland, 
barren mountains, uncultivated slopes, and undeveloped beaches 
and waters through the compensated lease of land or transfer of 
the land use right. 
  -- Developing the supply of labor service to developed areas 
in a planned and organized way to actively facilitate a rational 
and orderly flow of laborers from poor areas. 
  -- Helping poor areas develop by resettling a small number 
of 
villages and farm households with extraordinary difficulties in 
subsistence and development conditions. 
  Main forms for supporting the poor through development: 
  -- Exploiting local resources to develop the production of 
competitive famous-brand, special, rare, and quality goods in 
accordance with market demands. A legion of households in the 
whole area should be organized under unified planning to engage 
in the development of specialized production and to gradually 
establish large-scale commodity production bases or regional 
pillar industries. 
  -- Persisting in setting up support-the-poor economic 
entities, which combine trade, industry, and agriculture and 
which integrate production, processing, and marketing to 
contract developmental projects. Maintaining ties with both 
outside markets and local farm households, these economic 
entities should provide serialized services to farmers before, 
during, and after productive seasons; and should help the masses 
cast off poverty and become well off. 
  -- Guiding poor areas having no condition for setting up 
enterprises to bring capital and labor to invest, on a voluntary 
basis, in the development of secondary and tertiary industries 
in selected rural towns and small industrial zones having a 
better investment environment. 
  -- Expanding the exchange of cadres and economic and 
technical cooperation between poor and developed areas. 
  -- Helping poor counties set up backbone enterprises to 
overcome financial difficulties of counties and build up their 
capability for self-development, while giving priority to 
solving the problem of food and clothing. 
  -- Helping poverty-stricken disabled people with 
rehabilitation programs. 
<H5>  4. The Management and Use of Funds </H5>
  To ensure the implementation of this plan, the state's 
various budgetary funds and credits will be continued until the 
year 2000. The time limit for the funds for providing work as a 
form of relief and the special funds for the construction of the 
"sanxi" areas [the three poorest areas -- Gansu's Dingxi and 
Hexi, and Ningxia's Xijie-Haiyuan-Guyuan sector] will remain 
unchanged. The time limit for using support-the-poor credits 
for projects requiring long-term development will be extended as 
deemed necessary. 
  The State Council has decided to increase, from 1994 through 
2000, the funds for providing work as a form of relief and 
support-the-poor loans with discount interest rates. Along with 
the growth of financial revenues, the state will continue to 
increase funds to support the poor. 
  Local governments at various levels should, based on the 
work 
to help the poor, increase their support-the-poor funds year 
after year so as to ensure the realization of this plan. 
  It is necessary to readjust the regional structure of 
investing state funds to support the poor. The central 
government's credits to support the poor should be concentrated 
on the severely poverty-stricken central and western provinces 
and regions. 
  All provinces and regions concerned should make necessary 
readjustment of investing funds to support the poor based on 
this principle. 
  Central appropriations, credits, and funds for implementing 
the policy of providing relief in exchange for work should be 
spent mainly on poverty-stricken counties on the state priority 
list. Funds of relevant provincial and regional governments and 
central departments should be used in coordination with these 
funds, with impoverished villages in counties designated as 
poverty-stricken being the target areas of such funds and 
projects. Funds for scattered impoverished villages or rural 
households in counties not designated as poverty-stricken should 
be arranged by local governments. 
  Bank loans for helping the poor should be given to 
development projects that promise good economic returns and are 
capable of repaying the loans. Poverty alleviation funds from 
the treasury should be used mainly on projects that yield good 
social benefits. Additional appropriations for relief in 
exchange for work should be used on building and mending roads 
and on solving drinking water shortages. Priority should be 
given to roads linking up villages with commodity producing 
areas, rural fairs, and to roads built as support facilities for 
poverty-alleviation development projects. The three types of 
funds should be used in a well-coordinated manner to improve 
overall efficiency of fund utilization. 
  It is necessary to reform the way poverty-alleviation funds 
are used and managed by introducing a mechanism of 
self-regulation and incentive, and by tightening the fund 
auditing system. It is strictly forbidden to misappropriate 
poverty-alleviation funds; violators will be called to account. 
<H5>  5. Policy Guarantees </H5>
  -- Take the actual conditions into account in granting 
poverty-alleviation credits to impoverished households or 
economic entities set up to alleviate poverty. Conditions for 
loans may be appropriately eased for projects that yield good 
economic returns and can guarantee loan repayment. 
  -- State-owned commercial banks should set aside a certain 
amount of funds to help selected projects in poverty-stricken 
areas that yield good economic returns and are capable of 
repaying the loans. 
  -- More financial assistance and commercial credits should 
be 
given to poverty-stricken counties in the six coastal provinces 
-- Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Liaoning 
-- and to counties in other provinces and regions that only 
recently cast off the label of being poverty-stricken. The 
amount of such input should, as a general rule, not be lower 
than the support these counties used to receive from the state. 
  -- Newly established enterprises in areas designated by the 
state as "old revolutionary base areas, areas inhabited by 
minority nationalities, frontier areas, and poverty-stricken 
areas" should have all or part of their income tax returned to 
them in the first three years of operations. 
  -- Governments at all levels should list poverty-alleviation 
funds in their budgets and see to it that these funds are spent 
on help-the-poor development projects. 
  -- To alleviate the increased burden of peasants in 
poverty-stricken areas brought about by the lifting of price 
controls over capital goods and by rising grain prices, the 
provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities may use local 
grain risk funds to appropriately subsidize the impoverished 
households living off grain resold to them by the state. 
  -- In deciding on centrally or locally-funded development 
projects, favorable consideration should be given to 
poverty-stricken areas well-endowed in resources. When 
establishing large and medium-sized enterprises in a 
poverty-stricken area, central, provincial or regional 
governments should take into full account local interests and 
properly balance local and state interests. 
  -- When formulating and implementing industrial policy, the 
state should take into account the special characteristics of 
poverty-stricken areas and give them support and help 
accordingly. 
  -- We should, pursuant to the principle of preferential 
treatment, give priority to the development of import and export 
trade in poverty-stricken areas by incorporating it into the 
government plans. 
<H5>  6. Tasks of Government Departments </H5>
  Government planning, foreign and internal trade, 
agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, science, education, 
industrial, communications, labor, civil affairs, nationalities, 
cultural, public health, family planning, finance, banking, 
industrial and commercial administrations, and customs 
departments should -- in line with the general requirements of 
this plan -- formulate their own poverty-alleviation plans for 
the period of the Eighth Five-Year Plan. They should fully 
utilize their respective strengths and implement a policy of 
favorably tilting toward poverty-stricken areas in terms of 
funding, material, and technological support. They should 
implement positive measures to help poverty-stricken areas 
develop the economy pursuant to the requirements of 
poverty-alleviation development and their respective functions. 
<H5>  7. Mobilization of Society </H5>
  Central and local party and government organizations, as 
well 
as enterprises and institutions where conditions permit, should 
actively commit themselves to helping certain selected poor 
counties, and their commitment should remain unchanged for 
several years until the recipients of their assistance get rid 
of poverty. 
  All democratic parties and the federations of industry and 
commerce should take advantage of their abundant manpower and 
technological resources, and their wide connections to further 
help poor regions in scientific and technological application, 
and in the development of intellectual resources. They should 
help poor regions in personnel training, popularization of 
technologies, acquisition of information, and promotion of 
economic and technological cooperation. 
  Trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, women's 
federations, science and technology associations, and 
federations for the disabled at all levels should actively take 
part in the help-the-poor development work. 
  It is necessary to give full play to the role of the China 
Fund for Helping Poor Areas and other non-governmental 
organizations for helping poor areas. 
  Big cities such as Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, and more 
developed coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, 
Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian should each help one or 
two western provinces and regions in economic development. 
Large and medium-sized enterprises should be mobilized to take 
advantage of their superiority in technology, manpower, 
marketing, information, and materials to enter into mutually 
beneficial cooperation with poor regions; and the cooperation 
may be in various forms, such as economic cooperation, 
technological service, use of labor service, distribution of 
products, and exchange of cadres. If someone plans to set up an 
enterprise of a developmental nature in a poor region, local 
help-the-poor funds may be used in an appropriate way in support 
of the plan, and joint efforts should be made for the 
development. 
  Universities, colleges, and scientific research 
organizations 
should take full advantage of their strength in specialized 
personnel and technology to cooperate directly with poor 
regions. The cooperation, designed to raise the level of science 
and technology in poor regions, may be in such forms as signing 
of science and technology contracts, popularization of 
technologies, and selection of candidates for the posts of 
deputy heads in charge of science and technology of counties and 
townships. 
  The People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force 
should continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of 
supporting the government and cherishing the people, and help 
local people solve the problem of food and clothing and become 
well-off. 
<H5>  8. International Cooperation </H5>
  It is necessary to actively promote international exchanges 
and expand and develop cooperation with the international 
community in helping poor areas. 
  Efforts should be made to improve the investment environment 
in poor regions, and to attract, with abundance of natural 
resources and preferential policies, investors from abroad to 
come to run enterprises of a developmental nature in poor 
regions so as to promote economic development there. 
<H5>  9. Organization and Leadership </H5>
  The central departments concerned and all provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities shall be organized in a 
unified way by the State Council Leading Group for Economic 
Development of Impoverished Areas to implement this plan. 
  While all levels, particularly the provincial level, should 
assume responsibility, we should persistently practice the 
system of the provincial governor (autonomous regional chairman, 
municipal mayor) assuming full responsibility for accomplishing 
the tasks set in this plan within the prescribed time. 
  All poor counties should deem it their central task to 
undertake developmental projects and solve the problem of food 
and clothing for the people, and they should seriously 
concentrate on implementing the plan for tackling tough poverty 
problems. The Provincial (regional), prefectural (autonomous 
prefectural), and city authorities should fill and strengthen 
the leading bodies of poor counties with selected capable cadres 
who can endure hardship and have contacts with the people; they 
should keep the county leading bodies relatively stable; and 
they should regard the results in implementing the plan and 
solving the problem of food and clothing for the people as the 
major criterion for appraising the job performance of the 
leading cadres of poor counties, and for promoting those cadres. 
At the same time, efforts should be made to strengthen the 
grass-roots organizations of poor townships and poor villages, 
so that their leading bodies are capable of leading the people 
in achieving prosperity. 
  The cadres of poor regions should, as always, display the 
spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle and of sharing wealth 
and woe with the people. Before their people's basic needs in 
food and clothing are met, poor counties are prohibited from 
buying automobiles or building guesthouses, luxurious hostels or 
new office buildings, and they are not permitted to upgrade 
themselves into cities. 
  It is necessary to strengthen the organizations for 
development of poor areas at various levels and provide them 
with the necessary working conditions. Their job specifications 
and organization should match local help-the-poor development 
tasks.

<F P=106> [Fifth in series of reports: "Sights and Sounds of Chinese </F>
Prisons" by staff reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160): 
"Transformation Through Labor and the Training of Personnel" -- 
Previous installments published in the 23, 24 May China DAILY 
REPORT] 
  [Text] Beijing 24 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--When a 
foreigner visited the Shanghai Municipal Prison he found the 
following fact unbelievable: A police officer was watching a 
group of inmates, who were working with tools such as knives, 
scissors, and pliers in their hands but peacefully getting along 
with each other. 
  For this reason, the reporter asked a young police officer 
whether he had ever found such a situation scary? He said with 
a smile: "When I first came to work here, I felt somewhat tense 
but now, I am quite used to it." 
  A philosopher once said: "Labor is the most beautiful thing 
in the world." What does labor mean to criminals who have been 
deprived of their freedom? Having visited prisons in Shanghai 
and Shandong, people found that labor has transformed the world 
and men have transformed themselves through labor; those who 
used to reap without sowing can see that social wealth does not 
come easily; those who used to love ease and hate work now 
experience the joy of "reaping what one has sown"; and those who 
used to start trouble can see how precious is cooperation in 
solidarity. 
  The Chinese Government and its law enforcement organizations 
hold the view that labor is one of the basic means for 
transforming criminals and has corrected their bad habits 
through labor. However, China opposes the practice of penalizing 
criminals by means of labor or torturing and ill-treating them 
through hard labor. 
  Li Dezhu, now serving his sentence at Shanghai No. 7 
Transformation Through Labor Unit, used to work at the Grain 
Bureau in Shanghai's Jingan District. He told this reporter 
that labor in the unit was mostly in mechanized operations and 
it was not at all tiring to work there. If someone 
overfulfilled his work quota, he would be given a bonus, to a 
maximum of 50 yuan a month, and the food was not bad either. 
  The Shanghai Administration for Transformation Through Labor 
requires all prisons to give work assignments to inmates 
according to their skills when making work arrangements. The 
inmates enjoy the same treatment as workers and staffers in 
state-owned enterprises regarding not working festivals and 
holidays as well as labor protection and allowances for 
heatstroke prevention are given to them during the hot season. 
Shandong Provincial Prison is undergoing experiments with the 
five-day week work system; the inmates must purchase labor 
protective items at some appointed stores, where products 
meeting the requirements are supplied. Should an accident take 
place at work, the case will not be closed until the cause and 
responsibility have been clarified and problems arising from the 
accident resolved. 
  Currently, the behavioral points system [ji fen kao he zhi 
du 
6060 0433 5072 2702 0455 1653] is universally implemented in 
Chinese prisons. The system links the inmate's work 
accomplishments, attitude in admitting his or her crime, and 
conditions in transformation to increase or commute the penalty 
in order to conduct a quantitative assessment. Hence, there has 
been an increase in the inmates' enthusiasm for labor with 
competition in labor being developed. Some inmates who are 
found to be satisfactory in their transformation have been sent 
outside the prison to work, engage in farming, or to study on a 
trial basis so that they might be closer to the "outside world." 
  With social and economic development, there has been an 
increase in the number of economic criminal cases of 
embezzlement and accepting bribes. Most of the inmates in this 
category had intermediate or senior professional titles and were 
staffers in economic management. Aiming at their 
characteristics of being physically weak, Shanghai Municipal 
Administration for Transformation Through Labor put forward the 
principle of "educating and transforming men, nurturing and 
salvaging qualified people," to exploit the inmates' 
intelligence and encourage them to participate in invention and 
creation. In the seventh national "Spark Cup" competition for 
creations and inventions held in 1993, Shanghai's prisons won 
seven awards for their projects; six projects, including "Star 
Wars Chess" and "Automatic Rainproof Clothes Drying Rack" were 
awarded certificates for patent rights from the State Patent 
Bureau. The inmates not only enjoy the rights to the inventions 
but will also receive rewards from the transfer of patents; at 
the same time, they will be granted commutation of their 
sentence. 
  "We must open broad avenues for able people and recruit them 
without overstressing qualifications." This has actually been 
achieved in Chinese prisons. Quite a few skillful craftsmen can 
give play to their skills and mental labor is respected; those 
who have professional titles at and above intermediate levels 
are given monthly allowances. The inmates are unprecedentedly 
active in participating in technical training and studies. 
Shandong Universally has developed assessment through 
discussion for technical professional titles. One of the 
inmates received a senior technical professional title while in 
prison, creating a precedent in China's history of transforming 
criminals.

<F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang and Zhou Zongmin: "Prisons Succeed in </F>
Reforming Convicts"] 
  [Text] Good conditions and fair treatment have helped make 
China's prison system effective, a Justice Ministry official 
said yesterday. 
  The rate of ex-convicts who commit crimes after their 
release 
is less than 8 per cent, one of the lowest in the world, said 
Wang Mingdi, director of the ministry's reform-through-labour 
bureau. 
  He attributed this success to China's system of reforming 
offenders through labour and reeducation. 
  "We are always trying our best to reform them into 
productive 
citizens," he said. 
  In recent years, the government has paroled or reduced terms 
for 22 per cent of inmates for good behaviour. 
  China has 1.25 million prisoners, including 334 from abroad. 
  Felons that receive terms over 10 years or those unable to 
perform manual labour are kept in prisons. The rest are sent to 
labour camps. 
  Wang said prisoners are provided with meals and 
accommodation 
that cost the government a monthly 60 yuan ($6.90) per person. 
  For foreigners kept in Chinese jails, the government spends 
twice as much, according to statistics from the Shanghai 
Municipal Prison. 
  Those who work receive between 30 yuan ($3.45) and 60 yuan 
($6.9) a month. 
  "I am content with life here, and the food is sufficient," 
said Cheng Ying, a 21-year-old woman inmate at the Shanghai 
Women's Prison. 
  "All I want now is to better behave myself, and get out of 
prison at an earlier date," added Cheng, who was serving a 
two-year term for housing prostitution activities. 
<H5>  Better Behaviour </H5>
  All inmates in China are required to work in prison 
factories 
or attend labour reform camps. 
  "Going for work is conducive to preparing them for once they 
walk out of here," said Wang. 
  Prisoners usually work six to eight hours a day except on 
weekends and public holidays. 
  And they are also required to attend study sessions for two 
to three hours a day, Wang said. 
  This includes political and legal education, elementary 
schooling and recreational activities. 
  Libraries, reading rooms, karaoke bars and video rooms have 
also been set up for prisoners. Each year 150,000 inmates 
receive high school diplomas and 100,000 get technical 
certification from labour organizations. 
  Special groups have even been established to encourage 
inmates to play musical instruments, sing and paint. 
  Inmates from abroad also enjoy such treatment, Wang said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ren Zhongping (0117 0112 1627): "Properly </F>
Handle Contradictions Among the People in the New Situation"] 
  [Text] Contradictions among the people have existed 
universally in our social life for a long time. The real 
significance in setting out this issue today lies in the fact 
that our cause of reform is developing in depth. The reform 
measures presented this year are particularly important, because 
they will affect the underlying structure of the interests of 
various social areas in a relatively broad scope, and will 
sooner or later affect the regions, units, and individuals to 
various degrees. Just as we have seen, our social life is full 
of vitality and is extraordinarily active; however, the other 
side of the coin is the complex situation created by the 
entanglement, collision, and friction among various kinds of 
contradictions. True, those contradictions take place under the 
prerequisite of the identification of the people's basic 
interests, but, if they are not handled properly, negative 
consequences will surface and will give rise to problems which 
will be serious enough to affect the overall situation. This 
precisely requires our leading organs and leading cadres to be 
aware of the times and size up the situation, to be sober and 
good at properly handling the relations between reform, 
development and stability, to firmly take the initiative in 
their own hands in work, to convert negative to positive 
factors, and to give play to mass enthusiasm for reform and 
construction initiatives. 
<H8>  I. </H8>
  Today we can see a great difference in the expressive forms 
and characteristics of the contradictions among the people. It 
is very necessary for us to have a clear picture of the 
background to today's situation and the historical conditions 
that have given rise to those contradictions in order to adopt 
the correct policies and strategies to appropriately arrange 
work. This can be generalized in the following aspects. 
  First, the various reform measures we are presenting today 
are primarily based on the goal of reform, which is to build the 
socialist market economic structure while continuously 
readjusting the interest pattern and relations in various areas, 
thus meeting the requirements for the development of the 
productive forces. When the old balance is tipped, it will 
inevitably result in a series of contradictions. For example, 
the interest relations between the central government and 
localities, between the local government and enterprises, 
between the enterprise and its workers and staffers will all 
undergo new changes. Generally, these changes will make the 
interest relations in all aspects tend to be more rational; 
however, every aspect has its own specific interests and hopes 
that it will gain benefits but not suffer losses in the 
readjustment of the interest pattern. That being the case, 
various contradictions at every tier will markedly increase. At 
the same time, there is the contradiction between nurturing a 
socialist unified market and the separatism of departments and 
localities, the contradiction between legitimate and 
illegitimate operations, and the contradiction between proper 
and improper competition. Under the highly centralized planned 
economic structure of the past, such conditions were not so 
obvious, but they have become increasingly conspicuous with 
every passing day in the course of converting to the market 
economy. 
  Second, we have been pushing forward economic restructuring 
amid the high-speed operation of the national economy and have 
been maintaining rapid economic growth in the course of 
accelerating structural conversion. This being the case, the 
entire economic environment has been relatively tense. There 
are several contradictions in this area: between accelerating 
the growth rate and improving both the economic structure and 
economic returns; the imbalance between the eastern coastal 
areas and the middle and western areas in regional economic 
development; between the people's expectations in their longing 
to improve their living standards as quickly as possible and the 
limited material and financial strength; and the expansion in 
the scale of production and increased consumer spending, which 
will again result in a shortage of capital and skyrocketing 
prices. In addition, the differences in distribution and income 
between different regions and between employers of different 
economic forms, the imbalance between those having a relatively 
easy time and those taking up arduous tasks in their work, and 
the widening gap between prosperity and impoverishment have all 
surfaced. And, 
  Third, China has also gone through profound changes in its 
superstructure and ideology as the country opens up wider to the 
outside world with every passing day. During the transitional 
period when the old structure is being converted to the new, 
both practical work and ideology have taken on extraordinary 
complexity and activity. For example, we will find 
contradictions between the issue of how to guide the market 
mechanism into distribution and distribution according to work 
as well as common prosperity, the contradiction between the 
issue of how to handle the price system and existing wage and 
consumption policies, and the contradiction between 
money-worship and egoism and collectivism and between hedonism 
and corruption and the tradition of struggling hard amid 
difficulties. A solution to all these contradictions cannot be 
found overnight; consequently, some knotty problems and mistakes 
in work will often appear. Many units and departments are 
facing these kinds of problems, which will eventually be 
reflected in every individual's personal interest; this being 
the case, it is liable to result in fluctuations and a loss of 
balance to some extent in the people's thinking, psychology, and 
emotions. 
  There is no need to be evasive about the fact that a huge 
amount of various contradictions exist among the people today. 
Each pair of contradictions, however, contain the restriction of 
various complicated factors, which affect one another as they 
interact. The state's reform policy, the masses' practical 
interests, the people's thinking and concepts, and the effects 
of the social environment are more often than not interwoven. 
This being the case, there is a certain degree of difficulty in 
their solution. Our attitude is as follows: First, we must 
recognize that this is an inevitable phenomena in the course of 
social progress and development; some are old problems, but 
there are new contradictions as well. Our reform serves 
precisely to gradually resolve or ease these contradictions and 
iron out these kinds of problems in relations. Second, we must, 
at the same time, be brave in facing the difficulty and 
complexity of the cause of reform, adopt the correct policies 
and strategies to appropriately handle all kinds of 
contradictions and maintain the vitality of reform, while taking 
the opportunity to guide reform in depth. 
<H8>  II. </H8>
  To seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, 
promote development, and maintain stability is the overall 
direction for the work of the whole party and the whole country 
this year. In handling the contradictions among the people in 
the new situation, it is necessary to proceed from, be subject 
to, and serve this overall direction. Based on this 
understanding, in handling the contradictions among the people 
in the new situation, we should do a good job of grasping the 
following points: 
  First, our starting point is to resolve contradictions, iron 
out differences, promote understanding, and give play to 
positive factors. Most of the various kinds of contradictions 
among the people which exist today fall into the category of 
interest relations or issues of ideological understanding and 
concepts; generally, they do not have a confrontational quality. 
Our principle is to do more work in reconciliation, 
coordination, and mediation. When faced with contradictions and 
disputes, the leading organs and leading cadres should be good 
at eliminating misunderstandings, removing hurdles to find 
channels for solutions, building bridges for mutual 
communication, and balancing the interest relations between all 
parties involved. Practice has pointed to the fact that 
understanding and communication are very important and represent 
an effective way to resolve contradictions. If all sides 
involved are able to seek common ground while reserving 
differences and understand and make concessions to each other -- 
all the while taking the overall situation into account -- many 
contradictions, including some very knotty ones, can find 
relatively appropriate solutions peacefully. The key lies in 
showing sincerity, adopting a constructive attitude, and taking 
practical measures. 
  Second, our basic train of thought is that those problems 
that surface in the course of reform should be resolved by 
deepening reform and those problems that surface in the course 
of development should be resolved in the same manner. Take, for 
example, the issue of employment -- it is by no means a simple 
issue of making arrangements. If we fail to open up more 
channels for employment, do not adopt various forms of 
employment, and continue to rely on the government to take care 
of everything, a solution will be very difficult to find. To 
use another example, some enterprises are suffering from 
deficits due to poor management, overstocking of products, and 
attempts to sell poor-quality products at high prices. Simple 
protective measures cannot provide a radical solution; only by 
pushing the enterprise toward the market to participate in 
competition will the problems be solved. From a long-term point 
of view, development is the last word [fa zhan si ying dao li 
4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810]; when the national economy 
develops, there will be far greater leeway for resolving all 
kinds of contradictions and problems. As social material and 
spiritual wealth increases, the nation becomes prosperous and 
strong, and the people become well off, many contradictions will 
be easily resolved. If the economy fails to develop, everything 
else will be out of the question. 
  Third, resolving contradictions by means of democracy and 
the legal system constitute an important principle which we must 
follow. The masses of the people are the main force of reform. 
Without the support and cooperation of the majority of the 
masses, we will accomplish nothing in our work. Hence, it is 
necessary to develop democracy and consult the masses on all 
major issues. Before a major policy is introduced, it is 
necessary to listen to opinions from various quarters and choose 
and follow what is good. After a policy is announced, it is 
necessary to organize the broad ranks of the cadres and the 
masses to earnestly implement it. At the same time, we should 
solicit the views of the masses and constantly revise, 
compliment, and improve the policy. Centering on the 
requirements of establishing a socialist market economic system, 
we have formulated a series of laws, regulations, and systems. 
This is the foundation for settling all kinds of contradictions 
and problems. No unit or individual may override the law, 
regulations, and system and do as it or he likes. The style of 
"seriously resolving the major issues while paying little 
attention to minor ones" must be discouraged. Whatever reason 
one has, the contradictions and problems can only be resolved 
within the framework of state law, regulations, and systems. 
Practice has proven that complying with the law and regulations 
is the effective way to eliminate unreasonable quibbling and 
remove artificial interference. 
<H8>  III. </H8>
  Leading organs at all levels, particularly the leading 
cadres, shoulder great responsibility for properly handling the 
contradictions among the people in the new situation. New 
contradictions and problems will emerge in large numbers at a 
time when we are making strenuous efforts to push reform 
forward. We must work conscientiously, seriously, and earnestly 
and pay special attention to the following: 
  Make great efforts to strengthen ideological and political 
work. During the transition, in which the old system will be 
replaced by a new one, the thinking of the masses will be 
exceptionally active due to changes in the social structure and 
interests setup. The expression of differing views and thinking 
is quite natural. If we neglect ideological education and lack 
correct guidance, a trifling matter can easily lead to an 
incident. Hence, ideological work should be more meticulous 
alongside deepening reform. It is necessary to conduct 
ideological education work in connection with reality rather 
than evade contradictions and put on bureaucratic airs. We 
should resolve practical problems one by one, explain the 
policies as well as the difficulties to the masses, and keep 
from covering up problems and contradictions. This is one of 
the methods for dispelling misunderstanding and increasing 
common understanding. For example, the policies on grain 
delivery, tax imposition, retention of profits, residential 
land, land requisition, and resource exploitation should be 
clearly explained. The masses should understand the duties they 
must undertake as well as the rights they can exercise. In the 
distribution of income, it is necessary to explain the 
difference between income gaps and unfair distribution and 
clarify which ways of becoming rich are reasonable and which are 
not. It is particularly necessary to tell them that we are 
against those who make exorbitant profits. We should take 
special note of conducting education among the masses with the 
idea of reform so that they can understand that short-term 
individual and immediate interests should be subordinate to the 
long-term interests of the state and society as a whole. When 
the facts are presented and the truth is explained, the majority 
of the masses will certainly take the overall situation into 
account. 
  Fighting corruption, running a clean administration, and 
getting rid of bureaucracy constitute an important way to 
mitigate all kinds of contradictions. The masses of some 
localities hate corruption and bureaucracy more than anything 
else. Corruption is primarily manifested by some cadres making 
a profit through abusing their special position to engage in 
economic activities. Although this involves only a handful of 
people, it has had a negative influence among the masses. The 
disputes in interests in a number of localities have been 
complicated precisely due to this factor, and some have even 
become antagonistic. A bureaucratic work style is also an 
essential reason why contradictions come about and are 
aggravated. Some contradictions and disputes, though not 
serious, may lead to drastic mass reactions if they are left 
unattended for a long period of time. We should encourage the 
spirit of earnestly undertaking responsibility and opposing the 
practices of shifting responsibility onto others and glossing 
over mistakes. If the opinions and requirements of the masses 
are reasonable, they should be met immediately where conditions 
permit. Regarding reasonable opinions and requirements which 
cannot be resolved for the time being for various reasons, it 
necessary to do persuasive work and create the conditions for 
resolving them. As regards the requirements which are not very 
reasonable, as long as they are not deliberately provocative, we 
should explain principles, introduce policies, and give the 
masses a clear answer. In a word, we must go deep into the 
realities of life among the masses. Leading cadres should do 
work in those places where there are contradictions and problems. 
  We should be concerned about the well-being of the masses 
and help them resolve their difficulties. For various reasons, 
the income of some workers in loss-making enterprises has 
dropped and they have had difficulties securing their 
livelihood; the interests of some peasants have also dropped, 
and they have had to deal with a number of problems in 
production and livelihood. This is related to the stability of 
the overall situation. The enthusiasm of some localities for 
construction is now running high, but, due to the shortage of 
capital, they often neglect the basic livelihood of the masses. 
This merits attention. We would rather cut a number of 
projects and curtail other expenditures and use the money that 
is saved to ensure that the "rice bags" and "vegetable baskets" 
of the masses are full. It is particularly necessary to show 
concern for the workers in some loss-making enterprises who have 
financial difficulties, provide timely help, and make proper 
arrangements for their livelihood. We should always bear in 
mind the problems related to the livelihood of the masses -- 
such as social order, water and electric supply, and schooling 
-- and must be eager to meet their needs. In this way, our 
social life will be filled with tranquility and harmony. There 
will be fewer contradictions and friction, and those that appear 
will be easily resolved. 
  In the new situation, the contradictions among the people 
will be extremely complicated. These contradictions should be 
resolved through persuasion, education, mediation, and 
consultation. We must absolutely avoid being rigid, rough, and 
brutal [sheng ying cu bao 3932 4289 4723 2552]. However, it is 
also necessary to take note of the change in the nature of the 
contradictions. When tackling the phenomenon of complicated 
contradictions, we should make an accurate judgment of their 
nature and adopt timely measures. We should strive to gain an 
initiative in all our work and try to nip all problems in the 
bud. 
  The handling of contradictions among the people covers much 
ground. Therefore, we should mobilize the forces of all fields 
and encourage everybody to do work. Party committees and 
governments at all levels must properly perform organization and 
coordination work; the democratic parties at all levels and mass 
organizations should vigorously offer cooperation; and all 
localities, departments, and units should get involved. To 
handle the contradictions among the people in the new situation, 
we must have correct guidelines and work methods, and this 
requires a powerful organizational guarantee.

<F P=106> [By Ling Yun (0407 0061): "The Inside Story of the </F>
Explosion of the `Fengyun-2' Satellite"] 
  [Text] The Senior Central Hierarchy Shocked by 46 
Casualties 
  On the afternoon of 7 April, the State Council General 
Office 
issued a circular on the first geostationary 
satellite--Fengyun-2--scheduled to be launched by Long March-3 
carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in the 
middle of April. According to the circular, since an accident 
had occurred in the course of technological testing and the 
satellite and the workshop had been damaged, the launch plan 
would be rescheduled. 
  The circular did not disclose details of the accident or 
whether or not there were casualties, but viewed from the 
wording, that is, the "satellite and the workshop were damaged," 
the accident was quite serious. As the workshop at the Xichang 
Satellite Launch Center for installing satellites is very big 
and its ceiling is very high, it would be very difficult for an 
ordinary and light explosion to damage the workshop. Moreover, 
people feel that this accident was very unusual because the 
Chinese authorities concerned did not mention the timing for the 
rescheduled launch. 
  This was how things were. The news that this writer got from 
the State Council Science and Technology Commission and the 
State Science and Technology Commission [as published] was very 
astonishing: The Fengyun-2 exploded during a satellite test and 
caused a fire at 1010 on 27 March. It was learned that the 
accident had caused heavy casualties, that is, 46 scientists and 
functionaries were either injured or dead, and some of the 
injured were sent to Beijing by special plane for treatment. 
Among the dead was a CPC senior satellite expert and deputy 
chief engineer of the Xichang Satellite Headquarters surnamed 
Su, who headed the leading group for launching the Fengyun-2 
geostationary meteorological satellite as well as the satellite 
test. 
  The CPC's senior hierarchy was immediately called into 
action 
following the satellite explosion. Ding Henggao, Song Jian, and 
Luo Gan rushed to the scene by special plane that very night. 
On 29 March, Zou Jiahua and Zhang Wannian also went to Xichang 
to carry out an inspection on behalf of the CPC Central 
Committee and the CPC Central Military Commission. The 
explosion was so strong that equipment worth 600 million yuan 
was destroyed in an instant and the launch center could not 
function. After discussions, in early April, the State Council 
appropriated 350 million yuan in emergency funds for the Xichang 
Satellite Center for reconstruction. As the site had been 
severely burned, it is still uncertain when the center will be 
able to launch satellites again. 
<H5>  Different Versions of the Cause of the Accident </H5>
  Different versions of this extraordinarily large satellite 
accident spread. A relatively "orthodox" version said that the 
test on that day was the final assessment test and that leaders 
and experts concerned went there to carry out an inspection. 
When the test had just began, a power source short-circuited, 
causing sparks. The head of the test immediately ordered that 
the operation be stopped and that all personnel retreat to the 
safety room. But when the order had just been issued, the 
satellite exploded and started burning. Fire fighters standing 
by on the spot instantly threw themselves into the rescue 
operation and put out the fire two hours later and brought the 
injured out of danger. 
  In another version, the accident was even described as 
intentional sabotage. It was alleged that the Satellite Launch 
Headquarters and the chief satellite installation engineer had 
carried out an assessment and considered everything to be ready 
before allowing the test to be conducted on schedule. However, 
three power sources short-circuited simultaneously, which was 
unimaginable. That day, the person who should have been on duty 
at the power supply department had suddenly been replaced by 
somebody else. Following the accident, the person in charge of 
the power supply room who was on duty shot himself. Some people 
said that he committed suicide because he felt frustrated, while 
others said that he did so to escape punishment. 
<H5>  Ding Henggao, Song Jian's Instructions </H5>
  Other versions tended to ascribe the cause of the accident 
to 
negligence and carelessness. It was alleged that at the time of 
the test, a certain part of the satellite made an unusual sound 
soon after it started operating and the person in charge ordered 
a halt to the operation for an examination, but the operator 
mistook this for accelerating the speed, and consequently the 
satellite exploded. 
  Some people said that the head and the chief engineer had 
suggested that the test be conducted after obtaining one or two 
additional verifications and making further checks, but the 
leaders concerned held that since time was pressing, they could 
secure proofs while conducting the test. Consequently, the 
accident occurred. 
  Other people said that something wrong had been found at the 
testing ground, but that the authorities did not watch out for 
it and still ordered that the test be conducted on schedule. 
Consequently, the satellite exploded less than three minutes 
after it started operating. 
  Apart from the above-mentioned versions, the accident was 
also analyzed in the following way: Recently, many accidents 
have occurred in the process of launching and producing 
satellites, and this is related to the fact that scientists and 
technicians are emotionally unstable because their pay is too 
low and they have worked in a remote environment for a long 
time. In addition, major accidents have occurred because the 
system is so slack. 
  The cause of the accident is still under investigation, but 
the versions spread and remarks made by Ding Henggao and Song 
Jian after their inspection deserve to be pondered. At that 
time, Ding and Song said in unison that the key to the problem 
still lay in rigorous enforcement of rules and regulations and a 
strict scientific attitude and in paying close attention to the 
requests and feelings of scientists and technicians. 
<H5>  Deplorable Remuneration of Personnel of the Astronautics </H5>
Sector 
  Xichang, called Gongdu in ancient times, is situated in the 
southwestern part of Sichuan Province, a zone of Central Asian 
tropical plateau monsoon weather hemmed in by mountains with an 
elevation of 1,590 meters, and it is painstakingly portrayed by 
the official media as the "beautiful and fascinating moon city." 
But in reality, the water quality of the mountain valley in 
which the Xichang Satellite Launch Center is located is poor. 
People are particularly fond of eating meat after drinking the 
water, but they feel bloated after eating. [sentence as 
published] Some people call it the "Xichang disease." Also, it 
is common to have the reactions to high-plateau weather, such as 
diarrhea, headaches, and fever. Intellectuals of the Xichang 
Satellite Launch Center are even more distressed spiritually. 
There is no fashion or pop music, but only the popular saying: 
"Devoting one's youth, life, and offspring to the cause." 
Vigorously played up by the CPC media, this jingle has become 
the portrayal of scientists' and technicians' unselfishness. 
The satellite town in Xichang is different from the nuclear 
test base. The two are located in equally remote areas, but the 
former officially started opening up to the outside world from 1 
September 1988 and has been visited by people from over 50 
countries and regions and, owing to the atmosphere of liberation 
outside, the CPC's grand but empty and unreal propaganda of 
"devoting oneself to the cause" can no longer be effective. In 
particular, they know that in order to have a share in the 
highly competitive global satellite-launching market, China has 
to win launch contracts at a low price. For example, the price 
for launching two satellites with a U.S. Titan-3 rocket is from 
$100 million to $125 million; the General Dynamics Corporation's 
price is from $40 million to $90 million; and the McDonnell 
Douglas Corporation's price for launching a medium-sized 
commercial communications satellite is from $45 million to $50 
million. In order to compete with the "three U.S. moguls," 
China sets the satellite-launching price at $25 million only. 
Such a "bargain price" is really effective and has lured 
representatives of over 20 countries and regions to Xichang to 
hold talks on cooperation. 
  The monthly pay of an intellectual of the Chinese 
astronautics sector is a mere several hundred yuan, and the 
saying that "one who deals with missiles is even inferior to 
those selling tea" is the best portrayal of their situation. 
The meager pay of satellite installation workers, who bear a 
great responsibility, is really astonishing. In the Xichang 
Satellite General Installation Plant, workers at grade 2 are 
paid only around 50 yuan, and those at grade 8 are paid 100 yuan 
for a long time without any increment. Workers worked hard 
round the clock for over a year to produce the Long March 2 
cluster carrier rocket, and each of them was paid merely a 
little more than 200 yuan bonus, with the monthly average less 
than 20 yuan. It was learned that those installing satellites 
in Xichang are experienced workers with unique skills. They 
thought that once commercial rockets were launched, their living 
conditions would be improved, but, to their disappointment, it 
was only their own wishful thinking! 
  There were generally grievances in the hearts of most 
scientists and technicians. At the launch center monitoring 
station, some young college students could no longer bear the 
lifestyle of "seeing soldiers in the daytime and counting stars 
at night." Some of them cried secretly, some asked for 
transfers, and others simply sneaked away. However, the 
authorities concerned did not pay attention to their growing 
feelings of insecurity, and were stunned only by the explosion 
of the Fengyun-2 satellite. 
<H5>  More and More Serious Satellite Accidents </H5>
  Over the past four years, four satellite accidents have 
occurred in China, each more serious than the last, which will 
certainly affect China's "commercial credit" in the global 
satellite-launching market. Apart from the one reported in this 
article, the other three accidents were as follows: 
  On 22 March 1992, due to a breakdown in the ignition system, 
the launch of Australia's Aussat-B1 communications satellite at 
the Xichang base failed. 
  On 21 December 1992, Australia's Optus-B2 communications 
satellite exploded 48 seconds after being launched into orbit 
from the Xichang base. 
  On 16 October 1993, China's recoverable satellite for 
scientific exploration and technological experimentation broke 
down and could not be recovered eight days after being launched 
into orbit. The United States said it had fallen into the 
Pacific, but China said it was still wandering through space. 
  In addition, China's "commercial image" is also called into 
question by many overseas clients. For example, when the 
satellite accidentally exploded on 21 December 1992, the 
personnel of the Xichang Center still opened bottles of 
champagne to celebrate the launch and the scene was really 
bustling. In fact, the satellite exploded less than a minute 
after being launched into orbit. However, China "only cared 
about the launch," whereas the explosion was caused by the 
satellite's internal problems, so the case should be handled by 
the client! 
  Moreover, last year's grand launch of the satellite for 
scientific and technological experimentation was even a farce. 
A Mao Zedong gold badge numbered "8341," which was cast in 
18-karat gold and inlaid with 44 South African diamonds (some 
people revealed that the diamonds were fake), was put inside the 
satellite and the company concerned had the unique idea of 
selling the badge by auction after it had "travelled through the 
universe" because they thought that by so doing, the badge would 
certainly be sold at a much higher price. It allegedly cost 
80,000 yuan to send the Mao Zedong badge into space by satellite 
and a 100,000-yuan insurance premium was also paid; but a Hong 
Kong company had offered to buy it for 2 million yuan, therefore 
over 1 million yuan net profit would be reaped in this deal. 
However, all these calculations were not realized. China has 
successfully retrieved 14 recoverable satellites, but it was 
such a coincidence that the satellite with the Mao Zedong badge 
met with an accident and became a heap of garbage in space....

  [Text] Beijing, 24 May (XINHUA) -- According to the China 
Satellite Launch Tracking and Control Department: The accident 
of the meteorological satellite, the "Fengyun II," will not 
affect China's plan of launching satellites for foreign 
countries. Chinese authorities, after consulting with the 
Hughes Aircraft Corporation of the United States, have decided 
to proceed with the original plans of launching the three 
foreign satellites -- the "Asiasat I," the "Asiasat II," and the 
"Optus B3" -- during the second half of the year.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 May (XINHUA) -- The CPC Central 
Committee General Office recently issued a circular asking all 
localities to organize the vast number of cadres into studying 
modern scientific and technological knowledge. The following is 
the full text of the circular: 
  The world's current high and new technology development 
keeps 
on changing and international competition in science and 
technology is intensifying. If we do not take firm measures to 
equip our party members and cadres with modern scientific and 
technological knowledge as well as upgrade the level of the 
entire Chinese people in scientific education, it is impossible 
to gain the initiative in international competition. Therefore, 
the party Central Committee has decided that while earnestly 
studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics as well as the socialist market 
economic theory and fundamental knowledge, all party comrades 
must earnestly study modern scientific and technological 
knowledge. 
  In studying modern scientific and technological knowledge, 
it 
is necessary to study the Marxist fundamental viewpoint on 
science and technology. In particular, it is necessary to study 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important expositions, firmly establish 
the concept of "science and technology is the primary productive 
force," and more conscientiously implement the principle of 
"economic construction cannot do without science and technology, 
and scientific and technological work must be geared to economic 
construction." It is necessary to realistically shift economic 
construction and social development onto the path of relying on 
scientific and technological progress and upgrading workers' 
quality. It is necessary to become more familiar with the 
fundamental knowledge of modern science and technology, 
understand current the revolutionary trend in the world's new 
technology, comprehend the general pattern of scientific and 
technological progress, and upgrade cadres' quality in 
scientific education as a whole. We must conscientiously apply 
scientific and technological theory, knowledge, and methods to 
observe and handle problems, as well as continue to 
scientifically upgrade our policy-making capability and work 
level. "Fundamental Knowledge in Modern Science and 
Technology," a book proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin and compiled 
under the leadership of the State Science Commission, discusses 
in a simple and profound manner new knowledge and progress in 
the world's scientific and technological development, as well as 
our countermeasures. It can be used as a rudimentary textbook 
for cadres to study modern scientific and technological 
knowledge. 
  Party committees at all levels must outline specific plans 
for cadres to study modern scientific and technological 
knowledge, and conduct regular supervision and inspection. 
Leading cadres must take an exemplary lead by studying the 
subject well. Party schools at all levels and cadre training 
institutions of various categories must incorporate the teaching 
of modern scientific and technological knowledge into cadres' 
training plans. They should closely cooperate with science 
commissions and science associations at all levels as well as 
local scientific research institutes and institutes of higher 
learning to effectively plan for teaching courses and to select 
the teaching force. While concentrating on self-study, working 
cadres should avail themselves of flexible, varied, and 
effective study and guidance. Press and propaganda departments 
should coordinate closely with cadres' study by increasing their 
publicity of science and technology as well as vigorously 
popularizing modern scientific and technological knowledge.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- China plans to build an 
international biotechnology development center in Zhejiang 
Province, East China, to boost the industrialization and scale 
of China's biotechnological development. 
  Situated between the banks of Xihu, or West Lake, in 
Hangzhou 
Bay, and Qiantang River, the center will be constructed by 
Beijing Globe Biotechnology Development Center affiliated with 
the Chinese Academy of Sciences. 
  After approving the site selection proposal today, experts 
said that biotechnology is the most vigorous and has the most 
potential among studies in high-tech development. The new 
industries related to biotechnology are new sectors which are 
experiencing the most rapid development and are reaping the best 
economic results. 
  The new biotechnology development center will dedicate 
itself 
to the development of new biotechnology products by closely 
watching the world's latest developments in biotechnology 
research, the experts said.

  [Text] On 14 May, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier 
of the State Council, listened to an economic work report by the 
Hubei Provincial CPC Committee and government in Wuhan. 
Attendees at the meeting included responsible persons from 16 
ministries, commissions, and financial organs under the State 
Council who accompanied Vice Premier Zhu Rongji to Wuhan, as 
well as Hubei Governor Jia Zhijie; Hui Liangyu, provincial party 
deputy secretary and chairman of the provincial Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference; Qian Yunlu, provincial party 
deputy secretary and Wuhan City CPC Secretary; and others. 
  In his work report, provincial Governor Jia Zhijie said: 
Since this year, our province's national economy has maintained 
a better momentum of development. As far as agriculture is 
concerned, a good summer harvest is expected. Our rural work 
has been centered on the targets of stabilizing grain and cotton 
production and vigorously developing a diversified economy and 
township and town enterprises. We are doing a solid job in this 
regard. Industry has had a good start. From January to April 
this year, industrial production output value at and above 
township level reached 50.284 billion yuan, an increase of 18.6 
percent over the same period last year. In the meantime, we have 
increased the weight of opening up to the outside world. 
Macroscopic management structural reform mainly targeted at 
finance, tax, banking, investments, foreign trade, and planning 
has been progressing smoothly. Jia Zhijie also talked about 
difficult points in present economic work and striking 
contradictions and ways and ideas to deal with them. 
  After listening to the work report, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji 
said: The situation of economic construction and reform and 
opening up in Hubei Province is good. This is the outcome of 
hard work done by Hubei's leaders at all levels and the broad 
masses of people in accordance with the 20-character guiding 
principle worked out by the central authorities. He hoped that 
Hubei Province would continue to firmly and unswervingly 
implement the guiding principle of seizing the favorable 
opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening up, speeding up 
development, and maintaining stability to correctly handle 
relations between reform, development, and stability and 
maintain and develop the present favorable situation. 
  Zhu Rongji pointed out: Hubei is a large agricultural 
province. When Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong and Guangxi have a bumper 
crop, the country is free from hunger. Hubei must do well its 
rural work to speed up its agricultural development. Leaders at 
all levels must make efforts to grasp agriculture, grain 
production, and the vegetable basket project. Zhu Rongji 
stressed: Changes in price indexes in daily life of urban and 
rural residents are, to a large extent, affected by grain and 
other agricultural products. Only by grasping well agriculture 
can the government stabilize the market and gain the initiative 
to regulate and control the market. 
  As far as industrial production is concerned, Zhu Rongji 
emphasized: Under the guidance of the market, we must carry out 
effective production. We must stop any action which leads to 
the overstocking of goods because of blindly seeking speed. He 
said: We must shift our attention to studying the market and 
guide and help those enterprises which have suspended production 
or have been operating under capacity to gradually turn the 
corner. From 16 to 17 May, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji also 
respectively visited rural areas in Hanchuan County and the 
provincial People's Bank and Agricultural Bank to discuss with 
cadres and masses at the grass-roots level major plans for 
speeding up agricultural development and strengthening financial 
management. He encouraged them to make still greater work 
achievements.

<F P=106> [By reporter Su Huizhi (5685 2585 1807)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 19 May (XINHUA) -- During a recent study 
and investigative tour of Beijing's suburbs, Wen Jiabao, 
alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the 
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, emphasized: Suburban 
areas, which play an important role in guaranteeing the supply 
of farm products to the city, should serve city residents and 
help rural farmers prosper by continuing to reinforce 
agriculture to ensure the success of the "vegetable basket" 
project; they should strive to explore a new way for developing 
the suburban economy, bring into play the suburbs' advantages, 
develop the economy in an all-round way, and raise farmers' 
incomes. 
  From 16 to 19 May, Wen Jiabao conducted the investigative 
tour in Pinggu, Shunyi, and Tongxian counties. He visited farm 
households, fields, and pig and cattle farms, earnestly 
familiarizing himself with grain production and the vegetable 
basket project, asking questions about rural economic 
development and farmers' everyday life, and discussing with them 
a number of problems in agricultural production. 
  Fully affirming Beijing municipality's achievements in 
agriculture and rural work, Wen Jiabao said: Suburban areas are 
the primary bases which supply nonstaple foods to the city. To 
do a good job in agricultural production in the suburbs to 
ensure plentiful and stable supply of nonstaple foods is of 
crucial importance to guaranteeing the city's economic 
development and social stability. Leaders at all levels must 
attach strategic importance to agricultural development in 
suburban areas. We should increase the input into agriculture 
and raise its comprehensive production capacity by supplementing 
and building up agriculture with industrial production. We 
should rely on science and technology to enable agriculture to 
develop toward a pattern of high yields, high quality, and high 
efficiency and to raise the comparative efficiency of 
agricultural production. In line with the demand for scientific 
farming and socialized production, we should develop, where 
conditions permit, operations adaptable to scaled economy so as 
to raise the agricultural labor productivity and land output 
rate. He pointed out: The suburbs -- with their convenient 
transportation, accessibility to information, and large markets 
-- should support the city and raise farmers' incomes by 
developing the rural economy in an all-round way and raising the 
comprehensive efficiency of rural economy. They should pay 
close attention to the comprehensive development of agriculture, 
energetically exploit non-farmland resources such as barren 
hilly areas and uncultivated beaches, and develop agriculture, 
forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, and sideline production in 
an all-round way. They should readjust the structure of rural 
economy to keep abreast of market demands; and should never 
relax efforts at grain production while actively developing 
diversified operations, expanding village and township 
enterprises and tertiary industries, and developing products 
with high added value. They should expedite the flow of surplus 
rural laborers by guiding village and township enterprises to 
concentrate at appropriate places and combine them with the 
construction of small rural towns. Wen Jiabao said: Beijing, 
China's capital, is a major city. The development of 
agriculture and rural economy in Beijing's suburbs can set the 
pace for suburban areas throughout the country. Cadres and 
people at large in the suburbs must persist in emancipating the 
minds, seeking truth from facts, and striving to explore a new 
way for developing agriculture and rural economy in the suburbs 
of China's large and medium cities. 
  Since mid-April, timely rains have fallen in Beijing, 
alleviating the drought situation and helping the growth of 
summer crops. While inspecting wheat fields, Wen Jiabao 
emphasized that as the summer crops have entered the production 
stage, it is necessary to pay close attention to pest prevention 
and control, to guard against drought and waterlogging, and 
ensure a good job in other tasks of field management. 
Governments at all levels should step up guidance, provide 
adequate services, and strive to reap an even better harvest. 
  Vice agriculture minister Wang Baorui, and Yang Chaoshi, 
Standing Committee member and director of the Organization 
Department of the Beijing municipal party committee, also 
participated in the investigative tour.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam and Zhang Yuan] </F>
  [Text] Beijing has given planning-oriented bureaucrats 
more power in working out ways to achieve the contradictory 
goals of curbing inflation and propping up the money-losing 
state enterprises. 
  Informed sources said the State Planning Commission (SPC) 
had 
been empowered to take over the research and planning functions 
of up to eight ministries and commissions. 
  They said the bulk of the research units of these 
departments 
had been dissolved and taken over by an enlarged research centre 
in the SPC, which has an establishment of more than 700 
academics and officials. 
  "The SPC Research Centre will have formidable authority and 
resources in making long-range forecasts and recommending the 
`macrolevel' controls the state must exercise," an economic 
source said. 
  The source added that recent problems in the economy had 
prompted the leadership to give more emphasis to both direct and 
nonmandatory state control. 
  It is understood the leadership hopes that with strengthened 
research and forecasts, executive orders will be free from the 
kinds of mistakes underlying such disasters as the Great Leap 
Forward. 
  Liberal cadres and academics have criticised the apparent 
increase in the power of the SPC, deemed a creation of Stalinist 
state planning. 
  Analysts said in 1992 and last year, the authorities 
seriously considered scrapping the SPC and replacing it with a 
much less powerful State Commission for Social and Economic 
Development. 
  However, given the need for Beijing to walk the high wire of 
containing inflation and cutting unemployment, the planners are 
again required to provide recommendations for comprehensive 
government intervention. 
  In a recent speech, the senior economist with the State 
Statistical Bureau, Qiu Xiaohua, underscored the importance of 
striking a balance between conflicting goals. 
  "If we are too anxious about reducing inflation to within 10 
percent and continuing a tight policy, the market will become 
flaccid, state enterprises will face more difficulties and the 
contradictions in employment will become more acute," Mr Qiu 
said.

"Vast Vistas, Bright Prospects--Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, Extensively Talks About the 
Development of Foreign-Funded Enterprises"] 
  [Text] Editor's note: Foreign-funded enterprises in 
China, which were tender seedlings in the 1980's and which have 
attracted extensive domestic and foreign attention, are now 
standing before the world with a brand new outlook. Their 
industrial output value now accounts for over one-tenth of the 
country's total, and their imports and exports account for 
one-third. Foreign investment absorbed by these enterprises 
accounts for nine-tenths of the country's use of foreign 
capital. Large and efficient enterprises with a high technology 
content and with the ability to earn more foreign exchange have 
emerged one after another. The vigorous development of 
foreign-funded enterprises has played an increasingly important 
role in China's economic construction, demonstrating the 
outstanding achievements of reform and opening up. After 
leaving Beijing on 28 April, the team charged with covering 
"China's noted foreign-funded enterprises" went to all 
localities and wrote a number of articles reflecting the growth, 
successful experience, and outstanding contributions of the 
foreign-funded enterprises. Commencing today, we will publish 
these articles one after another to provide our readers with a 
window to understand contemporary China's reform, opening up, 
and modernization program. [end editor's note] 
  Since reform and opening up, China has achieved marked 
successes in the use of foreign capital. Foreign-funded 
enterprises have become an important force in China's national 
economic development, and a number of noted, efficient, and 
properly managed ones have particularly attracted attention at 
home and abroad. As China's reform and opening up has entered a 
new stage of development, foreign-funded enterprises, which are 
marked symbols of opening up, have also greeted a new high tide. 
Under such a momentum, how should we maintain the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy growth of the foreign-funded enterprises? We 
held an interview with Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation and asked her to express her views. 
  "I am optimistic about the development of foreign-funded 
enterprises." Minister Wu Yi gave a spirited account of the 
status quo of foreign-funded enterprises: 
  "Vigorously making effective use of foreign capital 
constitutes an important element of China's open policy and 
economic work. Absorbing direct foreign investment is one of the 
main forms of making use of foreign capital. By March this 
year, the country approved a total of 186,000 foreign-invested 
projects, with agreed-upon capital of $241.5 and an actual 
investment of $67.2 billion. Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
tour of southern China in early 1992, the enthusiasm of foreign 
businessmen for investing in China ran high, and both the number 
of projects and the amount of capital doubled. In 1993, the 
country approved 83,000 foreign-funded projects, involving 
contracted capital of $111.4 billion and an actual use of $27.5 
billion, an increase of 71.1 percent, 91.72 percent, and 149.95 
percent respectively over 1992, or equivalent to the total sum 
of the 14 years since reform and opening up. According to 
figures provided by a foreign authoritative accounting office, 
the United States, China, and Britain have become the major 
countries for international commercial investment in 1993. 
China's position, which was sixth in 1992, rose to second in 
1993, second only to the United States. The foreign capital 
absorbed by China in 1993 accounted for one-tenth of the world's 
overseas capital of $152 billion. In the first three months of 
this year, China again approved 12,000 foreign-invested 
projects, with an agreed upon investment of $19.6 billion, or a 
real foreign investment of $5.4 billion." 
  The reporter asked, "What are the new characteristics of 
direct foreign investment absorbed by China over the past two 
years or so?" 
  "Over the past two years, the number of countries and 
regions 
investing in China has been continuously increasing, rising from 
a little more than 80 in 1991 to 133 by the end of 1993. The 
ten largest investors include: Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan, the 
United States, Japan, Singapore, Britain, Thailand, Canada, 
Germany, and Australia. 
  "The scope of investment has been expanded. The average 
amount of contracted foreign capital in each project was $1.33 
million in 1993, an increase of 12.9 percent over the $1.178 
million in 1992. The average figure in Guangdong, Fujian, 
Shanghai, and Beijing approached or exceeded $2 million. By the 
end of 1993, the number of projects involving an investment of 
over $10 million approved by China totaled more than 1,800. 
  "Apart from the expansion in the areas and field of 
investment, the means of investment also diversified. Although 
foreign investment in China primarily focuses on the coastal 
areas, the interior is also speeding up its pace of attracting 
foreign investment. In 1993, approximately 80 percent of the 
foreign-funded projects and the amount was focused on the 
coastal areas; however, the proportion of foreign-funded 
projects and capital attracted by the interior rose from 7 to 8 
percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Foreign businessmen made 
marked progress in their investment in the three major 
industries. The fields of banking, insurance, real estate, 
retail sales, consultation, accountant office, and information 
services were also opened gradually to foreign investors. New 
headway was made in the means of foreign investment. The 
establishment of more than 30 Sino-foreign shareholding 
enterprises was approved, and more than 20 special renminbi 
shares (B shares) were listed on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock 
exchanges. In recent years, we also selectively approved a 
number of investment companies." 
  "Moreover, a number of transnational companies have been 
active in their investment in China, which further optimized the 
investment setup. By the end of 1993, more than 80 
transnational industrial corporations from Europe, the United 
States, Japan, and the developed countries and regions in the 
Asia- Pacific region made investments in China. Some of the 
transnational corporations and big companies with solid 
financial foundations also ran a number of transportation, 
energy, infrastructure, raw material, and other large projects 
which were badly needed for national economic development. The 
large scale and amount involved in these high-level projects 
further rationalized and optimized the investment setup." 
  "Could you tell us the status and role of foreign investors 
in China's economic development?" 
  "With the expansion in the scope and field of investment 
made 
by foreign businessmen, foreign investment is playing an 
increasingly important role in China's economic development." 
  "Foreign investment has accelerated the pace of China's 
economic development and has increased employment opportunities 
and state revenue. The proportion of China's annual actual use 
of foreign investment to total investment in fixed assets, which 
was 2.5 percent in the 1980's, 8 percent in 1992, and 13 percent 
in 1993, constituted one of the essential sources of capital for 
China's economic construction. Foreign-funded enterprises which 
have gone into operation total over 80,000, of which the output 
value of industrial enterprises accounted for 7.5 percent of the 
country's total in 1992, 11 percent in 1993, and higher in 
Guangdong and Fujian. Taxes collected from foreign-funded 
enterprises increased for successive years, jumping from 10.7 
billion yuan in 1992 to 20.6 billion yuan in 1993, nearly 
doubling the figure. The number of people employed by 
foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation total 
approximately 10 million. 
  "Foreign investment promoted China's industrial progress. 
The available foreign capital is primarily used in importing 
advanced technology and equipment, which filled the gaps in some 
domestic technology, upgraded large number of products, narrowed 
the gap between China and advanced international levels, and 
brought about an upgrading of similar domestic products. 
Meanwhile, the transfer of parts and technology of many trades 
further boosted the growth of the relevant domestic industries 
and improved the production and technological level." 
  "Foreign-funded enterprises have become a vital force in 
China's foreign trade. The volume of imports and exports of 
foreign-funded enterprises in 1993 totaled $67.1 billion, 
accounting for 34.4 percent of the volume of the country's 
imports and exports, of which their exports amounted to $25.2 
billion, accounting for 27.5 percent of the country's total. 
China's foreign trade grew comprehensively in the first quarter 
of this year, with the volume of imports and exports reaching 
$39.5 billion, of which the volume of imports and exports of 
foreign-funded enterprises amounted to $14.66 billion, 
accounting for 37.1 percent of the country's total as compared 
with the 30 percent rise of the previous year. The development 
of foreign-funded enterprises improved the structure of China's 
export commodities and enormously boosted China's foreign trade." 
  "The means of organizations and operation of foreign-funded 
enterprises, their market mechanisms, and the scientific 
enterprise management system have offered a demonstration and 
reference to state enterprises to change their operational 
mechanism and establish a modern enterprise system." 
  After a pause, Minister Wu said: "Facts have proven that the 
development of foreign-funded enterprises is healthy on the 
whole, and their achievements are remarkable. This should be 
fully affirmed and appraised. But there are also problems. We 
should follow international standards to promote and ensure the 
healthy growth of foreign-funded enterprises. Viewed from the 
foreign-funded enterprises which have gone into operation, most 
of them have obtained better or considerable economic results 
and have attained their due interests in investing in China." 
  Minister Wu said enthusiastically: "Through 15 years of 
development, a large number of well-known foreign-funded 
enterprises have emerged. They have filled the gaps in domestic 
technology, scientific operational mechanism, enterprise 
management, social and economic efficiency, product quality and 
grade, capital and technology content, and foreign exchange 
earning through exports. All foreign-funded enterprises and 
domestic enterprises should learn from their experiences. 
Therefore, I am in favor of the long series on `Noted 
Foreign-Funded Enterprises in China' that is jointly being 
written by RENMIN RIBAO OVERSEAS EDITION and CHINA FOREIGN 
CAPITAL." 
  "What will be the main guide for foreign capital in the 
years 
ahead?" 
  "We will continue to follow the state's industrial policies; 
will vigorously guide foreign capital toward infrastructure and 
basic industries, toward the technical transformation of 
enterprises, and toward capital and technology intensive 
industries; and will gradually lift the restrictions on the 
service trades. We encourage foreign businessmen to invest in 
the following fields: Comprehensive agricultural development 
projects -- the energy, transportation, and essential raw 
materials industries that China badly needs; advanced 
technological projects; and projects that earn more foreign 
exchange through exports." 
  "In short, China has a variety of industries and offers an 
extensive scope for investment and great potential for 
development, which provides foreign investors with favorable 
conditions. We will unswervingly implement the open policy, 
further strengthen international and regional economic and 
technological cooperation based on equality and mutual benefit, 
and make contributions to economic prosperity and development."

<F P=106> [Report: "Conference on China Trade and Investment Opens in </F>
Hong Kong; Zheng Xilin, vice minister of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, Says Both Sides Suffer if the United 
States Revokes China's MFN Trading Status"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, Hong Kong's '94 China Trade and 
Investment Fair opened at the Hong Kong Conference and 
Exhibition Center. This is the largest fair of this type that 
the mainland has held in Hong Kong in recent years. Four 
ministries and state commissions and 24 provinces and 
municipalities have sent their delegations to the fair, where 
760 projects were arranged for inviting investment. Zheng Silin, 
vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, and 
other responsible officials from the ministries and state 
commissions concerned attended the opening ceremony of the fair 
and yesterday's symposium on China's foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  When attending these activities yesterday in Hong Kong, 
Zheng 
Silin said that China opposed the practice of linking human 
rights and other non-trade issues with most-favored-nation 
status. If the United States revokes China's MFN status, both 
sides will incur losses and China will not be the only side 
harmed. As for whether China will terminate the current 
favorable policies in order to meet the GATT regulations on the 
treatment of nationals, Zheng Silin said that China will not 
terminate the current favorable policies for the five special 
economic zones and other open cities, but will gradually bring 
the policies toward state-owned enterprises and other areas into 
line with the policies for the foreign-funded enterprises, the 
special economic zones, and the open cities. He said that China 
is comprehensively considering how to bring its foreign trade 
policy better into line with the relevant GATT regulations and 
other international practices, such as in the aspects of the tax 
policy and the equal competition mechanism. The foreign-funded 
enterprises will enjoy treatment equal to that enjoyed by 
Chinese nationals, and the investment environment will be 
further improved so that foreign investors' interests in China 
will enjoy double guarantees from both domestic and 
international law. 
  When mentioning the prospects for China's import and export 
trade, Zheng Silin said that China's basic policy for foreign 
trade is to seek a general balance between imports and exports 
under the premise of maintaining the necessary foreign exchange 
reserves. Increasing exports in order to ensure a sustained 
increase in imports is the positive method China has used to 
seek a balance in trade. It is expected that the volume of 
China's imports will reach $1,000 billion over the next seven 
years. 
  Ma Xiuhong, deputy director of the Foreign Investment 
Management Department of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation, also indicated on the same occasion that, 
as the amount of foreign investment is increasing, the Chinese 
Government will attach greater importance to investment made by 
transnational corporations which possess advanced technology and 
management expertise. In particular, it will encourage 
transnational corporations to invest in capital-intensive and 
technology-intensive projects. China has selectively approved 
the establishment of foreign investment companies which are 
allowed to invest in many industries, many fields, and many 
geographic areas and which are allowed to manage and provide 
comprehensive services for their investment projects in China. 
China is considering the relevant policies for the 
establishment of transnational corporations' Asia-Pacific 
headquarters, Asian headquarters, China headquarters, and 
regional management organs in China. 
  Ma Xiuhong said: Between 1979 and 1993, China approved a 
total of 174,000 foreign investment projects in China. The 
agreements for these projects involved more than $220 billion in 
foreign funds, and foreign investors actually injected over $60 
billion in funding. Funds from Hong Kong and Macao ranked first 
in terms of the amounts of investment from outside the mainland. 
By the end of 1993, Hong Kong and Macao businessmen set up over 
110,000 investment enterprises, and the investment in the 
relevant agreements exceeded $150 billion, with over $39 billion 
being actually used.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (CNS) -- The Minister of Finance 
Mr. Liu Zhongli said that imposition of land added value tax had 
to take place because it was a decree issued by the State 
Council. 
  Mr. Liu said recently that such tax had to be levied in 
various regions, and no alternative policy was possible in 
localities. He added that opinion and proposals on the land 
added value tax offered by some regions would be taken into 
consideration by the state when it worked out detailed 
regulations for the implementation. 
  The minister, however, said that the time table for 
formulation of the regulations had not yet been finalized. He 
added that such taxation was considered an effective measure to 
curb occupation of land on one's own for exploitation, land 
speculation and flat speculation. The state, however, would 
lend its support to construction of housing and development of 
real estate. 
  There are to date some 60 countries and regions to impose 
direct tax on revenue resulting from the transfer of land and in 
some cases tax is also levied on revenue obtained from buildings 
standing on it.

  [Text] Beijing, May 23 (XINHUA) -- The reform and opening 
up drive launched by China 15 years ago has not only brought the 
country huge economic progress, but also put it among the 
world's leading tourism powers. 
  According to world tourism organization statistics, the 
number of tourists visiting China increased by an annual average 
of 13 percent to 40 million in the last eight years -- the 
highest growth rate in the world. In addition, the annual 
average tourism revenue topped 4.67 billion U.S. dollars in 
foreign exchange. 
  Official statistics showed that between 1978 and 1993, the 
annual average increase of China's overseas tourism revenue 
stood at 21 percent, which is considered one of the highest in 
the world. 
  The above figures bear witness to the fact that China has 
really become one of the world's tourism powers. 
  Liu Yi, head of the State Tourism Administration, said in an 
interview with XINHUA here today that China has become one of 
the world's most important tourism markets, in the midst of 
fierce international competition. 
  According to the senior official, China has the advantages 
of 
rich natural tourism resources and numerous historical remains 
and sites. 
  He added that by now China has developed regular tourist 
relations with more than 100 countries. In the 15 main 
countries from which tourists have come to China, such as the 
Republic of Korea, Singapore, the U.S. and Australia, the number 
of tourists visiting China increased by a big margin in the 
first three months of this year. 
  The official statistics show that in the first quarter this 
year, China received a total of 1.59 million overseas tourists 
in group tours, up 9.2 percent on the same period of 1993. 
  Liu, the leading official in charge of China's tourism, also 
said that the foreign travel agents who specialize in organizing 
group tours to China have increased from 400 five years ago to 
over 60,000 at present. They help a lot in attracting overseas 
tourists to China, he said. 
  According to Liu, China has successfully launched a series 
of 
tourism years such as "Visit China '92", "China River and 
Mountain Tours '93", which produced effective results. 
  The administrator expects the ongoing "China Heritage '94" 
to 
have a greater success. 
  According to Liu, China is also planning Folk Customs Tour 
'95, China Vocational Tour '96 and China Travel Year '97, which 
are expected to further boost China's still growing tourism 
industry.

<F P=106> ["Viewpoint" column by Li Yining, head of Beijing </F>
University's Department of Economics and Management, member of 
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress: 
"Rising Grain Prices Put Neglected Agriculture in the 
Spotlight"] 
  [Text] The rise in grain purchase prices in urban areas 
since the last quarter of last year has caused unrest among 
residents and has become a cause of serious concern for the 
government. 
  During the annual plenary session of the National People's 
Congress in March city and provincial representatives demanded a 
guaranteed increase in grain production. 
  The representatives have also demanded balanced supply and 
demand in the grain market, in a highly publicised campaign. 
  The rise in the grain price is a complicated issue. 
  Although consumers are paying more when buying grain, 
peasants' incomes have not increased as a result. 
  Even though the price of grain has increased, the extent of 
the increase has been unable to match that of agricultural raw 
materials and equipment such as fertiliser, diesel, farm 
machinery and components. 
  While there is a surplus of agricultural workers, there is a 
serious shortage of people who actually work the land. Most of 
those who work the land are elderly people and women. 
  As such, grain production can by no means be neglected. 
  The primary reason for the soaring price of grain in recent 
years is that little emphasis has been placed on farming. 
  This is because farming offers very low profit margins. 
  It has been suggested that the annual consumption of grain 
per capita is falling, against an increase in overall grain 
production in China. 
  Moreover, the pricing of grain in China is mainly affected 
by 
the distribution system. An inefficient distribution system 
will result in a lack of grain supply in some areas and this 
means that both consumers and peasants will suffer. 
  To a certain extent, the suggestion that grain consumption 
is 
falling against an increase in production is correct. But it 
does not pinpoint the central issue. 
  In fact, the problem lies more on the production side than 
in 
the distribution system. 
  Annual grain consumption per capita among the rural 
population has not dropped significantly. It is because grain 
consumption by urban residents has fallen, against soaring 
consumption of pork, poultry and eggs. 
  But how will the production of pork and poultry increase if 
there is no feed for the animals? If grain production is not 
increased, no balance can be fixed between supply and demand in 
the grain market. 
  Eventually, it will be difficult to stabilise the grain 
price 
even if the efficiency of distribution is improved. 
  Boosting the efficiency of the distribution process is 
imperative, to ensure that both peasants and consumers are 
protected. 
  Devoting more emphasis to agricultural production to ensure 
growth in grain production will be an immediate move towards 
stabilising the pricing of grain. 
  This could be done in three ways. 
  --The government should take on the role of building 
facilities to conserve water, to increase the area under 
irrigation and bolster precautionary measures against natural 
disasters. 
  --The government should offer incentives for farmers to 
devote more time to farming through its agricultural policy. 
  --The government should rely on town and village enterprises 
in a move to increase agricultural production. 
  Finally, I would like to elaborate on stabilising grain 
prices. There are two ways this can be done: either the 
government fixes prices under a planned economy or the prices 
are left to market forces. 
  Previous experience has shown that pricing under a market 
economy has not worked in China. 
  Accordingly, stabilising grain prices through government 
mechanisms would not necessarily mean the country was returning 
to a planned economy.

"Beijing Encourages Foreign Firms To Invest in Large and Medium 
State Enterprises But Does Not Favor Acquisition or Share 
Purchases for the Time Being"] 
  [Text] A considerable number of state-owned enterprises in 
mainland China are in dire straits. An economic and trade 
official has pointed out in Hong Kong: Foreign firms are 
encouraged to invest in large and medium state-owned enterprises 
to conduct technological transformation, but, as the conditions 
are not yet ripe, foreign investment cannot be made in the form 
of share purchases. 
  Meng Xiangang, director of the Department of Foreign 
Economic 
Cooperation and Trade of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, said here yesterday that the mainland government is 
studying and formulating relevant policies, and foreign firms 
are encouraged to invest in large and medium enterprises for 
technological transformation. The mainland government will 
follow the key orientation of unequivocally encouraging foreign 
investment in technological transformation in light of state 
industrial policies, while drawing up corresponding measures of 
encouragement in several areas, such as credit, taxation, use of 
foreign exchange, and import and export administration. 
  Citing the example of over 5,000 new large and medium 
enterprises in the 12 provinces in the northeast and the north, 
Meng Xiangang said that one-third of them urgently need to 
undergo technological transformation. 
  However, he stressed that improving the state-owned 
enterprises' technological standards and helping their products 
more easily respond to market needs by integrating with foreign 
investment was a form of transforming the mechanism of 
state-owned enterprises, which is different from allowing 
foreign firms to buy up state-owned enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (CNS) -- There have so far been 
175,000 three type foreign-funded enterprises registered in 
China since the reform and opening to the outside world 14 years 
ago. Nearly 75,000 such enterprises meanwhile had their licence 
revoked with an average of 535 each year, according to a 
national meeting on administration of registration of 
foreign-funded enterprises which was being held in Hefei, Anhui 
Province. 
  Among the foreign-funded enterprises registered in China, 
Sino-foreign joint venture enterprises make up 107,000, 
Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises 25,500, and solely 
foreign-funded enterprises 34,000. The official in charge of 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce said that 
there were a handful of the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises in poor condition. Problems facing these 
enterprises included first, a false joint venture pattern in 
which a foreign party was only responsible for handling the 
necessary procedures without offering capital while in some 
cases the Chinese party provided foreign exchange or the foreign 
party offered renminbi as capital for joint venture. 
  Second, a few foreign businessmen made use of the 
preferential policy on foreign investment to commit smuggling, 
profiteering and capitalizing on the business licence for 
swindling under the guise of undertaking foreign-funded 
enterprises. 
  Third, some foreign investors made declaration of high 
prices 
which should have been lower while some others promoted the sale 
of poor quality equipment at a higher price. 
  Fourth, there was still over 40 percent of capital not in 
place while some investment existed in name only. 
  Fifth, some three types of foreign-funded enterprises ran 
illegally while some others even undertook pornographic business 
and gambling. 
  Enterprises in the red accounted for over 40 percent of the 
total each year since 1990 with the number of enterprises 
suffering a loss reaching 42.5 percent of the total in 1992. 
  Problems existing in foreign-funded enterprises were partly 
attributed to the government, the administrative as well as law 
enforcement departments, because they paid less attention to the 
quality of foreign-funded enterprises. In some cases local 
authorities worked out or adopted their own policy in violation 
of the state policy on and regulations of the foreign-funded 
enterprises.

  [Text] China welcomes foreign investment in manufacturing 
telecommunications equipment but will bar overseas companies 
from the industry's service sector in order to protect its own 
infant industry, a senior Chinese official says. 
  In response to confusion over China's policy, Xu Shanyan, a 
director-general in the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, also said yesterday foreign investors could 
not sell telecommunications equipment to China. Joint-venture 
manufacturing of equipment was allowed, he said. It was only 
the service sector they would be excluded from. 
  One of the reasons for shutting out foreigners was China 
needed to co-ordinate its policies and services and to link them 
up into a national network. Foreign participation would cause 
confusion. China's telecommunications industry was still in "a 
primitive stage", said Mr Xu. He added the move did not 
conflict with the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade which China wanted to join. But China did want to 
improve its manufacturing capabilities, he said. 
  "We would like to actively co-operate with foreign 
manufacturers. We are still exploring beneficial ways for 
foreign investment." Some foreigners are wary of China's 
demands. "The industry is moving so fast that we just can't 
move operations of our most advanced equipment to China," said 
one American businessman. 
  Mr Xu said by the end of the decade China could have as many 
as 140 million telephone lines, compared with about 40 million 
now, and the waiting list for installation could be reduced to 
one month from the current six or more months. China is due to 
spend about U.S.$41 billion over the next six years to create a 
telecommunications network. It will include massive 
construction of trunk optical cables, satellite earth stations, 
digital microwave lines, a postal air cargo system and expanded 
telephone exchange capacity. 
  In Beijing, the number of telephone lines increased from 
113,000 in 1980 to 560,000 in 1990. The city, with a population 
of 10.5 million people has a telephone exchange capacity of 1.05 
million lines with 663,000 actually installed. By the end of 
the year, capacity should rise to 1.54 million with 
installations at 970,000, according to Jia Yong, vice-director 
of the Beijing Telecommunications Administration.

  [Text] Unable to check the autonomy in southern China, 
Beijing is using its clout to ensure Shanghai is controlled, 
prosperous and an economic counterbalance to Hong 
Kong-Guangdong, says the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). "As 
the bonding between Guangzhou and Hong Kong intensifies, 
Shanghai is becoming increasingly vital to Beijing," the EIU 
says in its report "Shaping a business in Shanghai". 
  As Beijing's latest darling, Shanghai has the leverage to 
set 
a 10 to 12 per cent growth target, significantly higher than the 
nine per cent national ceiling. Also, it has the autonomy to 
approve foreign investment of up to US$30 million, whereas other 
cities are limited to US$10 million. Bigger projects need 
Beijing's green light. 
  In return for these privileges, Beijing keeps a firm grip on 
Shanghai, more unbending on rules than in Guangzhou, but because 
of its trading heritage, it is less officious than the capital. 
Although Shanghai's bureaucracy can be tedious, it is more 
consistent and less corrupt than that of southern China. 
  Still, the report notes that "bribery has now begun to 
invade 
the traditional guanxi (personal connections) domain, and 
corruption is definitely on the increase ... most Shanghai 
corruption is masked as fees or taxes". Foreign companies 
should be aware of these practices and adopt a clear 
anti-corruption policy before putting money in the city, the 
report says. 
  Support from Beijing notwithstanding, Shanghai, like most 
Chinese cities, is plagued by infrastructure bottlenecks, which 
are aggravated by the rising inflow of foreign funds. Unlike 
Western cities, which set aside about 20 per cent of urban land 
for road systems, Shanghai allocates only five per cent, and its 
road system caters to only half of the city's needs. 
  Despite official statements to the contrary, Shanghai is 
also 
desperately short of power, although it is making great efforts 
to prevent severe shortages. Sources in the business community 
estimate supply meets only 85 per cent of demand, although it is 
managed astutely to accommodate economic zones, priority foreign 
enterprises, and foreign residential and office complexes. "The 
prognosis for the future is not bright," the report says. 
Demand for power in Shanghai-Pudong is estimated to be rising 
by about 15 per cent a year, and the figure could well apply to 
the Yangtze Delta. 
  The shortage of land and labour is another concern. Wage 
inflation, staff turnover, and dearth of office space are 
particularly worrying. Availability of top-notch office space 
declined from 15.2 per cent in December 1992 to 1.1 per cent of 
total stock by March this year. 
  Despite the bottlenecks foreign investors are flocking to 
the 
city because of its vast potential consumer market, where 
discretionary income among urban workers is estimated to be 43 
per cent, among the highest in the world. Foreign ventures in 
Shanghai producing goods for the domestic market have a range of 
distribution options, including the state distribution system 
and government wholesalers. "All promise unbeatable 
distribution networks. All require careful inspection," says 
the report.

  [Text] The China Land and Real Estate Market, which opened 
in Beijing on Wednesday [18 May], will regulate the country's 
fledgling property trade, the government said. 
  The market, approved by the State Land Administration (SLA) 
and the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, will be a 
non-profit making agency controlling and servicing land and real 
estate dealers. 
  The market will sell land-use rights, oversee commercial 
transfers of the rights and regulate real estate sales. 
  The market is empowered to act as an estate agent, 
evaluating 
land, advertising land for sale and providing legal consultation 
services. 
  The move will help set up "an open, fair and just allocation 
mechanism of land," according to State Land Administration 
director Zou Yuchuan. 
  Central and provincial government will be responsible for 
working out the country's industrial and urban land-use plan, he 
said. 
  Zou said that other agencies involved in land deals would be 
put under State control. 
  The land management boss hinted that the government was 
going 
to stop handing out free land-use licenses for State-owned real 
estate. 
  The government was planning to sell land or lease it to the 
highest bidder, he said.

  [Text] Jiangsu Province plans to continue pioneering 
speedy economic growth in coastal areas and will usher in a new 
boom in the real estate industry in the coming months. 
  Two regulations to be introduced in Jiangsu later this year 
will ensure a sound development of its fledgling property 
market, provincial authorities announced in Beijing yesterday. 
  The move is part of the efforts to regulate its bustling 
real 
estate business and ensure a healthy economic growth, said Wu 
Tingxiang, deputy director of the General Office of Jiangsu. 
  The first drafts of regulations on real estate management 
and 
development are now being examined by the Provincial People s 
Congress and the provincial administration. 
  Meanwhile, a bill governing urban construction is likely to 
be endorsed next month, Wu said. 
  The province also plans to expand its foreign-oriented 
production and foreign trade and speed up its infrastructure and 
basic industries. 
  On Sunday, Premier Li Peng concluded a six-day tour of the 
province inspecting its progress in all spheres, the Xinhua News 
Agency reported on Monday. 
  The premier praised the province for a rapid economic 
development and remarkably improving urban and rural living 
standards, the report said. 
  Last year, the gross domestic product of Jiangsu reached 255 
billion yuan ($29.3 billion), an 18.5 per cent increase over 
1992. 
  According to Wu, Jiangsu is striving to expand its 
industries 
in all possible ways. 
  In transport, projects are well under way for construction 
of 
the Nanjing-Shanghai Expressway, the Nanjing-Lianyung highway, 
and dredging the part of the Great Canal in Jiangsu. 
  And it is also speeding up work on the new Nanjing Airport, 
the Yangtze Highway Bridge in Jiangyin and a new railway in 
Jiangsu. 
  In infrastructure, construction is continuing on 10 
state-level development zones, and 48 provincial-level 
development zones. 
  Real estate, as one of the province's pillar industries, is 
now enjoying a boom in Jiangsu, Wu said. 
  The number of real estate firms reached 2,400 last year, 
27.5 
per cent of which are joint-ventures. 
  Last year, more than 13 billion yuan ($1.49 billion) was 
spent in the sector in constructing commercial and residential 
buildings, taking up 12 per cent of Jiangsu's investment in 
fixed assets.

  [Text] From 22 to 23 May, after leading responsible 
comrades of the departments directly under the provincial 
authorities to attend the forum on economic work of three 
provinces convened by Comrade Zhu Rongji in Henan Province, Zhao 
Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and 
governor of Shandong Province, travelled to Heze and Jining to 
conduct investigation and inspect work. 
  When talking about the current economic work, Zhao Zhihao 
stressed: All levels of departments in the province should pay 
close attention to summer planting, harvesting, and field 
management in a timely manner to ensure bumper harvest and 
should be meticulous in organizing economic operation with focus 
on improving economic efficiency in order to resolve conspicuous 
problems and promote the sustained and sound development of the 
provincial economy. 
  Zhao Zhihao said: From January to April, the general 
economic situation of the province was very good; various 
reforms, particularly the reforms of finance, tax, investment 
enterprises, and foreign exchange management, proceeded 
smoothly; old systems were giving way to the new steadily; and 
positive and remarkable results were achieved in economic 
development. However, some conspicuous contradictions and 
problems also existed in economic operation. In particular, 
deficits of enterprises increased, more enterprises faced 
difficulties, and the margin of price hikes was high. All 
levels of departments must pay high attention to these problems. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed: This year, wheat is doing well 
throughout the province, and the wheatfields promise a good 
harvest. All levels of departments should be prepared in 
ideology and work and seize the current good opportunity to 
quickly harvest and thresh wheat in order to reap a bumper 
harvest. At the same time, good preparations should be made for 
the sowing of summer cotton in order to sow as much cotton as 
possible. All levels of grain management departments should 
voluntarily and conscientiously make preparations for procuring 
summer grain. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed: We should successfully organize the 
operation of industrial economy by firmly persisting in the 
central task of improving economic efficiency. We should go all 
out to promote sales and increase the marketing rate of 
products. We should resolutely correct the erroneous tendency 
of blindly competing for high-speed development. We should 
exert great efforts in improving enterprise management and 
strictly controlling the quality of products, the cost of 
production, and the operation of funds with a view to improving 
economic efficiency, by focusing on straightening out and 
strengthening leading bodies of enterprises and on strengthening 
the basic work. We should go all out to help the enterprises 
facing difficulties find out the roots of their problems and 
study how to develop themselves in the future. Great efforts 
should also be made to help such enterprises resolve their 
problems concerning livelihood of workers. 
  Zhao Zhihao stressed emphatically: All levels of governments 
and responsible departments should organize forces to go deep 
into enterprises to help them resolve their practical problems. 
They should seize the current opportunity and resolutely depend 
on reforms to resolve problems for the small and medium-sized 
enterprises that have long been operated at a lose.

  [Text] Hangzhou, May 25 (XINHUA) -- Township-run 
enterprises, an economic power-house in east China's Zhejiang 
Province, will continue to thrive despite temporary 
difficulties, according to a provincial government official. 
  Qian Xinhao, deputy director of the provincial bureau of 
township-run enterprises, said that Zhejiang currently has more 
than 100,000 such enterprises. 
  They manufactured 300 billion yuan worth of goods in 1993, 
accounting for 75 percent of Zhejiang's gross domestic product, 
the value of goods and services produced province wide, he said. 
  That figure also formed 11 percent of the output value of 
rural industries throughout China, he added. 
  Under the tax reform begun earlier this year, rural 
companies 
no longer enjoy lower tax rates as they did before, Qian said. 
  Moreover, most of them are now suffering from acute 
shortages 
of funds because the Chinese government has tightened credit 
control in an effort to ensure top-priority construction 
projects, he said. 
  Consequently, the profits of rural businesses plunged nearly 
27 percent in the first quarter of 1994 to 679 million yuan, he 
said. 
  "Even so, the development momentum of rural enterprises in 
Zhejiang is good on the whole," he said. 
  For example, output value of these enterprises amounted to 
111.2 billion yuan during the first four months of 1994, up 80 
percent over the same period in 1993. 
  To overcome the present difficulties, rural enterprises have 
accelerated the introduction of the joint-stock cooperative 
system, he said. 
  According to Qian, the new system has turned workers into 
shareholders and has tied up shareholders' incomes and fringe 
benefits with their enterprises, thus resulting in higher 
productivity. 
  To date, over 60,000 rural businesses have introduced the 
new 
system, he said. 
  "Many rural enterprises have shifted their attention to the 
international market," he said. 
  So far, 119 rural firms have opened factories and 
subsidiaries in other countries. 
  For example, the Zhedong Cement Pipe Factory in Yinxian 
county has built a factory in the Philippines at a cost of 15 
million yuan in a move to break into the local market. 
  Furthermore, rural enterprises in Zhejiang are trying to 
promote cooperation with their colleagues in underdeveloped 
central and western parts of China, he said. 
  They have proposed 100 major projects for cooperation with 
township-run enterprises in Henan province and the Xinjiang 
Uygur Autonomous Region. 
  The deputy director also noted that production of rural 
firms 
set up by groups of farmers or individual farmers has been 
growing rapidly. 
  During the January-April period, output value of such firms 
amounted to 45.2 billion yuan, up 182 percent on the same period 
in 1993, he said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, May 24 (CNS) -- Guangdong Province has 
been concentrating on the consolidation of public security there 
since this year. Special campaigns against criminals at railway 
lines and robbery of automobiles have achieved initial results 
and public order is now turning for the better. 
  In recent years, the province has seen an increasingly grim 
public security situation which has become a hotpoint of common 
concerns. 
  According to three surveys conducted in recent three years, 
among five items with which residents in the province are 
unsatisfactory, the situation of public security had twice 
topped the list and ranked the second for one time. 74.4 
percent to 81.5 percent of residents there are unsatisfactory 
with the situation of public security [paragraph as received]. 
  The police force in the province has organized a number of 
campaigns against crimes this year. During the period of the 
Lunar New Year, they waged a special campaign against criminals 
committing crimes at railway lines with more than 5000 cases 
dealt with and nearly 3000 criminals from more than 200 gangs 
seized. In April, the police force staged another special 
campaign against the robbery of automobiles with over 2900 cases 
dealt with, over 2300 cars seized and more than 2400 criminals 
from 490 gangs arrested. 
  The province has seen more than 10 million migrant people 
flowing in every year which also formed the reason for the 
increase in the number of crimes there. The crimes committed by 
some migrant people covered more than half of the total number 
of criminal cases in the Province. 
  In addition, according to statistics of police force, more 
than 40000 criminal cases occurred in the province from January 
to April this year, over 10 percent up than the same period of 
last year, and the number of big cases showed high growth in 
particular. 
  The police force there has taken two new measures to 
consolidate public security. First, more than 4000 policemen 
have gone on patrol in the medium- and large-scale cities of the 
Province, and county towns and the above county-town cities will 
all have their policemen on patrol by the end of this year. 
Second, the administration over migrant people will be 
strengthened.

  [Text] After successfully completing various agendas with 
joint efforts of all its deputies, the Second Session of the 
Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress ended 
victoriously on the afternoon of 24 May. 
  The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional 
People's Congress held its fourth meeting at the People's Hall 
of Tibet. Comrade Raidi, executive chairman of the session and 
chairman of the session's presidium standing committee, chaired 
the meeting. 
  Seated at the rostrum's front row were chairmen of the 
session's presidium standing committee Puqung, Zheng Ying, 
Sengqen Lozong Gyaincain, Pudoje, Namgyai, Samding Doje Pamo, 
(Deqing Quzhen), Gong Daxi, Tian Fujun, Baima Duoji, (Yongzhong 
Dawa), and (Cui Jiguo). 
  Also seated at the rostrum were Pagbalha Geleg Namgyai, vice 
chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee; 
and leaders of the autonomous regional party committee and 
government Chen Kuiyuan, Gyaincain Norbu, Basang, Hu Yongzhu, Zi 
Cheng, Lieque, Buqiong, and (Lu Huimin). 
  Other than members of the session's presidium, those sitting 
at the rostrum also included leaders of the autonomous regional 
government, the regional Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference committee, the Tibet Military District, the regional 
people's armed police corps, the regional higher people's court, 
and the regional people's procuratorate. 
  The number of deputies who were supposed to attend the 
meeting was 448; 36 requested a leave of absence due to sickness 
or other reasons. The number of attending deputies was 362, 
enough to qualify for a quorum. 
  Attending the meeting as observers were the secretary 
general 
of the autonomous regional people's government; deputy 
secretaries general of the autonomous regional people's congress 
standing committee; comrades in charge of various autonomous 
regional departments, bureaus, commissions, institutions of 
higher learning, Tibet-based offices from other inland provinces 
and municipalities, and units under the party Central Committee; 
and comrades in charge of various prefectures, cities, and 
counties. 
  Voting with a show of hands at the meeting, the deputies 
adopted a resolution on the government work report. After 
careful deliberation, the meeting held: With joint efforts of 
governments at various levels, Tibet remarkably accelerated its 
pace of reform and opening up in 1993. Tibet has further 
developed its economy, has further enhanced its political 
stability, has further fostered unity among nationalities, and 
has accomplished new achievements in various construction 
projects. 
  The meeting urged: Governments at various levels should 
earnestly study socialist market economic theories, liberate the 
mind, change their functions, improve workstyles, 
comprehensively perform practical work, immerse themselves among 
the masses, industriously and practically administer their work, 
and handle and carry out concrete tasks. They should 
conscientiously implement and enforce laws and regulations; 
administer their work according to law; and continually improve 
their capability and competence to lead the drive for reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization. 
  The meeting urged: Rallying around the party Central 
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, Tibet's people 
of various nationalities should closely unite. Under the 
leadership of the regional party committee, we should be of one 
heart and one mind; be united and forge ahead; greet the 
autonomous regional 30th founding anniversary with outstanding 
accomplishments; work hard; and wage arduous struggles to 
facilitate a healthy, rapid, and sustained development [jian 
kang kuai su chi xu fa zhan] of Tibet's economy and bring about 
all-round social progress. 
  The meeting also unanimously adopted a resolution on the 
implementation of Tibet's economic and social development plans 
in 1993 and on the plans of Tibet's economic and social 
development in 1994; adopted a resolution on Tibet's final 
financial accounts in 1993 and on Tibet's budget in 1994; 
adopted a resolution on a Tibet Autonomous Regional People's 
Congress Standing Committee work report; adopted a resolution on 
an autonomous regional higher people's court work report; and 
adopted a resolution on an autonomous regional people's 
procuratorate work report. 
  Raidi, executive chairman of the session and chairman of 
the autonomous regional people's congress, delivered an 
important speech at the meeting. 
  He said: The Second Session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress has strictly stressed the central 
topics regarding stability, reform, and development; has paid 
close attention to the overall situation of seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside 
world, enhancing development, and maintaining stability; and has 
fully promoted the spirit of democracy, unity, motivational 
atmosphere, and realism [min zhu tuan jie gu jin qiu shi]. All 
the deputies have liberated their minds, sought truth from 
facts, freely expressed their views, pooled the masses' wisdom, 
and earnestly deliberated and adopted a government work report 
delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu and various other items of 
the session's agenda. The meeting has further specified the 
guiding ideologies, basic guiding principles, and major missions 
for us to perform Tibet's work in 1994. 
  Comrade Raidi pointed out: The key to implementing the 
session's guidelines is to correctly handle relations among 
stability, reform, and development. While maintaining 
stability, we should strive to enhance reform and development; 
and should, in turn, promote social stability with enhanced 
reform and development. Stability is the prerequisite, reform 
is the driving force, and development is the foundation. All 
three are supplementary and complimentary to one another. We 
definitely cannot pay more attention to one while neglecting the 
others. 
  He said: The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet to conduct 
comprehensive reform, to advance forward in an all-around 
manner, to make major breakthroughs in certain aspects, and to 
accelerate its pace of establishing a socialist market economy. 
We should unwaveringly uphold the basic line of one central 
task and two basic points, earnestly implement various session 
resolutions, seize favorable opportunities, deepen reform, 
accelerate development, and maintain stability. 
  At present, Tibet has political stability, stable popular 
support, social stability, unity among nationalities, and a 
solid border defense. However, many unstable factors still 
exist. Particularly, domestic and foreign splittist elements 
have ganged up with international hostile forces. They are 
intensifying, in every possible way, their splittist and 
sabotaging activities. We must thoroughly launch antisplittist 
struggles; must sternly crack down on various splittist 
activities; and must make vigorous efforts to safeguard the 
motherland's unification, to strengthen unity among 
nationalities, to protect Tibet's political stability, and to 
ensure smooth progress in Tibet's economic construction, reform, 
and opening up. 
  Raidi pointed out: At present, the principal tasks for 
people's congresses at various levels in Tibet are to earnestly 
implement the session's guidelines, to take into account Tibet's 
realities while continually keeping close contacts with the 
realities of life and conducting investigations and studies, to 
rally efforts to establish a socialist market economy, to 
develop Tibet's economy, to launch antisplittist struggles, to 
maintain political stability, to strengthen legislative work, to 
publicize general legal knowledge, to upgrade law-enforcement, 
to further improve the system of people's congress, and to fully 
protect the democratic rights of people who are masters of their 
own affairs and destiny. Leading cadres at various levels must 
further improve their understanding, change their workstyles, 
and perform realistic tasks. 
  Comrade Raidi eventually expressed his hope: After returning 
to their respective posts, all the deputies should continually 
publicize the session's guidelines; implement the session's 
resolutions; and accomplish new results in enhancing reform, 
opening up, economic construction, social stability, democracy, 
and the legal system in Tibet. 
  At 1640 [0840 GMT], the Second Session of the Sixth Tibet 
Autonomous Regional People's Congress closed victoriously amidst 
the rousing national anthem.

"Implement the Guidelines of the Two Sessions, Promote 
Development and Stability -- Congratulating the Successful 
Conclusion of the Second Session of the Sixth Regional People's 
Congress and the Second Session of the Sixth Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference Regional Committee"] 
  [Text] The second sessions of the sixth regional people's 
congress and the sixth Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC] regional committee, which have attracted the 
attention of the people of all nationalities in Tibet, 
successfully concluded after completing all items on their 
respective agendas. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the 
party's basic line, people's congress deputies and CPPCC members 
focused their attention on the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability; displayed the spirit of democracy 
and awareness of participating in the discussion and 
administration of state affairs; diligently examined and 
deliberated the government work report and other reports with a 
profound sense of responsibility as masters of the region; and 
offered suggestions to jointly lay the general principles for 
Tibet's construction. As a result, these two sessions are 
congregations of democracy, realism, unity, and courageous 
advance. 
  The deputies and members highly evaluated Chairman Gyaincain 
Norbu's government work report. They said: The report 
realistically affirmed last year's achievements while 
identifying with a cool head difficulties and problems on the 
road of advance. The clearly defined fighting goal and 
arrangements, as well as effective measures for the work of this 
year, accord with the realities in Tibet, reflect the vital 
interests and aspirations of the people of all nationalities in 
the region, and will certainly inspire cadres and people of all 
nationalities to work hard and confidently and to strive to 
fulfill the various tasks laid by the sessions for Tibet. 
  The general principles and tasks for Tibet's work for this 
year have been set and clarified. What is important now is 
their implementation. All localities and departments should 
earnestly transmit and study the two sessions' guidelines; 
should familiarize themselves with the government work report 
and other relevant reports; and, in the light of reality, should 
summarize and check last year's work on the basis of the 
guidelines. We should recognize our achievements to strengthen 
our confidence and fighting spirit, as well as our shortcomings 
and defects to enhance the sense of urgency and try our utmost 
to catch up with other provinces and regions. We should judge 
the hour and size up the situation, correctly analyzing the 
situation and work conditions and broadening our vision to 
formulate fighting goals and tasks that can be achieved through 
hard work. We should work out practical and effective measures 
to translate the sessions' guidelines into concrete actions of 
the people of all nationalities. 
  Promoting a sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the 
regional economy was one of the main topics discussed in the two 
sessions, as well as the central task to which we must pay close 
attention. Reform is the powerful motive force for development. 
In recent years, Tibet has seized the opportunity for deepening 
reform and opening up wider, thereby promoting economic and 
social development and maintaining political stability. This 
year is crucial for Tibet in carrying out comprehensive reform, 
to combine package reform programs with breakthroughs in key 
areas, and to accelerate the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. In accordance with the unified arrangements 
made by the people's congress session, we should make reform the 
top priority of the overall situation, strengthen the intensity 
of reform, work out well-conceived plans for implementation, and 
instill new vitality into the reform programs aimed at 
establishing a new socialist market economic system and 
achieving a sustained development of the economy. 
  Changing the operating mechanisms, optimizing the structure, 
improving the management, popularizing technological advances, 
and increasing labor productivity are the starting points as 
well as the basis of our economic work. We should further 
strengthen the position of agriculture and animal husbandry as 
the foundation of the regional economy; develop village and 
township enterprises; increase incomes of peasants and herdsmen; 
step up energy, transportation, communications, and other 
infrastructure construction; and continue to implement the 
regulations [for changing the operating mechanisms of large and 
medium state enterprises] to reinvigorate enterprises to more 
successfully carry out this year's economic tasks through the 
efforts of all circles and to fulfill and overfulfill the 
fighting goal of an 8 percent increase in Tibet's gross regional 
product. 
  We should adhere to the principle of firmly grasping two 
links at the same time in further stabilizing the situation and 
creating favorable conditions and a healthy social environment 
for deepening reform and accelerating development. This is an 
important matter to which we must always pay close attention. 
The two sessions affirmed Tibet's achievements and successful 
experiences in promoting stability, and forwarded measures for 
promoting greater stability. To further promote stability, it 
is imperative to launch an in-depth struggle against separatism. 
The struggle between separatists and antiseparatists is a 
serious political struggle concerning the vital interests of the 
Chinese people of all nationalities, including the Tibetans. 
Under the new situation, separatist forces inside and outside 
the territory have stepped up collusion with hostile forces 
abroad, continuously readjusting their strategy and tactics and 
intensifying activities to split the motherland. Separatist 
activities remain the main factor undermining Tibet's stability. 
The struggle between separatists and antiseparatists will be a 
protracted, acute, and complex. We should keep a cool head 
without the slightest lowering of our guard, correctly analyze 
the situation, actively carry out work, ensure effective 
propaganda and education with clear objectives in mind, reply on 
grass-roots organizations, and mobilize and organize the masses 
to voluntarily take part in the struggle against separatism. 
Moreover, we should use the power of the people's democratic 
dictatorship to resolutely strike at separatist activities. 
Meanwhile, we should harshly punish criminal offenders and go 
all out to strengthen the comprehensive management of social 
security and to improve public order in Tibet. 
  The new situation, arduous tasks, and the people's 
expectations demand leading cadres at all levels to study 
conscientiously, to change their style, and to work hard. We 
must thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's line, 
principles, and policies; we should study information regarding 
market economy and other fields; and we should further 
emancipate our minds and update our concepts. We should 
skillfully integrate theory with practice, be bold in practice 
and innovation, and carry out our work creatively. We should be 
sober minded and attach great importance to studying new 
circumstances and problems cropping up in the process of 
deepening reform, pay attention to problems that are latent and 
still in the embryonic stage, and take active measures to solve 
them. We should bring into play the spirit of hard work, go 
down to the grass roots regularly to mingle with the masses and 
to attentively listen to their voices and demands, carry out 
effective propaganda and education, and solve practical problems 
for the masses. We should popularize the masses' advanced 
experiences and examples in reform, opening up, developing the 
economy, and promoting stability; and should channel the 
enthusiasm of all circles to deepen reform, promote development, 
and maintain stability. 
  The realization of the comparatively well-off stage before 
the end of this century will present us with a more beautiful 
future. However, this stage will not arrive in Tibet 
automatically. Under the kind concern of the central 
authorities and the support of all fraternal nationalities, we 
should rely on the people of all nationalities in Tibet; bring 
into play the spirit of hard struggle; and work assiduously, 
creatively, and in a down-to-earth manner. Beginning today, we 
should further strengthen unity, heighten our spirits, and pool 
the efforts of all to realize the magnificent plan formulated by 
the two sessions so as to march toward and realize the 
comparatively well-off stage with expeditious and solid steps.

<F P=106> [Article by XIZANG RIBAO reporter: "Tibet Scores Successes </F>
in Anticorruption Drive"] 
  [Text] Thanks to earnest, resolute, and concrete action, 
the majority of localities and departments in Tibet have 
recently scored initial successes in the three tasks of the 
anticorruption drive. 
  In line with the "Decision on Several Tasks to be Seriously 
Carried Out in the Anticorruption Drive in the Near Future," 
adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council, 
and with the guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the regional party 
committee and regional government, as well as the regional 
discipline inspection commission and regional supervision 
department, mapped out specific plans for intensifying the 
anticorruption drive and promoting the construction of party 
work style and a clean government. Party committees and 
governments at all levels have attached great importance to the 
anticorruption drive, adopting a resolute attitude and taking 
prompt action; while large numbers of party members and cadres 
and the masses have energetically supported and actively 
participated in the drive. As a result, certain achievements 
have been made in the fight against corruption. 
  These achievements are manifested in the following: Leading 
cadres have earnestly carried out self-examination and made 
prompt correction in accordance with the five requirements for 
clean standards and self-discipline. To ensure a good job of 
self-examination and correction, all prefectures (cities) and 
departments held democratic meetings, during which leading 
cadres voluntarily accepted supervision by the masses. 
According to incomplete statistics, as of the end of 1993, 76 
percent of leading cadres at and above the county (section) 
level had conducted self-examination and correction and found 
problems in the following aspects: While screening economic 
entities affiliated with party and government organizations and 
concurrent jobs held by party and government cadres, some found 
themselves to have been involved in compensated intermediate 
activities, or sightseeing trips in a disguised way outside the 
country (territory). A fairly large number of party and 
government cadres found themselves to have taken part in 
gambling or accepted dinner invitations, gifts, or cash while 
attending weddings or funerals or performing official duties. A 
number of cases involving violations of the law and discipline 
were investigated. As of the end of 1993, discipline inspection 
and supervision organs in the region had received a total of 681 
tips on such cases from the masses. Of these, 349 were accepted 
initially. After investigation and verification, 58 persons 
were punished according to party and administrative discipline; 
and 10 were turned over to the judicial organ for further 
investigation of their criminal responsibilities. As a result, 
the state and collectives recovered 1.145 million yuan in 
economic losses. Meanwhile, quite a few departments and units 
took the initiative to investigate and solve some serious 
problems reported by the masses. 
  To lighten the burdens on farmers and herdsmen at large, 
fees 
collected by various localities and departments were also 
screened. After screening 177 fees and the standards of 1,337 
fees, a total of 1.761 million yuan were found to have been 
collected in violation of discipline and were turned over to the 
treasury. As a result of the screening, the regional government 
abolished 31 unreasonable fees, while various prefectural (city) 
governments abolished 216 unreasonable fees.

<F P=106> [By Zhao Shulan (6392 3219 5695) and Ge Xiquan (5514 6007 </F>
0538): "The Key to Successfully Carrying Out Family Planning 
Work Lies in Leadership and Efforts Should Be Made To Cope With 
the New Situation and To Actively Promote Reform of the Cadre 
System"] 
  [Excerpts] "In rural work, we should persist in making an 
overall plan for attaining a better-off level of moderate 
prosperity and simultaneously attending to economic and family 
planning work, and select cadres with education and economic 
knowledge to the forefront of economic construction to assume 
posts in villages where economic work is weak to lead the 
peasants' march towards the goal of becoming better-off." This 
requirement was set forth by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, to county and township cadres when 
he inspected the work of Wuqiang County on 8 May. 
  Accompanied by Bai Runzhang, secretary of the Hengshui 
Prefectural party committee, and Commissioner Yang Xinnong, 
Cheng Weigao listened to briefings given by Wuqiang County party 
committee and government leaders on the whole county's economic 
development and family planning work, and held a forum on 
relevant issues. He also travelled to Hebei Kewei Electronics 
Company, Ltd., Wuqiang County New Year pictures museum, and 
other units to inspect their work. [passage omitted] 
  Cheng Weigao demanded: To successfully carry out the whole 
county's work, it is necessary to persist in making an overall 
plan to become better-off with a moderate level of prosperity. 
We must persist in simultaneously grasping both economic and 
family planning work. We must not direct attention only to 
economic construction at the expense of population work or 
blindly persist in improving backwardness in family planning at 
the expense of economic development. To grasp these two tasks, 
we must urge leading cadres to further emancipate their minds, 
cultivate the concept of market economy and a strong pioneering 
spirit, act in line with the objectives and demands, make all 
levels implement the plan aimed at becoming well-off, implement 
the plan in townships and villages, and mobilize cadres to 
undertake this formidable task. Meanwhile, it is necessary to 
formulate plans for developing primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries for the whole county. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: We should exert efforts to grasp 
reform of the organizational and cadre systems and do a good job 
in resolving the issue on building the mechanisms of restraint 
and incentive for the selection and appointment of cadres. It 
is necessary to streamline administrative organs, mobilize 
cadres of party and government organs with education and 
economic knowledge to run economic entities on the forefront of 
economic construction, to assume posts in village-level 
organizations, and to lead peasants to attain the goal of 
becoming fairly well-off. If no pressure is imposed on a cadre, 
he will not have motivation and creativity. Through the 
establishment of the mechanisms of restraints and incentives, we 
should realistically judge cadres in accordance to the party 
spirit, use cadres in accordance to their achievements in 
official career, select outstanding cadres to leading posts, and 
eliminate incompetent cadres. 
  Cheng Weigao stressed: The key to realizing the goal of 
becoming well-off, accelerating reform, opening up, and economic 
development, and doing a good job in family planning and 
building two civilizations is to see whether we are able to pass 
the stiffest test in building grass-roots organizations. This 
is a very important work which we must pay attention to and 
grasp firmly. In the near future, we should pay particular 
attention to checking "three trends," namely the trends of 
extravagance, withholding and extorting things from the people, 
and boastfulness, and maintain close relations between county 
and township cadres and the masses. Strenuous efforts should be 
made to promote the ideological work style of working hard, 
doing administrative work honestly and diligently, and seeking 
truth from facts. Our living expenses must not be divorced from 
local economic development and the actual living standards of 
the people. We must be good at doing hard work, using our 
brains, and solving difficult problems. In treating the common 
people, we must be fair in enforcing law and distributing 
interests and burdens to them. In handling problems, we must 
give the common people a just and rational explanation, tell 
them the results, and lay bare the problems, and must not 
practice fraud or try to whitewash ourselves.

  [Text] As of the end of April, the Nanjiang refined oil 
depot area which is a supporting project of the Nanjiang 
petrochemicals wharf of the Tianjin Port had been completed and 
equipped with the simple and easy oil handling conditions. 
  Sheng Huaren, general manager of the China Petrochemical 
Company, and Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal 
party committee, jointly went to the oil depot area in the 
Nanjiang Petrochemicals Wharf of Tianjin Port on 14 May to 
inspect this project and offered opinions for its perfect 
operation. 
  This refined oil depot area is built for handling refined 
oil 
on the sea, exporting light oil products, and developing 
Tianjin's petrochemical industry. The total storage capacity of 
this depot area is 100,000 cubic meters with a total investment 
of 120 million. At present, this project has been put into trial 
run and proved successful, and the installations are all in a 
normal state for handling refined oil. 
  While inspecting this project, Gao Dezhan pointed out: The 
petrochemical industry is a pillar industry of Tianjin and where 
the hopes of Tianjin's economic development lies. All relevant 
departments and enterprises should actively work for and 
contribute to developing petrochemical industry. The Nanjiang 
refined oil depot area is an important project. The 
construction of this project has a bearing on the development of 
Tianjin's petrochemical industry. It is necessary to grasp the 
rounding-off work of this project, step up efforts to build and 
improve rules, regulations, and systems, and exert particular 
efforts to strengthen safety and fire prevention as well as 
management in an effort to guarantee the normal operation of 
this project. 
  It is learned that this depot area will handle its first 
delivery of refined light oil in the near future.

  [Text] Tianjin, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Presidents from 
universities in 20 countries and regions and officials from the 
United Nations as well as from China are attending a four-day 
international conference on talents flow, which opened here 
today. 
  The problem of brain drain from the developing nations to 
the 
developed nations has drawn wide-range attention from the 
developing countries, and the meeting is expected to exchange 
views on that problem and to probe for solutions, said Wei Yu, 
vice-minister in charge of China's State Education Commission. 
  Talents flow along with greater regional economic 
cooperation 
and an open international market, Wei said at the meeting. 
  He said that from a long-term viewpoint, the shift of 
talented people helps promote cultural and technological 
exchange between different countries. 
  But developing nations often suffer from a brain drain that 
has negative effects on the local economy because often more 
talented people drift from the developing nations to the 
developed countries than in the reverse direction, he said. 
  "Talented people are a kind of wealth," he said. "The 
training of talented people costs a long term investment."

<F P=106> [By Reporter Hu Xiujuan (5170 4423 1227): "Heilongjiang's </F>
Individual and Private Economies Experience New Changes"] 
  [Text] A joint investigation group organized by the policy 
research office of the provincial party committee, the 
investigation and study office of the provincial government, the 
provincial planning commission, provincial industrial and 
commercial administration, and provincial federation of commerce 
and industry conducted a survey on the development of the 
individual and private economies in some prefectures and cities 
of Heilongjiang. The result showed that new changes had taken 
shape in the development of Heilongjiang's individual and 
private economies. 
  The number and the scale were continuously increasing and 
expanding. By the end of 1993, Heilongjiang's individual 
industrial and commercial household businesses had totaled 
517,500, and their registered funds 4.19 billion yuan, up 23.1 
and 61.8 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. In 
terms of the number of the individual industrial and commercial 
household businesses, Heilongjiang's ranking rose from 15th to 
13th in the country, and each household business had 6,304 yuan 
of funds in average, higher than the national average of 4,838 
yuan. The number of private enterprises totaled 3,595 in 
Heilongjiang, up 120 percent from the preceding year. In 1993, 
Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises paid 796 
million yuan of taxes and created 3.65 billion yuan in output 
value, up 35 and 62.2 percent, respectively, from 1992. People 
employed by individual enterprises have reached 810,000 so far. 
  Another change in Heilongjiang's individual and private 
economies was one from the unitary structure to diverse 
development. Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises 
used to have very unitary structure, with most them engaged in 
commerce and catering trade. The unitary structure has been 
changing since last year. First, the enterprises were developing 
toward the processing industry and the scientific and 
technological field. According to statistics, individual and 
private enterprises engaged in production and scientific and 
technological development totaled 180 last year. Second, 
individual household businesses increased by 30,955 in rural 
areas in 1993, up 29.7 percent from the preceding year. In 
Zhaozhou county alone, 1,696 individual enterprises were 
established last year, of which 84.2 percent were in rural 
areas. Third, a number of specialized villages emerged. 
According to statistics of Daqing city, over 100 specialized 
villages were established, which also achieved good economic 
efficiency. 
  Judging from the measures of management, Heilongjiang's 
individual industrial and commercial enterprises were marching 
toward cooperation and have created a situation of specialized 
production and operation. Heilongjiang's private enterprises 
also became dissatisfied with exclusively invested, joint, or 
limited liability companies. They were developing toward the 
direction of shareholding group companies and joint operation. 
In Harbin city alone, four private enterprise groups have been 
established. 
  The survey also showed improved quality in the people 
working 
at individual and private enterprises. A considerable number of 
them were technical personnel, retired personnel, personnel on 
leave without pay, and incumbent personnel moonlighting. Take 
Harbin for example. Over 50 percent of the personnel of private 
enterprises had a senior high school education level, of whom a 
large part had a college education level or higher.

  [Text] A few days ago, some localities in the province were 
hit by a disastrous cold spell. According to initial 
statistics, 2.7 million mu of land were affected, with over 71.2 
percent in need of replanting. 
  All localities across the province have taken actions to 
organize the masses to combat disasters and to provide for and 
help themselves by engaging in production. 
  From 16 to 18 May, all localities across the province 
generally experienced a severe drop in temperature. Most areas 
in Songnen Plain were hit by one of the worst cold spells in 
history. Of these areas, 25 counties and cities, including 
Anda, Qinggang, Wangkui, Lindian, Zhaozhou, Fuyu, Bayan, and 
Bixian, were hardest hit. Of the various kinds of affected crop 
seedlings, beet, [words indistinct], and corn suffered the most 
serious losses from the disaster, followed by soybean and wheat. 
  After the cold spell hit, leaders at all levels immediately 
travelled deep into the disaster-stricken areas to verify and 
investigate the situation and study ways to implement measures 
for combating disasters and saving lives. 
  The Anda city party committee and government held an 
on-the-spot office meeting in (Wenhua) Township which was 
seriously hit by the disaster on the morning of 18 May to help 
it combat disaster and limit damages, set up an anti-disaster 
and rescue leading group to rapidly implement anti-disaster and 
remedial measures and the responsibility system of making all 
departments help and support the disaster areas. At present, 
the chemical fertilizers, seeds, and diesel oil necessary for 
replanting are all ready and efforts are being made to clear the 
afflicted seedlings in order to conduct replanting. In line 
with the guidelines of the directives of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial government, the chairman of the 
provincial agricultural committee led the work group on 18-19 
May to successively go to seriously disaster-struck areas to 
assess the disastrous situation and help the grass-roots study 
anti-disaster measures and coordinate the supply of materials 
for combating disaster. With the approval of the agricultural 
committee, he also issued a [words indistinct] telegram to all 
localities on combating disaster, on providing their own relief, 
and on the current agricultural work, and put forward opinions 
and suggestions for the anti-disaster work.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lin Jianhua (2651 1696 5478): "Develop Party </F>
Schools' Role as `Fronts' and `Furnaces,' and Comprehensively 
Upgrade Cadres' Theoretical Quality"] 
  [Excerpt] The provincial party school work conference 
concluded on 12 May after a three-day session. 
  The conference discussed ways to conscientiously implement 
the national party school work conference with the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee and, based on Jilin's reality, ways to study and 
address the new issues on the current party school work, to 
thoroughly probe the new measures and new ideas for the reform 
and development of party school work, and to promote Jilin's 
party school work in a down-to-earth manner. 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
attended and gave an important speech at the conference. He 
said: Cadres at all levels should attach importance to and 
intensify study and take the initiative in arming their minds 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. China's reform, opening up, and socialist 
modernization are in a crucial period for major change. 
Correctly understanding the situation we are faced with, 
addressing the issues on the way of advancement in a timely and 
effective manner, and arming cadres with new concepts and new 
knowledge constitute the most important link. Leading cadres, 
in particular, cannot assume the important leadership task if 
they do not intensify study because "those in the dark are in no 
position to light the way for others." 
  In today's historical conditions, our intensive study, with 
the focus on new historical tasks, chiefly includes Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; theories on the socialist market economy and 
the knowledge on linkage to the world market economy; knowledge 
on modern science and technology; and the laws and regulations 
reflecting China's economic and political activities of the 
present stage, especially economic laws. 
  Party schools at all levels should conscientiously implement 
the theory of integrating theory with practice and fully develop 
their role as "fronts" and "furnaces." They should help cadres 
at all levels embrace the new ideas and concepts and the way of 
thinking needed in developing the socialist market economy; help 
cadres probe the new ideas for reform, opening up, and 
development of the socialist market economy; and help cadres 
uplift spirit and establish and maintain a good mind-set. 
  Party committees at all levels should strengthen leadership 
and regard the work to make party schools successful as an 
important link of strengthening party building. Strengthened 
leadership of party committees over party school work is an 
important guarantee to make party schools successful. Party 
committees' leadership over party school work chiefly consists 
of five aspects: timely relay of the guidelines of the important 
policy decisions and instructions of the party Central Committee 
and local party committees, guidance for party schools to 
understand and adhere to the correct orientation for running 
schools and educational principles, and steadfastness in taking 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as the basic guiding principle for running party 
schools; formulation of the plans for leading cadres at all 
levels and reserve cadres to undergo training at party schools 
and guidance for party schools to appraise and examine the 
performance of cadres during their study at party schools in 
line with the principle of combining training with use of cadres 
and the requirements on cadres in the new period; conscientious 
selection of cadres and establishment of rationally structured 
and united leading bodies which have good political quality, 
adhere to the party's basic line, have a high level of 
understanding of Marxist and Leninist theories, and know the 
work of party schools; and supervision and inspection of the 
work of party schools, timely study of and timely solutions to 
the major issues party schools encounter, participation in and 
guidance to party schools' research on some major theoretical 
and practical issues; and mobilizing party committees and 
governments to support party school work, adhere to the 
principle of "letting party committees run party schools," and 
invest willingly in gradually improving the teaching conditions 
of party schools. 
  In conclusion, He Zhukang hoped that comrades of party 
committees and party schools would seize the opportunity, uplift 
the spirit, hold the heavy tasks entrusted by this era, and 
raise the education of party schools to a new level. [passage

  [Text] Changchun, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The population growth 
rate has dropped in north-east China's Jilin Province over the 
past few years, thanks to family planning and development of the 
rural economy. 
  According to a local birth control official, the natural 
growth rate has now dropped to 8.9 per thousand, from 12.93 per 
thousand in 1990, with a negative growth in some areas. 
  The official said that since the 1970s, the number of women 
in the province of child-bearing age has averaged 300,000 per 
year, and birth-control workers have provided them with various 
birth control services. 
  They have also helped families to become more prosperous. 
The provincial family planning departments have provided 50,000 
items of farm technology and given priority in government loans 
to families with only one child. 
  A system of family planning insurance has been set up in 
some 
counties.

  [Text] The provincial industrial and commercial 
administration, provincial grain department, provincial trade 
department, provincial supply and marketing cooperative, 
provincial public health department, and provincial 
technological supervision bureau recently issued a joint 
circular to urge all localities to strengthen management of 
edible salt markets and resolutely prevent uniodized salt from 
entering iodine deficient areas so as to ensure people's 
physical and mental health and consolidate and improve the 
achievements in preventing and treating the diseases resulting 
from lack of iodine. 
  The circular calls for continued efforts to implement the 
"methods of Jilin Province for management of the salt industry." 
Salt administrative bureaus at all levels are administrative 
departments for salt industry to take charge of the unified 
distribution of the salt used for various purposes. No units or 
individuals are permitted to engage in the production, retail 
sales, or wholesales of salt without approval. We should ensure 
the quality, supply, and marketing of iodized salt. The units 
and individuals who sell and supply substandard iodized salt, 
uniodized salt, and low-quality salt to disease areas or 
breweries and livestock breeders will be sternly dealt with 
according to law in the same way as we deal with sellers of fake 
medicines. Wholesales of marketable salt are managed by salt 
industry companies at all levels in a unified manner, and a 
business license is needed. The provincial salt administrative 
bureau will verify and issue "permission for salt business" to 
Jilin's salt wholesales units before 31 May, which should than 
register with local industrial and commercial administrations 
and obtain new business licenses. State-owned (collective) 
grain enterprises, commercial units, and supply and marketing 
cooperatives engaged in the retail sales of edible salt (iodized 
salt) should purchase from designated salt whole sellers, and 
they are not permitted to purchase from unlicensed units. 
Individual industrial and commercial households which sell 
edible salt (iodized salt) on a commission basis should hold the 
"permission for retail sales of edible salt by individual 
industrial and commercial households" issued by salt industry 
administrative departments at and above the county level. 
Industrial and commercial administrations, salt administrative 
departments, public health departments, and technological 
supervision departments should work in close coordination to 
strictly deal with the units and individuals who violate the 
laws, regulations, and circulars on the salt industry.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Wei (1728 5633): "Summon Up Our Courage, </F>
Fortify Our Confidence, Check the Slide, and Halt Deficits"] 
  [Excerpts] On the morning of 9 May, the provincial meeting 
on halting deficits and increasing profits was held at Liaoning 
People's Theater in Shenyang. The meeting summarized the 1993 
work in halting deficits and increasing profits, analyzed the 
present situation in industry, and called for efforts to 
mobilize all the people in the province to summon up their 
courage, seek unity of thinking, fortify their confidence, and 
try every possible means to check the slowdown in the tempo of 
production and the increase in deficits among the state-owned 
industrial enterprises of the province. 
  At the meeting, Xu De, secretary general of the provincial 
government read out the provincial government's decision on 
commending the localities and enterprises who were exceptional 
in halting deficits and increasing profits and on criticizing 
the four enterprises that each incurred over 10 million yuan in 
deficits. Cong Zhenglong, vice governor of the province, 
attended the meeting and gave a speech. At the meeting, mayors 
of various cities signed certificates of responsibility for 
halting deficits. 
  In 1993, the province achieved some results in halting 
deficits and increasing profits, and the industrial economy 
maintained a trend of relatively rapid progress. According to 
the statistics compiled among the province's budgetary 
state-owned industrial enterprises, last year, 464 enterprises 
in the province were operated at a loss, accounting for 26.04 
percent of the total, 5.26 percentage points lower than that in 
1992, if calculated in terms of the comparable standards not 
covered by the general rule on financial affairs of enterprises 
and the standards for enterprise accounting. Meanwhile, the 
volume of deficits of such enterprises was 800 million yuan, 250 
million yuan fewer than the deficits incurred in 1992, with the 
margin of decrease in deficits reaching 23.52 percent. As a 
result, the province fulfilled the task of decreasing the range 
of deficits by 5 percent and the volume of deficits by 15 
percent, that was assigned to the province by the state at the 
beginning of 1993. 
  Since the beginning of 1994, the province's industrial 
economy has kept on the trend of relatively rapid progress. By 
the end of April, the province as a whole realized 99.666 
billion yuan in the gross value of industrial output, an 
increase of 31.2 percent over the same period last year, and 
realized 57.533 billion yuan in sales value, an increase of 9.4 
percent. However, during this period, the province's 
state-owned industrial enterprises fell into an extremely grim 
situation, showing signs of slow growth, poor efficiency, 
increasingly serious deficits, and a soaring range and volume of 
deficits. According to the statistics complied in the first 
quarter among the province's budgetary state-owned industrial 
enterprises, 1,123 enterprises were operating at a loss, 271 
more than the figure at the same period last year; the range of 
deficits was as high as 67.57 percent, 17.13 percentage points 
higher than the same period last year; and the volume of 
deficits was 903 million yuan, 524 million yuan more than the 
deficits incurred at the same period last year, with the margin 
of increased deficits reaching 138 percent. At the same time, 
all of the 14 cities in the province and all of the 10 trades 
that are under key examination experienced increases in deficits 
at varying degrees and 25 enterprises incurred over 5 million 
yuan in deficits each, 17 more than the figure of the same 
period, last year. 
  Vice Governor Cong Zhenglong said in his speech: At present, 
the deficits incurred by state-owned industrial enterprises has 
become the most conspicuous problem hampering economic 
development and affecting the social stability of the province. 
All localities, all departments, and all enterprises must list 
the work of halting deficits and increasing profits as a major 
item on their daily agenda and must adopt effective measures and 
try every possible means to halt deficits and increase profits. 
In line with the guidelines of the executive meeting of the 
provincial government, Cong Zhenglong set the following demands 
on how to halt deficits and increase profits. 
  We should summon up our courage, seek unity of thinking, and 
take a more urgent attitude in halting deficits and increasing 
profits. The second quarter of this year is the key period of 
halting deficits and increasing profits. Whether we can reduce 
the range of deficits to 50 percent or lower in the second 
quarter of this year is critical to fulfilling the target of 
reducing the annual range of deficits by 5 percentage points and 
reducing the annual volume of deficits by 10 percent. [passage 
omitted] 
  We should energetically push forward the reform of property 
right system and operational methods of enterprises and 
accelerate the change of operational mechanism of the 
enterprises operating at a lose. [passage omitted] 
  We should strengthen the system of assuming responsibility 
for attaining the target of halting deficits and increasing 
profits and establish a system under which each level assumes 
responsibility for the work of the next lower level. [passage 
omitted] 
  We should further strengthen leadership over the work of 
halting deficits and increasing profits and better construct 
leading bodies for enterprises operating at a loss. [passage 
omitted] 
  In conclusion, Cong Zhenglong stressed that this year's 
endeavor of halting deficits and increasing profits should be 
focused on Shenyang, Dandong, Jinzhou, Fuxin, and Tieling whose 
range of deficits has been higher than the average provincial 
level by 10 percentage points and whose volume of deficits has 
surpassed 180 million yuan each; on enterprises of the textile, 
light, chemical industries whose range of deficits exceeds the 
the province's average level and whose volume of deficits 
surpasses 200 million yuan each; and on enterprises that have 
incurred more than 5 million yuan each. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Shenyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Overall labor reform 
has been completed by 9,200 enterprises in the northeast China 
province of Liaoning. 
  A total of 2.11 million workers in state-run enterprises 
have 
been put under a new contract labor system, ending years of 
"jobs for life". 
  This provincial capital cut 90,000 surplus workers from 
state-run enterprises last year. 
  Meanwhile, the port city of Dalian has streamlined its 800 
state enterprises to the tune of 32 percent, including 4,000 
officials. 
  All these changes have been taking place smoothly. 
  In accordance with the labor system reform, a distribution 
system reform is also under way. First-line workers and 
technical specialists now receive relatively high wages. 
  To safeguard the reform, the province has taken a big step 
forward in building a social security system, which covers most 
of the province's enterprises and workers.

  [Text] People's courts of Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, 
Jinzhou, Chaoyang, and Dandong cities respectively held open 
trials a few days ago to pronounce judgment according to law to 
a number of felony criminal cases, including murder, robbery, 
rape, stealing, and arson cases, and more than 100 criminals 
were declared guilty. Of them, a number of criminals sentenced 
to death were executed by shooting with the approval and ruling 
of the provincial higher people's court. 
  Of these cases, most were aimed at illegally occupying 
public 
and private property. Some criminals made a reckless move and 
defied the law for money and property, thus seriously 
endangering the society. Of the five criminals sentenced to 
death by the Dalian city intermediate people's court, four were 
guilty of robbing and killing a taxi driver. In league with Li 
Chaogang (male, 21 years old), Li Wei (male, 19 years old), and 
Yan Jingxin (male, 18 years old), Ding Yu (male, 21 years old) 
fled to Dalian on 18 January this year after committed the crime 
in Changchun city. Being planned beforehand, these four 
criminals cheated the taxi driven by Cui Wenyan to Changsheng 
Street in Shahekou District in the name of renting the taxi. 
Ding Yu stabbed the victim directly on his neck with a dagger, 
and Li Wei and two other criminals stabbed him with daggers in 
his chest and back for more than 40 times, thus stabbing him to 
death. Then, these four criminals robbed some 200 yuan in cash. 
The Dalian city intermediate people's court sentenced Ding Yu, 
Li Chaogang, and Li Wei to death and deprived them of lifelong 
political rights. At the same time, Yan Jingxin was condemned 
to death with the sentence suspended for two years and was 
deprived of his lifelong political rights. With the 
verification and approval of the provincial higher people's 
court, Ding Yu, Li Chaogang, and Li Wei were executed by 
shooting.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Weng Hsu-yuan (5040 0650 0954): "Lu Ping </F>
Speaks on Financial Arrangements for New Hong Kong Airport, 
Hopes Chris Patten Can Leave Hong Kong by Chek Lap Kok Airport"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 May--Lu Ping, director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said here today: 
We hope to resolve the issue of the new airport's financial 
arrangements as quickly as possible and then discuss outstanding 
issues in the Airport Corporation Bill. He added: The Chinese 
side hopes that the new airport can be completed by 1 July 1997 
so that Chris Patten can return to London by plane from the new 
Chek Lap Kok airport at Lantau. 
  When meeting with the 60-plus representatives of the alumni 
association of Hong Kong's Pui Kiu Middle School at Diaoyutai 
State Guesthouse today, Lu said: The Airport Committee meeting 
was held a few days ago. The Chinese side hopes that the 
financial arrangements for the new airport can be settled at an 
early date. Lu pointed out: "We have repeatedly made clear that 
the new airport will belong to the special administrative region 
[SAR] government after 1997, that the central government will 
never take any money from Hong Kong, that the SAR does not have 
to hand over any taxes to the central government, and that it is 
completely independent financially." Lu stressed: In arguing 
with the British side, the Chinese side is arguing for the Hong 
Kong people. The increase in the SAR's financial reserves from 
HK$5 billion [Hong Kong dollars] at the start of the 
Sino-British talks to HK$25 billion is the result of the Chinese 
Government's haggling with the British side. This is in addition 
to the Land Fund, which is estimated to be HK$100 billion by 
1997. Beijing has thus created a fairly good condition for the 
future SAR government and laid a fairly solid financial 
foundation. Therefore, if the airport's debts far exceed the 
financial reserves left for the SAR government, is it not the 
case that the SAR government will get nothing in the future? 
How can it get along then? Lu said this was not a numbers ploy. 
  Lu said: We hope to resolve the airport financial 
arrangements at an early date and then discuss the draft 
regulations for the Airport Corporation. There are a lot of 
issues, such as who will administer the airport and how? 
According to the provisions of the memorandum, the airport will 
be administered by the Airport Authority which, as a legal 
person, has independent management rights. But this right must 
be subject to certain checks. It should not be outside the 
supervision of the SAR government, which must be responsible to 
the Hong Kong taxpayers. 
  Lu said: After 1997, the Hong Kong people will run Hong 
Kong. The work of the Preliminary Work Committee [PWC] and the 
Preparatory Committee is all aimed at the joint participation of 
Hong Kong people. They provide assistance to Hong Kong people 
to realize the future administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong 
people. He said: Deng Xiaoping has said to us on several 
occasions that it is absolutely necessary to believe that Hong 
Kong people can run Hong Kong well. 
  At the meeting, some people raised the question of high 
property prices in Hong Kong. Lu replied: The PWC economic 
sub-group is discussing this issue. It should be resolved 
properly but it should not lead to a slump in property prices. 
If a large quantity of land is supplied now, many buildings 
will just be completed in 1997 and this will affect the SAR 
government. Before 1997 this issue is handled by the British 
Hong Kong Government. Lu said: The Chinese Government hopes to 
avoid great fluctuations in property prices in Hong Kong before 
1997. It is hoped the issue can be solved properly so that the 
people's livelihood and Hong Kong's status as an international 
financial center will not be affected by high property prices 
and that the SAR government will not be greatly affected. 
  As for the transition of civil servants, Lu reaffirmed that 
the PWC did not ask civil servants to make known their 
positions. The Basic Law has stipulated the transition of civil 
servants. With the exception of 20 or so senior officials who 
should be nominated by the SAR chief executive and appointed by 
the central government, other civil servants may continue to 
serve the SAR government. Lu said: The British Hong Kong 
Government wants to select the principal officials of the future 
SAR government before 1997. This is impossible because this is 
tantamount to selecting principal officials in place of the SAR 
chief executive and violates the principle of Hong Kong people's 
autonomy. 
  At the meeting, some members who are indigenous residents of 
the New Territories raised the question of the amendment to the 
New Territories Land (Exemption) Bill. According to a Hong Kong 
Government official, after comprehensive amendment, the bill 
does not violate the Basic Law. Lu said that it is necessary to 
read this bill clearly. If the amended bill approved by the 
Legislative Council contradicts the Basic Law, it will be 
proclaimed null and void after 1997. 
  Lu said: The Chinese side is still striving to cooperate 
with the British side but what is more important is to focus our 
attention on the Hong Kong people. If there is no cooperation, 
work in the transition period will be more difficult, but the 
Chinese side is confident a stable transition can be achieved by 
relying on Hong Kong people. 
  Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese 
Affairs Office, who attended the meeting with Lu Ping, spoke 
highly of the contributions made by the Pui Kiu Middle School in 
training talented people for Hong Kong. The visiting delegation 
of overseas alumni of Pui Kiu Middle School is headed by Chang 
Hua-feng and Ling Wen-cheng.

<F P=106> [By Fan Chun (5400 0689): "The 15 Uncertain Elements About </F>
Hong Kong That Communist China Is Deeply Nervous About"] 
  [Text] There is still more than three years for 
Communist China to "decide" on how to take back Hong Kong. But 
already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces" in 
Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish the "right to 
hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a 
crack down on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands. 
<H5>  Red-Headlined Documents and Qian Qichen's Instructions </H5>
  On 1 July 1997, a day which marks the 76th anniversary of 
the 
founding of the CPC, Communist China will restore its 
sovereignty over Hong Kong. As this day approaches, when there 
will be a change of "national flags," some people are proud and 
feel avenged, some feel helpless, and of course there are some 
who feel it is the end of the world.... But whatever the 
attitude toward the return of Hong Kong in 1997, most agree that 
day will not be a happy or bright one. 
  "What kind of problems will there be during the transfer of 
sovereignty?" Like a large unwelcome cloud, this question looms 
above the high levels of the CPC as an increasing worry. A 
report relayed in early April by the State Council's General 
Office, "On problems that may appear during Hong Kong's 
transition, the transfer of sovereignty, and the early days of 
the Special Administrative Region [SAR] government," drafted by 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and the Hong Kong and 
Macao Affairs Research Office, highlighted this worry. 
  The report was issued as a red-headlined document to the 
party committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, 
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and party committees of 
the relevant military regions, obviously to get the whole party 
and Army mentally prepared. From what Qian Qichen, State 
Council vice premier and director of the Preliminary Work 
Committee, wrote on the document, we can see that without the 
cooperation of British Hong Kong, Communist China's hands are 
tied in the latter phase of Hong Kong's transition. Qian Qichen 
said in his remarks: We must fully assess changes in the Hong 
Kong situation, be fully prepared, and properly handle and solve 
problems and be ready with solutions to them in order to 
maintain Hong Kong's long-term stability. 
  Under its requirement for "full assessment" and "full 
preparation," the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office report 
listed 15 possible serious problems that may occur during Hong 
Kong's transition, its transfer of sovereignty, and the early 
days of the SAR government. These problems are excerpted as 
follows: 
<H5>  "British Hong Kong Pushes Executive Council to the Forefront </H5>
of Confrontation With the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office" 
  1. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to 
agitate and sow dissension among high-ranking civil servants. 
  2. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to 
pick, promote, and groom a group of pro-British and anti-Chinese 
elements and install them in the Hong Kong Government and elite 
positions in professional circles. 
  3. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities appoint 
pro-British and anti-Chinese elements to the Executive Council 
and push it to the forefront of confrontation with the Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office. 
  4. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to 
rely on U.S. influence and internationalize the Hong Kong 
problem. 
  5. To win over public opinion, Britain and the British Hong 
Kong authorities institute a social welfare system like those 
pursued in northern Europe which puts an excessive burden on the 
SAR government. 
<H5>  Reference to Trump Card Held by British Hong Kong That Could </H5>
Throw Hong Kong Into Chaos 
  6. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and 
make use of Hong Kong's anti-Chinese and extreme rightist forces 
and hostile forces overseas to turn Hong Kong into a virtually 
semi-independent polity or political entity. 
  7. Britain, together with the United States, Japan, and 
their western allies, withdraw all of their capital from Hong 
Kong, paralyzing its finances. 
  8. British capital, led by the Hong Kong and Shanghai 
Banking Corporation and Chartered Bank [Standard Chartered Bank] 
abruptly announce the end of their domicile in Hong Kong, 
causing great confusion in Hong Kong. 
  9. Britain and the United States grant passports to 
anti-Chinese political figures in Hong Kong in support of their 
activities to oppose China and create chaos in Hong Kong to keep 
it in turmoil. 
  10. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities abet and 
support anti-Chinese political forces in Hong Kong in collusion 
with Taiwan's anti-communist forces and "Taiwan Independence" 
forces to pursue activities opposing China and creating chaos in 
Hong Kong. 
  Reference to Possibility That British Hong Kong 
Would Deprive SAR Government of Functioning Government 
Bureaucracy 
  11. Abetted and controlled by Britain and the British Hong 
Kong authorities, a large number of civil servants resign or 
retire early in order to deprive the SAR government of a 
functioning government bureaucracy. 
  12. Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities 
manufacture political incidents. Such incidents will be fronted 
by anti-Chinese hostile forces, which will encourage Hong Kong 
citizens to go on strike and close up shop so that there is 
turmoil during the transfer of political power. 
  13. Britain supports or plans for hostile forces in Hong 
Kong to engineer violence and conduct assassinations and 
sabotage with a view to creating chaos in Hong Kong during the 
transfer of sovereignty, causing foreign capital to leave and 
the industrial and commercial sectors to divert their funds. 
  14. During the transition, Britain and the British Hong Kong 
authorities use their executive and judicial prerogatives to 
purge, persecute, or threaten patriotic and Hong Kong-loving 
industrialists and businessmen, middle and high-ranking civil 
servants, and former or incumbent legislative and executive 
councillors who do not agree with Britain's violation of the 
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements between the 
two countries. 
  15. During the transition and the transfer of sovereignty, 
Britain and the British Hong Kong authorities continue to 
monopolize Hong Kong's finances and rob it of its money under 
the cover of construction projects, franchises, and contract 
awards to maintain Britain's economic and financial privileges 
in Hong Kong for a long time after its withdrawal. 
<H5>  Hong Kong Policy Doubted and Questioned by the Military </H5>
  It is surprising that the scenarios "conceived" by the 
report 
about Hong Kong's prospects are so horrific and apocalyptic. 
Communist China has always said that it has the ability to 
maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. However, after 
Zhongnanhai has played all of its trump cards, the initiative is 
now in the hands of British Hong Kong. The report stressed 
specifically that some of the 15 scenarios had occurred during 
the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, some are 
continuing, some are being planned, and some are very likely to 
occur during the transfer of political power. For Communist 
China, a "small move" by the other side would be enough to dim 
the luster of the pearl of the Orient. 
  The Hong Kong policy has been severely challenged within the 
CPC. At first, Communist China adopted a "high-handed" approach, 
as if once Chris Patten tabled his political reform package to 
the Legislative Council, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] 
would immediately "liberate" Hong Kong. However, when Chris 
Patten's package was tabled to the council, Communist China 
could not move further.... To deal with inner-party 
dissatisfaction, especially within the Army, during this 
two-year period, Qian Qichen attended sessions at the invitation 
of the PLA deputy group to answer questions. The question put 
by the PLA deputy group was very candid: "What specific 
measures does our government's have given Britain's 
confrontational and noncooperative stance?" 
<H5>  Qian Qichen Puts Forward Five Options for Taking Back Hong </H5>
Kong 
  Qian Qichen was very clever in fielding the question. Unlike 
previous times when he gave clear-cut answers, he put forward 
five options, without saying who had the right to decide on 
which option or providing the basis of the options. 
  Qian Qichen's five options were: 
  1. Before 1997 or in early 1995, form a SAR government 
according to the Basic Law and begin work on the changeover -- 
this is an option for reduced disruption and confrontation with 
Britain. 
  2. If the situation changes, the schedule must be advanced 
to have a basic framework for the SAR government in place by 
mid-1996, and by then preparations for the SAR should be coming 
to an end. 
  3. If the present situation continues and Britain persists 
in undermining the Sino-British Joint Declaration and negating 
the agreements between the two governments, the Chinese 
Government will, at the right time, inform the British 
Government of the end of its rule in Hong Kong. 
  4. In case of violent political turmoil and prolonged 
political strife during the transition or the appearance of an 
"international political city," "political entity," or 
"semi-independence" masterminded by British Hong Kong, take 
action to recover Hong Kong immediately. 
  5. The National People's Congress Standing Committee has the 
right to order or authorize necessary measures. 
<H5>  Begin Drafting the "Right To Hold Perpetrators Accountable </H5>
for Past Acts" To Deal With Hong Kong Dissidents 
  There is still more than three years for Communist China to 
"decide" on a way to take back Hong Kong. There is still time. 
But already there are signs that to deal with "hostile forces" 
in Hong Kong, Communist China is going to establish a "right to 
hold perpetrators accountable for past acts" to "justify" a 
crackdown on dissidents when sovereignty is safely in its hands. 
  At a seminar held at the Jingxi Guesthouse on 26 March, 
which 
was attended by persons-in-charge of the military, armed police, 
public security, and the militias, the public security and 
military suggested applying the right to hold perpetrators 
accountable for their past acts in Hong Kong and Macao. There 
would be three "retroactive periods:" 
  1. The period after the signing of the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration; 
  2. After the promulgation of the Hong Kong SAR Basic Law; 
  3. After Britain unilaterally stopped cooperating in the 
transition, forcing China to publicize diplomatic documents. 
  Xu Huizi [Central Committee member and deputy chief of PLA 
General Staff] stressed specifically that the PLA supported and 
assisted public security and the armed police in maintaining 
public order in the country and cracking down on hostile forces 
and elements, including hostile forces and elements based in the 
Chinese territory of Hong Kong and Macao and aimed at 
overthrowing the Central People's government and the CPC-led 
socialist system. 
  This is an alarming move. No wonder some mainland people are 
discussing this matter, saying that the first thing Communist 
China will do after recovering Hong Kong is to crack down on 
counterrevolutionaries! 
  Will the tragic "Movement To Suppress 
Counterrevolutionaries" 
in the mainland of those years be replayed in Hong Kong?

<F P=106> [By political editor Chip Tsao and Rain Ren] </F>
  [Text] China's advisers are keen to adopt archaic and 
draconian Hong Kong treason and sedition laws after 1997, a move 
that has alarmed the Hong Kong government and some legislators. 
  Some of the laws, which carry long prison sentences, were 
drafted early in the century. 
  Article Nine of Chapter 200 of the Laws of Hong Kong states 
clearly that a seditious intention is an intention: 
  1) To bring into hatred or contempt or to excite 
disaffection 
against the administration of justice in Hong Kong. 
  2) To raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty's 
subjects or inhabitants of Hong Kong. 
  3) To promote feelings of ill will and enmity between 
different classes of the population of Hong Kong. 
  Article 14 of Chapter 200 says the police have the power to 
"break open any outer or inner door of any premises or place" 
and to "remove or obliterate any seditious publication". 
  The laws have not been enforced by the Hong Kong government 
for decades. 
  Preliminary Working Committee [PWC] leaders, now meeting in 
Beijing, say the laws could apply in Hong Kong as long as some 
colonial terms like "Her Majesty" are replaced with "the central 
government". 
  It is understood that the PWC's advice to Beijing to retain 
these laws after 1997 has alarmed the Hong Kong government, 
which is looking at various options on how to localise the laws 
before the hand-over. 
  A government official said the laws were extremely sensitive 
and the problem had to be tackled. 
  He pointed out Singapore and Malaysia's internal security 
acts as examples of similar laws left behind by British 
administrations which could be used as a means to restrict civic 
freedom. 
  The legislator Christine Loh said the Hong Kong laws would 
have to be reformed and clarified in order to fulfill Article 23 
of the Basic Law. 
  "Laws of treason and sedition are complex, not clear, 
difficult to interpret and referring to old cases," Loh said. 
  "Many lawyers have said they don't like the notion of loose 
interpretation of 'seditious intention'. 
  "Hong Kong will need tighter legal drafting terms to narrow 
their definitions." 
  Loh said that unless there was an independent judiciary and 
a 
independent prosecution in Hong Kong after 1997, such laws could 
be abused. 
  "One would hope that after 1997 the SAR [Special 
Administrative Region] government would continue to take a 
relaxed approach," Loh said. 
  "The Basic Law has been finalised since 1990. 
  "One would have hoped the Government could have done more 
reform before now. 
  "Whether it is sensitive or not it still has to be done." 
  Loh urged the Government to reform these laws as soon as 
possible, preferably before July 1995 within the current 
legislature. 
  Liu Yiu-chu, a Hong Kong delegate to the National People's 
Congress (NPC), said if the term "Her Majesty" in these laws was 
replaced with the term "Chinese central government", Hong Kong's 
freedom of the press would be extremely vulnerable. 
  Liu said the British legal system allowed people to 
challenge 
any government. 
  "It would not be seen as seditious. This concept of sedition 
is entirely different from that defined by the mainland," Liu 
said. She urged the PWC to study this more closely. 
  Berry Hsu, a law lecturer at the Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology, said the PWC attitude was fair. 
  "What is the alternative?" Hsu asked. 
  "If you do not want the seditious and treason laws to be 
maintained, you may leave the Chinese government with no options 
but to apply national law. "That is even worse." 
  He said the way to minimise the prospect of abusing these 
laws was to uphold a completely independent judiciary.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Change Our Laws Before It Is Too Late"] </F>
  [Text] Someone stands in Victoria Park urging people to 
protest about the Hong Kong Government's ability to jail -- 
indefinitely -- illegal immigrants who are needed as witnesses. 
  Another writes a letter to a newspaper criticising the Hong 
Kong legal system for sentencing a man to six years for a 
relatively minor burglary and sending another, who left his 
assault victim permanently disabled, to a training school. 
  A third, who lives in a public housing estate, demonstrates 
outside a fancy block of flats and berates wealthy residents for 
living in the lap of luxury, while the working classes are 
forced to exist in shoe-boxes. 
  What do these three people have in common? They could, in 
theory, be charged with sedition. Ridiculous, you say. In 
theory, yes. 
  But the laws of Hong Kong state clearly that a seditious 
intention is an intention: 
  1) To bring into hatred or contempt or to excite 
disaffection 
against the administration of justice in Hong Kong. 
  2) To raise discontent or disaffection among Her Majesty's 
subjects or inhabitants of Hong Kong. 
  3) To promote feelings of ill will and enmity between 
different classes of the population of Hong Kong. 
  These offences are, in theory, punishable by a long prison 
sentence. Of course, they are anachronisms which have been 
lying untouched on the statute books for years. No one in the 
present administration has ever given the slightest thought to 
using them against the Hong Kong public. 
  But 1997 is looming and with it comes a host of 
uncertainties 
and unanswered questions. Among them is what will happen to 
some of these laws? 
  It is a good question and one to which no one seems to have 
an answer now. 
  Hong Kong law must be localised before 1997. It is a huge 
task and the Government has not consulted China on some areas of 
the law. Indeed, Hong Kong officials are still discussing what 
to do among themselves. 
  There appear to be at least three options: rewrite the 
legislation; talk to China about it through the Joint Liaison 
Group (JLG); or do nothing and leave any changes to the Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) government. 
  While the Government ponders what to do, it seems that 
members of the Preliminary Working Committee -- the 
Beijing-appointed advisers -- are taking a very keen interest in 
some of these laws. 
  It does not take a great leap of imagination to believe that 
many of the old laws have a certain appeal to some people in 
Beijing. 
  A few minor changes -- substitute Her Majesty for something 
to do with the central government -- and you are in business. 
You have some ready-made laws that are so vague, so open to 
interpretation, that they could be used against anyone for doing 
anything at any time. 
  According to the Basic Law, the SAR government should enact 
laws to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition and 
subversion against the central government and theft of state 
secrets. Legislators in Hong Kong are concerned that Beijing 
will impose its own legislation if the laws are not changed by 
1997. 
  Most people in Hong Kong will agree that it will be highly 
inadvisable to leave many of these relics from another age on 
the statute books. 
  For example, there are some clauses in the laws of Hong Kong 
that will send shivers down the spine of anyone who has an 
interest in the freedom of the press. 
  Under the "Power to remove seditious publications" any 
police 
officer or public officer may: a) enter any premises or place; 
b) stop and board any vehicle, tram-car, train or vessel and 
remove therefrom or obliterate any seditious publication. 
  There are other examples and, as Martin Lee has said: "In 
Hong Kong, we assume that the rule of law means laws that 
protect our rights, freedoms and way of life. But when the laws 
themselves are bad, our freedoms are in great danger. 
  "Thus far, the anachronistic laws restricting press freedom 
have not been widely abused because of the link to the UK's 
parliamentary democracy ... if the Hong Kong Government were to 
behave irresponsibly, heads would conceivably roll in Whitehall. 
But even this system of accountability ... will be removed on 
June 30, 1997." 
  The Hong Kong Government has acted on some laws and amended 
some ordinances. But it has been pointed out that Britain has 
left some draconian laws on the statute books in other Asian 
colonies, such as the Singapore Internal Security Act and a 
similar law in Malaysia. 
  There is not a great deal of time left. Hong Kong should 
identify all the problem areas. For example, the meaning of the 
word subversion needs to be clearly defined, and then invite 
China to discuss them through the JLG. [sentence as published] 
  If an acceptable new version of the laws can be agreed on by 
both sides then so much the better. It will be an encouraging 
sign that they can come to a sensible decision about a very 
important matter. 
  If no such agreement can be reached then the Hong Kong 
Government must take a deep breath and come up with its own 
solution. It is impossible for some of these laws to remain on 
the books. 
  They must be updated, improved and made relevant to modern 
Hong Kong society. 
  Whatever the solution, the people charged with the 
responsibility had better get a move on. 
  Time is running out.

<F P=106> [By S.Y. Yue] </F>
  [Text] The Legal Department has taken a major move in 
anticipation of future Basic Law requirements by appointing two 
local candidates as law officers who rank just below the 
Attorney-General. 
  Daniel Fung, at 41 one of the youngest QCs in Hong Kong, 
will 
become Solicitor-General. Criminal lawyer Peter Nguyen will be 
Director of Public Prosecutions. 
  They will be the first local Chinese to occupy the posts. 
The appointments pave the way for a local Attorney-General. 
  Under the Basic Law, the Attorney-General should be a local 
Chinese with no right of abode in any foreign country. 
  The present incumbent, Jeremy Mathews, and the five law 
officers below him are expatriates. 
  Both Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen have been given three-year 
contracts. Mr Fung will assume the post--vacant since the 
departure of Bertrand de Speville to become ICAC [Independent 
Commission Against Corruption] Commissioner in February last 
year--in December and will serve beyond the change of 
sovereignty in 1997. 
  Mr Nguyen, 51, will succeed retiring Director of Public 
Prosecutions John Wood in two months and will serve until July 
14 1997. 
  Yesterday, both expressed the wish to stay on to work for 
the 
future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. 
  Mr Fung said he would renounce his British passport, which 
he 
obtained through studying in Britain. 
  "It would not be a difficult choice for me to renounce the 
British passport and to have a SAR passport," he said. 
  Mr Nguyen, Chinese by nationality, was born in Vietnam. He 
holds a British Dependent Territory Citizen's passport. 
  Traditionally, the Solicitor-General is regarded as the 
shadow attorney-general and the front-runner for the job. But 
Mr Fung said yesterday: "Since the post is occupied, there is 
no room for me to speculate on that." 
  Although Mr Fung took donations to students staging a hunger 
strike in Tiananmen Square during the pro-democracy movement in 
1989, he did not think that would affect his career in the Legal 
Department after 1997. 
  "I personally do not think it would have any effect because 
most Hong Kong people supported the democracy movement at that 
time." He said he took about $100,000 to students in Beijing in 
an individual capacity and had not been a member of any of the 
pro-democracy groups. 
  Joining the Legal Department will mean a drastic cut in 
salary for Mr Fung and Mr Nguyen, but both said financial gains 
did not rank first in their decision. 
  The appointment also means a breakthrough in the pace of 
localisation in the Legal Department. 
  The slow pace has attracted much criticism and Governor 
Chris 
Patten promised in his policy address last year that three of 
the top five law officers would be local by 1995. 
  "The policy of localisation which was implemented some years 
back has run into difficulties, but the recent appointment--that 
is mine and Mr Nguyen's--is an indication that the logjam has 
been broken," Mr Fung said. 
  With the new appointments, 28.8 percent of the department's 
directorate are locals. The overall localisation rate of the 
department is 54 percent.

<F P=106> [By Michael Smith and M.Y. Sung in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] The Hong Kong Government will take a hardline 
stance on Chinese dissidents wanting to visit the territory next 
month. 
  It's a bid to fend off China's fears the territory will be 
used as a base for "subversive" activity during the anniversary 
of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
  The government, it is believed, will reject visa 
applications 
from a growing number of prominent Chinese political activists 
preparing to gather here for the fifth anniversary of the June 4 
crackdown. The move is designed to block any row with China. 
  Sources close to the Beijing government told the Hong Kong 
Standard that a planned visit by dissident leader Wuer Kaixi at 
about the time of the Tiananmen anniversary would be regarded as 
confrontational. 
  A government spokesman said yesterday that no application 
had 
yet been received from dissidents wanting to visit the territory 
but several dissidents, including Wuer Kaixi, the leader of the 
Tiananmen Square movement, have already announced publicly their 
intention to come here. 
  Another prominent dissident, Chai Ling, is also believed to 
be planning a visit for the June 4 anniversary. 
  The Hong Kong Government believes the visits are part of an 
orchestrated move by Chinese dissidents, a move which would not 
be welcomed by local authorities. 
  The government is likely to use its powers to reject visa 
applications to abide by the one country, two systems policy and 
avoid becoming involved in China's internal affairs. 
  A Chinese official said any approval by the Hong Kong 
authorities for Wuer Kaixi to visit the territory would be seen 
as a provocation and would threaten already tense relations with 
Beijing. 
  The source said it was of great concern to China that Hong 
Kong does not become a base of subversion against the communist 
regime. 
  "His visit will not benefit Hong Kong. On the contrary, his 
relation to the territory will jeopardise Hong Kong's stability 
and prosperity," he said. 
  "The purpose of (Wuer Kaixi's) visit is considered to be 
provocative in Chinese eyes," the source said. 
  Wuer Kaixi, who is still on China's most-wanted list, has 
been living in exile in the U.S. since the 1989 crackdown. He 
was reported to have escaped from China and fled to the U.S. via 
Hong Kong and is now a student in San Francisco.

  [Text] Exiled unionist Han Dongfang has decided to base 
himself in Hong Kong to continue his battle for worker rights in 
the mainland. 
  Mr Han, whose passport was invalidated by Beijing last year, 
said he would no longer try to return to the mainland through 
the border checkpoints or other channels. 
  "It's their (the Chinese Government's) fault to force me to 
stay in Hong Kong. I've tried my best to return home ... now I 
hope they will do some remedies to their wrongdoings," he said. 
  Now a researcher of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial 
Committee on China's labour movement, Mr Han added that 
returning home was no longer his first priority. 
  "I've discovered that Hong Kong can provide a better 
environment and convenience for my work," he said. 
  Mr Han, however, reiterated that his long-term plan was to 
return to his motherland. 
  "My ultimate goal is staying neither in the U.S. nor in Hong 
Kong. I was left (by the Chinese Government) here and I'm now 
here just because Hong Kong is much closer to the mainland." 
  The activist is very busy with his newsletter, which focuses 
on the problems confronting China's labour movement. 
  The publication has 1,000 to 2,000 copies per issue sent to 
the mainland, Mr Han said. 
  "So far, I've received 15 responses from the mainland about 
my work. They are all very encouraging," he said. 
  He denied that his expulsion had separated him from the 
workers in China and disqualified him from being a labour 
activist. 
  "I've been one of them (Chinese workers) for more than 10 
years. I understand the relationship between the management and 
employees. The nature of the labour movement is more or less 
the same despite some superficial changes," Mr Han said. 
  "Also, I still maintain communication with mainland workers. 
I know where strikes have taken place and the reasons behind 
them." 
  After a one-month visit to the United States for the birth 
of 
his second son, Yuchen, Mr Han returned to the territory on May 
14 to renew his three-month work visa. 
  On the subject of China's Most Favoured Nation status with 
the United States, the unionist said conditions to ensure 
reasonable wages for Chinese workers and industrial safety 
should be attached to its renewal. 
  "Actually, trade itself is abuse of human rights if workers' 
interests are not protected," he said. 
  But Mr Han did not rule out that unemployment would result 
if 
the preferential trade status was removed. 
  Yesterday, Mr Han revealed that the wife of his lawyer, Zhou 
Guoqiang, who filed a lawsuit against the Chinese authorities 
for the "unlawful" invalidation of Mr Han's passport, had 
disappeared. 
  He did not eliminate the possibility that the wife, Wang Hui 
was, arrested.

million U.S. dollars. 
  About one third of the loans will be used for industrial

Merrill Lynch and Co., and Tat Lee Bank Ltd. 
  Established in 1991, the CEITIC is a national financial 
institution under the administrative control of the China 
Everbright Group Ltd. Its business activities focus on a

exchange, securities and investment. Its assets totalled eight 
billion renminbi (930 million U.S. dollars). 
  Outlining the corporation's development on the mainland, 
Wang 
said his corporation has cooperated with the Municipal

  [Text] Shantou, May 24 (XINHUA) -- Li Ka-shing, noted Hong 
Kong tycoon, has begun to invest in the energy, communications 
and housing of Shantou City, Guangdong Province. 
  His investment has reached about 4 billion yuan since the 
beginning of this year. 
  The projects include a bay bridge, four power plants, a 
container wharf at Zhuchigang Port, and a cement factory. 
  In late April, Li signed an agreement with Shantou Municipal 
Government on a housing project with a total floor space of 1.2 
million square meters. 
  The project will be completed by the end of 2000 and is 
expected to accommodate 70,000 residents. 
  In previous years, Li, chairman of the board of directors of 
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. of Hong Kong, mainly supported 
Shantou's development of public services. 
  As early as in 1982, Li donated funds for a university in 
Shantou. 
  His donations to the university have added up to 887 million 
HK dollars.

  [Text] Hong Kong, May 23 (XINHUA) -- Four former and 
serving customs officers in Hong Kong were today sentenced to 
prison for conspiracy to smuggle stolen goods to the Chinese 
Mainland and for bribery. 
  The four defendants were Tang Shu-wan, 33, former senior 
customs officer, NG Cheuk-wing, 38, senior customs officer, Woo 
Siu-man, 29, customs officer, and Cheng Siu-keung, 32, former 
customs officer. 
  They were given prison terms ranging from 18 months to six 
years by Deputy Judge Muttrie at a district court, according to 
a news release issued by the Independent Commission Against 
Corruption (ICAC). 
  The four were earlier convicted on a joint charge of 
conspiring with others to export unmanifested electrical goods 
and motor vehicles between July 1, 1991 and February 8, 1993, 
the news release said. 
  Tang, Ng and Woo were also found guilty of conspiring with 
others to accept bribes from a businessman in return for 
arranging or assisting the unimpeded clearance of unmanifested 
cargo from Hong Kong to the mainland through customs checkpoints 
during the same period, the news release said.

<F P=106> [By Scott McKenzie] </F>
  [Text] The number of emigrants returning to Hong Kong is 
so high that businesses would be hard hit if they were to head 
back overseas, the Government said yesterday. 
  More than 8,000 people who had fled Hong Kong to obtain 
foreign passports had returned to take advantage of the economic 
boom in 1992, said Deputy Secretary for Security Keith Kwok 
Ka-keung. "In the event of an economic downturn they could very 
well pack their suitcases and leave again. It is entirely 
possible," he said. 
  He did not have figures for the number of returnees last 
year, but said it was likely to be higher than 1992. Results of 
a survey on the problem would be released later in the year? Mr 
Kwok said. 
  Hong Kong University immigration expert Dr Ronald Skeldon 
said he believed "huge numbers" of emigrants had returned to 
Hong Kong in recent years and they were not reflected in 
official figures. 
  Dr Skeldon said the territory should be very aware that an 
economic downturn would send these people away in large numbers. 
"The main reason they have come here is for the money they were 
unable to make elsewhere and if that should change, they will 
leave," he said. The departure of people who worked in 
highly-skilled fields would leave a void far larger than that 
caused by the 1989 Beijing massacre which acted as a catalyst 
for emigration. 
  Mr Kwok said about 53,000 people emigrated from Hong Kong 
last year compared with 66,000 in 1992. Economic good times in 
the territory coupled with an economic downturn in countries 
such as Australia and Canada were major reasons for the drop. 
  Another cause was a reduced intake from some destination 
countries. The figures are based on the number of visas issued 
by consulates in Hong Kong. They do not include immigrant visas 
issued in other countries which an in creasing number of people 
are turning to in an effort to bypass the long delays for visas 
in Hong Kong. 
  Mr Kwok estimated a further 13 percent, or about 7,000, on 
top of the 53,000 who emigrated last year could have done so 
with visas obtained outside Hong Kong. That is an increase of 
about 12 percent from the 1990 figures. 
  To counter the problem in 1989, the Government initiated the 
British Nationality Selection Scheme which offered British 
passports to 13,160 heads of households and their dependants. 
The scheme offered an "insurance policy" to skilled people and 
kept them working in Hong Kong rather than leaving to get 
foreign passports. 
  Mr Kwok said it was "a bit risky" to say the scheme had a 
direct impact on the drop in emigration numbers for this year. 
But it might have had a stabilising effect.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 24 (XINHUA) -- A three-man 
consultation delegation from the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) arrived today in Pyongyang, capital of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
  Following an agreement between the DPRK and IAEA on May 21, 
the delegation, headed by Demetrius Perricos, director of the 
IAEA's division of operations in the department of safeguards, 
had made the trip to to engage in talks on the refueling of a 5 
megawatt fuel rod in a nuclear reaction center at Yongbyon. 
  Demetrius told reporters that the delegation, which is 
scheduled to stay here till May 28, will only talk about 
technical issues of replacing nuclear fuel rods. 
  He stressed that IAEA had not rejected DPRK's invitation to 
observe the replacement of the fuel rod, but the agency expected 
to carry out overall inspection on DPRK's nuclear equipment. 
  Since its demand had not been met, the IAEA did not deny 
that 
the delegation would hold negotiations with the DPRK about the 
precondition of nuclear inspections, Demetrius added. 
  He said that there were considerable disagreements between 
the IAEA and the DPRK on the issue of inspecting nuclear 
equipment and he hoped that the possibility of carrying out the 
program would emerge after the negotiations.

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (AFP)--Beijing's security chief has 
called for a strict public order crackdown in the capital, a 
report said Tuesday, less than two weeks before the fifth 
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  Su Zhongxiang, director of the Beijing municipal Public 
Security Bureau (PSB), called on all the capital's PSB organs to 
strengthen the defence of social stability and deal swiftly 
"with any problems that might emerge suddenly." Su, whose 
remarks were carried on the front page of the Public Security 
News [RENMIN GONGAN BAO], also stressed the importance of 
preventative policing in clamping down on criminal activity. 
  Security has been noticeably stepped up in Beijing in the 
past month amid heightened tension in the run up to the 
anniversary of the June 4 suppression of the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement. According to western military analysts, the number of 
People's Armed Police in Beijing has been steadily built up 
since 1989 and now totals some 100,000 officers who have been 
given intensive anti-riot training. 
  A general law and order crackdown launched at the beginning 
of the year has achieved "certain successes," the newspaper 
said. "But, in order to guarantee social order, the Beijing PSB 
has decided that all departments must take a stronger initiative 
in suppressing criminal activity." 
  The Beijing police have uncovered 2,731 criminal cases since 
January and broken up more than 400 criminal gangs, the 
newspaper added. 
  Su's remarks follow a series of warnings by top government 
and party officials on the issue of public order nationwide. 
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng both made recent 
speeches -- given wide publicity in the Chinese media -- 
stressing the paramount importance of ensuring social stability 
by all means necessary. Jiang even went so far as to defend the 
military suppression of June 4, which he credited for laying the 
foundation for China's current stability.

<F P=106> [Article by Kuan Chieh (7070 2212): "Two CPC Orders on </F>
Expanding the Police Force"] 
  [Text] Li Peng Endorses Orders Strengthening and 
Expanding the Police Force 
  Every country in the world has its own police force. 
  The responsibilities of a country's police are to preserve 
social order, curb crime, and protect the people. Of course, 
there are police who suppress the people. 
  The mainland has added the word "people's" to its police, to 
read the "People's Police." They should do more than the police 
in other countries in doing good for the people and serving the 
people but this is not the case. 
  As the mainland police have disclosed, in 1993, 7 percent of 
public security personnel were dismissed from their posts or 
transferred out of public security departments and about 3,400 
public security personnel were given criminal punishments or 
expelled from the CPC. This included more than 120 
section-level public security cadres. This situation suggests 
that, from one angle, the public security contingent is 
irrelevant to "serving the people" and neither is it a reliable 
tool of the party. This is, of course, a tragedy for the CPC, 
which entrusts its political power to the armed forces and the 
police force. 
  In order to strengthen and expand the police force, on 28 
March this year, Premier Li Peng endorsed Order No. 12 of 1994 
on "Strengthening, Rectifying, and Expanding the Public Security 
Contingent" and Order No. 13 of 1994 on "Supplementing and 
Improving the Armed Police Force." 
  Order No. 12 was issued through the Ministry of Public 
Security to the party committees of all provincial (autonomous 
regional) and city public security departments (bureaus) in 
early April whereas Order No. 13 was issued to all provincial 
(autonomous regional) and city armed police corps on 8 April. 
<H5>  The State Council Allocates 1.8 Billion Yuan to Public </H5>
Security Departments and Security Control Departments 
  Order No. 12 points out: In light of their social 
environments, all provinces (autonomous regions) and cities, 
from 1994 to 1996, should rectify and strengthen the leading 
groups of their public security contingents and develop these 
contingents in the ratio of 2 or 4.5 public security personnel 
per million of population, depending on the local conditions. 
In some important cities and in cities or regions where party, 
government, scientific, technological, and industrial 
organizations are concentrated, public security contingents 
should be formed in the ratio of 6:1,000. 
  Viewed from provincial public security departments' 
arrangements, the country will increase public security 
personnel by 400,000 from 1994 to 1995; the central and local 
authorities will build or expand 70 to 80 public security 
schools, 10 or 12 of which will be senior public security 
schools. The central government will be responsible for 40 
percent of the funding and local governments will allocate the 
remaining 60 percent. The central government will increase the 
percentage of fund allocation for some key provinces and cities 
appropriately. In mid-March, the State Council allocated 1.8 
billion yuan for public security departments and security 
control departments. An informed source confirmed that 35,000 
cadres (including demobilized soldiers) from localities and 
government institutions had been sent to work in public security 
departments. 
<H5>  The State Council Provides the Ministry of Public Security </H5>
With More Power To Use Force 
  With the State Council's authorization, on 1 March the 
Ministry of Public Security issued the "Regulations on the Use 
of Arms During Patrols and When Performing Duties." The 
regulations point out: Arms can be used against any resistance 
to arrest, any attempt to resist, any action of violent 
resistance, or any assault on public security personnel. Arms 
can be used to stop agitation in public or state buildings and 
any attempt to destroy state buildings, public property, 
government institutions, and vehicles, if persuasion proves to 
be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on party, 
government, and military institutions; public security 
departments; detention centers; prisons; financial 
organizations; banks; and important state departments. Arms can 
be used to stop assaults on radio and television stations as 
well as central and local press and news agencies, if a warning 
proves to be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop assaults on 
airports, seaports, customs departments, and frontier stations. 
Arms can be used to stop assaults on power stations, water 
supply centers, and railway departments, if a warning proves to 
be of no avail. Arms can be used to stop any attempt to 
blockade highways, shipping routes, railways, bridges, and 
tunnels, if a warning proves to be of no avail. 
<H5>  Tao Siju: The Public Security and Armed Police Forces Will </H5>
Deal With All Eventualities 
  Order No. 13 points out: Local governments should exercise 
direct leadership over armed police units. Armed police and 
public security units should be integrated. From 1994 to 1996, 
the country will expand the People's Armed Police Force [PAP] 
personnel to 450,000, improve the quality of the personnel, and 
enhance their efficiency in performing mobile duties. By the 
end of 1994, a three-level armed police force mechanism 
comprising provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities 
directly under the central authorities), prefectures, and 
counties will be formed. 
  It has been learned that more than 38,000 demobilized 
soldiers and soldiers on active service joined the PAP in 1993. 
Tao Siju, PAP political commissar Ministry of Public Security 
chief, said: The central task of public security and armed 
police units is to improve their quality, raise their work 
consciousness, and enhance their combat effectiveness. During 
an inspection of a police academy in early April, Tao Siju said: 
From now on, the public security and armed police forces will 
deal with contingencies. In an important region, the public 
security and armed police forces should be able to dispatch 
40,000 to 50,000 personnel to the scene of any eventuality 
within four hours. In the case of an emergency, they should be 
able to dispatch 5,000 to 8,000 personnel to the scene within 20 
minutes. 
  He also said: About 80,000 cadets will graduate from public 
security and armed police academies this year and they will be 
assigned to work in all parts of the country. These academies 
will recruit 150,000 cadets this year. Unqualified personnel 
will be removed from public security departments within three 
years. 
<H5>  The People's Police Have Become Tools To Suppress the People </H5>
  The abovementioned examples prove that the CPC is 
strengthening and expanding its police force. 
  Social order on the mainland is deteriorating. This is 
obvious to all. It is also an indisputable fact that the 
quality of mainland public security personnel is low, as is 
their efficiency in cracking criminal cases. Such being the 
case, the CPC needs to strengthen its police force. 
  Apart from maintaining social order and curbing crime, the 
public security and armed police forces are also responsible for 
cracking down on dissidents. To cope with one dissident, dozens 
or even hundreds of policemen are used. This includes following 
and keeping a watch on the dissident. When Wei Jingsheng tried 
to return from Tianjin to Beijing, seven truckloads of police 
were mobilized to stop him. If used this way, the police force 
does not have adequate personnel to cope with eventualities. In 
addition, the "Regulations on the Use of Arms During Patrols and 
When Performing Duties" run counter to the "PRC Constitution," 
which stipulates that civilians have the right to hold 
demonstrations. 
  The people's police have now become tools to suppress the 
people. CPC leaders have removed the disguise of the 
constitution and blatantly created the image of a police state 
among the people. Did any fascist, police state in the world 
ever come to a good end?

Openly Expresses `Reservations' About Shenzhen"] 
  [Text] At the Central Symposium on Economic Development 
held in Beijing in early April, Yao Yilin openly expressed his 
anxiety over the situation in Shenzhen and had reservations 
about Shenzhen, which is regarded as a model for reform. Yao 
said that he had been to Shenzhen and had made on-the-spot 
inspections on several occasions. Rather than following a 
feasible development plan, he insisted that Shenzhen has merely 
relied on foreign investment and backing from the central 
authorities and other localities. In addition, it depends on 
land sales. As foreign investment has slowed down, the city is 
now in a predicament. Yao Yilin said that many problems have 
been piling up in Shenzhen's social situation, the ranks of 
cadres, and urban construction. The central authorities are 
aware of the major problems, but solving them poses many 
difficulties.

  [Text] Fuzhou, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The first China Buddhist 
medicine symposium came to a close today in Wuyishan City, in 
east China's Fujian Province. 
  About 90 experts and scholars from the medical community of 
15 provinces and municipalities across the country attended the 
three-day conference, which received more than 70 papers. The 
meeting also announced the establishment of Wuyishan Society of 
Buddhist Medicine. 
  Participants in the symposium held that Buddhist medicine is 
a combination of natural science and humane studies, and is an 
important part of traditional Chinese medicine. 
  They believed that Buddhist medicine has also proved 
effective in curing some difficult and complicated cases of 
illness in the fields of surgery, gynecology, ophthalmology and 
in curing cancers, but they also stressed the need to strengthen 
research and development of Buddhist medicine and enhance 
exchanges with overseas corresponding organizations. 
  The conference heard that scientific research and teaching 
of 
Buddhist medicine have made great progress in the past ten and 
more years. 
  So far, Buddhist clinics, hospitals and related academic 
research institutes have been established in a dozen provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as at grass-roots 
Buddhist associations and in many famous temples.

<F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] A regional conference attended by leading party 
member-cadres of provincial- and prefectural-level departments 
took place at the Hall of the Tibetan People on the afternoon of 
22 May. 
  Leading comrades of the regional party committee, the 
regional people's congress, the regional government, and the 
regional committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference attended the meeting which was chaired 
by regional party committee secretary Chen Kuiyuan. 
  Comrade Raidi, executive deputy secretary of the regional 
party committee, gave a speech on the situation regarding 
Tibet's fight against splittism and the work to do in 
stabilizing the situation. [video shows close-up of Raidi 
reading from prepared notes, close-ups of Chen Kuiyuan and other 
Tibetan leaders perusing Raidi's report] He said: On the 
whole, Tibet's fight against splittism is satisfactory. The 
region is politically and socially stable, people of all 
nationalities are united, and the defense is strong along border 
areas. This has created a social environment good for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction; and good for improving 
people's livelihood. Owing to their class nature, however, 
hostile forces in the world and separatists at home and abroad 
will never accept their defeat willingly. They will continue to 
do everything they can to intensify their splittist activities. 
The antisplittist situation we are now facing is therefore still 
a severe one, and the mission we have to carry out is a 
formidable one. 
  Raidi said: All party and government organizations and we, 
as leading cadres, must be vigilant in peace time. We must have 
a clear understanding of the problems and the acute and complex 
antisplittist struggle we are now facing. We must have a clear 
idea of the situation, and know our assignments and carry them 
out properly. We must take the necessary precautionary measures 
against what might occur. 
  Raidi emphatically pointed out: Leadership is critical for 
stabilizing the situation. The regional party committee expects 
that top party and government leaders as well as all units will 
take personal charge of the work of stabilizing the situation, 
regularly study the situation and problems in their respective 
areas and units, and come up with plans with which they can lead 
the vast number of cadres and worker to fight splittism. 
Leading cadres must firmly and unequivocally handle major 
issues of principles. 
  To ensure Tibet's stability and the normal and healthy 
development of reform, opening up, and economic construction, 
Raidi urged party committees and governments at all levels to 
unite all forces that can be united, mobilize the initiative of 
all social quarters, and, on the basis of closely relying on the 
masses, build a stronger patriotic united front and give full 
rein to the special roles played by patriots and religious 
leaders of all nationalities in all quarters in fighting 
splittism and in stabilizing the situation. 
  Expressing his views on economic affairs, regional 
government 
chairman Gyaincain Norbu said: Since the beginning of the year, 
government organs at all levels, implementing the guidelines 
laid down by the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Tibet Regional Party Committee and by the regional economic 
conference, have intensified their reform efforts and opened 
wider to the outside world, and have achieved preliminary 
results in developing the economy. Compared with the same 
period last year, growth has been registered in all sectors -- 
agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, communications and 
transportation, capital construction, foreign trade, tourism, 
taxation, and banking. We have achieved the expected results. 
This year's reform projects require great efforts because the 
scope is broad, the standards are high, there are many problems 
to be resolved, and the assignments are heavy. To make sure 
that all reform projects are carried out successfully, we must 
stand firm in launching reform, fully understand what has to be 
done, educate the masses about reform, and make genuine efforts 
to speed up reform. Gyaincain Norbu also put forward 
requirements for accomplishing various production projects, 
making adequate arrangements for what the masses' needs in their 
daily life, intensifying the preparations for [word indistinct] 
construction projects, improving work style, and promoting 
planned parenthood. 
  Those attending the meeting also heard a report given by 
Comrade Zi Cheng, member of the regional party committee 
standing committee and secretary of its Politics and Law 
Committee, on the situation regarding public order and the fight 
against splittism. 
  In conclusion, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan stressed that the 
meeting 
was significant for Tibet in deepening reform, speeding up 
development, and maintaining stability. He said all 
prefectures, cities, and departments must earnestly implement 
its guidelines.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (AFP)--The Beijing authorities 
announced Wednesday fresh price controls on 34 staple 
commodities following widespread complaints from residents over 
illegal price hikes. 
  "This action aims at putting prices of these commodities and 
services within the level residents can stand," the municipal 
government said in a report. 
  Prices of 10 staples, including salt, coal, petrol and 
housing rents will be set by the state, while a monitoring 
system has been set up to record price fluctuations in 24 
others, including rice, edible oil, sugar and pork. Enterprises 
or shops wanting to raise prices must apply five-to-10 days in 
advance to the municipal price bureau for approval, the report 
said, adding that the bureau could intervene if the hikes were 
too extreme or too frequent. 
  Since the beginning of the year, price rises of staple 
commodities in medium and large cities throughout China -- amid 
nationwide inflation of around 21 percent -- have drawn strong 
protests from urban residents. 
  In a bid to curb inflation, the State Council sent six price 
inspection teams to 14 provinces at the end of March. 
  According to press reports, the teams have already handled 
more than 61,000 cases of illegal price-rising cases, involving 
more than 50 million yuan (5.7 million dollars).

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Jian (6392 0256): "Lu Ping Says, What Is </F>
More Important Is That We Rely on the Hong Kong People To 
Achieve Smooth Transition and Achieve the Goal of Hong Kong 
People Ruling Hong Kong"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 24 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--During a 
meeting with the delegation of the Alumni Association of the 
Hong Kong Pui Kui [pei qiao 1014 0294] Middle School in the 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse today, Lu Ping, director of the State 
Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, stressed that: In 
the wake of the breakdown of the talks on the political system, 
we are still striving to cooperate with the British side in 
other areas but, what is more important, is to focus our 
attention on relying on Hong Kong people to achieve a smooth 
transition and achieve Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong in the 
future. 
  Lu Ping said: We hope to cooperate with the British side so 
as to achieve the goal of smooth transition. However, if the 
British side does not cooperate I believe that, through our 
concerted efforts and though this means the work will be a 
little more difficult, it will conform with our common 
aspirations and will surely guarantee Hong Kong's smooth 
transition. Lu Ping added: I have full confidence in this. 
  Lu Ping stressed: Since reform and opening up, China's 
economy has thrived and its overall national strength has 
continuously increased. This is an important guarantee for Hong 
Kong's smooth transition and long-term stability and prosperity. 
  Speaking about the Hong Kong airport issue, Lu Ping said: We 
hope that the question of financial arrangements for the airport 
can be settled at an early date. Our principle is that we hope 
it entails low input and produces good efficiency so that it 
will not leave an enormous financial burden for the government 
of the future special administrative region [SAR]. 
  The guests asked a question about the post-1997 civil 
servants and Lu Ping reiterated: Except for the 20 or so senior 
officials, I hope that all the other civil servants will remain 
in their original posts. I hope everyone will work with their 
minds set at rest. 
  He said: As for the 20 or so senior officials, since they 
will have to be nominated by the government of the future SAR 
and appointed by the central government, we have no right to 
interfere in the matter now. 
  Regarding the question of real estate prices which is 
currently a concern to Hong Kong people, he said, we are 
concerned with this question from the angle of hoping for smooth 
transition. If real estate prices are too high, it will affect 
both the livelihoods of Hong Kong residents and Hong Kong's 
status as an international financial and trading center. He 
added: We hope that Hong Kong's real estate prices will go down 
slowly. 
  Lu Ping said: The year 1997 is a mere three years away. The 
time is very short and yet a lot of preparatory work has to be 
done. What we will do is create better conditions for Hong Kong 
people ruling Hong Kong after 1997 in political, economic, and 
other areas. 
  Lu Ping said: The work of the Preliminary Work Committee is 
also intended to accumulate experiences for Hong Kong people 
ruling Hong Kong. He believes that Hong Kong people will 
definitely be able to exercise good rule over Hong Kong. 
  Liao Hui, director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese 
Affairs Office, simultaneously met with the 66-person delegation 
of the Alumni Association of the Hong Kong Pui Kui Middle School 
headed by Zhang Huafeng. They came from Hong Kong, Britain, 
Australia, the Philippines, and other places. Liao Hui 
explained to them in detail China's consistent policy for 
Overseas Chinese affairs.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- General Liu Huaqing, 
vice-chairman of the China's Central Military Commission, met 
with visiting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin 
and his party here today. 
  In a cordial and friendly atmosphere, the two sides 
exchanged 
views on issues of mutual concern. 
  Liu noted that the two countries' enhancement of friendly 
ties of cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit 
accords with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is 
beneficial to the peace and stability of the region and the 
world as a whole. 
  Bilateral cooperation in various fields has bright 
prospects, 
he stressed. 
  As the two nations are focused on economic growth, expanding 
cooperation with each other and learning from each other's 
strong points to make up for each other's shortcomings is of 
much significance to the development of their economies, science 
and technology, Liu said. 
  The Russian Government pays much attention to the 
development 
of its friendly cooperation with China, Shokhin said, adding 
that Russia is willing to expand this cooperation in economy, 
science and technology, culture and other fields and promote the 
mutual prosperity of the two economies. 
  Lieutenant General Cao Gangchuan, deputy chief of the 
General 
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army; Shi Guangsheng, 
vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation; Major 
General Huai Guomo, of the Commission of Science, Technology,

  [Text] Beijing, May 24 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese side is 
looking forward to Russian Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin's 
visit to China and hopes the visit will deepen bilateral 
relations, according to Chinese diplomats and trade officials in 
recent interviews with XINHUA. 
  The Russian prime minister is scheduled to arrive here on 
May 
26 for a four-day official visit at the invitation of his 
Chinese counterpart Li Peng. 
  "China attaches much importance to the first visit here by 
the Russian head of government," a Chinese Foreign Ministry 
official in charge of Russian affairs said, adding that the 
visit is expected to be a complete success. 
  Noting the 4,000 km-long Sino-Russian border, the official 
said the maintenance of long-term, stable and good-neighborly 
ties of friendship and mutual benefit between the two countries 
is in the fundamental interests of the two peoples and conducive 
to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the 
world as a whole. 
  Sino-Russian relations in various fields have recorded rapid 
development since the establishment of diplomatic ties between 
the two countries, he said. 
  Since Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit here in late 
1992, the mutually beneficial cooperation in politics, economy, 
culture, science and technology, and other fields has developed 
in a "healthy and sustained" fashion, he said. 
  The two countries have also maintained normal consultations 
and cooperation on major international issues, he said. 
  This year, Sino-Russian relations are marked by the increase 
of high-level contacts between the two countries, he said. The 
high-level contacts, no doubt, play a positive role in 
propelling bilateral relations forward. 
  During the forthcoming visit of the Russian prime minister, 
leaders of the two countries will exchange views on the 
enhancement of bilateral relations, especially of mutually 
beneficial economic and trade cooperation. 
  A number of documents for cooperation are expected to be 
signed, sources here said. 
  An official of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic 
Cooperation said that since the two countries signed an economic 
and trade cooperation agreement at the beginning of 1992, 
bilateral trade ties have been developing rapidly. 
  He said the bilateral trade figure was 5.8 billion U.S. 
dollars in 1992, which was higher than the highest one between 
China and the former Soviet Union, adding that the figure in 
1993 was 7.7 billion U.S. dollars, representing an increase of 
31 percent. 
  In addition, means of bilateral economic and trade 
cooperation were diversifying with the development of barter 
trade, cash trade, compensation trade, leasing and mutual 
investment, he said. 
  The official noted that the two economies are highly 
mutually 
complementary and there is a broad prospect for bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation, as well as scientific and 
technological cooperation. 
  In general trade, using its main foreign trade channels such 
as large trade corporations, China will seize the opportunity to 
press for a gradual shift from the dominant barter trade to cash 
trade with involvement of all foreign trade means, he said. 
  He said that China will continue to stress the role of 
border 
and regional economic and trade cooperation, strengthening 
administration over border trade and the standardization of 
commodities inspection, in a bid to facilitate the development 
of such cooperation and two-way investment. 
  He expressed the hope that the two countries will make full 
use of land transport, along with more development of sea 
transport for developing bilateral trade.

  [Text] Beijing, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The coming visit to 
China by Russian Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin is an event 
of great significance in Russian-Chinese ties, said Russian 
Ambassador to China Igor A. Rogachev. 
  The visit will help to propel the bilateral ties, the 
ambassador told XINHUA here in a recent interview. 
  The Russian prime minister is scheduled to arrive here 
tomorrow for a four-day official visit to China at the 
invitation of his Chinese counterpart Li Peng. 
  During the first-ever visit here by a Russian prime 
minister, 
leaders of the two countries will exchange views on the 
deepening of bilateral ties, especially those in the economic 
and trade fields, the ambassador said. 
  Half a dozen or so documents of co-operation are expected to 
be signed here, covering topics ranging from economy and 
environmental protection to agriculture and other fields, he 
added. 
  He noted that this year, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev and State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, and Deputy Prime 
Minister Aleksandr Shokhin visited here. The latter arrived 
here Wednesday [25 May] to co-chair the second session of the 
Russia-China Committee on Co-operation in Economy, Trade, 
Science and Technology. 
  The Russian side is making preparations for the early 
realization of the second summit meeting with China, he 
revealed, adding that Chernomyrdin's visit is the most important 
event in the run-up to the summit. 
  On domestic situation, Rogachev noted that Russia is 
experiencing more and more factors of stability. 
  Referring to the development of the bilateral ties in the 
past two years, Rogachev noted that since President Yeltsin's 
visit here in late 1992 there have been more high-level contacts 
between the two countries. Last year Russia and China received, 
respectively, some 40 delegations from the other side, all at or 
above the ministerial level. 
  The bilateral co-operation in economy and trade, science and 
technology and other fields have also logged "remarkable" and 
"satisfactory" achievements, he said. 
  Last year, the two-way trade volume reached a record high of 
7.68 billion U.S. dollars, up 30 percent over the previous year. 
  The two economies are highly complementary and the potential 
for bilateral economic co-operation is "great", Rogachev said. 
  He held that the Russian-Chinese economic and trade 
co-operation should be directed gradually toward the setting up 
of joint ventures. In this way, the two sides can fully employ 
Russia's fuel and other natural resources and China's rich 
agricultural and labor resources. 
  As to some new problems emerging from the bulging economic 
and trade co-operation between the two countries, more efforts 
are needed from both sides to solve them, the Russian ambassador 
said.

  [Text] Beijing, 13 May (XINHUA) -- In recent years, the 
total amount of China's state-owned assets rapidly increased and 
their economic efficiency turned for the better as our socialist 
market economy developed in depth. According to the latest 
statistics compiled by the State Administration of State 
Property [SASP], as of the end of 1992, the total amount of the 
book value of China's state-owned assets increased 14.3 percent, 
or 385.1 billion yuan, from 2,684.6 billion yuan in the previous 
year to reach 3,069.7 billion yuan (excluding either the assets 
in terms of resources or the army units' and armed police force 
units' state-owned assets). 
  Of the total amount of state-owned assets 1,458.4 billion 
yuan, or 47.5 percent, were under the management of central 
government units and 1,611.3 billion yuan, or 52.5 percent, were 
under the management of local governments. Of the total amount 
of state-owned assets, 72 percent, or 2,210.1 billion yuan, were 
used to conduct business operations, while the remaining 28 
percent, or 859.6 billion yuan were not used to conduct business 
operations. The amount of state-owned assets used to conduct 
business operations posted an increase of 13.1 percent, or 256.5 
billion yuan, over the previous year. 
  The total amount of state-owned assets represented the 
overwhelming majority of the total amount of assets in society. 
State enterprises took a leading role in the whole national 
economy. 
  In terms of sectors, as of the end of 1992, the total amount 
of state-owned industrial enterprises' assets reached 1,649.8 
billion yuan. State-owned enterprises accounted for over 90 
percent of such important industries as energy, communications, 
mineral products, high technology, banking, and foreign trade 
which have a bearing on the national economy and the people's 
livelihood. The growth rate of the total amount of state-owned 
assets of the industrial, architectural engineering, 
agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy sectors was higher 
than the national average growth rate by more than 10 percentage 
points. Among them, the total amount of state-owned assets of 
the real estate industry and enterprises that implement a 
shareholding system posted the fastest growth rate. As of the 
end of 1992, the total amount of state-owned assets of the real 
estate industry reached 90.5 billion yuan, an increase of 69.8 
percent over the previous year, and the total amount of 
state-owned assets of the enterprises that implement a 
shareholding system reached 28.4 billion yuan, an increase of 
175.7 percent over the previous year. 
  In terms of regions, the state-owned assets under the 
management of local governments enjoyed very rapid growth in 
recent years. Shandong Province, whose state-owned assets posted 
a growth rate of as high as 30.5 percent in 1992, enjoyed the 
fastest growth of all. The state-owned assets of coastal areas 
in east China, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and 
Fujian, posted an average growth rate of 21.7 percent; those of 
south China regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan, 
17.3 percent; and those of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and other 
regions 16.6 percent. In terms of regional distribution, 
coastal areas captured a bigger amount of state-owned assets 
than others. As of the end of 1992, the top 10 provinces and 
municipalities that took the leading rank in terms of the total 
amount of state-owned assets under the management of local 
governments were as follows: Guangdong had 165.7 billion yuan; 
Jiangsu, 103.2 billion yuan; Shandong, 102.8 billion yuan; 
Liaoning, 96.5 billion yuan; Sichuan, 87.7 billion yuan; 
Shanghai 82.7 billion yuan; Beijing, 79.2 billion yuan; Hubei, 
69.6 billion yuan; Hebei, 66.3 billion yuan; and Zhejiang, 62.5 
billion yuan. 
  An authoritative person of the SASP said: The above figures 
show that, expedited by reform and opening up, state-owned 
assets are growing continuously and very rapidly. The entire 
state-owned economy is continuously expanding and represents a 
leading force of China's national economy. 
  He also pointed out: As a result of deepening reform and 
opening up wider, state-owned enterprises have been continuously 
invigorated and their economic efficiency has turned for the 
better. At the end of 1992, China's state-owned enterprises 
turned 329.1 billion yuan in tax payments over to the state, an 
increase of 16 percent, or 45.3 billion yuan, over the previous 
year; they made profits worth 117.6 billion yuan, an increase of 
11.3 percent, or 11.9 billion yuan, over the previous year. The 
ratio of enterprises that suffered losses dropped 7.3 percentage 
points from the previous year's 31.6 percent to 24.3 percent. 
The ratio that the amount of losses captured in the economic 
returns of business operations dropped from the previous year's 
32.1 percent to 26.7 percent. The taxes paid by state-owned 
enterprises to the state accounted for approximately two thirds 
of the budgeted revenue.
