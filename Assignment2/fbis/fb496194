  [Text] Washington, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The State Department 
Monday refuted North Korea's claim that the Korean Armistice 
Agreement is useless and invalid, affirming that the pact 
remains in effect. Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly, 
commenting on Pyongyang's statement that the Armistice Agreement 
is null and should be replaced by a peace pact, said that "We 
cannot accept its claim that the armistice is `useless' or 
`invalid.'" 
  "Our position is that the Armistice Agreement remains in 
effect. We are proceeding on that basis," Shelly said. 
  Pyongyang officials have demanded negotiations with 
Washington on the matter, a move interpreted here and in Seoul 
as an attempt to blur the current international focus on the 
North Korean nuclear row and to engage the United States in yet 
another form of dialogue. 
  North Korea insists that talks on the peace agreement should 
be held exclusively between it and the United States since South 
Korea is not a signatory of the 1953 armistice pact. 
  "...We note that in February 1992, North and South Korea 
agreed that questions of peace and security on the peninsula 
should be resolved primarily through inter-Korean dialogue," 
said Shelly. "We strongly support that approach." 
  The spokeswoman added that Washington will abort all talks 
with Pyongyang if the latter goes ahead and refuels a nuclear 
reactor without the presence of International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) experts. North Korean officials have repeatedly 
threatened to go ahead with the refueling if the IAEA continues 
to make inspection demands on the process. 
  Reminding that inter-Korean talks can play an important part 
in resolving the nuclear impasse, Shelly said Washington hopes 
the two Koreas will resume dialogue in the near future.

<F P=106> [By Cho Se-hyon] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
has decided to reject -- firmly and unequivocally -- yet another 
North Korean attempt to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement 
with a peace treaty with the United States alone. 
  Cornered by a scheme of its own making (the Stalinist 
state's 
refusal to allow outside inspection of its nuclear facilities), 
North Korea is obviously trying to muddy the issue and eliminate 
Seoul as a player in the nuclear row. 
  Taking advantage of Washington's efforts to maintain the 
global nuclear non-proliferation regime at any cost, Pyongyang 
is trying to force the United States to pull its troops from 
South Korea by linking the withdrawal with the nuclear question. 
North Korea's attempts, which are not very difficult to fathom, 
are of course unacceptable to Seoul. 
  Washington firmly rejected Pyongyang's overture after North 
Korea, in a Foreign Ministry statement issued on April 28, 
proposed negotiations between the two on concluding a peace 
treaty. 
  Pyongyang followed up by serving notice that it would 
withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Prior to 
this, North Korea had refused to attend MAC meetings since March 
1991 when South Korean Major General Hwang Won-tak was appointed 
chief delegate of the United Nations forces. The North said it 
would not recognize Hwang since the South was not a signatory to 
the Armistice Agreement. 
  In short, Pyongyang wants to replace the Armistice Agreement 
signed in 1953 between North Korea and China on one side and the 
United Nations on the other with a U.S.-North Korean peace 
treaty. 
  This is not the first time that North Korea has advanced the 
idea of signing a peace pact with the United States. 
  Pyongyang made that overture to the United States 
persistently before signing the basic accord on reconciliation, 
non-aggression and exchanges with South Korea in 1992. 
  Outwardly, North Korea said a peace treaty was needed to 
restore peace to the peninsula. South and North Korea are 
technically still at war some 40 years after the conflict ended. 
But Seoul refused to accept the North Korean proposal at face 
value because its real intention was to force Washington to 
withdraw its troops deployed in the South. 
  South and North Korea argued about problems related to the 
need for a peace treaty until they signed the 1992 inter-Korean 
basic accord. In the five-item supplementary agreement to the 
inter-Korean accord on reconciliation, the two sides agreed to 
faithfully implement the accord and the declaration for the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula in order to transform 
the state of war into that of a lasting peace. 
  It follows, therefore, that if North Korea wants to raise 
the 
problem of a peace treaty, it has to honor the inter-Korean 
accord as well as the denuclearization declaration, the Seoul 
government says. 
  The supplementary agreement also spells out that South and 
North Korea will work out appropriate measures to change the 
state of war into peace and that the two sides will honor the 
Armistice Agreement until a firm peace is established. 
  Consequently, Seoul maintains that the recent attempt by 
North Korea to conclude a peace treaty with the United States 
obviously violates the inter-Korean basic accord. 
  South Korean ministries concerned with unification are said 
to be coordinating their views on "a rather drastic" North 
Korean attempt to sign a peace treaty with the United States, 
one-sidedly ignoring the inter-Korean agreements. 
  So far, the Seoul government has viewed the North Korean 
move 
as undeserving of comment. But it was reported that Seoul was 
still unable to adopt countermeasures to an apparent North 
Korean violation of the armistice treaty. 
  "The government is currently analyzing North Korea's real 
intention," said one senior official. "We plan to approach the 
problem cautiously, taking into consideration all aspects of 
inter- Korean relations including the nuclear question." 
  In other words, the Seoul government will firmly oppose the 
North Korean move to conclude a peace treaty with the United 
States while trying to find a solution to North Korea's 
violation of the Armistice Agreement through dialogue.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu reiterated Tuesday that replacing the 
Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace pact is a matter for 
Seoul and Pyongyang, not Pyongyang and Washington, to work out. 
  "The United States is a signatory of the Armistice and 
therefore will get involved in that sense," Han told reporters, 
"but Washington fully agrees with Seoul that the matter is for 
the two Koreas to resolve." 
  North Korea will end up hindering high-level dialogue with 
the United States if it insists on the change, Han said. "The 
next round of North Korea-U.S. dialogue will not discuss this 
issue." 
  Pyongyang unilaterally announced last week that it was 
withdrawing from the Military Armistice Commission but would 
keep on its commission secretaries and liaison officers. 
  In addition, it announced that Poland, a Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission (NNSC) member chosen by North Korea, will 
be withdrawn from the commission. 
  Han said the North was trying to isolate the South in 
talking 
only with the United States and trying to "break up" Seoul- 
Washington relations.

  [Text] The National Unification Board [NUB] urged North 
Korea today to earnestly abide by the Armistice Agreement and 
normalize the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] as soon as 
possible. 
  Through a spokesman's statement, the NUB pointed out that 
North Korea's suspension of the MAC function and demand for 
replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement with 
the United States is a violation of Article 61 of the Armistice 
Agreement, which states that the agreement can only be amended 
upon mutual agreement between North and South Korea, and Article 
5 of the basic agreement between the South and the North. 
  The NUB stressed that until an alternative replacing the 
current armistice organization is provided, the agreements 
should be earnestly abided by and any action intended to make 
the current armistice organization defunct cannot be justified. 
  The NUB pointed out that, at a time when the North Korean 
nuclear issue is at a critical point, North Korea's threatening 
of the current armistice system is intended to delay the 
resolution of the nuclear issue and blur the essence of the 
issue, and strongly urged North Korea to show a sincere attitude 
toward the resolution of the nuclear issue as soon as possible.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
on Tuesday urged North Korea to give up their "undue intent" of 
withdrawing from the Military Armistice Commission and instead 
show sincerity toward settling the nuclear question. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Hong-ku said North Korea's planned 
withdrawal from the truce commission is an express violation of 
the existing Armistice Agreement and the basic South-North 
agreement. "Their move is an irresponsible act of scheming to 
neutralize the existing armistice agreement," Yi said. He is 
concurrent National Unification minister. 
  In an interview with three major broadcasting stations, the 
deputy premier said that any issue related to the existing truce 
agreement should be discussed duly through South-North dialogue. 
He noted that the basic South-North agreement stipulates in its 
Article 5 that issues related to the Armistice Agreement should 
be resolved through inter-Korean concurrence. Yi said, however, 
that this is no time to discuss the issue with North Korea. "It 
is not desirable to raise another question at a time when the 
nuclear issue has arrived at a vital point," he said. 
  Meanwhile, spokesman Kim hyong-ki of the National 
Unification 
Board said the North Korean intent represents an outright 
violation of the provisions of Article 61 of the Armistice 
Agreement and Article 5 of the basic South-North agreement. "Our 
unchanging position is that the issue of changing the existing 
armistice system including replacement of the truce agreement 
should be resolved independently between the direct parties 
involved, namely, South and North Korea," Kim said in a 
statement. 
  The spokesman charged that the North Korean act of 
threatening the existing truce mechanism at this time when the 
nuclear issue has reached an important juncture, cannot but be 
an attempt to delay the resolution of the nuclear issue and 
becloud the essence of the nuclear question. "The existing 
armistice system should be preserved faithfully until an 
alternative to the system is worked out," Kim said, adding that 
no attempt to neutralize the existing truce mechanism can be 
justified.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has expressed 
the intent of withdrawing from the Military Armistice 
Commission, officials at the United Nations Command [UNC] in 
Korea said on Monday. 
  In addition, North Korea has let it be known that they would 
remove Polish members from the Neutral Nations Supervisory 
Commission, a UNC official at the Armistice Commission said. 
Early last year, North Korea withdrew Czech delegates from the 
truce-watching commission. Poland and Czechoslovakia had been 
the communist-side-chosen member countries of the four-country 
supervisory commission, whose delegates were responsible for 
watching the North Korean area. 
  The planned withdrawal by North Korea is an express 
violation 
of the Armistice Agreement, over the issue of which the U.N. 
Command has been contacting North Korean delegates and UNC 
member countries related to the maintenance of the truce 
agreement, a UNC official said.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and an editorial published in Seoul vernacular dailies 
on 3 May on the recent North Korean attempt to replace the 1953 
Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and its declaration to 
withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission, MAC, and that 
it will expel the Polish delegate to the Neutral Nations 
Supervisory Commission. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 1 a 1,000-word 
article by Kim Chang-ki entitled: "North Korea Unilaterally 
Withdraws from the MAC -- Strategy Aimed at U.S.-North Korean 
Peace Agreement." The article writes: "North Korea's attitude 
is analyzed to be a scheme to turn the MAC, stipulated in the 
Armistice Agreement, into a mere scrap of paper and virtually 
destroy it, as noted by the government officials concerned." 
The article continues: "The North Korean side, however, said 
that it will abide by the existing Armistice Agreement until the 
replacement agreement is signed and that it will continue to 
maintain the hotline between military authorities, such as joint 
duty officers, of the two sides presently in operation in 
Panmunjom." The article cites remarks by a relevant government 
official: "The North Korean attempt to incapacitate the MAC 
must be its strategic move to reinforce its demand for replacing 
the Armistice Agreement with a U.S.-North Korean peace agreement 
and to discuss this issue in a full-fledged manner at the third 
round of North Korean-U.S. talks." 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,700-word 
article by Pak Tu-sik entitled: "The Scheme Behind North 
Korea's Declaration on Withdrawal From MAC." The article notes: 
"The North Korean strategy is to force the U.S. Forces out of 
the ROK through a peace agreement with the United States," 
adding: "In order to maximize its force of negotiation, North 
Korea is attempting to virtually scrap the MAC, the implementing 
organization of the Armistice Agreement, while conducting 'small 
provocations' near the Military Demarcation Line, MDL, annoying 
the ROK and the United States. This is interpreted to be the 
North Korean strategic move to create a situation in which the 
North Korean-U.S. peace agreement has to be discussed at the 
third round of U.S.-North Korean talks." 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 5 a 
1,200-word article by Pak Chae-pom entitled: "The Background of 
North Korea's Notification of Its Unilateral Withdrawal from the 
MAC -- Scheming To Deal Directly With the United States by 
Scrapping the Armistice Agreement." The article notes recent 
reports on North Korean moves, including provocative military 
actions near the MDL, and cites a Defense Ministry official's 
remark: "If the Armistice Agreement is suspended according to 
the North Korean demand, the situation on the Korean peninsula 
will be ambiguous -- neither peace nor armistice. North Korea 
has called for the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a 
peace agreement, and is sure to call upon the United States for 
direct negotiations. The North Korean moves are a calculated 
action aimed at eliminating the ROK from the discussion of 
issues on the Korean peninsula." 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled: "Why Is North Korea Shaking Up the 
Armistice System?" The editorial begins: "North Korea, being 
cornered by the nuclear issue, is making a dangerous gamble to 
get out of a crisis," and notes: "North Korea is making these 
provocative moves to heighten the feeling of danger of military 
conflict and psychological anxiety on the Korean peninsula to 
disperse the international concern on the nuclear inspection 
issue and to maximize the utility of the nuclear card." The 
editorial continues: "Announcing its unilateral withdrawal from 
the MAC, North Korea stated that it will abide by the present 
Armistice Agreement until a new peace system, which it demands, 
is established and that the military hotline will continue. In 
view of the North Korean attempt to scrap the armistice system, 
we cannot believe this statement. North Korea's unilateral 
decision itself is a grave violation of the Armistice Agreement, 
and this is the first of its attempts to destroy the armistice 
system. If this attempt by North Korea is tolerated, it will 
commit other acts that violate the Armistice Agreement, creating 
a crisis." The editorial concludes: "North Korea is an 
unpredictable opponent, therefore, if the MAC, which maintains 
the armistice system and manages crises, is incapacitated, it 
could bring about the danger of an armed conflict. The 
government should not simply concentrate on assuring the people 
of the lack of signs of North Korean provocation, but see the 
seriousness of the problem and establish a posture of 
preparedness to cope with the ensuing developments."

  [Text] Diplomatic sources in Beijing reported on 2 May that 
North Korea recently drastically strengthened vigilance at the 
border area with China to prevent North Korean people from 
escaping, and that it instructed the military and police that if 
escapees are discovered, they are to be immediately shot to 
death. 
  The North Korean authorities moved the agents of the 
(?Security Department) and Ministry of Public Security, who were 
serving in the rear, toward the border area of North Hamgyong 
Province and Chagang Province. They are intensely watching over 
the moves of the residents and soldiers. It was learned that 
because of such vigilance, the number of North Koreans escaping 
to China has decreased drastically.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- Song Yong-tae, vice 
minister of the National Unification Board, reaffirmed Friday 
that the government will go ahead with its policy of seeking 
early repatriation of North Korean loggers in Russia. 
  Speaking to business leaders at a breakfast meeting held 
under the auspices of the Korea Management Association at the 
Hyatt Hotel, Song also said various government agencies were 
devising measures to help the loggers settle in South Korea. 
  While delivering a speech entitled "The Outlook for the 
North 
Korean Nuclear Problem and the Seoul-Pyongyang Relationship," 
Song revealed that Pyongyang has stopped issuing travel 
certificates to North Koreans and strictly limited entry by 
foreigners since mid-March in an apparent effort to heighten 
internal tension. 
  Pyongyang recently increased military activity 50 percent 
and 
resumed anti-air raid drills in the Yongbyon area, which Western 
countries suspect has facilities capable of producing nuclear 
weapons, Song said. North Korea had suspended the drills in the 
Yongbyon area last June.

    [Editorial Report] The conservative vernacular daily 
CHOSON ILBO in Korean on 2 May publishes in its "Reporter's 
Memobook" column on page 2 a 1,200-word article by Moscow-based 
correspondent O Chung-sok, under the headline "Diplomacy for 
Loggers." 
  Reporting that ROK-Russia foreign ministers' talks were held 
in Moscow on 14 April to discuss the issue of North Korean 
escapees from logging camps in Russia, the article notes the 
Russian Government's basic position, according to the Russian 
foreign minister during a news conference after the talks, that 
Russia "promised" to protect the safety of the escapees and that 
Russia is not opposed to their "defection" to the ROK. However, 
he "politely" rejected the interference of a third party, such 
as the United Nations, in the issue of giving them "refugee 
status," stressing that the issue can be resolved through 
"ROK-Russian cooperation." 
  Nevertheless, the article explains that a responsible 
government office in Seoul said with a "preconception" that the 
foreign ministers of the two countries "agreed" to give the 
refugee position to the North Korean escapees and to "send" them 
to the ROK "as soon as possible." Besides, despite a "frank 
confession" by Foreign Minister Han that the two sides failed to 
reach an agreement on the "refugee status issue," the mass media 
reported that the foreign minister stated during a news 
conference after returning to Seoul that the Russian Government 
"completely agreed" on all issues including the refugee status 
issue, thus "distorting" the truth. Noting that our diplomatic 
activities are "ununderstandable," the article criticizes the 
attempt of the ROK Foreign Ministry to "distort and exaggerate" 
the result of the talks, and stresses that the issue of 
defection of the North Korean escapees from logging camps in 
Russia has now been thrown into a "deadlock," because the 
Russian side is not moving toward the "concrete steps," although 
it promised to "cooperate in principle." 
  The article points out that the ROK diplomacy, which 
attempts 
to resolve problems "at a breath" without paying attention to 
the situation in its partner country, has now been "caught in a 
trap," and that most of North Korean loggers, who escaped from 
the camps, have "disappeared" fearing that their lives are 
"threatened." The article concludes by asking our government how 
it should take the "responsibility" if their defection is "not 
realized" and their safety is "not guaranteed."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Domestic Policies Reflected </F>
in Kim Il-song's New Year's Address"] 
  [Text] Seoul, NAEWOE -- Kim Il-song's New Year's address 
for 1994, while focusing on the economy, touches on military, 
reunification, nuclear, and foreign policy issues. At a glance, 
it appears to say nothing about domestic political issues, 
except in passages devoted to a general assessment of the state 
of the nation. While other parts of the address, including 
those on the economy, are of course essentially linked with 
developments on the domestic political front, one can hardly 
find any specific references to them--at least as specific as 
those made to other topics. 
  Nevertheless, inasmuch as North Korea has problems in each 
and every domain addressed in the speech--economic, military, 
the South and reunification, nuclear, and foreign policy--it is 
inconceivable that the internal political sphere alone is 
trouble-free. 
  The fact is that despite its alleged stability at home, 
North 
Korea failed to achieve its economic goals and, as a result, had 
to allow a 3-year readjustment period. And the admission to the 
failure of the Third Seven-Year Plan precisely alludes to 
instability and chaos on the domestic political front. 
  The 1994 Kim Il-song New Year's address contains several 
passages lending support to this observation. 
  The first such passage is: "The maneuvers waged by the 
imperialists and reactionaries last year to isolate and 
suffocate our Republic and crush our socialist cause were 
unprecedentedly vicious, causing an extremely tense situation in 
our country." 
  In fact, the so-called imperialists and reactionaries or 
their maneuvers from outside to isolate North Korea and crush 
its socialist cause, as alleged by Kim Il-song, did not exist. 
Therefore, what he was speaking about was internal foes, the 
alleged tension meaning an internal situation created by them. 
  Next is the passage dealing with Operation Team Spirit. 
Under 
the pretext of a "severe ordeal confronting the fatherland and 
the revolution," North Korea declared a state of semi-war. By 
doing so, Kim Il-song said, it "defended honorably the dignity 
and safety of the socialist fatherland, demonstrating the 
indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the fullest." 
<H5>  Pending Tasks Listed in the Address Suggest Problems </H5>
  Since Team Spirit is an annual, defensive exercise and not a 
military provocation against North Korea, it can by no means be 
a "severe ordeal" that calls for the declaration of a state of 
semi-war. Nonetheless, Kim Il-song asserted that North Korea 
"crushed the enemies' provocations and maneuvers and honorably 
defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland, 
demonstrating the indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the 
fullest." 
  What he called "provocations and aggression" here did not, 
in 
fact, exist. Then, what was it that North Korea had to defend 
"the dignity and safety of socialism" against? And what is the 
truth of "the spirit of chuche Korea demonstrated to the 
fullest" under such circumstances? In a nutshell, it is in 
effect a confession that North Korea used the training exercise, 
staged south of the truce line, to deal with its domestic 
problems, the political chaos in particular. 
  To prove it, Kim Il-song stated that "this is a victory of 
the revolutionary line of our party and a victory of the 
wholehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses." 
  At the same time, he explained the meaning of such victories 
by saying that North Korea "again forcefully proved, through 
severe ordeals and struggles in the recent period, that our 
party is a great party with an iron will and a tested 
leadership, that our people are a heroic people tested by 
revolutionary ordeals and blessed with an indomitable spirit of 
struggle, and that our way of socialism embodying the chuche 
ideology is an invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses 
of people." 
  In other words, of these two remarks, the latter explains 
the 
backgrounds of organizational issues weighed at the 21st plenum 
of the sixth party Central Committee held in December last year 
and the sixth session of the Supreme People's Assembly, while 
the former is gibberish aimed at justifying the results of and 
measures taken in those sessions. 
  The ousting of Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, known as 
leading technocrats of the North Korean regime, could be an act 
of censuring them for the "severe ordeals" of the economic 
crisis. And the reappearance of Kim Yong-chu and his appointment 
as vice president; the promotion of Hwang Chang-yop, known as 
chuche ideology theoretician, to chairmanship of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee; the rise of Yang Hyong-sop--he and Hwang 
Chang-yop are considered the twin masters of the chuche 
ideology--to No. 18 from No. 32 in the power hierarchy, and the 
fact that nine of the 17 new members and candidate members named 
to the party Central Committee are military personnel on active 
duty--all these measures represented moves to expand the power 
base of the Kim Chong-il leadership. 
<H5>  Team Spirit Used to Deal With Political Chaos </H5>
  Therefore, the fact that the father-to-son succession is yet 
to be finalized 20 years after Kim Chong-il was officially 
designated the heir apparent, and that they still have work to 
do to pave the way for the new leadership, is the whole meaning 
of the political "severe ordeals"--as severe as the 
self-acknowledged failure of the economic plans. 
  Such work is still needed, and the need, along with the 
failure of the economic plans, constitute Pyongyang's current 
political problems. Then, the rhetoric that North Korea 
"defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland," 
and the alleged "victory of the revolutionary line of the party" 
and "great victory of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the 
party and the masses" are all aimed at justifying the measures 
taken at those sessions. It can be said Kim Il-song meant to say 
that the measures primarily resolved the problems. 
  The assertion that North Korea, as a result, "again proved 
that our way of socialism embodying the chuche ideology is an 
invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses of people" 
stresses that Pyongyang will continue to implement similar 
measures and, through them, carry on its present system. This 
does not mean, however, that the domestic political confusion 
was brought under control completely and the basic stability 
regained. 
  Needless to say, what occurred was a rehash of the perennial 
political disarray within the North Korean regime. This can be 
seen in Kim Il-song's confession that "internally and 
externally, our revolution remains in a complex, strained 
situation, and we are building socialism amid a tense 
confrontation with the enemies." 
  While external enemies in the "tense confrontation" could 
mean the pressures on North Korea for its opening to the outside 
world that have continued since the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union and East European communist states, the "internal 
enemies" means political troubles or elements causing domestic 
tensions. 
  Furthermore, still included among the "external enemies" is 
the South Korean government which North Korea views as the 
target of a communist revolution and as a constant threat to its 
system. 
<H5>  Top Priority to Political Groundwork for Complete Succession </H5>
  Therefore, when Kim Il-song stated that "internally and 
externally, our revolution is in a complex and tense situation. 
We are building socialism amid a tense confrontation with the 
enemies," he was laying down a premise for 1994, and it was by 
no means an accident. 
  He said: "...we must further strengthen the nation's 
political, economic and military capabilities to meet the 
demands of the present situation and of the developing 
revolution." As seen here, he was apparently saying, openly, 
that this year again North Korea will put greater emphasis on 
the political groundwork to complete the leadership succession 
than on the economy, and that if a military buildup should be 
the way to do the job, the economy shall be annexed to it. 
  North Korea is, after all, not confronted with a threat or 
possible threat of "war-provocative maneuvers of the enemies." 
Nonetheless, Kim Il-song used such possibilities as a pretext to 
stress that North Korea "must pay attention to strengthening its 
defense capabilities." This explains his position as mentioned 
above. 
  The father-to-son succession is being carried out through 
the 
military. Therefore, by the "war-provocative maneuvers of the 
enemies" he could mean provocations not from outside but from 
within the military, namely, reactions within the military 
against the new leadership, or at least a possible challenge to 
the military from within the political sphere. This cannot be 
ruled out. 
  Kim Il-song emphasized that "we must be fully prepared 
politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially against 
any unforeseeable emergency, and thoroughly establish in the 
whole society the spirit of attaching importance to military 
affairs and giving positive support to the People's Army." This 
could be a warning of such potential forces and possibilities, 
issued to build the public support for the military in paving 
the way to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership. 
<H5>  Economic Policy as Pretense To Divert Attention of Outside </H5>
World 
  Making his rhetoric more specific, Kim Il-song noted: "If we 
are to push ahead forcefully with the revolution and 
construction under the present circumstances, we must firmly 
grasp the guideline of ideological revolution of our party and 
further strengthen the wholehearted unity of the revolutionary 
ranks, giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance." He emphasized: "When all the people unite in one 
mind around the party and the leader, give full play to the 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously, 
we can defend and preserve our way of socialism against any 
difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the 
chuche socialist cause victoriously." And he reiterated: "We 
will defend--as the apple of our eye--the wholehearted unity of 
our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm under the party 
leadership, and we will further consolidate and develop it." 
  These points in the address are indicative of which way Kim 
Il-song will likely take North Korea this year, politically. 
  Despite the present economic crisis, North Korea will 
continue to focus on political programs to prop up the Kim 
Chong-il leadership. It is trying to step up the mobilization of 
people for labor to overcome economic difficulties in the name 
of ideo-political unity, binding them into a united social force 
for a drive to consolidate the new leadership. Such intent is 
seen in the fact that since the beginning of this year, 
Pyongyang has been urging the public to step up the "learn from 
Kim Chong-il" movement while trumpeting the "historical 
inevitability of the victory of socialism," and that it lately 
has frequently used the expression "Kim Chong-il era." 
  Inasmuch as the consolidation of the Kim Chong-il leadership 
continues to be its priority this year, North Korea will likely 
pursue the labor mobilization program along this line as well. 
  The indication is in the address. Kim Il-song said that 
"when 
all the people unite in one mind around the party and the 
leader, give full play to the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously, we can 
defend and preserve our way of socialism against any 
difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the 
chuche socialist cause victoriously." Then, under that premise, 
he noted that "we will defend--as the apple of our eye--the 
wholehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm 
under the party leadership, and will further consolidate and 
develop it." 
  The phrases here such as "defend and preserve our way of 
socialism" and "attain the chuche socialist cause victoriously" 
do not mean a victory as a result of economic development. So, 
when Kim Il-song said that "all the people unite in one mind 
around the party and the leader," he was stressing the need for 
ideo-political unity to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership. 
And when he stressed that the "unity of our revolutionary ranks 
cemented rock-firm under the party leadership" should be 
defended "as the apple of our eye," and that it should be 
further consolidated and developed, he was underscoring the goal 
of that pursuit. 
  From this point of view, one can see that the contradictions 
in the Kim Il-song address--as seen its laying emphasis on a 
trade-first line on the one hand and urging a military buildup 
on the other--and the denunciations of the South unveiling 
Pyongyang's lack of interest in dialogue, have something to do 
with the above-mentioned circumstances surrounding North Korea's 
domestic political situation. 
  When one sees North Korea's trade-first line as a pretense 
to 
divert the attention of the outside world to its domestic 
political situation, he will find how serious the situation is, 
that it is so serious as to require such artifice. As for the 
denunciations of the South, which in effect unveil the lack of 
interest in North-South dialogue, they represent its shopworn 
method fo covering up such grave realities. 
  North Korea, while focusing on domestic political programs 
to 
promote the Kim Chong-il leadership this year, will likely 
continue to use foreign policy issues and North-South issues as 
a bulwark to facilitate its push of such programs, effectively 
combining them as strategic instruments.

<F P=106> [Article by Yim Sang-chol, doctor of agriculture, professor </F>
at the College of Agriculture, Sangji University: "Is It 
Possible To Breathe Life Into North Korea's Agriculture?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
<H5>  North Korea's Agricultural Policy </H5>
  North Korea's agricultural policy may be described very 
briefly as follows: 
  North Korea launched a sweeping land reform program in March 
1946 under the principle of confiscation without compensation 
and free distribution, thereby eliminating the landlord class 
and paving the way for agricultural collectivization in the 
countryside. 
  Agricultural collectivization began in 1954 and was 
completed in 1958. In this period more than 3,800 large-scale 
agricultural cooperatives were organized, resulting in the 
complete elimination of the private ownership of land and means 
of agricultural production. In this process 94 percent of the 
land was converted into cooperative ownership and the remaining 
6 percent into state ownership. North Korea published what they 
call "the Thesis on the Socialist Agrarian Question [in Our 
Country]" in February 1964," setting as the basic goal of its 
agricultural policy to convert cooperative ownership in 
agriculture to "ownership by all the people" . 
  North Korea pushed "four-conversions," namely, rural 
irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and 
chemicalization, as a basic task for the immediate goal of 
eliminating the gaps between agricultural and industrial labor, 
between urban and rural areas, and between farmers and workers. 
As a means of conversion to state ownership, North Korea 
selected areas suitable for collectivization and converted them 
into state-run firms, while expanding existing state firms and 
ranches developed as major agricultural estates producing 
speciality crops, fruit, and livestock, and creating more of 
the similar firms and ranches. A great deal of investment was 
made in these state firms on a priority basis. With emphasis on 
four rural conversions, North Korea introduced the so-called 
"chuche farming method" beginning in the late 1970's, calling 
for the chucheization, scientization, and modernization of 
agriculture. On the other hand, it implemented a five-point 
grand nature harnessing program with dry-field irrigation, 
terraced field development, antierosion work, and marsh-land 
reclamation as its principal content. 
<H5>  Present State of North Korea's Agriculture </H5>
That was a brief overview of North Korea's agricultural policy 
for the past half century. North Korea has pursued its 
agriculture-first policy as part of socialist construction and 
implemented an agricultural policy of its own. However, the 
present condition of North Korea's agriculture is unmistakably 
in bad shape. This may be because forced labor cannot but be 
unproductive where the principle of market economy is brushed 
aside, a common phenomenon and weakness of socialism. The 21st 
Plenum of the Sixth Workers Party of Korea [WPK] Central 
Committee set aside the next three years until 1996 as a buffer 
period in socialist economic construction during which the 
first priority would be given to agriculture, light industry, 
and trade. This may be construed as signifying that North Korea 
is also applying the principle of adaptation, the principle 
that no nation should remain left behind the worldwide trend to 
break away from irrationality and swim with internationalism. 
  The following is a brief examination of the merits and 
demerits of North Korea's major agricultural policies. 
  First, as far as North Korea is concerned, the land reform 
policy and the policy of collectivizing agricultural production 
may be viewed as a considerable success. Supposing economies of 
scale are applicable in the communist system as in the 
democratic system, the policy of collectivization may be viewed 
as a successful one in that is clearly conducive to the 
effective utilization of land. Rearrangement of arable land and 
collectivization, which North Korea considered indispensable as 
a prerequisite to increased soil productivity and agricultural 
mechanization, served as the foundation of mechanization. Let 
us compare this with the situation in the South. In the South it 
is next to impossible to carry out a bold rearrangement of 
arable land for these reasons: Different people own different 
pieces of land, different farmers use different farming methods 
and grow different crops, and there are numerous other problems 
such as those involving compensation. In North Korea on the 
other hand, it seems that they could complete the rearrangement 
of arable land without much difficulty under complete planning. 
  Second, four conversions refers to the four tasks aimed at 
what they call the scientization of the rural economy in North 
Korean, namely, irrigation, electrification, mechanization, and 
chemicalization. 
  By rural irrigation is meant building irrigation facilities 
on arable land. In North Korea almost all paddy fields and over 
50 percent of dry fields are under irrigation. This indicates 
that North Korea has pursued irrigation as the first priority 
task in the development of rural communities. 
  The electrification policy bore a considerable fruit in the 
early stage. However, the current record shows meager success 
as is the case in other industrial sectors, due to the gaping 
disparity between the ever-growing demand for energy and the 
current pace of growth in electricity production. Mechanization 
was essential to farm work in large collective farms. 
Particularly because it was pursued in conjunction with the 
munitions industry, the mechanization policy had much that 
warranted its seeming justification. However, in our judgment 
the policy has been ineffectual because of frequent mechanical 
failures resulting from the backwardness of the technologies 
used, as well as the low operating rates resulting from the 
energy shortage and the lack of enthusiasm to work. 
  With emphasis on chemicalization, North Korea has rapidly 
increased the use of fertilizers while gradually increasing the 
amount of agricultural chemicals sprayed in order to increase 
the per unit output. Agricultural chemicals and fertilizers are 
double-edged swords: When used properly, they are tonic to 
plants, but their overdose can be poisonous. Reportedly, all 
arable land in North Korea has become acidified due to the 
policy of chemicalization, causing a decline in agricultural 
productivity contrary to their expectations. 
  Third, North Korea's grand nature harnessing policy is aimed 
at expanding the acreage of land under cultivation. Seeing the 
necessity of expanding arable land as the first requisite for 
increased agricultural production, North Korea adopted and 
implemented the "five-point policy for the grand nature 
harnessing," namely, dry-field irrigation construction, 
terraced dry-field construction, land rearrangement and soil 
amelioration, anti-erosion projects, and marsh land 
reclamation. Despite its effects in increasing the acreage of 
land under cultivation, this policy may be viewed as typical of 
failed agricultural policies. To expand the acreage of arable 
land which was absolutely in short supply, North Korea 
reclaimed all mountain slopes and converted them into terraced 
fields while converting all land that could be irrigated into 
paddy fields. As a consequence, forests have been devastated 
and soil has been washed away so much that the level of the 
river bottom has risen, increasing the frequency of floods and 
causing severe flood damage to the crops. Apparently, this is an 
outcome of the irrational policy under which in defiance of 
common sense dictating that a mountain is where trees grow and 
a paddy or dry field is where crops grow, they cut trees to 
plant crops and call the patches of land thus created paddies 
and fields. 
  Fourth, the policy of self-reliance is based on the 
socialist 
spirit of attaining self-sufficiency in food and clothing. It 
may be aimed at achieving a self-sufficient economy through the 
socialization of agriculture and the attainment of 
self-sufficiency in food and clothing on the basis of the 
chuche ideology. But clearly, the outcome of such policy has 
been fully demonstrated in the former Soviet Union, China, and 
communist Vietnam. Abandoning their self-pride, these 
countries have made their debut on the international economic 
stage and are now taking an active role among the ranks of free 
trade and international cooperation to achieve leaping 
progress. But in an attempt to increase agricultural efficiency 
for their much-touted purpose of "building an earthly 
paradise," North Korea alone is still resorting to such 
desperate measures as an all-out mobilization of 
non-agricultural labor, including clerical employees of 
factories and enterprises, industrial workers, students, and 
soldiers, in farming during the busy season. The pursuit of an 
arbitrary ineffectual agricultural policy based on what they 
call the chuche farming method, contrary to its original goal 
of breaking the existing impasse by giving hope to the class of 
disgruntled farmers and presenting bright prospects, has proven 
unsuccessful so far in achieving the food production goal, with 
agricultural productivity remaining very low. It is impossible 
to make an accurate assessment of the food production and 
supply situation in North Korea because of the unavailability 
of credible statistics. It is speculated that thanks to its 
agriculture-first policy, North Korea exceeds South Korea in 
terms of the self-sufficiency rate in food grain supply. 
However, compared with South Korea, the variety of foodstuffs 
supplied in North Korea is limited and particularly their 
quality is very poor. This may be attributable to the limits of 
the controlled economy under which the farmers are coerced to 
achieve the government-imposed numerical production goals in the 
absence of incentives for stimulating their desire to produce. 
Up till now our analysts have made pretty much the same 
comparisons between the relative economic strength of the North 
and South by toying with scanty, piece-meal statistics 
available. Comparisons in agricultural production were no 
exception. They often made their comparisons by using figures 
on the output of the staple grain alone as the basis of their 
argument. That is why North Korea overexaggerated the output of 
staple grain by including corn, potatoes, and so on in this 
category besides rice. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Future Prospects </H5>
  In his New Year's message this year, Kim Il-song said: "In 
the domain of the rural economy, we triumphantly executed the 
grand nature harnessing program designed to bring irrigation to 
a high degree of completion, effected a turnaround in 
mechanization and chemicalization, and further developed 
agricultural science and technology to suit the demands of the 
chuche farming method, thereby laying a solid foundation for an 
agricultural revolution that will assure a continual bumper 
crop for ages to come." He added: "We must bring about a new 
turn in the development of the rural economy by waging a 
vigorous struggle to complete the historic tasks outlined in 
the Theses on the Agrarian Question. We must consolidate our 
successes in rural irrigation and electrification, achieve a 
high degree of planning and scientization, and thoroughly 
implement the chuche farming method so that we may increase the 
rice yield and develop all other sectors of agricultural 
production still more. Our working class must produce a greater 
variety of farm machinery and materials, such as tractors and 
trucks, modern farm machines, chemical fertilizers, and 
agricultural chemicals in greater quantities and deliver them to 
our rural villages. Cooperative farmers and all agricultural 
workers must fulfill the party-assigned goals of 
self-sufficiency by doing their farm work meticulously and 
assiduously." 
  As you see, North Korea still resorts pretty much to 
agitating language, but we can hardly see any signs of change 
in North Korea. Nevertheless, their emphasis on agriculture to 
achieve self-sufficiency, the importance attached to heavy 
industry [as published] to achieve qualitative and quantitative 
improvements in the production of daily necessities, their 
professed desire to increase exports by actively searching out 
and mobilizing resources for producing exportable goods and 
develop processing trade--all this may have stemmed from their 
judgment that the situation is so urgent that they have no 
choice but to change in one way or another in this age of 
internationalization. Supposing that assumption is in the realm 
of possibility to a certain extent, the question is: Whom will 
North Korea choose as its major partner? Japan, which is 
extending its hand in a more forthcoming manner than any among 
free countries, is one possible candidate. There is much 
possibility that North Korea will seek active relationships 
with other countries. But North Korea should know that the most 
reliable, stable, and profitable partnership can be obtained 
through the blood relationship between the North and South. 
  Should North Korea's agricultural administration boldly 
approve of private ownership of arable land, it would stimulate 
the desire of the farmers to produce more and spur the 
development of agricultural technology suitable to the 
topographic and climatic conditions in North Korea; and this 
would enable North Korea to produce more from its land that 
would be neatly rearranged, and thus resolve the food shortage 
without difficulty. 
  Unless the current system is boldly revamped, the farmers' 
desire to produce cannot but be passive and lukewarm and their 
productivity will fall more and more with each passing day, 
resulting in a slack and decline in yield in every category of 
cultivation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
expressed regret Tuesday at Washington's placing of Seoul on the 
priority watch list for intellectual property protection 
violations. 
  "We regret that the United States one-sidedly evaluated the 
intellectual property protection situation of its trade partner 
according to its domestic laws, despite international efforts to 
resolve all disputes at the multilateral level before the 
launching of the World Trade Organization (WTO)," Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement. 
  The U.S. Trade Representative placed South Korea on the 
priority watch list on Monday, claiming that Seoul had failed to 
improve its laws on protection of intellectual property rights 
[IPR]. 
  "We want to clarify our government position that we will 
continue to implement the agreements, both bilateral and 
multilateral, on IPR protection," the statement said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- The Kimpo customs office 
on Tuesday sought arrest warrants against a Korean and an 
American man on charges of violating the customs law after they 
tried to smuggle in 400 million won worth of computer chips 
through the U.S. Army Post Office [APO]. 
  The duo were identified as Yi Ho-song, 27, of Togok-tong, 
Kangnam-ku, Seoul: and David Miller, 31, an unemployed, of 
Chori-myon, Paju-kun, Kyonggi Province. The customs office 
apprehended an accomplice, U.S. military civilian John G. 
Booth, 42, and turned him over to U.S. military investigation 
authorities under the Status of Forces Agreement. A customs 
official said that Yi, in collaboration with Miller, brought in 
1,250 486-type computer chips through the APO under the name of 
Mr. Booth on April 17 and 18. The computer chips were purchased 
from the Micro-Tech Co. located in California, U.S., the 
official said.

  [Text] It was learned on 26 April that on 12 April, two 
days before U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's ROK visit, 
the ROK Ministry of National Defense decided to introduce about 
80 billion won worth of U.S. weapons, including anti-artillery 
radar, into the country from 1995, one or two years ahead of the 
original schedule. 
  According to military officials, the MND has decided to 
hasten the purchase of three sorts of weapons demanded by U.S. 
Forces Korea because a budget for buying them has become 
available since adjustments of the Yulgok Project, such as the 
cancellation of the plan to improve the capacity of Phantom 
F-4s, were made as a result of a special inspection into the 
Yulgok Project in March, and because the ROK-based U.S. forces 
have strongly demanded the reinforcement in equipment of the ROK 
Army in preparation for a war since the beginning of this year. 
  The ROK will hasten the purchase of the following weapons 
from the United States at U.S. Forces Korea's request for an 
early purchase of them with the reason of effective joint 
operations: AN-TPQ 37, an anti-artillery radar for detecting 
the enemy's artillery units (58 billion won worth); C-NITE, 
night shooting control equipment attached to Cobra helicopters 
that enables tow missiles to be fired at night (20 billion won 
worth); and a jamming device that disturbs infrared guided 
missiles (2 billion won worth).

  [Text] A pier in Pusan exclusively used free of charge by 
the United States forces here since 13 years ago will be 
returned to the government to be used for export-import cargos. 
  A tentative agreement for the return of the sixth quay was 
reached between the Korea Maritime &amp; Port Administration 
[KMPA] 
and the Eighth U.S. Army authorities recently, a KMPA official 
said yesterday. 
  Consultations for a final decision are underway with the 
U.S. 
State Department and the two sides will begin taking necessary 
procedures after the consultations end. But another pier also 
being used by the U.S. and the Korean naval forces for purely 
military purposes will remain as it is now, he said. 
  U.S. military officials revealed they would return the wharf 
to the Korean government from a positive perspective on 
condition that ships carrying U.S. military materials are 
allowed to use the pier with preferential treatment, he said. 
  The pier, 233-meters long and 25-meters wide, is located 
beside the Pusan Container Terminal Company and has the 
capability of accommodating one 3,000-ton container ship. 
  It was offered to the USFK [U.S. Forces in Korea] in July 
1981 on the basis of the ROK-U.S. Mutual Defense Agreement 
concluded in 1954. 
  The KMPA plans to develop the pier for the exclusive use of 
ships transporting trade freight by investing some 8 billion won 
(10 million U.S. dollars). 
  The KMPA official said the restoration of the wharf is 
expected to inject fresh momentum in attracting cargo going to 
and coming from Russia and China. 
  The KMPA asked the USFK to return the pier via the Defense 
Ministry last September.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The government announced 
Tuesday a plan to liberalize imports of 46 marine products over 
the next three years which will be submitted to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this week. 
  Under the plan, the government will liberalize imports of 
frozen Alaskan pollack fillets from Jan. 1, 1995, those of 
frozen sharks, salted shrimp and three other products from July 
1, 1995, those of frozen Alaskan pollack from Jan. 1, 1996, 
those of frozen sauries and 15 others from July 1, 1996, and 
exports of the remaining 23 items including frozen yellow 
corvinas, eels and hair-tails from July 1, 1997. In addition to 
the scheme, the government has also decided to advance import 
liberalization for angler fish and two others from 1997 to 1995, 
the announcement said. 
  The government has already liberalized imports of 302 of the 
348 marine products and has now decided to free up imports of 
the remaining 46 products in three stages over the 1995-97 
period. 
  South Korea graduated from the GATT balance-of-payments 
clause in October 1989 as its balance of international payments 
went into the black, and promised the GATT that it would 
liberalize imports of 279 farm and marine products between 1992 
and 1997. 
  The government will liberalize imports of all these products 
by July 1, 1997, except for beef and live cattle, agriculture, 
Forestry and Fisheries Ministry officials said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The Korean agricultural 
team has gone on the offensive in trade negotiations. In recent 
talks, Seoul has bluntly told its trading partners to import 
Korean farm products or accept its export conditions, the 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said Tuesday. 
  The ministry held separate quarterly beef talks with 
Australia, New Zealand and the United States this month and 
strongly urged them to carry forward this year's excess import 
volume to the 1995 quota. It reminded them of Seoul's 
concessions to beef exporters in a series of talks and the 
Uruguay Round negotiations and told them it was their turn to 
compromise. 
  In a meeting with visiting Chinese Internal Trade Minister 
Zhang Haoruo on Monday, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries 
Minister Choe In-ki pointed out Korea's growing trade deficit 
with China in the agricultural sector. 
  Korea imported 1,055 million U.S. dollars worth of Chinese 
farm, fisheries and livestock products last year while exports 
only came to 35 million dollars, resulting in a 
1.02-billion-dollar deficit. Seoul reportedly asked Beijing to 
import more Korean processed farm goods, vegetables and apples. 
  Choe, meeting his Canadian counterpart Ralph Goodale last 
Saturday, strongly requested that the North American country 
lift a ban on Korean apples. Goodale, in turn, asked Korea to 
purchase 300,000 tons of feed barley and lower tariffs on rape 
imports. Seoul refused, pointing out that barley was 
inefficient as feed compared with other grains and because Korea 
would nevertheless have to import barley from next year under 
the UR agreement. It also explained that it could not lower the 
tariff on rape because rape farmers on Cheju island would be 
hurt. Canada, the world's largest barley grower, has been 
persistent in trying to sell its products to Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The European Union [EU] 
virtually finalized a decision to halt generalized system of 
preference (GSP) treatment for South Korean fabric goods from 
July 1 until Seoul withdraws its adjustment tariff on foreign 
products, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. Industry 
officials predicted that South Korea stands to lose about 2.6 
million dollars worth of exports to Europe due to the EU measure. 
  The decision, apparently in retaliation for Seoul's 
introduction of an adjustment tariff, needs further approval by 
the EU council before going into effect but this is almost 
certain, the ministry said. 
  The EU commission said April 20 that GSP status had been 
suspended for all South Korean products covered under the 
multi-fiber arrangement (MFA). 
  In January, Seoul introduced a 19-percent adjustment tariff 
on fabric imports for 1994 to minimize the impact on local firms 
caused by an unexpected inflow of foreign products.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The European Union is 
poised to stop granting Generalized System of Preference (GSP) 
status to such South Korean products as consumer electronics, 
cars, semiconductors and footwear, indicating the union no 
longer sees Korea as a developing country. 
  According to a report released by the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corp. (KOTRA) Tuesday, the European Association of Consumer 
Electronics Manufacturers (EACEM) has demanded that the EU 
commission withdraw the GSP status of South Korea, Singapore, 
Taiwan and Hong Kong. The group insists that GSP treatment, 
intended to promote economic progress in developing countries, 
actually benefits only a few advanced developing nations. 
  In a report titled "The effect of GSP on the European 
consumer electronics and lightning apparatus industries," the 
EACEM argued that GSP treatment only enables the advanced 
developing countries to further penetrate the European market, 
KOTRA said. 
  In compliance with the demands of the EACEM and other 
industry members, the EU commission is likely to withdraw 
special treatment for consumer electronics from South Korea and 
other advanced developing countries beginning July 1 when the 
commission announces its GSP policy for 1994, according to the 
KOTRA report. 
  Meanwhile, the European Association of Automobile 
Manufacturers (ACEA), the European Electronic Component 
Manufacturers' Association (EECA) and the European footwear 
industry have joined forces with the EACEM in demanding the 
suspension of GSP status for goods from South Korea and other 
advanced East Asian Countries -- in the form of complaints filed 
with the EU commission over the past months. 
  KOTRA sources believe the EU's move foreshadows a formal 
decision to suspend special treatment for cars, semiconductors 
and footwear from East Asian countries. 
  Officials from KOTRA expect that the new EU policy on GSP 
effective July 1 will include suspension of GSP status for such 
key South Korean exports as textile products, autos, 
semiconductors and footwear. 
  They noted that the associations of various industries, 
which 
asked the EU commission to drop GSP treatment for products from 
advanced developing countries including South Korea, represent 
each industry and are influential enough in Europe to sway 
public opinion. 
  Moreover, Europeans no longer consider South Korea to be a 
developing country, they added.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and 
Japanese military aircraft will not have to be scrambled so 
often after the two nations' defense ministers agreed to provide 
prior notification of their flight schedules, officials at the 
Defense Ministry here said Wednesday. 
  South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and his Japanese 
counterpart Kazuo Aichi agreed Tuesday to prevent confusion in 
identifying planes flying over the open sea by providing advance 
notice of their flight schedules near the zone. 
  They also decided not to scramble their military aircraft in 
principle if the other country's flight schedule for the "air 
defense identification zone" had been reported previously, 
according to the officials. In the past, the two nations' Air 
Forces had to scramble their planes in a bid to prevent foreign 
aircraft from violating their territorial airspace when South 
Korean or Japanese planes flew over the open sea where both have 
air defense "pickets." 
  Frequent scrambling of military aircraft, however, has 
increased the danger of Japan's and Korea's planes clashing or 
firing on each other and become an urgent bilateral issue. 
South Korea first raised the issue when former Japanese Defense 
Minister Yozo Ishikawa visited Seoul in 1990, and since then 
working-level officials from the two nations have held several 
meetings in Seoul and Tokyo. 
  The airspace where both countries have air defense pickets 
is 
below 37 degrees east longitude near the Japanese islands of 
Kyushu and Tsushima, defense officials said. The two nations 
are soon expected to discuss prevention of accidents on the 
basis of the ministers' agreement.

  [Text] It was learned on 27 April that the ROK Government 
is seeking to sign a "ROK-Russian defense-industry technological 
cooperation agreement" (provisional title), which details 
bilateral cooperation necessary for the ROK to introduce defense 
industry equipment and technology. 
  It was also learned that the Foreign and Defense Ministries 
and other pertinent offices had been closely negotiating with 
Russia so President Kim Yong-sam can sign this agreement when he 
visits Russia in early June. 
  Therefore, ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who will be 
arriving in Russia on 28 April, will hold talks with the Russian 
defense minister to extensively discuss the revision of the 
"Memorandum of Understanding on Military Exchange" and the 
signing of the defense industry technological cooperation 
agreement. 
  A ROK foreign minister official said: "Russia's defense 
industry is different from ours in terms of systems and 
technology. Therefore, it is difficult for us to directly 
introduce some Russian equipment and technology." He also said: 
"The scientific and technological level of the Russian defense 
industry is as high as that of the U.S. defense industry. 
Therefore, the Russian defense industry will be very valuable 
to us in the long run because it will contribute to developing 
our defense industry and transferring its technology to private 
industries in the ROK." 
  This official also said: "If the ROK and Russia promote 
technological cooperation in earnest in the defense industry, 
the ROK's practice of introducing military technology mainly 
from the United States will change." 
  Meanwhile, the ROK Government is reportedly examining the 
possibility of paying royalties for Russian technology by 
exempting Russia from repaying some of the principal and 
interest on our economic assistance loans, which Russia has so 
far failed to repay.

<F P=106> ["Moscow Shows Firm Stance Against Pyongyang's Nuclear </F>
Ambitions"--YONHAP headline] 
  [Text] Moscow, April 30 (YONHAP) -- With South Korean 
Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae's ongoing visit to Moscow helping 
to cement bilateral military ties, Seoul seems satisfied with 
the results of a meeting Friday between Yi and his Russian 
counterpart Pavel Grachev that showed Russia's firm opposition 
to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. 
  The fact that the two ministers discussed expanding 
bilateral 
military cooperation and the North Korean nuclear issue alone 
deserves attention, Western diplomats here say. 
  Pyongyang, which still maintains a military alliance with 
Moscow, will likely feel pressure from the meeting where it was 
agreed that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons program must 
be stopped because it could threaten world peace as well as 
security in Northeast Asia. 
  Yi, the first South Korean defense minister to visit Moscow, 
said the meeting has paved the way for enhanced military links 
between the two countries. 
  Seoul and Moscow maintained unofficial military ties before 
1992, when Grachev and his South Korean counterpart signed an 
accord on bilateral military relations. Grachev, at the time, 
was accompanying Russian President Boris Yeltsin to Seoul for a 
summit meeting. 
  In line with the accord, Yi Yang-ho, chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, visited Moscow and naval ships from the two 
countries made friendly return calls last year. 
  The accord signed Friday, the second of its kind, calls for 
only two exchanges of military personnel, giving the impression 
that it carries no more importance than the 1992 pact. 
  Military experts, however, view the second accord as being 
considerably more important because it calls for visits to Seoul 
by Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff, and Defense 
Minister Grachev this fall and next year, respectively. 
  During Friday's meeting, the two ministers agreed on another 
treaty which calls for the two navies to provide ships to rescue 
stranded vessels from their countries. The treaty will be 
signed formally in early June when South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam makes a state visit to Russia. 
  Meanwhile, Moscow seems intent on maintaining military ties 
"to a certain extent" with Pyongyang, its traditional communist 
ally since the era of the former Soviet Union, in an effort to 
retain some influence over Pyongyang. A senior official from 
the Russian Defense Ministry visited Pyongyang last December to 
sign a memorandum on bilateral military exchanges, demonstrating 
Moscow's desire to maintain defense ties with Pyongyang, western 
diplomats said. Moreover, a group within the Russian military 
is still calling for an undiluted relationship with the 
kremlin's old ally. 
  They also argue that Moscow wishes to preserve and improve 
diplomatic, economic and military ties with Pyongyang, which 
have been strained since it normalized relations with Seoul. In 
their view, Moscow is apparently trying to strike a balance 
between Seoul and Pyongyang. 
  However, it was a surprise that South Korean Defense 
Minister 
Yi told reporters that the meeting's agenda did not include the 
purchase of Russian weapons and the transfer of arms production 
technology. Yi's remark was unexpected given that Moscow has 
already delivered to Seoul a list of state-of-the-art Russian 
arms that could be provided to repay past South Korean loans. 
  Moscow has also taken an aggressive line toward establishing 
a South Korea-Russia joint venture to produce arms with Russian 
technology and South Korean capital and marketing expertise. 
  Military experts believe the Korean side did not want to 
address the issues of arms joint ventures and Russian weapons 
transfers in exchange for loans, even though the Russians wanted 
to discuss the matters. Instead, the issues can be dealt with 
during a meeting of the Korea-Russia Economic Cooperation 
Committee slated for May, they say.

<F P=106> [Article by Moscow-based correspondent Mun Myong-ho from the </F>
"Reporter's Eye" column] 
  [Text] "We had no time to discuss the defense industry 
cooperation at all," was the remark to the ROK correspondents in 
Moscow by the ROK Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae emerging from 
his talks with the Russian Defense Minister Grachev held at the 
Russian Defense Ministry building on the morning of 29 April. 
Defense Minister Yi also said that the ROK purchase of Russian 
weaponry was not discussed. 
  The ROK had a lot of expectations on the talks on the issue 
of defense industry technological cooperation. The Russian side 
was also reported to have expected the ROK to show a minimum 
positive response to the issue of purchasing Russian weaponry. 
However, neither side scored any gains in what it had hoped for. 
  Meanwhile, the ROK Defense Ministry source released a report 
in Seoul at about the same time saying that the defense 
ministers of the two countries agreed at the talks on that day 
that the two countries would build a system for assistance in 
defense industry technological cooperation. Since this was not 
a slight difference between the two reports over the same fact 
that could occur in the course of conveying the report, it 
should not be regarded as a communication error. One of the two 
must have lied, exaggerated, or concealed the truth. 
  Noteworthy is the fact that an incident of this nature 
occurred again two weeks after a similar one regarding ROK 
relations with Russia. 
  The report released by the ROK Foreign Ministry immediately 
after ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu had talks with Russian 
Foreign Minister Kozyrev in Moscow on 14 April was that Russia 
agreed to actively cooperate with the ROK on the problem of the 
North Koreans escaping from the logging site in the Russian Far 
East. The truth, as it turned out later, was that Russia only 
reconfirmed its previous principled position. 
  ROK Embassy officials in Moscow are very embarrassed at the 
reports which are openly released in this manner distorting the 
fact and interpreting everything to one's own advantage. 
  We worry about the possible tendency in the government to 
have an illusion that Russia may accede to our demands easily 
because of its deteriorated prestige and debt to the ROK, or to 
think lightly of Russia. We should prevent a recurrence of an 
incident in which the people are fooled and the country loses 
face by pretending that there was success when there was no 
success.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia 
have initiated a new aviation agreement superseding the existing 
one, the Foreign Ministry announced over the weekend. The pact, 
resulting from the bilateral talks held here Thursday and 
Friday, stipulates for a reduced scope of matters for 
negotiations between airlines and new airport fees. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister for Trade Affairs Kim Kwang-tong 
initiated the pact for Korea and acting Aviation Director 
Tumanov of the Transportation Ministry for Russia. The 
agreement will be formally concluded after the two countries 
take necessary steps. The two countries have also agreed to 
proceed with government- and private-level negotiations about 
air routes between them, including the trans-Siberian routes.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean deep-sea 
fishing industry is being threatened by fishermen from the 
former Soviet Union and their cheap catches, the Korea Maritime 
and Port Administration (KMTA) said Monday. 
  A KMTA report said that in the fishing grounds of New 
Zealand, Tahiti and Australia, former Soviet fishermen are 
making inroads into major areas and selling their catch at half 
the price charged by their Korean counterparts thanks to low 
labor costs. Fishermen from the former communist bloc earn less 
than 100 U.S. dollars a month, under one-14th the starting 
salary of 1,400 dollars for Koreans. Captains from the former 
Soviet Union are paid no more than 150 dollars, even less than 
the montly 500-dollar pay of Indonesian fishermen. 
  In order to increase their catch and save costs, Korean 
fishing boats have decided not to return to port unless bad 
weather or ship problems arise. To save docking time, they are 
being supplied with food and drink by freight boats, a KMTA 
official said. 
  Adding to their problems, Korean fishing vessels will likely 
find it difficult to gain longer periods at sea from bases like 
New Zealand, which are demanding that their nationals be 
employed as sailors. Koreans prefer not to employ them, 
however, as they refuse to work longer hours. Four Korean 
fishing companies operate in New Zealand and 10 in tahiti. 
Industry sources predict encroachment by fishermen from the 
former Soviet Union in other areas like Spain as well. 
  Japanese fishermen, hit by declining profitability caused by 
high labor costs, are selling their ships and returning home.

  [Text] Pusan, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Chinese patrol boats 
seized two South Korean dragnet fishing boats and took away one 
boat and 22 fishermen on Friday. 
  When the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, 98 tons, was under repairs in 
the seas about 220 miles southwest of Cheju Island around noon, 
a Chinese patrol boat seized it and whisked its Skipper Sin 
Hyon-pok, 43, and 10 fishermen to the patrol boat to tow the 
empty boat to China, the No. 1 Songgwang-ho, a sister boat of 
the seized one, cabled to the Pusan Marine Police Saturday. 
  The Chinese boat gave up the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, cutting the 
rope, when the sister boat chased it, the cable said. 
  Another Chinese boat also seized and took away the No. 27 
Taehung-ho, 123 tons, with 11 crewmen, including Skipper Pak 
Hong-yang, 40, aboard, in the open seas 175 miles southwest of 
Cheju Island about the same time when it was adrift owing to 
engine trouble, according to the Pusan Marine Police. 
  Although the No. 2 Songgwang-ho was caught in an area 
believed to be China's territorial waters, the No. 27 
Taehung-ho was seized in open seas and this is expected to cause 
a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing, the police said.

  [Text] Pusan, May 3 (YONHAP) -- A local Chinese Fishery 
Office continues to hold 22 South Korean fishermen as hostages 
in its attempt to obtain money from Korea. 
  An official at the Taeyang Fishery Co. here, to which part 
of the captured fishermen belong, said Tuesday the Fishery 
Administration Office in Luxi, Jiangxi Province of China was 
demanding money in return for the release of the fishermen 
without reporting the case to higher authorities. 
  Eleven of the 22 fishermen being unlawfully held in Luxi 
were 
the crew members of Taehung-ho No. 27 caught by a Chinese patrol 
boat in the high seas 175 miles southwest of Cheju-do last April 
29. The 11 others were the crews of Songkwang-ho No. 2 also 
seized by a Chinese patrol vessel the same day roughly in the 
same area. 
  The official said a message from Taehung-ho No. 28, a sister 
boat of the seized Taehung-ho No. 27, indicated that the Luxi 
Fishery Office forced the hostages to tell Taehung-ho No. 28 in 
telex to go back to Korea and bring 50,000 dollars. 
  Chinese officials threaten that unless the money is given to 
them, they would handle the captured fishermen according to law, 
the official said. 
  Luxi fishery office people even intimidate the hostages into 
surrendering all the money they have, he said. 
  Taehung-ho No. 28 which was near the scene of the seizure, 
followed the Chinese patrol boat carrying the captured fishermen 
all the way to just outside the territorial waters of China and 
has been staying there. 
  The Luxi fishery office was making a similar demand toward 
the 11 fishermen of Songkwang-ho No. 2, a source said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- China may officially 
open its doors to South Korean motor vehicles as early as July 
or August, sources at the Korea Automobile Manufacturers 
Association (KAMA) said Tuesday. The Chinese have presented to 
Korea a proposal on joint manufacture of 25 auto parts including 
fuel systems, bearings and ABS (Anti-lock Brake System) and they 
are currently discussing the matter, the sources said. 
  Liu Keming, vice president of the China National Automobile 
Import and Export Corp., will visit Seoul around June and decide 
on whether to approve Korean car imports after touring 
automaking and car parts manufacturing sites here. 
  A KAMA official, who recently attended the working-level 
meeting of the Korea-China Automobile Industry Association 
conference held annually in rotation, said Liu would be bringing 
a blueprint on how many cars China intends to import. He said 
it was "a matter of time" before Korean cars make inroads into 
China as the latter is coming around to the idea, predicting 
July or August after Liu returns from his tour and winds up the 
necessary procedures. 
  Beijing lifted its ban on car imports to some extent last 
year by formally allowing in 16,000 American autos and 
unofficially approving 8,200 Korean cars made by Daewoo Motor 
Co. The automobile industry associations of the two countries 
agreed to hold the first joint conference in Beijing or 
Changchun from Sept. 12-16 during the last working-level meeting 
April 13-16. China is expected to spell out its policy on 
Korean motor vehicle imports, including ways to promote 
investment in the completed car and auto parts industry and 
cooperation in parts at the joint conference.

  [Text] South Korea will set up a consulate general in the 
Chinese port city of Qingdao by the end of September this year 
at the latest, a Foreign Ministry official said yesterday. He 
said two officials at the ministry will be sent to Qingdao in 
mid-May for preparatory works, which will take three of four 
months. 
  In addition to dealing with usual consular affairs, the new 
consulate general will support Korean companies engaged in 
business in Shandong Province surrounding Qingdao, said the 
official. He added more Korean firms have advanced into 
Shandong than any other Chinese province. 
  Seoul, which formalized diplomatic ties with Beijing in 
August 1991, now has one consulate general in Shanghai. The 
official said the government will push to set up several more 
consulates general in other key cities in China.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (YONHAP) -- Argentine Navy 
vessels seized four South Korean fishing ships near the Falkland 
islands Tuesday afternoon. The four Korean ships, 300-400 ton 
large, are Petro 301 and Petro 303 of Taeung Deep Sea Fisheries 
Co., Tongwon 311 of Tongwon Industries Co. and Chaewon 22 of 
Chaewon Industrial Co. 
  The vessels, fishing within 200 nautical miles of 
Argentina's 
"territorial waters," tried to escape after the Argentine Navy 
ordered them to stop but were later captured, Argentine 
authorities said. Korean fishing sources here said four Korean 
vessels are confirmed to have been captured, but the figure may 
rise to seven. The incident marks the first time that the 
Argentine Navy, instead of the Coast Guard, has seized several 
Korean ships at a time for entering the zone and could cause a 
diplomatic dispute, informed sources said. 
  The Korean ships' catch will be confiscated and they face a 
fine of at least 500,000 U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, April 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korean 
fishing companies have been on their toes ever since four Korean 
vessels were seized recently by Argentine naval authorities. 
The fishing business here for South Korean companies, which 
goes back to the late 1970s when Hansong Enterprise Co. first 
took to the water, witnessed its worst group seizure ever. 
  All four vessels are operated by locally incorporated South 
Korean companies -- two by Tae Ung Deep Sea Fisheries Co., one 
by Tongwon Industries Co. And the last by Chewon Co. These 
locally incorporated firms own a total of 34 vessels, all flying 
Argentinian flags and obligated to follow local regulations, 
prompting South Korean officials to question why they were 
seized by Argentine authorities. 
  The captured boats were operating about 300 miles north of 
the Falkland Islands. The fishermen say they were taken 
illegally, insisting they were outside Argentina's territorial 
waters. Local authorities, however, say the boats were inside 
the 200-mile territorial limit, fishing 195 to 197 miles off the 
coast. 
  Bickering over whether a vessel is operating inside or 
outside the boundary is common: Most boats fishing illegally 
inside Argentine territorial waters speed beyond the boundary 
when chased by maritime authorities and claim they were fishing 
at the point of capture. But officials here say this time, the 
maritime police started from outside the boundary and gradually 
worked to the inside, discrediting the South Koreans' claims. 
  Argentina's federal courts will have to decide who is right, 
and most observers say South Korea is aboard a sinking ship. 
History shows that virtually no vessels accused of illegal 
fishing were set free without paying at least a minimal fine. 
The federal courts usually take at least three months to 
investigate before setting a fine. Depending on whether the 
courts see the violation as premeditated or unplanned, the fine 
could range from 490,000 U.S. dollars to as high as 1 million 
dollars. Because four boats were caught at once, the courts are 
most likely to view it as a planned violation, the officials say. 
  Over 500 boats operate in the teeming waters off Argentina 
in 
March and April including 50 Russian and 150 South Korean 
vessels, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese boats and those 
locally incorporated. 
  The officials say Argentina's fierce reaction to boundary 
violations is understandable given that so many foreign vessels 
cross the line to net squid and shrimp whenever the authorities' 
watchful eye is averted.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government 
welcomed the conclusion of free elections in South Africa [RSA] 
Tuesday and looked forward to stronger bilateral relations after 
the end of apartheid. 
  South Korea "commends the firm determination and efforts of 
South African leaders, both black and white, who have wisely 
overcome the long disharmony between the races and have made 
this election a reality," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho. 
  "Furthermore, the Government of the Republic of Korea is of 
the view that the present elections provide historic momentum 
for bringing about an end to the 342-year legacy of minority 
white rule over the majority black population, and the regime of 
apartheid," he said. 
  South Korea "looks forward to further strengthening the 
already existing friendly relations between our two countries 
through the momentum created by the free elections in South 
Africa," Chang said. 
  Seoul and Pretoria established diplomatic ties in December 
1992.

  [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Saudi 
Arabia agreed to conclude pacts on investment guarantees and 
avoidance of double taxation at a joint committee session this 
week in Seoul, the Foreign Ministry said Friday. The two 
countries also promised to cooperate in improving conditions for 
South Korean construction companies operating in Saudi Arabia, 
the Ministry said. The committee, the 10th of its kind, was 
convened after a five-year hiatus. 
  Seoul officials captured Riyadh's interest with proposals to 
jointly bid for construction contracts in third countries and 
for South Korea to participate in the Saudis' railroad-building 
project. Saudi Arabia, in return, asked for more private-level 
economic cooperation suited to the changing political situation 
in the Middle East after the Gulf War, the drop in international 
oil prices and the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. 
  South Korea registered 3.73 billion U.S. dollars in imports 
from Saudi Arabia last year, mostly crude oil, and posted 
exports of 940 million dollars. Although a heavy imbalance may 
be inevitable due to oil purchases, officials said they want to 
rectify it as much as possible -- through a more active advance 
into the Saudi construction market, for example. Officials said 
the two sides agreed to work on expanding bilateral 
import-export activities.

  [Text] Seoul, April 20 (YONHAP) -- The export-import [Exim] 
Bank of Korea will offer relending worth 10 million U.S. dollars 
to Vietcom Bank to facilitate Korean exports to Vietnam. Exim 
Bank Governor Chae Hong-sik and Vietcom Bank Vice President Ha 
Hui-song signed a contract Wednesday for the relending service 
covering three to 10 years and carrying annual interest rates of 
about 6 percent. Under Korea's first subleasing service to the 
Indochinese country, Vietnamese firms importing Korean 
industrial products will be able to borrow money from Vietcom 
with the Exim Bank funds at interest rates running around 7 
percent. Including its facility to Vietcom, Exim Bank extends 
relending to 26 foreign financial institutes worth 264 million 
dollars.

<F P=106> [Article by reporter Kim Chin-wan on interview with newly </F>
appointed Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok in Seoul on 30 April] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok was interviewed by 
reporters immediately after his inaugural ceremony at the Grand 
Assembly Hall of the main government complex in Seoul on 30 
April, in which he repeatedly stressed harmony. He said, 
"Harmony is important not only among the cabinet members. I 
will see to it that state affairs are managed through our 
exchange of views with as many personages as possible from 
Chongwadae [presidential office] staff, outside figures, and 
those in the journalist circles." 
  He made an extra effort to deny his image as a 
`conservative' 
and said, "The proof that any person or a group is alive is that 
such a person or a group is supported by his or its effort for 
change and reform," thus introducing himself to be a reasonable 
realist in pursuit of change and reform. 
  The following is a compilation of the questions and answers 
in the interview. 
  [Kim Chin-wan] As deputy prime minister of unification, you 
chaired the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating 
Committee meeting. Will you be standing aloof from the meeting 
as prime minister? 
  [Yi Yong-tok] The Unification and Security Policy 
Coordinating Committee meeting is supposed to be chaired by the 
deputy prime minister according to the presidential order. I 
think this is sufficient. I will involve myself in it as prime 
minister only upon request. 
  [Kim] The former prime minister instructed that the agenda 
of the Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Committee 
meeting should be reported to the prime minister. Are you 
revoking this instruction? 
  [Yi] When I was deputy prime minister, I did not neglect 
reporting to the prime minister on it even before the 
instruction was issued. Irrespective of an instruction, 
reporting to each other and exchanging views with each other for 
the sake of harmony will help bring forth smooth operation. 
  [Kim] What is your opinion of the worries about the 
weakening of the prime minister's office? 
  [Yi] I do not think so. I do not know legal affairs much, 
but the prime minister is supposed to control the cabinet 
receiving orders from the president. 
  I will see to it that things are pushed forward vigorously, 
taking care that self-control and creativity are respected. 
Harmony among the departments is important. 
  [Kim] What will be the nature of the third cabinet? 
  [Yi] It is a cabinet of reform in harmony. 
  [Kim] What is your feeling about the stormy passage through 
parliamentary ratification? 
  [Yi] It is not appropriate that an official from the 
government should comment on what happened in the National 
Assembly. The conflict between groups will last longer than the 
conflict between individuals. I personally feel that the past 
one week was a very memorable period of time. 
  [Kim] Do you not have a plan to maintain the present senior 
officials of the prime minister's office for the sake of harmony? 
  [Yi] (Looking to the senior secretary and the administrative 
coordinating director of the prime minister's office) What 
shall we do? I have these two dependable aides. I should 
continue getting help from these two gentlemen, shouldn't I? 
(laughter). 
  [Kim] What is your opinion of the ethos of the present 
government officials? Are they excessively passive? If so, 
what are the measures to overcome this situation? 
  [Yi] I do not think so. I think the government officials 
have firm resolve to carry out state affairs, though the degree 
of the resolve may vary between individuals. However, the 
reestablishment of official discipline may be necessary. 
Reestablishing official discipline, we ought to boost their 
morale at the same time. What is needed here is self-control.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- A sense of stability 
returned to the presidential office Saturday when the country's 
national security and foreign affairs team was finally made 
complete with the appointment of a new prime minister and deputy 
premier-unification minister. 
  Reflecting this feeling, President Kim sat down with his two 
new ministers after formally appointing them to their posts. 
  "I knew I would have the chance to work with Vice Prime 
Minister Yi some day," the president was quoted as saying to his 
Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. 
  "That time has come," Kim said. 
  New Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok joked that the position of 
vice premier-unification minister is "not easy." 
  Yi Hong-ku, on the other hand, had soccer on his mind. He 
worried openly that his change of jobs might jeopardize Seoul's 
chances of winning the right to host the 2002 World Cup soccer 
finals. 
  "Personal relationships decide the successful bid for 
becoming host. I am concerned because the chance of winning the 
bid is getting higher now," Yi said. 
  -- The opposition Democratic Party welcomed Yi Hong-ku's 
appointment but withheld a statement because of its 
confrontation with the ruling party in the process of approving 
the prime minister. 
  "We make a statement by not making a statement instead," 
party spokesman Pak Chae-won said. "But I personally think it 
was a good choice." 
  The Supreme Council's Kim Won-ki called the new unification 
minister a man "of experience and learning" while Rep. Mun 
Hi-sang described him as an expert on unification affairs, 
suited to leading Seoul's North Korea policy in the right 
direction. 
  The ruling Democratic Liberal Party loudly welcomed Yi's 
appointment as unification minister, calling it "appropriate" 
and Yi "the right person." 
  Rep. Yi Se-ki, chairman of the Party Policy Committee, 
reminded that Yi was excellent as a college professor, highly 
valued during his days as unification minister and effective as 
ambassador to Britain. 
  He saw Yi as moderate and possessed of a long-range vision 
in 
North Korea policies and predicted smooth sailing in cooperation 
with the party. 
  Secretary-General Yi Han-tong praised the deputy premier as 
a 
man of "goodwill and benevolence." 
  The ruling camp had another reason to be happy -- the fact 
that the cabinet shake-up was much smaller in scale than feared. 
  Speculation once abounded that President Kim would change 
his 
diplomatic policy team and shake up the party leadership. "Now 
it's been proven that there was no need to reshuffle the party," 
one official said with relief.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Daewoo Shipbuilding and 
Heavy Machinery, Ltd. delivered the nation's first submarine 
"Ichon" to the Navy in a ceremony held at the company's Okpo 
Shipyard near Pusan over the weekend, with chief of naval 
operations Adm. Kim Hong-yol, Daewoo Vice Chairman Yun Yong-sok 
and many other Navy and company officials attending, the company 
announced. 
  The diesel engine-powered T-209-class submarine is armed 
with 
torpedoes and depth charges and can conduct independent 
operations for two months with a crew of 30. 
  It can cruise at a maximum speed of 22 knots (40 kilometers 
per hour), compared with North Korea's Whiskey- and Romeo-class 
submarines cruising at 12 to 14 knots, the announcement said. 
  Daewoo started construction of the warship in November 1989, 
using designs and technology of Germany's HDW, and completed it 
in October 1992. The ship had been successfully test-operated 
before the delivery to the Navy.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Twenty-two, or 60 percent, 
of the 38 central government agencies have undergone 
streamlining to honor the pledge of a "small government" made in 
January. At a meeting Monday presided over by Prime Minister Yi 
Yong-tok, the cabinet confirmed that 1,368 officials have been 
cut while 829 have been newly employed, resulting in a net 
reduction of 539 officials. One office, three bureaus, 11 
councilor posts and 35 divisions have been closed down. Of the 
remaining 16 agencies, four agencies are awaiting approval for a 
manpower increase while 12 others, including the National 
Unification Board, have yet to submit reorganization drafts. 
  The government streamlining is therefore virtually finalized 
as the rest of the reshaping is likely to be small in scale. Of 
the 22 agencies that have finished their restructuring, the 
Communications Ministry did the most cutting -- 223 officials -- 
followed by 115 in the Korea National Railroad, 105 in the 
Construction Ministry, 55 in the Home Ministry, 52 in the 
Foreign Ministry, 43 in the Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry, 
and 23 in the Government Administration Ministry. 
  In contrast, the Environment Ministry added 223 officials to 
perform its new task of handling water-related affairs and the 
public prosecutor's office employed seven.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- The government has decided 
to promote 12 selected projects on a priority basis to better 
facilitate the internationalization of the nation's economy 
under the new world economic order. To this end, an "Economic 
Internationalization Planning Corps" will set sail at the 
Economic Planning Board shortly. It will be headed by the vice 
economic planning minister. 
  The 12 projects disclosed by Deputy Prime Minister Chong 
Chae-sok in a press conference Monday included a 21st century 
economic strategy, preparation for joining the OECD, improvement 
of banking system and rural development programs. 
  They also included the refixing of industrial policy 
direction, change in a small industry support policy, expedition 
of key technology development, and overseas advancement strategy. 
  The selected projects in the industrial support sector were 
elevated competitiveness of logistics industry, efficient 
manpower demand and supply program, effective handling of 
tightened international environmental control, and expanded 
participation in international organizations. 
  In addition, the government has resolved to give exceptional 
promotion to those public officials working hard, and organize 
inter-ministry mid-echelon officials meetings to remove what is 
called "ministry selfishness." 
  Public officials will also be accorded more opportunities 
for 
overseas observation or training tours in a policy to help them 
have a better understanding of the abroad and to enhance their 
morale. 
  In another step, the deputy prime minister and 10 other 
economy-related ministers will tour major local industrial areas 
in the coming two months to grasp a more correct picture of the 
field industrial situation. 
  Deputy Premier Chong, for instance, is set to visit the 
industrial estates in Kwangyang and Changwon and nearby rural 
areas this month.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance said it will sell a 
government-owned 72.6 percent stake of Citizens National Bank 
[CNB] from November on a gradual basis in its first step to 
privatize state-run banks. Before selling the government-owned 
shares, the ministry will allow the CNB to increase its capital 
by 20 billion won by way of making it go public and listing it 
on the Korea Stock Exchange in August. But even after the 
privatization of the CNB, it said the CNB's function to support 
small- and medium-sized firms will continue. CNB's paid-in 
capital is 191 billion won and its equity capital amounted to 
406.4 billion won as of the end of 1993. 
  It also plans to sell the government-owned 1.6 percent stake 
of Korea Exchange Bank [KEB] this year and the Bank of 
Korea-owned shares will be sold some time during 1994-1995. Out 
of KEB's total paid-in capital worth 605 billion won, 65.3 
percent is held by the central bank [Bank of Korea]. KEB's 
equity capital amounted to 1.6 trillion won as of the end of 
1993. 
  Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Korea Housing Bank (KHB) 
will also be privatized sometime during 1996-1997, it said. 
  The ministry said it will privatize first those banks which 
have the most similar characteristics with commercial banks. 
The ministry's move to privatize state-run banks is part of its 
policy to exempt commercial banks from extending 
government-supported policy loans and make specialized banks 
exclusively deal with the policy loans in the long-run.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>
  [Text] In a warm-up process for Korea's full-fledged 
opening of the 140 billion dollar bond market, the Ministry of 
Finance announced yesterday that from July 1, foreigners will be 
able to buy non-guaranteed convertible bonds [CBs] issued by 
small- and medium-sized companies listed on the Korea Stock 
Exchange as well as long-term state and public bonds of which 
yields are similar to international rates. The ministry said 
that the combined foreign purchase of these CBs will be set at 
30 percent and individual foreigners can buy up to 5 percent of 
a single company CBs. 
  Like stock investment, foreigners seeking to buy Korean 
bonds 
must open an account at foreign exchange banks and securities 
companies and get an investment registration card from the 
regulators. 
  Even if foreigners have been issued an investment 
registration card from Korean regulators for their stock 
investment in Seoul stocks, they must separately get a card from 
them for bond investment, the ministry said. 
  Foreigners can theoretically invest in both stocks and bonds 
simultaneously from July 1. Foreigners must trade these stocks 
only through the Korea Stock Exchange. But 98 percent of all 
Korean bonds are traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. 
They must sell their Korean bonds only to Koreans. Trading 
among foreigners outside the exchange is prohibited, the MOF 
said. 
  CBs issued only by small-and medium-sized firms listed on 
the 
Korea Stock Exchange without payment guarantee from financial 
institutions will be available to foreigners. These CBs are 
regarded as the most risky, unattractive and illiquid of all 
bonds available here. 
  Non-Koreans can also buy state and public bonds that are 
designated by the Securities Supervisory Board. The maturity of 
these bonds is more than five years. They can not buy state and 
public bonds unless the issuers make formal request to the 
regulators. 
  All bonds foreigners buy must be kept at the Korea 
Securities 
Depositories, a semi-state agency which is in charge of 
safekeeping all kinds of marketable securities, until they sell 
them to Koreans. 
  Foreigners can freely remit investment money and income 
accruing from their bond investments in Korea. But the 
government retains the right to restrict the cash remittance 
exceptionally in emergency cases, which may not take place, 
ministry officials said. 
  Foreigners who buy CBs issued by small businesses will be 
fully guaranteed to convert them into underlying equities at the 
conversion date, the MOF said. But they will be told to sell 
part of their holdings if the aggregate foreign stock ownership 
exceeds 15 percent. Foreigners holding more than 3 percent of 
any listed company will be told immediately to sell their 
beyond-ceiling portion, it said. 
  Under the limited market-opening steps, foreigners can buy 
6.9 billion won worth of CBs issued by small-and medium-sized 
firms and they can initially buy 10 billion won worth of public 
bonds in September, which are issued by the Chollanam-to 
province to finance its container yard construction. 
  The amount is quite a peanut of Korea's 140 billion dollar 
bond market, a Western broker here said. He and other foreign 
brokers said Korea initially put on sale "rotten vegetables" 
unattractive to Koreans. Fresh vegetables (guaranteed bonds 
with higher return) will be off-limit to foreigners for the time 
being. 
  Korea opened 10 percent of the stock market and announced 
the 
initial opening of less than 0.02 percent of the bond market. 
The stock market (120 trillion won in market capitalization) is 
larger than the bond market (111 trillion won). 
  But they added that it is meaningful that Korea finally 
starts to open its bond market although they do not know when 
additional bond- market openings will be made. 
  The government has a justifiable reason to be cautious in 
the 
opening of the bond market because of wide differences in 
interest rates between home and abroad, government officials and 
even many foreign bankers here said. 
  A full-scale opening will result in an influx of huge 
amounts 
of foreign capital, which will jeopardize the nation's monetary, 
foreign exchange and macroeconomic management, a Ministry of 
Finance official said. 
  The government has not specified when and to what extent the 
bond market-opening will be made additionally. But many 
analysts here view that the bond market-opening will be made 
only after the domestic interest rates fall to the significant 
level and the nation's foreign exchange and capital flow 
restrictions are set free, possibly after 1997.

  [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Bank of Korea Governor 
Kim Myong-ho estimated Saturday the first-quarter growth of the 
economy at above 8.5 percent. Kim said in a press conference 
before his departure for Manila to attend the annual Asian 
Development Bank meeting that the economic growth in the 
January-March period was estimated to be more than 8.5 percent, 
thanks to increased exports and capital investment in all 
sectors except agriculture, though the estimate was not based on 
accurate data. 
  Kim's estimate is compared with the 8.3-percent growth 
estimated by the Korea Development Institute, indicating that 
the economy will grow 8 percent this year against the Bank of 
Korea's earlier projection of 6.3 percent. 
  It is too early to say that the economy is overheating 
because the economy is not yet showing such signs of overheating 
as supply shortages and rapid wage hikes. But the economy has 
entered an expansion period after a recovery from the recession, 
he observed. 
  Commenting on the current-account deficit of 2.5 billion 
U.S. 
dollars recorded in the first quarter, he said, "When the 
economy is recovering or expanding, imports are usually greater 
than exports chiefly because of the rapidly increasing demand 
for imported equipment and machinery. So, the deficit is a 
temporary phenomenon and I think it will not last long until the 
end of the year." 
  Kim said there would be no revision of the money supply 
growth goal of 14-17 percent for this year because the financial 
situation is so good that such revision is not needed.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- Wage negotiations have 
been settled at South Korean industries at a rapider pace so far 
this year than last year. 
  According to the Labor Affairs Ministry, 812 firms or 14.8 
percent of the total 5,483 companies employing more than 100 
workers have concluded labor-management wage negotiations as of 
Tuesday. The percentage represented an increase of 3.2 
percentage points over the same period of last year. 
  A Ministry official said the faster settlement was 
attributable to the fact that a central labor-management wage 
agreement came earlier than last year, and many industries had 
affirmatively accepted the wage agreement. The wage hikes 
agreed on thus far averaged at 5.3 percent, which compares with 
the average 5.2 percent of last year. By area, service firms 
topped the list with 24.1 percent followed by electricity, gas 
and water works (22.7 percent), transportation, warehouse and 
communications (20.5 percent), manufacturing (12.1 percent), 
construction (10.9 percent) and financing and insurance (5.1 
percent).

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Myong-chol] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- Labor-management relations 
have improved greatly from last year thanks to expanding mutual 
trust, an increasing consensus on the need to sharpen Korean 
products' competitive edge and dissident unions' restraint on 
forming a second labor front independent of the Federation of 
Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). Moreover, labor disputes are on the 
decrease and collective bargaining on wage hikes is sailing 
before the wind. 
  According to the Labor Ministry, 20 labor disputes have been 
recorded so far this year compared with 18 during the same 
period last year. Noteworthy is that the manufacturing sector 
saw only five disputes against 13 last year, while the remainder 
involved small taxi companies. 
  Employees participating in these disputes decreased from 
12,712 last year to 4,739 and working hours lost to the disputes 
amounted to 20,520 hours, only 15 percent of the figure 
registered a year ago. 
  Of the 5,483 firms employing 100 or more workers, 918 or 
16.7 
percent had completed collective bargaining on wage hikes as of 
May 3. Last year, the same 16.7-percent rate was achieved May 
11. 
  The improved labor-management relations and the resulting 
smooth sailing of collective bargaining are attributed chiefly 
to an increasing worker-employer consensus on the need to 
increase the international competitiveness of their products. 
  This need is felt not only by FKTU-affiliated unions but 
also 
dissident unions which last year launched general strikes, such 
as the Hyundai group workers union, the Daewoo group unions' 
conference and the National Council of Trade Unions (NCTU). 
These unions have refrained from starting labor disputes or 
from going to extremes when a dispute is indeed launched. 
  In most workplaces which have suffered strikes and work 
stoppages since 1987, when the winds of democracy began to blow 
in the country, labor and management have come to believe that 
extreme labor movements are consumptive and losing propositions. 
Toward the end of last year, businesses in such industrial 
areas as Ulsan, Changwon and Koje Island began to improve 
labor-management relations on the basis of cooperation. 
  Striking a discordant note, the dissident National Congress 
of Union Representatives (NCUR) charges that the wage guidelines 
calling for a 5 to 8.7 percent increase agreed between the FKTU 
and the Korea employers' federation was a product of secret 
bargaining. Nevertheless, these guidelines are accepted as 
reasonable by unions in most industries except those in such 
growth sectors as electronics, automobiles, steel and 
shipbuilding. Collective bargaining on wage hikes at many firms 
is proceeding according to these guidelines. 
  The NCUR, consisting of the Hyundai group workers union, the 
Daewoo group unions' conference, the NCTU and the conference of 
industrial unions, wants to form a second labor front 
independent of the FKTU this year, and therefore will not resort 
to prolonged strikes and other extreme action which might impede 
this goal. 
  At a separate May Day ceremony, the NCUR adopted a 
resolution 
warning that if the government and employers fail to show 
sincerity in collective wage bargaining -- instead citing the 
need to increase international competitiveness and the wage 
guidelines agreed between the FKTU and the Korea employers' 
federation -- it will launch a nationwide labor struggle in late 
May and early June. This warning is considered a demonstration 
of force for forming a second labor front. 
  The hard-line unions of Hyundai heavy industries, Daewoo 
shipbuilding heavy machinery and Kia Motors may launch a 
short-term strike because of their leading roles in the NCUR, 
but few expect a prolonged general strike like the one staged by 
Hyundai group unions in Ulsan last year. 
  The wage increases offered by unions at large firms for this 
year are 2 to 3 percentage points lower than last year: 12.6 
percent at Hyundai heavy industries, 13.82 percent at Daewoo 
shipbuilding and heavy machinery, 15.07 percent at Kia motors, 
and 16.3 percent at Daewoo motor. With such offers, these 
firms' unions have just started collective bargaining, with an 
eye to completing the process by early June. 
  The bottom line? It is premature to adopt an optimistic view 
toward labor-management relations in the coming year because of 
labor's demand to participate in company management, price 
hikes, the government's plan to check unions, and other 
political and economic problems affecting labor.

  [Text] Pusan, April 28 (YONHAP) -- The labor union of the 
Hanjin Heavy Industry Co. on Thursday seceded from the 
Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU) in protest against the 
recommended wage increase of 5 percent for this year earlier 
agreed on between the FKTU and the Korea Employers Federation. 
It is the third major trade union to leave the FKTU. The two 
others are the Association of Hyundai Group Unions and the 
Council of Daewoo Group Unions. 
  The Hanjin union decided on the secession in a vote 
participated by 46 union delegates. Of them, 41 voted for the 
withdrawal and two against. Three others abstained. 
  "The wage increase recommended by the FKTU and Employers 
Federation is something that undermines the development of trade 
unions. The cessation reflects the anger of all our unionists 
at the recommended wage hike," a union official said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's corporate 
investment in foreign countries in the first quarter amounted to 
466 million U.S. dollars, up 250 percent from a year earlier, 
according to the Finance Ministry. The sharp increase was 
attributed to greatly relaxed rules governing foreign 
investment. The manufacturing sector accounted for 70 percent 
of the amount, and trade, transportation, construction and 
fisheries the rest. 
  North America was the top investment market for South Korean 
industries, representing 46 percent, or 214 million dollars, 
thanks to brisk investment in computer parts factories in the 
area. Asia placed second with 32 percent and Europe third with 
19 percent. Investment by small- and medium-sized businesses 
also increased 55 percent from the same quarter of last year, 
indicating that small-amount overseas investment was steadily 
increasing.

  [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- The country's travel 
deficit is widening in "Visit Korea Year '94," Transportation 
Ministry officials said Tuesday. In the first quarter foreign 
tourists spent 799 million U.S. dollars here, a 12.4-percent 
rise, while Korean travelers shelled out 1.11 billion dollars 
abroad, up 22.9 percent. The result was a travel deficit of 315 
million dollars for the three months, up 60.7 percent from 196 
million dollars in the same period last year. The growing 
deficit was caused by a sharp increase in the number of Koreans 
traveling overseas. 
  In January-March, 735,000 Koreans went abroad, up 33.8 
percent, while 825,000 foreigners entered this country, up 20.1 
percent. The Transportation Ministry had hoped to even out 
travel revenue and spending at 4.2 billion dollars apiece this 
year, but tourism expenditure is likely to exceed revenue, the 
officials predicted.

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The Korea High-Speed 
Rail Construction Authority (KHRC) announced Monday the list of 
consortiums, comprised of eight local and eight foreign 
companies, seeking the cellular system contract for the 
Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway slated to open in 2002. The 
Seoul-Pusan high-speed line will be the world's first to adopt a 
time-division multiple access (TDMA) cellular system, widely 
used by U.S. telecom companies in their cellular phone networks, 
a KHRC spokesman said. 
  Existing bullet trains -- the TGV (Train a Grande Vitesse) 
of 
France, the ICE (Inter-City Express) of Germany and Sinkansen of 
Japan -- all use the less sensitive analog technology. 
  The applicants are ASCOM of Switzerland (with participation 
by Korea's Goldstar Information and Communications), Motorola of 
the United States (together with Hantong Engineering), Siemens 
of Germany (Siemens Korea), Ericsson GE of the United States 
(Samsung Electronics and Kukje Electronics), AMCE and Union 
Pacific of the United States (Ujin Electronics), AEG of Germany 
(Hyundai Electronics) and Rohill of the Netherlands (Tongyang 
Telecommuncations). 
  The KHRC will choose five successful companies by April 29 
and send them RFP (Request For Proposal) so that it can name the 
final awardees by year-end after screening their proposals from 
June.

  [Text] Seoul, April 27 (YONHAP) -- Korean companies were 
participating in seven oil development projects in five 
countries -- Indonesia, Yemen, Egypt, Argentina and Venezuela -- 
as of the end of March, the vice chairman of the Overseas 
Petroleum Development Association said Wednesday at a seminar in 
the Korea exhibition center, southern Seoul. 
  Yun Sok-ku said 18 Korean companies, including Korea 
Petroleum Development Corp., are exploring for oil in 18 
projects in 14 countries. 
  Korean firms have spent 1.2 billion U.S. dollars on oil 
development projects abroad and registered an income of 910 
million dollars from them, scoring a 75-percent recovery rate. 
But since the regions being explored for oil are becoming more 
remote and deeper in the sea, the success rate has declined and 
the investment cost risen, he said. 
  Yun called on the government to help boost overseas oil 
development by increasing financial assistance, educating 
personnel and building up a comprehensive information network.

Businesses on Wednesday selected 19 manpower suppliers in China 
and seven Southeast Asian countries which would be responsible 
for sending industrial trainees to South Korea. The federation 
set monthly remuneration for foreign trainee-workers at about 
210,000 won (260 dollars) per person. 
  By country, the 19 manpower suppliers include seven in 
China, 
three in the Philippines, three in Vietnam, two in Bangladesh, 
and one each in Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Myanmar [Burma]. 
A federation official said the selected suppliers will each be 
able to send up to 800 to 1,000 trainees to Korea and will have 
to pay 100 dollars per trainee to the federation as supply 
contract guarantee. 
  Foreign trainees in Korea will be assigned to practical work 
sites after they went through 220 to 350 hours of basic training 
and 660 to 1,050 hours of practical training, the official said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- The opposition 
Democratic Party [DP] on Saturday made public a list of 51 
persons it chose as witnesses and references to be used in the 
planned parliamentary probe into the Sangmudae scandal. The 
ruling and opposition parties have agreed to have an assembly 
inspection of the suspected diversion of part of Sangmudae 
construction funds into political funds in late 1992. 
  Acting DP Head Kim Won-ki said his party had decided to 
include in the list all those suspected of having played parts 
in the scandal. 
  Among the 29 listed references were President Kim Yong-sam, 
former President No Tae-u and ex-rep. So Sok-chae. The 
witnesses selected numbered 22, who included the Rev. So Eui- 
hyon, disgraced ex-head of the Buddhist Chogye order 
secretariat; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Justice Minister Kim 
Tu-hi; ex- Defense Minister Yi Chong-ku; DLP [Democratic 
Liberal Party] Rep. Kim Yun-hwan; and former Chongwadae 
[presidential office] Protective Service Head Yi Hyon-u. 
  It is not likely that all of them will actually be used as 
witnesses or references in the upcoming probe as the ruling 
party is determined to use only those whose role in the alleged 
fund diversion can be substantiated by actual evidences.

  [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- A Seoul court Monday 
granted a suspended sentence to the vice chairman of a shipping 
company affiliated with the Hyundai Group, the nation's largest 
conglomerate, accused of tax evasion and forming a "secret fund." 
  Upholding a lower court's ruling, the Seoul appellate court 
sentenced Chong Mong-hon, 47, vice chairman of Hyundai Merchant 
Marine Co., to three years in prison but suspended the jail term 
for five years, saying, "the accused contributed greatly to the 
national economic growth while serving the nation's leading 
conglomerate. Furthermore, he did not appropriate the secret 
fund for private use," although he was found guilty of having 
formed the secret fund illegally. 
  On the count of violating the foreign exchange control law, 
the court acquitted Chong, saying his company did not borrow 
money from an American firm but just "stood security" for a 
Hyundai subsidiary in America to borrow money from a U.S. bank. 
  Three other former employees of Hyundai Merchant Marine 
including former President Pak Se-yong, 54, charged in 
connection with the tax evasion and foreign exchange control 
violations, were all given suspended jail terms ranging from 
three to four years. 
  Chong and the others were arrested by the prosecution and 
accused of evading taxes totaling 5.5 billion won (about 7 
million dollars) and forming a 21.1-billion-won secret fund from 
1987 to 1991 by manipulating the company's documents, including 
yearly project reports and the minutes of senior staff meetings.

KTC who had just retired from first-line politics. And even 
today it is difficult to explain its existence minus that factor. 
  Needless to say, KTC has retired from politics. He himself 
reaffirmed this publicly on many occasions. But the fact is that 
even though he retired from active politics, it does not mean 
that his influence has also been "retired." This fact was 
verified more than once. KTC remains a member of the DP and, 
more importantly, all his men are in good shape in the DP. 
  Will the KTC-YKT alliance remain solid? Does KTC still trust 
YKT? Also, will the next DP national convention--which may 
possibly be held as early as late next year [1994]--bring no 
change in the present factional configuration? Each and every DP 
member must be pondering these questions aloud, for they are 
their greatest concerns and are a pending, long-term issue of 
the DP. In this connection, a few things have lately been 
observed anew, making it necessary to shed light again on this 
dormant issue and reexamine it. 
  They are: first, moves relating to the next party convention 
that have become visible; second, a subtle structural change in 
the power dynamics within the DP; third, a rearrangement of the 
battle line by the Tonggyodong [KTC] faction; and finally, 
Chairman Yi's moves. 
  According to the party Constitution, the next DP national 
convention is to be held in May 1995; however, in the event of a 
national election, it can be moved up by a maximum of six months 
or delayed by up to three months. Therefore, the next DP 
convention is, basically, far more than a year away, but 
Chairman Yi recently referred to the possibility of moving it up 
within the range indicated in the party Constitution. He thus 
hinted at his so-called intent for an early convention, creating 
a subtle stir in the party; until then, he had been negative 
about moving up the convention date. Now, since he himself 
raised the issue, there must have been a reason for it. 
Conversely speaking, his action proves that an anti-Yi offensive 
within the party is reaching a critical level. In fact, the 
nonmainstreamers have been demanding, intermittently though, the 
holding of an extraordinary party convention sometime in the 
first half of 1994. 
  Chairman Yi seems to be feeling the same pressure in the 
course of his management of the DP's National Assembly policy 
during the regular Assembly session, too. While the "nine man, 
nine different minds" criticism against the party leadership 
continues unabated, he could so far lead the party rather 
smoothly by effectively managing the balance of power among the 
members of the party Supreme Committee. However, as soon as he 
moved to show his own color in his National Assembly speech and 
in his parliamentary strategy as the opposition leader, the 
nonmainstreamers strongly reacted against it. Even among the 
Supreme Committee members, fewer came forward backing him up. No 
Mu-hyon and Yi Pu-yong of the Democratic faction [from the 
former DP before its merger with the UPP] turned their backs on 
him. No Mu-hyon, while holding on to his basic line since the 
last party convention in March, is nevertheless continuously 
intensifying his criticism of Chairman Yi. What makes the 
chairman worry even more is that Yi Pu-yong, who had been 
relatively cooperative, reversed his attitude, turning critical 
of the chairman. Since No and Yi Pu-yong are also members of the 
Reform group, these things have spawned speculations that 
Chairman Yi has not only lost his grip of the Democratic faction 
but is perhaps shunned by the Reform group, too. Only two 
Supreme Committee members, Kwon No-kap and Han Kwang-ok, remain 
loyal to the chairman, while the Tonggyodong faction reportedly 
sees something missing in Chairman Yi, at times feeling 
dissatisfied. 
  Meanwhile, the Tonggyodong faction has been constantly on 
the 
move since it unified its genealogy in the name of [KTC's] Naeoe 
Munje Yonguso [Institute of Internal and External Affairs]. 
Recently, it reorganized Yonchong, a private organization of 
KTC. Chairman Yi also has launched a membership drive for his 
private organization, T'ongil Sanha Hoe [Society for Reunited 
Mountains and Rivers], but he finds himself under mounting 
intraparty pressure. In short, the Reform group does not approve 
of "dual citizenship" of members, putting pressure on the 
chairman and his force. 
  Chairman Yi's camp is aware of all this subtle shifting. So 
much so that some insiders say that they might be oversensitive. 
At any rate, YKT and his force are known to be working on a 
strategy to ensure that their leadership continues after the 
National Assembly regular session and to further defend its 
power base at the next party convention while keeping a close 
eye on its own faction that is turning rebellious. They are 
also conferring on how to deal with the increasingly visible 
resistance of the progressive forces within the party and the 
growing signs of disharmony with the Tonggyodong faction, the 
main force in the DP. 
  In this atmosphere, Chairman Yi is said to have launched an 
attempt at a rapprochement with KTC recently. Actually, it does 
not pay for either side if they develop ties. For KTC, it could 
harm the image of his retirement from politics. Chairman Yi 
could also be hurt because such contact would further enhance 
his image as a weak leader unable to run the party 
independently. But the immediate reality is that something has 
to be done to change the flow in the combined forces of the DP 
apparently plagued by internal disharmony. Chairman Yi's side in 
particular seems to be feeling the need more keenly. Therefore, 
reports say, he embarked on a rapport with the Tonggyodong camp 
while discreetly maintaining a distance. 
  Acting as mediators between the two camps are Kwon No-kap 
and 
Han Kwang-ok, both members of the Supreme Committee, plus Rep. 
Mun Hui-sang, Chairman Yi's chief secretary, and Pak Chi-won, DP 
spokesman. Mun Hui-sang was the first chairman of Yonchong. He 
also served as its sixth chairman until Kim Ok-tu took over 
recently. He is one of the key figures among KTC's direct 
disciples and he is always present at their gatherings. Despite 
his position as Yi's chief secretary, he would say 
unhesitatingly that "my `home base' is Tonggyodong." Pak Chi-won 
also has his roots in Tonggyodong and was part of the KTC 
campaign in the last presidential election. The two are the key 
workers playing the role of a bridge between the YKT and KTC 
forces to prevent a split and ensure cooperation. 
  They are said to be playing the part of letting Chairman 
Yi's 
side know --through a variety of routes--what KTC thinks about 
Yi's National Assembly strategy and political course in general, 
or vice versa. They contend that there is no gap between 
Chairman Yi and KTC. They explain that there has been no change 
in their basic relationship--even amid the subtle undercurrent 
of a power game within the party. They assert that KTC has had 
no objections to Chairman Yi's political line, to the substance 
of his National Assembly speech delivered in October as a 
product of that new line, and to his news conference remarks in 
late September in which Yi stated that he would give the economy 
priority over the issue of liquidating the past--namely, to all 
those things that fed the feud within the party. Needless to 
say, it was Mun Hui-sang himself who led the work in the writing 
of that speech. Moreover, Pae Ki-son, former assistant chief 
secretary for KTC, also took an active part in it. Pae has also 
been working as an aide for Chairman Yi for some time now. 
Another source familiar with developments on both sides asserts 
that "there is nothing going on that could fundamentally reverse 
the internal balance of power within the mainstream." He insists 
that the only problem is the dissatisfaction among mainstreamers 
with the performance of Chairman Yi, who they think lacks 
leadership for an effective struggle against the ruling camp. 
And it is a problem that can be resolved, he adds. 
  The nonmainstreamers have a different view, though. While 
agreeing that the KTC-YKT alliance will not be easily shaken, 
they do not think that YKT will remain the alternate of the 
mainstreamers for too long. At the same time, the mainstreamers 
themselves have the realistic need to try and shake the 
mainstreamers from inside to make sure that he will not. Their 
concerns are, in fact, no longer over the KTC-YKT alliance but 
are focused instead on the moves of the Tonggyodong faction.

<F P=106> [By reporter Mun Hyong-nam: "Corporate Aid to Universities </F>
on the Increase; Grants of 30 Major Groups Reached 100 Billion 
Won in 1993"] 
  [Text] As they say, "universities and businesses are 
interdependent." 
  Universities' role for business communities is to provide 
them with fresh blood--human resources and theoretical bases for 
Research and Development [R&amp;D]. Korean business communities, 
preoccupied with the immediate, day-to-day developments, indeed 
had been somewhat negligent of their obligations to help 
universities, but lately they have become increasingly conscious 
of the importance of the role of universities and have stepped 
up various types of assistance to further industry-university 
cooperation, including financial aid to research programs and 
expansion of facilities as well as scholarships. 
  It was found that the total amount of aid to universities by 
the nation's 30 major business groups, including scholarships, 
research and facility funds, and other endowments, last year 
reached 100 billion won [W]. A survey conducted by CHUGAN 
MAEGYONG indicates that l7 of them disbursed a total of W91.87 
billion in aid to universities in 1993. Considering all other 
firms, however minor, and cases of inadvertent omission, the 
total amount is estimated at W100 billion. 
  The Daewoo Group topped the list with W30.4 billion, 
followed 
by Hyundai, W22.3 billion; Hanjin, W19.6 billion; Kumho, W5.78 
billion; Lucky-Goldstar, W3.03 billion; Samsung, W2.1 billion; 
Sunkyong, W2.09 billion; Kia, 1.63 billion; and Lotte W1.25 
billion. 
  Of the total aid, W30.98 billion went to facilities and 
W25.62 billion to research, while W22.08 billion went to 
endowments and contributions and W13.19 billion to scholarships. 
In the past, corporate aid mainly took the form of scholarships; 
nowadays, however, long-term support--that is, building of 
facilities, research funds for professors, endowments, and 
scholarships in that order--forms the mainstream. The survey 
found scholarships the lowest of all in weight. Also, 
industry-university cooperation such as joint research programs 
is moving ahead vigorously and in full swing. 
<H5>  Daewoo at Top With W30.4 Billion </H5>
  The survey clearly indicates that such corporate aid is 
concentrated on a limited number of universities including those 
linked with business groups, Seoul National University [SNU] and 
a few others. 
  Of Daewoo's W25.9 billion from its group fund, W16 billion 
went to Aju University, while in Hanjin's case, of the W19.56 
billion in aid to facilities funds, W16.43 billion went to Inha 
University Hospital and the Inha school system. Except for 
universities linked to particular business firms, SNU received 
the largest support, including W2 billion from Lucky-Goldstar, 
W1 billion from Hyundai and Kia respectively, W120 million from 
Kumho, and W90 million from Sunkyong--all as funds for school 
development or additional building projects. 
  Of all the business groups, Daewoo runs the largest 
university aid program. At the group level, it has, since 1991, 
disbursed more than W20 billion in annual aid, increasing the 
amount every year. The grants last year totalled W25.9 billion, 
and a 12-percent or W29 billion increase is planned for this 
year. Separate from Daewoo Group, Daewoo Foundation distributes 
W4-W5 billion every year in scholarship and research funds. So, 
the total Daewoo grants are expected to increase from W30.4 
billion in 1993 to W33 billion in 1994. 
<H5>  Aid Focused on Certain Universities Including SNU </H5>
  Affiliated firms of the Hanjin Group disbursed W19.6 billion 
last year--W40 million in scholarships and W19.56 billion in 
contributions to facilities funds. Hanjin scholarship grants are 
concentrated on group-related universities such as the Aviation 
College, Inha University, and Inha Engineering College. Of the 
W19.56 billion grants to facilities funds, W14.9 billion went to 
Inha University Hospital and W1.53 billion to the Inha school 
system. The group is planning a 68-percent increase in its aid 
this year, bringing the total to W32.87 billion. Of the planned 
grants, W26 billion will be to the Inha University Hospital 
building fund. 
  The Kumho Group last year contributed W140 million to 
scholarship programs, W120 million to the SNU development fund, 
and W20 million to the Hanguk General Arts School development 
fund. Also noteworthy is W5.5 billion it appropriated in aid to 
the 1993 operations of the Kwangju Institute of Science and 
Technology. Group Chairman Pak Song-yong has been promoting 
Kumho's positive aid to the institute as chairman of the 
preparatory committee for its founding in the past and as its 
board member now. 
  The Lucky-Goldstar Group scholarship program is for 150 
selected students every year, paying their registration fees in 
full and giving each W300,000 to pay for training aids. The 
expenses come to approximately W300 million per annum. Also, 
under an overseas training program, the group selects 25 
professors every year providing them with $20,000 each. The 
annual cost of this program is approximately W400 million. In 
particular, the group has been vigorously promoting 
industry-university cooperation. For example, it granted 
research funds to Kyongsang and Inha universities which 
participated in the development of a refrigerator for Korean 
pickle jars. Also, it added the Industry-University Cooperation 
division to the Group's R&amp;D awards to honor professors of the 
two universities. 
  The Samsung Group spent W4.2 billion in 1990 to build the 
Hoam Hall for use by the SNU faculty as living quarters and for 
research purposes. In 1992, it built for SNU a W3.5 billion 
joint research center for new computer technology. But it made 
no major contributions last year, except for a W1 billion grant 
to Kyongbuk and Chonnam universities each as the local 
university development fund. 
  The Sunkyong Group gave the "SNU Yukong Laboratory" of the 
SNU chemical engineering school W86 million every year for 10 
years through 1993 to promote joint research between industry 
and the university. The group also decided to grant the Hanyang 
University engineering school a total of W6 billion to help 
expand its facilities, delivering the second installment of W2 
billion last year. 
  In the Kia Group, Kia Motors Corp. pays the full 
registration 
fees for 40 to 50 students every year and, in addition, provides 
them with tuition subsidies under industry-university 
scholarship programs. As industry-university cooperation funds, 
it gave Hanyang and Sogang universities W300 million each last 
year. It also contributed W1 billion to the extension work of 
the SNU engineering school, and W30 million to the support fund 
for Tongguk University. Kia plans to gradually increase its aid 
in both the number of recipients and the amount of money they 
receive. 
  The Lotte Group, which had decided to grant the Pusan 
University engineering school W3 billion for its development, 
delivered W1 billion of it to the university last year. Also, 
the Samnam Scholarship Association of the Group last year 
distributed W100 million for scholarships for university 
students and W150 million to support professors' research 
activities.

Minister Tsutomu Hata will make sincere efforts to settle the 
long-standing trade row between Japan and the United States, the 
officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Spurred by growing Japanese 
investment in China, Japanese commercial banks have switched 
their attention to the Chinese market from the United States and 
Western Europe, industry sources reported Wednesday [4 May]. 
  The sources said a host of senior bank officials will make a 
fact-finding tour of China later this month. They said 20 
branch managers of Sumitomo Bank will set out on a four-day 
mission in two groups May 25, one on a tour of Beijing and 
Shanghai, and the other on a visit to Hong Kong and Shanghai. 
Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank also plans to send a group of about 10 
branch managers on a weeklong tour of Beijing, Dalian, Shanghai 
and Hong Kong, starting June 4, they said. 
  The sources said Fuji Bank, which started a regular 
inspection tour of China last year, now plans to increase the 
number of visits, sending three groups in the first fiscal half, 
which ends in September. Mitsubishi Bank also is prepared to 
step up inspection tours of China while Tokai Bank and Daiwa 
Bank have moved to form a team of experts on China, they said. 
  Japan's investment in China in 1993 soared to about 3,500 
cases from about 1,800 cases in the preceding year as an 
increasing number of Japanese manufacturers established 
production bases in the country, according to industry figures. 
Commercial banks intend to improve their services to Japanese 
firms doing business in the Chinese market, the sources said.

  [Text] New York, May 2 KYODO -- Hisashi Owada, Japanese 
ambassador to the United Nations, declared Monday [2 May] that 
Japan will make clear its resolve to get permanent membership on 
the U.N. Security Council [UNSC]. "It is very important to make 
clear Japan's determination," Owada told Japanese reporters four 
days after presenting his credentials to U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  He said Japan would try to achieve the objective without 
antagonizing other countries. "The sentiment in the U.N. and 
the world community is that Japan should play a more active 
role," he said. 
  Owada also said it is "very important" for the U.N. to 
engage 
in peacekeeping and other related activities, adding there is 
still room for Japan to do more within its peacekeeping 
cooperation law. 
  Owada, father of Crown Princess Masako, took up his U.N. 
post 
on April 28, replacing another career diplomat Yoshio Hatano.

  [Text] Nice, France, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii on Wednesday [4 May] proposed that the 
1997 annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] be held 
in Fukuoka, western Japan. The 1997 meeting will be the 30th 
anniversary of the bank's founding. 
  Fujii made the invitation in a speech before the ADB's 27th 
Annual General Meeting that opened in Nice on Tuesday for a 
three-day run as the Manila-based financial institution faces 
the task of raising its capital base. 
  If the proposal is accepted, it would be the first in 10 
years and the third time for Japan to host an ADB annual meeting 
following the 20th meeting held in Osaka in 1987. Fujii said 
the Japanese city has played an historical role in promoting 
ties with the Asia-Pacific region and its importance will be 
greater in the region. 
  Turning to the issue of raising the bank's capital, Fujii 
appealed for endorsing a bank proposal to double the capital to 
smooth disbursement of bank loans to meet growing funding needs 
in the Asia-Pacific region, whose economy is expected to grow 
faster than any other region. 
  A vote on the capital increase is scheduled for May 22. 
  Fujii also pointed to the need for the bank to shift away 
from development-oriented financial help to fighting poverty and 
developing social infrastructures such as health and medical 
facilities and protecting the environment. 
  He also pointed to difficult fiscal conditions in member 
countries and called for the bank to provide funds in an 
efficient manner. 
  Before giving the speech, Fujii met with U.S. Deputy 
Treasury 
Secretary Roger Altman to discuss pending bilateral economic 
issues, according to Japanese officials. 
  Fujii told Altman that Japan has not changed its policy of 
promoting economic reforms and deregulation despite a recent 
cabinet reshuffle and is ready to pass the overdue fiscal 1994 
national budget as early as possible while carrying out tax 
reforms, they said. The issue of how to stabilize exchange 
rates was also on the agenda, they said.

  [Text] Fukuoka, May 4 KYODO -- The city of Fukuoka on 
Wednesday [4 May] welcomed a proposal to host the annual meeting 
of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] in 1997. "I'm convinced 
that our city is eligible because the Asian Development Bank's 
policy of contributing to development in the Asia-Pacific region 
matches Fukuoka city's policy," Fukuoka Mayor Keiichi Kuwahara 
said. 
  Kuwahara made the statement after Japanese Finance Minister 
Hirohisa Fujii proposed the holding of the 30th annual meeting 
of the ADB in 1997 in Fukuoka at an ADB annual meeting in Nice, 
France Wednesday. Fukuoka is located in the northern part of 
Kyushu, the most southwestern main island of Japan. 
  "It's a great pleasure. It will help make not only Fukuoka 
but also Kyushu better known" said Tatsuo Kawai, chairman of the 
Kyushu-Yamaguchi Economic Federation, a local business group. 
  The Fukuoka business community hopes that by holding the ADB 
meeting in their city, it will enhance its image as a city open 
to Asia.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- The wage gap between the 
industrialized and developing worlds remains wide in nominal 
terms but is on a steady decline in real terms, the Labor 
Ministry said Wednesday [4 May] in an annual report. The report 
comes amid a surge in industrialized nations' claims that their 
economic hardships can be partly attributed to an export 
offensive by developing countries in Asia taking advantage of 
cheap labor costs. 
  Wage levels in newly industrialized economies (NIES) such as 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea have shot up since 
the early 1970s and the sharp wage increase has helped erode 
their labor cost advantage, the report said. 
  In the early 1970s, wages in these Asian countries were at a 
level of about 10 percent of those in industrialized nations, in 
the mid-1980s at about 30 percent and around 1990 at nearly 40 
percent, according to the report. 
  As for 1991, wages in these Asian NIES in the manufacturing 
sector were at 37 to 40 against the base of 100 for the United 
States, the report said. 
  The report also compared real wages between industrialized 
nations and NIES through a means called purchasing parity and 
calculated the purchasing power of a country's currency in 
dollar terms. 
  Under this method, the wage gap between Asian NIES and the 
U.S. was found to be smaller, with wages in Hong Kong and South 
Korea calculated at 65 percent of those in the U.S. wages in 
Thailand and the Philippines were tabulated at 20 percent of 
those in the U.S.

(DSP), said Monday [2 May] he is against the idea of holding 
general elections under the existing system of multi-seat 
constituencies. He said the government of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata has been born amid the electoral system reform 
movement and that he does not see any need to hold the next 
general elections under "the old system" which will be replaced 
by a new electoral system for the House of Representatives. 
  Ouchi made the remarks at a news conference after arriving 
in 
Geneva to attend a general meeting of the World Health 
Organization. 
  The new electoral system features a combination of 300 
single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation 
seats and reduces the total number of lower house seats from the 
current 511. 
  Asked to comment on Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa, a backroom strategist of the coalition 
government, Ouchi said Ozawa is "high-handed" when it comes to 
the democratic process. "(His) initiatives for welfare tax and 
a cabinet reshuffle were not at times appropriate," Ouchi said, 
referring to the botched schemes which widened the division 
within the coalition government of former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- The leader of New Party Mirai 
(Future), a five-member group in the House of Representatives, 
said Wednesday [as received] the next general election must be 
conducted under a new electoral system that combines 300 single 
seats and 200 others chosen through proportional representation. 
  In issuing a party statement, Michihiko Kano said the Diet 
must enact a bill to delineate constituencies during the current 
150-day regular session, which may be extended past the June 29 
deadline in order to pass it. 
  New Party Mirai's statement countered calls from both the 
ruling and opposition parties for an early dissolution of the 
House of Representatives for a snap general election even under 
the existing multiseat constituencies. 
  Kano and four others quit the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
last month amid political unrest sparked by then Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's April 8 announcement to resign. They formed 
the new party on April 18.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- The right-hand man of the 
governing coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa said he will 
continue efforts to amalgamate ruling coalition parties into one 
unified party, while calling on the socialists to return to the 
fold. 
  Kozo Watanabe, former minister of international trade and 
industry and a Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] executive, 
rejected a call from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan 
-- SDPJ], however, to disband the 130-legislator parliamentary 
bloc, Kaishin (Innovation), in the House of Representatives as a 
prerequisite for its return to the alliance. 
  "I have pushed at every occasion the proposal by former 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to create a unified parliamentary 
force from within the governing coalition," Watanabe said in an 
interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  "The proposal has been accomplished at a 
faster-than-expected 
pace thanks to the prodding by (Democratic Socialist Party) 
Chairman Keigo Ouchi," he said, in an apparent reference to 
Ouchi's surprise appeal April 25 to speed up the formation of 
the parliamentary bloc. The appeal -- issued shortly after the 
nomination of Tsutomu Hata as the new premier -- prompted the 
DSP, Shinseito, Japan New Party, Liberal Party and the 
Kaikaku-no-kai [Reform Group] to form the unified Diet bloc 
Kaishin by the end of the day. 
  The establishment of the grouping enraged the SDP, which 
subsequently announced its withdrawal from the coalition, 
rendering the Hata administration to a fragile minority 
government vulnerable to a possible tabling of a nonconfidence 
motion from the opposition. 
  Watanabe dismissed the SDP's allegation that the 
Shinseito-led conservative mainstream "betrayed" the socialists 
in a bid to force the SDP to compromise its ideological and 
policy differences with the rest of the coalition. "The 
allegation that we waged a sneak assault (on the socialists) is 
unfounded," he said in the interview before his departure for 
Myanmar [Burma]. 
  Watanabe appealed to the SDP to return to the alliance, 
saying, "It is crucial for us to soften the Social Democratic 
Party's emotional antagonism toward us... and lead them to 
support the current administration." 
  The former Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] member also said 
the coalition will try to garner support from the LDP for its 
proposal to raise the consumption tax from the current 3 percent. 
  "Discussion on the tax system should be conducted for the 
sake of this nation, apart from the interests of each political 
party, so it is important to seek the endorsement of the LDP," 
he said. 
  The coalition has asserted that a consumption tax hike is 
indispensable to enable the national treasury to extend this 
year's income tax cuts beyond one term.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- The supreme leader of the 
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) urged Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
Tuesday [3 May] to dissolve the House of Representatives for a 
snap general election to see where voters stand on a minority 
government. Kenji Miyamoto, chairman of the JCP Central 
Committee, said, "The Hata cabinet must tap the will of voters 
since the government has fallen to a minority government." 
  Speaking at the party-sponsored Red Flag Festival, Miyamoto 
said the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] quit 
the coalition after its partners made light of it. 
  JCP Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa, who also spoke at the event, 
accused the United States of provoking war against North Korea. 
  Fuwa said, "The U.S. is the world's largest nuclear power. 
The U.S. is provoking war and punishing another country if it 
is trying to obtain nuclear arms." 
  He also accused the U.S. of threatening the peace in Asia 
and 
rest of the world. Fuwa said Japan must never join the U.S. if 
it imposes sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Two left-wing opposition 
parties said Monday [2 May] the new cabinet of Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is trying to spoil the war-renouncing Constitution. 
  The Social Democratic Party [of Japan, SDPJ] (SDP) and the 
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) issued separate statements on the 
eve of the 47th anniversary of the Constitution. 
  The SDP, which quit the coalition last week to turn [as 
received] the No. 2 opposition party, said it wants to protest 
against what it called the "dangerous intentions" of the 
administration. 
  "We are worried that some members of the Hata administration 
are supporting collective defense, forbidden under the 
Constitution, and supposing `emergencies' on the Korean 
peninsula, and that they have spoken with the intention of 
changing the Constitution in order to deal with the situation," 
the SDP said. 
  The JCP said, "the new administration is trying to impose an 
extraordinary system and an emergency system on the people, on 
the pretext of `sanctions' against North Korea." 
  "We take it seriously that some ministers have urged the 
government to change its current interpretation that resorting 
to collective defense is a violation of the Constitution," the 
JCP said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal 
with emergencies including possible international sanctions 
against North Korea related to Pyongyang's suspected nuclear 
weapons development.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Supporters and opponents of 
Japan's war-renouncing Constitution marked the 47th anniversary 
of the Constitution on Tuesday [3 May] with demonstrations and 
rallies. Participating in those events were civic groups and 
political parties defending the Constitution and those 
advocating its revision to open the way for collective defense 
and a greater role in U.N. Peacekeeping operations. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), which ardently opposes any constitutional amendment 
expanding the scope of Japan's Self-Defense Forces (SDF), 
addressed followers in front of the main entrance of Tokyo's 
Ueno Park. 
  "Some in the new cabinet are arguing that introducing 
collective defense should be reconsidered, but we owe it to our 
pacifist Constitution alone that Japan has not participated in a 
war during the almost 50 years since World War II," Murayama 
said. 
  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Hiroshi Kumagai have expressed support for legislation to deal 
with emergencies including possible international sanctions 
against North Korea for its suspected nuclear weapons 
development. 
  Prominent constitution experts discussed the pros and cons 
of 
a revision at a rally organized by an SDP-affiliated citizens 
group at Hibiya public hall in the afternoon. 
  Pacifist citizens' groups demonstrated at several places in 
Tokyo, while representatives of the Buddhist-backed Komeito 
[Clean Government Party] and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) 
delivered speeches in support of the current Constitution in 
front of Shinjuku Station. 
  Two groups supporting a greater military role for Japan held 
rallies and panel discussions at different venues in Chiyoda 
Ward.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Rice transactions by 
agricultural cooperatives across the nation in the rice year 
ended last June dropped to a 13-year low due to the worst 
harvest in the postwar period, the National Federation of 
Agricultural Cooperative Associations (Zenno) reported Wednesday 
[4 May]. 
  The federation said the value of its rice trading stood at 
1.69 trillion yen, down 441.5 billion yen from the preceding 
year. It was the first time in 13 years that rice trading fell 
below 2 trillion yen, it said. 
  Zenno handles 95 percent of the nation's rice harvest 
annually. The federation earlier estimated the value of its rice 
trading in the 1993 rice year at 2,284.6 billion yen, up 153.1 
billion yen over the year before. The previous low of 1.9 
trillion yen was recorded in the 1980 rice year. The federation 
forecast rice trading will recover the 2 trillion yen level in 
the current year and total 2,220.6 billion yen.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Illegal rice transactions in 
the six months to the end of March nearly tripled compared with 
a year earlier due to the worst postwar rice harvest last year, 
a survey by KYODO NEWS SERVICE showed Wednesday [4 May]. 
According to the survey, conducted through Food Agency offices 
in 47 prefectures in April, the Food Agency reported 430 cases 
of illegal rice dealings from October to March, a 2.7-fold 
increase over the year before. 
  Of the total, administrative action was taken against nearly 
50 cases. 
  In Japan, rice is kept under government control and is 
distributed only through licensed wholesalers and retailers. 
  In one case, the Food Agency sought legal action against a 
rice dealer in Toyama Prefecture for selling rice through 
unauthorized sales channels, a violation of the Food Control Law. 
  The survey showed that at least two agricultural 
cooperatives, one in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, and the other in 
Shizuoka Prefecture, were found to have sold rice outside 
government-controlled channels. 
  In some 40 cases, the agency issued administrative notices 
ordering dealers to abide by the law. 
  The survey showed that 14 of 50 retailers and supermarkets 
across the nation were found to have ignored the agency's 
instructions to sell bags of mixed domestic and imported rice. 
Thai rice was found to be unpopular among Japanese consumers, 
and wholesalers were forced to buy back unsold Thai rice from 
retailers at a discount rate, the survey showed.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 3 KYODO -- Japan's 11 major commercial 
banks have agreed to cooperate to avert credit crises caused by 
their own liquidity shortages, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN said 
Tuesday [3 May]. 
  At the behest of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), the 11 banks have 
created a scheme under which, when one of them lapses into a 
liquidity crisis through failure to secure necessary amounts of 
cash in the money market, the others are required to make 
low-interest, emergency loans to the beleagured bank. The plan 
calls for up to 300 billion yen in loans per bank, which means 
the maximum available funds for the troubled bank could run as 
much as 3 trillion yen. 
  In practice, the loans would be made in the form of the 
rescuers' purchase of certificates of deposit (CDs) issued by 
the institution in crisis. 
  The bigger of the 11 "city banks" each procure 2-3 trillion 
yen of funds daily in interbank trading on the Tokyo money 
market. 
  Currently, the BOJ is required to come to rescue of 
institutions which are unable to secure the necessary sums. But 
concerned that fund shortages could exceed its capacity, the BOJ 
has strongly called on the 11 institutions to establish their 
own support system to handle cases of credit crisis.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Six out of every 10 big 
companies say they are overstaffed in the wake of Japan's worst 
economic recession in postwar history, according to a survey 
released Wednesday [4 May] by an affiliate of the national 
personnel authority. 
  The Japan Institute of Personnel Administration asked 1,052 
major Japanese companies, including some which are listed on the 
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A total of 34.6 
percent of the firms responded to the survey, which was 
conducted last October. 
  Of the respondents, 16.8 percent said the number of their 
employees outstrips their earnings performance, the survey 
found. The figure contrasted sharply with the corresponding 
figure of 7.5 percent a year before. 
  More than 41 percent of the respondents said their labor 
supply in relation to their business performance was "rather 
excessive." The corresponding figure for the previous year was 
28.6 percent. 
  The survey also showed that the larger the corporation, the 
heavier the labor burden. The recession was seen as weighing 
particularly heavily on manufacturers as opposed to those in the 
service or retail industries. 
  About 36 percent of the respondents in nonmanufacturing 
sectors said they implemented some type of labor retrenchment 
programs in 1993, according to the survey. Of the figure, 77.9 
percent said they refrained from recruiting new employees, 
followed by 70.6 percent which squeezed overtime hours of 
employees and 58.9 percent who transferred employees to 
subsidiaries or subcontractors. 
  A total of 5.5 percent said they pared down their work force 
by recommending employees to voluntarily quit the company, the 
survey said. 
  A total of 9.8 percent replied that they implemented 
temporary lay-off programs, the survey said.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- Japanese companies have 
reached the point where they can no longer sustain employment 
simply by replacing workers within their own business groups and 
must consider sending them to other firms, including ones 
overseas, a governmental panel said in a report Monday [2 May]. 
  The report, on the issue of boosting employment, 
particularly 
for middle-aged white collar workers, was compiled by the 
advisory panel to the Labor Ministry's Employment Security 
Bureau chief. 
  It said middle-aged workers should accept being transferred 
outside of their company group in order to remain in employment, 
and that such transfers should be allowed to be permanent if 
those workers agree. 
  Also, companies should consider sending "excess" workers 
overseas to Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe where Japanese 
business know-how is welcomed, the report said. 
  According to a recent survey by the Management and 
Coordination Agency, the population of white collar workers aged 
over 45 swelled to 12.18 million in 1993, 18.8 percent of the 
entire workforce, from 6.07 million or 11.5 percent in 1973. 
  The increase is partly because there are now more older 
people than younger ones in Japan. 
  Many Japanese companies making streamlining efforts to cope 
with the current recession have "excess" workforce, particularly 
among their middle-aged, white collar workers.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- Japanese consumer 
sentiment picked up in the January-March quarter following two 
previous consecutive quarterly drops, with improving confidence 
in the labor situation, the government said Monday [25 April]. 
  The consumer sentiment index for the first quarter stood at 
a 
seasonally adjusted 38.1, up 5.6 percent from the 
October-December quarter, said the Economic Planning Agency. 
The index is a gauge of consumer expectations as to whether or 
not things will improve in six months' time in five areas 
including labor, income and prices. 
  An agency official said the recovery in consumer sentiment 
was mainly because the number of people with pessimistic 
outlooks was declining, rather than those with optimistic 
projections increasing.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 4 KYODO -- Japan's young population 
declined further to total 20.59 million children under the age 
of 15 as of April 1, down 500,000 from a year ago, the 
Management and Coordination Agency said Wednesday [4 May], a day 
before Children's Day. As of April 1 this year, children 
accounted for 16.5 percent of the nation's 125 million 
population, down 0.4 percentage points from the previous year, 
the agency said. 
  Since 1975, Japan has witnessed a steady decline in its 
population of children, a trend often referred to as Japan's 
aging society. 
  The largest portion of the nation's children, some 1.62 
million, are already teenagers aged 14. Reflecting the 
declining birth rate over the last decade, the younger the 
child, the fewer peers in his age group. 
  About 1.2 million children belong to each age group between 
1 
and 4. Children under 1 year old numbered 1.19 million. 
  Okinawa Prefecture was Japan's "youngest" prefecture with 
more than one in five persons, or 22.8 percent, under 15, 
according to statistics as of October 1, 1993. Following were 
Saga Prefecture and Miyazaki Prefecture with 18.9 percent each. 
  In contrast, Tokyo with more than 11 million inhabitants had 
the lowest share of children with some 13.9 percent. A slightly 
higher percentage of young people were living in Toyama 
prefecture, with 15.8 percent, and Kanagawa Prefecture, with 
15.9 percent. 
  In all 47 prefectures, the share of children was lower than 
the previous year. 
  Compared with other aging industrialized nations, Japan came 
third after Italy and Germany, where children under 15 accounted 
for 16.3 percent of the national populations, based on 1991 and 
1992 surveys, respectively.

  [Text] Indonesia will explore the possibility of making 
contact with Amnesty International, an international 
nongovernmental organization, to discuss various matters, 
especially the East Timor issue, to enable them to understand 
the incorporation of the territory into Indonesia. Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said this in Jakarta today before leaving 
for a tripartite meeting with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
and Portuguese Foreign Minister Durao Barroso in Geneva on 6 
May. According to Ali Alatas, Indonesia's readiness to accept 
members of international nongovernmental organizations and 
foreign reporters is part of its effort to create mutual trust 
with Portugal. 
  Regarding Vietnamese refugees on Galang Island, Riau, Ali 
Alatas confirmed that a refugee died from self-immolation when 
an interdepartmental team visited the area recently. Ali Alatas 
deeply regretted the inevitable incident.

  [Text] The Indonesian Government will not force Vietnamese 
refugees currently housed on Galang Island in Riau to return 
home. The planned repatriation of all the Vietnamese refugees is 
based on an old agreement between the two countries. Vietnamese 
President Le Duc Anh, who visited Indonesia recently, agreed to 
speed up the repatriation. 
  Replying to reporters on the refugee protests on Galang 
Island where some have died from self-immolation, Foreign 
Minister Ali Alatas said the protests had been staged by a group 
of refugees who failed to pass the screening test for 
resettlement in third countries. The protests were not directed 
at the Indonesian Government but rather at the United Nations 
High Commission for Refugees. According to Ali Alatas, about 
140 out of the estimated 8,000 refugees are prepared to return 
to Vietnam.

  [Text] The government does not recognize the existence of 
the Association of Democratic People [PRD] established on 2 May. 
This is because the organization is inclined to conduct 
political activities and is therefore against Law No. 3/1985 on 
political parties and the functional group. Speaking after 
chairing a coordinated meeting in Jakarta, Coordinating Minister 
for Politics and Security Affairs Susilo Sudarman said the three 
organizations legally allowed to conduct political activities 
are the United Development Party, the Functional Group, and the 
Indonesian Democratic Party. Therefore, the existence of PRD is 
against the above law.

  [Text] Jakarta -- January-December 1993 period saw an 
increase of 3.84 percent in Indonesia's imports with December 
registering an import increase of 1.30 percent compared with the 
corresponding period in 1992, a report from the Ministry for 
Trade discloses. 
  According to report made available to ANTARA here over the 
weekend, the import increase is lower than 20.96 percent of 
increase registered for 1988-1992. 
  Indonesia's imports in December totalled 2.821 billion U.S. 
dollars, while in December 1992 the figure stood at 2.785 
billion U.S. dollars. 
  During January-December 1993 period, the total imports rose 
to 28.3 billion U.S. dollars from 27.3 billion U.S. dollars 
recorded in the previous year. 
  The report also said that the increase of import value in 
1993 was low in comparison with that of 1992 because of the low 
growth in the import value of non-oil/gas commodities, which in 
its turn was attributed to the low growth registered in the 
import of capital goods and auxiliary raw materials. 
  All this, the report continued, illustrates that in 1993 
domestic investments, either new investments or expansion of 
existing investments, did not develop well. 
  Likewise, the report noted production activities did not go 
on at a pace as rapid as that during 1988-1992. 
  However, it is interesting to note, the report continued, 
that compared with the value recorded for 1992, imports of 
consumer goods decreased in value in 1993, adding that this 
decrease was related to the decline in the imports of beverages 
and processed foods for households and durable consumer goods. 
  The report revealed that the imports of consumer goods in 
1993 went down by 5.95 percent, viz. from 1.176 billion U.S. 
dollars registered in 1992 to 1.106 billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] A ceremony was held at Lan Xang Hotel on the 
evening of 29 April to sign a contract to buy a 50-kw short wave 
radio broadcasting system between the Ministry of Information 
and Culture and the Telstra Company of Australia. Representing 
the Lao side at the signing ceremony was Bounteng Vongsai, 
deputy minister of information and culture; while the Australian 
side was represented by Barley, Telstra Lao branch director. 
Witnessing the contract signing were Bouasi Chaleunsouk, deputy 
minister of information and culture; Michael Mann, ambassador 
extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Australia to Laos; 
representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and 
Finance; and senior officials from various services concerned. 
  The aim of purchasing the 50-kw short wave radio 
broadcasting 
system at a cost of more than $1 million is to allow all 
localities and provinces throughout the country to receive 
broadcasting programs of the national radio station. This is 
because at present, many regions in the country are still unable 
to tune in the station's programs. Installation of the system 
will enable our country to possess a new modern short wave radio 
broadcasting station to beam radio programs to all regions 
throughout the country. Installation of this new radio 
transmitter will be completed within one year beginning on the 
day the contract was signed.

under the Kwangju and South Cholla Provincial Federation of 
General Student Councils (Namchongnyon) held a rally and a 
demonstration in Kwangju on April 29 in memory of a student of 
Chonnam National University, Pak Sung-hui, who set herself 
ablaze in protest against the brutal murder of patriotic 
students by the fascist clique of the "Sixth Republic" on April 
29, 1991, according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  They continued the demonstration till 11:00 at night, 
pelting 
stones at police. 
  On the same day, over 200 people of the joint measure 
committee for the case of murder of Yun Kum-i and the 
headquarters of the movement for uprooting the U.S. Army's 
crimes staged a sit-in at the puppet supreme court protesting a 
formal trial by the puppets on the murderer of the U.S. Army who 
killed Yun Kum-i, a South Korean woman, in cold blood in October 
1992. 
  An estimated 2,000 students in Seoul on April 30 held an 
avowal rally on the occasion of May Day before going over to a 
demonstration. 
  They denounced the Kim Yong-sam group for branding the 
workers' demand for a wage hike as "collective egoism", and held 
a street demonstration demanding the abolition of the evil 
labour law and the dissolution of the "government"-subsidized 
South Korean General Federation of Trade Unions (Nochong).

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
(CPRF) in a statement on May 3 bitterly denounces in the name of 
the nation the treacherous crime of the Kim Yong-sam group in 
totally blocking dialogue and negotiation for the relaxation of 
tensions and peaceful reunification and running about recklessly 
to unleash a nuclear war for destroying the entire nation, in 
league with outside forces. 
  Recalling that the present South Korean rulers are opposing 
the convocation of a national conference with far- fetched 
arguments and are these days rushing headlong along a dangerous 
road of war against the North with the encouragement of outside 
forces, the spokesman says: 
  "It is the unshakable will of the entire nation to break the 
deadlock and open up a decisive phase for reunification by 
achieving great national unity this year, one year before the 
50th anniversary of the liberation of the country. [no closing 
quotation mark as received] 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must act with discretion, clearly 
mindful that their blocking the historical national conference 
proposed to be convened around August 15 is an unpardonable 
anti-national crime against reunification. 
  The spokesman ardently calls upon all the political parties, 
organisations and individual figures in South Korea and overseas 
Koreans to join in the grand march for reunification with a bold 
decision. 
  He expresses the hope that all the progressive organisations 
and people of the world will pay deep attention to the grave 
situation created on the Korean peninsula and continue to extend 
active support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just 
cause of national reconciliation and unity and the peaceful 
reunification of the country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Violent War Remarks by the Civilian </F>
Warmongers"] 
  [Text] As you, South Korean youths and students, are well 
aware of the fact that whenever it opens its mouth, the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique under a civilian guise is unhesitatingly 
spinning out bellicose gibberish against our Republic. 
  Not long ago, a man named Yi Pyong-tae, who is said to be 
the 
puppet minister of national defense of South Korea, talked about 
the integration [tonghap] through a northward invasion, babbling 
about launching a so-called retaliation through strong 
punishment and about making use of this as an opportunity for 
reunification when needs arise. He even revealed a plan for a 
northward war of aggression called New Operational Plan 
5027--which is to be composed of 5-phase operational concepts. 
  Timed with this, traitor Kim Chong-pil, the so-called 
chairman of the Democratic Liberal Party, has said that it is 
necessary to cope with [taeung] the North in a cool-headed and 
firm manner, saying that dialogues with compatriots as advocated 
by many people is a fantasy. 
  As the saying goes: A crow can make no other voice than a 
caw 
no matter how much it strains its voice, only bellicose violent 
war remarks are being shouted out from the mouth of the 
warmaniac Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique. 
  Last year, a man named Kwon Yong-hae, then puppet national 
defense minister, said that he would not hesitate to take the 
so- called military countermeasure [taeung], finding fault with 
our so-called nuclear development. Babbling about the threat of 
a southward invasion by the North, traitor Kim Yong-sam, a 
civilian warmonger, loudly stressed the need to work out every 
kind of countermeasures. 
  The remarks against the northern part of the Republic made 
by 
the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique are bellicose absurd remarks 
deeply reeking of a northward invasion. 
  Although they had carried out numerous provocative maneuvers 
against the northern part of the Republic, the preceding South 
Korean ruling cliques dared not to make blustering gibberish of 
a northward invasion as the Kim Yong-sam ring is doing. 
  Either at the scenes of riotous eating at Chongwadae 
[presidential office] or during its tour of the frontline area, 
the Kim Yong-sam ring is continuously making violent war remarks 
aimed at crushing [apsal] the Republic under the poor excuses. 
  The reality clearly shows that no matter how loud it babbles 
about being civilian, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous clique is a 
group of cutthroat warmaniacs far exceeding their predecessor 
military dictators. 
  Then, for what is the Kim Yong-sam unhesitatingly making 
gunpowder-reeking violent war remarks? The reason lies in 
their earnest [otokehana] attempt to (?ignite) the fuse of war 
of a northward invasion, inciting the (?atmosphere) of 
confrontation and mistrust and artificially straining the 
situation while indiscriminately spinning out reckless remarks 
against the northern part of the Republic. In other words, this 
means that the Kim Yong- sam ring, under the civilian ironclad 
helmet, will by any means [kioko] realize its ambition to 
reunify the nation by defeating communism. 
  (?In reality), despite the strong opposition and rejection 
from the people at home and abroad, the Kim Yong-sam treacherous 
clique is trying to inflict nuclear disasters on its compatriots 
in collusion with its master by deploying new-type Patriot 
missiles in South Korea and even offering more military bases 
for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
  Because of the reckless maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam 
treacherous clique, a tense situation is being created today on 
the Korean peninsula in which no one knows when a nuclear war 
might break out. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is bringing the situation to 
the brink of a dangerous war while continuously making bellicose 
gibberish against the northern part of the Republic. This can 
never be tolerated. 
  It is extremely just for the South Korean youths and 
students, who are firmly united around the South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils to forcefully stage the 
struggle against the United States, war, nuclear, and the 
government. 
  If the forces of aggression and war servants are left intact 
in South Korea, our nation cannot avert the danger of nuclear 
disasters. 
  If the South Korean puppet clique thinks that, under its 
master's instigation, it can threaten and bring to the knees the 
Republic through the violent war remarks and introduction of 
modern weapons of mass destruction, and by playing with fire of 
a nuclear war, it is a wild fancy. 
  Even if the warmongers should play with the fire of Team 
Spirit, our people will not be surprised, nor they will be 
surprised, even if they should make a threat by introducing 
something more formidable than [kuboda tohangosul] Patriot 
missiles. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should put into action the 
reckless violent war remarks, then, it will not be able to 
escape the fate of a tiger moth enjoying a flame.

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "Arms Buildup Maneuvers Aimed at an </F>
Northward Invasion"] 
  [Text] The Kim Yong-sam puppet traitor, who is maneuvering, 
together with foreign forces, to inflict by any means [kioi] 
nuclear disasters on the heads of the nation has recently been 
running amok to introduce numerous modern weapons from the 
United States. 
  At the talks held between U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry, 
who visited Seoul not long ago, and the puppet military leaders, 
the issue of purchasing U.S. military equipment was emphasized, 
and, in particular, the South Korean puppets begged the United 
States to deploy ultramodern military equipment at an early 
date. This is a well-known fact to the world. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring, the U.S. war servant who dons a 
civilian cloak, has recently been doing the dirtiest and most 
vicious acts, in an indiscreet way, to ignite the fuse of war 
aimed at annihilating [myolsal] its compatriots, talking about 
the introduction of Patriot missiles, artillery pieces, and 
tanks and the resumption of the Team Spirit exercise. 
  As it has also been reported recently, the Kim Yong-sam 
nation- selling, treacherous clique has agreed with the United 
States to purchase more ultramodern weapons, including Apache 
assault helicopters and anti-tank missiles which it has already 
introduced from the United States. In this connection, the 
puppets will soon begin to purchase weapons. If such weapons are 
introduced into South Korea, the puppet Army's arms buildup 
plan, which is now being materialized, will reportedly be 
finalized ahead of schedule. 
  This is an extremely dangerous military act. As is known, 
the United States and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique have not 
long ago introduced Patriot missiles--weapons of mass 
destruction--and deployed them in a central area of the 
frontline. 
  What is ridiculous is the fact that the U.S. imperialists 
and 
the South Korean warlovers are babbling that the deployment of 
Patriot missiles is for shoring up anti-air defense capability 
and this serves as an effective defense means against someone's 
surprise attack. But, this is nothing but a poor excuse aimed at 
covering up their aggressive attempt. 
  According to what they have owned up themselves, the 
missiles, which have been deployed in South Korea recently, are 
the ones for which the Patriot missiles--used during the last 
Persian Gulf war-- have been improved and their capacity has 
been upgraded to a higher level. The Patriot missiles are not 
interceptor missiles used simply for defense, but ultramodern 
war means which can be used also as attack weapons aimed at 
striking the other side. 
  There is no need for a long-winded explanation as to the 
fact 
that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are 
trying to attack us with the Patriot missiles, while igniting 
the fuse of war. Not satisfied with the introduction and 
deployment of lethal equipment, including Patriot missiles and 
Apache assault helicopters, in the areas of the Military 
Demarcation Line, they are trying to introduce more ultramodern 
war means. This suggests that the maneuvers of provoking a 
northward war of aggression by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim 
Yong-sam puppet clique are reaching an extreme. 
  The Kim Yong-sam ring has unilaterally ruptured the hard-won 
contacts of working-level delegates for the preparation of 
exchange of North-South special envoys. Following this, it is 
openly inciting a war fever while spreading a rumor of someone's 
provocation of a southward invasion. In the meantime, it has 
made public even the plan for a northward war of invasion called 
"New Operational Plan 5027," which it has thus far kept as a 
secret, and it is introducing U.S.-made lethal weapons on a 
large scale into South Korea. This can never be overlooked. 
  As long as the traitor like the nation-seller Kim Yong-sam 
remains in power in South Korea, it is now clear to everyone 
that disasters of a nuclear war cannot be avoided. 
  History has shown how miserable the end of traitors running 
counter to the current of the times has been. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique 
should ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula by all means 
[kutnae], turning their faces away from the aspirations of the 
times and the demands of the nation and continuing to build up 
aggressive armed forces, the provokers will surely be burned to 
death by the fire they have ignited.

<F P=106> ["True Picture of 'Upright Politics'" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today 
comments on the fact that the traitor Kim Yong-sam raked up a 
fabulous amount of political fund around the "presidential 
elections" at the end of 1992. 
  The news analyst says: 
  At the time of the "presidential elections" Kim Hyon-chol, 
the second son of Kim Yong-sam, received 120 million won from 
traditional medicine manufacturers through lawyer Yi Chun-pom 
and wrote a memorandum promising them to resolve their "civil 
petition." 
  The opposition parties contend that Kim Hyon-chol's name was 
inscribed on the bills that Yi Chun-pom received and they were 
offered as fund for "presidential elections", not as lawyer's 
fees. 
  This shows what base means the traitor Kim Yong-sam employed 
in collecting political funds, mobilizing even his son behind 
the scene, while publicly promising that he would not receive 
political funds and would pursue "no costly politics" at the 
time of the "presidential elections." 
  An opposition party of South Korea is demanding 
"parliamentary investigation into state policies" and an 
explanation by the "president" for the clarification of the 
truth, saying that eight billion won of the 22,700 million won 
of secret fund created by the Chongu Construction Company which 
undertook the transfer of the Sangmudae Training Center found 
its way into the "Democratic Liberal Party" of Kim Yong-sam on 
the threshold of the "presidential elections." 
  The scandal of Kim Hyon-chol and the political fund scandal 
involving the Sangmudae prove once again that the traitor Kim 
Yong-sam bought the "presidential" seat with political fund. 
  It is shameless of Kim Yong-sam to advertise "upright 
politics." 
  A true upright politics can be realised only when the 
money-lover Kim Yong-sam is ousted and an independent democratic 
government is established.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the 
Korean Religionists' Council issued a statement Monday calling 
on all religionists of South Korea to rise up in a struggle for 
the convocation of a national conference. 
  The statement says the Kim Yong-sam group of South Korea 
shows a negative attitude toward the North-proposed convocation 
of a national conference and it is resorting to criminal moves 
to unleash a nuclear war despite the unanimous protest and 
denunciation from people at home and abroad. 
  This is a heinous treachery to reduce South Korea to a 
market 
for U.S. weapons and victimise the nation for big powers, the 
statement notes, and continues: 
  Achievement of the great unity of the whole nation is the 
only way for our nation to overcome the grave difficulties 
caused by the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
group and realise peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  The religionists and religious organisations in the North, 
South and overseas should show their will for great national 
unity by a practical action by taking an active part in the 
patriotic struggle for the convocation of a national conference. 
  We earnestly call on all religionists of South Korea to turn 
out as one in the struggle to check and frustrate the South 
Korean authorities' confrontational moves for war and realise 
the national conference, irrespective of denomination and order. 
  The statement expresses the hope that all religious 
organisations, clergymen and laymen the world over will extend 
unstinting support and encouragement to the Korean nation in the 
efforts to build a unified country of justice and peace with 
love and reconciliation.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- An 
Osaka prefectural meeting of Koreans in Japan was held at the 
Nakaosaka Korean Primary and Middle School on April 30 to 
denounce the suppression of the Osaka Organisation of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) by 
the Japanese authorities. 
  A statement of the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the 
DPRK was read out and O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of Chongnyon and chairman of the Osaka 
prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon, made a report at the 
meeting attended by more than 3,000 Chongnyon officials and 
Korean residents in Japan. 
  The reporter pungently denounced the large-scale suppression 
unprecedented in history by the Japanese police, branding the 
case as a grave hostile act against the DPRK and as an 
unjustifiable political suppression of Koreans in Japan and 
Chongnyon. 
  Japanese figures including the vice-chairman of the Osaka 
headquarters of the Japan Social-Democratic Party and a lawyer 
made solidarity speeches, which were followed by indignation 
speeches of representatives of Chongnyon and the Democratic 
Union of Korean Women in Japan. 
  The meeting adopted a resolution and elected delegates who 
would conduct a protest action against the Osaka Precfectural 
Police and the Higashi Police Station. 
  In connection with the outrages by the Osaka Prefectural 
Police, Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central 
Standing Committee of Chongnyon, and Kim Tae-hui, director of 
the International Department of the Chongnyon Central Standing 
Committee, on April 28 visited the headquarters of the Liberal 
Democratic Party and met the chairman of the Policy Affairs 
Research Council and deputy secretary-general of the party and 
handed them a request of the Chongnyon Central Standing 
Committee addressed to its President Yohei Kono. 
  On April 26, delegates of the Chongnyon Central Standing 
Committee visited the headquarters of the Komei Party to hand it 
a request addressed to its Chairman Koshi Ishida.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The Japanese 
reactionaries must ponder over the grave consequences arising 
from their unreasonable acts, stop the repression of the General 
Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and the 
Korean nationals in Japan and apologise for it, declares MINJU 
CHOSON today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  A sequence of savage repression by the Japanese 
reactionaries 
such as search of the hall of the Osaka prefectural headquarters 
of Chongnyon and its branch offices and the houses of senior 
officials is a heinous hostile act to wantonly infringe on the 
democratic rights of Koreans in Japan and stifle Chongnyon and 
an intolerable provocation against the DPRK. 
  Their repressive acts hitherto against Chongnyon and Koreans 
in Japan are countless, but there had been no such wholesale 
search and rampage as the recent one. This clearly shows their 
anti-Chongnyon, anti-DPRK campaign has reached a very grave 
stage. 
  Chongnyon is a dignified and authoritative organisation of 
overseas citizens of the DPRK which is engaged in righteous 
activities to defend the democratic national rights of Koreans 
in Japan, achieve the reunification of the country and promote 
friendship with the Japanese people. Therefore, there is no 
ground for Chongnyon to be the target of repression. 
  It is unpardonable for the Japanese authorities to join the 
United States and the South Korean puppets in the row over the 
"nuclear issue" of the DPRK and deliberately aggravate the 
situation, while resorting to vicious anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon 
acts. 
  Their reckless acts are aimed at blocking the legitimate 
activities of Chongnyon, controlling and restricting the life of 
Koreans in Japan and impairing the just peace policy of the DPRK 
at any cost. 
  However, it will bring into relief their inferiority and 
ferocity.

<F P=106> ["Japanese Authorities Urged To Give Up Projected `Law on </F>
the Case of Emergency'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 [dateline as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- 
The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) in a statement concerning 
the scheme of the Japanese Government authorities to enact "a 
law on the case of emergency" strongly demanded that the 
Japanese Government immediately renounce its hostile policy 
toward Korea and restrictions on and suppression of Korean 
residents in Japan and stop its reckless row for the enactment 
of the "law" defining the DPRK as an enemy. 
  Pointing out that the scheme of the Japanese Government is 
causing a serious crisis in the peace and stability not only on 
the Korean peninsula but also in Northeast Asia including Japan, 
the statement said: 
  It is well known to the world that the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea has made consistent efforts for peace and 
denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and for the building of 
a prosperous Asia, taking independence, peace and friendship as 
its diplomatic idea. 
  Ignoring this fact, the Japanese Government, while following 
the U.S. policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK, is trying to 
enact the law at any cost allegedly to cope with "a case of 
emergency on the Korean peninsula", regarding the campaign over 
the "suspected nuclear development" by the DPRK as the best 
chance. This shows that its hostile policy toward Korea has 
been carried into extremes. 
  The Japanese Government should ponder over what serious 
consequences will be entailed if it persists in its hostile 
policy toward Korea motivated by the intention to stage a 
comeback to Korea and in restrictions on and suppression of 
Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan, evading its 
responsibility for the past colonial rule over Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, May 1 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- A 
meeting was held in Tokyo on April 30 to commemorate the 40th 
anniversary of the founding of the Kuwol Sobang Publishing House. 
  Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), in his speech said that the 40-year-long path 
traversed by the Kuwol Sobang Publishing House was the course of 
loyalty and patriotism along which the publishing house, with 
the edition, publication and dissemination of the press of 
chuche-type, firmly armed the officials of Chongnyon and Koreans 
in Japan with the revolutionary ideas of the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim 
Chong-il, propagandized within and without the immortal chuche 
idea and the socialist homeland of chuche and greatly 
contributed to national reunification and the patriotic work of 
Chongnyon. 
  Kim Won-taek, director of the publishing house, in his 
report 
said that workers of the publishing house would make all their 
efforts to fulfil their heavy duty as a standard-bearer of the 
struggle for the development of the movement of Koreans in Japan 
in depth and a guide in the ideological education work of 
Chongnyon under the uplifted banner of the great chuche idea in 
response to the teachings of the great leader. 
  The meeting adopted a letter to Marshal Kim Chong-il.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- World political and 
public circles have expressed full support to the Korean 
people's struggle for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  Secretary general of the Central Committee of the Frelimo 
[Mozambique Liberation Front] Party Feliciano Salomao Gundana 
said when he received the Korean ambassador to his country on 
April 20 that he hoped that the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula would be solved peacefully through talks between the 
DPRK and the U.S. 
  The Korean people, he said, will win certainly in their 
struggle for a solution of the nuclear issue under the wise 
guidance of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The Zimbabwe-Korea Solidarity and Friendship Association and 
the Zimbabwean National Committee for the Study of the Chuche 
Idea in a joint statement April 7 urged the United States and 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to give up their 
schemings to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the fictitious 
"nuclear development" by the DPRK. 
  The statement said if the forces hostile to the DPRK try to 
fish in troubled waters after aggravating the situation on the 
Korean peninsula on purpose, it is a miscalculation. 
  A letter adopted at the annual meeting of the Ghana-DPRK 
Friendship Association which was held in Ghana on April 7 said 
the U.S. hostile policy of stifling the DPRK will end in 
failure, and urged the United States and the South Korean 
authorities to immediately stop their war provocation moves.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Under the wise guidance 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the Korean people and People's Army are 
defending the sovereignty of the country and the gains of 
socialism with honour, smashing the war manoeuvres of the 
imperialists and [words indistinct] general secretary of the 
Democratic Youth Federation of India, in an interview with the 
KCNA reporter in India on April 18 on the occasion of the 62nd 
founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army. 
  The general secretary said Comrade Kim Chong-il possessed of 
rare wisdom and outstanding ability of leadership, has not only 
built an invincible anthropocentric socialism based on the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses but 
also put forward unique idea and theory of Army building and 
consolidated the defences of the country as firm as rock. 
  The secret of the victory won by the Korean people and 
People's Army at every step in the decisive battle with U.S. 
imperialism and its allied force in recent years lies in the 
outstanding leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme 
commander of the Korean People's Army, who is possessed of iron 
will and matchless grit, he emphasized. 
  Saying that the acute situation created on the Korean 
peninsula is entirly attributable to the reckless military 
adventures and interference of the United States, he demanded 
that the U.S. withdraw its forces from South Korea, discontinue 
all forms of war rehearsals and stop the deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea at once.

<F P=106> ["Our Socialist Ideological Position is Impregnable" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The ideological front of 
our party, the socialist ideological position, will remain 
impregnable for ever as long as there are the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great master of the socialist press, and 
the unit of loyal journalists and pressmen who share the destiny 
with him, declares NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The paper devotes one whole page to an article on the 20th 
anniversary of the publication of a historical work by Comrade 
Kim Chong-il on May 7, 1974. 
  Reviewing the immortal exploits performed by him in guiding 
media services, the article says: 
  The dear leader who had wisely directed media services from 
his early years by creditably inheriting the tradition of media 
founded by the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song published 
the May 7 work and kindled the flame of revolutions in 
newspapers, news services and publications. 
  This occasioned a revolutionary change opening up a bright 
vista for the building of socialist media. 
  The paper says that Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great thinker 
and theoretician who fully propounded the idea of building 
socialist media of chuche. 
  The paper quotes Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "Our party's publications, news services and broadcasts have 
inherited the superb revolutionary traditions established by the 
great leader and are guided solely by the great leader's 
chuche-orientated idea on the media. Their noble aim is 
considered to be the advancement and accomplishment of the 
glorious revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader." 
  The paper further says: 
  The May 7 work is a powerful ideological weapon which 
enables 
our media to make an active contribution to modelling the whole 
society on the chuche idea. 
  In the work, the dear leader elucidated the character and 
basic mission of our party's media and set it as the basic 
principle of media services to adopt the principle of chuche as 
the fundamental, firmly establish the monolithic leadership 
system of the party and vigorously conduct the speed campaign 
with right seeds. And he gave comprehensive answers to 
questions arising in bringing about a revolutionary turn in 
media services and propaganda by making revolutions in 
newspapers, news services and publications. All these ideas, 
theories and policies laid down in the May 7 work served as a 
valuable press program which ushered in a heyday of socialist 
media as today. 
  Expounded in the dear leader's ideas and policies on media 
are all things ranging from the general orientation and basic 
duty of media to the characteristics of all kinds of items 
including editorials, articles, political essays and news 
briefs, the method of writing them and the mode of activities of 
editors and journalists. 
  Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is an illustrious leader who has 
triumphantly directed news media to apply the chuche-based press 
idea with his refined organising ability and energetic practical 
activities. 
  He solved all the important policy matters arising in media 
services, providing valuable ideological and theoretical pabulum 
which constitutes the contents of our media. 
  Whenever a heavy task was raised before the party and the 
revolution and the situation at home and abroad was grim, the 
dear leader showed deep interest in increasing the militant role 
of media and saw to it that a massive ideological offensive 
might be launched. 
  When the imperialists are frantically trying to incite the 
reactionary idea in the minds of the people and spread corrupt 
and decadent bourgeois way of life among them, our newspapers, 
news services, broadcasts and books are discharging their heavy 
mission as important media correctly speaking for and defending 
the ideas and stand of the Workers' Party of Korea and 
propagandizing and implementing its policies under the banner of 
the chuche idea, the banner of socialism, without the slightest 
vacillation. 
  All these are a precious fruition of the tested leadership 
art and powerful method of press campaign of the dear leader who 
has skillfully and superbly solved all the matters, firmly 
adhering to the chuche-based stand and revolutionary principle 
in the ideological and press campaign. 
  The dear leader general Kim Chong-il is an illustrious 
leader 
and teacher who has brought up a large army of revolutionary 
pressmen who are boundlessly loyal to the party and the 
revolution, the country and the people. 
  In our country, the relations between the leader and 
journalists, men of the press, are not merely relations of 
guiding and being guided, but relations between the great 
teacher and his disciples and between a tender-hearted father 
and his children. Lying in this blood ties, the steel-like 
singlehearted unity, are the greatest happiness and glory of our 
journalists, men of the press, and invincible might of our media. 
  United around the great general Kim Chong-il are all the 
officers and men of the People's Army with arms, 5 million youth 
vanguards resolved to become bullets and bombs and the ranks of 
faithful journalists, men of the press with iron faith and will, 
pens of the revolution tightly held in their hands. 
  No force on the earth can break the ranks of our 
journalists, 
men of the press, who resolutely defend him politically, 
ideologically and theoretically with absolute worship and 
loyalty and filial piety to their leader. As long as there are 
these iron ranks, our party's media will shine as media of the 
great Comrade Kim Chong-il forever.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The idea, theory and 
policies set forth by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in 
his historical letter "On Further Improving the Work of the 
Trade Unions" have displayed their great vitality in practice 
and their validity and attraction have been fully proven, says 
NODONG SINMUN today in a signed article devoted to the tenth 
anniversary of the publication of the letter. 
  In his work Comrade Kim Chong-il set forth the highly 
important tasks to build, strengthen and develop the trade 
unions including the tasks to push ahead with the three 
revolutions, ideological, technical and cultural, further 
enhance the role of trade union organizations in the socialist 
construction, firmly build up the trade union ranks and enhance 
the militant function of the trade union organizations. 
  Referring to the validity and vitality of the work, the 
article says: 
  They are evidently manifested in the fact that continued 
innovations and upswing are being effected in the socialist 
construction because, with the three revolutions successfully 
carried out, the Korean working class has been well prepared as 
faithful ranks which hold in esteem the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il in one mind of loyalty and filial piety, and the 
leading and vanguard role of the working class has been enhanced. 
  Technical and cultural revolutions, along with the 
ideological revolution, have been pushed ahead among the working 
class and trade union members. As a result, their technical and 
cultural standard is constantly increasing and their sense of 
duty and role in carrying out the technical revolution is 
growing more and more. 
  With the promotion of creative cooperation between workers 
and scientists and technicians, scientific and technical 
problems arising in putting the national economy on a 
chuche-oriented, modernized and scientific basis have been 
satisfactorily solved. Thus, the chuche character and 
independence of our industry have been consistently strengthened 
and production is going up at a fast speed. 
  Through the efforts to implement the idea and theory and 
policies set forth in the work, the party's economic policy 
propaganda and economic agitation have been activated and 
various forms of mass movements and socialist emulation drives 
have been dynamically conducted by the trade union organizations 
to powerfully encourage the working class and union members to 
the socialist economic construction. 
  In the flame of the socialist emulation drives our working 
class and trade union members made big innovative achievements 
in the fulfilment of the third seven-year plan and successfully 
carried out large-scale projects for the everlasting prosperity 
of the country. 
  The validity and vitality are also expressed in that the 
trade union ranks have been firmly built up and their militant 
function and role enhanced considerably, the article says.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The long-distance 
pipeline for the transport of headings is greatly contributing 
to keeping iron and steel production on a high level at the Kim 
Chaek Iron and Steel Complex. 
  The pipeline, with an annual transport capacity of 2 million 
tons, has carried tens of millions of tons of headings after its 
commissioning. 
  Laid in 1975, it stretches 98 kilometres from the Musan iron 
ore mine, North Hamgyong Province, in the northernmost region of 
Korea, to the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex, a metallurgical 
giant in Chongjin. 
  By carrying a large portion of iron headings to the complex, 
the pipeline lessens the burden of rails and motors. 
  Technicians and workers have laid double lines in the 
steepest 8 km-long section across the Kumpae ridge and improved 
the equipment for a higher rate of operation. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song initiated the laying 
of this pipeline to fully solve the problem of iron heading 
transport in keeping with the increasing production capacity at 
the Musan mining complex and the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel 
Complex, and wisely led the work. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il took all necessary 
measures such as the supply of equipment and building machines 
so that the construction of the long-distance pipeline for the 
transport of headings could be finished in a short time. 
  And he sent many latest equipment and facilities after the 
construction of the transport pipeline so that it could fully 
display its potential.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the 
Central Committee of the General Federation of the Unions of 
Literature and Arts of Korea called upon all the literary and 
art organizations, patriotic writers and artists in South Korea 
and abroad aspiring after national independence and 
reunification of the country to make a bold decision to 
participate in a national conference and actively lead other 
political parties, organizations and individual figures to join 
them. 
  In a statement today the spokesman said the Kim Yong-sam 
group's opposition to the proposal of a national conference 
initiated by a joint meeting of the DPRK Government, political 
parties and public organizations is, in essence, intended to 
conceal their flunkeyist, treacherous nature and monopolize 
North-South dialogue. 
  "The South Korean authorities claiming to be 'civilian' have 
blocked all dialogues and contacts between political parties, 
organizations and individual personages," the spokesman said, 
adding: "This clearly shows that they do not want national 
reconciliation and unity but seek to prolong their remaining 
days as henchmen of outside forces."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Kumsong tideland 
reclamation, one more creation of eternal value, has been 
successfully completed in Korea by People's Army [KPA] soldiers 
mobilized in peaceful construction and builders. 
  A great nature-remaking project for damming up a wide sea 
extending scores of ri along the West Coast from Kwangnyang Bay 
to Kumsong-ri in Onchon County, South Pyongan Province, has been 
completed to obtain 3,300 hectares of arable land. 
  Hundreds of hectares of paddy fields have already been 
adjusted as a standardized field like a checker board, 
irrigation and drainage waterways to prevent damages from 
drought, flood and brine forever and roads extending tens of 
kilometres have been built. 
  Paddy fields have been divided into fields of 25 hectares 
each. This year will witness the first farming in these fields. 
  A ceremony for the completion of the Kumsong tideland 
reclamation took place on the spot on April 27. 
  Vice Marshal Choe Kwang, Politburo member of the Central 
Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and chief of the 
General Staff of the Korean People's Army, conveyed a message 
of thanks of the C.C. [Central Committee], the WPK at the 
ceremony. 
  The message highly estimated the KPA soldiers and builders 
for their indomitable spirit and shining feats performed in the 
large- scale nature-remaking project with the unshakable faith 
that they have nothing impossible under the wise leadership of 
the party.

CSO 

  [Excerpts] At the Light Industry Committee's Garment 
Research Center 
  A little while ago, we visited a garment research center 
which has set out to realize the policy of putting light 
industry first. We were filled with joy that there, upholding 
the Great Leader's New Year's Address, new garment research 
results are being produced which will give great joy to our 
people, who are pressing forward the overall advance of 
Socialism. [passage omitted] 
  The Dear Leader Comrade Kim Chong-il pointed out the 
following. 
  "The garment-research enterprise will have to be done well 
for the specialization of clothing production, for ceaselessly 
developing processing technology, and for setting up a clothing 
system well suited for the Socialist mode of living and the 
figures of the Korean people." 
  Our first stop was the Materials Research Office. Office 
director Comrade Pyong Kwang-chol set out very thin copper leaf 
[tongbakpan]. We found out that it was the material for a mold 
to make a cylindrical metallic screen [kumsok wontong chaebon], 
the heart of the adhesive lining machine [chopchak simji kigye]. 
  Lining forms the skeleton of clothing. Early on, our 
scientists and chemical-factory workers were successful in 
taking materials plentiful in or country and making them high 
grade using chemical methods. Thus, the garment industry has 
made easy use of clothes lining made from weaving lining 
material, pasting it to any fabric with an adhesive developed 
our way. 
  The research center did not stop at this. Last year it newly 
developed an efficient adhesive lining machine capable of 
meeting the nationwide demand for lining with just one machine. 
Completing its design, the research center turned it over to a 
weaving-machine factory. Even so, the office decided to make and 
guarantee the cylindrical metallic screen itself. This was 
because among lining machines, the cylindrical metallic screen, 
which holds the adhesive and sprays it on fabric, is a part very 
difficult to manufacture. 
  During the first week of the new year, the Materials 
Research 
Office brought about collective reform, creating the mold 
material for the screen. Displaying their revolutionary spirit 
of self-reliant innovation, the members of this office, 
including researcher Comrade Yi Sang-chun, devoted themselves to 
manufacturing a screen mold with this material. We too became 
confident that if the cylindrical metallic screen was completed 
by the end of March, as they resolved, an adhesive lining 
machine would easily be born in time for the holidays of April. 
  We entered the room where the automated clothing-design 
research collective works. Office director Comrade Sim 
Pang-hyang introduced us to a young researcher absorbed in 
assembling electronic elements in the middle of the room, which 
had large and small pieces of modern electronic equipment 
installed around the room like folding screens. It was computer 
expert Comrade Nam Sung-il, winner of the Beacon Award for New 
Technological Innovation. 
  Adopting the computer to tailoring technology in our own 
way, 
he developed a new type of automated body-measuring apparatus, 
technologically more modern and also suited to the figures of 
Koreans. Put on display in the Three Revolutions Exhibition 
Hall, it is getting people's attention. When a person enters and 
stands in the automated body-measuring apparatus, the form of 
his or her body is automatically measured by a television 
camera. While this is happening, an appropriate clothing pattern 
is drawn by a computer. All the cutter has to do is take this 
and cut the fabric. 
  However, unsatisfied with this and determined to follow the 
Great Leader's New Year's Address, the clothing-design research 
collective began a research project of a higher stage for the 
most precise automated design of clothing form, using a 
three-dimensional design method, in accordance with people's 
preferences and demands. 
  Within the research collective beat devoted hearts of 
loyalty, working to gloriously realize the lofty purpose of the 
Great Leader and the Dear Leader, who with tremendous love and 
care concern themselves with clothing the people in smart, 
good-looking clothes. Researchers Comrade Yi Kyong-sun and 
Comrade Yang Il-sun in particular worked hard to guarantee the 
scientific character of materials analysis, adopting new 
analytical methods from the analysis of body-measurement data on 
Koreans accumulated over a long period. They thus created a 
breakthrough capable of advancing to the middle of January 
completion of the enormous task of data analysis. 
  Immediately upon completion of data analysis, the research 
collective will make clothing patterns appropriate for male 
figures by the February holidays, and clothing patterns 
appropriate for female figures by the April holidays. They set 
up bold objectives for the time after that, to be of service to 
residents by making various other types of clothing patterns. We 
drew a picture of the level of clothing-manufacturing service to 
be provided to our people when this objective is realized. 
  Next, we stopped by the Process Research Office. 
  Office director Comrade Sim Chun-chan laid open a thick data 
book entitled, Clothing Manufacturing Time Handbook 
[Oskagongsi Pyollam]. The numbers filling every page, even 
at first glance, seemed to speak of the hard research and 
thinking devoted by the scientists of this place. 
  Precisely stipulating manufacturing time by clothing product 
type and clothing part was presented as an important requirement 
for further raising production efficiency and product quality, 
by guaranteeing balance between production processes in garment 
factories. In order to solve this problem, office members, 
including researcher Comrade Chong Kun-myong and testing 
technician Comrade Kim Chae-ok, for several years went to 
garment factories in Pyongyang, Kanggye, and Hamhung, passing 
around machine tools directly. Taking scientific measurements of 
the manufacturing time of the numerous types of clothing and 
clothing parts, they put together a data book. 
  This became a precious reference work for garment-factory 
workers. In keeping with the great leader's New Year's Address, 
the researchers united their strength and wisdom to enable 
workers to easily and widely make use of this data book. 
  This was the creation of programs capable of determining 
clothing-manufacturing time by product type using computers. 
[passage omitted] 
  Going around visiting the Computer Research Office and 
various other units, we were able to gain the certainty that, 
with the interest and backing of the Light Industry Committee, 
the scientists of this place will realize the policy of putting 
light industry first and will greatly contribute with scientific 
knowledge and technology to improving the dress of our people.

  [Text] The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has 
asked the Thai Government to freeze the assets of a Chat Thai MP 
which were suspected to have been acquired through illicit drug 
trafficking, a senior official of the Office of Narcotics 
Control Board (ONCB) disclosed yesterday. 
  The source said the DEA made the request last year. It also 
supplied the ONCB with evidence allegedly linking Nakhon Phanom 
MP Thanong Siriprichaphong with several marijuana seizures in 
the United States. 
  US officials maintained that the MP's assets could be 
sequestrated according to the US-Thai Mutual Legal Assistance 
Treaty (MLAT) agreement in 1992 and the instruments of 
ratification. 
  The source said Mr Thanong's assets in the United States, 
including a house on the East Coast, had been seized a few years 
ago. 
  The official said Mr Thanong had been notified of the US 
action and asked to travel to the United States to defend 
himself, but he had yet to do so. 
  The Nakhon Phanom MP was not available for comment yesterday 
and attempts to contact him were not successful. 
  The DEA request and evidence were passed on to the Office of 
the Supreme Attorney-General about two months ago for 
consideration to determine if they were substantial enough to 
warrant the sequestration of the MP's assets. 
  If this is approved, it will be the first sequestration in 
Thai history of assets suspected to have been acquired through 
narcotics trafficking. 
  The senior ONCB official said Mr Thanong had been kept under 
close watch by undercover anti-narcotics agents for a long time 
after some arrested drugs traffickers had implicated him. 
  However, he said there had been no hard evidence to show the 
MP was directly involved in the illicit drugs trade. 
  When asked about the DEA request, Interior Minister Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut said yesterday he had not yet been informed about 
the US action. 
  He said the Thai Government was ready to cooperate fully 
with 
Washington. But he noted that the suspect must be treated 
fairly and Thai officials should not listen only to the US side 
of the story. 
  Chat Thai Party leader Praman Adireksan and 
secretary-general 
Banhan Sinlapa-acha declined to comment yesterday, saying they 
had not yet been formally informed about the DEA request. 
  But Chat Thai MP Samphan Loetnuwat dismissed the report as a 
"mere rumor" aimed at discrediting the party. 
  Chat Thai deputy leader Thawit Klinprathum said the case was 
a personal affair and had nothing to do with the party. 
  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said he had no details 
about 
the charges and did not know enough facts to comment on the case. 
  But he added that Mr Thanong had not yet been arrested and 
formally charged, and therefore the evidence had to be shown 
first before Thailand could decide whether or not to go ahead 
with legal proceedings. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong said there would have to 
be 
specific plaintiffs and witnesses in the case, but at the moment 
Mr Thanong was considered innocent until proven guilty. 
  New Aspiration Party deputy secretary-general Prasong 
Bunphong who lost to Mr Thanong in the last election, yesterday 
urged the MP to show up and clear himself. 
  Mr Prasong, a former Nakhon Phanom MP, also called on 
Parliament President Marut Bunnak to investigate the case. 
  Deputy Interior Minister Den Tomina, however, said he would 
find out about the case from US officials when he visits the 
United States tomorrow. 
  As chairman of the Interior Ministry's Drug Suppression 
Committee, Mr Den said he would visit the DEA office and make 
enquiries about the case. 
  He said that if the DEA had sufficient evidence against the 
suspect, it should ask Thai officials to make the arrest. 
  Some Thai legislators have been on the DEA's watchlist for 
suspected involvement in drug trafficking. In 1976, three 
former MPs, Chumphon Maninet, Nisit Wetsiriyanan and Manit 
Phrommanon were arrested in Hong Kong with one kilogram of 
heroin. Mr Nisit was acquitted but the two other politicians 
together with another Thai, Pricha Liyarak, were sentenced to 
ten years in prison.

  [Text] Police yesterday denied a news report that they 
plan to arrest a former drug adviser to former US President 
Jimmy Carter, who reportedly became involved with Burmese opium 
warlord Khun Sa. 
  A newspaper yesterday quoted Lt Col Suphachai Sirisap, 
deputy 
chief of the Foreign Affairs Division, as saying police will 
arrest Peter Bourne when they see him. 
  He also was quoted as saying that Bourne, a former adviser 
on 
narcotics to the Carter administration, appeared to have crossed 
into Burma illegally from Thailand. 
  Bourne, 60, was relieved of his job as presidential adviser 
on narcotics after allegedly abusing his position, according to 
the report. 
  Lt Col Suphachai said yesterday he had never been 
interviewed 
as reported by the newspaper. 
  "I don't know about the issue at all. The report has damaged 
my reputation," he said. 
  Suphachai said he told reporters that any country wanting 
Thailand to arrest a foreigner must first contact the Foreign 
Ministry, which would then inform the Interior Ministry. The 
Interior Ministry would consider whether to order the Police 
Department to take legal action.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kawi Chongkittithawon: "Gains for Thailand </F>
in Cambodian Peace Talks"] 
  [Text] There are good reasons for Thailand to host the 
Round Table for Peace and National Reconciliation between Phnom 
Penh and the Khmer Rouge. 
  The most important of these is the credibility of Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai, which remains intact despite the fact 
that, almost without exception, his subordinates, including 
Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, have made comments harmful to 
Thai-Cambodian relations. 
  Although beset with domestic problems, Chuan should not 
remain idle over such an important foreign policy issue. 
  The prime minister, still respected to some degree by 
Cambodian leaders, should take this opportunity to offer 
Thailand, specifically Phatthaya or Hua Hin, as a neutral venue 
for peace talks. 
  In July 1991, a similar feeling of despair over peace 
prospects prevailed among Cambodian leaders. Then Thai Prime 
Minister Anan Panyarachun, equally burdened with domestic issues 
at the time, agreed to host the historic Phatthaya peace talks 
which led to the signing of the Paris peace accords. For Anan, 
it was a great risk, but it was one that paid off. 
  Last week, King Norodom Sihanouk suggested Paris or Jakarta 
as possible venues for the roundtable. In principle, these two 
locations are ideal as France and Indonesia were cochairmen of 
the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which brought an 
end to the conflict in that country. However, in practice, it 
is still very difficult to see how the proposed talks could take 
place there. It would be too costly and too far away. 
  As Cambodia's next door neighbour, Thailand should take up 
the challenge to host the meeting and help the Cambodian 
factions achieve national reconciliation as soon as possible. 
Otherwise, the ongoing fighting between the Cambodian and Khmer 
Rouge troops would continue to affect the Thai villagers at the 
border and worse, it could draw Thailand into the undesirable 
war -- especially at a time when the Thai military leaders are 
extremely frustrated with the border situation. 
  More than ever before, Thailand can play a useful role in 
the 
upcoming talks among the Cambodian faction. Since the 
UN-sponsored election in May last year, which led to the 
formulation of the current Cambodian government, Thailand has 
been labelled as a pariah, primarily because of its relations 
with the Khmer Rouge. The country has been repeatedly condemned 
for its past links with the Marxist group. This trend will 
continue as long as Thailand's lackadaisical attitude towards 
the issue remains unchanged. 
  By hosting the peace talks, Thailand can demonstrate its 
goodwill and neutrality, even though it will still be tough to 
convince all the parties involved. If needs be, the Thai 
authorities can take the opportunity to answer the allegations 
levelled against the country. 
  Furthermore, Thai leaders would have the chance to exchange 
views with all the Cambodian leaders on their own soil. They 
can settle past misunderstandings, deliberate or not, and begin 
a new dialogue to build up mutual trust and confidence. 
  In the past, Thailand frequently acted as an intermediary in 
the Cambodian conflict, but that was when the country still had 
the creditability. As Chuan is the only Thai leader with such 
credentials, it is only an overture from him that will overcome 
the Cambodians' recalcitrance and hold the roundtable in 
Thailand. 
  Chuan should play a positive role in forging a 
reconciliation 
in Cambodia as it would greatly boost Thailand's wounded 
international image. Helping Cambodia is to help Thailand. For 
too long, the Cambodian situation has been handled by an 
arrogant and myopic foreign minister, who has failed to 
understand the sensitivities of the Cambodian issue or even 
muster support from within the military. What the country needs 
most now is a show of assertiveness from Chuan in foreign policy 
because it is he who commands the respect of the military 
leaders, and he who could make a difference in shaping 
Thailand's Cambodian policy. Thailand has a high stake in the 
future of a Cambodia which is at peace and friendly. Bangkok's 
current problems with the Cambodian government have been the 
accumulative result of developments that go back two decades. 
More specifically, since 1979, Thailand has enjoyed all the 
possible advantages from the war-shattered economy of Cambodia, 
now it is the time to pay something back. 
  It is useless to continue this poisonous war of words. The 
fate of these two countries are sealed together like a Siamese 
twin. They have to learn how to coexist and coordinate with one 
another, otherwise both of them will suffer a slow death.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday urged 
Cambodians to discuss their problems and called on outsiders to 
refrain from interfering. 
  "As long as there is no reconciliation among Cambodians, 
fighting will continue," Squadron Leader Prasong said. 
  "Other countries should not encourage division among them 
(Cambodians) or extend military support for them to fight each 
other," he added. 
  The minister reaffirmed support for a Round Table among the 
Cambodians but stressed that Thailand would not be involved in 
the peace talks. 
  "The Round Table has nothing to do with Thailand," he said. 
"The whole affair is a matter for the Cambodians in which we do 
not want to be involved," he added. 
  Thailand would extend economic, social or health assistance 
to Cambodia but will not intervene in the country's political 
affairs, he said. 
  As for fighting spilling over the border into Thailand, the 
minister said military authorities had been able to compile 
damage estimates so that the Foreign Ministry can file a report 
to the Cambodian government.

  [Text] Military leaders yesterday warned that a proposed 
drop in the Defense Ministry's budget growth would seriously 
affect arms acquisition programs and compromise the country's 
self-defense capability. 
  They were speaking after the Cabinet approved a balanced 
budget of Baht [Thai currency] 715 billion for fiscal 1995, with 
strong emphasis on accelerating rural development, improving 
education and increasing the standard of living of lower 
socioeconomic groups. 
  The Defense Ministry saw its proposed budget growing by 7.5 
percent, a drop of 0.5 percent compared with the current fiscal 
year. Some military leaders complained that the new budget 
would adversely affect self-defense capability. 
  Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak said after the Cabinet 
meeting 
that the slower growth in the proposed defense budget would 
definitely affect the Armed Forces arms acquisition programs. 
  "The Defense Ministry will discuss it with the Budget 
Bureau," Gen Wichit said. 
  ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Prachet Siridet, the Navy 
Commander-in-Chief, said the defense budget could not be cut 
without the national security being compromised. "However, it 
depends how much of a cut there will be." 
  The Navy chief insisted that the Armed Forces had drawn up 
their budget proposals they deserved. 
  Cabinet sources said the Defense Ministry had indicated it 
would register reservations about the 1995 budget, reasoning 
that the bulk would be spent on arms purchases and a shortfall 
in funds would affect its program of modernization. 
  Baht 256 billion, a 22.4 percent increase over the current 
fiscal year, would be pumped into these projects which are 
considered by the government to be top priority. 
  The Cabinet appointed Deputy Prime Ministers Banyat 
Banthatthan, Amnuai Wirawan, Bunchu Rotchanasathian, and 
Supachai Phanitchaphak to scrutinize and adjust the allocations 
earmarked for government agencies under their control, Budget 
Bureau Director Bodi Chunnanon said. The four would discuss 
proposed adjustments on May 17. 
  The proposed budget for secret operations would be given to 
the Customs Department, the Office of the Counter Corruption 
Commission and the National Intelligence Agency, Bodi said. The 
total secret fund would represent only 0.1 percent of the total 
budget, he added. 
  Bodi said adjustments could be made but total public sector 
expenditure would remain fixed at Baht 715 billion. 
  The national budget for fiscal 1995 will be finalized by the 
Cabinet on May 31, he said. 
  Bodi said that in fiscal 1995 each of the 360 members of the 
House of Representatives would be allocated about Baht 1O 
million to finance community development projects in their 
respective constituencies. 
  Of the Baht 1O million, Baht 5 million would be funnelled 
through the Prime Minister's Office of the Secretary General. 
The other half would be made available through various 
government agencies involved in development work. 
  MPs had been allocated Baht 20 million each for community 
development in the current financial year which ends September 
30. 
  Bodi said the figures would probably be adjusted upwards 
when 
the House of Representatives debates the Budget Bill. 
  The Budget Bureau chief said the reason the defense budget 
was not being increased at the same percentage rate as in fiscal 
1995 was because the Defense Ministry had been given more than 
enough in the current financial year and still had funds left to 
spend.

<F P=106> [Article by Thuan Thanh: "Militancy and the Power of </F>
Persuasion in the Current Ideological Work"] 
  [Text] Ours is a militant and revolutionary party. 
Therefore, its ideological work must display high militancy and 
great power of persuasion. At turning points -- especially when 
the revolutionary cause enjoys new opportunities and also faces 
great difficulties and challenges -- there is a greater need for 
ideological work to meet high militancy requirements. Under 
such circumstances, efforts must be made to point out the 
advantages and difficulties; shed light on the profound and new 
character of the problems encountered; adopt timely action to 
get rid of all indications of subjectivism, pessimism, 
oscillation, faltering faith, and erroneous concepts regarding 
policies and lines; and take firm steps to lay bare and 
effectively cope with sabotage by hostile forces on the 
ideological front. 
  Since the sixth party congress, the national and 
international situations have become very complicated and put 
our party's ideological work through a very stringent test. A 
socioeconomic crisis began in the late seventies and early 
eighties and lasted for many consecutive years. The situation 
became more precarious from 1986-1988 when inflation developed 
at a galloping pace. Then 1991 witnessed the crumbling of the 
former Soviet Union and a number of socialist countries. Our 
country faced another dangerous challenge. 
  Nonetheless, our party has demonstrated its political 
steadfastness and persisted along the socialist path. Thanks to 
its spirit of independence, sovereignty, and creativeness, our 
party has helped our people tide over great challenges, stand 
firmly on their own feet, and begin to shift to a new 
development stage. 
  The events of recent years have provided us with new 
knowledge and experiences regarding militancy and the power of 
persuasion in ideological work. 
  Nevertheless, our militancy and power of persuasion in 
ideological work have not been upgraded in an even manner to 
meet our high requirements. There are still instances in which 
cadres, party members, and people fail to adopt a clear-cut 
attitude, heighten vigilance, and fully realize the acts of 
sabotage by hostile forces aimed at getting rid of the party and 
socialist regime in our country. A number of cadres and party 
members still look on with indifference in the face of the 
enemy's erroneous concepts and attempts to instigate the people 
and cause disturbances. Others oscillate when confronted with 
the need to persist along the socialist path, or worse still, 
want to follow a different path. Efforts have been made on the 
ideological and theoretical fronts. Nonetheless, because our 
efforts still do not meet the high militancy requirements, the 
results obtained are not effective enough to provide timely and 
eloquent solutions to problems arising from real life 
situations. Many cadres and party members, including leading 
cadres, are still too lazy to learn... Dissension still exerts a 
very heavy impact in a number of party organizations. 
  Now that the revolution has reached a new turning point, the 
militancy requirements of ideological work are reflected through 
the following points: 
  -- It is necessary to safeguard the essential problems 
concerning the revolutionary cause. They include the 
"ideological and theoretical foundations, political goals and 
lines, and the nature of party leadership..." As far as the 
aforementioned problems are concerned, ideological work must 
meet the high militancy requirements and must give top priority 
to efforts to work out problem-solving methods. 
  -- It is important to uphold the high militancy in our 
ideological work. The current situation requires theoretical 
work to begin first so that orientations can be set. Because 
the real life situations are too new to understand, though, many 
problems need to be clarified. The militancy in the ideological 
work must be reflected through one's assertiveness, ability to 
make early predictions and be sensitive to new developments, 
determination to make bold studies, and courage to deal with 
unprecedented problems while at the same time taking precautions 
against disorientation. 
  -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party lines and 
resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly, display 
single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation 
measures. Efforts must be made to overcome weaknesses arising 
from subjectivism and internal dissension that are likely to 
develop at turning points. It is important to make sure that 
words match deeds and yield effective results. Efforts must be 
made to do away with poor work organization and skepticism, 
because these drawbacks exert a negative impact on militant 
activities. 
  -- Make sustained efforts to educate cadres and party 
members 
so they can grasp new opportunities while at the same time 
helping to safeguard and develop the political stalwartness of 
each cadre, party member, and individual citizen. 
  The militancy in ideological work covers concrete contents 
based on the specific requirements and tasks of each of the 
revolution's development stages. The aforementioned 
requirements and tasks have already been clearly defined by the 
midterm national party conference and the conference on 
ideological and cultural work in early 1994. 
  Based on the aforementioned orientations, the militancy in 
ideological work must be patterned after a number of key 
ideological concepts. It is necessary to uphold the spirit of 
independence, sovereignty, and self-sufficiency and self-help. 
At the same time, it is important to criticize and help 
overcome the bad practices of waiting for help from the outside 
world or relying on subsidies from the state or upper echelons. 
As far as ideological work is concerned, efforts must be made 
to discover and encourage examples of success made possible by 
the spirit of self-sufficiency and self-help in the framework of 
the renovation cause of our party and people. It is necessary 
to learn selectively from mankind's achievements and from other 
countries' experiences and apply them to the actual situation in 
Vietnam in a correct and creative manner. Timely measures must 
be taken to check and overcome slavish imitation and dogmatism, 
which always does more harm than good to the revolutionary 
undertaking, no matter where it comes from. Here military 
spirit is reflected through the will to act and free oneself 
from poverty, dependence, and the danger of being left behind. 
  It is important to promote the sense of industry, thrift, 
honesty, and righteousness. Practicing thrift to serve the 
cause of national construction and defense is a major policy 
designed by our party to mobilize and make effective use of all 
available resources to develop the national industrialization 
and modernization program a further step. We must carry out the 
ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the 
following: -- It is necessary for everyone to grasp party 
lines and resolutions fully and understand them thoroughly, 
display single-mindedness, and develop consistent implementation 
measures. Efforts must be made to overcome weaknesses arising 
from subjectivism and internal dissension that are likely to

designed by our party to mobilize and make effective use of all 
available resources to develop the national industrialization 
and modernization program a further step. We must carry out the 
ideological struggle on a long-term basis, bearing in mind the 
need to make persistent and meticulous efforts to turn our 
ideological concept into a lifestyle for all members of society 
to follow. As an immediate objective, it is necessary to 
condemn resolutely the waste or loss of public funds and use of 
budget allocations on extravagant spending sprees, lavish 
parties, gifts, and unnecessary equipment. Measures must be 
taken to put an end to the bad practice of spending beyond the 
limits set by our economic growth rate. 
  Strategically speaking, it is very important to grasp 
opportunities, eliminate dangers, and overcome challenges to 
shift the country gradually to a new development stage and 
accelerate the renovation undertaking, which is aimed at making 
the people rich and the country powerful and at building an 
equal and civilized society. Therefore, it is necessary to 
understand this strategically important concept thoroughly and 
apply it to the current situation to accelerate our country's 
renovation undertaking. 
  This means that it is now possible for the militancy in 
ideological work to shift from a defensive position to an 
offensive position, take the upper hand, and move forward. 
  Ideological work must be carried out in a confident manner 
and with new enthusiasm. Refresher training programs on the 
party's concepts and lines must be held so that cadres and party 
members can enhance their knowledge; be firm in the nation's 
choice of the socialist path; study their appropriate adaptation 
and development of Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought in 
the new situation; and discover and resolutely rectify incorrect 
conceptions, vague interpretation, and ideological deviation to 
counter opportunistic, rightist, dogmatic, and conservative 
manifestations. It is necessary to discover early and fight 
uncompromisingly against deviations in outlining lines and 
policies and executing the party's lines and policies, which may 
lead to aberrations in the socialist path. We have to criticize 
and analyze incorrect conceptions and hostile allegations in 
society quickly and correctly. 
  The heavy losses suffered by many ruling communist parties 
in 
the past provide us with a profound lesson in party building 
tasks. It is a lesson about the danger of erroneous lines; 
violations of the principles of the party's organization and 
activity; mistakes in selecting and deploying cadres, especially 
key cadres; and the practice of bureaucracy and staying aloof 
from the public. It is also a lesson for us about enhancing the 
party's intellect, logic, and political capacity; uniting in 
ideology; and preserving the fine quality of party cadres and 
party members. 
  In August 1989, the party Central Committee directly stated 
that many party organs, leading cadres, and party members have 
been lax in their ideological tasks. They lack a fighting 
spirit against deviate ideas and conceptions and incorrect 
actions and statements. They are showing poor responsibility in 
the fight for the socialist ideology. 
  This situation has been corrected and overcome in one step. 
The militancy in ideological work has been further restored and 
enhanced. We need to clearly realize our shortcomings, though, 
including very severe ones. 
  In many party installations, the education, control, and 
management work of party members has been undermined by 
irregular and poor party activities. The idealism of some party 
members has faded. Their fighting power has decreased. Some 
have plunged into the practice of individualism, opportunism, 
and pragmatism. They take advantage of loopholes in party and 
state policies and management structures to practice corruption 
and get rich illegally. They have become depraved and 
degenerated. Some cadres are preoccupied with sectionalism and 
factionalism. They fight for higher positions and personal 
interests, thus severely affecting the party unity. 
  Facing this situation, the ideological work of party 
installations must not be evasive, yielding, or rightist. The 
improvement of ideological and political quality starts with 
strengthening the spirit of criticism and fighting based on the 
party's conceptions and stands. The fighting spirit is badly 
needed in the current activities of party installations. 
  At the moment, the fighting spirit also requires more study 
efforts by the entire party as well as every party cadre and 
party member. Our party is a vanguard party; at the moment, 
more than any other time, party members must improve their 
intelligence level. If a party member does not want to study 
for his own advancement, he cannot improve his knowledge and 
assume a leading role. 
  The militant character requires that control over the 
implementation of the party's lines, policies, and statutes be 
strengthened. We have to overcome situations where 
implementation does not comply with resolutions, words do not 
agree with actions, and the practice of many cadres who remain 
silent in conferences but whose deeds are always at variance 
with party resolutions. In the current situation, political 
determination, loyalty to party ideals, and devotion to serving 
the interests of laborers and people should be considered the 
most essential characteristics of a party member. They are also 
guiding concepts in the task of heightening the militant and 
compelling characteristics of ideological work. 
  Ideological work implies the task of building trust. It 
requires high motivational and persuasive abilities that can 
work effectively on people's wills and emotions. A very 
persuasive character leads to a strong, sharp, and effective 
militant spirit. The militancy in ideological work, therefore, 
requires self-education and self-criticism by every individual 
in order to better their implementation. The struggle on the 
ideological and theoretical fronts can only succeed if every 
cadre seriously contemplates the essential issues in the party's 
viewpoints and political lines, then draws the logical 
conclusions and makes necessary and positive adjustment in 
conception and viewpoint. 
  Nowadays, social democratization is expanding, people's 
knowledge is increasing quickly, and public media and other 
information sources have become very rich and diversified. 
These changes update human thinking very rapidly, increase 
cultural interaction enormously, and make social disparity 
wider. Therefore, ideological work should not be carried out in 
outdated ways and its militancy should not be conceived and 
developed as before. Reality demands that the current 
ideological work should be highly compelling; a characteristic 
our struggle on the ideology front should strive to achieve 
through persuasion, not coercion and pressure. 
  Our ideological work, therefore, should be renovated toward 
widening democracy and increasing the volume of information in 
practical and suitable forms for different types of target 
groups. It should also allow more dialogue and open debate. The 
innovative spirit should be developed among party members and 
cadres. The tasks of criticizing and evaluating viewpoints 
should be carried out properly, but not in a rough and coercive 
manner that prevents independent thinking. 
  The militant and compelling character of ideological work 
must be built through discussion and debate on contradicting 
opinions and viewpoints in order to obtain eventual profound 
agreement with the party's lines and viewpoints. 
Democratization should be implemented along with careful 
observation of party discipline and order, and with a high sense 
of responsibility by party members. Distinctions should be made 
between people who observe organizational discipline and order 
but hold the wrong viewpoint because of their low level of 
understanding and knowledge, and those who intentionally breach 
party discipline and carry out evil deeds. 
  The methods and forms of political activities must be 
diversified regularly. We should not only convey the contents 
of resolutions, but also encourage the raising of issues and 
provide all the necessary information and material. We should 
compare the party's viewpoints and policies with reality, thus 
helping people -- through thought and discussion in a frank and 
democratic atmosphere -- solve for themselves any confusions in 
their viewpoints.

<F P=106> [By Jesse Torres Jr.] </F>
  [Text] A large group from the underground Christians for 
National Liberation (CNL) bolted from the National Democratic 
Front (NDF) this week. 
  The breakaway group composed of priests, pastors, nuns and 
seminarians from the National Capital Region (NCR) have also 
formed the Organisasyon ng mga Kristiyano para sa Sambayanan 
(OIKOS) [Organization of Christians for the People]. 
  "We are tired of the endless debate," OIKOS secretary 
general, Reverend Librado Espiritu, told Philippine News and 
Features (PNF). "It hinders our work from moving on. We believe 
we have to make a new organization and redefine roles." 
  In a statement issued at its founding congress, OIKOS blamed 
those loyal to exiled Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) 
leader Jose Maria Sison for destroying the CNL. OIKOS said "the 
free space of intelligent, sober and comradely debate (in the 
underground movement) has become a suffocating vacuum." The 
statement also said "the noble CNL of 1972 has become a 
subservient slave in 1994." 
  Espiritu explained that OIKOS is not "another force" in the 
leftist split, but a "distinct group" that offers an 
alternative. OIKOS recognizes the history, tradition, heritage 
and action of the CNL, Espiritu said. 
  OIKOS is Greek for household. It is the root word for 
economics, ecology and ecumenism. In its biblical meaning, it 
covers the whole inhabited world. 
  One of the most influential NDF member-organizations, the 
CNL 
recently split into pro-Sison and anti-Sison factions. Last 
week, Reverend Felipe Patricio, CNL national chairperson joined 
other NDF officials who have "rejected' the leadership of NDF 
chief Manuel Romero and spokesperson Luis Jalandoni. Former 
priest Jalandoni was himself a former CNL member. 
  Despite the break, OIKOS adopted several of CNL's 
"fundamental tasks" including armed revolution. The group said 
it will continue to build mass bases, and serve in communities. 
It will also continue to aim to "unite Christians in the 
revolutionary movement" and help in its advance. 
  Felipe de San Jose, former secretary general of CNL in Metro 
Manila, said OIKOS will help broaden, the "united front" and 
mobilize support for the revolution "under the leadership of the 
proletariat, not necessarily the CPP." 
  San Jose said OIKOS will engage in parliamentary struggle, 
stressing that this is not secondary to armed struggle. "We 
don't want to equate revolution with war. We launched a 
revolution to stop war and the causes of war," he told PNF. He 
said five OIKOS members were running in the 9 May barangay 
[village] elections. 
  OIKOS believes in a "theology of wholeness," in contrast to 
the theologies of liberation and struggle popularly espoused by 
Christian activists, San Jose called this a balancing of faith 
and ideology. "What we are after" he said, "is the goal, the 
vision of a society where there is equality and fraternity," 
beyond the victory of the revolution. 
  Meanwhile, CNL spokesperson Reverend Wesley Fiore denied 
last 
Monday the claim by former CNL chair Fr. Felipe Patricio that a 
"Sison faction" has drawn the CNL into the internal rift of the 
Communist Party. 
  In a press statement to the INQUIRER, Fiore said Patricio 
can 
no longer speak for the organization since he was expelled from 
the organization by the CNL's national council last 20 April. 
  Fiore said Patricio was expelled for "conduct unbecoming of 
a 
CNL chairperson and a comrade" after he was accused of contempt 
for the CNL constitution and inciting the membership for 
rebellion against the national leadership of the organization. 
  "It was unfortunate that Father Patricio was too eager to 
`meet the press' to create the illusion that the CNL is for the 
estranged `NDF democratic bloc' of which, it turned out, he has 
long been a secret member," Fiore said. 
  "The CNL respects the private persuasion of Fr. Patricio but 
denounces his attempts before media to deliver the organization 
to a political faction, well intentioned perhaps, but alien to 
the CNL's principles," Fiore said. 
  The NDF, the umbrella organization of underground leftist 
organizations, has also been rocked with debates on political 
line and revolutionary strategy and tactics which has earlier 
resulted to a split between "reaffirmists" and "rejectionists" 
in the CPP.

expelled from the underground movement for their refusal to 
recognize Jose Maria Sison as the chair of the Communist Party 
of the Philippines (CPP), reports reaching Camp Aguinaldo said 
yesterday. 
  Col. Angelo Reyes, commanding officer of the Civil Relations 
Service (CRS) of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said the 
CPP "faces more serious crises" due to the worsening rift within 
the movement." Reyes identified those expelled as Timoteo Pupa, 
Central Mindanao Regional Committee (CMRC) secretary and Ike de 
los Reyes, Pupa's deputy.

  [Text] Clark -- President Ramos yesterday issued a 
directive designation the former American military base in 
Pampanga as the future site of the country's premier 
international airport. [sentence as published] 
  But the actual development of Clark Air Base, the former 
headquarters of the U.S. 13th Air Force, into a commercial 
aviation complex will have to wait until 1998 when the effects 
of Mount Pinatubo have completely been swept away. 
  The president said the executive order creating a special 
economic zone in Clark came after he approved a masterplan 
prepared by a Japanese group for the development of a civilian 
commercial aviation complex in the former American military base. 
  Apart form an airport, the aviation complex will have space 
for aircraft maintenance and service facilities, an aircraft 
assembly and parts manufacturing plant, and other 
aviation-related industries. 
  To make the airport accessible, the president also revealed 
plans for a construction of expressways linking Clark and Subic 
as well as Clark and Metro Manila. 
  The Philippine National Railways (PNR) is also 
rehabilitating 
its tracks to access Clark which will become the nucleus of a 
rail network linking Metro Manila with the northern Luzon areas 
particularly the planned Northern Luzon Quadrangle which is 
composed of Pangasinan, La Union, the two Ilocos provinces and 
Baguio City in Benguet. 
  The president said the development of Clark as a aviation 
complex will help ease congestion at the Ninoy Aquino 
International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yi Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and </F>
minister of the National Unification Board, by Yi Yong-il, 
senior KBS-1 reporter, at the KBS-1 Television studio in Seoul 
on the "Focus of News" program; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter Yi Yong-il] How are you? As soon as you, 
deputy prime minister, came to office, the North Korean side put 
forward a new card. As you learned from a news report yesterday, 
North Korea abruptly informed our side on 28 April that it will 
unilaterally withdraw from the Military Armistice Commission 
[MAC] at a time in which the North Korean nuclear problem has 
not been resolved. 
  What do you think is North Korea's true intention? 
  [Minister Yi Hong-ku] The North Korean side wanted to shift 
the Armistice Agreement system into a peace agreement system in 
the past and North Korea took a position of doing this through 
negotiations with the United States. 
  However, the North Korean side's declaration of withdrawal 
from the MAC, which implements the Armistice Agreement, is, 
first of all, an extremely irresponsible act. This goes counter 
to the Armistice Agreement itself. The agreement stipulates that 
one side should not withdraw from it unilaterally. 
  Secondly, Article 5 of the North-South agreement also 
stipulates that when one side wants to change this system, one 
should go through consultations and reach an agreement between 
the North and the South. Thus, the North Korean act goes counter 
to this spirit. Moreover, the MAC has the responsibility for 
managing an unexpected situation, or any accident which may take 
place in areas near the tension-filled armistice line. 
Therefore, removing such a management system is unjust. 
  The nuclear problem has entered into a very important stage. 
At this very important time, North Korea put forward a new issue 
which evades the focal point of the nuclear problem. This is not 
desirable at all. Therefore, I hope that the North Korean side 
will rectify this. 
  [Reorter Yi] My understanding of what you are saying is that 
the North Korean demand for replacing the Armistice Agreement 
with a peace agreement between North Korea and the United States 
is an offensive act that is linked with a political aim. Do you 
think that a peace agreement as North Korea demands is possible? 
  [Minister Yi] This agreement would be possible only when the 
prospect is clearly seen for the resolution of the present 
impending questions. Among these questions, the nuclear problem 
is the most important. Next, the basic North-South agreement, as 
I mentioned earlier, stipulates in its Article 5 that issues 
related to the Armistice Agreement should be resolved through 
inter-Korean concurrence. Thus, the peace agreement can only be 
discussed as part of the peace structure after we go through all 
of these procedures. The act of abruptly putting forward this 
issue at a time when the nuclear issue came to an important 
turning point will only cause confusion. This being the case, 
our position is that we absolutely cannot accept the North 
Korean assertion. 
  [Reporter Yi] Our government and international community 
made 
great efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem ever 
since North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation 
Treaty [NPT]. However, there has been no remarkable progress. 
Besides, the issues pertaining to the witnessing of the 
replacement of the fuel rods at the five-megawatt atomic reactor 
and to the additional nuclear inspection have not been resolved. 
What is your view on the nuclear problem? 
  [Minister Yi] The nuclear problem, particularly the issue of 
fuel rods, are presently at a very important turning point. 
Various messages have been exchanged between the United States 
and North Korea, and all international communities, including 
the International Atomic Energy Agency, direct great attention 
to this issue. What is particularly noteworthy is that the 
world's public opinion toward the North Korean nuclear problem 
is unanimous and reached an agreement, urging North Korea to 
respect and follow the opinion of the international community. 
This opinion will be enhanced as the day passes by. As a result, 
the North Korean choice may become even more difficult.

    [Text] [Minister Yi continues] Although the focal point is 
the nuclear problem, an even more important issue for North 
Korea is whether it makes an appropriate decision that 
corresponds to the trend of the international community and of 
international history. 
  [Reporter Yi] Reports noted that there are two different 
lines--hardline and moderate--in the United States, our ally, 
toward the North Korean nuclear problem. On the other hand, the 
people put forward the line of stick and carrot. I understand 
that our government is maintaining a position that it will not 
push ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea unless the 
North Korean nuclear problem is solved. Do you intend to 
maintain this policy in the future, too? 
  [Minister Yi] Yes. The nuclear issue, unlike other ordinary 
issues, is one which decides the destiny of the nation. This 
issue, regardless of whether one has one, two, or five nuclear 
weapons, is indeed fearful. Therefore, one should not evade the 
main point of the issue. We have a number of plans for economic 
cooperation to be carried out when a significant progress is 
seen. In addition, we also have a plan to form not only the 
economic common body but also a national commonwealth through 
economic cooperation. However, these plans can begin when a 
significant progress is seen in resolving the nuclear problem. 
Our situation is, in a sense, that we are waiting while making 
preparations. I believe that this is well understood by the 
North Korean side. 
  [Reporter Yi] We declared that we will not push ahead with 
the exchange of North-South special envoys, which was put 
forward as a precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korea 
talks. I understand, however, that this does not mean that we 
exclude North- South dialogue. What is your view on the prospect 
for North-South dialogue? 
  [Minister Yi] This is similar to the case of economic 
cooperation. In other words, this is up to the North Korean 
decision. The Korean peninsula should not remain as an exception 
to the trend of international history. This is what we and our 
neighboring countries wish. It is a principle that problems 
should be resolved by the parties concerned. We have a framework 
called the basic North-South agreement. We also have a framework 
called the joint denuclearization declaration for the nuclear 
problem. Based on this, various joint committees were formed. We 
should begin dialogue through these channels. All this will work 
as an excellent occasion for North Korea to resolve national 
issues and to evade its isolation. 
  We hope that North Korea, keenly aware of this situation, 
will make a good decision. We also urge North Korea to do so. 
  [Reporter Yi] The people pointed out that the unification 
policy by the diplomacy-security team of the government was 
confusing and inconsistent in the past. Thus, there were 
problems in its team work. People also pointed out that the 
Unification Board failed to play its role and functions 
properly. What is your view on this? 
  [Minister Yi] I do not think that there was serious 
confusion. As you know, each government office has its own 
characteristic in deciding important works assigned to it. The 
Defense Ministry is devoted to defending the nation and the 
Agency for National Security Planning places priority to 
security of our system and nation. The Foreign Ministry thinks 
of our international image and international cooperation. The 
Unification Board is the one that should push ahead with works 
pertaining to unification in a progressive way.

    [Text] [Minister Yi continues] What is important at present 
is to put various opinions and views together harmoniously. It 
is true that there were some complications in the past. However, 
each office came to have a good understanding of each other, and 
I believe that they will now handle the work in harmony. 
  [Reporter Yi] The family of Yo Man-chol, who defected from 
North Korea, held a news conference yesterday. At the news 
conference, we noted that North Korea is suffering from a 
serious food shortage. What plans do you have to bring in our 
country the North Korean workers who escaped from logging sites 
in Russia and our North Korean compatriots who defected to China? 
  [Minister Yi] Needless to say, our Foreign Ministry and 
other offices are making great efforts on this. The relevant 
government offices held many discussions to work out proper 
measures to deal with the issue. I understand that there is 
progress. Our government assumed it as an essential principle to 
resolve this issue from the humanitarian point of view, because 
there are many complex and delicate diplomatic, legal, and 
political factors. Taking all these factors into consideration, 
the government is handling the issue in an appropriate manner. 
We seek the people's cooperation and understanding so that the 
government can settle this quietly. What I mean by humanitarian 
point of view is the welfare of the constituents of the nation 
who shared the same blood with us. Thus, the government, paying 
keen attention, will deal with the issue properly. 
  [Reporter Yi] Many people think that the continuous escape 
of 
the North Korean compatriots may lead to the collapse of the 
North Korean system. In other words, a similar situation to what 
happened in East Germany will occur. However, the North Korean 
side is known to be opposed to reunification through absorption. 
What is your opinion on this? 
  [Minister Yi] As it is known, our basic policy is to 
establish a national commonwealth [minjok kongdongche] on this 
land in a peaceful, independent, and democratic way. 
  Therefore, we neither want to see an abrupt outbreak of a 
situation nor do we wish misfortunes resulting from such 
situation. The whole world is changing today. But only the 
Korean peninsula remains divided. This is indeed a disgrace of 
the nation. North Korea should respond to dialogue at an early 
date. We need not be nervous about the North Korean claims on 
opposition to reunification through absorption and so forth. 
  It is true that many North Korean compatriots are suffering 
from many difficulties. However, we have no intention to use 
this for political purposes or for North-South relations. 
  [Reporter Yi] People are hoping that the relevant government 
officials in charge of diplomatic and security affairs should 
make efforts to seek national consensus and to make the people 
fully understand the situation. What is your view on this? 
  [Minister Yi] I will speak to the people as much as I can 
whenever the opportunities arise, just as now. There are many 
channels for dialogue. I do intend to fully reflect the people's 
opinion and views in the policies to be implemented. I think 
that without dialogue with the people, no policy can be 
implemented effectively. In particular, this is ever more true 
about the reunification policy. Thus, I will make all possible 
efforts to seek the people's wisdom and reflect their will in 
the policies. 
  [Reporter Yi] Thank you for being with us today despite your 
busy schedule. 
  [Minister Yi] Thank you.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton 
warned Wednesday of "much, much more severe" isolation if North 
Korea goes ahead with its nuclear development program. 
  "It doesn't fully make sense," Clinton said at a press 
conference with reporters from over 40 countries in Atlanta, 
Georgia. North Korea would have "more possibilities, more 
security and more prestige" if it honored its commitment to be 
non-nuclear. 
  Asked about U.S. alternatives in deterring North Korea, 
Clinton said the "options are clear but they aren't easy." 
  "No one wants this confrontation, but neither does one want 
to have a state not only with nuclear power but with the 
capability to proliferate nuclear weapons," the President said. 
"The options we have are largely in the hands of the North 
Koreans themselves." 
  The controversy over Pyongyang's secretive nuclear program 
flared up with its restrictions on free and complete 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. 
  At the end of the last inspection in March, the agency said 
it was unable to confirm whether North Korea had diverted 
nuclear material for non-peaceful purposes. 
  Clinton stated, "I would say to the North Koreans, 'the 
United States wishes to have a friendly and open relationship. 
We wish to have a constructive relationship and we want you to 
have a constructive relationship with South Korea. 
  "'You have pledged yourselves to a non-nuclear Korean 
peninsula. That's what we want,'" the President emphasized. 
  If Washington sought to isolate Pyongyang, it would only be 
because North Korea had not honored its promises to be a 
non-nuclear state and to accept IAEA inspections. 
  "North Korea agreed to be a non-nuclear state, to follow 
non- 
proliferation policies," he said. 
  Unless it fulfills these commitments, "North Korea will be 
much much more severely isolated," Clinton said.

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
articles and editorials published in Seoul vernacular newspapers 
on 4 May on North Korean moves to replace the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace treaty and to disband the Military 
Armistice Commission, MAC. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO publishes on page 5 an 
1,400-word article by An Hui-chang entitled: "Experts' View on 
North Korea's Recent Moves." 
  Describing North Korea's recent military moves -- including 
the approach of planes to the Military Demarcation Line -- as 
"unprecedented," the article notes that ROK experts on the North 
Korean issue generally agree that the moves are aimed at 
"weakening the system of the Armistice Agreement, while telling 
the United States that the issue of signing a peace treaty will 
be raised in the upcoming third round of high-level official 
talks." 
  Summing up various experts' opinions, the paper notes North 
Korea's military moves are "to clarify its present stance to the 
United States by intentionally creating a situation in which the 
Armistice Agreement itself is still maintained, while 
undertaking a series of military moves violating such an 
agreement," and "to make the U.S. military forces withdraw from 
the ROK." Noting the timing of North Korea's proposal on 
replacing the Armistice Agreement, the experts analyzed that 
such a proposal is apparently aimed at "distracting attention 
away from the nuclear issue facing North Korea," "sitting down 
with only U.S. officials while excluding the South Koreans," and 
"showing its peaceful face to the international community to 
recover its image which suffered from the remark on 'turning 
Seoul into a sea of fire'." The article concludes by calling on 
the ROK Government to map out "long-term measures" to counter 
North Korea's "strange actions." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO publishes on page 2 a 700-word 
article by Song Tae-kyu on the reaction of the ROK Defense 
Ministry and the UN Command, UNC, to North Korea's decision to 
withdraw from the MAC. The article notes that their first 
reaction was "indifferent" since this is not the first time 
North Korea demonstrated peculiar actions and North Korea has 
not officially informed the MAC of its decision. 
  The paper reports that the Defense Ministry and UNC accused 
North Korea of trying "to neutralize the MAC and divert the 
international community's attention away from their nuclear 
suspicion" and interprets this move as a "tactic to replace the 
existing Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty favorable to 
them and also to have talks on its nuclear and other issues with 
the United States only, excluding South Korea." Reporting on 
the North's pledge to maintain the telephone hotlines between 
the South and North military authorities, the paper analyzed 
this as the North's plot to gain a favorable position in the 
coming negotiations over its nuclear development. 
  The article concludes that the Defense Ministry and the UNC, 
charging the move as an apparent violation of the Armistice 
Agreement, have mapped out a plan to take appropriate measures 
against the North after consulting with the countries concerned. 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN publishes on page 3 a 800- 
editorial noting that such moves by North Korea shows its 
unwillingness to discuss any issue with the ROK delegates and 
that "such an unprecedented attitude of North Korea will all the 
more heighten tension on the Korean peninsula" and questions 
"the true intention of North Korea," which is "contradictory -- 
calling for great national unity, but only attempting to open 
dialogue with the United States, excluding South Korea." The 
editorial calls on the government to provide the people with 
precise and honest information about the current situation and 
cautions against exaggerating the situation for political 
purposes, as the past authoritarian regimes frequently did. 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO and KYONGHYANG SINMUN both publish 
on page 3 800-word editorials regarding North Korea's decision 
to withdraw from the MAC. The editorials note that the North 
Korean proposal is nothing but the reiteration of a 
long-standing demand to replace the Armistice Agreement with a 
peace treaty. The editorials, however, interpret that the 
motivation for the recent proposal is to achieve an equal 
footing with the United States and to eliminate the ROK's role 
in the Korean security setup. The editorials call on the ROK 
Government to beef up the ROK-U.S. cooperation system and assume 
a stern stance toward North Korea's possible provocative acts.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Kyo-kwan] </F>
  [Text] The Lucky-Goldstar and Samsung business groups are 
pushing for infrastructure development projects in North Korea, 
although the still unsolved nuclear issue is preventing them 
from directly investing in the Communist country. 
  The Lucky-Goldstar Business Group has in principle accepted 
an offer from the Pyongyang government to take over the 
management of Kim Chaek Steel Mill, the largest steel maker in 
the North, a high-ranking group official said on condition of 
anonymity. 
  "North Korea has put forward the proposal because it needs 
the money to resuscitate the steel mill whose operating ratio 
has been falling sharply," said the official in an exclusive 
interview with THE KOREA HERALD. 
  Kim Chaek Steel Mill now appears to be heading for a 
shutdown 
as the North Korean regime doesn't have enough U.S. dollars to 
import coke, a coal derivative needed to melt iron ore, from 
Russia, he said. 
  The steel mill's shutdown may have a disastrous effect on 
North Korea's already moribund economy. Apparently, to avoid 
such a scenario, North Korea contacted Lucky-Goldstar, the 
nation's third- largest business conglomerate. 
  Pyongyang secretly delivered the proposal to Lucky-Goldstar 
via its officials in China late last year. 
  "We have since then negotiated with Pyongyang officials, 
including a vice minister, on the matter in China. Recently, 
both sides have reached a tentative agreement in Beijing," he 
said, declining, however, to elaborate on the deal. 
  In late March this year, the conglomerate sent a delegation, 
including the unnamed Herald source and two other senior 
officials from Lucky-Goldstar International Corp., the group's 
trading arm, to Beijing to fine-tune contract terms with their 
North Korean counterparts. 
  "When realized, it will be an epoch-making bilateral 
economic 
cooperation project between the two Koreas," said the 
Lucky-Goldstar official who is now responsible for planning the 
group's investment projects in the North. 
  At present, inter-Korea cooperation is not active. A typical 
form of cooperation now is South Korean firms sending materials 
for such light goods as textiles and toys to their North Korean 
partner for processing. Firms in the South export the processed 
products abroad. 
  Pyongyang's unprecedented offer to Lucky-Goldstar led North 
Korea watchers to confirm that the Communist country's economy 
is nearing the verge of collapse. To revive it, they noted, the 
help of foreign countries, including South Korea, will be 
essential. 
  The fact that Kim Chaek Steel Mill may be closed soon was 
all 
the more shocking to the experts in Seoul because North Korea 
promoted Hong Sok-hyong to deputy premier in charge of the 
economy in 1993 in a recognition of his achievements as director 
of the steel mill, they noted. 
  "Our investment strategy toward North Korea focuses on heavy 
industry where we haven't yet advanced in the South," the Lucky- 
Goldstar official said. 
  Under a long-term strategy mapped out in 1993, 
Lucky-Goldstar 
aims to make a presence in the steel, auto and shipbuilding 
industries by acquiring or setting up plants in the North, he 
said. 
  "This is why we have in principle accepted the Pyongyang 
proposal although the investment risks are high," said the 
official, adding that such efforts will contribute to helping 
reunite the two Koreas in the long run. 
  In this regard, Lucky-Goldstar is also considering advancing 
into the auto industry by taking over the North Korean automaker 
Sungni Machinery, the official revealed. 
  "At present, the Pyongyang government regards Lucky-Goldstar 
as the most reliable partner among South Korean business 
groups," the official said, citing the group's consistent 
efforts to gain the confidence of Pyongyang officials. 
  Meanwhile, the Samsung Business Group has also decided to 
invest in developing a North Korean port on the eastern coast. 
According to a Samsung official, the group has recently 
accepted an offer from Pyongyang via an ethnic Korean 
entrepreneur in China. 
  "In addition, we are expected to sign an agreement with the 
Pyongyang government soon on establishing a joint venture for 
container production in the port city near the North Korean 
border with Russia," said the Samsung official on the condition 
of anonymity. 
  According to the two unnamed officials of Lucky-Goldstar and 
Samsung, their business groups have applied to the Unification 
Board for approval of their direct investment projects in North 
Korea. 
  Until 1992, North Korea had made overtures to Hyundai and 
Daewoo to attract capital in developing its outdated 
infrastructure. Both Hyundai and Daewoo are strong in heavy 
industries. 
  In particular, the Pyongyang government appeared to regard 
Hyundai as the best business partner in South Korea. It invited 
Chong Chu-yong, the Hyundai chairman, and during his visit, 
Chong promised to invest in heavy industrial fields. 
  The North Korean leadership, however, felt betrayed as the 
Hyundai group founder could not keep his investment promises, 
said Kim Yong-sin, an official of the Korea Trade Promotion 
Corp. (KOTRA). 
  Along with Hyundai, Daewoo also lost the confidence of the 
Pyongyang leadership. 
  According to the KOTRA official, North Korea has since 
focused on maintaining a close relationship with Lucky-Goldstar 
which it found to be more reliable and better managed. 
  As a result, Lucky-Goldstar has tried to build confidence by 
placing orders with North Korean firms to produce men's jackets 
and toys, the official said. 
  "At the meeting in Beijing, we also discussed with North 
Korean government officials the establishment of a joint venture 
to manufacture umbrellas in the Najin-Sonbong free trade zone in 
the estuary of the Tumen River," the Lucky-Goldstar official 
said. 
  Regarding the development of the free trade zone, the 
Chinese 
government has asked Lucky-Goldstar to take part in its project 
to build a road linking China with Chongjin, a northeast North 
Korean port city, he said.

  [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song's lump is 
growing as time goes by. It has been confirmed that President 
Kim Il-song's lump on the back of his neck is growing bigger and 
causes him discomfort. 
  CHUNGANG ILBO has exclusively obtained photographs taken by 
a 
Western figure, who recently visited North Korea, using his 
video recorder. Compared to a photograph that was made public 
in 1988 (black and white), these photographs show that his lump 
is growing bigger (top picture) and expanding toward his head 
(middle picture) and his lower neck (bottom picture). This lump 
is not fatal. President Kim Il-song has been undergoing 
acupuncture treatment since the seventies because surgery on 
this lump may hurt his brain.

  [Text] Two quarantine officials will face punishment for 
their alleged roles in allowing importers to market frozen 
U.S.-made frankfurters here despite their original labels 
instructing "keep refrigerated." 
  An inspection team at the Ministry of Health and Social 
Affairs detected illegal practices by 24 importers in March and 
the ministry ordered them to destroy frankfurters valued at 19 
billion won, although two-thirds had already been sold. 
  The officials are Chang Chun-sik, 48, who now works for the 
National Institute for Safety Research, and Chi Yong-ae, 37, at 
the Pusan National Quarantine Station (PNQS). 
  The ministry yesterday asked a disciplinary committee of the 
Government Administration Ministry to determine their 
punishment. Chang and Chi, who worked together for the PNQS in 
November 1990, permitted importers to extend expiration dates of 
refrigerated sausages from 30 days to 90 days as if they had 
been frozen.

  [Text] The American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Korea is 
under fire for describing Korea as a hell from which foreign 
investors should stay away. Government officials have also 
found factual errors in its latest report on the Korean 
financial market prepared by the chamber. 
  Ministry of Finance [MOF] officials say the "one-sided, 
distorted and unbalanced" report might mislead American policy- 
makers and politicians into misunderstanding that Korea is a 
closed market, not a liberalizing one. 
  An MOF official said, "The AmCham report appears to distort 
or overshadow Korea's latest efforts to reform the financial 
market. Thus we have prepared our own view on what AmCham 
members have highlighted." 
  The MOF, however, is refraining from providing AmCham with 
its comments on each subject, believing its comments, as was in 
the past, will not be reflected in the revised AmCham paper. 
  The MOF was said to have sent a "protest letter" to AmCham 
President James Riddle and U.S. Embassy commercial attache John 
Hoog, sources said. 
  MOF officials said, "Depending on how you describe Korea or 
the United States, it becomes a "heaven or a hell." They added 
that one country, be it Korea or the United States, does not 
necessarily have only negative aspects." 
  In fact, AmCham never used the word hell in its report, but 
when you read the whole of it, you get the impression that Korea 
is a hell for foreign investors, government officials said. 
  They said AmCham has "made efforts to project a negative 
view 
of the Korean economy." The paper sometimes contains even 
"distorted and incorrect information about Korea's investment 
environment for Americans, they said. 
  "What we are most concerned about is that a distorted or 
incorrect description of Korea might mislead foreign investors 
interested in Korea," they said. 
  Whether reliable or not, the AmCham report has been used as 
a 
barometer by foreigners in evaluating the investment environment 
in Korea and a reference for formulating U.S. trade policy with 
Korea. 
  A U.S. government official said, "The position of American 
businessmen is not necessarily the same as that of the U.S. 
government." But in fact, many American officials were 
"embarrassed" when they casually quoted part of the AmCham 
report without confirmation in official or private meetings with 
Korean government officials. 
  If foreigners read AmCham's report without any background 
information, Korea might be wrongly described as a country that 
imposes the serious discrimination against non-Korean bankers 
and brokers, he said. 
  He and many MOF officials said AmCham's report is biased and 
might tarnish the otherwise smooth and cozy relationship Korea 
and the United States enjoy. 
  MOF officials said they were disappointed with the "double 
attitude" some AmCham members display in meetings, they "praised 
us for making efforts to liberalize the market but in written 
documents, they are hell-bent on describing Korea as a closed 
market," they noted. 
  They said the report never mentioned what Korea has 
deregulated over the past few years and only highlighted the 
dark aspects. 
  Furthermore, the report mentioned that Korea should 
"accelerate" its reform program. But the pace of the reform is 
a matter to be decided by the Korean government itself, they 
noted. 
  Many American bankers, brokers and insurers are here for 
less 
than three years and they want to maximize profits during their 
stay. Thus it is only natural for them to want to see much of 
the pre-announced deregulation implemented while they are in 
Korea, MOF officials said.

  [Text] Kwangju, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Some 400 college students 
staged a surprise anti-U.S. demonstration near the American 
Center in this southwestern city at 5:30 A.M. Wednesday, 
declaring that "We oppose the United States creating a war 
atmosphere." 
  The students, members of Namchongnyon, an activist 
organization comprising students from Chonnam National and 
Choson Universities as well as other schools in Kwangju and 
South Cholla Province, tried to storm into the American Center 
but were blocked by riot police firing tear-gas. 
  A clash between the police and students wielding paint 
bottles and rocks ensued, injuring some 10 policemen and 
students who were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment. 
  At 6:10, the students moved to the South Cholla police 
agency 
to demand the release of their arrested fellows, while throwing 
over 20 paint bottles at the agency building.

  [Text] The ROK Government has begun to make efforts in 
earnest to obtain votes to become a nonpermanent member of the 
UN Security Council. Toward this end, the government has sent 
or will send presidential envoys to Africa, the Middle East, and 
Central and South America. 
  The government has sent No Yong-chan, Foreign Ministry 
ambassador-at-large, to a UN African Economic Committee meeting 
scheduled from 2 to 5 May. In the capacity of a ROK 
presidential envoy, he will deliver a keynote speech and call on 
participants to support the ROK's bid to become a nonpermanent 
member of the UN Security Council. 
  Ambassador No will later visit Nigeria and Zaire, major 
players in Africa. 
  The government will also send a presidential envoy to a UN 
Asian Economic and Social Committee meeting that will open on 27 
May in Jordan. He will carry out activities to gain support for 
ROK's bid for a UN Security Council seat from Middle East 
countries. 
  The government will also send Vice Foreign Minister Hong 
Sun-yong and First Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin to 
Central and South America to visit five to six countries to 
attract votes. 
  A government official concerned said: "A country should get 
two- thirds of votes at the UN General Assembly to become a 
nonpermanent member of the UN Security Council." He added: "We 
must try to win votes from countries in Africa, the Middle East, 
and Central and South America, where there are many UN members." 
  In the meantime, the government officially notified the UN 
Secretariat last February that it would run for a UN Security 
Council seat for the 1996-97 period.

  [Text] The Korean Trade Commission decided yesterday to 
launch investigations into the alleged dumping here of imported 
caustic soda products from the United States, China, Belgium and 
France. 
  Korea Soda Industry Association, a local manufacturers' 
group, filed a complaint with the trade watchdog April 6, 
alleging the imported sodium hydroxide, a basic chemical used to 
make soap, rayon and paper, was undercutting locally-produced 
goods, and damaging the domestic industry. 
  As to why the commission decided to launch the industrial 
probe, an official said that the complaint represented all local 
producers; the documents it submitted contained facts on dumping 
and industrial injuries; the commission could acknowledge some 
of the dumping margins and industrial injuries; and Korea 
Customs Administration and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and 
Energy are also recognizing the need for investigations.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Yang Chong-mo, former 
chairman of the Kukje-ICC Corp., has lost his legal bid to 
overturn the sale in 1985 of 1.19 million stocks of Kukje Corp. 
-- a subsidiary of Kukje-ICC -- to Hanil Systhetic Fiber Inc. Co. 
  A civil panel of the Seoul High Court ruled Wednesday that 
Yang was not totally deprived of the right to express his will 
when he contracted to sell the stocks to Hanil, meaning the 
contract is valid. 
  The face value of the 1.19 million Kukje Corp. stocks is 
5.99 billion won (about 7.42 million U.S. dollars). 
  The court decided that if a certain legal action is to be 
canceled or rendered invalid because it was committed under 
duress, such duress should be so strong that, as in Yang's case, 
the right to express one's free will should have been deprived 
totally. 
  "But after examining the detailed process of handing the 
stocks over to Hanil, the court cannot judge that Yang's freedom 
to express his will was deprived perfectly. The contract is 
therefore valid," the decision read. 
  Although the Constitutional Court ruled last July that the 
dismantling of the Kukje Group was unconstitutional because it 
came about due to unjust exercise of government power, the 
contract cannot be considered as being necessarily related to 
any abuse of government authority, the court said. 
  "So the contract itself is not a legal action of an 
anti-social nature." 
  Yang brought the lawsuit in April 1988, accusing senior 
government officials including then-Finance Minister Kim 
Man-chae of coercing him to sell all stocks in the Kukje Group's 
trade and footwear areas. Yang said the officials told him this 
was the wish of a high-ranking official in the Chon Tu-hwan 
government. 
  Yang lost the first trial as the court ruled that he had not 
been under such duress as to be perfectly deprived of the 
freedom to express his will, prompting him to appeal to the high 
court.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The seventh Sochongnyon or 
the Federation of Seoul Area College Student Associations was 
inaugurated in a rally held at Hongik University in western 
Seoul Wednesday afternoon. 
  About 2,000 activist students from Seoul National University 
and 39 other universities and colleges in the Seoul area 
attended the rally. 
  A student manifesto read at the rally claimed that "the 
government has one-sidedly yielded to market-opening pressures 
from world capitalist countries, causing threat to the very 
survival of workers let alone 10 million farmers." 
  It also asserted that "the United States continues to pose a 
nuclear war threat to North Korea to build up the danger of war 
on the whole area of the Korean peninsula." 
  Yi Chong-uk, a Hanyang University senior, was chosen as new 
Sochongnyon chairman at the rally which also set "resistance to 
rice market opening" and "anti-U.S. struggles" as Sochongnyon's 
major tasks of the year. 
  Prior to the rally, participating students staged a 
demonstration along a 2-km street from the Sinchon intersection 
to the Hongik campus, shouting "no war on the Korean peninsula" 
and "no market opening." 
  Large police forces were mobilized in the Sinchon area but 
no 
clashes were reported during the demonstration.

<F P=106> [Report by Hwang To-hyong] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Independent lawmaker Chong 
Tong-ho, former chief presidential bodyguard under the Choe 
Kyu-ha government, will be summoned Tuesday for questioning on 
his alleged involvement in the "Dec. 12 coup d'etat-like 
incident," the prosecution said Monday. 
  The incident refers to the controversial apprehension of 
then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. Chong Sung-hwa by a group of 
military officers seeking to interrogate him in connection with 
the assassination of former president Pak Chong-hui in 1979. 
  Chong Sung-hwa and his followers have filed suits with the 
prosecution against former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was then 
chief of the Defense Security Command (DSC) in charge of 
investigating Pak's assassination case, and Chon's men, accusing 
them of staging a rebellion to grab power after former president 
Pak's assassination. 
  Lawmaker Chong, one of Chon Tu-hwan's men who was the acting 
chief presidential bodyguard, will be questioned on his role in 
isolating president Choe by replacing guards at the prime 
minister's residence with presidential security guards under his 
control, the prosecution said. At the time Choe still resided 
at the prime minister's residence, although he had assumed the 
presidency just after president Pak's death. 
  The prosecution has thus far interrogated 15 of the 38 
people 
accused of rebellion by former Army Chief of Staff Chong and 
other victims of the Dec. 12 incident. 
  Those already questioned include Ho Sam-su, who was then the 
DSC's personnel affairs bureau chief, Song Hwan-ok, then Army 
colonel at the military police unit of the Army headquarters, 
Pak Hui-mo, commander of the 30th division, and Pak Chong-kyu, a 
battalion commander of the third airborne brigade who actually 
mobilized troops to seize Chong Pyong-chu, then commander of the 
special warfare forces, in a bloody battle with Chong's forces 
who strongly resisted the apprehension of the Army chief of 
staff. 
  The prosecution's probe of the case has entered a second 
phase with former chief presidential bodyguard Chong Tong-ho 
being the first high-level official to be questioned in 
connection with the incident. 
  The prosecution said it would call in more than 10 
high-level 
officials and military officers involved in the case during May. 
  Among those to be summoned are Ko Myong-sung, who was then a 
senior presidential security guard, Ho Hwa-pyong, then chief 
secretary to DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan, and Yi Hak-pong, then 
senior official of the DSC's investigation department. 
  Also to be called in by the prosecution will be the 
then-commanders of the first and third airborne brigades, Pak 
Hui-to and Choe Se-chang, who mobilized their airborne troops to 
counter Chang Tae-wan, then commander of the capital garrison 
command, who fought against the forces of the DSC's Chon Tu-hwan 
to keep Chon from seizing then-Army Chief of Staff Chong 
Sung-hwa. 
  The prosecution also plans to decide by June whether to 
interrogate three former presidents involved in the incident 
including Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, according to 
prosecution sources. The prosecution said it will focus on 
whether the apprehension of Chong Sung-hwa constituted a 
rebellion under the military criminal code. 
  Chong and other victims of the Dec. 12 incident claim that 
then-DSC Chief Chon Tu-hwan and his followers violated the 
military criminal code by seizing Chong in an apparent effort to 
grab power in the vacuum created by Pak Chong-hui's death. 
Chon's side, meanwhile, insists that the apprehension took 
place in due course of investigating the incident and that they 
had no intention of taking power by seizing Chong.

  [Text] Seoul, May 3 (YONHAP) -- Senior government and 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) officials are far from 
impressed by Chong Chu-yong's announced intention to stay away 
from management of the Hyundai Business Group, it was learned 
Tuesday. 
  Chong announced his retirement from his group's management 
Tuesday morning at a press conference held shortly before his 
departure to Japan. 
  But since he said he would stay on as Hyundai's honorary 
chairman and provide advice to the group if necessary, officials 
at Chongwadae [presidential office], the presidential mansion, 
and the DLP do not think Chong will actually withdraw from the 
group's management. 
  A Chongwadae official, citing these reasons, called Chong's 
press conference "of no avail." 
  In spite of Chong's proclaimed retirement, the strained 
relations between the government and Hyundai caused by his quest 
for the presidency and his allegedly illegal means of financing 
his election campaign are expected to continue, according to the 
officials. 
  Since the presidential election in December 1992, Hyundai 
has 
received no financial support for facility investment from the 
Korea Development Bank and has not been allowed to open 
subsidiaries or to register in the over-the-counter market.

<F P=106> [Report by Cho Se-hyon] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The public's attention has 
shifted to Chongwadae [presidential office] after Chong 
Chu-yong, who is being tried on charges of violating the 
election law, declared Tuesday that he would keep his hands off 
the Hyundai business group's management. 
  Like it or not, the ball is now in Chongwadae's court and 
political and business leaders, as well as ordinary citizens, 
are waiting to see how the office of President Kim Yong-sam 
treats the beleaguered honorary chairman of one of the nation's 
largest conglomerates. 
  It is true that the judicial branch of government will have 
to handle Chong's case in court while the economic ministries 
must decide whether to ease various restrictions imposed on 
Hyundai companies. 
  But it is almost common knowledge that their actions depend 
largely on how Chongwadae receives Chong's retirement 
declaration, seen by many as a desperate plea for presidential 
leniency. 
  The initial reaction from Chongwadae was said to be cool. 
  "It is none of Chongwadae's business," one official was 
quoted as saying. "Chongwadae is not interested in what becomes 
of the chairman or honorary chairman of one particular business 
group." 
  Another senior presidential aide went so far as to ask 
reporters to describe Chongwadae's reaction to Chong's statement 
as "cold." 
  Chong managed to earn the wrath of President Kim when he ran 
in the Dec. 18, 1992, presidential election and "muddied" the 
campaign climate by "abusing" his group's money and manpower. 
  In the eyes of then-presidential candidate Kim Yong-sam, 
Chong may have personified the evil force in society which holds 
that "money can buy all." 
  Even after Kim was elected president, he reportedly vowed to 
"straighten out the bad habit with which (he) tried to buy power 
with money." 
  The cool response from Chongwadae is understandable since 
the 
presidential office has gone on record as saying that in Chong's 
case, it would simply follow "the principle of law." 
  Behind the stony facade, however, Chongwadae appears to have 
received Chong's declaration somewhat "positively," although 
suspicions about his true intentions linger as he did not say he 
would give up his honorary chairmanship of the Hyundai group. 
  Chong is likely to gain from his move only when he proves 
through deeds, not words, that he indeed intends to drop 
business and retire to his farm in Sosan, South Chungchong 
Province, to concentrate on farming. 
  "We have never discriminated against the Hyundai group," 
said 
one Chongwadae official, brushing aside complaints by many 
Hyundai executives. 
  "The problems of the Hyundai group, if any, are one thing 
and 
those of Chong Chu-yong are another," he added. 
  In other words, the government is expected to take phased 
action in starting to treat the Hyundai group the same as other 
business conglomerates -- that is, if Chong really does leave 
behind the world of business. 
  As for the legal case against Chong, there appears to be no 
change: Chongwadae will let it take its full course. 
  The feeling is that Chong's actions must be handled in 
accordance with the law, if only to show the public that before 
the law, everyone is equal. 
  In view of Chong's advanced age, however, many Chongwadae 
officials appear to believe that he is likely to receive a 
suspended sentence even if he is convicted.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Farm market brokers 
continued to strike against the new law on farm produce 
distribution and price stabilization for the second straight day 
Wednesday, paralyzing major agricultural markets across the 
country. 
  The new law prevents them from engaging in retail and 
wholesale business, among other things, causing an outpouring of 
anger. 
  In a meeting held Wednesday, the brokers resolved to 
continue 
their "work-to-rule struggle" until the government amends the 
law. 
  The government, meanwhile, flatly rejected their demand 
Wednesday by deciding not to revise the law. A senior 
presidential aide said, "there is no such thing as the principle 
of the law, which has been pushed for in the perspective of 
reform, to be retracted or re- amended. The brokers' act can by 
no means be accepted from the viewpoint of either the producers 
or consumers." 
  He said, "the government should, on the contrary, see to it 
that this incident be used as an opportunity for a structural 
reform of distribution of farm and fishery products to be 
facilitated." 
  Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok instructed 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Choe In-ki to 
relieve the farm market paralysis created by the brokers' strike. 
  Should the brokers continue to strike, the government will 
accuse them of "group egoism" and take punitive steps including 
investigation of their account books for heavy taxation, 
officials said.

  [Text] The prices of agro-fishery products, it is feared, 
may surge as middlemen at wholesale markets dealing with 
agro-fishery goods across the nation decided yesterday to 
abandon their wholesale business and stick to their own 
intermediary job. 
  A sudden stoppage of the middlemen's wholesale business may 
cause chaos in the distribution of agro-fishery goods and a 
sharp rise in their prices. 
  About 2,000 middlemen held a rally at the Karak-tong 
Agro-Fishery Wholesale Market in Seoul to agree to stage a 
lawful labor struggle until the government rewrites the recently 
revised act concerning the distribution and price stabilization 
of agro-fishery goods. 
  Under the newly revised act, which went into effect this 
past 
Sunday, the government has banned licensed middlemen at 
agro-fishery wholesale markets from carrying on the wholesale 
business. 
  Middlemen are only allowed to act as intermediaries between 
city- designated wholesale companies which collect agro-fishery 
goods from producers and retailers or wholesalers. 
  In the process, they receive a broker's commission on traded 
agro-fishery products. The current fee is 4 percent. 
  In the past, however, middlemen acted a wholesalers and 
earned huge profits in the process of relaying agro-fishery 
goods from wholesale companies to actual retailers or 
wholesalers by charging more than a 4 percent commission on 
transacted goods. 
  The middlemen's unlawful wholesale practice has played a 
major role in increasing the price of agro-fishery products. 
  The wholesale business, however, has accounted for about 80 
percent of the total transactions of goods at agro-fishery 
wholesale markets. 
  There are about 11,000 licensed middlemen across the nation, 
including 1,500 at the Karak-tong wholesale market along with 69 
city-registered wholesale companies which can collect 
agro-fishery goods from producers and list them on the wholesale 
markets for public auction. 
  Agro-fishery products brought into the Karak wholesale 
market 
amounted to 6,675 tons yesterday, down 1,072 tons from the 
previous day but the wholesale prices of agro-fishery goods 
increased an average of 5 percent. 
  To soothe the middlemen's growing protests of the revised 
act 
and a possible price surge of agro-fishery goods, the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries yesterday decided to 
designate the month of May as a guidance period for middlemen 
before the implementation of the revised act. 
  The ministry also said that it will assist in the 
establishment of retailers' cooperatives which can buy 
agro-fishery goods directly from the city-registered wholesale 
companies.

  [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- After 10 years of effort, 
Korean physicists are close to launching a world-class 
theoretical physics center together with their Asia-Pacific 
counterparts. 
  The national university alliance of basic science center 
headed by Kim Chae-wan, a physics professor at Seoul National 
University, hosted a two-day meeting of the preparatory 
committee for the Pacific theoretical physics center in Seoul 
Monday and agreed to set up a research base in Korea, Japan or 
China. 
  Six Korean representatives from the world of physics 
including Kim, who chairs the committee along with Tokyo 
University President Arima Akito, Melbourne University Dean B. 
Mckellar and physics scholars from China, Taiwan, Malaysia, 
Thailand and Vietnam attended the meeting. 
  Korea is said to be the leading candidate for the center, 
but 
as an international institute must have the approval and support 
of the participating countries, the center is expected to open 
no sooner than in two years' time. 
  The center will be the second international theoretical 
physics research body after a similar one in Italy.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Foreign media denounced 
the U.S. hostile policy of stifling the DPRK. 
  The Czech paper NASE PRAVDA No. 14 said U.S. propaganda 
media 
spread the rumor that North Korea was "developing" nuclear 
weapons, "threatening" South Korea, but it is contrary to fact. 
  The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the 
United States as it introduced many nuclear weapons into South 
Korea, the paper said, contending that if the nuclear issue is 
to be solved, the United States must withdraw nuclear weapons 
from South Korea. 
  The Iranian paper KAYHAN APRIL 5 said the U.S. acts of 
shipping into South Korea Patriot missiles and sophisticated 
military hardware and moving there its nuclear carriers and 
various kinds of warships show that it is weak, and they signify 
a victory of North Korea. It is the consistent position of 
North Korea to answer strength with strength, dialogue with 
dialogue, the paper said, and added: The United States cannot 
stifle North Korea. 
  The Swedish magazine RIKTPUNKT No. 6 said although the 
United 
States is claiming "observance" of the Nuclear Non-proliferation 
Treaty, pretending to be a "defender" of world conscience, it 
has virtually deployed nuclear weapons in many parts of the 
world and is constantly developing dangerous new weapons.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists conducted on 2 May, along with the puppets, a 
provocative aerial war exercise aimed at launching an aggression 
on the North by introducing fighter planes into South Korea from 
U.S. Pacific area bases. 
  Prior to this frantic war exercise, F-15 fighter-bombers, 
FA-18 pursuit-assault bombers, E-3 early warning planes, which 
had taken off from overseas bases, had been deployed for mobile 
operations in the bases of the U.S. occupation Air Force in 
South Korea. 
  This war exercise was frantically conducted in the air over 
Yongwol, Yangpyong, and Koesan areas under the command of E-3 
early warning planes--which are called aerial flight command 
post. Put into this exercise on a large scale were aircraft, 
which had flown into from overseas bases, and the 
fighter-bombers, assault planes, observation planes, 
reconnaissance planes belonging to the U.S. occupation Air Force 
in South Korea and to the puppet Air Force. 
  This gunpowder-reeking war exercise was aimed at studying 
the 
actual conditions of the command of E-3 early warning planes 
over the aircraft of various types and at increasing the 
capability of launching a surprise strike of aggression on the 
North for an actual war. 
  On the same day, the P-3 anti-submarine planes, which took 
off from a Japanese base, carried out espionage activities over 
the areas along the coast of the northern part of the Republic 
and the seas while moving around the east and the west for a 
long time. At the same time, they ran amok in an exercise of 
launching strikes against submarines with various mines, 
torpedoes, and depth charges. 
  In the meantime, the South Korean puppets ran wild in 
conducting helicopter operations and firing firearms exercises 
in the areas near the DMZ in front of our nose. 
  On 2 May, about 20 armed helicopters and transport 
helicopters, which went into action over the areas near the DMZ 
in the areas of Paju, Yonchon, and Chorwon, South Korea's 
Kangwon Province, ran wild in the exercises of launching missile 
strikes and ground support, and airborne operations in 
low-altitude and very low-altitude flights. 
  On the same day, the puppet Army tank group, which was 
deployed for mobile operations in the areas of (Kumsari), Paju 
County, fired about 30 rounds of tank gun fires at the bank of 
the Imjin River. The large-caliber artillery groups, which held 
firing positions in areas of Hapsuri and Majolli, Yonchon 
County; (Kupori), Paju County; and Naedaeri and Tongmangli, 
Chorwon County, Kangwon Province of South Korea, displayed their 
war frenzy by firing about 80 rounds of shots at areas near the 
DMZ of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  Also on the same day, the puppet Army armed rascals, who 
held 
combat positions in areas of Yulili and Naepori, Chorwon-up, 
Chorwon County in South Korea's Kangwon Province; Sinjongli, 
Inje County; and Songgongni, Yonchon County, Kyonggi Province, 
fired at random several hundred rounds of large-caliber machine 
gun fires while launching an attack in the direction of the MDL. 
  This reckless maneuver of playing with fire fully displayed 
the war-loving nature of the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets as warmongers.

there should be no effect from the United States keeping 
Thailand on its priority watch list for trade retaliation. He 
said the United States will not be able to take retaliatory 
trade measures now that international trade will be overseen by 
the World Trade Organization set up under the GATT agreement. 
Besides, in the announcement, the United States said it would 
like to see Thailand's copyright act passed by the Thai 
parliament first before removing Thailand from the list. Chulin 
said the copyright law is now being scrutinized by a special 
committee of the House of Representatives pending the second and 
third readings of the bill, which are expected to take place in 
May or June.

  [Text] Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said: 
Talks on diplomatic relations between Vietnam and the U.S. were 
held in Hanoi. The talks mainly dealt with continued 
negotiations between the two countries for the establishment of 
liaison diplomatic offices in each country. The two sides 
exchanged views on issues raised by the U.S. concerning each 
other's properties. 
  At this talks, the U.S. expressed its desire for further 
efforts from the Vietnamese side in searching for American 
servicemen missing in action. Regarding this issue, Vietnam 
affirmed that it has cooperated with the U.S. and will continue 
its efforts in the settlement of the MIA humanitarian issue. 
  Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam further said that the 
relations between Vietnam and the United States will developing. 
[sentence as heard] The process of normalization of relations 
between the two countries is under way and, sooner or later, 
Vietnam and the U.S. will set up diplomatic relations at 
ambassadorial level, because both sides will benefit from this. 
  Meanwhile, senior American leaders also made positive 
comment 
on relations with Vietnam. Last month, on his way to visit some 
Asian countries, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
declared for the first time in Hawaii that the Vietnam war will 
no longer an obstacle for Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to join 
the Asian-Pacific Economic Conference. [sentence as heard] 
Winston Lord, assistant U.S. secretary of state said: The U.S. 
wants to promote its relations with ASEAN as an enlarged 
organization including Vietnam as its member. It seemed that 
officials from both Vietnam and the U.S. share the same view on 
normalization of relations between the two countries. If this 
is true, relations between Vietnam and the United States will 
witness a turning point.

  [Text] South Korea's Kim Dae-chung, currently visiting 
Manila, believes a unified Korea will be beneficial not only for 
Koreans but for the people in the Asia-Pacific Region as well. 
  In yesterday's press conference at the Shangri-la Edsa Plaza 
Hotel, he discussed his recommendation to consider a 
"`negotiating package' to overcome the current nuclear stalemate 
and regain momentum for a gradual and controlled three-stage 
process for Korean unification." 
  He said the North Korean nuclear program threatens security 
and peace in the region, and suggested a base on which peaceful 
reunification of the Korean Peninsula can take place. 
  His "negotiating package" calls for the United States' 
recognition of North Korea "as a legitimate member of the world 
community" and for the establishment of diplomatic and economic 
relations between the two countries. 
  He also reiterated that the "Team Spirit" military exercise 
in South Korea needs to be suspended or better yet abolished. 
  On the other hand, North Korea should accept International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections, abandon its nuclear 
ambition, and stop any hostile policy against Seoul. 
  He also presented his proposed model of gradual 
reunification 
which needs to be achieved through three peaceful principles of 
coexistence. 
  Stage one is the "confederation of two independent 
governments, where each maintains authority in foreign affairs, 
national defense, and internal administration." Among its 
features is the equal number of representatives from each 
government to the Korean Republics and the consensus needed 
before any measure is passed. The confederation would aim to 
achieve the principles of peaceful coexistence, peaceful 
exchange, and peaceful reunification. 
  The second stage is the Korean federal system which is 
composed of two local governments given autonomy on internal 
matters but where foreign affairs and national defense are the 
responsibility of a federal government. 
  Stage three will be complete reunification which he believes 
may be more than a decade away.

  [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on 4 
May disclosed that North Korea has reaffirmed its stance of not 
allowing collection of samples when the fuel rods at North 
Korea's nuclear reactor in Yonbyon are replaced. 
  IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that the IAEA will not send 
for the time being its inspectors to North Korea since the 
latest response from the North Korean Government falls short of 
expectations.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- If North Korea continues to 
reject additional inspections of its nuclear sites, further 
action by the United Nations Security Council is inevitable, Yi 
Hong-ku, deputy prime minister and minister of the National 
Unification Board, said Wednesday. 
  Yi gave a briefing on the "recent North Korean situation and 
inter-Korean relations" at a meeting of the Advisory Council on 
Democratic and Peaceful Unification, saying that Pyongyang will 
eventually change its attitude because it has no good reason to 
delay settlement of the nuclear problem. 
  The newly appointed minister said, "Respecting the principle 
that the unification policy should maintain coherence, the 
government will adjust its direction according to changes in the 
situation as well as continue to study detailed ways to push 
ahead with this policy." 
  He said the Seoul government will deal separately with the 
nuclear and humanitarian issues. 
  "The government's decision to bring in North Koreans who 
escaped from the Siberian logging camps was made from a 
humanitarian point of view," Yi pointed out. 
  He clarified that the government will emphasize its 
unification policy in settling the North Korean dispute. 
  "Unless the deadlock on the nuclear issue is broken, the 
government will stick to its policy of linking the North Korean 
nuclear problem to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he said. 
  Seoul will continue to maintain the principles of 
inter-Korean relations -- settlement between the countries 
concerned, settlement between the governments, productive 
dialogue and implementation of agreements -- in pushing ahead 
with South-North dialogue, he added.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam on 
Wednesday warned that if North Korea persists in going nuclear 
and tries to test the West's patience, they would have no 
alternative but to face self-destruction. 
  Saying that North Korea is trying to develop nuclear arms 
with an aim not at Japan, China or Russia but at South Korea, 
Kim said, "Our patience has come to a limit. North Korean 
nuclear development should be thwarted by all means." 
  President Kim made the remarks at a tea party he hosted at 
Chongwadae [presidential offices] for about 500 steering and 
standing committee members of the Advisory Council for 
Democratic and Peaceful Unification. 
  "I hope North Korean authorities will realize that their 
acceptance of nuclear inspection and return to genuine dialogue 
for peace will be the only way for the survival of themselves 
and the Korean nation," Kim said. 
  He said he is willing to talk openheartedly with North 
Korean 
authorities on pending inter-Korean issues including the nuclear 
question if they unconditionally accept international inspection 
of their nuclear facilities. 
  The Chongwadae reception was also attended by Deputy Prime 
Minister and National Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku. Among 
the attending advisory council leaders were council Vice 
Chairman Kim Myong-yun and Council Secretary General Yu 
Kyong-hyon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Eijiro Hata, minister of the Ministry of </F>
International Trade and Industry, by unidentified YOMIURI 
SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to tackle the 
issue of resuming the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks? 
  [Hata] Since Prime Minister Hata was still in his post as 
foreign minister, he has tried to make contacts with the United 
States by taking advantage of various opportunities and making 
full use of his personal connections. From now on, it will be 
necessary for all the cabinet members to make use of all 
connections. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What will be the measures to deal with 
numerical targets that the United States has demanded? 
  [Hata] While insisting on the basic stand on never accepting 
this demand, we will continue to make efforts to seek consensus 
through positive talks. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you have any apprenhensions about the 
fact that the cabinet is now a minority-ruled administration? 
  [Hata] In actuality, there is no denying that the minority 
ruling coalition lacks strength. However, even opposition 
parties cannot ignore public opinion. Therefore, it is 
necessary for us to persist in promoting policies that can win 
public support. One of the major tasks lies in creating 
conditions so that the Social Democratic Party of Japan can be 
asked to rejoin the coalition. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] It has been pointed out that one 
characteristic of the Japanese economy is "dango [bid-rigging]." 
What do you think of it? 
  [Hata] I understand that the point at issue lies in the fact 
that some deviation is inevitable when an economic act that has 
long been practiced in Japan is viewed from the standpoint of 
foreign nations. In promoting economic reform or working out 
deregulation, we will have to make dynamic efforts to create a 
free and unfettered economic environment. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think of criticism against 
bureaucrats? 
  [Hata] To put it in another way, they may speak for Japanese 
bureaucrats' excellent capabilities because they possess not 
only professional knowledge but also strong administrative 
ability. In conducting political affairs, we must base our 
position on a broad standpoint sometimes and view things from an 
extensive viewpoint at other times. And what is important is 
that concerted actions are taken [by politicians and 
bureaucrats]. Nevertheless, it is essential for politicians to 
take up full responsibilities.

<F P=106> [Article by Koichi Hamade, professor of Yale University: </F>
"What Should Japan Do After Saying, `No'?"] 
  [Excerpts] Japan-U.S. Trade negotiation broke down 
with Prime Minister Hosokawa saying "No." The United States has 
now begun to make clear their policy to promote national 
interests, implying their plan to execute some "retaliatory 
measures." How can the two nations escape from playing a poker 
game? 
<H5>  Potential Problem of Voluntary Increase of Imports </H5>
  [passage omitted] While trade negotiation is a economic 
phenomenon, it is also a complex phenomenon in which politics 
and economics are entwined when we consider the fact that it is 
an international political negotiation, and that it concerns 
each participating country's domestic political balance. 
  First, let's look at the economic aspect. The United States 
has been asking that Japan should open up its market, 
specifically the product and the service markets, in order to 
solve Japan-U.S. trade imbalance which has reached $60 billion. 
Despite Japanese Government's repeated promises to open up its 
market, Japanese import of U.S. products had not increased. The 
United States demanded Japan to set an import target (or quota). 
This concerned mainly the automobile, auto parts, medical 
equipment, communications, and the insurance fields. 
  In regards to this request, Japan's position was that 
setting 
a quota would create a managed trade and did not agree with the 
principle of free trade. The Hosokawa dministration was working 
toward easing the governmental control, and they could not agree 
to setting an import quota which would necessitate reinforcement 
of governmental control. 
  Viewed in the light of trade theory, Japanese Government's 
argument is correct. In order for the principle of market to 
work effectively, it is necessary for buyers to be able to 
consider the quality, price, delivery, after-sale service, and 
choose the most advantageous products or services. It is totally 
against the principle of free trade, which promotes effective 
production using prices as a type of signal, to set a import 
target of how many percent of auto parts should be imported from 
the United States. 
  If regulations of the central or regional governments, or a 
collusion of industrial organizations or corporate groups are 
preventing Japanese consumers from purchasing economical and 
diverse consumer goods and services, or if corporations are 
kept from importing products that are advantageous for them, 
such regulations and collusion must be removed. The tariff and 
non-tariff barriers must be removed. However, voluntry export 
controls which limit the amount of export from Japan, and the 
voluntary import-boosting program which sets a quota on Japan's 
import, completely oppose the principle of free trade which 
helps worldwide distribution of resources by encouraging each 
country to make effort in providing products and services 
efficiently. 
  Furthermore, voluntary import-boosting program could create 
more problems than voluntary export controls. In the case of 
voluntary export controls, manufacturers put restraint on 
production by themselves. This is not desirable, considering the 
nation's distribution of resources; however, at least the 
production is done by efficient combination of production 
factors to produce a certain quantity. But, when there is a 
quota to fulfill in the quantity of imported parts to be used, 
they may have to use inferior parts also, thus the efficiency of 
production itself is hindered. 
  In addition, there is no principle found anywhere in the 
world trade which consists of many countries that equilibrium of 
the balance of trade between two countries should be maintained. 
It is not strange that a country, such as Japan, which has 
little natural resources, has a deficit in the trade with a 
country rich with national resources, such as Australia, and has 
a surplus in the trade with an advanced country, such as the 
United States. Lester Thoreaw, in the interview with THE NEW 
YORK TIMES said that he had a trade deficit with his barber and 
stationary stores. 
  It is based on such understanding on economics, that a group 
of U.S. economists, including Jagdish Bhagwati, Hugh Patrick, 
and Gary Saxonhouse, sent an autograph letter (the author of 
this article also signed it) to Japanese Government to warn them 
not to agree to the U.S. Government's request for voluntary 
import-boosting program easily, and that a group of Japanese 
economists (representative: Kazuo Ueda, professor of Tokyo 
University) also issued a similar statement. 
  The U.S. reaction was as follows: They understood Japan's 
position based on the principle of free trade. Under the 
Republican administration, the United States had demanded Japan 
remove tariff and non-tariff barriers. Notwithstanding that 
Japanese Government had promised cooperation in this matter, in 
reality, however, there were no visible results concerning 
opening of the market. As an intimidatory strategy, the United 
States has decided to demand Japan to set a quota--according to 
President Clinton, to make Japan agree to quantitative and 
qualitative standard (indicator or criterion). Since their 
regular tactics did not work, they are hoping that Japan's 
closed door may open with imposition of quota. 
<H5>  The Structure of "Double-Layer Game" </H5>
  The trade negotiation must also be looked at from 
politicoeconomic point of views. Trade negotiation is generally 
understood as an attempt by representatives from two countries 
to solve a conflict of interests between the two countries, each 
trying to make it more advantageous for his own country. 
However, it does not mean that the nations concerned have 
definite national interests. There are complex interests, such 
as the interests of export industry, the interests of import 
industry, and interests of consumers. For this reason, when we 
look at a trade negotiation as a game, the game between two 
governments are played on the ground of domestic games of 
conflict of interests. In this sense a trade negotiation has a 
structure of "double-layer game." 
  Naturally, domestic political situations put limits on how 
far the government can compromise with the other government. On 
the other hand, international negotiations can influence the 
domestic political balance in a subtle way. The recent breakdown 
of Japan-U.S. negotiation must be understood in the light of 
domestic political balance in the two countries. 
  As mentioned in the beginning of this article, although 
President Clinton has many problems both domestically and 
internationally, the U.S. economy has been recovering smoothly. 
However, the rate of economic recovery varies regionally, and 
recovery of California and New England is slow. Also in this 
recovery, the production and the consumption may be increasing, 
but unemployment rate is still high due to rationalization by 
reduction of labor force. President Clinton hoped to score 
points by succeeding in Japan-U.S. trade negotiation, but this 
did not happen. The opposition party, Republicans, did not 
opposed to Clinton's policy to demand Japan to open the market, 
though they did not agree to managed trade, Clinton's position 
would not have been any easier domestically even if the 
Japan-U.S. talks reached a compromise. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa is backed by a very shaky coalition 
government. In any country, the interests of manufacturers are 
more likely to become a political pressure than the interests of 
consumers. However, this tendency is especially strong in Japan. 
(Refer to the author's book From My Study Room at Yale 
University published from NTT Press in 1993.) The customs 
tariff is low; however, the Japanese manufacturers have been 
cordially protected in various ways, such as import restriction 
of agricultural products symbolized by the rice issue, 
overprotection on financial and securities, and insurance 
industries, the closedness of construction industry seen in the 
`dango' [bid-rigging by collusion], the recession cartel, and 
regulation of air, rail road, and bus fares. 
  There is International Finance Bureau in both the Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry has International Policy 
Bureau, and the Economic Planning Agency has Economic Welfare 
Bureau. These bureaus reflect both directly and indirectly the 
pressures from outside, as well as the consumers' position. 
However, the traditional Japanese Government has reflected the 
manufacturers' interests of certain industries more strongly, as 
indicated in the term "genkyoku" [principle bureaus]. The 
Hosokawa administration set out a policy to ease bureaucratic 
regulations and to reflect consumer interests. The 
administration has begun to take action favorable for consumers 
in handling the issue of importing rice, which had been a 
difficult political problem. 
  In addition to the conflict between consumers and 
manufacturers in Japan, the United States is watching the power 
relationship between Japanese politicians and the bureaucracy. 
Some (for example UCLA's Dr. Rosenberg say that politicians are 
more powerful in Japan also, citing the MOF's banking and 
securities agreement as an example. Others (for example Junko 
Kato of Tokyo University) say that the introduction of consumer 
tax, which was unpopular among the people as well as 
politicians, was possible because the bureaucrats were able to 
manipulate politicians, using their expert knowledge and skills. 
In this sense, the intricacies of the current economic policy 
are interesting. In collaboration with Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
income tax reduction policy, it was the MOF that suggested to 
raise the consumption tax to 7 percent in 1997. However, the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, the main party of the 
coalition, opposed to this plan and the tax raise did not come 
through. This gave the impression that politicians may have 
influence. However, upon discovering that the tax reduction is 
only for one year, I realized just how strong the bureaucrats' 
power is. 
  What we must pay attention is that voluntary export controls 
and voluntary import-boosting program have different domestic 
interests structures. First, let me explain the voluntary export 
controls. Politically, it is easier for exporting companies to 
approve voluntary export controls. Unlike being imposed a custom 
duty on by a foreign government or meeting a minimum import 
quota, the exporters can expect to monopolize profits by 
restricting production. Consumers abroad will suffer, but their 
voice is weak. The reason many countries often agree to 
voluntary export controls is that the incentive mechanism 
described above is at work. 
  On the other hand, in the case of voluntary import-boosting 
program, it is difficult to find a group that benefits from 
voluntary import-boosting program, no matter how strongly 
foreign exporters demand it. When imports increase, the price of 
imported products declines. This is beneficial for the Japanese 
consumers. However, the logic of imposing an import quota, that 
regardless of how effective or ineffective the products are, it 
will be beneficial for the consumers, is quite indirect. A 
simple and specific request for deregulation, such as "Remove 
the trade restrictions" is more effective in appealing to the 
consumers. Just as voluntary export controls, voluntary 
import-boosting program requires intervention of the supervisory 
office as well. However, they probably do not like to intervene, 
knowing that it will not be profitable for the industry, even 
though they are used to controlling and giving governmental 
guidance. One of the causes of the trade negotiation breakdown 
was that there were no incentives in voluntary import-boosting 
program as in voluntary export controls. 
<H5>  The Process Toward "Adult Relationship" </H5>
  People in the United States tend to exercise what they 
insisted regardless of the other party's situation. Now that the 
trade negotiation has ruptured, they will try to impose some 
kind of sanctions on Japan. We can see this in the custom duty 
on Japanese car phones. This action was taken as a measure 
responding to Motorola's appeal to restrict Japanese car phones 
export. In addition, there have been other sanctions reported, 
such as import restriction on several Japanese products by means 
of custom duty, and restriction on Japanese corporations' 
investment in the export bonded processing area. Furthermore, 
they have named dozens of Japanese corporations as their target 
of sanction. Upon returning to Japan, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
and those close to him clearly stated that if the United States 
should take sanction against Japan, Japan would retaliate, or 
appeal to GATT. 
  As U.S. newspapers report, the Clinton administration wants 
to open up Japanese market by strongly pressuring Japan. 
However, they are racking their brains as to how to avoid a 
trade war between the two countries and to keep both countries 
from falling into the undesirable protected trade situation 
("Prisoner's dilemma"--Refer to the Note). Prime Minister 
Hosokawa must share the feeling. 
  Note: "Prisoner's dilemma" means that if 
each of the two prisoners, who had been confined separately, 
cooperated and did not confess their crime, both of them will be 
cleared of the charge. However, if one confessed and the other 
did not, the one who confessed will be pardoned, and the one who 
did not will be convicted. This situation is a dilemma for both 
of the prisoners. Since they are both afraid that the other may 
confess, they both may end up confessing their crime. 
  The battle between Japan and the United States resembles a 
poker game. Both countries are trying to threaten each other 
with retaliatory measures in case of betrayal, waiting for the 
other to give up, each trying to reach a solution which is 
advantageous to its national interests. However, this game is in 
vain if trade negotiation come to a breakdown. For the United 
States, which dealt with international relationship as if 
playing a game, the recent trade negotiations have been like 
walking on a tight rope. It is also a very difficult situation 
for Japan, which has been like a brother to the United States 
and has been used to cooperating with the United States. 
  However, what is fortunate for both countries is that trade 
will continue, and the trade negotiation will also take place 
again. If it were a one time game, it will be highly possible 
that both countries to be in the "prisoner's dilemma" because 
their distrust in each other may make them betray each other. 
But since the game will continue, they may try to cooperate, 
fearing each others retaliatory measures in the future. These 
strategic reasons and the trust relationship between the leaders 
of the two nations bring a ray of hope in the future of 
Japan-U.S. economy. 
  As the prime minister himself has said, the last summit 
meeting can be understood as a process in which Japan-U.S. 
relationship is changing from the "big brother - little brother 
relationship" to "equal adults relationship." The United States 
was irritated that the obedient little brother would not do what 
he promised while saying "We understand" concerning the U.S. 
request to open up its market. Now Japan has begun to say, "We 
have grown up now. We would like to negotiate as equals. We 
cannot give away to the United States concerning the free trade 
principle." The United States told Japan to speak up clearly as 
they themselves do, but when Japan did just that, they did not 
like it. 
  The growing pain is necessary for Japanese economic 
diplomacy. When we see fast speaking Clinton in a press 
conference or watch a discussion between Mr. Buchanan and Mr. 
Saxonhouse, (ex-presidential candidates), on CNN (Cross Fire), 
we come to realize that Japanese politicians must improve their 
communications skill in order to share the world leadership. 
However, though he did not use many words, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa clearly declaraed his intention and that seemed to have 
given a favorable impression on people in the United States. He 
was especially persuasive when he said, "I am fighting with the 
bureaucratic restrictions in Japan. I cannot agree to the 
quantitative quota which would require industrial restrictions." 
President Clinton sounded rather defensive when he said, "The 
United States is not demanding a quantitative quota. We are 
merely requesting establishment of objective quantitative and 
qualitative criteria which can indicate the degree of openness 
of the market." 
  As the idea of Japan that can say "No" takes roots, a 
meaningful and clear communications style will be understood 
more and more. 
<H5>  Unpredictable Future Situations </H5>
  Changing the subject, let's discuss the balance between the 
exchange rate and the macroeconomics. 
  The news of collapse of Japan-U.S. trade negotiation created 
a stir in the world financial market, and stock prices in Japan 
fell sharply. Especially, the yen rate soared by as much as 4 
percent in a day. Because they failed to set a quantitative 
quota, high yen rate is the only way to diminish the trade 
imbalance. Therefore, the market reacted on the prediction that 
the U.S. Government will take measures to approve or promote a 
high exchange rate of the yen. When cheap dollar was expected, 
there was the fear that the number of purchasers of treasury 
bills will decrease. Thus the short-term interest rate also rose 
in the United States. 
  However, it is doubtful whether intervention in the exchange 
market by Japanese or the U.S. Governments will be able to 
control the yen rate. But, the reaction of the exchange market 
is understandable because now that Japan must expand its economy 
even more after the collapse of trade talks in order to reduce 
their trade surplus, and this will lead to higher interest rates 
and bring about the yen's higher exchange rate. 
  We should also pay attention that under the floating 
exchange 
rate system, the effect of financial and monetary policies is 
different from that of the fixed exchange rate system. Under the 
fixed exchange rate system, both an expansive monetary policy 
and an expansive financial policy would stimulate the domestic 
economy and reduce the surplus balance of current revenue and 
expenditure, (and where movement of the capital is allowed, a 
financial policy would work more effectively). On the contrary, 
under the floating exchange rate system, while an expansionary 
monetary policy may help expand the domestic economy, it may 
also increase the surplus because of the lowered interest rates 
and the cheap yen. 
  On the other hand, an expansionary financial policy may help 
reduce the surplus through higher interest rate and the yen's 
high exchange rate, but it may not help the economic recovery. 
Japan needs to expand its fiscal policy in order to reduce the 
surplus balance of current revenue and expenditure, and it needs 
easing of monetary and financial policies for economic recovery. 
  Incidentally, it was interesting to watch the progress of 
their tax reduction proposal in the light of macroeconomic 
effect. The income tax reduction would increase consumers' 
disposable income and is effective for stimulating the economy. 
However, if the consumtion tax raise is planned for three years 
later, the constant income, which indicates the consumers' 
average income toward the future, would not rise very much and 
the stimulant effect would not be very strong. 
  However, those who predict that prices will go up in three 
years may try to buy up durable consumer goods. If this bill had 
passed, it would have been an interesting experiment to see how 
well this type of stimulating effect might have worked. This 
bill turned out to be only a one-year tax reduction bill. The 
constant income will change little, and the stimulant effect on 
the economy will be very weak. 
  Acting as an adult means that there are some 
responsibilities 
to fulfill. Now that Japan has refused the quantitative quota, 
it must strongly declare that it will increase access to 
Japanese market from outside in some other ways. This should 
lead to the welfare of Japanese consumers. At present, it is 
unpredictable as to what kind of sanctions and retaliatory 
measures will be repeated between Japan and the United States. 
Will their action result in going against the world's free trade 
trend? There is no knowing whether the two adults will come to 
an agreement and escape the "prisoner's dilemma." 
<H5>  The Policy Japan Should Take </H5>
  Thinking about the matter calmly, it is hard to believe that 
there is an impossible gap to overcome between the interests of 
the two nations. 
  First, let's look at the industries at issue. Since Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's policy is to ease restrictions, he must 
theoretically be for reducing the interests of the government 
agencies, (Ministry of Health and Welfare, Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications, and Ministry of Finance), that oversee 
medical equipment, communications, insurance industries, and 
their supporting industries. Internationally insisting on free 
trade, Mr. Hosokawa must make serious efforts to remove the 
non-tariff barrier created by government restrictions. It is a 
good opportunity for him to take advantage of the collapse of 
the international negotiation, which is a semi-emergency 
situation, to overcome the domestic conflict of interests. 
  Second, since Japan has been troubled by a recession for a 
long time, its attempt to solve the imbalance of current revenue 
and expenditure will not create a zerosome situation for the two 
countries. This is because recovery of Japanese economy through 
macroeconomic policy will at the same time help reduce Japan's 
trade surplus with the United States. 
  As I mentioned earlier, financial expenditure and tax 
reduction are effective in reducing the surplus of the current 
revenue and expenditure balance. However, these would cause the 
yen's exchange rate to rise and might turn into be a recession 
creating pressure. An easy-money policy may help stimulate the 
economy but may cause the yen to become cheap and increase the 
surplus of current balance. A desirable "policy mix" of macro 
policy is to reduce tax--not just one year--and if this begins 
to cause a high interest rates and high yen rates, to ease 
monetary policy, (of course, if cheap yen situation should 
progress, or if the available employment competition rate 
exceeds one, Bank of Japan is responsible to enforce monetary 
restraint and avoid reviving the "bubble economy"). 
  Of course, the cause of the current account deficit of the 
United States is its financial deficit and the low savings rate 
of the public. Japanese Government needs to continue to point 
this out to the United States. Some say that the government 
deficit and the current account deficit have not been linked 
together in the past few years. Even if this was true, the 
deficit should be blamed on the low savings rate of the public, 
the tax system which should promote saving, and the economic 
policy. 
  It is a good news that Japan is growing to be able to say 
"No" in the international society. However, it is not easy to be 
responsible for what has been clearly said. This is evident in 
the fact that the United States is strongly demanding Japan to 
meet the "reasonable criteria" which Prime Minister Miyazawa 
vaguely agreed to. Japanese economic diplomacy needs to gain 
strength which is both firm and flexible--sometimes being angry 
and sometimes using humor to dodge the other's attack--so that 
avoid simply submitting to foreign countries' (traditionally the 
United States) will, and at the same time, avoid upsetting the 
other party and causing a breakdown of negotiation.

  [Text] Brussels, 27 Apr -- A diplomatic source disclosed 
on 27 April that the EC Commission has proposd that Japan create 
an arena where experts from Japan and the European Union (EU) 
can hold discussions on deregulation on a regular basis. 
  Earlier, the commission gave Japan a 31-point list 
requesting 
improvements in its regulation system, including liberalization 
of financial and other markets, investment stimulation, and 
import expansion. These matters were supposed to be discussed 
at the Japan-EU ministerial talks starting on 22 April, but the 
talks have been postponed due to the political chaos in Japan. 
  Japan included deregulation in a guideline for external 
economic reform adopted last month, and plans to work out 
concrete measures for it by the end of June. By securing a 
channel of dialogue on deregulation, the EU appears to want to 
"monitor" Japan in making certain that its deregulation program 
is put into practice.

  [Text] A MAINICHI SHIMBUN opinion poll shows nearly 70 
percent of the respondents want the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear arms program to be resolved by dialogue and 
not by sanctions. As regards Japan's participation in the UN 
Security Council as a permanent member, while 45 percent of the 
respondents said they "support" it, 43 percent said they "don't 
have an answer." This indicates that the public does not yet 
have a full understanding of the issue. 
  MAINICHI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide survey by 
interviewing 3,000 eligible voters on 22-24 April, with 76 
percent responding. 
  Regarding North Korea's nuclear arms development program, 26 
percent said they are "greatly concerned," and 43 percent said 
they are "somewhat concerned." Thus a total of 69 percent of 
the respondents were found to be concerned about the issue. On 
the other hand, the proportion of respondents who said they were 
"not much concerned" amounted to 20 percent, and those who said 
they are "not concerned at all" totaled 10 percent. 
  When asked about ways to resolve this issue, 71 percent 
said: 
"Concerned nations should continue dialogue with North Korea to 
persuade it to accept inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA)." This number substantially exceeded the 
13 percent of respondents who said: "Economic sanctions must be 
taken against North Korea." Only 4 percent said: "There is no 
need to ask North Korea to accept inspections." Broken down by 
the political parties supported by the respondents, 17 percent 
of the Liberal Democratic Party supporters and 16 percent of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] supporters replied "economic 
sanctions must be taken," while high rates of 85 percent of 
Japan New Party supporters and 82 percent of Sakigake 
[Harbinger] supporters replied "it should be resolved through 
dialogue." 
  Compared with when the last poll was conducted in September 
1993, the proportion of respondents who "supported" Japan's 
participation in the UN Security Council as a permanent member 
decreased by 2 points to 45 percent. The number of those who 
"opposed" it also decreased by 1 point to 10 percent. 
  However, the number of respondents who said they "don't have 
an answer" regarding Japan's participation totalled 43 percent, 
an increase of 5 points over the last poll. Among male 
respondents, 55 percent said they "supported" it, 11 percent 
said they "opposed" it, and 31 percent said they "don't have an 
answer." Of female respondents, 36 percent said they 
"supported" it, 9 percent "opposed" it, and 53 percent said they 
"don't have an answer."

<F P=106> [Discussion by Professor Toshiyuki Munekata of Teikyo </F>
University, Professor Tadashi Nishihara of the National Defense 
Academy, and Councilor Yoshiji Nogami of the Foreign Ministry's 
Foreign Policy Bureau; presided over by Takashi Kawauchi, chief 
of the MAINICHI SHIMBUN Foreign News Department; from the 
"Verification of North Korea's Suspected Nuclear Development" 
series; part two in a two-part series: "How Is Japan Going To 
Deal With Possible Military Confrontation?"] 
  [Text] [Kawauchi] The DPRK (North Korea) has stated that 
if economic sanctions are imposed against it, it will take that 
as a declaration of war. There is a danger that great ambiguity 
might lead to a military collision based on misunderstanding. 
  [Nogami] The suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development has continued since 1985 when the country joined the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). After its participation 
in the NPT, it took seven years for North Korea to accept 
inspections of its nuclear-related facilities by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). After the issue 
arose concerning its failure to report two nuclear-related 
facilities, the country played games, making good use of 
facilities which it already reported. North Korea has not 
suddenly gone to extremes, but instead is playing a 
long-sustained game. It is difficult for us to try not to lose 
our patience with the game. 
  However, because the operating of the second plutonium 
production line at the radio-chemistry laboratory (located in 
Yongbyon north of Pyongyang) is a problem, we have to think 
about the time limit.... 
  [Munekata] If those in the substructure who support the Kim 
Il-song and Kim Chong-il administration become a monolithic 
party, there is a possibility they will usurp power from Kim and 
his son. For this reason, the Kim administration has kept the 
substructures separate and has adopted a system which places 
them under mutual surveillance. Such people in the substructure 
brought about the Rangoon incident and the 1987 bombing of a 
South Korean airliner in a bid to please their "boss." We 
cannot say such an incident will not happen again. The current 
situation on the Korean peninsula is the most strained since 
1953 when the Korean war ended. 
  If something happens, Japan will fall into a panic, but will 
be unable to do anything. If a second Korean war breaks out, 
the loser will not be North or South Korea but Japan, for Tokyo 
will become a loser in the eyes of the international community 
since it did nothing. How will the international community view 
a country that is "unable to provide water and fuel" to the 
Australian Navy conducting warlike actions and patrols in the 
Sea of Japan? 
  [Nogami] We should seriously consider the pending issue of 
"acquisition and cross-servicing agreements" (ACSA) that provide 
logistical support to allied nations since the enforcement of 
ACSA is possible through administrative measures. I do not say 
this only for the sake of dealing with the situation on the 
Korean peninsula. It is unusual that although the security 
treaty has been concluded, Japan has not yet signed such an 
agreement. 
  Moreover, in view of domestic laws, how should we view the 
connection between the Road Traffic Act and transportation of 
the Self-Defense Forces [SDF]? Current laws ban the shipping 
and discharging of explosives and ammunition at night. Does 
this apply to emergency cases? There is no legal conformity. 
It is the same with the issue of using SDF airplanes to rescue 
overseas Japanese. The related bill was killed at the previous 
Diet session. 
  [Munekata] There is a possibility the Ground Self-Defense 
Force [GSDF] may be ordered to establish watch points along the 
coast in view of the possibility of refugees coming to Japan. 
However, it is not a security order nor a defense order. 
Places with a view of the coast are generally used as parks. 
Even if GSDF units try to enter a park for such activities, 
they cannot enter due to park regulations. It is out of the 
question. 
  [Kawauchi] Some believe North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development will lead to competition in development of nuclear 
weapons among northeast Asian nations. Moreover, an increasing 
number of people are doubtful of the efficiency of the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella in the post-Cold War era. 
  [Nishihara] It is inappropriate to deal with the PRC and 
DPRK nuclear issues in the same manner. The PRC is a 
superpower, and its nuclear program is relatively transparent. 
However, suspicion over North Korea's nuclear weapons 
development has triggered a U.S. concern that "Japan may also be 
armed with nuclear weapons." Although Japan has maintained it 
"will not become a nuclear power because it has the three 
nonnuclear principles [of not introducing, not producing, and 
not possessing nuclear weapons]," this is not persuasive. Japan 
needs to raise a clear argument that "nuclear armaments do not 
benefit its national interest." What Japan should say is that 
it may become a nuclear power if the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty 
is scrapped or Japan becomes isolated as a result of hostility 
with neighboring nations, but that in the current situation 
there is no possibility of it deciding to become a nuclear power. 
  [Nogami] During Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's visit to 
the United States in February, he said: "The option of 
possessing nuclear weapons would be against Japan's national 
interest." He added: "The possibility of Japan becoming a 
nuclear power is quite an insensible argument which ignores the 
sentiments of the Japanese people." I am sure the United States 
understood this view. So far we have been able to coexist with 
the nuclear weapons of the PRC and Russia because of the U.S. 
commitment to a nuclear deterrent. There are now arguments in 
the United States about whether it should abide by its security 
promise to the Far East. It can be said that the view of Japan 
becoming a nuclear power has been entangled in these arguments. 
  [Munekata] As Nishihara says, if Japan clearly states "it 
will arm itself with nuclear weapons under certain situations," 
then Japan will win the trust of foreign nations. Although 
Japan possesses a military strength of 270,000 soldiers, it does 
not call it a "military force." However, people in Southeast 
Asia do not trust this change in the wording. They are 
concerned Japan may maintain that "it does not possess nuclear 
bombs, only special bombs for self-defense." Japan's emotional 
nonnuclear policy is meaningless to such concerns. Without 
consistency in its logic, we cannot dispel foreign apprehension 
about Japan becoming a nuclear power. 
  [Nogami] However, I want to emphasize that Southeast Asia 
has deepened its understanding of Japan's "defense-only" 
principle. Security dialogues with those nations have been 
promoted. What is regrettable is that security dialogues with 
South Korea have not. Since Japan has just begun a dialogue with 
the PRC, its future task is to promote dialogue with South Korea. 
  [Kawauchi] I am concerned that, in the long run, Western 
nations will fail to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear 
weapons. They will not stop nuclear proliferation, but will try 
to prevent the use of nuclear weapons which have already been 
developed. What can we do? It has been stated in the United 
States that the preemptive use of conventional weapons is the 
only way to prevent the use of nuclear weapons. 
  [Nishihara] Certainly there are arguments that we have to 
deal with the nuclear installations of middle powers by using 
conventional weapons. 
  [Nogami] The prevention of North Korea's possession of 
nuclear weapons is not an issue that concerns only nuclear 
nonproliferation. In negotiations to normalize diplomatic 
relations, will Japan talk with a North Korea that possesses 
nuclear weapons? Or will Japan negotiate with a North Korea 
that gives up its possession of nuclear weapons? These are 
totally different. There is a possibility North Korea's economy 
will collapse while it possesses nuclear weapons. North Korea's 
major concern is the reconstruction of its economy. Their task 
is how to deal with foreign nations by using the nuclear card. 
  [Nishihara] While playing its nuclear card, North Korea will 
advance along the road of isolation, and its economy will 
collapse. On the other hand, while helping North Korea become 
isolated, Japan is trying to prevent the situation from 
developing into military action. While playing for time, both 
sides are waiting for the situation to turn to their advantage. 
  [Kawauchi] However, do you not think we will have to pay 
dearly for the sudden collapse of the North Korean structure? 
  [Nishihara] That will present a serious situation to South 
Korea. 
  [Nogami] North Korea wants to deal with its economy. In 
recent cases, senior government officials have been removed to 
take responsibility for their failure to deal with economic 
issues. 
  [Munekata] In North Korea, the people feel "all or nothing." 
There is a view that North Korea will choose between two 
courses: one is that the situation will develop into a second 
Korean war, and another is that North Korea will adopt a 
Chinese-style policy of opening up to foreign nations. 
  [Nogami] The North Korean people, who have been gradually 
obtaining external information, are feeling a sense of 
isolation, though no one says that. They think Russia and the 
PRC will be unreliable in their time of need. The PRC has 
maintained it has no influence on North Korea. 
  I think we need to seek a way of dispelling this sense of 
isolation by North Korea.

  [Text] On 3 May Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano granted 
MAINICHI SHIMBUN an interview. Touching on the Nanjing massacre 
in China caused by the former Japanese Army during the Pacific 
War, the minister said: "I think that certain reports, such as 
the one about the Nanjing massacre, are fabricated." That an 
incumbent cabinet member has openly denied the existence of the 
Nanjing massacre will not only arouse repulsion from the Chinese 
Government and others, but will become a controversial issue in 
Japan. 
  With regard to the Pacific War, Justice Minister Nagano 
stated: "It is wrong to call it a war of aggression. If you say 
that the war was launched for the purpose of aggression, that is 
incorrect. It was started while serious consideration was given 
to the idea of liberating colonies or liberating the 
co-prosperity sphere (in greater East Asia). Then, touching on 
the Nanjing massacre, he added: "I think it was fabricated." 
In explaining his reasoning why he said this, Minister Nagano 
stated: "Because I went to Nanjing immediately after the 
incident." 
  With regard to the Pacific War, (then) Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa clearly stated last August at the first news 
conference held after his inauguration: "It is my understanding 
that it was a war of aggression, and an unjust war." 
  The Nanjing massacre occurred in December 1937 when the 
former Japanese Army attacked and captured Nanjing, China's 
capital at that time, massacring a large number of Nanjing 
residents and prisoners of war. According to a Chinese 
announcement, "over 300,000 people" were killed. However, some 
have argued against this organized massacre. 
  Justice Minister Nagano was a graduate of the Military 
Academy of the former Japanese Army. During the Pacific War, he 
was sent to combat in China. After the war, he joined the 
Self-Defense Forces and once acted as Chief of Staff of the 
Ground Self-Defense Force. As a Diet member from the Liberal 
Democratic Party, he once remarked at a session of the party's 
Research Commission on the Constitution: "Some harbor an 
incorrect view about the history of the Greater East Asia War 
[Dai-toa senso]. Therefore, we should not adopt a one-sided 
position in discussing the war."

  [Text] The Japanese Government has begun studying a plan 
to provide full-fledged official development assistance (ODA) to 
the Republic of South Africa now that the first general election 
has been held in the country with people of all races 
participating. The government will begin concrete consultations 
following the inauguration of the new administration. 
  Because the South African Government used to practice a 
policy of apartheid, Japan's ODA has been limited to small 
amounts of aid provided in grants to private organizations which 
were engaged in activities in South Africa's black society. 
However, the new administration will be established following 
the general election in which people of all races participated. 
In response, the government has decided to positively promote 
ODA to South Africa. According to a senior Foreign Ministry 
official, the government has concluded that Japan "needs to 
highly evaluate the process for democratization in that country 
and support their efforts."

  [Text] Local autonomous governments are now in the process 
of reviewing their tender systems for public works projects 
following a series of financial scandals involving general 
contractors, chiefs of local autonomous governments, and 
politicians. ASAHI SHIMBUN has conducted a survey of 47 
prefectural governments and 12 municipal governments with a 
population of more than 500,000 each and the survey showed that 
almost all of the prefectural and municipal governments surveyed 
had experimented with an open competitive tender system with 
some conditions attached, and 20 prefectural and six municipal 
governments had already adopted, or had decided to adopt, the 
open competitive tender system. The survey found that many 
local autonomous governments had set prices for public works 
project at below the standard amount set by the central 
government and they have had the problem of a heavy workload 
with their offices understaffed in dealing with the open 
competitive tender system. 
  In January this year, the central government decided on "the 
action plan for improvement in the procedures of bids and 
contracts for public works projects" in an attempt to shift from 
the conventional designated tender system to the open 
competitive tender system for the public works projects. The 
central government and its agencies intend to put the action 
plan into effect within this year, at the latest and the 
prefectural and municipal governments are in the process of 
reviewing their conventional designated tender systems in 
accordance with the action plan. 
  According to the action plan, the standard amount for the 
prefectural and municipal governments to adopt the open 
competitive tender system for public works projects is more than 
2.43 billion yen, far higher than "more than 730 million yen" 
for the central government. Explaining the reason for the 
difference, the Construction Ministry says if the standard 
amount is set at a low level from the beginning for the 
prefectural and municipal governments, it would create a heavy 
workload and confusion for the governments. 
  Twenty prefectural governments, including Hokkaido, 
Kanakawa, 
Osaka, and Kumamoto, have already adopted the open competitive 
tender system or decided when to adopt the new tender system. 
Of the municipal governments, Sendai, Niigata, Kyoto, Sapporo, 
Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have decided to adopt the new tender 
system. Twenty-five other prefectural and five municipal 
governments, including Tokyo, Chiba, and Nagoya, are 
experimenting with the open competitive tender system. 
  Of the 20 prefectural governments, 10, including Hokkaido, 
Osaka, and Saga, have decided to adopt the open competitive 
tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.43 
billion yen in accordance with the action plan, with the 
exception of Akita Prefecture that has decided to adopt the new 
tender system for public works projects worth more than 2.5 
billion yen. The remaining 10 prefectural governments have 
decided to lower the standard amount to about 0.5-1 billion yen, 
citing the small size of their public works projects. They have 
vowed to "increase the transparency of their biddings." 
  Of six municipal governments that have already adopted the 
open competitive tender system or decided to adopt the new 
tender system, Sapporo, Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Fukuoka have 
decided to adopt the new tender system in accordance with the 
action plan, but Sendai has decided to lower the standard amount. 
  Of 25 prefectural governments that are experimenting with 
the 
new tender system, only four -- Iwate, Fukuoka, Miyazaki, and 
Kagoshima -- have decided to apply the open competitive tender 
system to public works projects worth more than 2.43 billion yen 
and the remaining prefectural governments have lowered the 
standard amount at the experimental stage. 
  Almost all prefectural and municipal governments pointed out 
the high cost of handling the new tender system when they 
experimented with it. In the case of the prefectural 
governments: "It took 60 days for them to announce biddings and 
hold them, and the amount is about four times that taken under 
the conventional designated tender system" (according to Iwate 
Prefecture). Osaka city says: "The cost of printing bid 
materials was high because a large number of construction firms 
participated in bids for the public works projects." Ehime 
Prefecture points out that "in the past, four staff spent only 
15 minutes handling the designated tender system, but 14 staff 
members have to spend as long as one hour handling the open 
competitive tender system." 
  Many prefectural governments point out: 1) the need to deal 
with grievances by construction companies that fail to win 
contracts; 2) substandard work resulting from underbidding; and, 
3) the monopoly of contracts by financially powerful 
construction firms based in other prefectures.

  [Text] The Patent Office has begun to study revision of 
the Patent Law to enable foreign individuals and corporations to 
present their patent applications in English. So far, patent 
applications have been allowed to be made only in Japanese. 
This will make the expedited review of patent applications for 
technology from overseas applicants possible. 
  The patents issue is an important item on the agenda of the 
Japan-U.S. economic consultations, and the United States insists 
that the requirement for applying in Japanese only has worked as 
a trade barrier. The Patent Office has come to believe the 
revision will lead to growth of not only applications from the 
United States, but also of such English-speaking regions as 
Europe and Oceania. The office plans to present the revision 
bill to the Diet's extraordinary session in the Fall for 
enactment from July 1995. 
  The current Patent Law does not accept applications in 
English, which means overseas inventors can submit their 
applications only after translating the contents of the invented 
technology into Japanese. Moreover, at present, correction of 
submitted translations is not allowed in principle. 
  Sometimes problems occur of misinterpretation as a result of 
hasty translation done in order to submit applications as 
quickly as possible and of inventors failing to get patents 
approved as a result of this. For instance, when a U.S. company 
applied for a patent on the technology of junctioning nickel 
alloys, boron [hoso] was mistranslated as shuso [bromine], and 
the company was unable to win the patent even though it brought 
the matter to the Tokyo Appellate Court for review. 
  Under the revised law, the foreign applicants: 1) Will be 
allowed to submit their patent applications in English on the 
condition that Japanese translations will be submitted within 
two months after submission of applications; and 2) will be 
allowed to make corrections on mistranslations, if any, within 
three months of the Patent Office announcement of "not approving 
a patent" at the end of a review period. 
  Japan receives about 34,000 patent applications from foreign 
nationals each year, and the number is close to 10 percent of 
the total 370,000 applications received nationally. As for 
types of inventions applied for, those which compete with 
Japanese-pioneered technologies such as semiconductors are 
growing. As such, the merits of making quick applications in 
English without taking the time to translate them into Japanese 
will be substantial. The Patent Office said: "This means 
setting up a system wherein patent approval review will be done 
on terms equal to those for Japanese inventions. It should 
contribute to alleviating the trade surplus which the United 
States charges is unfair. 
  In January 1994, the Japanese and U.S. Governments agreed to 
revise the Patent Laws of the two nations in part toward the 
goal of unifying their patent systems, and this revision of the 
law will be the first action taken under the agreement. The 
next step Japan wants to take is to ask the United States to 
change its current system of basing its patent rights on who 
"first invented" to one used by Japan and Europe of basing it on 
who "first applied."

  [Text] On 30 April, the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] decided to repeal three export-related laws: 
the Export Inspection Law, the Export Commodity Design Law, and 
the Law on Unified Trademarks for Export Commodities by Small 
and Medium Enterprises. All of the laws were enacted to improve 
the quality of manufactured goods exported by small and medium 
enterprises and promote the exports of manufactured goods by 
those enterprises. MITI, which is presently reviewing Japan's 
current trade system to relax bureaucratic regulations, has 
concluded that the three laws have finished their roles since 
Japan has shifted to a policy of boosting imports and the small 
and medium enterprises have made technological progress. 
  MITI intends to repeal the Export Inspection Law and the 
Export Commodity Design Law in 1997 and the Law on Unified 
Trademarks for Export Commodities by Small and Medium 
Enterprises this year. 
  The Export Inspection Law stipulates that manufactured goods 
designated by the government cannot be exported unless they pass 
export inspection; the government regulation designates 50 items 
that are manufactured mainly by small and medium enterprises and 
they include binoculars, eyeglasses, metal toys, silk fabrics, 
underwear, green tea, and soy source. The export inspection 
system under the law will be kept in effect if any small or 
medium enterprise wants their export goods inspected. 
  The Export Commodity Design Law stipulates that manufactured 
goods cannot be exported unless government offices in charge of 
export certification check whether the trademark of manufactured 
goods intended for export are identical with their registered 
trademark. Seven items, including fountain pens, furniture, and 
lacquer ware, are subject to the check.

  [Text] Five domestic semiconductor wafer makers plan to 
drastically increase production of 8-inch silicon wafers during 
the current fiscal year. Shin-Etsu Semiconductor Co. Ltd., the 
largest among the five companies, plans to begin operating a new 
plant in Malaysia in July. In addition, the company plans to 
enlarge its facilities in both Japan and the United States in 
order to double its current production to 200,000 units monthly. 
Sumitomo Shichikkusu Co. [name as published] plans to invest a 
total of 10 billion yen in plants and equipment to double its 
monthly output to 140,000 units by the first half of fiscal year 
1995. The other three major silicon wafer makers are Komatsu 
Electronic Metals Co. (located in Hiratsuka, Kanagawa 
Prefecture); Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. (located in Noda, 
Chiba Prefecture); and Toshiba Ceramics Co.; together, the five 
wafer makers will double their current total output to 
450,000-500,000 units monthly. Wafer makers plan to step up 
their output sharply because domestic semiconductor makers have 
successively indicated plans to use 8-inch wafers for their 
products. 
  Shin-Etsu, which supplies nearly 50 percent of the required 
amount of 8-inch wafers in Japan, plans to double its current 
monthly output of 100,000 units to 200,000 units during the 
current fiscal year. The first phase has been completed in the 
construction of an 8-inch wafer manufacturing plant in Malaysia 
for which the company plans to spend a total of 20 billion yen. 
The new plant will start operating in July with a capacity to 
produce 65,000 units monthly. The company also plans to step up 
8-inch wafer production at the Shirakawa factory (located in 
Fukushima Prefecture), its principal factory, and the "SEH 
America," its subsidiary manufacturing company in the United 
States. 
  Sumitomo Shichikkusu plans to gradually build up its 
facilities at the Imari factory (located in Saga Prefecture) and 
increase its current monthly output of 70,000 units to 100,000 
units during the current fiscal year. It then plans to increase 
monthly output to 140,000 units in the first half of fiscal year 
1995. It expects to spend a total of 10 billion yen in the 
process. 
  Komatsu Electronic Metals Co. plans to build up its 
principle 
factory in Nagasaki to increase its current monthly output of 
30,000-40,000 units to 60,000-70,000 units during the current 
fiscal year. 
  Mitsubishi Material Silicon Co. also plans to double its 
current monthly output of 40,000 units to 80,000 units during 
the current fiscal year. In addition to building up its Ikuno 
factory (located in Hyogo Prefecture), the company now plans to 
start manufacturing 8-inch wafers at "Syntech," its U.S. 
subsidiary. 
  Toshiba Ceramics Co. plans to increase its current monthly 
output of several thousand units to 10,000 units during the 
current fiscal year. The company supplies silicon wafers mainly 
to Toshiba Corporation. 
  In view of a shift to full-fledged production of 16-megabit 
dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, semiconductor makers, 
such as the NEC Corporation and Hitachi Ltd., plan to use 8-inch 
wafers since these yield 200 chips, while 6-inch wafers yield 
only 100 chips.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Former Deputy Prime Minister </F>
Michio Watanabe of the LDP by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 28 April; place 
not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you give your comments on 
the newly formed cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata? 
  [Watanabe] I thought the coalition might leave some cabinet 
posts open and headhunt senior members of the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to 
fill vacancies in six cabinet posts (which were occupied by the 
SDPJ under the Hosokawa administration). So I am glad to see 
they filled the cabinet posts at once. I think the cabinet 
lineup is satisfactory, considering the people the coalition had 
available. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion on calls for 
dissolution of the lower house or the mass resignation of the 
cabinet immediately after enactment of the fiscal 1995 budget? 
  [Watanabe] At the end of the ongoing session, the Diet will 
have to discuss scandals (involving former Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa) and other pending issues, and a no-confidence 
motion may be brought forward depending on manners (of the Hata 
administration). If the SDPJ supports the motion, the Hata 
cabinet would have to decide whether to resign en masse or 
dissolve the lower house. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Hata cabinet is forced to resign, 
do you think it is possible to form a coalition government made 
up of the LDP and SDPJ? 
  [Watanabe] If the two parties form a coalition without a 
clear policy accord, the administration will meet the same fate 
as the Hosokawa administration. It would be difficult (to form 
a full-fledged administration of the two parties). The 
resignation of the Hata cabinet is more likely to result in a 
realignment of political parties. The SDPJ should take a more 
realistic attitude toward security ties with the United States. 
With respect to legislation for emergency situations (in 
connection with the Korean peninsula), Japan cannot be freed 
from logistics support duties. (In the case of an emergency), 
the Self-Defense Forces are supposed to supply fuel and 
provisions to U.S. vessels in operation. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say confusion in political 
circles should be cleared up by an immediate general election. 
Do you agree? 
  [Watanabe] I think that is the due process of constitutional 
politics. It would not hurt the political reform laws. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you describe the LDP's strategy for 
winning back ruling power? 
  [Watanabe] I believe the LDP must try harder to change its 
negative image, as its policies are widely supported by the 
public. Of course, the LDP's drastic renovation may include a 
change of the party's name. The question here is whether or not 
we are ready to take action. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono is critical of 
the political manners of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa. What is your comment on that point? 
  [Watanabe] So many people think so, and I was surprised when 
I noticed how many people dislike him. I did not realize it at 
all. They say he is too opinionated and secretive. In fact, the 
people are afraid of his dictatorship under the single-seat 
constituency system. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] But, Mr. Watanabe, you are still looking 
for a policy-oriented merger of conservative parties, are you 
not? 
  [Watanabe] I have been saying it is more natural to join 
forces with those who have common goals and methodology. I 
wonder why everybody does not do that. Politics must not be run 
on grudges. Based on emotions, people are saying they hate the 
LDP and some other parties. He (Ozawa) also has some points 
which merit blame; he should correct his manners a little. I 
think he is a man of deed who has clear ideas. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you and President Kono win back the 
LDP's ruling position? 
  [Watanabe] I am not sure about that until I actually face 
the situation. At the least, I will try.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yoshio Terasawa, director general of the </F>
Economic Planning Agency, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; date and 
place not given] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you want to achieve 
while in office? 
  [Terasawa] I want to see an administration that takes 
markets into account. I have the experience of having worked 
for private companies. I think I can make myself unique by 
putting the experience of having been in a market economy to 
good use. I would like to take timely action to deal with the 
problem of commodity price gaps existing between Japan and other 
countries, deregulation, and improvement of market access. 
Besides, I would like to be a mediator within the government 
who works from the viewpoint of making the lives of consumers 
more abundant. Doing deskwork is not good enough. It is 
necessary to absorb voices from wide areas of the private sector 
all the time. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you view the current state of 
the economy? 
  [Terasawa] I consider the high yen problem as serious. The 
auto and high-tech industries which are supposed to be 
competitive are having a hard time because of the high yen 
value. Meanwhile, restructuring of companies will proceed. As 
far as we can see from the perspective of gains in business 
income and investments in plants and equipment, the poor state 
of economy will continue. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the recent yen 
moves on the market? 
  [Terasawa] The exchange market being violently pushed around 
by speculators is not desirable. I would like to see a market 
that reflects economic fundamentals. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is strong criticism that the 
Economic Planning Agency [EPA] judgment on the economy is wrong. 
Do you think the government prediction (of 2.4 percent in 
growth) is achievable? 
  [Terasawa] Certainly, past judgments have been wrong. The 
EPA takes the criticism solemnly, and will make maximum possible 
efforts to help economic predictions prove correct. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you intend to revise the economic 
plan (five-year economic plan to become a lifestyle superpower) 
adopted during the Miyazawa government? 
  [Terasawa] Three years have passed since the plan was 
adopted. The Economic Council (prime minister's advisory body) 
is checking on the progress being made on the plan. I am not 
thinking about revising it as yet. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The EPA is often cited as an 
"unnecessary government office." 
  [Terasawa] The EPA has competent economists working for it, 
and I think it is an important office which has the duty of 
defending individual consumers and the public. We will be able 
to defend the EPA's raison d'etre as long as we perform the jobs 
expected of us. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have long worked in the 
securities industry. Using your experience, could you tell me 
whether the current average stock of price of about 20,000 yen 
is appropriate? 
  [Terasawa] Six years have passed since I left Kabuto-cho. I 
have since worked in international organizations and later as a 
Diet member. I have lost a sense of it as I have been away from 
the industry for so long; I know nothing about stocks now.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Rehabilitation of U.S. Ties Is An Urgent </F>
Issue"] 
  [Text] Repairing ties with the United States is an urgent 
task for the newly formed Hata cabinet. The Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks lie at the center of the overall readjustment of 
the post-Cold War relationship between the two countries; 
however, the talks remain bogged down with no set schedule for 
their resumption. 
  Washington predicates such resumption on Japan's pledge to 
establish a long-term plan to cut its trade surplus, carry out 
an income tax cut, and augment its public works program. 
  As a minority regime, the Hata cabinet is likely to face 
difficulties in complying with U.S. demands to map out tangible 
measures for implementing Japan's "economic reform outline" by 
the end of June. Thus, it will be very difficult to fully 
rehabilitate U.S. ties by the time the G-7 summit meeting is 
held in Naples in July. 
  We urge Prime Minister Hata to strive to prevent Japan-U.S. 
ties from deteriorating, despite these difficulties. As he 
stood at the forefront of economic talks as foreign minister, he 
knows the core issues, and is acquainted with his U.S. 
counterparts. 
  However, among those Americans, Hata has a negative image as 
a politician having close relations with the Japanese 
bureaucracy which they dislike--in contrast to former Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who was welcomed with a measure of 
personal trust by President Bill Clinton. Thus, the United 
States is likely to make even more drastic demands on Hata. 
  Hata needs to emphasize to the nation that we stand at a 
dangerous crossroads in our relationship with Washington. Also, 
he should demonstrate good faith to the United States in his 
quest for better ties. 
  Some executives in the Japanese private sector maintain good 
communication channels with American business and political 
leaders. Instead of allowing himself to remain the puppet of 
bureaucrats, Hata should utilize his own counselors to build a 
communications network with the Clinton administration. And he 
should avoid exclusively depending on the Foreign Ministry for 
intelligence gathering and negotiating strategy. 
  At the same time, Hata is urged not to be unduly hasty about 
attaining success. During the G-7 summit in Tokyo last year, 
the then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yielded too much to 
Clinton over the framework talks, giving the latter inflated 
hopes for numerical targets and sowing the seeds of calamity in 
the subsequent negotiations. Inasmuch as Hata is regarded by 
many as a short-term caretaker premier, he should be prepared to 
leave the knotty problems to his successor. 
  The DPRK (North Korea) nuclear controversy remains a time 
bomb in the Japan-U.S. security relationship. Whereas Japan, 
the United States, and the ROK are keeping pace, they have 
potential problems involving sanctions and otherwise dealing 
with this crisis. 
  On this question, Hata is called upon to seek a national 
consensus, within the Constitution and on the basis of the 
security treaty with the United States. The situation is fluid, 
requiring possible emergency measures. 
  In the meantime, the prime minister should urge Washington 
to 
continue patient diplomatic efforts with Pyongyang toward a 
peaceful settlement and avoid sanctions, keeping in mind that 
China has the strongest card to play in allaying the dispute. 
  On the diplomatic front, in addition to home affairs, Hata's 
job dovetails with reform in this country. At the heart of this 
endeavor lies deregulation. There is a dire need for Japan to 
increase imports, simplify national administration and finances, 
and inspire entrepreneurship among medium and small business 
through deregulation. 
  Frankly, however, a strong and stable political process to 
make such reform possible is still not likely emerge in the 
immediate future. More likely, Hata will be forced to adopt a 
realistic course to respond to immediate challenges as they 
arise. As such, Washington is called upon to treat the Hata 
administration with understanding and flexibility.

  [Text] The scheduled visit to the United States by the 
director general of the Defense Agency [DA] has been canceled. 
DA officials are concerned over the possible influence of his 
cancellation on Japanese relations with the United States 
because Kanda was originally scheduled to hold talks with 
Secretary of Defense Perry prior to the May expiration date for 
responses to the UN Security Council chairman's statement on 
measures to deal with the suspected nuclear arms development by 
the DPRK (North Korea). The Security Consultative Council will 
hold its meeting at the bureau-chief level as scheduled. 
However, it has been said within the DA that "the United States 
may doubt Japan's approach towards crisis management." 
  If former DA Director-General Kazuo Aichi had been 
reappointed, it was originally planned that he would visit the 
United States beginning 1 May. However, immediately following 
the replacement of Aichi by Atsushi Kanda of the Democratic 
Socialist Party after the new cabinet was formed on 28 April, it 
was decided the visit should be postponed since "few results 
would be achieved due to insufficient preparations." According 
to a DA source: "Kanda did not insist on paying a visit to the 
United States." 
  The original plan for the DA leader's visit did not include 
discussions only on measures to deal with the North Korean 
issue. The visit was also aimed at "somehow or other improving 
Japan-U.S. relations which have become rather stiff as a result 
of economic and trade friction, appealing to the fact the two 
nations still maintain a honeymoon relationship in security." 
As far as the Hata administration is concerned, it would have 
been the first visit to the United States by a cabinet member of 
the minority-ruled administration. 
  Director General Kanda states: "I will give positive 
consideration to the visit if there should be any changes in 
North Korea." There is a growing hope within the Agency "that 
his visit to the United States will take place in June." 
However, when the long consecutive holidays come to an end, the 
cabinet will be busily engaged in deliberations over the draft 
budget bill for fiscal 1994. Since the future prospects for the 
cabinet remain cloudy, it seems most likely those concerned will 
have to share continuous concerns over this country's relations 
with the United States.

  [Text] During talks with reporters in Naha city on 30 
April, Kosuke Uehara disclosed that he would seek to establish a 
"grand union of doves" by gathering forces advocating protection 
of the Constitution from Sakigake [Harbinger], the Democratic 
Socialist Party, and a liberal group in the Liberal Democratic 
Party. Uehara is a member of the Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ], and former director general of the National Land 
Agency and Hokkaido and Okinawa Development Agency. On the 
formation of a "grand union of doves," Uehara said: "It will 
formulate its policies toward the Japan-U.S. security pact, 
Self-Defense Forces, and foreign affairs based on the agreement 
made when the coalition government was inaugurated."

  [Text] In a MAINICHI SHIMBUN interview on 1 May, Chairman 
Akira Yamagishi of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation 
criticized Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa's stance toward the 
Constitution. Kakizawa, at a news conference after his 
assumption of office, expressed positive attitude toward 
constitutional debates to formulate emergency legislative 
arrangements and approve collective self-defense rights. 
Yamagishi harshly said: "This is a very serious problem that a 
man, who had been a member of the Liberal Democratic Party only 
10 days before, became the foreign minister of the coalition 
administration, and made irresponsible remarks. He should be 
blamed." He said that this issue should be discussed at the 
Budget Committee. 
  In addition, he noted: "The security issue can be a reason 
for presenting the no-confidence motion against the cabinet. 
There is a great possibility that this issue will result in the 
dissolution of the House of Representatives." Moreover, 
touching on the policy agreement reached among the coalition 
parties, including the Social Democratic Party of Japan, 
Yamagishi pointed out: "The agreement does not say that the 
coalition parties should positively discuss this issue. Unless 
he approves the agreement, it is impossible for him to join the 
coalition." 
  With regard to the dissolution of the lower house to conduct 
a general election, he predicted that, "at the earliest, it will 
be conducted after the summit talks in early July." He further 
said: "It is most desirable to carry out the election under the 
new election system. However, if it is physically impossible, 
there will be no choice but to conduct the election under the 
present system."

  [Text] Amid growing attention to the possible dissolution 
of the House of Representatives and a general election following 
passage of the 1994 fiscal budget bill, Wataru Kubo, general 
secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], and 
Masayoshi Takemura, the leader of Sakigake [Harbinger], held 
respective news conferences on 2 May. In separate news 
conferences, the two indicated their stand that the next House 
of Representatives general elections should not adhere to the 
new electoral system--an electoral system combining single-seat 
and proportional representation constituencies. Prime Minister 
Tsutomu Hata is eager to submit to the Diet a bill for electoral 
districts as soon as possible, and hopes to hold general 
elections under the new electoral system. But if the SDPJ and 
Sakigake, which advocated elections under the new electoral 
system when they were members of Hosokawa's coalition 
government, should support a dissolution of the Diet and 
elections under the current electoral system, the move towards 
holding a general election under the current multiple 
constituency system will gain further momentum because there is 
a similar move within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. 
  Speaking at the news conference in Kagoshima, SDPJ General 
Secretary Kubo said: "We passed political reform bills, so we 
have a responsibility to carry out political reform. Holding an 
election under the current electoral system is imprudent." 
However, he added: "If public opinion requires it, or if 
parliamentary democracy is damaged, then it may be necessary to 
dissolve the parliament and hold general elections under the 
current multiple-seat constituency system." In this way, he 
indicated there is a possibility the lower house will be 
dissolved and general elections will be held under the current 
electoral system depending on the situation. 
  Kubo then expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that a 
study is underway by the Hata cabinet seeking ways to recognize 
the right to collective defense and to establish emergency 
defense legislation. He added that the government's actions 
dealing with security issues, former Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
100 million yen loan, and tax reform are the key to the future 
political situation. He pointed out that a general election may 
be held if one of the above issues creates a controversy and 
instigates a political crisis. 
  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura held his news conference 
at the Shiga Prefectural Office in Otsu, indicating his 
prospects for a general election. He stated: "I hope the 
redistricting plan will be drafted at an early date, and that 
the next election will be held under the new electoral system." 
He added: "I will not stick to the new electoral system if the 
situation requires an election under the current electoral 
system to ensure the stabilization of politics." Underlying 
this remark is his view that if a no-confidence motion is 
submitted against the cabinet by the LDP following passage of 
the 1994 budget bill, then the dissolution of the Diet and 
general elections under the current electoral system are 
unavoidable. 
  On 15 April, when it decided to leave the coalition yet 
support the cabinet from outside, Sakigake announced "it will 
make efforts to swiftly pass the bills submitted by the Hosokawa 
cabinet, including the political reform bills." Before the 2 
May news conference, Takemura said "there is a strong 
possibility the lower house will be dissolved within this year" 
and general elections will be held under the new electoral 
system.

<F P=106> [Interview with Home Affairs Minister Hajime Ishii, by </F>
YOMIURI SHIMBUN; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] When do you think the council on 
redistricting the House of Representatives electoral districts 
can come up with its recommendation on redistricting? 
  [Ishii] We expect the council to come up with its 
recommendations fairly soon. We hope the redistricting bill 
will be deliberated and acted on at the current session of the 
Diet. But of course, we will never interfere in the council's 
review process. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The reality is that there is a growing 
possibility the lower house will be dissolved for a general 
election under the current medium electoral system. 
  [Ishii] The next general election should be conducted under 
the new election system. After all, what is the purpose of the 
political reform we have fought for? 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your view of the reorganization of 
the political world? 
  [Ishii] Under the single-seat district system with 
proportional representation combined, gradually there will be 
development moves toward formation of a two-party system. Once 
that system takes root, it will become necessary to readjust the 
numbers elected from the single-seat system and the proportional 
representation system, raising the number elected from the 
single- seat system. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Hata government appears to be led by 
Shinseito and Komeito. 
  [Ishii] If the Social Democratic Party of Japan decides to 
participate in the coalition, we (Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party]) will vacate our (cabinet) posts promptly. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What progress are you making on the 
question of instituting "the local consumption tax" which is 
aimed at transferring more power to local governments and at 
enabling local governments to use part of the tax as their own 
financial resources. 
  [Ishii] I would like to see the issue of transferring more 
power to local governments make some progress while I am in 
office. As long as the system of the central government 
collecting taxes and distributing them to local governments 
continues, the existing state of excessive government 
centralization and of the Finance Ministry taking leadership can 
never be corrected. I would like to see local taxes play an 
important role. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What do you think about the question of 
instituting a system to enable Japanese residents overseas to 
vote? 
  [Ishii] We cannot let the matter drag on further. A bill 
should be ready in about a year from now.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Gill] </F>
  [Text] Tough U.S. trade action against China and Japan 
"would bring havoc and the dogs of war" to the whole 
Asia-Pacific region, according to a group of leading Australian 
and regional economists. 
  The dark potential of aggressive U.S. action is countered 
with suggestions that countries in the Asia-Pacific region must 
remain committed to free trade, accelerate trade liberalization, 
and draw the U.S. back into the so-called "open regionalism". 
  The Asia-Pacific Economics Group -- which includes 
Australian 
National University Professors Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale 
as principals and other economists from around the region -- 
criticizes the current thrust of U.S. trade policy but maintains 
that America cannot be isolated and ignored by countries in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
  The latest Asia Pacific Profiles -- published yesterday by 
the Asia-Pacific Economics Group in conjunction with Ernst and 
Young -- paints a picture of continued growth in East Asia in 
1994. 
  Among the majors, the profiles suggest Japan will return to 
growth, the boom conditions in China will ease slightly, Korea's 
growth rate will increase marginally, and Hong Kong, Taiwan, 
Indonesian, and Malaysia will generally match existing growth 
rates. 
  In an extensive discussion of the troubled trade policy 
environment, the economists encourage countries in the region to 
further liberalize trade and effectively remove the incentive 
for unilateral U.S. action. "What the Western Pacific can 
reasonably demand from the United States is genuine commitment 
to the rules and spirit of the multilateral system, and 
consultation within APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] on 
proposed departures from them," the latest Profiles says. "The 
withdrawal of most-favoured-nation treatment (by the U.S.) from 
one country (China) is a threat to the multilateral system as 
well as to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation: "The same can be 
said of unilateral punitive action (by the U.S. against Japan) 
under Super 301. There would be no neat containment of the 
consequences of such action to U.S. bilateral relations with 
particular countries. It would bring havoc and the dogs of war 
to the whole region." 
  Against such a disturbing backdrop, Professor Garnaut and 
Professor Drysdale argue that countries in the region should 
accelerate trade liberalization plans -- even to the point of 
allowing the U.S. to "free ride" and gain benefits while not 
opening its own market further. 
  The economists flag their concern at the sudden reversal of 
fortunes in the trade arena after the "brilliant trade policy 
triple play" which saw the NAFTA [North American Free Trade 
Agreement] pass Congress and a successful APEC leaders meeting 
in Seattle in November and a conclusion to the Uruguay Round in 
December. "And now, four months after Seattle, it seems that 
the two sides of the Pacific, lying in the same bed of 
commitment to trade liberalization and free trade, have 
discovered that they have different dreams." 
  Professor Garnaut and Professor Drysdale attribute part of 
this scenario to the lag in perceptions across the Pacific that 
the economic center of gravity has moved west to East Asia. 
  "Americans underestimate the corrosion of their overwhelming 
power, and their capacity to lead by fiat. East Asians 
underestimate the expansion of their influence on the 
international system, and their responsibility for systemic 
leadership."

<F P=106> [Speech by King Norodom Sihanouk at national reconciliation </F>
day meeting with monks and laymen in the Royal Palace on 4 May 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted -- condemnation of recent attack 
on peace march in Battambang] I would like to recall that I have 
appealed for a cease-fire many times before, not just today. I 
also supported the previous peace marches, and I clearly 
appealed for an end to fighting, for peace in the interest of 
the motherland and the people. I have launched consecutive 
peace plans. These plans have been rejected one after another. 
They [the warring parties] only lend lip service to me. They 
invariably claim that they love Samdech Sihanouk and -- after I 
become king -- respect and venerate King Sihanouk, but they have 
never listened to me. They have never done what I wish them to 
do. They always find this or that excuse to carry on the war, 
which poses a serious danger to our nation. 
  I have never been happy with this war. For this reason, I 
have just launched another plan. I know it will be rejected 
again. This new plan is about a roundtable. This table is 
perfectly round. The palace has produced a roundtable that is 
completely round, waiting for Samdech Chea Sim, Samdech 
Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu 
Samphan to sit around it. Yet, this cannot be realized. Why? 
It is like this: Although in the past the obstacle was raised 
by the Royal Government and Parliament, now the Royal Government 
and Parliament have accepted all the conditions I set for peace, 
nonviolence, and the end of war. These conditions are: 
  1. A cease-fire everywhere, in all directions with all 
forces 
observing a complete standstill to ensure 100 percent peace for 
the people. Take, for example, the areas near Battambang town, 
at Treng, or near Thailand, at Poipet and Sisophon, both sides 
must stop fighting and observe a standstill. No one side is 
considered a winner or a loser. Their troops must be 
immobilized. They must not be taken out of their current 
positions. Consequently, no one has any pretext to charge that 
the king is siding with this or that party. No one will lose or 
gain anything. Everyone stays where he is. 
  2. Two generals from the Royal Government and two other 
generals chosen by Khieu Samphan or the party of Democratic 
Kampuchea [PDK] will be sent to meet the king in the Royal 
Palace to work under the king's command. The king will order 
them to observe and oversee this cease-fire so it would be a 
concrete and not just an empty cease-fire in words alone, a 
complete cease-fire everywhere. Teams of one general with 
another general representing the king will go everywhere by 
helicopter, plane, car, or boat in Cambodia to ensure peace in 
all provinces, districts, and communes. 
  3. Once such peace is ensured, a roundtable will be held. If 
Phnom Penh is believed not neutral, I propose that the 
roundtable be held in the palace of King Norodom Sihanouk near 
Pyongyang, the DPRK. The place is called Lake of Longevity. 
There is a lake in front of that palace just as there is the 
Tonle Sap River, Chattomuk -- the river juncture -- in front of 
our palace here. That palace is fronted by a lake and is 
surrounded by mountains. It is a very pleasant site. Our 
venerated supreme patriarch present here once visited it and 
knows that is is a very pleasant place. Should the two supreme 
patriarches wish, they may go and give some sermons to the 
attendants of the roundtable over there. This would be most 
desirable, and they may go along with me. 
  Therefore, we have a specific plan. Now, Samdech Krompreah 
Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen representing the Royal 
Government and Samdech Chea Sim representing Parliament -- the 
three samdeches who are leaders of the Kingdom of Cambodia -- 
have sent me an official letter clearly stating their full 
unconditional support for King Norodom Sihanouk's latest plan. 
They have said that they will fully follow the king's 
instructions. 
  Just before I came here to pay my respect to you, venerable 
monks, and greet all of you, my children, I received a multipage 
letter, a very long letter. Any one of the venerable monks, the 
elders, or the media who wishes to get a copy of this letter, 
please contact H.E. Truong Meali or H.E. Keo Putreaksmei, who 
are present here. 
  This confusing document does not tell exactly what the PDK 
really wishes to say. This is the letter signed by H.E. Khieu 
Samphan, chairman of the PDK. In this letter he does not reject 
the king's plan, but neither does he say he fully supports it. 
After beating around the bush for a moment, he concludes by 
accusing Vietnam, saying that this war and the subsequent 
suffering of our people stem from the Vietnamese. So, he puts 
all the blame on the Vietnamese. Secondly, verbally, that is, in 
writing -- of course, he cannot use any weapons to do so on 
paper -- he seriously attacks this side, meaning Samdech 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen of the Royal Government. 
  If the war between the two sides goes on, our Buddhist 
religion, our kingdom, motherland, people, and nation will soon 
be extinct because of endless killings. Moreover, if we become 
weak, our neighbors will take the opportunity to swallow our 
land little by little and subjugate us until we lose not only 
independence but also our territorial integrity. Presently, you 
-- venerable monks, nuns, elders, brothers, children, and 
grandchildren -- should know that our territorial integrity, our 
land and maritime territory is shrinking perilously. Our 
borders that under Sangkum Reas Niyum were vast now have shrunk 
so much because some neighboring countries -- let us not name 
them -- have not stopped infringing on our land and gradually 
moving the border markers into our country. 
  [Excerpt] We now have lost countless square kilometers of 
territory as a result of that action. Not only one but two to 
three countries are taking advantage of our squabblings, our 
fratricidal disputes to gradually grab and swallow our 
territory. Venerable monks, they have already annexed a big 
chunk of our land. If we refuse to end the civil war, they will 
one day swallow all of our country. One day, venerable monks, 
only Phnom Penh will be left, the rest of the country grabbed by 
other countries. As for our sea, the same thing is happening to 
it. The maritime borders of the Sangkum Reas Niyum era are no 
longer recognized. This shows that we are very weak, that we 
are not as strong as we were under Sangkum Reas Niyum. For this 
reason, we are losing our territorial waters to other countries. 
They are grabbing our sea little by little. Soon, there will be 
no sea left. Not just the fish but the sea will be lost, and we 
will be landlocked. 
  If the gentlemen of the Khmer Rouge and those of the other 
side are bent on fighting each other, it means that all of you 
are traitors because you will be responsible for the demise of 
our nation. The nation will not succumb right away. It will 
die a slow death that will take 10 or 20 years. This is because 
the other countries are swallowing our territory little by 
little every year. We will have only Phnom Penh left in 10 or 20 
years. After Phnom Penh, there will be nothing left. 
  Therefore, I would like to say that the demonstration that 
you -- venerable monks, nuns, elders, and compatriots -- are 
staging today is a very g?od thing. We must arouse the 
conscience of the warriors, urging them to stop fighting and to 
agree to solve the problem at the roundtable. I am very 
flexible toward the Khmer Rouge. I am telling them that if they 
do not want to hold the roundtable in Phnom Penh, they are 
invited to go to the palace near Pyongyang, which is also 
Cambodian territory. This palace was donated to me by President 
Kim Il-song of the DPRK as a territory of Cambodia. So, the 
honors will be preserved 100 percent if we go to that palace. 
  However, in his letter that I received this morning -- 
although in the past he was glad to hear the name of that palace 
mentioned -- H.E. Khieu Samphan is not happy at all now. He 
says he wants to go somewhere else more neutral. Where is the 
place that is more neutral? Where does he want to go? Does he 
want to go to his allies' place? That place would not be 
neutral at all. If he wants to meet in a place belonging to a 
country that sides with him, he is not asking for a neutral 
venue. The same thing applies to this side. If the gentlemen 
on this side want to meet in a country that sympathizes with 
them, they are not asking to meet at a neutral venue. A neutral 
venue is one that sides with no party. 
  As for me, I am neutral brecause I am the parent of the 
whole 
Cambodian nation. I am the parent not only of the Royal 
Government and Parliament but also of the Khmer Rouge. These 
children, though they do not listen to me and keep on killing 
and murdering, are also my children because they are fellow 
Khmers. I have never disowned them. The Phnom Penh side has 
demanded that Parliament adopt a law proclaiming the Khmer Rouge 
outlaws [preceding word in French and repeated in English], 
rebels that we must reject from society. I have opposed this 
law and refused to sign it because I want to keep the door open 
for reconciliation. If this law is passed, there is no hope of 
reconciliation. If such a law is promulgated, there will be 
fighting and killing until Cambodia drops dead. 
  Therefore, I would like to appeal to the Khmer Rouge to 
think 
hard and stop painting everything as Vietnamese. You should be 
aware that the fighting is taking place between Khmers. Do not 
use the Vietnamese as an excuse to block out peace. Presently, 
the Khmer Rouge are gaining. They are winning battles. This 
means that if they keep fighting they will win more. This is 
because the government army is finished because too many of its 
troops are demoralized. The officers seem to be all right, but 
the rank and file has no incentives. They are lowly paid, and 
some months they receive no pay at all. In the battles they see 
that they are fighting only fellow Khmers and not soldiers of 
any aggressive nations. Moreover, they know they are getting 
nothing out of the war. They experience only misery and death. 
Even in death they do not know for whom they die. Are they 
dying for the nation? Most of them do not believe that they are 
dying for the nation in the current war. So, the soldiers who 
shoulder the brunt of the fighting are demoralized. There is no 
way to win a battle with demoralized soldiers. The Khmer Rouge 
knows that the soldiers on this side have a low morale. They 
take the advantage by launching heavier attacks and forcing the 
government troops to pull back. When retreat becomes debacle, 
they will capture Battambang town, Poipet, Sisophon, Samraong 
Chongkal, Tbeng Meanchey, and so on and one day they will be 
able to seize Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom as they did in 1976. 
They will push ahead and seize Pursat and Kompong Thom. 
  So, they see that they are gaining ground. Of course, they 
dare not say no to the king's new plan because the king is the 
only one who still befriends them -- who else is on good terms 
with the Khmer Rouge? No one on this side. So, fearing total 
isolation, they do not say no in the letter, but they do not say 
yes, either. They neither reject the king's plan nor accept it. 
Therefore, it is a stagnant situation. 
  In conclusion, I have the following to say to succinctly 
inform you: 
  First, I will carry on the peace effort. Venerable monks, I 
am still sick. A few days ago, French and Cambodian doctors 
took samples of my blood for examination. They found out that 
my health is not good. My white blood cell count is dangerously 
low. My illness has recurred because of fatigue. The daily 
work program to which I have submitted myself since my return 
has been too taxing and as a result the cancer has recurred. 
Moreover, the clogging of my blood vessels has also worsened. 
So, my Chinese doctor has ordered me to return to the hospital 
as soon as possible. He said I cannot wait for another three or 
four weeks. He asked me to go as soon as possible. 
  [Excerpt] Therefore, I am not in very good shape. I might 
die in the very near future. So, what I wish to tell you is 
this: Until my death, I will not desert you; I will continue to 
struggle and get peace for you at all costs to defend our 
independence and territorial integrity and keep our country 
alive, not only for just a dozen more years but for generations 
to come, so that our great- grandchildren can live on Cambodian 
soil as in the time of Sangkum Reas Niyum. 
  Moreover, I would like to tell you frankly, venerable monks, 
that no one is paying much attention to Sihanouk. Now, it 
appears that these warriors seem not to be listening to even the 
venerable monks. To whom will they listen, then? This is why I 
have begged the two venerable supreme patriarches, Samdech Preah 
Pouthiveang, and Samdech Preah Mongkol Proettheacha to help me. 
Yesterday, I listened to the very nice and enlightening sermon 
by Samdech Preah Mongkol Proettheacha. Please, help make 
appeals over the radio and on television, urging the conscience 
of Khieu Samphan and the PDK to agree to the roundtable. If the 
Khmer Rouge does not want to come to Phnom Penh, then convince 
them to go to the palace in North Korea. Make them hurry. The 
longer the delay, the worse it will for all of us. Venerable 
monks, please help me. 
  [Words indistinct] there is also the United Nations to turn 
to. However, it might not agree to come and help us because it 
has helped us once already, at great expenses and with minimal 
success. The Khmer Rouge does not listen to them. If I call on 
the United Nations to come and help us, maybe they will not 
come. Anyway, I will try writing to UN Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus Ghali, asking the United Nations to consider sending a UN 
force to help bring about reconciliation. Maybe they will not 
come because they are faced with so many other serious crises in 
the world, such as Bosnia-Herzegovinia and other hot spots where 
fighting is even more serious than in our country. The United 
Nations is busy with these problems, and maybe it does not have 
enough money and manpower to help us. Nonetheless, after 
attending this meeting, I will prepare a letter to the United 
Nations asking it to consider beefing up its presence here. 
Presently, there are 30 UN troops in Cambodia, but they are 
nearing the end of their mission. The other day, they came and 
bid me farewell. If we have more UN troops -- not for fighting 
but for reconciliation -- it would be good. However, the Khmer 
Rouge, who did not listen to them before, surely will not listen 
to them now if they come back. 
  So, we come to the conclusion that the Khmer Rouge listens 
to 
neither Sihanouk nor Samdech Preah Khousananda [leader of the 
peace march]. Now we are left with only the two supreme 
patriarchs, Samdech Preah Mongkol Proettheacha, Samdech Preah 
Pouthiveang, and Samdech Preah Khousana -- five top monks -- to 
try to persuade them through various media. However, if the 
Khmer Rouge does not listen to you, then we will be in a 
difficult situation. They say they believe in the king, but 
they do not listen to him. On this side, too -- to be frank -- 
they did not listen to me before. It is only after they 
suffered defeat under heavy Khmer Rouge blows that they seem to 
be paying any attention to me. However, this kind of attitude 
is not right: When they win they do not listen to me; it is only 
when they lose that they listen. With this attitude we cannot 
solve problems. Win or lose, you should listen to me. Only 
with this attitude can we solve problems. 
  No, I am not being acrimonious against or angry at the 
children on the Phnom Penh side, but to be frank, venerable 
monks, the children on the Phnom Penh side also do not listen to 
me. They claim to be reverential to me, but they do not listen 
to me. They were so boastful when they won some battles. Now 
that they are losing, they say they venerate the king and would 
follow all his instructions. This is serious. Both sides have 
serious flaws; neither is praiseworthy. Therefore, I ask both 
sides to think it over. Forget about who wins or loses, for in 
both cases it is Cambodia, it is the people who are the losers. 
How can we say that the people are the losers? It is because 
they are the ones who suffer misery, devastation, and 
separation. The people make up 99 percent of the population, 
and how many of you are there on both sides? It is not fair for 
just a few persons to plunge the whole nation into misery. It is 
time for both sides to think hard about that. 
  For example, this side said yesterday that they were winning 
battles again -- I do not know whether their claim is true. I 
am afraid if they are really winning they will become boastful 
again and stop listening to the king. My advice to them is: Do 
not indulge in such a game. Win or lose, just ignore it. The 
only thing that you should keep in mind is this: What can we do 
to avoid Cambodia becoming extinct in the next 10-20 years? You 
must have pity for the people, for the venerable monks, and for 
the 99 percent of the population that is suffering because of 
you. So, I demand that the bigshots on both sides stop behaving 
that way. [applause] 
  Venerable monks, I am not angry, but I have to shout a bit 
loudly to make myself heard in case they are deaf. [laughter] 
No, I am not angry, venerable monks. They are all my children. 
How can I be angry at them? However, I need to make them hear 
me. When they no longer enjoy the fanfare of victory, they say 
they hear me. When they do not want to hear me, they claim to 
be deaf. Sometime they say my words enter their heads through 
one ear and exit through another. They are never caught. I 
thus appeal to both sides to stop behaving erroneously. They 
should accept the Buddhist teachings and listen to the voice of 
Samdech Preah Khousananda in his peace march. If they listen to 
the chants of the venerable monks and uphold their sermons, 
peace and happiness will be ours. Thank you. [applause] Long 
live Buddhism!

<F P=106> [Address by First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh at </F>
the opening of the International Press Freedom Day in Phnom Penh 
on 3 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The first question is about a 
cease-fire and a roundtable. As all of you, ladies and 
gentlemen, have already been aware, after the audience, His 
Majesty met with both of us [Ranariddh and Hun Sen] and proposed 
to the royal government the cease-fire, a standstill, and the 
meeting with the Khmer Rouge at a roundtable. As you know, we 
already answered His Majesty when we saw him -- not just at this 
point in time -- that we are pleased to accept his proposal. In 
sum, the royal government is prepared to declare that it accepts 
an unconditional cease-fire, the standstill, and the proposal to 
set up a cease-fire observation committee with two generals 
representing the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] and two others 
representing the Khmer Rouge group [words indistinct]. We are 
always ready to participate in the roundtable meeting under His 
Majesty's chairmanship if the cease- fire becomes secure. His 
Majesty said the table would not be rectangular; it would 
definitely be round. This is to relieve His Excellency [H.E.] 
Khieu Samphan's anxiety about the problem of parity. 
  Besides, why did we inform His Majesty that we would not go 
to Jakarta or Paris? Because, as the king has said, if we (?are 
just brought to perform at the circus), the problem will not 
end. We have our national pride and prestige after the general 
elections organized by the United Nations. Our fellow 
countrymen, estimated to be about 89.7 percent of the total 
voters, overcame all manner of obstacles to cast their vote. 
This is evidence of their love for liberal democracy. As we 
have a Constitution, a fully independent and sovereign kingdom, 
a national assembly, a king, a royal government, and a country, 
we must talk to settle Cambodia's problems. Now the Khmer Rouge 
issue is a Cambodian problem, so it should be discussed in 
Cambodia. Moreover, we have a king. As the Constitution has 
clearly specified, although he has not yet become our Cambodian 
nation's parent, the king has a great mission to reconcile and 
unify the nation. So the king cannot go to other places except 
for our country. That being the case, the royal government has 
proposed that if there is a roundtable, the roundtable should 
take place in the Kingdom of Cambodia. Moreover, the Royal 
Palace belongs to His Majesty, who is regarded by all Cambodians 
as their own parent endowed with a neutral attribute. Does the 
Khmer Rouge group consider the king as a nonneutral person and 
the royal palace a nonneutral place? This is the position of 
the royal government. 
  Besides, we should also clarify that it was I who kept 
talking and staying with the Khmer Rouge. It was only after the 
1993 elections that I crossed to this side. Therefore, we 
already held a lot of rounds of talks, signed the [Paris] 23 
October 1991 accord, and participated in the elections. The 
Khmer Rouge group had ample opportunity to return to the 
national community. I do believe that now it is not yet late. 
The Khmer Rouge, like the kingdom and the royal government, 
must provide an immediate answer to the most correct proposal, 
which takes into account the people's aspiration for peace and 
which considers the royal palace as a neutral base for national 
reconciliation. This is the message I ask the national and 
international radios to help convey to H.E. Khieu Samphan. 
[applause] 
  As you know, I, Ranariddh, have been despised for several 
months. The Khmer Rouge continues to call me the FUNCINPEC 
[National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia] chairman, and now it has gone so far 
as to call me a French or American lackey or a mad dog. A 
Cambodian newspaper has even said that I have secretly met with 
the Khmer Rouge -- Ranariddh has no secret contacts; samdech 
prime minister [Hun Sen] has always been aware of those 
meetings. Because they do not want to come, I accept to act as 
a dog for the sake of peace. As I secretly met with the Khmer 
Rouge in Bangkok, some said that Ranariddh did not care about 
the government's fame and honor. I was willing to see him 
[Khieu Samphan] and talk with the hope that we were able to put 
an end to Cambodia's bloodshed. In light of what you 
[journalists] reported to the king yesterday, it can be 
understood that it is the royal government -- with the Khmer 
Rouge refusing to participate in the elections, accept the 
Constitution, recognize the National Assembly, lay down arms, 
and hold talks -- which wants to wage war. This is because the 
government is responsible for the war, which has dragged on in 
our Cambodian Kingdom. 
  No one else is better than I am. What more should I do? 
Some people may say: Look! After the fall of Anlung Veng and 
Pailin, now he is ready to negotiate a cease-fire. 
Nevertheless, the national and international media have not 
paid attention to what I have said. I met with Khieu Samphan 
before the events of Phnum Malai, Anlung Veng, Pailin, and so 
on. I asked him to declare a cease-fire. We were ready to talk 
at a round or rectangular table, but a cease-fire should be 
declared first. This is to establish an acceptable and 
appropriate basis for the talks. Therefore, it is not just now 
that we want to talk. I wish to clarify this again. 
  However, Khieu Samphan's only answer was: We cannot cease 
firing, and Your Highness Ranariddh should understand that the 
Vietnamese are attacking the patriots. I then said: If you say 
that, there is nothing left that we can negotiate. I went to 
talk about the Cambodian problems, but in his answers, H.E. 
Khieu Samphan said the Vietnamese were attacking and that the 
Vietnamese were preparing the 14th dry-season offensive. In 
1993, he still insisted that there was a 14th dry-season 
offensive. This means that talks, the elections, and the 
signing in Paris are all meaningless. 
  In sum, today we do not mean to whitewash ourselves. We 
still want to end the bloody war because our neighbors, as His 
Majesty has said, are extremely happy to see us continue to 
expose one another ceaselessly -- the Cambodians have a bad 
habit of asking for help from others when they are bickering 
among themselves. This is what the neighbors want us to do, and 
this is what we have continued to do so far. For 23 years, we 
have never wanted to stop or repent of what we have committed. 
  The royal government wishes to repeatedly state that it is 
ready to go to not only the Royal Palace but also Pyongyang. 
This is because Pyongyang is His Majesty's royal palace, 
Pyongyang is a parcel of Cambodian land. Before they were 
barred from staying in the Royal Palace, but now they can stay 
there as they please. The reason that we did not allow H.E. 
Khieu Samphan to stay in the Royal Palace was that we were of 
the opinion that His Majesty is the Cambodian people's own 
parent and a neutral person and that the Royal Palace is a 
neutral zone. So the conflicting parties should stay away from 
the neutral place. However, he disagrees. Now we have agreed 
to let him stay in the Royal Palace if he wishes. However, his 
answer is that Phnom Penh, Cambodia are not the neutral zones. 
Anyway, we are ready to go to Pyongyang, but we can in no way 
allow our sacred king (?to be used by them on stage again). We 
ask that the Cambodian people should not be used as monkeys at 
(?a circus). I really don't know what more to do. 
  National and international media have regarded Pailin, 
Anlung 
Veng as something gigantic. I also listened to France-Inter 
Radio. When the KRAF captured Pailin, the radio said nothing 
about that. However, when the Khmer Rouge retook Pailin, it 
reported about it every hour. There were also interviews with 
experts on Cambodian affairs. I would like you to ponder a bit. 
The Khmer Rouge occupied Pailin since 1989. The former State 
of Cambodia, although it made a great deal of effort, did not 
try to retake Pailin. This was due to the negotiations. 
Afterward, even H.E. Akashi [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia chief] was not able to enter Pailin, but the KRAF could 
do so. I do not want to raise the circumstances under which the 
KRAF were obliged to retreat. 
  I would like to ask you to be even-handed in the treatment 
of 
the issue. Could you just refrain from saying that the KRAF are 
defeated everywhere? Somehow, now can they do business in 
Pailin? 
  I have seen no paper reporting about the Khmer Rouge's 
destruction of our Cambodia's national environment, future, and 
natural resources in Pailin. Has anybody talked about the Khmer 
Rouge's giving foreigners a free hand to commit the destruction 
that constitutes the most heavy burden for our nation's future? 
Has anybody talked about the royal government's duty as 
stipulated in the Constitution's Article 3, saying that no group 
can divide Cambodia? Has anyone ever talked about this? Blame 
is always placed upon the government. 
  I come here just to beg and clarify. It it true that we have 
retreated from Anlung Veng, but Ta Mok has felled hundreds of 
thousand cubic meters of trees and sold them to a country, 
namely Thailand. The government does not want to win, but it 
does not want to lose, either. The government is prepared to 
talk, cease firing, and implement a standstill. It is also 
prepared to send two generals [to take part in the cease-fire 
observation committee] and participate in talks under the 
correct and lofty chairmanship of His Majesty, our sacred king. 
Is it like that? [Ranariddh asks Hun Sen] We are two, so from 
time to time we should ask each other for additional advice. In 
my capacity as the first prime minister, I think my 
clarification about the cease-fire that some of you raised with 
His Majesty is enough. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Message from King Norodom Sihanouk to Khieu Samphan, </F>
chairman of the party of Democratic Kampuchea, dated 3 May -- 
read by announcer] 
  [Text] Excellency, I am honored to inform the party of 
Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] of the following: 
  1. Abiding by the most enthusiastic, unanimous demand of our 
beloved compatriots, in my capacity as the king of the Kingdom 
of Cambodia I would like to urgently beseech the Royal 
Government of Cambodia [RGC] and Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] 
and the PDK and National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] to 
immediately accept my formal and solemn proposal for an 
immediate, complete, and unconditional cease-fire and a 
standstill of all current positions of both sides. 
  2. If this cease-fire proposal is already accepted by the 
RGC and KRAF and the PDK and NADK, I invite the RGC and KRAF and 
the PDK and NADK to immediately send me two generals of the KRAF 
and two other generals of the NADK to form, under my 
chairmanship, a cease-fire observation committee to oversee this 
cease-fire throughout the Cambodian territory. 
  3. The roundtable proposal of which your excellency has 
already been aware for the past few days will be held inside the 
royal palace in Phnom Penh or at the Cambodian palace in 
Pyongyang when the cease-fire throughout Cambodia becomes truly 
effective and concretely secure. 
  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen have 
agreed with and given their full support to this proposal since 
the afternoon of Monday, 2 May 1994. Presently, I am confident 
that your excellency will make your answer to my above proposal 
known to me. 
  Affectionately yours, 
  [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk

  [Text] Phnom Penh, May 4 (AFP) -- Cambodia's Khmer Rouge 
[KR] guerrillas said Wednesday that they would accept a 
ceasefire proposed by the king, but called previous ceasefire 
proposals "poisonous tricks" aimed at destroying them. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk, speaking to an audience of monks at 
the Royal Palace, said he had received the long letter from 
Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan which criticized 
previous ceasefire calls while at the same time saying the king 
had a good idea. 
  "He did not say clearly whether or not he supports my 
proposal," King Sihanouk complained. 
  The letter released here said the king's proposal was a good 
one and that the Khmer Rouge fully support it. But it warned 
that the previous ceasefires proposed by the Cambodian 
government as a precondition for peace talks are "poisonous 
tricks they used repeatedly" to get the guerrillas to stop 
fighting so that government troops could capture more Khmer 
Rouge territory. 
  It also pointed to the failure of the ceasefire dictated by 
the 1991 Paris peace accords, formally ending Cambodia's civil 
war and bringing a UN peacekeeping operation to Cambodia to 
maintain the peace. 
  The United Nations blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the 
ceasefire violations during its 18-month mandate in Cambodia. 
The war, still continuing primarily in the northwest, has caused 
60,000 refugees to flee their homes. 
  "Phnom Penh is a place in the hands of the Vietnamese 
communists, the entente, the Vietnamese puppets and the 
two-headed (Cambodian) government, all of whom have a policy to 
destroy (us) permanently," Khieu Samphan wrote. 
  "Therefore, a ceasefire or a non-ceasefire depends on the 
situation," he said. 
  "The Vietnamese communists do not need a ceasefire, do not 
need national reconciliation, unity and peace." 
  Khieu Samphan said he hoped peace talks also proposed by the 
king could be organized abroad as soon as possible. The 
Cambodian government has agreed to go to North Korea for the 
talks, but only if the ceasefire is complete. 
  The Khmer Rouge maintain that Cambodia remains occupied by 
the Vietnamese, who invaded to oust the Khmer Rouge regime in 
1978 and ruled Phnom Penh for a decade.

<F P=106> ["Text" of 3 May Telegram from His Excellency Khieu Samphan, </F>
chairman of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea, to King Norodom 
Sihanouk; place not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] I would like to express my deepest thanks to Your 
Majesty for sending me the message dated 3 May 1994 whose 
significance is as follows: 
  1. Calling for an immediate and unconditional general 
cease-fire in which each side must implement an end to 
activities; 
  2. Calling on the two sides to immediately send two generals 
-- two from each side -- to set up a cease-fire observation 
committee under the chairmanship of Your Majesty; and 
  3. A roundtable meeting will take place in the Royal Palace 
or in the (?Chhang Sun-on) royal residence when the cease-fire 
has been truly and permanently implemented across Cambodia. 
  I would like to be permitted to inform Your Majesty of the 
following: 
  I. I am delighted to abide by Your Majesty's formal and 
solemn proposal for a concrete and permanent cease-fire 
throughout the country because a cease-fire constitutes an 
initial step toward national reconciliation, peace, and genuine 
independence, which represent the desire of Democratic Kampuchea 
as well as the aspiration of the Cambodian nation and every 
Cambodian citizen since long ago. 
  II. I would like to inform Your Majesty that the cease-fire 
should be truly, concretely, and permanently implemented because 
it is the vital need of the entire Cambodian nation and people 
who have suffered for more than 15 years due to the Vietnamese 
war of aggression which continues to this day. 
  III. I would like to inform Your Majesty about the 
cease-fire issue. It is an old problem that has been discussed 
for years. It was raised before the existence of the Paris 
accord and during the Paris conference in 1989. At subsequent 
meetings in other places this matter was also raised. 
Nevertheless, it has never been implemented concretely. This 
has led the general public to believe that it is a maneuver or a 
trick repeatedly employed by the aggressors to serve their 
strategic purpose. For example: 
  A. In December 1978, Pham Van Dong [former Vietnamese prime 
minister] declared to the ASEAN countries that the SRV did not 
need to invade Cambodia. The statement was an answer to 
questions by [word indistinct] ASEAN spokesmen who were anxious 
about Vietnam's preparations to invade Cambodia. Immediately 
afterwards, when Pham Van Dong had not yet even taken a plane to 
return to Hanoi, several hundred thousand Vietnamese troops had 
already invaded Cambodia in an aggressively arrogant and 
insolent manner. 
  B. The 23 October 1991 Paris accord is a tremendous and 
vitally important document that took the world and United 
Nations several months or years to map out. The document has a 
balanced essence that could bring about a cease-fire, national 
reconciliation, and peace in Cambodia. Nonetheless, it has been 
shredded and trampled upon at will. That being the case, peace 
can never be restored in accordance with the accord's essence 
and spirit, and the flames of war have continued. 
  C. After the UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] 
organized elections and the formation of a government with two 
prime ministers, they began to inflame an undeclared war. 
Apparently, they immediately attacked Democratic Kampuchea at 
Phnum Chhat [in Banteay Meanchey Province] and Stoung [in 
Kompong Thom Province] in August (?1993). Between September and 
November 1993, they continued to attack the people and 
Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng without caring in the least 
about peace and national reconciliation, which are profoundly 
desired by our nation and people, and without considering the 
spirit and essence of the Paris accord. In January and February 
1994, they continued to thunderously attack the people and 
Democratic Kampuchea at Anlung Veng. In March and April 1994, 
they continued to attack Pailin and openly declared war with 
Democratic Kampuchea. The two prime ministers of the two-headed 
government and their ministers, deputy ministers, and commanders 
all declared war against Democratic Kampuchea. They said they 
would at all costs destroy Democratic Kampuchea in northern and 
western Cambodia. They do not want national reconciliation and 
they have repeatedly raised their three conditions to destroy 
Democratic Kampuchea. 
  IV. Presently, the situation concerning national and 
social issues and the war situation in Cambodia continually 
being waged by the communist Vietnamese and their puppets and an 
alliance and its cronies are further deteriorated. The problem 
of implanting millions of old and new Vietnamese in Cambodia in 
accordance with the strategic goal of swallowing and turning 
Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kroam has become increasingly 
serious. In fact, Vietnam has already swallowed half of 
Cambodia. As such, it does not need to spit out Cambodia or 
solve problems to achieve national reconciliation, unity, and 
peace in the country. Many social problems have seriously 
worsened and the economy and finance have become paralyzed. The 
subsistence of the two-headed government is supported only by 
communist Vietnamese muscle and force and the alliance's meager 
financial aid. Therefore, a cease-fire or a non- cease-fire 
depends on this situation. It is the communist Vietnamese and 
the alliance who are the masters, not the Cambodians. They do 
not need a cease-fire; do not need national reconciliation, 
national unity, and peace; and do not need to allow Cambodia to 
exist as an independent and neutral country within its 
territorial integrity. 
  Because of these reasons, the cease-fire initiated by the 
two-headed government is not sincere. It is only a poisonous 
trick which they have raised on many occasions previously. 
  V. Regarding the issue of sending two generals to 
participate on the committee for overseeing a concrete, true, 
and permanent cease-fire under His Majesty's august 
chairmanship, I clearly understand that this problem is an 
important matter that needs to be pondered and that military 
personnel from both sides need to be present to achieve good 
results and a definite cease-fire, thereby restoring peace to 
Cambodia. 
  I believe that discussions and negotiations concerning the 
cease-fire, which is an important issue, should take place in a 
safe area. Phnom Penh is in the hands of the communist 
Vietnamese, the alliance, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and 
the two-headed government, all of whom have a policy and 
concrete actions, about which I have already informed Your 
Majesty above, to permanently destroy Democratic Kampuchea. 
  Evidently, on 27 November 1991, when I and H.E. Son Sen 
returned to Phnom Penh to participate in the implementation of 
the Paris accord, since all of us have the goodwill to implement 
the accord correctly, the communist Vietnamese and the alliance 
organized communist Vietnamese commandos and the cat's-paws of 
the Vietnamese puppet State of Cambodia to attack us. They went 
so far as to strike me in the head until it bled. 
  In sum, I understand that His Majesty, with such important 
work in dealing with the destiny of our Cambodian nation and 
motherland, wants negotiations on the cease-fire to be held in a 
safe place inside or outside the country. 
  VI. I, like our entire nation and people, wish to express to 
Your Majesty my total and constant hope that one day a 
roundtable meeting for peace and national reconciliation will 
certainly take place at a neutral site inside or outside the 
country. 
  The information that I have presented to Your Majesty above 
ensues from Democratic Kampuchea's firm and constant stance of 
shouldering the responsibility for the issue of life and death 
of the Cambodian nation and race.

<F P=106> [By E.T. Suarez] </F>
  [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a $1.2-billion 
(about P [Philippine pesos] 33 billion) thermal power plant in 
his home province of Pangasinan capable of supplying 1,320 
megawatts to the Luzon grid. 
  Reported to be the largest base load power station in the 
country, the president said that this power plant will help 
solve the power problem permanently and accelerate economic 
development. 
  The Chief Executive congratulated the Hopewell Group, headed 
by chairman Gordon Wu, for undertaking the $1.2-billion Sual 
project, the biggest under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) 
scheme. 
  The construction of the project is being undertaken by 
Consolidated Electric Power Asia, a subsidiary of the Hopewell 
Group which also undertook the Navotas 1 and 2 Gas Turbine Power 
Station projects and the 775 megawatt Pagbilao Coal-Fired Power 
Station project. 
  The president called on his provincemates to unite and help 
protect the environment, pointing out that the thermal plant to 
be constructed will have a mechanism for environmental 
protection. 
  But aside from electric power, Mr. Ramos stressed that 
people 
power is another factor in the economic development of 
Pangasinan. 
  "Let us help each other because this power plant, when it is 
finished, will not automatically give people power by way of 
jobs and supplemental income and national domestic wealth," he 
said. "We must have to work for that." 
  At a breakfast program at the session hall of the Capitol 
Building in Pangasinan, the president, assisted by Environmental 
and Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala, distributed checks 
totaling P5,053,185 to representatives of families affected by 
the collapse of the tailings dam of Philex Mining in Benguet.

  [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has 
put out an arrest order for breakaway leader Felimon Lagman and 
has fielded an armed unit of the New People's Army [NPA] to take 
him into custody. 
  But Lagman, in a telephone interview with the INQUIRER, said 
his men are ready to kill believed CPP head Jose Ma. Sison in 
Utrecht, The Netherlands, if the party pushes through with its 
arrest order against him. 
  "Come and get me," Lagman said. "Our answer to that is tit 
for tat. Once they formalize the decision to arrest or execute 
me, automatically we will hit Sison in Utrecht. 
  "We will not retaliate against any of Sison's men in the 
Philippines. We will hit the head itself in The Netherlands." 
  In a press statement, the provisional executive committee of 
the Manila-Rizal branch of the CPP said the party has decided to 
place Lagman on trial for various crimes against "the working 
class, the people, and the revolution." 
  The statement described Lagman as a "traitor to the 
revolution." 
  A source in the committee said a team of armed partisans is 
now hunting Lagman, who broke off from Sison's leadership last 
year. 
  Lagman has blamed Sison's leadership for the setbacks 
suffered by the communist movement, including its failure to 
seize the chance to grab power during the EDSA [Epifanio of the 
Saints Avenue] uprising of 1986. 
  "The revolutionary proletariat rejoices at the decision of 
the party to put to trial the traitors to the revolution, 
particularly Felimon Lagman who was responsible for the 
near-fatal annihilation of the labor movement in Metro Manila," 
said the statement. 
  It was signed by one Nova Salvacion, presumably a pseudonym. 
  Salvacion said once arrested, Lagman will be immediately 
tried by a people's court where evidence of his alleged crimes 
will be presented. 
  "Metro Manila-Rizal proletarian revolutionaries shall 
furnish 
the people's court the litany of crimes committed by Lagman and 
his clique, and the evidence on hand proving the guilt of those 
heinous offenses," the statement said. 
  "(These) revolutionaries shall be eagerly waiting for the 
outcome of their trial," it added. 
  The CPP's arrest order for Lagman came weeks after the 
killing of Leopoldo "Ka [Comrade] Hector" Mabilangan, one of the 
former leaders of the NPA's Banahaw Command operating in 
Southern Tagalog. 
  Mabilangan had earlier surrendered to the government and 
received a P5 [Philippine pesos] million loan for a cooperative 
he was starting in Sto. [Santo -- Holy] Tomas, Batangas, his 
hometown. 
  The command, through its spokesperson Rogelio "Ka Roger" 
Rosal, has claimed responsibility for the killing of Mabilangan 
in a churchyard in Sto. Tomas. 
  In a statement read over radio station DZRH, Rosal said 
Mabilangan had been executed for various crimes against the 
party and the revolutionary underground, including the abduction 
and killing of fellow rebels. 
  The killing of Mabilangan deepened the rift between opposing 
factions in the CPP. 
  During Labor Day rallies yesterday, the rift was highlighted 
by the holding of separate rallies by groups loyal to Sison and 
those who have broken off from his leadership. 
  The pro-Sison group held its rally at the Liwasang Bonifacio 
while members of the breakaway group, which had allied with the 
Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, converged at the Luneta 
Grandstand. 
  Sison, in an earlier telephone interview with station DZMM 
from his base in Utrecht, said Lagman, former NPA leader Romulo 
Kintanar, former CPP-Visayas leader Arturo Tabara, and several 
other breakaway rebel leaders had been plotting to assassinate 
him in collaboration with the military. 
  Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, AFP [Armed Forces of the 
Philippines] 
chief, as well as Lagman and Tabara, has denied Sison's charge. 
  Sison's allies in The Netherlands have asked their local 
comrades to investigate the alleged assassination plot against 
him.

<F P=106> ["Ridiculous and Imprudent Act" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities decided to hold a meeting of the "Unification and 
Security Policy Coordinating Council" on May 6 in order to 
confirm their position that the replacement of the Armistice 
Agreement with a peace agreement which the North proposed to the 
United States must be discussed through direct North-South 
dialogue after the complete settlement of the nuclear issue of 
the North and notify the United States and the United Nations of 
this position. 
  Papers here today brand this as a ridiculous and imprudent 
act. 
  An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says: 
  The replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a 
peace agreement and establishment of a new peace arrangement are 
questions that can be solved only between the DPRK and the 
United States, the parties concerned for the Armistice 
Agreement. The authorities of South Korea, not a signatory to 
the Armistice Agreement, are not qualified or justified for 
poking their nose in it. 
  It is the United States that holds all powers in South Korea 
including the military prerogative. Therefore, the question of 
the replacement of the Armistice Agreement with a peace 
agreement cannot be solved through dialogue with the South 
Korean authorities who are deprived of the military prerogative. 
  The South Korean puppets' opposition to DPRK-USA negotiation 
for peace on the pretext of the "settlement of the nuclear issue 
of the North" and their call for "direct North-South dialogue" 
clearly show that they want neither the settlement of the 
nuclear issue nor the establishment of new peace arrangement. 
  Their ulterior intention is to block the DPRK-USA 
negotiation 
for peace arrangement at any cost. 
  If the South Korean authorities want peace, they must not 
obstruct the DPRK-USA negotiation for the establishment of a new 
peace arrangement. 
  An analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that if the South Korean 
puppets continue to resort to despicable acts to prevent the 
realisation of the just proposal of the North, they will 
encounter bitterer criticism and rejection from the people at 
home and abroad.

fighter bombers, FA-18 pursuit-assault planes and warplanes of 
other types and warplanes of the U.S. Airforce in South Korea 
and the puppet Airforce, over 450 in all, staged a military

Military Demarcation Line on May 3, according to military 
sources. 
  Meanwhile, tanks of the South Korean puppet Army deployed in 
Kumpa-ri, Paju County, fired about 20 shells at Hapo-ri of the 
same county and large-calibre gun units that had taken position 
in Mago-ri of Yonchon County, Yongsan-ri of Paju County, and 
Yulli-ri of Chorwon County of South Korean Kangwon Province 
fired some 70 shells into the area adjacent to the Demilitarized 
Zone. 
  The war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets getting more wanton prove that they are rushing toward 
confrontation and war, going against peace and detente in Korea.

by means of pressure", said the defence minister of Malaysia at 
a press conference. 
  "Malaysia," he went on, "considers that the countries 
concerned should show reason in settling the problem of the 
Korean peninsula and not cause a war. If any party resorts to a 
means of high pressure, a war would break out in that region and 
it would affect the security of the Asia-Pacific region." 
  "Malaysia hopes the countries concerned sit at a negotiating 
table and resolve this issue in a peaceful way and opposes any 
country building up nuclear weapons or increasing nuclear 
capacity," he said.

<F P=106> ["Hanminjon on Development of Fast Breeder Reactor in S. </F>
Korea"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of 
the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published 
a white paper on May 2 denouncing the South Korean puppet clique 
for stepping up nuclear armament through the development of the 
fast breeder reactor, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice 
of National Salvation. 
  The South Korean rulers' design to develop the fast breeder 
reactor began in the `80s and they started the development of a 
prototype reactor in cooperation with Japan at the beginning of 
the `90s, the white paper said, and continued: 
  The "government" authorities signed an agreement on 
cooperation in the field of atomic energy with Japan on May 25, 
1990, and agreed with it to "promote the exchange and joint 
study of atomic technologies." It discussed with Japan "the 
joint promotion of the development of technologies of the 
next-generation atomic reactor" at the "South Korea-Japan 
consultative meeting on atomic energy" held on November 9, 1990. 
  At the tete-a-tete between Kim Yong-sam and Morihiro 
Hosokawa 
in Kyongju on November 6, 1993, they agreed in secrecy to 
proceed with the joint development of nuclear weapons on 
condition that South Korea makes a clean sheet of Japan's past 
crimes. 
  The "government" authorities decided to invest about 2,000 
billion won in the researches and development of atomic energy 
including the development of the fast breeder reactor and began 
developing a prototype reactor in 1992. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now running about to get 
the international community to recognize the "legality" of the 
development of the fast breeder reactor. They hosted an 
"international symposium on the reactors of next generation" in 
October 1993, in Seoul at which they wrested a promise from 
some officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency to 
"cooperate in the development of the next-generation reactor in 
South Korea." 
  Noting that the development of the fast breeder reactor 
accelerated by South Korea with desperate efforts together with 
Japan, though its economic advantage and stability are not 
guaranteed in the world, is motivated by their design of nuclear 
arms development, the white paper explained the following 
reasons: 
  Firstly, the development of the fast breeder reactor makes 
it 
possible to breed large quantities of plutonium necessary for 
nuclear bombs. 
  Secondly, it offers a ground for justifying the purchase of 
plutonium from other countries. 
  Thirdly, the fast breeder reactor must be accompanied by 
reprocessing facilities. This fully explains why the Kim 
Yong-sam group is trying so desperately to possess reprocessing 
facilities through the development of the fast breeder reactor. 
  Fourthly, the development of the fast breeder reactor itself 
is a process of nuclear bomb development. The designing of the 
fast breeder reactor is identical with that of nuclear bombs 
from the technical point of view. 
  This stark fact clearly proves that it is none other than 
the 
South Korean ruling group of traitors that reduced to a piece of 
waste paper long ago the joint declaration on denuclearization 
agreed on between the North and the South and have been hell 
bent on nuclear arms development on the Korean peninsula. 
  The white paper demanded that the South Korean authorities 
eliminate the pressurized heavy water reactor and the 
multi-purpose research reactor and, at the same time, promptly 
stop the development of the fast breeder reactor and that the 
international reactionary forces including Japan discontinue 
working hand in glove with the Kim Yong-sam group in the 
development of the fast breeder reactor directly linked to the 
production of nuclear bombs. 
  It expressed the hope that the unbiased opinion of the world 
will persistently keep tabs on the development of the fast 
breeder reactor and nuclear weapons by the South Korean rulers 
and invigorate the activities for checking it.

<F P=106> ["Checking and Frustrating South Korean Puppets' Moves To </F>
Develop Nuclear Weapons Called For" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Presidium member Chong 
Tu-hwan of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the 
Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] released a press 
statement Wednesday in connection with the fact that the South 
Korean puppets' moves for the development of nuclear weapons 
have reached a dangerous stage. He branded the Kim Yong-sam 
group's moves for the development of nuclear weapons as a gross 
violation of the joint declaration on denuclearisation between 
the North and South, a perfidy and treachery to the nation and a 
heinous challenge to the DPRK's efforts for denuclearisation and 
peace. 
  Recalling the fact that the Wolsong heavy water reactor 
alone 
has produced as much spent nuclear fuel containing plutonium as 
is capable of manufacturing some 370 nuclear shells, he 
continues: 
  "The Kim Yong-sam group is putting spurs to the development 
of nuclear weapons of late. It proves that they have neither 
the idea to take hands with the fellow countrymen, nor the will 
to solve the reunification question of the country in a peaceful 
way. The Kim Yong-sam clique is undisguisedly scheming to 
nullify the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation, 
openly talking about the `right to possess nuclear weapons.' 
This is motivated by their sinister scheme to justify and 
legalize their development of nuclear weapons. If their moves 
to develop nuclear weapons are not held in check, the whole 
nation cannot escape a nuclear holocaust to be entailed 
therefrom. All people who are concerned about the future 
destiny of the country and the nation, if only a little, must 
turn out in the struggle to check and frustrate the puppets' 
moves to develop nuclear weapons and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam 
group, irrespective of party affiliation, political view and ism 
and ideology. "The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately stop 
developing nuclear weapons to destroy the nation and at once 
step down as unanimously demanded by the South Korean people."

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Over 2,000 students of 40 
universities and colleges in Seoul including Seoul National 
University, Yonsei University and Korea University had the 
inaugural ceremony of the seventh-term Seoul District Federation 
of General Student Councils (Sochongnyon) at Hongik University 
on May 4 and staged a demonstration calling for an objection to 
treacherous rice market opening and U.S. troops' withdrawal, 
according to a radio report from Seoul. 
  They said that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique yielded to the 
U.S. pressure to open market so the lives of 10 million peasants 
and even workers are being threatened. 
  The students charged that the United States continues to 
threaten the North with a nuclear war and increase the war 
atmosphere on the Korean peninsula. They demanded that 
authorities refuse a "ratification of the final act of the 
Uruguay Round of world trade talks at the National Assembly," 
object to rice import liberalization and realise the U.S. 
troops' pullout and denuclearisation and disarmament and signing 
of peace agreement.

<F P=106> ["Shameless Talk About 'Patriotism'" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyonyang, May 4 (KCNA) - The traitor Kim Yong-sam 
showed up at the Hyonchung shrine [shrine to General Yi Sun-sin] 
in Asan, South Chungchong Province, South Korea, some time ago 
and talked as if he were practising something, succeeding to the 
"patriotism" and "self-sacrificing spirit" of Yi Sun-sin, a 
famous general who performed feats in repulsing Japanese 
aggression at the end of the 16th century. 
  NODONG SINMUN today brands his mishmash as an intolerable 
insult to and a mockery of the patriotic spirit of the 
forerunners. 
  The news analyst says: 
  For his treacherous crimes, the traitor Kim Yong-sam has 
long 
since been disqualified from visiting the Hyonchung shrine or 
talking about Yi Sun-sin's patriotism and self-sacrificing 
spirit. 
  The crimes committed by the traitor against the people, the 
country and the nation over the last one year or more since his 
inauguration are beyond description and are indelible any time. 
Although he talked about some forthcoming "changes" what he will 
bring about is nothing but national disaster such as deepening 
of dependence on the United States and Japan and nuclear scourge. 
  Patriotism and treachery are incompatible. 
  Although Kim Yong-sam tries to lull the growing complaints 
of 
the South Korean people against the "civilian" rule with the 
mask of "patriotism" it is a mistake. 
  The South Korean people will never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
clique which is engaged in treacheries while indiscreetly 
insulting the patriotic spirit of the forerunners.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Hwa-sim who is the 
daughter of the unconverted long-term prisoner, Kim In-so, sent 
letters to various organisations of South Korea and her father 
on May 4. 
  She is a university teacher in Pyongyang. 
  In her letter to the headquarters for the promotion of the 
repatriation of old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights 
Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar 
Association for Democratic Society and the Family Movement for 
Realizing Democracy in South Korea, she appealed to them to 
cooperate in the return of her father to the North. She said 
her father should have been returned to the North at the time of 
the repatriation of POWs according to the international law on 
POWs because [words indistinct] while active as a guerrilla, his 
route blocked in the strategic retreat, after going to the South 
Korean area during the war. 
  "The South Korean authorities kept my father behind bars for 
33 years and seven months for he refused ideological 
conversion," the letter noted, and stated: "This is a very wrong 
act ignoring the international law and the humanitarian idea of 
the Red Cross." 
  She went on: 
  "That my father who is a POW should be returned to the North 
where his children live at an early date unhindered by any 
condition and reason, is a unanimous call of the entire fellow 
countrymen and the conscience of mankind. 
  "I earnestly request once again your organisations which are 
engaged in righteous activities in South Korea for national 
reconciliation and unity, democratisation of society and 
national reunification to continue to show deep concern for the 
misfortune of my family and make persistent efforts for an early 
repatriation of my father." 
  Kim Hwa-sim in the letter to her father said the DPRK Red 
Cross Society urged the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham 
Se-hwan last year and on April 19 this year, but the South side 
is taking an unjust attitude toward it. "This is an act ignoring 
the international law on the POWs," she said. 
  Recalling that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il recently 
expressed concern over the fate of the unconverted long-term 
prisoners in South Korea and said they should be brought back to 
the homeland, the letter expressed the firm belief that her 
father would come back to the hometown, removing obstacles lying 
in his path to the North, just as he won the struggle for 
justice for 40 years.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- Ham Sok-yo, who lives in 
Ongjin County, South Hwanghae Province, sent letters to various 
organisations of South Korea and her brother Ham Se-hwan, who 
refused to be converted despite his long prison life, with 
regard to his repatriation to the North. 
  In a letter dated May 4 to the headquarters for the 
promotion 
of the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners Kim In-so 
and Ham Se-hwan to the North, the Human Rights Committee of the 
National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar Association for 
Democratic Society and the Family Movement for Realizing 
Democracy in South Korea, she said she believed no one would 
dare block her brother's return home because these organisations 
are making much effort for his repatriation and the 
international law provides for the return of prisoners of war, 
though the South Korean authorities take issue with his 
guerrilla activities and "acquirement of (South Korean) 
nationality" [word indistinct] fetched way. 
  She denounced the rude behavior of the South Korean 
authorities in refusing to comply with the just demand of the 
Red Cross Society of the North for the return of Ham Se-hwan who 
was taken prisoner while in action during the last Korean war. 
  She continued: 
  "My brother is not willing to live in the South and cannot 
live there. 
  "He has not abandoned his principle despite all manner of 
persecution and has asked South Korean and international Red 
Cross organisations to help him return to the Northern half of 
the country. This is because my brother Ham Se-hwan is 
earnestly hoping to come back to the homeland where his family 
and relatives including me, his sister, live. 
  "I wish I could see once the face of my youngest brother, 
whom I raised on my back, before I leave this world. Please 
understand the anxious feelings of me, an old woman above 80 who 
is eagerly waiting for her brother to return home." 
  In a letter dated April 25 to her brother, she informed him 
of her happy life in her eighties, without any inconvenience 
under the care of the country as well as of the lives of the 
relatives. 
  She denounced the South Korean authorities for subjecting 
her 
brother to 34 years of imprisonment and all sorts of sufferings 
in a place away from home, without kith and kin for the mere 
reason that he refused to be converted ideologically. 
  She said: 
  "The day will surely come when we brother and sister will 
meet because efforts are being made here and in the South by 
kind-hearted people for your repatriation. 
  "I ask you to actively fight in order to return to the DPRK 
at an early date."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The Zimbabwean 
Committee for the Repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan to 
the North was inaugurated in Harare on April 20. 
  Parliamentarian J. Macheka, secretary of the Zimbabwe-Korea 
Solidarity and Friendship Association, was elected chairman of 
the committee at the meeting. 
  A letter of protest to the South Korean puppet authorities 
was released at the meeting, which denounced their brutalities 
in invaliding Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, former soldiers of the 
Korean People's Army, by tortures and inhumane maltreatment, 
keeping them in prison for tens of years for refusing to be 
converted, and strongly demanded that they be immediately 
returned to the northern half of Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- A South Korean 
compatriot, Kim Chae-su, 34, came over to the North through a 
third country with his wife Min Chong-cha, 34, and his son Kim 
Un-chol, 11. 
  Born in Chunchon, South Korean Kangwon Province, he finished 
primary and middle schools and graduated from a high school 
before serving in the puppet Army for three years. 
  He worked at an aviation company and engaged in other jobs 
from 1981 and kept an aquatic products shop in his hometown 
before defecting to the North. 
  Now his parents and brothers live in South Korea. 
  Explaining the motive of his defection, Kim Chae-su said he 
learned through various channels that the people in the North 
were equally well off under a good policy centered on the 
masses. "Hearing this, I was disillusioned about the South 
Korean society where fraud, swindle and irregularities hold sway 
and I did not want to live there any longer." 
  "Clearly learning that the anti-communist propaganda of the 
South Korean authorities was all a lie, I firmly resolved to 
come to the North where the people live a worthy life," he said, 
and added: "I came over here while I was on a foreign trip with 
my family under the disguise of tourism."

  [Text] Tokyo, May 2 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- Public 
figures of Japan denounced most brutal crackdown on the Osaka 
prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon [General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan] and its branches by the Japanese 
police. 
  A member of the House of Councillors, Hideo Den, said that 
the police suppression of Koreans in Japan is creating an 
anti-DPRK atmosphere under the pretext of "nuclear suspicion 
against the North" faked up by the United States. "The Japanese 
Government must probe the truth and apologize," he demanded. 
  A lawyer, Shigeru Tokoi, said that the recent search reminds 
one of the crackdown on Koreans in Japan including the 
suppression of national education on the eve of the Korean war. 
  Akira Iwai, chairman of the Japan Committee for Supporting 
the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said he, as 
a Japanese, cannot tolerate the assault on a Korean girl student 
and unreasonable police search of Chongnyon when the DPRK-USA 
talks had collapsed and the Korean situation had become more 
strained. 
  Yasusaburo Hoshino, an honourary professor at Rikkyo 
University, said the recent search was like a rehearsal to 
mobilize the "Self-Defence Forces" in Japan in case a war breaks 
out in the Korean peninsula. He denounced this as an 
unpardonable act to incite the fever of the second Korean war.

at the meeting.

Affairs in Present Era" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Copies of a literature 
titled "General Kim Chong-il Is the Most Outstanding Genius of 
Military Affairs in the Present Era" were recently scattered at 
the barracks and posts of a unit of the South Korean puppet Army 
near the Military Demarcation Line, stirring up the hearts of 
the officers and soldiers, according to Radio Voice of National 
Salvation from Seoul. 
  The literature in the name of the "Patriotic Soldiers 
Committee" said: 
  The secret of the great might of the North which is 
undauntedly standing against the United States styling itself 
"the only superpower" lies in that General Kim Chong-il, the 
greatest general in the world, is wisely leading the Army and 
the people. 
  General Kim Chong-il is the most outstanding genius of 
military affairs in the present era who is possessed of military 
resources of chuche, matchless courage and tested commanding art. 
  Thanks to his military gift, the People's Army could grow up 
to be a-match-for-a-hundred invincible army, a genuine national 
army capable of repulsing any aggression of outside forces at 
one blow and defending the sovereignty of the nation. 
  It is the great pride and honour of our nation to have such 
a 
genuine national army as the people's Army. If we are to be a 
true national army, we must be led by General Kim Chong-il, 
Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army. 
  The "ROK" Army soldiers should know that to turn the guns at 
the U.S. aggressors and their stooges with a bold decision is a 
patriotic action to become a genuine national army defending the 
sovereignty of the nation and to live up to the intention of 
General Kim Chong-il, the outstanding genius of military affairs 
produced by our nation.

<F P=106> ["Famous Work Demonstrating Invincibility of Korean-Style </F>
Socialism"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates a signed article to the 3rd anniversary of the 
publication of "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not 
Perish", a famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
(May 5, 1991). 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work formulated the basic 
characteristics of the Korean-style socialism centred on the 
masses and its superiority, and the source of its durability and 
invincibility with perfect logic and crystal propositions and 
gave a comprehensive exposition of all the theoretical and 
practical questions arising in building true socialism centred 
on the masses. 
  The article headlined "Famous Work Demonstrating 
Invincibility of Korean-Style Socialism" says that for their 
richness, profundity, truth, originality, scientific and 
revolutionary character the ideologies and theories expounded in 
the work gave the faith in certain victory to the people in our 
era who are struggling to achieve the victory of the cause of 
socialism and are a precious textbook of struggle and life for 
the revolutionary people. 
  The article says Korean-style socialism centred on the 
masses 
is invincible socialism because it applies the great chuche idea 
and provides the masses with an independent and creative life. 
  It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying: 
  "Because it is the embodiment of the chuche idea, our 
socialism is a man-centred socialism under which man is the 
master of everything and everything serves him." 
  The article further says: 
  The basic characteristics and essential advantages of 
our-style socialism lie in basing on the chuche idea calling for 
thinking everything centering on the people and for making 
everything serve them. 
  Today our socialism is victoriously advancing unshaken by 
any 
vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries because 
it is based on and guided by the chuche idea. 
  Socialism is the life and soul of our people whereas the 
chuche idea is the life and soul of our socialism. The might of 
our socialism is that of the great chuche idea and as there is 
the chuche idea, no force can break our socialism. 
  In our country the popular masses are taking part in the 
political life as masters of the state and society and leading 
an active and creative life as masters of economic life. 
  Our socialism is indestructible socialism next because the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses has 
been successfully realized. 
  The work consummates the questions arising in strengthening 
the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses 
which is the eternal vitality of our socialism. 
  The party and the leader believe and boundlessly love the 
people and the people absolutely trust and uphold the party and 
the leader -- this is the true feature of our singlehearted 
unity. 
  No force can break the might of our socialism in which the 
leader, the party and the masses are united singleheartedly. 
Our people will smash the anti-socialist moves of the 
imperialists and reactionaries and certainly achieve the final 
victory of the socialist cause in reliance on the might of the 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 3 May article: "The Ideological Position of </F>
Our Socialism Is Impregnable"] 
  [Text] The genuine value and historic significance of 
great events or achievements are to further effloresce with the 
lapse of time. Twenty years have passed since the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il published the historic 7 May document 
following the publication of the program of modeling the whole 
society after the chuche idea. 
  In this period, during which a glorious and brilliant era 
was 
unfolded in the accomplishment of the chuche cause, changes of 
which we can be proud of with dignity have been effected and 
abundant fruit has been produced in socialist press construction. 
  The press plays a great role in the development of society 
and in the struggle for the revolution. In the war of 
confrontation without sounds of guns between socialism and 
capitalism in today's international arena the ideological war, 
the war of the press, has formed a most acute and fierce 
struggle front. 
  Destroying the imperialists' reactionary ideological and 
press offensives and firmly defending the ideological position 
of socialism is a serious problem related to the destiny of 
socialism. Socialism, ever since its beginning, has pioneered 
its road and has been victorious amid the struggle against 
capitalism and reactionary ideological trends. The imperialists' 
slandering and false propaganda against socialism and their 
reactionary ideological and cultural offensives against it have 
become more cunning and vicious with each passing day. 
  What should we do in order to check all sorts of reactionary 
sophistries and corrupt and bourgeois ideology and press and, 
thus, to firmly lead socialist press construction to the road of 
victory? The press of our times and the socialist cause are 
faced with this historic question today. 
  Let us listen to the voices ringing from chuche Korea for a 
while. Ideology is life in socialist society. Attach great 
importance to pen and microphone. Reporters and journalists are 
vanguard standard bearers who are standing at the first line of 
the party's ideological front. 
  When and where has this resolute and revolutionary voice 
ever 
rung nobly in the history of socialist press construction? This 
voice with regard to the important mission of the socialist 
press and the vanguard roles of reporters and men of the press 
is a solemn declaration that can be rung only in the country 
upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja]. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the prominent, great 
man [kolchurhan wiin] who has unfolded the great golden age of 
the socialist press on this land. This is the dignified shouts 
of Korean reporters and men of the press who are conducting 
publication and press activities, upholding the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-chol as the master of the press. 
  The new golden age of the socialist press construction in 
our 
country was unfolded by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. In 
the middle of the 1970's when our party and the revolution 
entered an era of great change again the dear comrade leader, 
who had brilliantly inherited the tradition of publication and 
press created by the great leader and wisely led publication and 
press work, published the 7 May document, the immortal work, and 
ignited the flames of the newspaper revolution, the press 
revolution, and the publication revolution. This was an occasion 
of revolutionary changes that opened up a bright vista for 
socialist press construction. 
  Recorded in every page of the 20-year-long history in which 
our Korean reporters and men of the press have carried out the 
newspaper revolution, the press revolution, and the publication 
revolution along the road elucidated by the 7 May document is 
the truth that only when one upholds the great leader [widaehan 
yongdoja] can one brilliantly realize the cause of socialist 
press construction. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great ideologist 
and theorist who has brilliantly elucidated the ideology of 
socialist press construction. The chuche-oriented publication 
and press ideology was created by the great leader and has been 
brilliantly embodied by him. 
  The dear comrade leader inherited the tradition of the 
revolutionary publications such as SAENAL, VOLSHEVIK, [word 
indistinct] WOLGAN, and SOGWANG founded by the great leader in 
his anti-Japanese struggle period and has resolutely safeguarded 
and defended the tradition and given sagacious explanations to 
the new ideological and theoretical problems arising in the 
practice of the press of our times. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Our 
party's publications, communications, and broadcasts have 
inherited the brilliant revolutionary tradition created by the 
great leader. They take the leader's chuche-oriented publication 
and press ideology as its only guiding principle. They also take 
it as their lofty purpose to consummate to the end the glorious 
revolutionary cause pioneered by the leader [suryong] generation 
after generation. 
  The 7 May document, which our reporters and journalists 
always and kindly call and regard as a guideline, is a powerful 
ideological weapon [sasangjok mugi] that makes it possible for 
our media to actively contribute to modelling the whole society 
on the chuche idea. 
  In the 7 May document, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
has defined the character and basic mission of our party's 
media. He has maintained that the basic principle of the press 
and publication activity is to strongly establish the party's 
monolithic leading system by regarding the chuche principle as a 
cornerstone of the party's media and to vigorously carry out the 
speed battle by making a good choice of cores in literary works. 
Also, he has fully solved all problems arising in effecting a 
revolutionary upsurge in press and publication propaganda by 
bringing about a revolutionary change in the areas of the 
newspaper [sinmun], press [podo], and publications [chulpan]. 
  All these ideologies, theories, and policies expounded in 
the 
7 May document have been a valuable press program that opened 
the golden age of the socialist press today. The dear comrade 
leader's press ideology fully expounded in his many works, 
including the historic 7 May document, has an originality based 
on his profound speculation and new discoveries [saeroun 
palgyon]. He has not regarded old practices and experience as 
absolute but rather has creatively solved new problems arising 
in socialist press construction in conformity with the demands 
of the current times, the developing revolution, and the rapidly 
changing situations. 
  The dear comrade leader's press ideology is a weapon of 
omnipotence, as well as an encyclopedia, enabling us to fully 
solve all problems in the press and publication activity. He is 
well-versed in all the sectors and units of the press and 
publication works, including newspapers, communication 
[tongsin], broadcasting [pangsong], books, magazines, and 
photos, and, also, has more profound knowledge of them. 
  Ranging from the general direction and basic mission of the 
press and publication work to the characteristics of all kinds 
of articles -- including editorials, special articles, political 
essays, and news reports -- the method of writings, and the 
method of editors' and reporters' activities, everything has 
been expounded in the dear comrade leader's press ideologies and 
policies. 
  The dear comrade leader has talked on many occasions about 
the press and publication works and has clearly solved all 
problems in a timely manner. Whenever we receive teachings from 
the dear comrade leader, we cannot but truly express our 
admiration for his keen wisdom and multisided talents. Even 
functionaries -- who contribute their whole life to the press 
and publication works -- esteem and respect him as the great 
master [kojang] of the press, thus expressing their admiration 
for him. 
  The dear comrade leader's press ideology is based on the 
chuche idea and, also, its kernel is a revolutionary outlook on 
the leader [suryong]. Therefore, in the 7 May document, the 
dear comrade leader has defined the character of our party's 
media in relation to the great leader's [suryong] esteemed name 
and has enabled our media, communication, and broadcasting to 
always and mainly propagate the greatness of the leader 
[suryong]. 
  In the world there is no other media except our party's 
media 
-- which regards the dear comrade leader's press ideology as a 
guideline -- that gives the greatest reverence and loyalty to 
the leader [suryong] when it reports, even one time, on his 
picture or revolutionary activity, overflowing with his idea. 
  Truly, the dear comrade leader's press ideology -- which is 
the highest peak [choegobong] in the socialist ruling party's 
press ideology -- is a leading guideline that enabled our 
party's media to be established, strengthened, and developed 
based on the most correct way without the slightest deviation 
and vicissitudes, as well as an invincible and ideological 
weapon that has been monolithically systemized in a great press 
practice [oron silchon]. The might of his press ideology has 
been fully proved as well. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the great leader 
[yongdoja] who is victoriously leading the press and publication 
work to embody the chuche press ideology with his seasoned 
organizational power and his energetic activities. The history 
of 20 years -- since the 7 May document was published -- has 
been brilliantly recorded by the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's practical activity that has outstandingly effected a 
great innovation in all the press and publication sectors, along 
with the ideological and theoretical activity in which he has 
fully elucidated the socialist press ideology. 
  Ranging from the revolution, construction, social 
development 
to the struggles against (? enemies) and the concrete conditions 
of life, all the sectors and units have been affected by the 
press. The leadership on the press is the most sensitive and 
creative activity that must deal with, by the minute, a great 
number of the complicated and sharp problems arising in the 
country, as well as abroad. 
  The energetic activity and work of the dear comrade 
leader--who correctly settles all problems in a timely manner, 
personally shouldering all heavy responsibilities arising in the 
practice of the press despite his busy work in leading party 
work, state work, military work, and external work--are indeed 
astonishingly vast. 
  The high-toned voices which rang in the site of the seventh 
meeting of the Korean Journalist Union held last year are still 
vivid in people's minds. The voices stated: The dear comrade 
leader is the genius of newspaper and press information. The 
dear comrade leader is the commander of the war of 
communications and radio waves who makes the chuche-oriented 
radio waves sweep all over the world. The dear comrade leader is 
the prominent leader who has elucidated the lifeline of the 
chuche-oriented broadcast work. 
  The voices of participants and debaters in the meeting were 
the dignified shouts of their boundless fortune of upholding the 
dear leader as the great lodestar of the press whom mankind has 
ever met. They were also an expression of the infinite praise of 
his energetic activity as the great press activist who wisely 
leads the work of newspaper, communications, broadcast, and 
publication organs. 
  The dear comrade leader gives precious ideological and 
theoretical provisions which form the contents of our 
publications and press information and solves all important 
policies arising in press and publication work. He often 
personally checks the main subject and theme of articles. He 
reviews reporters' poorly written manuscripts and personally 
corrects and completes them. When he finds materials on laudable 
communist virtues, which are efflorescing throughout the country 
today, he sends them to the press organs in order to see to it 
that they are propagated and generalized among the people. 
  Articles and editorials, including special articles and 
political essays, which have moved the hearts of millions of 
readers and made a big sensation in the world thanks to such 
guidance of the dear leader, are countless. The dear comrade 
leader has seen to it that the immortal works that he personally 
wrote are published in NODONG SINMUN, which is the party's 
newspaper, and KULLOJA so that our press and publications will 
not only widely propagate the party's ideology and position 
internally and externally, but also enhance by all means the 
party's prestige and influence. 
  The dear comrade leader's energetic leadership in the 
socialist press finds expression in his on-the-spot guidance to 
press and publication organs. 
  On 19 August 1993 cadre functionaries, reporters, and 
editorial staff members of NODONG SINMUN greeted the dear 
comrade leader who arrived at the newspaper company for a visit 
without prior notice. At this time, their joy was indeed 
infinitely great. The dear comrade leader looked around modern 
editing process facilities for a long while and gave guidance to 
functionaries of NODONG SINMUN, the party's newspaper. The dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who had ignited the flames of the 
editorial revolution in the party's newspaper and energetically 
led the editorial revolution, brilliantly elucidated the road on 
which NODONG SINMUN can outstandingly perform its mission and 
duty as the authoritative party's newspaper of the Workers' 
Party of Korea and indicated: To safeguard and defend our 
country's socialism and to consummate the socialist cause under 
the complicated and tense situation it is imperative to more 
firmly rally party members and the working people around the 
party and to vigorously accelerate socialist construction. The 
party's newspaper occupies a very important position in this. 
  Overflowing in his remarks--which were full of infinite 
energy and vigor--were the sharp and thorough analysis of the 
prevailing domestic and international situation, the iron-like 
will to resolutely defend the socialist cause, and the matchless 
courage to sternly smash the enemies' vicious, reactionary 
ideological offensives by firmly arming and uniting all of the 
people ideologically. 
  History has shown that the imperialists and reactionaries 
perpetrate all sorts of frantical maneuvers at home and abroad 
to aim at the party's newspaper first and to degenerate it in 
order to destroy the party and the socialist system and to 
disarm the people ideologically. If the party's newspaper shakes 
and changes in quality the press circles are reduced into yellow 
and gray, all sorts of reactionary ideologies are infiltrated, 
and eventually a tragic event of swallowing the gains of the 
revolution attained in blood is created. This is a bitter 
lesson shown by the realities of those countries in which 
socialism has collapsed. 
  On that historic day, the dear comrade leader made 
programmatic remarks on needs for the party's newspaper to give 
priority to indoctrination and strongly arm the party members 
and workers with the party's idea, the socialist idea, in 
compliance with the changing environment, correctly handle 
various editing materials, carry articles that arouse curiosity 
among readers, enhance roles of reporters and editors, and 
further modernize the newspaper company's operation. He also 
taught a need to give spiritual nutrition [chongsinjok yangsik] 
to coal miners working in underground deadends and fighters 
waging struggles under difficult environments to ensure that 
they maintain their belief and fidelity. 
  The dear comrade leader's words gave all officials, 
reporters, and editors of the party's newspaper the belief and 
will that they will share the same destiny with their party and 
socialism no matter how many times the world may turn upside 
down. 
  He, feeling sorry to part with journalists-fighters [munpil 
chonsa] whom he personally raised, stopped his limousine and 
left the compound of the party's newspaper after waving his 
hands to their enthusiastic applause. 
  He kindled flames to further strengthen the party's 
newspaper 
and score revolutionary upsurges in the overall publication and 
press work in compliance with the demand of the new environment 
in which our party and the party's newspaper had the heavy 
historic mission of defending and advancing the socialist cause. 
Therefore, the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot guidance to 
the NODONG SINMUN company will be of greater historic 
significance as time goes by. 
  In the vortex of the ever-changing situation, the war of 
communications and electronic waves [tongsin chonpajon], as well 
as newspapers and broadcasting stations, plays a very important 
role in the press war [ollonjon] to defeat the imperialists' 
reactionary ideological and cultural offensives. 
  The footsteps of the dear comrade leader's on-the-spot 
guidance can also be traced to the Korean Central News Agency 
[KCNA] company. On 5 October 1980, a few days before the 
historic sixth party Central Committee congress, the dear 
comrade leader visited the KCNA company though he was very busy. 
It was very surprising. He elucidated the path which the news 
agency should take and took all necessary measures to ensure 
utmost promptness and correctness in the coverage of the party 
congress. He stayed with the reporters and editors of the news 
agency for a long time that day. 
  All people were filled with great joy and deep emotion when 
they saw the sacred image [korukhan yongsang] of the dear 
comrade leader, who appeared at the podium of the historic party 
congress a few days later, in newspapers and on television. At 
the time when every minute and second of his was very valuable 
because he was in charge of the important work of successfully 
holding the party congress, he examined each and every task of 
the news agency even on the podium of the congress and promptly 
resolved each task. No other party leader [yongdoja] in the 
world has done his utmost to carry out the press work. 
  He sometimes gives teachings on several occasions a day. 
Because of his prudent guidance, KCNA fulfills its mission as 
an important ideological weapon that deals a strong blow to all 
reactionary ideas and utter trash that haunt the space on 
diverse frequencies and waves and that makes our party's 
independent positions and just voices resound throughout the 
world. 
  Throughout the days when he made the publication and press 
work lead the party's ideological front and made every effort to 
strengthen and develop this work, he spent numerous nights to 
review articles and editing materials for newspapers, the news 
agency, and publications and strove to develop the publication 
and press work. He even made these such efforts to develop the 
work of publication and the press alone. Therefore, he surely 
has no time to take a rest because he is personally in charge of 
party and state affairs, military affairs, and the grand 
historic task of winning victories in the Korean revolution and 
mankind's cause of independence. 
  The new era of chuche-oriented television broadcasting 
opened 
because of these sleepless and tireless efforts by the dear 
comrade leader. The dear comrade leader earlier proposed 
starting television broadcasting and energetically led the work 
of implementing this initiative. The first chuche-oriented 
television broadcasting started in our country because of his 
careful and energetic leadership, and the work of spreading the 
television network across the country was carried out 
successfully. 
  Each segment of television programs boundlessly ennobles 
and enriches the ideological and spiritual lives and cultural 
and emotional lives of all party members and workers and is 
filled with the dear comrade leader's intention and concrete 
guidance to highly display the superiority of our-style 
socialism. 
  When the party and the revolution were entrusted with heavy 
tasks and when the situation at home and abroad was grave, the 
dear comrade leader paid deep attention to the militant role of 
publications and mass media and led them to launch large-scale 
ideological offensives. In this way, he strongly armed the 
entire party, all the people, and the entire Army with the 
party's ideology and will, consolidated the single-hearted unity 
of our revolutionary ranks, and vigorously inspired all party 
members and workers into carrying out socialist construction, 
the cause of achieving the fatherland's reunification, and the 
cause of achieving independence throughout the world. 
  Even under present circumstances in which the imperialists 
are frantically trying to inspire the people with reactionary 
ideas and spread decadent and corrupt [toepyejogigo 
malsegijogin] (?bourgeois) life-styles, every newspaper, news 
agency, broadcasting station, or book in our country upholds the 
banner of the chuche idea, the socialist banner, without shaking 
and fulfills its heavy mission as an important media 
organization that correctly represents and defends their party's 
ideology and position and propagandizes and implements the 
party's policies. This is unthinkable apart from the dear 
comrade leader's wise leadership. 
  Today, our party's publications and mass media have a 
reputation and a great influence in international journalism 
circles, and the people of the world pay attention to voices 
resounding in Pyongyang. This is a valuable result achieved by 
the tested leadership art and powerful press war tactics 
[yuryokhan ollon chonbop] of the dear comrade leader, who firmly 
adheres to the chuche-oriented position and revolutionary 
principle in the ideological press war [sasang ollonjon] and 
resolves all issues in a matured and sagacious manner. 
  In the history of the working class' prolonged struggle for 
socialism, there are many parties and leaders [yongdojaduri] 
that founded revolutionary publications and media organizations 
and utilized them. However, no other political leaders 
[yongdoja] in the history of the development of the journalism 
of the world and in any party attached greater significance to 
publications and mass media, more positively utilized them, and 
further strengthened their might than our dear comrade leader. 
  The dear comrade leader, a [word indistinct] of the press of 
our era, set a world-class example in the leadership of the 
publications and mass media. Our dear leader General Kim 
Chong-il is a great leader [yongdoja] and a teacher who built a 
large unit of revolutionary journalists who are boundlessly 
loyal to the party and revolution and the fatherland and people. 
  In countries where socialism has collapsed, reporters and 
journalists have changed in ideological terms and degraded in 
moral terms because they had no great leader [yongdoja] at the 
head of their party and eventually turned into trumpeters for 
the enemy's antisocialist maneuvers. At such a time, reporters 
and journalists in Korea have upheld the red banner of the 
revolution and shared the same destiny with the party without 
shaking or changing their minds. 
  The Korean reporters and journalists have been able to take 
the lead in the party's ideological front and excellently 
fulfilled their heavy mission and duty before the era and 
history. This is because they have been indoctrinated and 
raised under the care of great General Kim Chong-il. 
  The relationship between the leader [yongdoja] and 
reporters and journalists in our country is not simply a 
relationship of being led and receiving leadership, but it is 
also formed of a relationship between the great teacher and 
pupil and a benevolent father [chaaeroun opoi] and blood 
children. Here, the blood-tied relationship and an impregnably 
complete unity exists in which there lies the greatest happiness 
and glory of our Korea's reporters and journalists, and the 
invincible might of our press. 
  The dear comrade leader who attaches just as great 
importance 
to the role of the pen and microphone in the revolution and 
construction and social development, as the might of a 
million-strong force, indoctrinated and trained the reporters 
and journalists not just as writers, but as those who love 
justice and truth and as resolute fighters and enthusiastic 
patriots unhesitatingly devoting their lives for the revolution. 
  The revolution of the newspaper, the press, and publications 
which was kindled by him was a glory of ideological training and 
a school of the revolution, fostering our reporters and 
journalists into chuche-type communist revolutionary and 
competent literary fighters. 
  On 6 April 1974, the dear comrade leader highly assessed the 
reporters and made the following impressive talk: Those who 
write in accordance with the party's intention are heroes. 
  Even when the political and ideological level and literary 
skills of the reporters and journalists were in their infant 
stage, Comrade Kim Chong-il, our benevolent teacher, led them 
hand in hand and step by step, thus embracing such valuable 
glory to them. 
  Reporters and journalists have been called comrade and 
eternal companion by their leader [yongdoja] and even received a 
reply letter from the leader [yongdoja] after sending a letter 
containing a do-or-die pledge toward the leader [yongdoja] when 
they were faced with an arduous trial before the revolution. 
Such an impressive fact has not been recorded in the history of 
the development of the press for all ages and countries. 
  The dear comrade leader's high political faith and love 
toward the reporters and journalists are truly endless. Amid 
the bosom of the great father [widaehan opoi], the reporters and 
journalists were rendered distinguished services with gold 
medals and became people's reporters and people's journalists. 
Also, reporters and journalists who performed meritorious deeds 
for a long time received benevolent birthday tables, and bear 
the honor of being laid in the patriotic martyrs tomb after 
their deaths. 
  Korea's reporters and journalists truly cannot live even for 
a minute and cannot elucidate the honor of the party's literary 
fighters apart from the bosom of the great General Kim Chong-il. 
The dear comrade leader exerted such great efforts and energy to 
foster and present the reporters and journalists. Even so, he 
is an endlessly humble and benevolent father who turned all the 
meritorious deeds and glory toward the reporters and journalists. 
  We cannot forget 19 November 1993. On this day, the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent a letter to the participants of 
the seventh congress of the Korean Journalists Union. It was an 
inspiring event in which it manifested to the whole world the 
relationship of complete harmony among the leader [yongdoja], 
reporters, and journalists. 
  In the past, our reporters and journalists were endlessly 
loyal to the party, and today they are unchangeably sharing the 
fate with the party as in the past. Where are such highly proud 
reporters and journalists who are carrying out press and 
publication activities with their pens, microphones, and cameras 
amid the great leader's [yongdoja] great faith and love? 
  Only the chuche-type blood embraced by the party is flowing 
in the bodies of our reporters and journalists who have been 
fostered and trained by enjoying such great glory amid the 
protection of the great leader [yongdoja]. Also, they are 
highly praising only their party and the leader [suryong] and 
are writing and carrying out broadcasts advocating their 
fatherland and system. 
  Our Korea's reporters and journalists have a firm view of 
the 
revolutionary outlook, have a firm stand on socialism, do not 
want any comfort or worldly fame, but are gathering news, 
writing, and carrying out broadcast activities with the spirit 
of a war correspondent. 
  Today, all the People's Army officers and men with rifles 
and the 5 million young vanguards who desire to be guns and 
bombs are firmly united around great General Kim Chong-il. 
Ranks of faithful reporters and journalists who are firmly 
grasping pens of the revolution are also firmly united as one 
around him in strong faith and will. 
  There is no force in the world that can break the rank of 
our 
reporters and journalists who are death-defyingly defending 
their leader [yongdoja] politically, ideologically, and 
theoretically with absolute worship of, loyalty, and filial 
obedience to him. As long as this iron-firm rank exists, our 
party's press and publications will shine forever as the great 
Comrade Kim Chong-il's press and publications. 
  The 20-year history of our party's press and publication 
that 
has advanced along the road elucidated by the historic 7 May 
document! The days of the past 20-year history and the brilliant 
reality of today vigorously demonstrate the justness and might 
of the great comrade leader's original press ideology and the 
greatness of his leadership achievements. 
  As we uphold the great leader [yongdoja] at the top of the 
party, the revolution, and the press, our Korean reporters and 
journalists have indeed been able to walk along the glorious 
road of victory, and our party's press and publications have 
been able to accumulate historic accomplishments that will shine 
forever all over the world. 
  What enables us to look back on the past days, filled with 
dignity and pride? Our party's press and publications, 
reporters, and journalists have the greatest pride and honor in 
the fact that they have actively contributed to the brilliant 
solution of the question on the succession of leadership in 
implementing the socialist cause. 
  Our party's press and publications have firmly defended the 
stronghold [chinji] of the socialist ideology by concentrating 
all efforts on broadly propagating ideologies and theories of 
the dear comrade leader, who is leading the socialist cause 
along the single road of victory, and on firmly guaranteeing his 
leadership through generations. 
  Whether the stronghold the socialist ideology can be 
defended 
or not, greatly depends on the role of the press. The 
degeneration of the press results in the degeneration of 
society. This is why imperialists and reactionaries are trying 
to destroy the party and the socialist system, to degrade the 
people ideologically, and to degenerate the press by all means. 
  All of our newspapers, news agencies, broadcasting services, 
magazines, and books broadly explain and propagate the 
superiority of socialism of our own style that has embodied the 
chuche idea, and they prevent any strange ideology [chapsasang] 
or voice that has no relation to the party's ideology and 
position, the working class-oriented position, or socialist 
principles from infiltrating into our society. 
  In printed columns or on screens, our press and publications 
make features of the dear comrade leader's immortal achievements 
and his greatness as a great ideological theorist, a great 
politician, a great military strategist, and the people's father 
so as to have all people and the People's Army officers and men 
bear deep in their hearts the will and faith that they can 
complete the socialist cause only by following him. 
  Thanks to the great contribution of our party's press and 
publications, our entire party, all people, and entire Army are 
resolutely defending the stronghold [poru] of socialism, united 
as one around great General Kim Chong-il today. 
  The Korean reporters' and journalists' contribution to the 
sublime cause of solving the question on the succession of 
leadership by upholding great General Kim Chong-il -- the 
destiny of socialism -- at the top of the party, the revolution, 
and the Army will shine forever as their greatest exploit that 
they can squarely brag about in the present and before history. 
  As long as the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a great man 
of the socialist press, and the rank of faithful reporters and 
journalists who share their destinies with him exist, our 
party's ideological front, the ideological stronghold of 
socialism, is impregnable forever.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Rice-transplanting has 
begun in the countryside of Korea. 
  Co-operative farmers have brought up sturdy rice seedlings 
despite the unfavorable weather in spring this year. 
  They do farming on a scientific and technical basis as 
required by the chuche method. This year, too, they have 
started rice-transplanting when the right time came. 
  Rice-transplanting, one of the most important farming 
processes, begins in early May and is carried out in 20 odd days 
by intensive efforts.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The transplanting of 
humus-potted maize seedlings began in the Korean countryside. 
  Co-op farmers across the country have grown sturdy maize 
seedlings for reaping a bumper maize harvest again this year. 
  They do farming on a scientific and technical basis on the 
principle of the right crop in the right time and the right crop 
on the right soil. This year, too, they began transplanting 
humus-potted maize seedlings all at once as the right time came. 
  Rural communities now are overfulfilling daily quotas by use 
of various highly-efficient machines including tractors and 
fertilizer-spraying machines. 
  The transplanting of humus-potted maize seedlings is one of 
the important farming processes in Korea.

of the DPRK was awarded and a 60th birthday table granted to Pak 
Hyong-uk, a general of the Hong Song-yul Unit of the Korean 
People's Army.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- The construction of 120 
kilometres long expressway from Pyongyang to Hyangsan where 
scenic Mt. Myohyang is situated, is progressing fast. 
  The expressway will stretch straight from Pyongyang to Anju 
(60 odd kilometres) and then run along the River Chongchon from 
Anju to Hyangsan. 
  The 217 km-long River Chongchon empties into the West Sea 
with its sources in Mt. Nangnim in the northwestern part of the 
country. 
  The name of the river, with picturesque landscape along it, 
was derived from its water as clear as the sky. 
  There are scenic spots on either side of the river such as 
Mt. Myohyang, the Paeknyong cave known as an underground Mt. 
Kumgang, the Yonphung reservoir of superb view and the Paeksang 
pavillion in Anju and Mt. Yaksandongdae in Yongbyon which belong 
to the eight scenic spots in northwestern area of Korea. 
  Mt. Myohyang is one of the five famous mountains of Korea. 
Fascinating is the scenery of the mountain with azelea blooming 
in spring, birds singing in thick verdure in summer and tree 
leaves tinged with red in autumn. 
  The mountain has many peaks including the Piro, Hyangro and 
Popwang peaks and tens of falls such as the Pison, Chonsin and 
Unha falls, and mineral water springs. 
  In the mountain there are the international friendship 
exhibition that preserves gifts sent to the great leader 
President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
from heads of state and progressive people in different 
countries and such historic sites and relics as Pohyon and 
Sangwon temples. 
  Cities, villages, factories, enterprises and fertile fields 
of cooperative farms on the banks of the river add to the beauty 
of the landscape. 
  Anju is a young city rebuilt in the 1970s. Modern high-city 
rise buildings of various styles are standing in rows. On the 
banks of the river there are the gigantic Namhung youth chemical 
complex, the Anju coal complex and the Anju silk mill. 
  The Yonphung reservoir, an artificial reservoir, gets water 
from the River Chongchon. President Kim Il-song named it 
Yonphung meaning that the people of the Yoltusamcholli plain who 
had suffered from the shortage of water have become to harvest 
bountiful crops every year, with no worry about water. On the 
beach of the reservoir that looks like a sea in a mountain there 
are holiday homes and summer camps. 
  The area of the River Chongchon is the country's major silk 
production base. Yaksan silk of Yongbyon, velvet of Pakchon, 
satin of Anju are popular at home and abroad. 
  Beside, there are historic sites and relics and monumental 
edifices in the area such as the Paeksang pavillion of Anju, the 
Cholong wall, the South Gate and the Yuksung pavilion of 
Yongbyon and the Hyangsan barrage.

  [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- Party and government 
officials saw the 18th part of the multi-part feature film "The 
Nation and Destiny" on May 4. 
  The film was seen by Choe Kwang, Kye Ung-tae, Han Song-yong 
and other senior party and government officials. 
  "The Nation and Destiny" Part 18 which was completed as a 
masterpiece under the guidance of the party deals with the life 
of the heroine Ho Chong-sun who covered an eventful road because 
she failed to meet a wise leader after setting out on the 
communist movement in the 1920s for the independence of Korea. 
  The film deeply anatomizes the tragic communist movement in 
those days when it was divided into various factions by their 
disgusting fighting and vividly proves the truth that only when 
the whole nation is united around the wise leader, guided by 
him, is it possible to restore the lost country and win victory 
in revolution.

  [Text] A key coalition figure was responsible for making 
public the U.S. drug charges against a Chat Thai MP to discredit 
the biggest opposition party for fear it would replace his own 
party in Government, an opposition source alleged yesterday. 
  The source said the resurrection of the U.S. Drug 
Enforcement 
Administration marijuana-trafficking charges against Chat Thai 
MP Thanong Siriprichaphong were "timely" as they came amid 
speculation that the Chat Thai Party under new leader Banhan 
Sinlapa-acha might be considered to replace some coalition 
partners. 
  The source, who is close to both Chat Thai and Chat 
Phatthana 
leaders, said the DEA charges against Mr Thanong lodged with the 
Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB] late last year and 
with the Office of the Supreme Attorney-General two months ago 
were "dug up and publicized" to serve the coalition party's 
political survival. 
  The DEA has been asking Thai authorities to seize the assets 
of Mr Thanong, nicknamed Po Pet, in Thailand under a Thai-U.S. 
legal agreement. His property in the U.S. has already been 
seized. 
  "It was not news today as it all happened months ago. But he 
was smart enough to dig it up and try to tarnish Chat Thai so 
his party would continue to remain with the coalition," said the 
opposition source. 
  He said Phalang Tham deputy leader Prasong Sunsiri should be 
asked for more information about the Thanong drug case. Dubbed 
Thailand's CIA chief, Foreign Minister Prasong was formerly 
secretary-general of the National Security Council. 
  Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong yesterday said the charges 
against Mr Thanong had tarnished the reputation of all MPs. 
  He said it would be up to the Chat Thai Party to issue a 
clarification and decide what to do with the MP. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan said the incident was a 
personal affair but it put the reputation of the entire nation 
at stake. 
  Mr Banhan said he had asked Mr Thanong, who was somewhere in 
his constituency of Nakhon Phanom yesterday, to rush to Bangkok 
today and address a press conference to clear himself of the 
charges. 
  He said he had asked the ONCB and several other agencies 
about the DEA charges against Mr Thanong but none could confirm 
the Chat Thai MP was guilty. 
  The Chat Thai secretary-general who is set to assume the 
party leadership Saturday, said Mr Thanong had told him over the 
telephone he was innocent of all the DEA charges. 
  Mr Banhan said the charges were a personal matter involving 
Mr Thanong and the party would not do anything to protect him if 
he is found guilty. 
  But he said it was "possible" the whole thing was simply a 
rumor designed for political purposes. 
  Mr Banhan said he knew something about the drug scandal but 
could not say anything for lack of hard evidence. 
  "There are so many rumors in Thailand but we are never moved 
by them," he said. 
  The case was not discussed at the weekly luncheon of 
opposition leaders yesterday, according to Social Action Party 
secretary- general Chaloem Yubamrung. 
  SAP leader Montri Phongphanit said he wondered if the recent 
bombings in the South were the work of the coalition rather than 
the Opposition. 
  "I wonder if the coalition partners might be trying to 
topple 
one another through these bombings in the South. This came to 
me after all the accusations that the Opposition is trying to 
overthrow the Government," he said. 
  Pol Capt Chaloem said there was not a single opposition MP 
in 
the South. 
  Chart Thai leader Praman Adireksan complimented the police 
for having arrested a woman in connection with the bombing at a 
railway station in Nakhon Si Thammarat on April 23 which killed 
three people and wounded 18 others.

  [Text] The House committee which oversees MPs' conduct 
yesterday pledged a full inquiry into Chat Thai MP Thanong 
Siriprichaphong, accused by a US court of smuggling huge amounts 
of marijuana into the United States over a period of years. 
  Meanwhile, the opposition yesterday conspicuously deferred a 
decision on a plan to censure the government. It was not 
Aimmediately clear if the opposition bloc was-buying time to 
ponder the possible backlash from the Thanong case. 
  Charoen Khanthawong (Dem-Bangkok), chairman of the House 
committee, said the committee would formally open an 
investigation into the matter next Tuesday. 
  "This will seriously affect the (credibility of) Parliament. 
We must uphold the honor of Parliament by getting to the bottom 
of the matter and explain it to the public," Charoen said. 
  "In my opinion, Thanong should resign and the party to which 
he belongs must also take responsibility." 
  The committee chairman said the most severe measure which 
could be taken against Thanong would be for MPs to sign a motion 
seeking his ouster from the House of Representatives. 
  "But I don't think we will have to resort to such a harsh 
measure," he said. 
  Chat Thai secretary-general Banhan Sinlapa-acha yesterday 
said that no Thai law enforcement officials had confirmed, or 
denied, the allegation that Thanong had been involved in 
trafficking drugs to the US. 
  "The man himself denied he had anything to do with it," 
Banhan said. 
  "The party has yet to see if there is any hard evidence to 
substantiate the charge against Thanong. The way I see it, this 
is a personal affair. The party could not have known about it." 
  However, Banhan said, he had asked Thanong to explain at a 
press conference, probably sometime today. 
  He did not think the timing of the disclosure was aimed at 
hurting Chat Thai's reputation. 
  "This case could not hurt the party's credibility. We have 
yet to see the facts," he said. 
  Banhan would not say when the opposition intended to submit 
a 
no- confidence motion against the Chuan administration or which 
Cabinet members would be targeted in the censure. The 
opposition had been expected to make a decision yesterday. 
  Piyanat Watcharaphon, a former Social Action MP, said the 
Chuan government had apparently neglected to take legal action 
against Thanong though it had been aware of the US charges 
against him for more than a year. 
  "The question is why it was revealed just now, when the 
alleged wrongdoing happened a long time ago," said Piyanat, who 
lost his seat when he was sacked from the party. 
  He believed Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and other coalition 
leaders must have been aware of the matter but had failed to act 
on it. 
  Sources said a group of Democrat MPs plan to submit a motion 
seeking an official inquiry into the cases of Thanong and other 
MPs who have been accused of involvement in international drug 
trafficking. 
  Opposition leaders did not mention their much-heralded plan 
to censure the government when they emerged from a meeting at 
the Princess Hotel yesterday. On Tuesday they had promised a 
decision would be made at the meeting. 
  At a press conference after the meeting, opposition leaders 
instead criticized the government on such issues as terrorism in 
the South and the controversial Pak Mun Dam. They also denied 
allegations that some opposition leaders masterminded the 
southern violence in an attempt to destabilize the government.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Parliament Must Take Action on Drug Charges"] </F>
  [Text] If the reactions of the country's leaders were 
anything to go by, Tuesday's revelation that a Thai politician 
is wanted on drug smuggling charges in the United States doesn't 
really amount to much. 
  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Agency had told him about the case in January 1993 and that he 
had passed the information along to the Justice Ministry. 
  Parliament President Marut Bunnak dismissed the allegations 
as "just a rumor" and said it was premature to start talking 
about setting up a parliamentary committee to investigate them. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan, who oversees 
anti-narcotics agencies, said he thought the Americans had 
enough evidence to back up their charges. He also said the case 
only involved one individual and had done little damage to the 
country's reputation. 
  But Thanong Siriprichaphong is not just an individual. He is 
the honorable member of Parliament for Nakhon Phanom and a 
representative of the Thai people. 
  Earlier this year, as in so many previous years, Thailand 
was 
condemned in the U.S. State Department's annual narcotics report 
because of the "widespread" involvement of high ranking 
government and military officials in the drug trade. 
  Few people in Thailand dispute the accusations. 
  A senior Thai police officer recently told the Associated 
Press: "Who are the big drug people? Just look at the newspapers 
and you'll see some, giving money to charity and getting awards." 
  However, it wasn't until 1992 when Narong Wongwan was forced 
to withdraw as a prime ministerial nominee after the United 
States confirmed he was suspected of being involved in the drug 
trade that any politicians were named. 
  If Thai authorities agree to a seizure request, Thanong 
would 
be the first Thai MP to have assets frozen for involvement in a 
narcotics case. 
  At the moment, the U.S. charges against Thanong remain just 
that -- allegations that have yet to be proven in court. 
  Nevertheless they make interesting reading. 
  The first charge dates back to late 1977, when Thanong was 
said to have arranged for a shipment of two tonnes of marijuana 
to the US west coast. 
  Six years later, he was alleged to have sold 7 tonnes of 
marijuana to American dealers in Mexico. 
  At the beginning of 1986, it is charged he signed a deal to 
supply 18 tonnes of marijuana to American smugglers. Later that 
year, he allegedly agreed to arrange a further shipment of 15 
tonnes, the U.S. prosecutor's affidavit says. 
  Altogether, Thanong is alleged to have arranged for the 
smuggling of about 45 tonnes of marijuana for which he received 
$10.3 million in cash. 
  The affidavit makes for detailed reading. It lists locations 
of meetings, names of smuggling vessels, transaction values and 
more. 
  The evidence contained in the report was considered strong 
enough for a US district court to rule that Thanong's assets in 
the United States be seized. It is now 16 months since the DEA 
supplied the information to the Thai authorities. 
  But as of yesterday many leading law figures, including the 
secretary general of the Office of Narcotics Control Board 
Chawalit Yotmani, said they had yet to even be informed of the 
case by the government. 
  The failure of senior government officials to act on the 
case 
is at the very least another example of Chuan's aversion for 
controversy and at the worst, something much more sinister. 
  The long delay has also no doubt done considerable damage to 
Thailand's relationship with Washington, which is known to be 
increasingly critical of the country's inability to stem the 
drug tide. 
  Now that the charges are public knowledge, Chuan and 
parliament must act decisively. A parliamentary committee 
should be set up immediately and the accusations thoroughly 
investigated. 
  To do any less will only enhance the world's impression that 
the hallowed chambers of Thailand's parliament are a sanctuary 
for drug trafficking suspects.

<F P=106> [News feature: "The Life of Thanong Siriprichaphong"] </F>
  [Text] Thanong Siriprichaphong was born to a middle-class 
family on 24 February 1952 in Si Chiang Mai District, Nong Khai 
Province. He graduated from the University of Honolulu in the 
United States with a B.A. After completing his secondary 
education, his parents moved to Nakhon Phanom Province where 
they started their business of bringing consumer goods into Laos 
for sale and returning to Thailand with forest products and 
scrap iron. 
  During the Vietnam War, Nakhon Phanom was thronged by 
American G.I.'s. Therefore, it was not hard for Thanong to 
boost his status to that of a tycoon by sending all kinds of 
goods for sale to an American camp. Then, he was called Sia 
[tycoon] Po Pet [Thai nickname meaning duck]. As he became 
rich, he invested in various areas such as the Little Duck Hotel 
in Chiang Rai Province, and also operated tour and entertainment 
businesses in the Phatthaya beach resort town in Chon Buri 
Province. At the end of 1992, the Little Duck Group comprised 
19 companies. Among them was the Little Duck Travel Agency 
Company which was granted the right to sell advertisement for TV 
Channel 9 and thus ran into controversy. The company had to 
face an investigation by the Counter Corruption Commission and a 
lawsuit demanding compensation in a private case. 
  In 1993, Thanong planned for a huge land and real estate 
development project in Chiang Mai Province. The project would 
see the building of a hotel, a department store, an 
entertainment center, an aquatic park, an Amusement park, a 
business center, a market, and a wholesale market, all on 300 
rai of land. At present, he is in the process of entering into 
a joint venture with the Imperial Group in the Lat Phrao 
Imperial World project in Bangkok. 
  By doing so, business circles wonder what successes he has 
had to enable him to make such huge investments. 
  In politics, Sia Po Pet, or "Peter" as he is known in 
English, was elected as MP [Member of Parliament] of Nakhon 
Phanom Province for the first time in 1983 as a member of the 
Social Action Party. In 1986, he moved to the Muanchon Party led 
by Police Captain Chaloem Yubamrung. In that year, he stood 
against General Mana Rattanakoset, former leader of the Ratsadon 
Party in a general election in Nakhon Phanom Province and met 
failure for the first time. In 1988, he moved to a new 
constitutency to gain support from sub-district leader Kamnan Po 
in another election but failed again. Despite joining hands with 
General Mana in March, 1992, he failed once more. In September 
of the same year, he ran in an election in Nakhon Phanom 
Province as a member of the Chat Thai Party. This time, he 
succeeded in being elected MP for the second time. Despite of 
his reputation in business circles, it seems that not many 
people know him as an MP.

  [Text] Today Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong 
Sunsiri received Rupert Von Arney, visiting representative of 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]. They discussed 
the refugee situation in Thailand. The UNHCR representative 
expressed satisfaction with the Thai Government's care of the 
refugees. At the meeting, the foreign minister suggested that 
the UN establish an area in Cambodia to receive refugees fleeing 
from the fighting. The UNHCR representative accepted the 
suggestion for consideration. 
  [Begin recording] [Suwit Simasakun, Foreign Ministry 
Information Department director, in progress] ...replied that it 
may be possible to implement the idea. However, it depends on 
the political situation in Cambodia. This is because neither 
Khmer side would want the other to have access to its 
population. In any event, the UNHCR representative accepted the 
idea for consideration. [end recording]

  [Text] A senior Foreign Ministry official yesterday urged 
officials in Phnom Penh to refrain from making remarks that only 
serve to cause ill-feeling between Thailand and Cambodia. 
  "Are people dressed in black always Thai?" asked 
director-general Don Pramutwinai of the Foreign Ministry's East 
Asian Affairs Department. 
  "Thai rangers may wear black but they would not be so stupid 
as to wear their uniform while helping the Khmer Rouge," he said. 
  Mr Don was commenting on remarks by Cambodian Information 
Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse who implied that Thais were 
among the foreigners dressed in black who had fought for the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  Mr Don questioned the reliability of field reports received 
by officials in Phnom Penh and urged them to refrain from making 
remarks based on them. 
  "Are they sure that what they say benefits Cambodia, their 
own situation or the attempt to build better relations with 
neighboring countries?" he asked. 
  Unsubstantiated remarks "only cause ill-feeling" and 
Thailand 
would not pay attention to groundless allegations, he said. 
Cambodia might want to draw attention from other countries but 
should be more constructive about it. 
  Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to settle any doubts in a 
diplomatic manner, he stressed. 
  He cited a recent phone call from Cambodian Foreign Minister 
Prince Norodom Sirivut to Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri.

  [Text] Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak yesterday dismissed 
as untrue a report that the armed forces are dissatisfied with 
this year's military budget which is half a percent less than 
last year's. 
  He said the armed forces understood the Government had 
problems of a higher priority to deal with. 
  Gen Wichit said it was unlikely all ministries could get as 
much money as they asked for since the Government had to 
emphasize other priorities such as investment for infrastructure 
projects. 
  "There are no problems with the armed forces " said the 
minister. 
  However, he said he would seek a bigger allocation for the 
military from the Government. 
  "Whether we will get it depends totally on the Government 
and 
its capacity to collect tax from people to pay for the budget," 
he said. 
  Gen Wichit said this year's military budget had increased by 
more than six billion baht from last year's.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Phu Trong: "The Party's Role and </F>
Leadership Methods Under Present Conditions"] 
  [Text] One of the issues under discussion at the midterm 
national party conference was the need to renovate and revamp 
the party. To be more specific, from the very beginning of the 
drive to contribute suggestions to the draft political report to 
be presented to the conference, party committee echelons, 
cadres, party members, scientists, and veteran cadres already 
expressed their views on this issue. They all aired heartfelt 
and many-sided opinions, thus reflecting their deep concern for 
this decisive and important task. 
  The conference ascertained that party leadership is an issue 
of principled character and constitutes the most decisive factor 
guaranteeing success for our country's national development 
based on socialist orientations. This concept is also one of 
the most important lessons drawn from implementing the reform 
process over the past many years. As our country shifts to a 
market- oriented economy, implements democratization to benefit 
society, and broadens relations with the outside world, there is 
a greater need to strengthen and renovate the party's 
leadership. We renovate the party's leadership but do not 
distance ourselves from those issues of principled character or 
negate past achievements. We renovate the party's leadership 
through rational policies and steps, taking into account 
dialectical and many-sided relations. The practical experiences 
drawn from a number of countries in the world indicate that just 
a little bit of faltering faith and lax leadership by the 
Communist Party will instantly create loopholes for hostile and 
opposition forces to move forward to disintegrate the party 
leadership system, seize power, and shift the country to a 
different path. As far as our country is concerned, the 
Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] is the only ruling party. This 
is a mandate of history. The party itself has undergone a 
protracted and arduous struggle full of challenges and 
sacrifices. The administration and achievements we have today 
are brought about by tens of thousands of outstanding sons and 
daughters of the party and people who have lost their lives. As 
far as Vietnam is concerned, our party's leadership is an 
objective requirement and a necessary condition for guaranteeing 
social order and political stability for the cause of national 
construction and development. 
  Being the ruling party that directs society in shifting to 
the market-oriented economy and given the current complicated 
international situation, the CPV realizes very clearly its honor 
and responsibility toward the country and people. In its 
capacity as a ruling party, our party exerts leadership over and 
consolidates the administration to make it firm and strong. It 
also directs society and takes responsibility before the country 
and people. As a ruling party, the party represents not only 
the interests of the working class, but also fights for the 
interests of laborers as a whole and becomes the vanguard 
political brigade of the entire nation. Let us pose the 
following question: Over the past 60 years or more, who has led 
the people through the ups and downs of an arduous struggle and 
sacrificed everything for national independence and freedom as 
well as for the people's well-being and happiness? Today, who 
has worked night and day on ways to help the country overcome 
challenges, firmly safeguard national independence and 
sovereignty, make the people rich and the nation powerful, bring 
about justice and civilization in society, and reduce poverty in 
urban and rural areas? It is crystal clear that nobody other 
than the CPV by following the Marxist-Leninist path and Uncle 
Ho's ideology has constantly worked and made sacrifices for the 
country and people. 
  Under present conditions, the party's leadership role is 
reflected through the formulation of national development 
orientations and goals aimed at bringing about prosperity for 
the nation and people. Based on the aforementioned orientations 
and goals, the party directs the overall political and social 
systems, first of all the state apparatus, in materializing at 
all costs set goals and tasks. It also directs work aimed at 
institutionalizing and legalizing party resolutions, planning 
and organizing the mechanisms, training and managing cadres, 
overseeing the implementation of party policies and lines, and 
reviewing experiences drawn from real life situations and 
supplementing or perfecting policies and lines.... All of the 
aforementioned tasks have but a single objective, namely 
guaranteeing correct political orientations for national 
construction and development. 
  In the economic area, we must ensure that there are 
political characteristics in the development of our economy to 
ensure that the economy enjoys both a high development rate and 
productivity with an increasing production force, and that it 
moves correctly in the socialist direction to limit injustice 
and exploitation and protects the interests of laborers. This 
must be manifested not only at the central management level, but 
also in each party cell. Each party installation and every 
cadre and party member is responsible for a thorough 
understanding of the party's political direction in the 
all-around socioeconomic activities. This is a function that 
cannot be done by anybody else. 
  The paramount responsibility of party committees at all 
levels is to lead, control, and strive for efficient 
implementation of party lines and policies to ensure that the 
activities of all economic sectors and social organizations are 
in line with the socialist direction. Party committees, primary 
party organizations, and party members in joint ventures and 
private business are responsible for leading the people and 
public organizations in bringing party resolutions and state 
laws into life. They must protect the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers and laborers. Any party committee or party 
organ which does not fulfill these tasks is not correctly 
carrying out its functions and duties. 
  After several years of reform process, our party's 
leadership 
and working attitude, from the central to grassroots levels, 
have improved greatly in the direction of becoming more 
democratic, principled, attached to the grassroots, and 
practical. They have ensured both a close and efficient party 
leadership and have also developed the positive role of state 
organs and mass organizations. However, we must admit that the 
management quality and operational efficiency of many party 
committees are not on par with requirements in the new 
situation. Their organizational mechanism is still heavy, 
bulky, and overlapping and they are slow to improve their 
management and working attitude. Many places, especially in the 
grassroots, are having difficulties differentiating the 
functions and duties of the party from the government. In 
addition to the tendency to heighten the party role to cover 
everything, there is also a tendency to lighten and lessen the 
party role. 
  In the current situation, renovating the party's leadership 
role means that it must correctly carry out its leading role at 
the same time as efforts to strongly develop the role of state 
organs, economic units, and mass organizations. The party 
committees must not cover and perform the administration 
management and coordination tasks. 
  The party's leadership over the government is to make sure 
that our government is a government of the people, by the 
people, and for the people and to make it strong and efficient 
in which it will actively operate in accordance with the 
functions and authorities outlined by law, correctly implement 
the party line and conception, and closely associate with the 
public. A socialist government is basically different from a 
bourgeois government to the point that the former is not the 
boss standing above and dominating the people. It is the highest 
organ under the leadership of the Communist Party to represent 
the right to mastery of the people, who fundamentally consist of 
workers, peasants, and intellectuals. 
  The leadership of the party does not mean that the party 
will 
substitute for the government in performing state management and 
executing administration work, or on behalf of the people to 
exert a mastery role over the government. The party is there to 
develop all creative public potential and educate and organize 
the people to build their own government and to use that 
government to transform society and engage the country in the 
socialist construction undertaking. The party and state 
guarantee and implement the people's right to mastery and to 
work for the public interest according to their functions and 
methods. 
  At present, there are conspiracies to divide the party and 
state, as well as oppose the party and state against the public 
in order to eliminate the party leadership, overthrow the 
government, and annihilate our socialist regime. We must 
heighten our vigilance against these conspiracies. 
  We cannot separate or oppose the party and state, nor can we 
identify the party with the state. The party leads the state 
and the political system, but, at the same time, it is a part of 
the political system and a member of the Fatherland Front. The 
party provides guidance for forming the Constitution and the 
law, and at the same time it operates in conformity with the 
Constitution and the law. Party cadres and members are not 
above the law and they do not work outside the bounds of the law. 
  The party leads other organizations in the political system 
not only by its lines, but also in organizational structure 
under the principle of democratic centralism and the principle 
of collective leadership and individual responsibility. The 
party exerts its leadership through the party organization -- 
not through individual party members -- by collective decisions 
and by keeping watch, providing guidance, and checking to 
encourage the good and correct wrongdoings. The party provides 
concrete guidance, but it does not get into the details of 
official duties and it does not issue orders. It leads by 
democratic methods, not by totalitarianism and arbitrariness. 
  The party also needs to renovate the content of its 
activities and working method to become more democratic, 
disciplined, and active. It must reduce the number of meetings 
to intensify its control work, mingle at the grass roots, and 
stay close to the masses. 
  Party members are deployed in state organs, economic units, 
and mass organizations to work according to the party's platform 
and lines and by the principle of democratic centralism. They 
must implement party resolutions in an exemplary way, strictly 
observe state law, and regularly motivate and persuade the 
public to follow suit. 
  The party mechanism also needs to improve to make it lighter 
and more active, efficient, and suitable to the new management 
structure. This can be carried out satisfactorily only when it 
is done carefully on the basis of reviewing all organizational 
models and further concretizing the management method in each 
level, sector, and different form of grassroots organization. 
This should be done only after careful study and calculation to 
avoid unsound "separation" and "integration," which causes waste 
and chaos. 
  With a thorough understanding of the reform principle and 
direction outlined by the seventh national party congress and 
the midterm national party conference, and the active and 
uniform execution of measures to renovate and reorganize the 
party, we will definitely enhance the leadership role and 
fighting power of the entire party, thus meeting the goal of 
reforms and the expectations of the public.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA May 4 -- Vietsovpetro is on target to 
record yet another substantial production increase this year 
reporting output 1 per cent above its scheduled plan in the 
first quarter. This year, vietsovpetro plans to tap 6.9 
million tonnes of crude oil, an increase of 600,000 tonnes over 
last year's figure, while setting a target of 50 million tonnes 
from now to 2000. To reach that goal, vietsovpetro has invested 
hundreds of millions of dollars in the purchase of new drilling 
vessels, 155,000 tonne tankers, while renewing derrick equipment. 
  Preparations are being made to begin the operation in the 
second oilfield, nearby Rong (Dragon) within this year. Two 
rigs have been set up and six wells have been sunk on this new 
field. Bach Ho (white tiger) is the first oilfield to begin 
commercial production in the country: vietsovpetro has already 
pumped over 14 million tonnes of crude oil from white tiger 
oilfield. Vietsovpetro is a joint venture between Vietnam and 
the former Soviet Union, and has been operating since 1986.

<F P=106> [Cha Man-sun Reports from Vienna] </F>
  [Text] On 3 May, Hans Blix, secretary general of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], has sent an urgent 
telegram to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam in an 
attempt to make a breakthrough in the issue of witnessing the 
changing of fuel rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in 
Yonbyon. 
  In the telegram, he emphasized that the IAEA would send its 
inspectors if North Korea accepts the demands set forth by the 
IAEA, and pointed out that the changing of nuclear fuel rods 
without witnesses may lead to a serious situation under which 
the transparency of North Korea's nuclear development cannot be 
guaranteed. 
  It was reported that Secretary General Hans Blix may have 
stressed that the IAEA would be compelled to report to the UN 
Security Council of its inability to confirm whether nuclear 
materials are being diverted in the event that the nuclear fuel 
rods are changed without the presence of inspectors. 
  Considering that all previous communications have been made 
through a working-level channel, the IAEA secretary general's 
urgent telegram is taken to be a very unusual step that hints of 
an acute situation and that can be interpreted as an ultimatum 
regarding the changing of nuclear fuel rods. This step was taken 
as the situation turned more serious as North Korea recently 
reiterated its position to go ahead with the changing of its 
nuclear fuel rods in a statement released by the North Korean 
Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Seoul, May 5 (YONHAP) -- A senior South Korean 
Foreign Ministry official expressed regrets Thursday over 
controversial comments by a top Japanese justice official that 
Japan was not an aggressor in World War II and the war was aimed 
at liberation of colonies. 
  Saying that the Seoul government is looking into a real 
intention behind the remarks by Japan's Justice Minister Shigeto 
Nagano, the official said he felt sorry for a cabinet minister 
of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and 
contribution to the international community to have such a 
consciousness of history. 
  "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to 
redress the past," the official maintained. 
  Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the 
national daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN Tuesday by contending that the 
Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead designed 
for liberation of colonies and a greater East Asia coprosperity 
sphere. 
  Nagano also argued that the "rape of Nanjing" in China was a 
hoax.

  [Text] The Export-Import Bank of Korea is a special 
government financial institution whose purpose is to promote the 
development of the Korean economy and economic cooperation with 
foreign countries. 
  To accomplish this, the bank supports export and import 
transactions, overseas investment projects, and the development 
of natural resources abroad through extending loans, providing 
re-lending facilities and issuing guarantees. 
  The bank also operates the Economic Development Cooperation 
Fund (EDCF) and the South-North Korea Cooperation Fund (SNKCF), 
both entrusted by the government. Since its establishment, Korea 
Eximbank has supported over 1,800 projects in approximately 100 
countries around the world, contributing to the economic 
development of those nations. 
<H5>  History of Operations </H5>
  The bank was established July 1, 1976 under the 
Export-Import 
Bank of Korea Act. Since then, Eximbank's programs have been 
renewed and developed, reflecting the bank's determination to 
shape its operations to match the changing circumstances of 
domestic and global markets. 
  From the early stage of its founding, the bank has been 
extending financial support for export transactions under 
medium- and long-term credit, overseas investment and the 
development of natural resources abroad. 
  Imports of raw materials, essential supplies, sophisticated 
machinery and related high technology have been financed by the 
bank since April 1, 1988. 
  The bank has also been operating the EDCF and SNKCF, both 
entrusted by the government, since June 1, 1987 and March 20, 
1991, respectively. 
  The bank had operated the export insurance scheme from Jan. 
1, 1977 to July 7, 1992, when Korea Export Insurance Corp. 
(KEIC) was founded and took over the scheme. 
<H5>  Major Activities </H5>
  Korea Eximbank supports exports principally through 
extending 
loans directly to both suppliers and buyers, providing relending 
facilities to foreign financial institutions, and issuing 
guarantees. 
  The bank plays a complementary role to commercial banks, and 
does not compete with them in providing financial services. 
  When operating the programs, the bank requires reasonable 
assurance of repayment as prescribed in the Export-Import Bank 
of Korea Act, after reviewing technical, managerial, and 
financial soundness of the borrower and the project concerned. 
  Financing is the most important activity of Eximbank, and is 
designed to assist and encourage export of capital goods and 
services, overseas investment, and major resources development, 
which usually require larger credits and longer repayment 
periods. The bank also assists imports of certain natural 
resources and high-tech equipment. 
  The bank's financing services fall into several categories. 
The most important services are export credit, overseas 
investment credit, major resources development credit, and 
import credit. 
  The bank provides guarantees to Korean commercial banks and 
foreign banks that participate in cofinancing with the bank. 
The bank also directly guarantees a foreign importer that a 
Korean firm will perform as contracted. 
  The business of operating and managing EDCF and SNKCF is 
also 
vital to the bank's activities. EDCF aims at enhancing economic 
cooperation by providing ODA (official development assistance) 
loans required for the industrial development and economic 
stabilization of other developing countries. 
  SNKCF, under the initiative and policy coordination of the 
National Unification Board, intends to expand mutual exchange 
and cooperation with North Korea. 
  Financing services have received the highest priority among 
the bank's activities, since they are the primary means of 
fulfilling the mandate to support external transactions. 
  In 1980, the bank introduced its cofinancing program. The 
co-financing partners can be either domestic or foreign banking 
institutions. 
  Export credit has enjoyed much popularity among Korean 
exporters, accounting for the lion's share of the bank's total 
credit amount. 
  This credit is mainly categorized into three types: export 
loan, direct loan and relending facility. 
  Export loans is extended to Korean exporters as a supplier 
credit, in order to provide them with the required funds to 
finance exports of designated capital goods, such as industrial 
plants ships, rolling stocks, industrial machinery, electrical 
equipment, vehicles, iron and steel products, nonferrous metal 
products, aircraft, optical instruments, precision and medical 
equipment, and parts and components thereof. 
  Direct loan is provided to foreign entities as a buyer 
credit, in order to finance the purchase of the same capital 
goods as those eligible for export loan. The contract price 
shall be in excess of $1 million. 
  Both loans are available in foreign currencies or Korean won 
up to 100 percent of the export contract price, less a minimum 
15-20 percent cash payment, on a medium- and long-term basis. 
<H5>  Guarantees </H5>
  Eximbank provides guarantees to Korean commercial banks, 
local branches of foreign banks, and foreign banks that 
participate in transactions financed by the bank. The bank also 
directly guarantees foreign importers that Korean firms, will 
perform as contracted. 
  The bank provides a 100 percent guarantee of principal and 
interest to co-financing banks for transactions of usually up to 
five years. 
  The bank provides a foreign importer with a 100 percent 
guarantee to refund the cash payment for medium- and long-term 
transactions when it becomes impossible for the domestic 
exporter to perform as contracted. 
<H5>  EDCF Services </H5>
  The Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) is a 
bilateral official development assistance (ODA) program 
established by the Korean government in June 1987 to support the 
desire of other developing countries to shape their economic 
development, and encourage a beneficial relationship with these 
countries as well. 
  The government regulates the principal policies and general 
outlines of EDCF, while the bank handles project appraisals, 
executes loan agreements, monitors the projects, provides 
advisory services and carries out other functions for EDCF under 
the guidelines of the government.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Yu Kun-ha] </F>
  [Text] John Toppel, president of Samsung Hewlett-Packard 
Co. (SHP), is getting increasingly impatient these days with the 
Seoul government's ban on laser printer imports. Toppel feels 
that it is time the Korean government lifted the ban as it is 
staging a campaign to make the nation "the world's most 
convenient place to do business in." 
  "I hear that the government is seeking to globalize its 
economy. Then, it should begin with allowing foreign firms 
operating in Korea to compete with local firms on an equal 
footing," Toppel asserted. The ban, according to Toppel, is 
forcing SHP to compete with local firms "with its hands tied." 
  Toppel's firm, a 10-year-old joint venture between Samsung 
Electronics and Hewlett-Packard (HP) of the United States, is in 
a dominant position in the domestic printer market. Backed by 
HP, the world's unrivaled printer powerhouse, SHP enjoys a more 
than 40 percent share of the total domestic demand valued at 
about $360 million last year. SHP's market share is expected to 
shoot up further as demand is rapidly shifting from 
old-fashioned dot matrix printers to more sophisticated ink-jet 
products, currently the firm's mainstay. 
  What makes Toppel uncomfortable, however, is the fact that a 
local printer maker, Samsung Electronics, has recently launched 
an attack against its ink-jet printers with self-developed laser 
printers. Samsung has recently announced a 42 percent price cut 
on its low-end laser model, making it clear that its target is 
ink-jet printers, which are mostly imported from abroad. 
  Last year, Samsung exported some 100,000 units of the model, 
a fact indicating that the firm has secured some competitiveness 
in the low-end segment of the world laser printer market. "Under 
this situation, it is unfair that we still cannot compete with 
Samsung with the same laser printers, not ink-jet printers," 
Toppel said. 
  Toppel's point cannot be refuted. But to government 
officials, policy priority still lies not with creating an 
environment for equal competition but with fostering the 
domestic laser printer industry. Officials at the Ministry of 
Trade, Industry and Energy (MOTIE) said that they still have no 
plan to open the laser printer market. "We think the need still 
exists for us to foster the domestic laser printer industry," a 
MOTIE official said, adding that as laser printer technology is 
important, the import ban will stay for a "considerably long" 
period of time. 
  Toppel argued that Korea will have more to gain than lose by 
opening the market. For one thing, it will stimulate efforts on 
the part of Korean printer makers to upgrade their technology 
and sharpen competitiveness. 
  At the moment, Samsung is the only domestic firm which is 
mass producing laser printers. Although Samsung may be 
competitive in the low-end segment, it is still not in fighting 
shape in the high-end market. The same is true of Goldstar Co. 
which, following Samsung, is seeking to explore overseas 
markets. According to company officials, they are ready to 
introduce a low-end laser printer model in the latter half of 
this year for both domestic and foreign markets. 
  The new model, they said, will be competitive in the 
international market in terms of both price and quality. But 
they admitted that other models they are producing now are not 
as competitive as the planned new one. This may imply that it is 
still too early for the government to open the laser printer 
market entirely. It may instead open the market on a 
step-by-step basis, which will not only stimulate catch-up 
efforts by domestic products but also diffuse pressure for 
market opening from foreign firms. 
  Toppel expects the market will open in due course. At the 
same time, he wants to see the import ban lifted soon. But the 
SHP president emphasized that he will not loudly call for a 
removal of the ban. SHP, he noted, has been very cooperative 
with the Korean government while being a respectable corporate 
citizen in the Korean business community.

  [Text] Four local financial institutions have signed a 110 
billion won (about $137.5 million) syndicated loan contract with 
a petrochemical arm of Hyundai Business Group. If extended, it 
will be the first large loan made to a subsidiary of the group 
since the inauguration of the current government, which has had 
strained relations with the group. 
  The syndicated loan will be extended to Hyundai 
Petrochemical 
Co. by Boram Bank, Korea Long-Term Credit Bank, Kwangju Bank and 
KKBC International, Ltd., financial sources said yesterday. The 
four institutions together will extend the company the loan 
composed of 87.6 billion won in Korean won and the remaining sum 
in U.S. dollars. 
  The Korean currency portion of the syndicated loan will 
carry 
an annual interest rate of 12.4 percent and be paid back in 
installments over four years after a three-year grace period. 
  Hyundai Petrochemical Co. will pay back the U.S. dollar 
fraction carrying an annual interest of 4.7 percent over five 
and a half years after two and a half years of deferment of 
interest and principal payments, the sources said. The company 
reportedly plans to use the money in importing capital goods and 
setting up a synthetic rubber plant in a petrochemical complex 
on the western coastal area of Taesan, South Chungchong Province. 
  The financial sources pointed out that despite the signing 
of 
the contract, it remains to be seen whether Hyundai will 
actually borrow money from the institutions. Initially, the 
group contacted the state-owned Korea Development Bank [KDB] for 
an investment loan for expanding the petrochemical company but 
was rejected. 
  Speculation was rampant that the government had ordered KDB 
to turn down Hyundai's request for political reasons. Hyundai 
allegedly failed to get the loan because Chong Chu-yong, founder 
and honorary chairman of Hyundai Group, angered President Kim 
Yong-sam during the 1992 presidential election campaign by 
vilifying him. 
  Meanwhile, Chong announced in a news conference Tuesday that 
he would not interfere in the management of Hyundai Group and 
will devote himself to managing his mammoth farm on reclaimed 
land in Sosan, South Chungchong Province. 
  The presidential office of Chongwadae was reportedly 
dissatisfied with Chong's announcement and the financial sources 
presumed it is still unclear whether Hyundai will get the loan. 
The four financial institutions, however, said that they had 
signed the loan contract independent of the political circle. 
The loan contract, the sources said, provides ample grist for 
the rumor mill that local banks and nonbank financial 
institutions have lifted their restrictions on loans to the 
conglomerate.

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- Farm and fishery market 
brokers ended their two-day strike Wednesday evening after the 
government decided [to] shelve the planned enforcement of the 
new law on farm produce distribution and price stabilization for 
the next six months. 
  Yi Chong-su, secretary of the Association of Brokers Unions, 
said his association members would return to normal farm and 
fishery goods wholesaling and auctioning on Wednesday evening. 
  "I think the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, 
which had taken a mistaken policy, seems to have come to know 
the sufferings of farm and fishery goods producers," Yi said. 
  Market brokers went on a strike on Tuesday in protest 
against 
the implementation of the new law which they argued would 
heavily undermine their interests.

<F P=106> [Interview with King Norodom Sihanouk by local and foreign </F>
members of the Cambodian Journalists Association at the Royal 
Palace in Phnom Penh on 2 May -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted -- introduction of journalists 
and Sihanouk's views on press freedom and women's rights] 
[Sihanouk] Now let us deal with the second problem, about the 
royal guard. Let me tell you that I used to have an army and I 
trusted His Excellency [H.E.] Lon Nol more than anyone. Lon Nol 
got all of his ranks and positions because of me. At that time, 
H.E. Nhoek Chulong retired and H.E. Lon Nol was given command of 
the army. H.E. Lon Nol was even entrusted with the premiership 
of the Royal Government when I made an official visit to the 
Soviet Union. Then, together with Prince Sirik Matak, H.E. Lon 
Nol deposed me in Phnom Penh. Ever since, as all of you know, 
we have experienced nothing but hardship and misery. You know 
how difficult life has been since that coup d'etat. 
  So how can I trust the army? I was betrayed by those who 
were supposed to be my personal guards, by my own prime 
minister, and especially by the army itself. Mr. Lon Nol was 
the head of a royal army, not a republican army; a royal guard, 
not a presidential guard. He deposed me when he was commander 
of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces. The same story can be heard in 
many African and Latin American countries. The head of state is 
deposed when he is visiting foreign countries, and is deposed by 
his own soldiers. For this reason, I no longer want my soldiers 
to be my royal guard. 
  The other day, H.E. [words indistinct] and some other 
excellencies asked if they could form my royal guard. I said: 
Wait, do you want to depose me? [laughter] 
  It was not another army but the army close to me that 
deposed 
me. Who deposed me? My prime minister did; my commander in 
chief himself did. Many heads of state around the world have 
been deposed by their own right-hand men. So let it be known 
that I will no longer accept my own soldiers as bodyguards. 
Some may wonder why as a Khmer I do not use my fellow Khmers to 
protect me. Please excuse me. If you do not want me to die 
soon, or to be ousted soon, permit me to be protected by my 
Korean bodyguards. I have 25 now, and President Kim Il-song has 
assured me that if I want to have 50 he will send another 25. 
Each of these Koreans has been trained to handle 100 
adversaries; one against 100 [preceding three words in French]. 
So 10 of them can fight against 1,000, and 20 against 2,000. 
If I have 50, they will be able to fight many, many more 
adversaries. 
  Therefore, do not give me any nonsense about making 
arrangements for my protection. There was a request made to 
President Kim Il-song asking for ammunition and [word 
indistinct] to set up a division to protect Samdech Sihanouk. 
President Kim Il-song replied that he would provide anything 
Samdech Sihanouk wished. I quickly entreated President 
Kim-Il-song not to give anything; not to reply to the request. 
This is because if such an arrangement were made, it would be 
possible for those who made it to depose me. Therefore, I beg 
your pardon for not being duped. I want to make it clear that I 
would not accept that arrangement. I have already asked 
President Kim Il-song not to give you anything. If he did, I 
would be killed; I would be deposed. 
  So all of my trust is placed in my 25 Korean friends. I am 
waiting for the Khmer Rouge to return the land they are using 
before I increase the number of Korean guards to 50. I need the 
land to build living quarters for them. I am in great need of 
space, and the land now occupied by the Khmer Rouge would be a 
good site to build houses for my 50 Korean guards. I have 25 of 
them now. It is sufficient, but they are working too hard -- 
around the clock without rest -- for my protection. 
  That is my answer to the second question. I refuse to accept 
a Cambodian royal guard. Who deposed me? Lon Nol did. 
[passage omitted including journalist's two-part question] 
  Now, let us discuss the second question concerning the Khmer 
Rouge and the roundtable. 
  Your Excellency Kong Sam-ol, is it not true that a round 
table has been prepared? We use a round table, without any 
edges, to illustrate our idea of equality for all parties living 
in the same family, free from any distinction regarding status, 
rank, or position. Those who sit at the round table are among 
equals. No one is head of state, prime minister, National 
Assembly chairman, or a mere party leader. We are all in the 
same family at the round table. 
  Yet the roundtable meeting is impossible. This is a matter 
of great concern because our people want peace. Why? If there 
is war, the people suffer greatly. Not only the people, but 
soldiers and the rank and file will all be miserable. Everyone 
will suffer, and so will our efforts at national reconstruction. 
The culprit is war. For this reason, we must seek to stop the 
fighting by all means. If there is disagreement between the 
Khmer Rouge and the Royal Government, both sides must agree to 
talk to each other like brothers. They must not reject or 
oppose talks. 
  [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] My plan was this: Both 
sides would meet for three to four hours at a time, after which 
the negotiators would come out and meet with the media. Those 
of you in the media would grill them thoroughly to learn about 
their positions. Once you understood their positions, our 
people would also come to understand them through your good 
offices. 
  That was my plan, but we could not do it for now. Why? It 
was for this reason: At first, Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen rejected the proposal for the 
meeting to be held inside the Royal Palace, although they have 
agreed to it now. Khieu Samphan said that it was not safe for 
him to stay near the Royal Palace, citing security reasons. He 
asked that he and his delegation be allowed to stay in the Royal 
Palace; not the Khemarin Palace [Sihanouk's residence], but a 
building inside the Royal Palace compound so as to be close to 
the king for protection. I agreed to that request and Prince 
Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen -- who were opposed to the idea 
before -- have now agreed to it. So I wrote to Khieu Samphan 
yesterday. Khieu Samphan replied, saying thanks but no thanks. 
He said Phnom Penh was not neutral and he wants to meet at a 
neutral venue, perhaps meaning somewhere abroad. He said that no 
place in the country is neutral. So we cannot go anywhere in 
Cambodia to meet -- Siem Reap, Pailin, Kep, Sihanoukville -- 
none would be neutral. Therefore he asked to meet in Paris, 
Jakarta, Pyongyang, or Beijing. Prince Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim have told me 
they adamantly refuse to meet the Khmer Rouge abroad. They 
insist that the meeting must be inside the country. 
  The current situation is this: Khieu Samphan refuses to meet 
inside the country and demands to go outside, while the leaders 
in Phnom Penh refuse to go outside the country and insist on 
meeting inside. 
  The other day I met with French Minister Francois Fillon, 
who 
came here on behalf of his head of state; his government. He 
assured me that France would do anything I wished. I told him I 
would ask Prince Krompreah Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen if they 
would agree to go to Paris. If they go, Khieu Samphan will also 
go because he will go anywhere as long as it is not inside 
Cambodia. Unfortunately, Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen 
answered that they would not go to Paris, Jakarta, Pyongyang, 
Beijing, or anywhere outside of Cambodia. With such a 
difference of views, we have certainly arrived at an impasse; a 
dead end. In order to hold a roundtable, each side must be 
willing to compromise. Without compromise there can be no 
solution. [passage omitted] 
  How can we rebuild the country with the war raging? Our 
natural resources are being destroyed by the war. Therefore, we 
must put an end to the war; there must be an unconditional 
cease-fire [preceding two words in English]. There must be no 
conditions at all. There must be an unconditional cease-fire 
and negotiations. That is my proposal even today; I repeat, 
today [preceding nine words in English]. But who will listen to 
me? 
  If no one listens, it becomes a very difficult situation, 
especially now that the Khmer Rouge is winning. How can you 
expect the Khmer Rouge to join the roundtable readily if they 
are still feeling high from their victory? 
  There is another thing. They say they refuse to let the 
Khmer Rouge join the government; that they would not amend the 
Constitution to let the Khmer Rouge join the government. So we 
have nothing to give them in return. My idea was to give the 
Khmer Rouge some reward for transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng, 
Preah Vihear; and so on -- that is, all the autonomous Khmer 
Rouge regions -- back to the Royal Government. As compensation, 
the Royal Government should enact a small constitutional 
amendment to allow the Khmer Rouge to join the government. You 
do not have to mention the Khmer Rouge specifically by name, 
just say that if you need someone from outside of parliament, 
you can do it. The practice of bringing in people who did not 
participate in the elections is common in other countries. We 
did it under Sangkum Reas Niyum. 
  So I asked them to consider all of that. They answered that 
they would not give anything to the Khmer Rouge. Samdech Chea 
Sim wrote me that whatever the Khmer Rouge asked for, this side 
would not give it to them. If they are not given anything, what 
will they get in exchange? In exchange for the Khmer Rouge 
transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng, Preah Vihear, and other zones 
under their control to us, the Royal Government should have some 
rewards for them. The government's current position, however, 
is that the Khmer Rouge can come in but will get nothing for it. 
So they have no choice but to continue fighting. If we win, it 
will be great; if they win, though, it will be serious for us. 
  For the time being, no one seems to have the upper hand. 
There is no winner or loser. Only the people are the losers; 
they are not directly engaged in the fighting, but they have 
been fleeing everywhere. Some 25,000 fled to Thailand and 
10,000 others are joining them now. During the battle of 
Pailin, 10,000 civilians and soldiers fled in confusion into 
Battambang. The people are the ones who are suffering. 
Moreover, many bridges and roads have been destroyed. If the 
fighting among Khmers continues, our nation will perish. Our 
country will be wiped out if we Khmers continue to fight and 
kill each another without pity or compromise. Who will benefit 
from that? Our neighbors will; the foreigners will, especially 
Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand and Vietnam are not going to 
invade us anymore, but they will benefit when we go down. Each 
time one Khmer kills another, the foreigners gain. 
  [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Our experience, therefore, 
shows us -- teaches us -- that we must not fight each other; we 
must regard each other as brothers. This should only be the 
Royal Government's stand; both sides should uphold this common 
stance. The Khmer Rouge, however, have never understood this 
concept. When they were in power, they constantly boasted they 
had saved the nation. How could they have saved it when 2-3 
million Khmers perished? Some Vietnamese also died, of course, 
but many more Khmers lost their lives than Vietnamese. The 
Khmer Rouge must be held responsible for the deaths of 2-3 
million Khmers. How could they boast of being the protectors -- 
the saviors -- of the Khmer race? 
  Their sale of gems to foreigners -- as well as allowing 
foreigners to come in and cut our trees -- does not serve the 
national interest. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is at fault; 
serious fault. Of course, I am not passing judgment on this or 
that person. I am not saying that this person must be punished 
and that person must be acquitted. I am merely asking everyone 
to end the fighting and start negotiations. This is just my 
personal opinion. If we have to go to Paris, then let us go to 
Paris so we can explore any possible way to make peace. If we 
resume fighting without even trying to end it by all possible 
means, we will not be at peace with ourselves. We should talk 
in Paris to see who is right and who is wrong. The ultimate 
truth will be revealed to everyone, because some of you in the 
media who have the means will go and listen to the discussions 
in Paris. 
  Why Paris? I had asked for the meeting be held in the DPRK. 
I own a very large palace near Pyongyang called the Land of 
Longevity. There is a lake in front of my palace. There are 
small hills, pine trees, and a cool breeze. President Kim 
Il-song donated this land to Cambodia and officially recognized 
it as Cambodian territory. We would be meeting on Cambodian 
soil in Pyongyang, but they rejected my offer. So, because 
Pyongyang was unacceptable, I proposed that we go to Paris or 
Jakarta. France and Indonesia were the cochairs of the 
Cambodian peace treaty that we all signed in Paris on 23 October 
1991. Our problem remains linked with Paris and Jakarta as the 
cochairs. Therefore, we should seek their help in finding a 
solution to our dispute. If the Phnom Penh side disagrees with 
this, I cannot help it. I know that Khieu Samphan would accept 
because he will go anywhere provided it is outside of Cambodia. 
He would go anywhere. This evening I am going to meet with 
Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. This 
morning I am meeting with you from the media, and in the evening 
I will meet with the two leaders and we will see what their 
position is. Then I will make my findings known to all of you 
in a few lines of writing to both the national and international 
press. 
  So this is all I have to tell you at this moment. Do not 
worry. I will continue to make efforts toward peace, because the 
longer the fighting lasts, the more people will perish. 
Moreover, we will never be at peace with ourselves if we fail 
to explore every possibility for peace. When we really run out 
of peaceful means -- when there is no other way but war -- then 
we will go to war. I do not give my blessing, of course, but if 
both sides really want to fight they should go ahead and fight. 
You will be responsible to history. 
  If I were given the choice -- the power to decide -- I would 
stop the fighting; order an immediate and unconditional 
cease-fire [preceding two words in French and repeated in 
English]. Yes, if I could decide I would order two things: A 
cease-fire -- cessation of the killing -- and talk. [passage 
omitted] 
  Your king's position can be summed up as follows: First, 
there must be an end to hostility -- there must be peace; and 
second, there must be a roundtable. If this roundtable cannot 
be held here at home, it should be held somewhere outside the 
country. In my opinion, this is a good compromise to save 
either side from a possible loss of face. It is quite 
convenient to go to Paris. The other option is Jakarta. We can 
go anywhere provided the three samdeches first agree to go 
abroad, and second accept a venue convenient to them. If they 
decide not to go, then we will come to a dead end. That is one 
possible scenario. 
  If they are forced to agree to go abroad, the king will be 
criticized for being pro-Khmer Rouge; blindly working for them. 
They would think that when the Khmer Rouge asked to be quartered 
in the Royal Palace we had to concede to their request; that the 
Khmer Rouge won that round. Now the Khmer Rouge has rejected a 
roundtable inside of the country and the king again wants us to 
go abroad. 
  So, my children, this is my position: I dare not make 
another appeal to the three samdeches. If I do, they will say 
that the king is not neutral; that the king only loves the Khmer 
Rouge and is harsh toward his children on the other side. So I 
do not dare put any pressure on the three samdeches. If the 
three samdeches listen to the radio, they should understand my 
position. When we agreed to this interview, I requested that 
our state radio and television broadcast it fully; not 
partially. Please broadcast the whole thing, even if it lasts 
until 2300 or midnight. IBC [International Broadcasting 
Corporation], which is making a lot of money in the television 
business, is also invited to maximize its broadcast of this 
interview so that our people -- both our leaders and the masses 
-- know everything. 
  Many of you from the media are present here, but quite a few 
are absent. Do the absentees hate me? Are they trying to avoid 
me? [laughter] 
  That is alright. I do not mind. They will not miss 
anything, though. You who are here and will surely brief them 
on what the king said. Anyway, they can listen to the radio or 
watch television. [passage omitted] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am from the KHMER APPYEAKROET 
newspaper. I wish to ask your majesty two questions: 
  First question: Do you have any other means or solutions to 
solve the deadlocked roundtable issue so that the warring 
parties will sit at the negotiating table, end the war, and make 
peace for the Cambodian people? 
  Second question: This is a question about ethnic Vietnamese. 
Cambodia belongs to the Cambodians. When Cambodians enter 
Vietnam, they are arrested, yet Vietnamese are flowing into 
Cambodia on a daily basis. During the election year there was a 
perceptible decrease in Vietnamese immigration. Since then, 
more Vietnamese have been coming to Cambodia. One can see that 
there are Vietnamese everywhere. They clog up our rivers and 
cities. How are you -- along with the current Royal Government 
-- going to solve this problem? 
  [Sihanouk] I have said virtually everything about the 
roundtable. There is no need to elaborate and I have nothing to 
add to what I already said. Now let us consider the second 
question; that is, the question of the Vietnamese immigrants, 
whether legal or illegal. 
  It is difficult to tell for sure how many Vietnamese are in 
Cambodia. If we ask our leaders, they say there are only about 
30,000-40,000 ethnic Vietnamese. Others -- those who are not in 
power -- put the number at some 2 million. Some would say 
500,000 and others 50,000. I do not know what the real number 
is. In the Royal Palace, we do not have a department capable of 
counting -- of investigating -- the Vietnamese. 
  I have one of my cousins here, H.E. Buor Herl, who has 
always 
served me and who is an authority on Cambodia. He comes from 
abroad. He is not one of the local businessmen. He saw me in 
Cambodia and expressed his wish to come and serve me again. I 
am going to assign him to investigate this issue. He is not 
going to take a census of all the Vietnamese in Cambodia. That 
would be an impossible task; some areas are impenetrable because 
of poor security. 
  Please come here, Excellency Herl. His father, Buor Hong, 
was a freedom fighter against the French colonialists. He was 
jailed and exiled by the French. His has always been a family 
of freedom fighters. Herl himself fought against the 
Vietnamese, right? It was during the time when the ANKI 
[National Army of Independent Cambodia], KPNLAF [Khmer National 
Liberation Armed Forces], and even the Khmer Rouge joined hands 
against the Vietnamese. So his credentials are good; he is 
certainly not pro-Vietnamese. How about your wife? She is a 
pure blooded Cambodian, is she not? [laughter] 
  If she were Vietnamese, it might would be difficult to 
conduct the investigation. By the way, do you have a Vietnamese 
girlfriend? No? [laughter] 
  I have a joke. It is about H.E. Um Manorin [Princess 
Monique's stepbrother] over there. He used to have a Vietnamese 
girlfriend. His wife went after that poor girl, smashing all her 
pots and pans and banishing her back to Vietnam. Was it your 
wife who sent her packing? Oh, it was Ku Run [police chief]? I 
heard that she lost a few of her teeth. If you meet her now, I 
think her face would not be pleasant to see. [laughter] 
  I believe you are more nationalist now, and maybe you have 
stopped dreaming about Vietnamese starlets. 
  So let us all put our heads together and think about how to 
deal with the Vietnamese immigrants. More and more are coming 
every day. Where should we begin the investigation? How many 
are at Neak Luong? [murmuring] 
  Yes, but Neak Luong has always been known as Saigon Moi. It 
was known as New Saigon even under Lon Nol. It is not easy to 
know for sure. 
  Let me tell all of you that the state has a hard time 
dealing 
with some aspects of this issue. There are Vietnamese who fled 
Khmer Rouge persecution and are now trying to return by boat 
because Vietnam does not recognize them as its own citizens and 
wants them to return. They are massing at the border. The 
state is not allowing in for fear of annoying our Cambodian 
people. There are many boats at the border, and international 
humanitarian organizations have to feed these people at our 
country's expense. These organizations are based in Cambodia and 
are supposed to feed starving Cambodians. Now they are feeding 
these Vietnamese instead. These organizations include FAO [UN 
Food and Agriculture Organization], UNICEF, and others. They 
are not supposed to assist Vietnamese people in Vietnam, but 
they are doing just that for the Vietnamese stranded at the 
border, unwanted by both Vietnam and Cambodia. This is one 
group. 
  Another group is formed by those who have come into Cambodia 
by various routes and claim that our soldiers and police are 
corrupt. No, I am not accusing my children who are soldiers and 
police of corruption. It is a fact that our authorities cannot 
stop them because our border demarcation is not as clear as in 
the past. Under Sangkum Reas Niyum, the border was clearly 
demarcated. Now it is different. Vietnam might have secretly 
moved the border deep into our territory. Many of the 
Vietnamese in our country can still claim to be in Vietnam 
because the border markers have been replanted inside Cambodia. 
Therefore, the governments in Phnom Penh and Hanoi must hold 
talks to demarcate the border clearly. 
  As far as the ethnic Vietnamese in the interior of the 
country are concerned, they enjoy almost excessive protection by 
the West. They contend they are the offspring of Vietnamese 
immigrants who came to Cambodia when King Sihanouk was young. 
They say these Vietnamese existed when King Sihanouk was king 
previously and when the French were here, before Cambodia was 
independent. The present-day Vietnamese, therefore, are the 
great grandchildren of these Vietnamese immigrants. As such, 
they have the right to live in Cambodia. This is what has been 
written in the Western press, showing that the West is siding 
with the ethnic Vietnamese. 
  [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Then there are the 
Vietnamese who have Cambodian citizenship acquired under the 
previous administration on the grounds that they had lived for 
an extended period of time in Cambodia or were born in Cambodia. 
  Those Vietnamese who have proof that their ancestors lived 
in 
Cambodia, or who hold Cambodian identity cards given by the 
State of Cambodia because they were born in Cambodia, lived in 
Cambodia for many years, and know the Cambodian language and 
literature, will not be driven out. This is because Cambodians 
living in France, the United States, Germany, and other 
countries have acquired citizenship in their host countries. If 
Cambodians in, say, Canada can get Canadian citizenship, how can 
we be harsh with the Vietnamese in our country? If we insist, 
we would be accused of infringing on the principles of human 
rights. This matter is quite touchy. Nevertheless, we have the 
right to deport back to Vietnam those who have immigrated 
illegally, including prostitutes of all descriptions. We can do 
that. The government should check out the illegal immigrants -- 
be they farmers or traders -- and deport them. We can tell them 
they are not permitted to live in Cambodia and we invite them to 
return to their own country. We can do this because illegal 
immigrants of all nationalities, including Cambodians, in France 
and other countries who do not have proper residency cards are 
driven out of those countries. 
  So here is my answer to your question: 
  1. Any Vietnamese having proof that his ancestors lived in 
Cambodia in the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's, or 1960's -- that he is 
their great grandchild -- will be allowed to live in Cambodia 
because he is a Cambodian. 
  2. Any Vietnamese who legally acquired citizenship under the 
ruling State of Cambodia on the grounds that he was born in 
Cambodia or lived in Cambodia for many years and could speak, 
read, and write Cambodian well will not be asked to leave. We 
have no legal grounds to deport this category of Vietnamese. 
  We have the right to send back other Vietnamese, though -- 
any Vietnamese who have illegally immigrated into Cambodia and 
have not received official permission from the previous 
administration or the current government. We will politely ask 
them to leave. We invite them to leave. We must check for this 
type of Vietnamese. Some areas are not safe to go and check for 
these Vietnamese, but I believe that the areas controlled by the 
Khmer Rouge need not be checked because the Khmer Rouge would 
not allow any Vietnamese to remain alive there. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Your Majesty announced that Khieu Samphan 
had 
asked you to leave Phnom Penh. The people were very alarmed. 
Do you have anything to say to calm their fears? Another thing 
is that we would like to see a cease-fire in place first before 
a roundtable is held. 
  [Sihanouk] This is a good question. I have to tell you that 
I still require more cancer treatment in China, and President 
Jiang 
  Zemin has invited me on a three-day state visit before I 
undergo further medical treatment. If need be, however -- if 
the people need my presence in the country -- I might postpone 
my cancer treatment in China or I might have my cancer treated 
here so I can stay in Cambodia. But my wife wants to see me 
undergo the treatment because she does not want to be a widow 
soon. Despite all my brave words to the contrary, I am more or 
less of a henpecked husband. [passage omitted] 
  Now let us talk about the roundtable. It is not right to ask 
the Khmer Rouge to observe a cease-fire first; both sides must 
stop fighting equally. Then we can proceed to the roundtable in 
Cambodia. But Khieu Samphan does not want a roundtable in 
Cambodia. What is your opinion; what is your suggestion if Khieu 
Samphan does not want to hold it here? This problem is 
important. All of you should help solve it. 
  [Correspondent] I am the director of the SAMLENG POLROAT 
KHMER newspaper. My respects to Your Majesty. It is my opinion 
that both sides should listen to Your Majesty's proposal. Khieu 
Samphan's side should stop fighting and so should the people on 
this side. Both sides should find the solution to our problem 
together. 
  [Sihanouk] Thank you. I would like to inform you all that at 
1730 this afternoon I will meet with Samdech Ranaridddh and 
Samdech Hun Sen. I will ask them point blank whether or not 
they agree to a cease-fire. I suggest that the cease-fire 
should be bilateral and observed equally by both sides. The 
roundtable will be held in the Damnak Chan Pavilion, and H.E. 
Khieu Samphan will be asked to join. We will do that, if you do 
not disagree. I will do that this afternoon. If the two 
samdeches agree, I will fax a letter to Khieu Samphan and ask 
him whether or not he agree if the other side has already 
agreed. Both sides will be asked to send their generals to form 
a committee under my chairmanship to oversee the cease-fire. 
After the cease-fire is in place, Mr. Khieu Samphan will be 
invited to join a roundtable to solve the problem for the 
people. If this problem cannot be solved, each side will be 
held responsible before history and the people. If you do not 
disagree, I will do just that. [passage omitted] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am the deputy editor of the 
SAKAL newspaper. According to news reports, the Royal 
Government will reject the Khmer Rouge because they refused to 
join the roundtable on 2 May. If this is the case, how will the 
Royal Government solve the peace problem in Cambodia and what 
means will it use to do so? 
  [Sihanouk] Thank you. This is an important question, but I 
have already answered it in detail. Khieu Samphan refused to 
come to Phnom Penh, saying that his security was not ensured. 
He wants to go abroad. First he said that if his security was 
assured he would come. Now he says no even though he was given 
permission to stay in the Royal Palace. Maybe this is because 
he is winning battles. Maybe because he is winning he is 
looking for excuses not to hold a roundtable. This is only a 
guess. If we want to corner him, we should agree to go to 
Paris. But the children on this side say it would not be 
practical to go to Paris. If all the leaders go to Paris, what 
would happen here? Who would take care of affairs at home? 
There would be anarchy. I agree with the children on this 
side. If we go to Paris, it would be difficult to control the 
situation and the fighting at home. Another thing is that it 
would not be nice to look at. This does not mean I am siding 
with the three samdeches. It would be an ugly prospect. There 
would be no end to the problems and it would be most impractical 
to resort to foreign venues all the time. Why can we not meet 
at home? It is proper and sufficient to meet in the Royal 
Palace. Khieu Samphan should agree to come and join the 
roundtable here so that all the suspicions can be cleared and 
everyone can see for sure who is right and who is wrong. We 
should meet and discuss things once and for all. Each 
negotiator will be grilled by the media so that the nation, the 
international community, and history can see who is right and 
who is wrong. [words indistinct] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Kim Ho-sam: "Unjust and </F>
Unreasonable Act"] 
  [Text] The insurance of durable peace on the Korean 
peninsula has been raised as a vital issue which should not be 
delayed any longer. 
  The DPRK Foreign Ministry on 28 April announced a statement 
pertaining to this issue, and proposed to the U.S. side that 
negotiations be held between the DPRK and the United States in 
order to replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace 
agreement and to provide a new peace insurance system, replacing 
the present Korean armistice organization which cannot play any 
role in preventing a war. 
  This is a most reasonable proposal for preventing a new war 
from occurring on the Korean peninsula on which the situation is 
strained to an extreme pitch [kuktoro kinjangdoeo innun] and for 
insuring durable peace. Therefore, fair public opinion of the 
world actively welcomed this. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities, interfering in 
our reasonable proposal, are attempting to disturb it. 
  According to a report, the South Korean authorities on 3 May 
said that our proposal for DPRK-U.S. negotiations on replacing 
the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement should be 
discussed by the North and the South through direct talks after 
the nuclear problem of the North is completely resolved. They 
noted that they will reveal the government position at a meeting 
of the unification and security policy adjustment council and 
will inform the United Nations and the United States of the 
position. 
  In an informal talk with reporters that day, the puppet 
foreign minister, claiming that the issue of a peace agreement 
is not the issue to be negotiated between our Republic and the 
United States, said that even if this issue is discussed at a 
third round of DPRK- U.S. talks, it will not be adopted as an 
agenda item. 
  Such remarks by the South Korean authorities reveal their 
insidious attempt to hinder negotiations between us and the 
United States over the issue of insuring everlasting peace on 
the Korean peninsula from being realized and to interfere in and 
disturb the negotiations. 
  As everyone knows, the armistice status has lasted over 40 
years in Korea. This is indeed an abnormal situation. During 
this period, our Republic put forward various reasonable 
proposals and initiatives with a view to preventing a new war by 
all means from occurring in Korea, and made all efforts to 
achieve them. 
  However, the United States, going counter to this, 
systematically abrogated [chegyejoguro pagihaewatta] what were 
agreed on in the Armistice Agreement. The United States brought 
modern lethal weapons into South Korea in a concealed manner in 
the past. However, it is now openly introducing new missiles in 
broad daylight. 
  Because of this, the Korean Armistice Agreement has been 
reduced to a scrap of paper incapable of insuring peace on the 
Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] 
has become only a nominal organization practically with no 
masters. 
  Under this very situation, our Republic proposed this time 
for negotiations with the United States with a view to 
establishing a new peace insurance system on the Korean 
peninsula. However, the South Korean puppets are attempting to 
interfere in this presumptuously. 
  This is a totally unreasonable act not only in view of 
international laws but also from the standpoint of the very 
parties that signed the Armistice Agreement. As everyone knows, 
in view of international laws, the armistice means a temporary 
suspension of combat action, not a total peace. Therefore, a 
peace agreement should be concluded between the parties in 
hostilities so that unstable peace be turned into total peace. 
  Only our Republic and the U.S. side are eligible to conclude 
a peace agreement in our country. This is because the Korean 
Armistice Agreement was signed between the two parties with the 
Korean People's Army [KPA] and the Chinese People's Volunteers 
[CPV] as one side and the UN Forces as the other. In addition, 
who represented the side of the KPA and CPV at that time was our 
Republic and who represented the UN Forces side was the United 
States. 
  The very parties that concluded the Korean Armistice 
Agreement are our Republic and the United States and those who 
signed the Agreement are none other than our Republic and the 
United States. Thus, it is not necessary even to mention that 
the South Korean authorities have no justification whatsoever to 
interfere in this. 
  Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are raving about 
the issue of measures for a peace agreement on the Korean 
peninsula, and so forth. This is indeed a laughable act going 
counter to common sense. 
  Such an unreasonable act by the South Korean puppets again 
proves that they are not interested in peace on the Korean 
peninsula and reunification of the nation even to a slightest 
degree but are pursuing only division and war by disturbing 
DPRK-U.S. negotiations and talks. 
  The South Korean authorities should not run wild without 
sensing where they can stand and where they can sit but act with 
discretion. Their reckless act will only invoke denunciation and 
mockery of fair public opinion of the world.

  [Text] Regarding the news report that the United States 
has issued warrants for the arrest of Thais, including a member 
of the House of Representatives, on charges of narcotics 
trafficking, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that Thailand 
will have to wait for further information from the United States 
because no charges have been clearly stated so far. He said 
that if the case is confirmed, it will be the duty of the 
persons concerned to give explanations. 
  [Begin recording] [Chuan] According to the information 
received on past events, the issue is connected with what 
happened several years ago. An American was arrested on a charge 
of narcotics trafficking. The suspect confessed and said that 
he bought the drugs from Thais. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you mean he referred to Thais? 
  [Chuan] He referred to Thais. The U.S. narcotics suppression 
authorities requested our Office of Narcotics Control Board 
[ONCB] to check the assets of those Thais. Therefore, I assume 
this issue would be in consequence with the said incident. Now, 
we have to wait for additional information or report that the 
United States will provide for us. As of now, nothing has been 
confirmed nor denied. 
  [Reporter] Did the American suspect give the names? 
  [Chuan] Yes, he gave the names. 
  [Reporter] One name or many? 
  [Chuan] Thai names were stated. I think more than one, but I 
am not sure how many. The suspect also said the operations had 
been carried out for many years. 
  [Reporter] [Question indistinct] 
  [Chuan] Nothing. No charges have been clearly stated yet. 
It is the event in the United States, and no clear details have 
been sent to us. We have only known from news reports. 
  [Reporter] But now the Thai Parliament [words indistinct]. 
  [Chuan] We must follow up on it. If it involves individuals 
or there is any confirmation, then it will be the duty of those 
persons involved to give explanations. 
  [Reporter] What has the ONCB been authorized to do, because 
this matter also affectes the image of Thailand? 
  [Chuan] The ONCB is following up on it to get more 
information. Right now we cannot give any more details than what 
we have received. [end recording]

  [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The Japanese Fuji-TV Seoul 
bureau chief, who has been sentenced to a suspended prison term 
for violating the military secret protection law, was deported 
from Korea on last April 28, a Justice Ministry official said 
Wednesday. 
  The Japanese journalist, Masatoshi Sinohara, has drawn two 
years in prison with a stay of execution for three years. The 
appellate court verdict was confirmed as he did not appeal. 
  "Under the immigration law, those foreigners sentenced to 
prison terms are supposed to be deported. We have also banned 
him from visiting Korea for the next five years," the Ministry 
official said.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexander Nicoll: "Identity Crisis for Asian </F>
Development Bank"] 
  [Text] What should a regional development bank do when its 
region has become--at least partly--developed? 
  The question has occurred to the governments which support 
the Asian Development Bank [ADB] with taxpayers' money. Many 
industrialised countries feel that, since borrowers have growing 
resources and access to private capital, the ADB should focus on 
alleviating social problems -- for example, reducing poverty and 
improving the environment. 
  Zealous championing of this issue, particularly by the 
United 
States, has dominated the ritual discussions over a capital 
increase for the ADB over the past two years and has upset some 
Asian countries even if they broadly agree with the US arguments. 
  An even broader questioning of the modern role of 
international development banks came from Sir William Ryrie, 
former head of the World Bank's private sector arm, the 
International Finance Corporation, and now a director of 
Barings, the merchant bank, during a seminar at the ADB's annual 
meeting in Nice. 
  Massive private investment pouring into economies which were 
increasingly market-oriented had made official lending, he said, 
"less necessary and sometimes undesirable". Official lending 
could retard development of private markets by introducing 
capital which was not subject to the same risk discipline as 
private money. Development banks should lend to governments for 
sound projects only when the private sector would not meet the 
need. 
  Though the debate about a capital increase is virtually over 
-- negotiations have been completed and ADB governors must vote 
on a doubling by May 22 -- discussion of the ADB's function 
continues to swirl. 
  The bank's new president, Mr Mitsuo Sato, faces a big 
challenge in implementing the new strategy set by shareholders 
while at the same time seeking to restore bruised dignities in 
an organisation which, in the Asian manner, has a strong 
tradition of operating by consensus. 
  Simply interpreting the new conditions which are being 
attached to the ADB's lending will be difficult. About half of 
lending from ordinary capital resources (separate from soft 
loans) is to be devoted to social-sector lending. Instead of 
just financing a road, the ADB should now ensure that the road 
is of particular benefit to poor communities, or for example 
that the borrowing government charges appropriate fees to trucks 
to limit environmental damage. 
  Most sensitive is a demand by donor countries that loans be 
linked to "good governance" -- a phrase with political overtones 
which alarm many borrowing countries, particularly those with 
memories of past colonialism. 
  Mr Gunther Schulz, an ADB vice-president, says: "We feel as 
a 
bank that we can only use this term in an economic context, not 
a political context". 
  ABD officials concede, however, that not all donor countries 
agree with this interpretation. "How can we judge human rights 
in a country?" asked one. "We are not Amnesty International. 
We do not have the tools." 
  Mr P.K. Lahiri, Indian executive director of the bank, said 
India, while supporting the capital increase, had reservations 
about its linkage to policy and operational guidelines. 
  India and China also feel that if a high proportion of 
ordinary ADB lending is to be devoted to social sector concerns, 
then they -- the borrowing countries with social problems on the 
biggest scale -- should have access to concessional loans from 
the Asian Development Fund [ADF] which are naturally targeted at 
such problems. India and China are denied access to the ADF on 
the grounds that their sheer size would swamp the fund's 
resources. 
  The changes in policy take place just as the ADB is in any 
case tightening up its practices so that loans are better 
prepared and monitored. The bank has admitted that it suffered 
from an "approvals culture" in which the primary concern was to 
pump out loans rather than the quality of projects -- though it 
does not feel the performance record of projects it has financed 
is any worse than that of other similar lenders. 
  ADB executives insist the bank still does have a valuable 
role to play. Mr Sato told the annual meeting yesterday the 
bank's regional presence acts an an incentive to others "to 
participate in a broad-based portfolio of investment for 
sustainable development". 
  Mr Schulz said the bank will be much more selective in 
future 
lending and that it should not compete with the private sector. 
He said the bank could act as a catalyst by taking small stakes 
in, for example, big infrastructural projects, and could also 
assist longer-term development by financing education and health. 
  Donor countries will be closely watching the ADB over the 
next two years as they discuss the next replenishment of the ADF 
-- negotiations which, given the present debate, promise to be 
difficult.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Hirohiko Okumura, research director at Nomura </F>
General Institute; Kazuo Ogura, former director general of the 
Economic Affairs Bureau, Foreign Ministry; and Yasuhiko 
Nakamura, NHK commentator, on 7 March 1994; place not given] 
  [Text] It Is Like Both Sides of the Moon 
  [GAIKO FORUM] I would like you to look back over how the 
Uruguay Round of negotiations' conclusion came about and discuss 
the significance of the negotiations' conclusion. 
  [Ogura] I think there are three pillars to the Uruguay 
Round. 
The first is the necessity for some improvement in the world 
trade system, or systems and rules that have been practiced for 
30 or years following the end of World War II. Dumping is a 
typical example. 
  The second is an inquiry made into a field where there have 
been no rules, or into a field where the making of rules has 
been too difficult to accomplish despite the desirability of 
having rules. One is, of course, the problem of agriculture and 
the other is the problem of voluntary restraints on exports 
centering on textiles. 
  It is not that there have been no rules governing 
agricultural trade, but the rules themselves have been ambiguous 
and agricultural subsidies have been approved by GATT. There 
have been no great restrictions and rules governing voluntary 
restraints on exports have not been very explicit. Calling that 
a loophole is a little too strong, but those problems have been 
difficult to handle. 
  The third, intellectual property rights, is a great 
achievement of the Uruguay Round. It is a new field that has 
barely been covered by the GATT system or other world trade 
rules. Of course, there have been various rules governing 
intellectual property rights or patent rights themselves, but 
these rules have not necessarily been explicit in their 
connection with trade. The question is how to make rules to 
govern such a new field. 
  Some said there was discussion about the idea of the GATT 
system developing a fourth great pillar in addition to those 
mentioned above; I think there is no mistake about it. For 
example, a new world trade agency, the World Trade Organization 
[WTO], is going to be established. 
  Despite all that, what generally has not been understood has 
been international rulemaking. Rulemaking means an improvement 
of existing rules in a particular field; or making rules in a 
field where there have not been many rules; or making rules in a 
field where people have wanted to make rules, but have been 
unable to do so; or making new rules in an entirely new field. 
Of course, since the Uruguay Round dealt with negotiations, 
there are other problems in addition to rulemaking. 
  Therefore, the Uruguay Round is like the front and back of 
the moon; seen from the front, it was rulemaking; seen from the 
back, it was an adjustment of economic interests because there 
were economic and political interests and motives among three 
groups--the United States and the European Community, Japan, and 
the least developed countries. Speaking from a political 
standpoint, originally there may have been a motive for the 
unity of the West, or a motive for opposition to regionalism. 
And there may have been a motive for drawing the least 
developed countries into the world trade system. 
  It is inevitable for the persons who participated in the 
negotiations to think that their primary concern was rulemaking. 
If the negotiations are viewed from a distance as political 
scientists and economists do, it will be interesting to know 
what the interests and motives were, to what kind of 
negotiations these interests and motives led and under what 
circumstances; and it will be necessary to analyze these matters. 
  [Okumura] These problems of trade and other international 
transactions have something to do with the necessity of 
implementing a change in the industrial structure, the method of 
conducting business, and business strategy on the basis of the 
principle of relative superiority in principle. Since this is a 
kind of change of systems, there will be a fight between a small 
number of people who have gained great profits under the past 
system and a large number of people who will gain a little 
profit under a new system. Any change in systems involves 
tremendous effort, and it is only natural that it took a long 
time to implement the current change. A system which can be 
changed in an instant is not a great system. As you have 
pointed out, this time we have had a great change in systems and 
rules in three fields. What made this possible is the fact that 
the process of the world economy's unification has been behind 
the international trade transactions, which bred political 
dynamics for a change in systems within each country. That, in 
turn, made it easier to persuade a small number of people who 
profited under the past system. 
  Various negotiations were conducted under the Uruguay Round 
from 1986 to 1993. Looking back over what happened to the world 
economy, we find that direct investment made rapid progress on a 
historical scale. The second is the movement of capital, the 
amount of which increased to an unprecedented degree. The third 
is the fact that the exchange rate was forced to undergo a very 
great adjustment in connection with the movement of capital. 
The fourth is international policy cooperation, whose 
evaluation may differ, depending upon one's position. However, 
despite various problems, the effort to continue policy 
cooperation has been carried on to this day, which shows the 
true worth of policy cooperation. I would like to think that 
the Uruguay Round has come to a successful conclusion under such 
circumstances. An adjustment has been made so established 
domestic rules can be changed into international rules. Japan 
has adopted rules that are thought to be the best for its 
country, but these were not found to be necessarily good rules 
for foreigners in the midst of the process of 
internationalization. That has resulted in an absolutely 
necessary adjustment. 
  [Nakamura] What Mr. Ogura has said about rulemaking is 
right. 
What did Japan gain most from the conclusion of the rulemaking? 
The protection of the free trade system. Japan said that to 
protect the free trade system, it must make a decision on rice 
which belongs to the agricultural field. 
  There is no mistake about the fact that the protection of 
the 
free trade system is the most important thing in a long-range 
view. However, the protection of the free trade system is an 
abstract idea, and, even though other regions or other countries 
have clearly profited from that protection, it is not so easy 
for Japan to understand it. If one says that it is not so easy 
to understand it because it involves rule making, that would be 
the end of it. 
  The conclusion of the negotiations may bring about some 
results. For example, the United States may profit in the field 
of intellectual property rights. IBM, for one, may gain a 
certain amount of profit in software trade. As for France, it 
was originally supposed that France would be asked to reduce the 
export subsidy for agricultural products by as much as 24 
percent. However, it turned out that they got off with a 
21-percent reduction. And it was decided that the United States 
should impose tariffs on certain waiver items. For those 
concerned countries that are capable of exporting these items, 
it may become possible for them to export these items to a 
certain degree by overcoming the barrier of tariffication. 
  However, Japan knows that it could contribute to the 
protection of the free trade system, but it does not know the 
rest very well. That may be due to the lack of explanation by 
the government. It is difficult for ordinary people to 
understand: "In truth, the result will be the same in each 
individual case. This is a better solution." In making a 
speech, I can say: "The current situation is much better than 
what it would have been if the negotiations had gone wrong and 
had broken down." However, I cannot say very much beyond that. 
  Reference has been made to the Uruguay Round and its impact 
on Japan's economy. I do not think there was much joy in the 
industrial community, at business job sites, or in the financial 
market because of the conclusion of the negotiations. The 
Japanese economy is undergoing hard times after the collapse of 
the bubble, so its mid-range project can cover only three years. 
However, the Uruguay Round will not bear fruit quickly, but will 
do so only gradually, taking five to 10 years. In that sense, 
the Uruguay Round is not something eye-opening to Japan. 
  Although we do not currently applaud the Uruguay Round with 
hand clapping, when we enter the latter half of 1990's after the 
adjustment of the bubble's collapse, the Uruguay Round will 
contribute to the enlargement of the world economy and world 
trade, and the Japanese economy will be making satisfactory 
development under the Uruguay Round. Such an understanding will 
probably be accepted later, but currently it is not much in 
vogue here in Japan. 
  [Nakamura] Concerning the agricultural field, which faced 
rough going at the last stage of the negotiations, Japan is 
conscious of the fact that it made a considerable concession in 
opening its market to foreign rice--even if the opening of the 
market is only partial. Foreign countries, on the other hand, 
may feel that they have bestowed a considerable favor on Japan 
on the grounds that they have provided such a special measure 
only for Japan and South Korea. There is a great imbalance of 
perception between Japan and other countries in that respect. 
  [Ogura] There may have been such an aspect to some extent. 
However, there are several reasons, one of which is that Japan 
has a current accounts surplus. Practically speaking, it is 
politically very difficult for Japan to say that unless it gains 
such and such a thing, it will not participate in the 
negotiations. Meanwhile, the United States and Europe want to 
take such and such a thing, and they have to say with great 
emphasis that they must take such and such a thing to persuade 
their own countries. Actually the EC as a whole is running a 
deficit with Japan, and it has recently had a trade deficit with 
the United States. There is also a problem with newly 
industrialized countries. 
  Japan had wanted to say, "What will Japan gain from the 
success of the Uruguay Round?," but if Japan had brought that 
matter up for negotiation, it would have been improper. 
However, I think that Japan should have made its share in the 
agricultural field clear, instead of saying: "The partial 
opening of the rice market was all right because profits can be 
made in the field of industrial products." "The free trade 
system has been preserved." We should have had more discussion 
in our country. 
  However, if we had pursued this line of thinking, we would 
have been obliged to adopt "a struggle on certain conditions." 
However, in the case of the rice problem, Japan could not 
politically engage in such a struggle from the beginning. The 
general public was of the opinion that Japan would be absolutely 
opposed to the partial opening to the end; or that was a 
political reality. But as Mr. Nakamura has said, if we take 
such and such a thing because it brings us such and such a 
profit--in short, taking something corresponds to giving 
something--that constitutes a struggle on certain conditions. I 
wonder if Japan could engaged in such a struggle in the field of 
agriculture. 
  I have a feeling that Japan should have begun the 
negotiations a little earlier. Since Japan imports a large 
quantity of agricultural products such as food, it had 
bargaining power. We should have made good use of it. However, 
great restrictions would probably have been imposed if Japan had 
tried to exercised such bargaining power in the Uruguay Round 
negotiations. 
  [Nakamura] For one thing, Japan was superficially 
optimistic about agriculture when the Uruguay Round began in 
1986. Despite the fact that for some reason or other, Japan did 
not at first clearly declare its intentions that "Japan's stance 
on the agricultural field is like this," it suddenly began to 
say "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan as far as 
agriculture is concerned." Since Japan did not mention this 
when the negotiations began, I do not think that it could 
explain its position internationally. Moreover, a Diet 
resolution took place during the negotiations. It is impossible 
to have a resolution without a dissenting voice on this kind of 
problem, and such a resolution does not restrain the decision of 
the government. Despite that, too much emphasis was placed on 
the resolution even at the end of the negotiations. It was very 
unfortunate that behind-the-scenes negotiations had to be 
conducted on the basis of that resolution. Therefore, Japan 
should have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions on the 
way however complicated the matter became within Japan. In 
return for that, Japan should have accurately explained its 
position that "this is the maximum permissible limit for Japan," 
and then it should have conducted discussions with the process 
of diplomatic negotiations open to some extent. 
  The tariffication of rice is to be postponed for six years, 
but I wonder what the result will be. The amount of minimum 
access six years after the postponement is 800,000 tons, which 
is a considerable amount. Such a consideration makes one think 
that tariffication from the beginning would have been better. 
Then the minimum access of 5 percent will suffice six years 
after the postponement. The tariff rate six years after the 
postponement will become quite high. Even if we had set the 
tariff rate high at the time of the negotiations' final 
conclusion, that would have been internationally acceptable. 
The negotiations' conclusion that makes one think that 
tariffication from the beginning would have better is 
unfortunate. 
<H5>  Japan's Negotiations Began With Food Security </H5>
  [Ogura] As a line of thinking, Mr. Nakamura has said that we 
could have engaged in a struggle upon certain conditions. After 
all, GATT is ultimately negotiations in the interest of 
exporting countries. Of course, importing countries have 
various interests, and they have the right to speak in 
rulemaking concerning the problem of dumping, for example. 
However, the negotiations card is held overwhelmingly by 
exporting countries. 
  Under the GATT system, primary negotiating power is 
traditionally given to the main supplying countries. 
Negotiations are realized when there are exports between 
countries, so negotiations are out of the question when 
agricultural products are not exported. It is worthwhile to 
listen to the opinion that we should have engaged in a struggle 
upon certain conditions earlier. One of the problems with that 
opinion is whether it was really advantageous for Japan to 
engage in a struggle upon certain conditions, leaving Japan's 
agriculture situation of importing agricultural products as it 
was. As an extreme case, Japan should think of further 
enhancing the added value of agricultural products economically 
and rationally to export them, although I do not mean to say 
that the government should provide export subsidies; otherwise, 
under the existing circumstances, Japan will not be able to 
enter into international negotiations concerning agriculture. 
  Another thing is what Japan said when it first raised the 
problem of rice: it was not the environment, but food security, 
which is not only an economic theory, but social psychology and 
a kind of political theory. In short, a certain degree of 
supply and demand and the maintenance of the food control system 
are already included in food security as a tacit premise. Since 
Japan entered into the negotiations on the basis of a food 
security theory, it could not assume a quite different 
negotiating attitude later. 
  It is possible to discuss what was most advantageous to 
Japan 
from a purely economic viewpoint when calculations were 
made--minimum access of 5 percent or minimum access of 8 
percent, for example. However, it is a little doubtful whether 
such a discussion was meaningful in actual negotiations. 
Therefore, opinions may differ as to what kind of negotiation 
was possible for Japan. 
  However, since Japan entered into the negotiations on the 
basis of a food security theory, it had to bid at that point, so 
to speak. If Japan had entered into the negotiations on a basis 
other than a food security theory, it could have argued for 
comprehensive tariffication instead of the choice it had made. 
However, since Japan started from the position--"Food security 
is everything. Japan will preserve the food control system," it 
set a limit on its solution of the matter, although that limit 
was not clear. 
  [Nakamura] Preservation of the food control system is 
only a temporary measure; tariffication of rice will be 
inevitable in six years. Japan should discontinue what it has 
undertaken. If the present situation continues for six years, 
there will be tariffication. Since there will be no minimum 
access then, there is no knowing if the current food control 
system can be preserved. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
and Fisheries will say that the food control system can be 
maintained since national trade is recognized. However, I do 
not think that rice producers will gain vigor under the present 
circumstances. Such a situation is not very conducive to 
Japan's agriculture as a whole. 
  Japan is already a country established on the basis of trade 
and is also an advanced industrialized nation. The question is 
what to do with agriculture in such a situation. Furthermore, 
Japan still holds inefficient sectors and cannot neglect them 
since its political power is still very strong on the surface. 
Nevertheless, Japan must grow on the basis of behavior 
befitting an advanced industrialized nation, while it is obliged 
to say "agriculture is very important." I am very sorry that 
the negotiations were conducted under such a situation. 
  [Okumura] Japan's agriculture is now very weak in 
international competitiveness. There are various reasons for 
its weakness. For example, the exchange rate has undergone a 
successive change -- 360 yen, 240 yen, and 120 yen; Japan's 
agricultural production costs suddenly become high in terms of 
labor costs and the current exchange rate. This does not 
necessarily mean that Japanese farmers are lazy. We must spend 
time and use a careful strategy to improve agriculture. I know 
that it would have been better if we had entered into the 
negotiations with an agricultural policy on our part, but now it 
is useless to say so. We must improve the competitiveness of 
Japan's agriculture by means of a careful strategy for some 
years to come. It is very difficult to decide whether we should 
improve competitiveness while rice is being partially 
liberalized or while a high tariff with a high rate of 
transparency is being imposed on rice. 
  [Ogura] One method is to improve competitiveness while the 
measure of minimum access is being taken as it is now. 
  Therefore, I do not necessarily think it a good choice to 
continue a price competition for some years to come. An 
important prior condition, however, is to implement a policy to 
improve competitiveness during that period. 
  [Nakamura] The most important thing to do is to thoroughly 
discuss again what the Uruguay Round's conclusion was all about 
as far as agricultural policy is concerned. The past 
agricultural policy as a whole is now being questioned. 
  [Okumura] If some agricultural sectors are liberalized 
through deregulation, the prices of raw materials will be 
reduced by one-fourth for consumers and producers, and high 
value-added products with international competitiveness will be 
made. The presence of regulations, however, makes the prices of 
raw materials unusually high, which makes it impossible to make 
high value-added products. Such agricultural sectors exist, 
therefore, the government should turn to deregulation so that 
those sectors can have an international competitive edge, 
instead of maintaining regulations for protection. 
  [Nakamura] The food industry is dissatisfied with the 
recent conclusion. The tariffication of butter and powdered 
skim milk, for example, has not made them very cheap. The price 
of sugar is the same as it has been. Candy makers say: "Raw 
materials are very expensive and we cannot compete with European 
products at such prices." We should at least say to such 
people, "Please be patient for six or 10 years, because the 
competitiveness of agriculture has been weak." "We will do our 
best after that." Unless we do that, consumer prices will be 
influenced. In truth, the recent conclusion ignored consumers 
in the agricultural field. It is necessary for the agricultural 
people to acknowledged "that fact" and act accordingly. 
  However, instead of procrastinating, we should have made 
more 
requests to Europe and the United States, saying: "We will 
accept tariffication, in return for which, you too...," by 
playing our strongest card, tariffication. For the past few 
years, the opinion has been held that food security could be 
accomplished so long as the opening of rice markets was 
prevented. For the future, however, we should ask ourselves 
what food security really means and think of food security as a 
whole without confining our concern to rice only. 
  [Ogura] Both the United States and Europe had their own 
agricultural policies. The framework of the Common Agricultural 
Policy, a famous European agriculture reform policy, had already 
been made. The task of Europe was how to tide over the Uruguay 
Round negotiations within the framework of that policy. The 
United States had a new agricultural policy based on the 
Agricultural Law of 1985, which led to the security of incomes. 
The United States wanted world trade rules to go along with its 
agricultural policy. 
  However, did Japan really have an agricultural policy prior 
to the negotiations? Is it not true that, because of the 
Uruguay Round, Japan delayed working out an agricultural policy 
or an agricultural policy vision? If there had been a new 
agricultural policy vision 10 years before and the Uruguay Round 
negotiations had been conducted accordingly, the situation would 
have been different. 
  [Nakamura] That is right. Japan could have said like Europe, 
"That is our framework." This time Japan could not say, "This 
is our limit." 
<H5>  Momentum Was Given by the Tokyo Summit </H5>
  [Nakamura] What led the Uruguay Round negotiations, which 
had had difficult sailing, to a successful conclusion at the end 
of last year? I have a feeling that the conclusion came 
suddenly. 
  [Ogura] Well, in a word, what moved international politics 
ultimately is time, that is, a time limit. In short, the 
successful conclusion was due to the schedule that stipulated 
that a conclusion must be reached by 15 December. Of course, 
there were schedules prior to that, but then it was possible to 
change the schedules politically. The reason was the demand of 
the U.S. Congress for a fast-track decision on the measure. 
Europe was still in the process of its 1992 integration. Of 
course, all had a deadline in a way, but it was a goal, not a 
deadline in the true sense of the word which meant a catastrophe 
if it was not observed. This time the negotiators of the 
Uruguay Round drove themselves into a corner--to the brink of 
success or failure. 
  Another reason is that times were bad. Clearly, grave 
concern was aroused during the Tokyo summit in September: "It 
is not right if we cannot even bring the Uruguay Round to a 
successful conclusion in the face of such a recession." I have 
a feeling that such a mood had been growing steadily since last 
spring. 
  [Nakamura] The change in GATT directors general, from Dunkel 
to Sutherland, produced a certain amount of flexibility. An 
atmosphere was born in the secretariat which allowed it to 
decide to drop tasks that could not be accomplished despite a 
series of efforts--audiovisuals and U.S. marine transportation 
business, for example. 
  [Ogura] That is right. In looking back, we find that the 
Tokyo summit played an important role. At that time, I was a 
little doubtful about the effects on the Uruguay Round caused by 
the summit. Of course, the summit had an effect on the Uruguay 
Round, but, when the summit was over, I did not know whether 
such an effect could bring the Uruguay Round to a successful 
conclusion. In truth, the commitment of the world's prime 
ministers and presidents to the Uruguay Round was a very 
decisive element. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] I have the impression that the problems 
between 
Japan and the United States became complicated as soon as the 
Uruguay Round negotiations were concluded and establishment of 
the WTO was decided. 
  [Ogura] A very serious problem in the future will be 
cross-retaliation: When one country feels dissatisfied with the 
other in the trade of goods, it takes countermeasures against 
that country in the services sector; when one country has a 
complaint about the other in financial matters, it imposes 
restraints on the trade of goods. If a dispute arises about 
licenses such as intellectual property rights, the problem is 
how the dispute is settled when the WTO will be entwined with 
the unified procedures for settling disputes, procedures which 
have just been stipulated. The GATT has concerned itself 
primarily with goods. Now, however, intellectual property 
rights or services such as finance and maritime transportation 
have become important. For this reason, the method of settling 
disputes itself will become a very important problem 
internationally. At the same time, the problem of exchange 
rates will become important. 
  The average U.S. and Japanese tariff rate on industrial 
goods 
now stands at 3 to 5 percent. Thus, even if the 3-percent 
tariff rate is decreased by 30 percent, the average tariff 
rate--of 3 percent--will then fall to no more than about 2 
percent. What is the movement of exchange rates compared to 
that? The movement of tariff rates does not bear comparison to 
that of exchange rates. Ours is a world in which a fluctuation 
of 1 yen or 2 yen is a daily occurrence. At the time of the 
Tokyo summit, everyone asked me, "What is the value of a 
reduction of only 1 percent despite years of serious 
negotiations?" Since the time of the Tokyo summit, it has been 
decided that it is better to make business easier through 
harmonization, such as the elimination of nontariff barriers and 
business uncertainty, than to engage in talks to reduce tariff 
rates by such and such a percentage. Thus, a sector where the 
results cannot be expressed in terms of figures has been 
broadened and this time has come to include services and 
intellectual property rights. 
  In this way, the problems of the substance of trade 
negotiations have undergone a great change with the change of 
the world economy. To me, the big question is what type of form 
the next negotiations will take. 
  [Okumura] Negotiations on services have not been conducted 
under GATT. That has become possible starting with the recent 
negotiations. This means that a country which is strong in the 
service sector in terms of comparative advantage has gained an 
advantage over others. It will become possible for a country 
which is not strong in the production of goods, in terms of 
comparative advantage, to tide over difficulties, even if it 
encounters difficulties in the goods sector, as long as the 
liberalization of the services sector is further promoted. 
Because each country has its own strong and weak sectors 
according to its industrial structure, it has become impossible 
to conduct multilateral negotiations only in the goods sector 
without including collateral services. In that sense, the 
recent conclusion of the negotiations was inevitable. 
  Now, the next question is what kind of benefit will the 
recent conclusion confer on the world economy. According to the 
calculations of the GATT Secretariat and the OECD, the volume of 
trade will be increased by 10 percent 10 years from now. 
However, when the development of the economy for the next 10 
years is considered, policy adjustments and the stability of 
exchange rates will have a much greater impact. In short, it is 
impossible to say that the recent conclusion of the negotiations 
has paved the way for stable development of the world economy. 
With the growth of services progressing at a such rate among 
industrialized nations, exchange rates and policy adjustments 
will become more important than ever. 
  [Nakamura] The OECD's forecast is based on the premise of 
the smooth liberalization of the existing 15 sectors. 
Therefore, the liberalization of audiovisual products, maritime 
transportation, and banking were not touched on. The 
liberalization of agricultural products will progress much 
further than it has, but we cannot expect too much; its effect 
will not be so great. 
  [Ogura] Although there are many things that cannot be 
quantified, the recent conclusion will contribute very little to 
the development of the world economy in terms of quantity. Why, 
then, is such a thing necessary? It is because the present 
international trade order is being barely maintained through 
negotiations after doing something--at least something 
accomplished through forward movement. If such negotiations 
fail, or if we do nothing, protectionism, regionalism, or 
selfish unilateralism will prevail. Such a phenomenon will occur 
everywhere and will create confusion. In a sense, the Uruguay 
Round is like a safety valve. 
  [Okumura] What would have happened if the recent 
negotiations 
had failed or if they had not been on the Uruguay Round 
negotiations themselves? We can find the answer by looking at 
the reactions of the markets after the breakdown of the 
Japan-U.S. negotiations. Because of uncertainty about the 
future, the exchange rate rose to 102 yen to the dollar, and the 
stock market index decreased by about 1,000 yen to 18,900 yen 
immediately after the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework 
talks. After a few days, however, the yen returned to nearly 
106 yen as of today, and the Nikkei-Dow Jones average returned 
to the 20,000 level. 
  As is evident from the above figures, the markets became 
calm 
because of the calculation that even if the United States 
threatens Japan with its trade act, either it will not be able 
to carry out the threat or after a time it will adopt a policy 
to urge Japan to make a drastic policy change, no matter how 
serious such a threat may be now, because the United States 
sooner or later has to adopt a policy which conforms to the 
results of the Uruguay Round talks. 
  If the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. framework talks had 
occurred in the absence of the GATT system or the Uruguay Round 
negotiations, there would have been great turmoil in the foreign 
exchange markets and stock markets. Because the GATT system and 
the Uruguay Round negotiations had a tremendous effect in 
calming the situation, their potential supportive power is great. 
  [Nakamura] In this way, it has become possible to bring a 
case such as the Super 301 to the WTO. A system that is 
understandable internationally to some extent has come into 
being. Nobody will think it unpardonable for Japan to appeal to 
the WTO. At least, a system has been established under which 
the general thinking is "The U.S. behavior is rather funny." 
  [Okumura] Will the WTO be strengthened in terms of its staff 
and authority compared to the present establishment? 
  [Ogura] Radically speaking, GATT has not been recognized as 
an international agency so far. In differing from the IMF, GATT 
has a secretariat but has never been a big international agency. 
That may have prompted GATT to recognize the fact that it has 
not been recognized formally, to improve its organization as an 
international agency, to establish a supervisory organization, 
to increase its staff, and to establish more committees. 
  [Nakamura] However, the United States really does not like 
the idea. 
  [Ogura] That is a difficult question. As you have said, the 
WTO has a negative aspect. At the same time, what the United 
States wants the most now is in the fields of services and 
intellectual property rights. Therefore, the United States will 
prefer the WTO with new improvements to a GATT which remains 
unchanged. 
  [Nakamura] Ultimately, the chances are: "The WTO will do. 
We will ratify it through a fast-track process." 
  [Ogura] That has a lot to do with the fact that the WTO 
covers new sectors. It is developing countries that offered the 
strongest resistance to the WTO covering new fields. That is 
because things which are left largely unattended to, such as 
intellectual property rights and medical supplies, will be 
placed under the control of the WTO. It is very likely that 
these countries will venture into the services sector in areas 
such as banking. Another great problem remaining to be solved 
is the movement of unskilled laborers. 
  The Need for Adjustment of Macroproblems and 
Microproblems 
  [Nakamura] What about the problem of developing countries? 
  [Ogura] Opinions differ on this matter. One important 
problem which the recent Uruguay Round did not discuss was "the 
theory of graduation," which was a kind of taboo. However, this 
problem cannot be a taboo after five years. This problem will 
have to be handled in the same manner as other problems. After 
five or seven years, some of the developing countries will 
surpass the so-called industrialized nations in terms of income, 
will they not? 
  [Nakamura] Aside from countries which have graduated or are 
graduating, what did the recent negotiations mean to countries 
which have not yet graduated? Tariffs on fibers, for example, 
were not lowered very much, although tariffs on tropical 
products were lowered a little. On the other hand, however, 
developing countries had to accept the conditions laid down by 
industrialized nations concerning intellectual property rights 
and services. If the labor markets had been opened a little 
more, developing nations would have gained an advantage. I do 
not think that developing countries gained very much. 
  [Ogura] In short, developing countries have been divided 
into 
about three groups. Even aid is not provided for cumulative 
debt-plagued countries; the debts to be paid are growing larger. 
It is such a vicious circle. To the second group of countries, 
aid is more important than trade. Vietnam, for example, is 
receiving aid from various countries, but it is still not yet 
mature in terms of trade. 
  It is about time for South Korea and Taiwan to live on 
trade. 
These countries, which belong to the third group, will gain much 
from the Uruguay Round. The second group of countries, which 
gets along on aid, will have a very hard time, although the 
Uruguay Round is trying to gradually reduce the barriers to 
their export of fibers, for example, which has already become a 
sensitive issue. To countries with a heap of debts, the 
question is surely how much demand there is for their tropical 
products. Japan is in a position to import a considerable 
amount of primary products, and it gives special consideration 
to buying the products of the least developed countries, 
although the amount of its orders is not necessarily great. The 
reason is that Japan could afford this and that it has an 
appropriate stand on placing orders. 
  In the negotiations held on 15 December in Geneva, the 
developing countries said, "Japan has done very well." However, 
when we looked at the contents of the trade products involved, 
we felt ashamed because we had not paid careful attention to the 
so-called tropical products as well. 
  [Nakamura] Is Japan in favor of Taiwan, China, Russia, and 
others joining GATT? 
  [Ogura] The situation will become very unstable if China, 
which has a population of 1 billion, and a giant like Russia 
remain outside of the GATT system. When viewed in perspective, 
it will be better if they follow the international rules. 
  However, there is an opinion that conditions for competition 
should be equalized through the unification of different 
conditions now existing in each country because of the 
intensification of mutual dependence in the world economy. For 
example, an opinion prevails that environmental regulation, 
product liability laws, and labor standards law are different; 
it is unfair to compete under such a situation; therefore, these 
laws and regulations should be unified to some extent. 
  It is all right if the situation stays at this level. 
However, if one says, "The method of the application of the 
antimonopoly law is different, so make it identical," the other 
retorts, "What about the social conditions?" In short, it is 
like unification in Europe. An opinion prevails that conditions 
must be the same to effect a smooth unification. In addition, 
discussions are under way about the North American Free Trade 
Agreement [NAFTA]. Some hold a view which is close to social 
dumping [business seeking to sell goods in foreign markets at 
low prices by unfairly lowering their production costs through 
low wages and poor labor conditions]. What we think of social 
dumping is very important. In a certain sense, the Japan-U.S. 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks were held on the basis 
of this idea. However, if we talk to developing countries, such 
as the least developed countries, about social dumping, they 
react very strongly. 
  Speaking of the post-Uruguay Round era, people concerned 
with 
trade mention the following: environmental, labor, and 
competition policy; in other words, the problem of the 
environment and trade, the labor standards law, and competition 
policy. They say that if competition policies differ greatly, 
the behavior of enterprises will become different. In my 
opinion, such an idea is somewhat problematic. I believe that 
Japan should think about the problem of regionalism, which is an 
issue of longstanding, and the theory of graduation. 
  [Nakamura] I understand that the problems of the 
environment and labor will come up in the post-Uruguay Round 
era. The point is that if the Uruguay Round in its present form 
has a role to play internationally, what is its relationship 
with the regionalism of today? In short, there is NAFTA for the 
United States and the European Union for Europe, and their 
member nations will increase. There is nothing but GATT for 
Japan. That makes the recent conclusion all the more meaningful. 
  Therefore, Japan should rectify the closed nature of 
international trade, although that may be difficult in reality. 
Of course, because Japan itself has a lot to reflect on, it 
should do what it ought to do. Also, it will be splendid if 
Japan becomes a leader in creating a new order or rules for 
international trade. 
  [Okumura] If the WTO is really recognized as a third 
international agency, it will exist alongside the IMF and the 
World Bank. And things will not function well unless these 
three agencies coordinate their work. Following the recent 
Japan-U.S. negotiations, a high-ranking U.S. official seems to 
have led the negotiations to the advantage of the United States 
through the instrument of the exchange rate. How do you assess 
this? I think what the United States did was absolutely wrong. 
If such a thing is permitted, it may lead to a situation 
similar to that of the Great Depression in the 1930's. 
  [Ogura] The trouble is that the group that discusses 
macroeconomics internationally through policy coordination is 
different from the group that discusses trade. 
  [Okumura] Of the international agencies, if the trade sector 
of the WTO and the policy coordination sector of the IMF do not 
cooperate closely, the situation will become all the more 
difficult. 
  [Ogura] It is important for those two international 
agencies, 
or for the people working in them, to discuss things together. 
For example, the two agencies can make use of the process of 
discussions within summit meetings. With the establishment of 
the WTO, if the two agencies act without close cooperation, a 
serious problem will arise. 
  [Okumura] Now, let us suppose that the exchange rate 
overshoots itself. Let us, for example, suppose that the yen 
rises to 100 yen to the dollar through speculative transactions 
of the yen in Japan because of the utterances of a U.S. 
Government bureaucrat or official. It is essentially impossible 
to maintain the rate of 100 yen to the dollar unless there is a 
change in macropolicy. However, when capital transactions are 
conducted on a colossal scale all over the world as they are 
today, and when there are many uncertain elements concerning the 
future, those who engage in foreign exchange speculation by 
utilizing the comments of statesmen will win the game for a 
certain period. Then the psychology of enterprises will be 
shaken. Now, when, for example, Japan changes its strategy and 
decides to manufacture goods in China instead of in Japan, this 
poses the large question of whether that choice is good for the 
Japanese. 
  There is a great difference between plants that are trying 
hard to streamline themselves and cut production costs, and 
international transactions that could wipe out the profits of 
companies overnight in the wake of severe exchange rate 
fluctuations. Therefore, I can fully understand plant 
officials' cries to the effect that they cannot conduct regular 
economic activity unless exchange rates are stable. Unless 
global trade arrangements like the Uruguay Round, world trade, 
and the WTO are connected with exchange-rate stability, they are 
really meaningless to the welfare of the Japanese people. I 
believe that moves toward direct investment are also meaningless 
to the welfare of the Japanese if the exchange rate remains 
unstable. 
  Another problem is a relationship between macroproblems and 
microproblems. Let us suppose that the United States is in a 
hysterical situation because of it being a colossal debtor 
nation, when it has failed to take the most proper policy in the 
matter of macropolicy. Then the United States tends to engage 
in a sector-by-sector approach, which is quite understandable 
emotionally. On the other hand, the creditor nation which 
pushes the United States around is thinking in a coolheaded 
manner and tends to say nothing but that "the other party is in 
a hysterical mood." The country which is being pushed around 
has no alternative but to take a sector-by-sector approach. 
This is exactly what has happened now between Japan and the 
United States. 
  It is the logic of a coolheaded person to say, "It is 
impertinent for the other party to talk about numerical targets" 
and "It is against GATT's rules." People who are in an abnormal 
state in the matter of macroproblems will not listen to such a 
claim. Then, because macroproblems and microproblems begin to 
influence each other, discussion that coordinates the two will 
be necessary. You have engaged in international negotiations. 
What do you think of this? 
  [Ogura] That is the most difficult thing to do, because we 
have no place to hold such discussions except in the preparatory 
stage of a summit meeting. The IMF has recently begun to 
discuss the problem of trade. However, unless the IMF, the 
OECD, and GATT have a joint meeting in a multilateral place, 
they will reach the limits of their resources under the current 
practice. 
  There is another problem between the two countries. For 
example, macroproblems and microproblems are clearly separated 
in the case of Japan and the United States, a case which is very 
problematic. It is a little unusual now for the two countries 
to treat macroproblems bilaterally. We should include Europe to 
make negotiations really multilateral. How to coordinate 
bilateral and multilateral negotiations may be the greatest 
problem of the post-Uruguay Round period. 
  [GAIKO FORUM] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Article by Hideo Tamura; from the "The Hata Administration: </F>
Mounting Problems" series; part two of a three-part series: 
"Japan Should Open Its Market and Give Priority to Consumers: 
Politicians' Leadership of Bureaucrats Indispensable"] 
  [Text] Although the domestic "political vacuum" is to be 
dissolved with the formation of the Hata administration, there 
is no prospect of filling the vacuum which has existed in 
Japan-U.S. economic relations since the February summit was 
broken off. 
<H5>  Japan and the United States Are in a State of Drift </H5>
  It is attributable to the bureaucrats that Japan did not 
compromise at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Noticing 
this, the Clinton administration is assuming an attitude "of 
neglect" toward Japanese bureaucrats. U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR) Kantor has given strict orders to Under Secretary of 
State Joan Spero, Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten, 
and other members of under secretary-class in charge of 
negotiations with Japan "not to meet with Japanese bureaucrats." 
  On the other hand, Japan has not changed its principle that 
"numerical targets should never be accepted" (Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs). An uncompromising argument is spreading 
within the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] 
that "for at least the next two years, while President Clinton 
is in power, it will be impossible to have serious talks with 
the U.S. Government." Sources in the U.S. State Department say 
without doubt that "Japan-U.S. relations are in a state of 
drift." 
  Presently, Japan-U.S. relations are similar to the "game of 
chicken" performed by James Dean and his rival in the movie 
Rebel Without a Cause. In the game, the one who 
takes the most risks becomes the winner. In the movie, a tough 
guy who was supposed to be the winner dies in an accident. In 
the game of chicken there is no real winner. 
  The United States has come through difficult international 
negotiations such as arms reductions with the former USSR, and 
with the end of the Cold War is focusing its attention on the 
Japanese market. Japan has undertaken a policy of concentrating 
authority with the economic bureaucrats. We have now entered an 
era when the two countries, Japan and the United States, compete 
with one another in "economic" field. 
  In the United States, business circles and Congress, which 
are asking that Japan open its market and show objective 
criteria to ensure that its trade surplus is being reduced, are 
also putting pressure on the Clinton administration. In Japan, 
political leaders have been entrusting negotiations to the 
bureaucrats who claim "it is suicidal for Japan to introduce 
macroeconomics and establish numerical targets in an individual 
sector." 
  Anxiety exists in both Japan and the United States. Even 
within the Clinton administration, which has been saying 
positively that "the lack of success in the economic talks does 
not affect Japan-U.S. relations as a whole," a voice is 
beginning to be raised that, "if no agreement is reached at the 
next summit, we are not sure what will become of Japan-U.S. 
relations". 
  According to this logic, the Japan-U.S. summit to be held in 
Naples in July during the G-7 meeting will be the time limit to 
avoid the crisis. 
<H5>  Japanese Politicians Rely on Bureaucrats' Judgment </H5>
  Japanese bureaucrats of the Ministry of Finance and MITI do 
feel anxiety that Asia and the world may be affected should 
discord arise between Japan and the United States, which both 
possess 40 percent of the world's gross national product and 
which are both deepening their interdependent relations in 
international finance and industry. 
  Despite the potential crisis, the United States maintains 
its 
request that numerical targets be established, and the Japanese 
bureaucrats refuse this request. Together with Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, Hata has relied totally on the judgment of the 
bureaucrats since he was foreign minister. 
  The U.S. strategy toward Japan is clear. The United States 
intends to drag down from negotiations those bureaucrats who are 
causing delays in deregulating the Japanese market, who are 
asking that the prime minister increase rather than reduce 
taxes, and who negotiate directly with political leaders. The 
real intention of the United States is to negotiate directly 
with Prime Minister Hata and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is an embarrassment to the 
Japanese bureaucrats with his "ready-to-compromise" attitude 
toward the United States, and by all means to attain visible 
results. 
  However, leading Foreign Ministry officials seem to be 
confident, saying, "Hata even argued down USTR Kantor when 
Kantor claimed that past commercial negotiations were not 
fruitful. It is impossible for Hata to accept numerical 
targets." 
  Ozawa played the role of mediator at the recent cellular 
phone talks, bringing about this political solution. Criticism 
was raised in the United States that "the USTR had cooperated in 
clearing Motorola's outdated analog mobile phone stock." It has 
become necessary for Japan Mobile Communication Co., Ltd. to 
make double capital investments in order to introduce digital 
mobile phones. Bureaucrats claim a "political solution" is not 
necessarily the best solution. 
  Even if the economic framework talks were reopened in a 
similar style, the result would be fruitless and there would be 
no winner. There would be left only a feeling of distrust, and 
Japan-U.S. relations would be further aggravated. It would be 
for the worst if discord is created between Japan and the United 
States, especially in light of the nuclear suspicions involving 
the DPRK, which is likely to require much time to solve, and the 
increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula. 
<H5>  To Open Its Market Is Japan's International Responsibility </H5>
  What is required of the new administration is to neither 
compromise one-sidedly nor refuse totally. Aside from numerical 
targets requested by the United States, it is Japan's own 
international responsibility to "open the Japanese market." It 
is beneficial if government institutions purchase U.S.-made 
supercomputers and medical instruments which are based on fair 
appraisals and which are more competitive than Japanese 
products. It is moral for automobile manufacturers doing 
business in a free market to voluntarily open their network to 
foreign automobile manufacturers and to purchase foreign-made 
parts at a lower price. 
  The United States is asking Japan to open its pension 
market. 
The Pension Welfare Service Public Corporation and investment 
advisory companies also admit that the pension burden of the 
people and enterprises will be reduced if the regulations placed 
by the Ministry of Finance are removed, and if they can freely 
entrust the operation of their public pensions and private 
enterprise annuities to European and American investment 
advisory companies and financial institutions which can earn 
higher returns through investment in assets. In short, the 
capability of the political leaders is to be tested by whether 
or not they can direct the bureaucrats to "give priority to 
consumers," which is a matter of course. 
  Though the Hata coalition government claims it will follow 
the lines of the Hosokawa administration, it is also possible 
that the new administration might adopt an easygoing manner, 
thinking "it is merely playing the role of a transitional 
government." If the new administration follows the same style 
in dealing with the United States, it could cause a calamity. 
The leadership is in a serious position to take responsibility.

  [Text] In hopes of resuming the Japan-U.S. framework trade 
talks, Japanese cabinet ministers and deputy ministers will meet 
their U.S. counterparts one after the other towards the latter 
part of the consecutive holidays in May. Being a minority 
government, the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata 
finds it difficult to hammer out a strong trade policy. On the 
other hand, the United States is faced with the problem that 
further appreciation of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar 
could have an undesirable effect on the U.S. economy. Since a 
prolonged dispute could shake the very foundations of both the 
Japanese and U.S. Governments, there is a possibility that both 
governments may take this opportunity to try to move towards 
each other. 
  Japanese and U.S. officials plan to meet informally, taking 
advantage of international conferences they are scheduled to 
attend. On 6 May, Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade 
and industry, is scheduled to meet Ronald Brown, U.S. secretary 
of commerce, in Warsaw. Subsequently, Sadayuki Hayashi, vice 
minister for international affairs at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], is scheduled to meet 
Joan Spero, U.S. under secretary of state (in charge of economic 
affairs), during an OECD meeting in Paris to be held 9-10 May. 
  As a minister in the new administration in charge of the 
framework trade talks, MITI Minister Hata hopes to gain U.S. 
understanding by explaining the administration's intention to 
promptly carry out deregulation and other plans even while its 
faces difficulties in trying to work out differences between 
ruling and opposition parties. During his meeting with Spero, 
Hayashi is expected to listen to, among other things, specific 
U.S. requests in connection with conditions for resuming 
bilateral trade talks that were recently indicated by U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech. 
  Regarding Japan's new flexible approach, the United States 
considers the approach to be "merely a temporary deferment," 
while the United States plans to "watch how Japan will now 
handle the situation." 
  However, the U.S. Commerce Department and other government 
agencies have shown growing concerns that the bilateral trade 
friction may lead to depreciation of the U.S. dollar, stocks, 
and securities. Thus, there are indications that in some 
quarters of the U.S. Government, there are some officials 
calling for reconsidering the hardline policy the United States 
has taken against Japan. 
  As the series of meetings among Japanese and U.S. officials 
are to be held under such circumstances, it is believed that 
these meetings may turn out to be an opportunity in which both 
Japan and the United States, while taking into consideration 
their respective problems, can coordinate their opinions toward 
an early resumption of the trade talks.

  [Text] As of 2 May, Japan and the United States agreed to 
form a working group composed of officials from both nations to 
settle problems related to the U.S. military bases in Japan in 
the near future. Among the problems is the return of the 
Yomitan auxiliary airfield on Okinawa as a result of scaling 
down the size of U.S. Forces in Japan. This was disclosed by 
several government sources. 
  The accord was reached because the United States has 
indicated its positive position on resolving problems. It was 
also disclosed that the United States has indicated its 
intention to return the 190-acre Yomitan auxiliary airfield in 
particular. If the working group should make any progress in 
its consultations, it is most likely that some of the U.S. bases 
will be returned in the near future. This is a hope that the 
residents of Okinawa Prefecture have cherished for a long time. 
  The pending issues related to U.S. military bases on Okinawa 
are: 1) return of the Naha naval port; 2) return of the Yomitan 
auxiliary airfield; 3) suspension of live-firing exercises 
across Prefectural Highway Route 104. 
  Taking into account the fact that the Okinawa residents have 
strong hope for settling the above-mentioned three problems, the 
Japanese Government has repeatedly requested the United States 
to resolve them on various occasions, such as the Japan-U.S. 
defense chiefs talks. 
  The United States has indicated its understanding in 
principle. However, for various reasons, no accord has been 
reached. For example, the United States is concerned that the 
accord may affect its military training. 
  However, officials concerned from the diplomatic and defense 
authorities of both Japan and the United States met recently to 
talk about measures for settling these problems. As a result, 
they unanimously reached the decision that the Yomitan auxiliary 
airfield may be returned to Japan. And they agreed in principle 
to form a working group to work out concrete measures to settle 
these issues in the future. 
  The formation of this working group is scheduled to be 
announced as an official agreement as early as by the end of 
May. The group is expected to be composed of Japanese officials 
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency and also American officials from the U.S. 
Embassy in Japan and the U.S. Forces stationed in Japan. 
  With the purpose of eventually returning the Yomitan 
auxiliary airfield, the working group will study specific issues 
that the United States has requested. For example, the U.S. 
communication facilities should be maintained, and another site 
for parachuting exercises should be secured to replace the 
original airfield. 
  Moreover, it was decided that the group will also study 
measures to have the Naha naval port returned and live-firing 
exercises across Prefectural Highway Route 104 suspended. Thus, 
following the return of the Yomitan auxiliary airfield, there is 
a possibility that the other two pending issues may be settled 
in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikio Haruna, Kyodo Washington Bureau chief] </F>
  [Text] For the first time since the end of World War II, 
Japan-U.S. relations are about to venture into perilous, 
uncharted waters. Icebergs and reefs lurk in the rough seas of 
the post-Cold War era. Unfortunately, neither our ship nor the 
American one has a discerning captain on board. 
<H5>  An Unmanageable Situation </H5>
  The setting is the White House. The time is the afternoon of 
11 February, the day when Prime Minister Hosokawa and President 
Clinton held a joint press conference at the conclusion of the 
Japan-U.S. summit. There were cheerful expressions on the faces 
of some of Foreign Minister Hata's retinue of top-ranking 
Foreign Ministry officials, in contrast to the somber 
expressions on the faces of the U.S. Government bureaucrats 
lined up at the right side of the podium. Some of them were 
smiling, their faces flushed, possibly from the exhilaration of 
having said no to the United States for the first time in the 
postwar era. 
  With the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the 
scene shifted from diplomatic negotiations between the two 
nations to Japanese and American domestic and international 
politics. Public opinion based on complex emotions came into the 
picture, and the situation became even more unmanageable. 
  In the next act of this drama, the curtain may open on 
severe 
retaliatory measures invoked by President Clinton, including 
sanctions against Japan. But eventually, the President is bound 
to lean toward building a framework for new Japan-U.S. trade 
negotiations. 
  If he does not, given the profound economic interdependence 
between the two nations, a trade war may erupt. And if it 
becomes serious, it will be the American consumer who suffers. 
  To avoid being blamed for the breakdown of the negotiations, 
and to create the impression that Japan is responsible for it, 
President Clinton has no choice but to resort to heavy-handed 
methods. The truth is, though, that the President is aware that 
the United States is also partly to blame for the failed 
negotiations. But first and foremost, he is determined to 
convince the American people that he is a forceful leader. 
  However, by using such methods he is playing a power game, 
and is thereby courting real dangers, for the following reasons: 
  The leaders of both nations agreed to couch the reasons for 
the breakdown in negotiations in a euphemism, i.e., "the 
maturing of a relationship." But there is no hope of building an 
adult relationship of equal importance to both nations any time 
soon. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated any number of times that 
the Japan-U.S. relationship has matured, but his statement was 
later contradicted by Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to 
the United States, who does not believe that it has. 
  Meanwhile, President Clinton is under pressure to 
demonstrate 
strong leadership by instituting a health care system, reforming 
the welfare system, combating crime, and by skillful handling of 
foreign affairs. His methods are completely opposite those of 
former President Bush, who valued establishing good 
communications with foreign heads of state, and who strived to 
avoid "miscalculations" in international political moves. 
  Furthermore, dealings between Japanese and American 
bureaucrats are overshadowed by suspicion, and are far from what 
one would expect of a "mature relationship." 
  During the Cold War, a crisis management system was in 
place, 
which prevented the outbreak of trade wars. But that has 
collapsed, with the "about-face" of the State Department and the 
Pentagon. 
  In Washington, the prevailing wisdom now is that 
Japan-bashing is a safe game to play. The belief is widespread 
that Japan will not implement its own harsh measures in 
retaliation. 
  However, if the Americans decide to impose sanctions on 
Japan 
because of the breakdown in the recent negotiations, the 
reaction from the Japanese public and the Japanese media will be 
far stronger than ever before. There is a distinct danger that 
there will be more emotionally charged hostility between the 
people of the two nations. If the leaders of the two nations err 
in their handling of these problems, they may find themselves 
faced with an unmanageable situation. 
<H5>  The Japan-Is-Different Theory--The Starting Point </H5>
  The "numerical indicators," the main reason for the 
breakdown 
in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, were inspired by the 
Japan-is-different theory. 
  A leading exponent of this argument, the polemicist Clyde 
Prestowitz, chairman of the Economic Strategy Institute, former 
Commerce Department deputy trade representative, and a close 
friend of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, has been giving 
advice to Mr. Kantor privately on a daily basis. 
  Mr. Prestowitz's pet argument is that Japan's social and 
economic systems differ from those of Europe and the United 
States. He argues that, since efforts to use outside influence 
to westernize Japan's systems would cause severe friction, thus 
endangering Japan-U.S. relations, the two nations must agree to 
managed trade. 
  Some time ago, Mr. Prestowitz proposed a "mini Breton Woods 
conference," as an opportunity for Japan and the United States 
to discuss and settle these problems. He was convinced that such 
a conference would be successful, and assumed that Japan would 
respond with enthusiasm. He even told this writer that the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] would likely 
agree to participate, since the ministry would acquire more 
power with managed trade. 
  Economist Laura Tyson, former professor at the University of 
California at Berkeley, also belongs to the Japan-is-different 
camp. She has suggested that the United States deal with Japan 
in a different way than it does with Europe. 
  In her book Who's Bashing Whom? (Japanese 
translation Dare ga dare wo tataiteirunoka?), Ms. 
Tyson describes two types of managed trade: 1) a voluntary 
import expansion agreement (VIE) similar to the Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor agreement, and 2) voluntary export restrictions 
(VER) similar to Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile 
exports to the United States. She indicates that the United 
States should adopt the first type, which would act to stimulate 
trade and competition, rather than the second type, which would 
tend to place constraints on trade and competition. 
  A supplementary document to the Japan-U.S. semiconductor 
agreement expressed the hope that, in 1992, the share of 
foreign-made semiconductors in the Japanese market would rise to 
20 percent. Ms. Tyson has simply justified numerical targets in 
economics terms. 
  President Clinton appointed this offbeat economist chairman 
of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The person who 
holds this position normally acts as a "caretaker of 
macroeconomics." Since her appointment, Ms. Tyson has spoken out 
aggressively about Japan-U.S. trade problems, and has actually 
attended Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  One must also remember that President Clinton has always 
leaned toward managed trade. He has expressed his support for 
managed trade at several Democratic conventions. Moreover, in 
the economic policy statement he issued when he announced his 
candidacy for the presidential election in 1992, he proposed not 
only that the lapsed Super 301 clause, part of a 1988 trade law, 
be revived, but also that it be made more forceful. 
  That same statement makes special reference to President 
Clinton's election promise to create jobs, and emphasizes the 
need to increase exports. It states that 20,000-30,000 jobs are 
created with every $1 billion increase in exports. 
  From its earliest days, the Clinton administration has 
demonstrated its intention to seek the inclusion of numerical 
targets (which derive from the Japan-is-different argument) in 
its negotiations with Japan. 
  Administrators and information specialists in the U.S. 
Government started drafting plans for the new negotiations when 
the Clinton administration took office. During that process, 
former U.S. Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga and other Japanese of 
similar stature were consulted. A U.S. Government source reports 
that their reaction to the draft, which included numerical 
indicators, was "positive." Could someone on the Japanese side 
have spoken irresponsibly? 
  When U.S. Government officials began their preparations for 
the new framework talks with Japan, they took special pains to 
elucidate the differences between Bush and Clinton trade policy. 
Since Clinton's harsh criticism of the Bush administration's 
trade policy had helped him get elected, Clinton's staff didn't 
dare adopt an approach that bore even the remotest resemblance 
to Bush administration policy. 
  It was numerical indicators that made the "difference." 
Clinton's people wanted results. The Bush administration had 
urged Japan to make domestic structural reforms. There was no 
expectation that Japan's trade surplus would decrease in the 
short term. 
  At the press conference held after the talks broke down, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa said that numerical indicators would 
work against his deregulation plan. If Japan makes headway with 
structural reforms, the logic that the Americans are using to 
justify numerical indicators, which is based on the 
Japan-is-different theory, will collapse. 
<H5>  A Series of Blunders </H5>
  During a briefing for White House correspondents, a U.S. 
administration official boasted, "Late last night, I heard 
officials from Japan's Foreign Ministry and from MITI yelling at 
each other. If Japan's government agencies are that much at 
odds, then we've won." 
  This incident took place in July 1993, during the Tokyo 
summit. On that occasion, Prime Minister Miyazawa and President 
Clinton had agreed on the framework for trade negotiations. 
  The error of the above-mentioned assumption became clear 
when 
talks held six months later broke down. The negotiations were 
doomed from the very start. 
  The main point of contention then was the numerical 
indicators, which were the reason why the recent negotiations 
failed. The Japanese side objected to the establishment of 
numerical targets. But then, it was Hisashi Owada, 
administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, who ultimately 
steamrolled MITI opposition. 
  The joint declaration on the framework for the new talks 
established quantitative and qualitative "objective criteria," 
and stated that progress on trade problems would be evaluated by 
these criteria. This was an extremely unpromising start for the 
negotiations. 
  The Americans had proposed setting specific numerical 
targets, but these were fiercely opposed by the Japanese, who 
refused to accept them. An agreement was reached which entailed 
establishing yardsticks, or "objective criteria," and using 
those criteria to measure the extent to which trade problems 
were being resolved. 
  But negotiators from the two nations were ultimately unable 
to agree on the content of those objective criteria, and the 
negotiations were marred by "religious disputes." 
  It is difficult to tell whether the Americans were pressing 
for specific numerical targets, or simply yardsticks (objective 
criteria). 
  Even some of the U.S. Government representatives 
acknowledged 
their failure to make the concepts clear. But the Americans did 
not attempt to hide their suspicion that Japan would not make 
efforts to open its markets unless the United States specified 
targets. 
  Japanese Government officials, on the other hand, were 
worried that if they agreed to numerical targets and were unable 
to meet them, the United States would impose sanctions on Japan. 
  After the negotiations got off to a start, a series of 
blunders was committed by both sides. The errors made by the 
United States were fatal. 
  As previously indicated, the first error was committed by 
Clinton administration officials, who were counting on MITI's 
ultimate acceptance of numerical indicators. 
  But "fundamentalists" at the Foreign Ministry clung 
steadfastly to the principles of free trade. At times they were 
more vehemently opposed to the numerical indicators than were 
the MITI bureaucrats. Furthermore, Japan's public relations 
campaign, which equated the American demands for numerical 
indicators with managed trade and protectionism, paid off. 
Support for Japan's position grew among ASEAN members and in 
Europe. The odds of Japan accepting the numerical indicators 
grew slimmer and slimmer. 
  Second, the political situation in Japan had undergone a 
major upheaval. When the Hosokawa government took office in the 
summer of 1993, the negotiations actually came to a halt. The 
Clinton administration had decided to wait and see how Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's reform plans progressed. Formal negotiations 
resumed in October. 
  In the meantime, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who had 
been harshly critical of Japan, himself became the target of 
criticism from some administration officials, and was replaced 
as chief negotiator for the Japan-U.S. trade talks by Bowman 
Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy. 
  At the Japan-U.S. summit held in New York in September, 
President Clinton flattered Hosokawa, saying that he held the 
prime minister in high esteem, and mentioning the rapport he 
felt with him since both men were former governors, and both had 
been elected because of their commitment to reform. 
  Obviously, Prime Minister Hosokawa read too much into 
Clinton's words. The fact that Hosokawa dispatched his diplomacy 
"ace," Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France, to confer 
with President Clinton and Vice President Gore shortly before 
the negotiations were to begin, and to explore the possibility 
of postponing an agreement, belies his overconfidence. The 
Hosokawa government was totally ignorant of President Clinton's 
strategy, that is, his desire to demonstrate his leadership 
abilities by accomplishing his political agenda. 
  Third, the Americans had overestimated the reform-minded 
Hosokawa. Late last year, a U.S. Government official who is well 
versed in Japan-U.S. relations, asked me if Administrative Vice 
Minister for Finance Saito was going to be fired. Some American 
administrative officials interpreted the resignation of MITI's 
Industrial Policy Bureau chief Naito as a sign that the Hosokawa 
government was wresting power from the bureaucrats. They 
extrapolated further that Vice Minister Saito and Kazuo Ogura, 
the Foreign Ministry's Economic Bureau chief, might also be 
forced to resign. Most of this was wishful thinking, for the two 
men are viewed as tough negotiators, but the rumor spread. 
  A statement made by Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of 
international trade and industry, in which he acknowledged the 
closed nature of Japan's markets, and another made by Foreign 
Minister Hata, that might possibly be construed as meaning that 
he would accept the numerical indicators, buoyed the Americans' 
hopes. 
  But the truth is that Hosokawa, who has far fewer 
specialists 
in government affairs at his disposal than did his predecessor, 
Kiichi Miyazawa, became increasingly dependent upon the 
bureaucrats. Furthermore, Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] had cooperated with former 
Ambassador Armacost in the latter's attempts to solve Japan's 
"international contribution problem," and had become a valued 
ally of the United States. But this time Ozawa sided with the 
Finance Ministry in its tax cut plan, and demonstrated his 
support for a consumption tax increase. This shift was a painful 
blow to the Americans, who were opposed to these measures. 
  Toward the end of last year, when it became clear that the 
negotiations were going to be an uphill battle, the U.S. 
Government stepped up its attacks on Japan's bureaucrats, and 
plotted to remove Hosokawa from their clutches. This proved to 
be a less than brilliant plan, strategically speaking. 
<H5>  Increasing Suspicion </H5>
  Japan-U.S. trade negotiations have begun to take on the 
atmosphere that prevailed during the arms-reduction negotiations 
between the United States and the USSR. The setting of numerical 
indicators and the announcement of the intention to keep a close 
watch to ensure they are met are reminiscent of the Reagan 
administration's demanding that the Soviet Union drastically 
reduce its nuclear facilities and allow detailed inspections. 
Other similarities crop up in the Americans' criticism of the 
conservatism of Soviet bureaucrats and their hope that Gorbachev 
and other Soviet politicians would go along with the American 
policy. 
  Moreover, the Americans are increasingly suspicious that 
promises spelled out in trade agreements will not be honored. 
For instance, between 1991 and 1993, after agreements were 
concluded between the two nations on paper and glass products, 
not only did the foreign market share not increase, but it fell 
from 4.3 percent to 4 percent for paper, and from 11 percent to 
5.9 percent for glass. Though 33 trade agreements have been 
signed between the two nations since 1980, Japan's trade surplus 
has continued to mount, as has the Americans exasperation. 
  The Japanese, faced with the threat of sanctions if they 
agreed to numerical targets and were unable to meet them, were 
not prepared to take that risk. An attachment to the Japan-U.S. 
semiconductor agreement signed by (then) Ambassador to the U.S. 
Matsunaga merely expresses the hope that the market share for 
foreign-made semiconductors will rise to 20 percent. Yet Japan 
was later accused of having reneged on the agreement, and there 
was talk of imposing sanctions. 
  The fact is that there were some hardliners in the U.S. 
Government who insisted on including numerical targets in the 
Japan-U.S. trade agreement, no matter what, and on imposing 
sanctions if those targets are not met. 
  Furthermore, a bill proposed by Senator Baucus and 
Representative Matsui, concerning the observance of trade 
agreements, is now being deliberated in the U.S. Congress. If 
this bill is passed, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office will 
have the power to determine whether trade agreements have been 
adhered to and, if they have not, to impose sanctions by 
invoking Super 301. The foundation is being laid for a system 
that would make it difficult for Japan to sign agreements that 
contain specific targets. 
  According to research on the results of past U.S.-Japan 
trade 
agreements, U.S. exports to Japan have increased. Another 
report, issued by the Congressional Research Service, states 
that exports to Japan increased by approximately $4.9 billion 
per year as a result of trade agreements concluded between 1985 
and 1990. It states further that if all of Japan's import 
barriers were removed, an increase in excess of $10 billion per 
year could be expected. Moreover, research done by the private 
research organization, the International Economic Research 
Institute, suggests that if Japan's markets were completely 
liberalized, U.S. exports to Japan would increase by as much as 
$8.9-18.2 billion. 
  Reports like these prompt the Japanese to counter that the 
closed nature of Japan's markets is not the one and only reason 
for the trade imbalance. 
  However, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan for 1993 reached 
the monumental figure of $59.3 billion, reflecting a 
macroeconomic imbalance. Since allowing this one-sided imbalance 
to continue unchecked is not a wise strategy, Japan will have to 
come up with some sort of policy, one that produces results. 
  Once the Clinton administration had recorded some successes 
on the economic front, for example, recovery from the recession 
and a decline in the unemployment rate, it began to feel 
vulnerable to attacks for its failure to decrease the trade 
deficit. It sensed pressure to produce evidence of its efforts 
to do so, for Congress and for the American people, by 
introducing numerical targets into negotiations with Japan. 
  During the Cold War, when negotiations stalled, there was 
always a "referee" who would step in. The referees were the 
National Security Council, the State Department, and the 
Pentagon. On many occasions these referees cited the strategic 
importance of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and supported 
Japan by holding the economic branches of the government at bay. 
  But during the recent negotiations, not one high-ranking 
government official expressed support for Japan. Even Secretary 
of State Christopher, after he had conferred with Foreign 
Minister Hata, expressed his dissatisfaction that no progress 
was being made in the trade negotiations, and dismissed Japan's 
economic recovery measures, alluding to their "disappointing 
content." 
<H5>  The Unfinished "Japan Paper" </H5>
  Last spring, the Clinton administration decided to do a 
basic 
review of Japan-U.S. relations. It instructed the relevant 
government branches to hold discussions, and to publish the 
results in a "Japan paper." 
  But at those conferences, the Pentagon did not come out as 
Japan's protector, as it had in the past. In fact, the tenor of 
discussions about Japan's defense within the Pentagon has 
changed. For instance, at one time the introduction of landing 
craft, scheduled for the next defense budget, might have been 
welcomed, as they could be expected to contribute to 
peacekeeping operations. However, during last year's 
discussions, doubts were expressed about expanding Japan's 
offensive capabilities. 
  Some U.S. Government officials have voiced, albeit 
unofficially, their reservations about Japan's use of plutonium. 
Still others have expressed their concern that, with the decline 
in the importance of security in the relationship between the 
two nations, and with the possibility that North Korea possesses 
nuclear weapons, Japan may also become a nuclear power. 
  However, the "Japan paper" remains unfinished. The United 
States is still undecided about Japan's strategic role. 
  Thus, the Clinton administration may cause serious 
disruption 
of Japan-U.S. relations if it imposes economic sanctions on 
Japan. 
  Before the Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton is reported 
to have assiduously studied suggestions sent to him by his close 
friend Derek Shearer, former deputy under secretary of commerce, 
and by Glen Fukushima, director of market development for 
AT&amp;T. 
These suggestions assailed the unfortunate U.S. approach to the 
Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. They also proposed establishment 
of a Japan office within the White House, which would 
concentrate on U.S.-Japan problems. President Clinton underlined 
passages he considered especially relevant and made copies of 
them, distributing them to the staffs of U.S. Trade 
Representative Kantor and Secretary of Treasury Bentsen. The 
President, who for many years has valued Mr. Fukushima's 
expertise, realized after reading his suggestions, that the 
negotiations had failed, even before the summit. 
  President Clinton will probably order a review of the 
Japan-U.S. framework talks. But before that, he is likely to 
invoke sanctions in order to maintain his image of leadership. 
  Such sanctions may very well be carefully calculated and 
extremely limited. But if the President fails to make efforts 
toward mutual understanding between the two leaders, and if he 
provokes a hostile reaction from the Japanese people, it may be 
difficult for Japan to agree to negotiations for a new trade 
framework. In that case, the hostility will increase, and 
Japan-U.S. relations will be thrown into turmoil.

<F P=106> [By Yomei Tsuji] </F>
  [Text] Khafji (Saudi Arabia), 27 Apr -- On 27 April, a 
Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] 
delegation, the first ever to visit Saudi Arabia, completed its 
visit. In addition to expressing dissatisfaction that Japanese 
companies are making only limited investment which are directly 
linked to employment, Saudi Arabia criticized Japan for 
withdrawing from a planned joint venture to refine Saudi crude 
oil in Japan, calling for resumption of negotiations on the 
project. Saudi Arabia is a leading figure in the Middle East, 
and Japan relies on it for half of its oil. Since Saudi Arabia 
is important to Japan in terms of securing energy, it seems 
Japan needs to take strategic steps in dealing with Saudi Arabia 
during ordinary times to strengthen mutual ties. 
<H5>  Unusual Meeting With King </H5>
  Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa met with King Fahd, who 
has 
absolute power in Saudi Arabia, at 2230 on the evening of 25 
April. After waiting several hours after receiving an 
unexpected call, Hiraiwa was led to a meeting room in al-Yamamah 
Palace in Riyadh. It is unusual for the king to meet an 
ordinary citizen. 
  The king took up the issue of refining crude oil in Japan as 
the only concrete subject for discussions at the meeting, 
saying: "Although the withdrawal might have been an inevitable 
decision made by specialists, I hope Japan will study it again 
at an appropriate time." 
  Saudi Arabia, which attaches importance to the subsidiary 
sectors of petroleum projects, worked with Nippon Oil Co. Ltd., 
Japan Energy Company, Arabian Oil Co. Ltd., and other Japanese 
oil companies for two years to study the possibility of refining 
crude oil in Japan. It was part of Saudi Arabia's Asian 
strategy. Because of this, Saudi Arabia's irritation is strong. 
  Moreover, since an agreement which gives Arabian Oil Co. 
Ltd. 
the right to produce oil in the Khafji oil field in eastern 
Saudi Arabia will expire in 2000, Hiraiwa asked the king to 
extend the terms of the agreement, saying: "I hope we will be 
able to keep the agreement as a symbol of friendship between the 
two countries." In response, the king gave a blunt answer, 
saying: "We will study it." 
  We could feel in the king's response the possibility that 
Saudi Arabia may use the issue of extending the term of the 
agreement for resumption of negotiations on the oil refinery 
project. 
  On the other hand, during his meeting with Hiraiwa, Industry 
and Electricity Minister Abd al-Aziz Abdallah al-Zamil 
criticized Japan, saying Japan made only five investments in 
Saudi Arabia before 1985. He then gave Hiraiwa a booklet 
containing a list of 120 Saudi Arabian joint ventures with 
foreign companies. The booklet also contains a list of Saudi 
Arabian companies which are seeking joint venture partners in 
different areas, including food and chemical projects. At the 
end of the meeting, Minister Zamil said: "I am sure this 
booklet will help Japanese companies save about five years of 
research time." 
<H5>  Growing Population and Financial Difficulties </H5>
  Saudi Arabia is seeking joint ventures at home because of 
its 
rapidly increasing population and financial difficulty. 
  After the oil crisis of the 1970's, which created huge 
income 
for oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia emphasized the need to 
improve social capital, and the level of medical services 
improved significantly. Because of this, the infant mortality 
rate sharply decreased and the population increased rapidly. 
About 20 percent of the Saudi population is less than 20 years 
old; difficulty in finding jobs has become a problem. 
  Unlike before, government-affiliated organizations are no 
longer employing people. While national revenue continues to 
decrease due to low oil prices, expenditures--including 
expenditure for the Gulf war, weapons cost, and subsidies for 
daily goods--are continuing to grow. Saudi Arabia continues to 
suffer a deficit. The budget for this fiscal year was cut by 
about 20 percent from that of the previous year. 
  Nevertheless, apprehensions in Islamic society will grow 
if the unemployment rate of young people increases. Eventually, 
it may weaken the foundation of the royal government. 
  Foreign Minister Saud, who is a member of the royal family, 
asked Hiraiwa to understand Saudi Arabia's difficult position, 
saying: "Iraq is still a difficult country to deal with. The 
Khomeyni line continues in Iran. Middle East peace with Israel 
is not progressing either. I hope Japan will fulfill its 
political role as well." 
<H5>  More Important Than Rice </H5>
  It seems Saudi Arabia is not as attractive as East Asia to 
those Japanese companies asked to invest in Saudi Arabia. Many 
Japanese businessmen stress the difficulty of investing in Saudi 
Arabia, saying: "The Saudi market is small, and we do not feel 
comfortable with Islamic rules." 
  Hiraiwa states: "The Japanese economy's weakest point is 
energy. We have to be prepared for a tight oil supply and 
demand, which will come sooner or later. It is more important 
than rice." After his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, Hiraiwa 
said: "I would like to ask Keidanren's member companies and the 
government to map out measures to promote investment in and 
provide technological cooperation to Saudi Arabia. We will 
reexamine the possibility of refining Saudi oil in Japan." 
  Hiraiwa, who will step down as Keidanren chairman in May, 
stated: "I will not be able to free myself from energy and 
electricity projects for the rest of my life. I would like to 
hand over to my successor (Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota 
Motor Corporation) issues like the projects with Saudi Arabia." 
He is willing to remain active as one of the "people concerned 
with resources" in the financial world.

  [Text] At the East-West economic, industry and trade 
ministers' conference opening in Poland on 6 May, Minister of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] Eijiro Hata is set to 
announce that Japan will resume underwriting insurance on trade 
with Poland. This was revealed by a MITI source on 3 May. 
  Trade between Japan and Poland has been slow since 
underwriting of trade insurance was suspended three years ago. 
By reviving the trade insurance, the minister wants to show 
that Japan's willingness to assist East Europe in their efforts 
to develop market economies has not changed. 
  MITI has decided to resume underwriting insurance in the 
belief that Poland has come out of its economic worst and the 
risk of doing trade with the country has decreased. The 
ministry does not intend to set ceilings on the amounts of 
insurance to be underwritten.

  [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice 
Minister Shigeto Nagano (a member of the House of Councilors 
from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]) said: "I believe the 
Nanjing atrocity [Nankin gyakusatsu] is a fabrication." In 
reaction, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], stated on 4 May: "Nagano's 
remark raises questions about his qualifications as a cabinet 
member. The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his 
remark. His remark carries a heavy responsibility." Kubo made 
it clear the SDPJ will hold Nagano and the Hata cabinet 
responsible for the controversial remark. With regard to the 
Nanjing atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers during the 
Pacific War, the Tokyo High Court admitted the occurrence of the 
event in its ruling on the Ienaga textbook trial in October 
1993. China is expected to react against, and the Hata cabinet 
will certainly be hard-pressed to deal with, the justice 
minister's controversial remark. 
  Commenting on the MAINICHI SHIMBUN report, Kubo lashed out, 
saying: "There is much evidence that substantiates the Nanjing 
atrocity. Denying the atrocity perpetrated by Japanese soldiers 
is tantamount to denying Japan's war of aggression. His remark 
is based on a wrong position. On what ground did he make it? 
The Hata cabinet should be held responsible for his remark, and 
questions about Nagano's qualifications as a cabinet member 
should be raised." 
  During the interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Justice Minister 
Nagano said: "It is wrong to view the Pacific War as a Japanese 
war of aggression." Kubo took this part of his remarks 
seriously. Noting that former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
definitely stated that "it was a Japanese war of aggression and 
a wrong war," Kubo stressed: "A minister of the Hata government 
that is supposed to have succeeded the Hosokawa government made 
clear his view that flatly denies former Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's view. We have no choice but to think that the 
character of the coalition government has changed."

<F P=106> [Interview with Mutsuki Kato, minister of agriculture, </F>
forestry, and fisheries, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Interview 
With Hata Cabinet Members in Charge of Economic Matters" series; 
one of two interviews comprising second part of series: "Public 
Debate on Rice Prices"] 
  [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Following the recent uproar 
over rice, the people have intensified their criticism of the 
current food control system. 
  [Kato] But I think the food control system helped settle the 
confusion at an early date. It seems the concept of staple food 
is not common in the United States and European countries. I 
think it is Japan's characteristic concept. The recent uproar 
was the event which made us reaffirm the importance of a stable 
supply of rice. Because rice is storable, I would like to 
promote arguments about storing rice from now on. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When you were farm minister in 1986, 
you asserted that the essence of the food control system be 
maintained. 
  [Kato] I would like to back down a little from that position 
and say the basis of the food control system should be 
maintained. Japan has accepted minimum access of rice (minimum 
import quota); as such, we do not say no to everything. I will 
think things over by taking a different position from that which 
I took before. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you mean you will promote reform 
of the food control system? 
  [Kato] I would like to promote agricultural administration 
in such a way that it benefits the people. On the other hand, I 
have to consider two issues, which are, ensuring a stable food 
supply and heightening farmers' will to farm. We are now in 
difficult times, far more difficult than when I was farm 
minister before. Also, because the Hata cabinet is a minority 
government, it is certain to have tough times. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion about rice 
prices? 
  [Kato] The government-purchased rice is priced at 300,000 
yen per ton, while Thai-grown rice is sold at about 40,000 to 
60,000 yen in Thailand. Because the people now eat 
foreign-grown rice, they know about this. The government needs 
to discuss rice prices with the people, while taking into 
consideration rice growers and agricultural organizations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think the imported rice 
sold in Japan is high priced? 
  [Kato] Certainly, it is priced a little high. But because 
the government imported rice as an emergency measure to fill the 
shortage of rice caused by a poor crop at home, high prices are 
inevitable. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it possible to reduce the price of 
rice, which is to be imported next year and beyond, in 
accordance with the minimum access agreement? 
  [Kato] This is a difficult issue. We will have in-depth 
discussions on this issue. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There are many farmers who sell their 
rice on the black market, where rice is traded at high prices. 
  [Kato] They should think about how long the current high 
prices will be maintained. In the near future, the rice crop 
will be average. I hope farmers will realize this. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The Hata cabinet backed by a minority 
ruling coalition will have to have the Uruguay Round agreement 
ratified by the Diet this autumn. 
  [Kato] We intend to have the agreement ratified by all 
means. This issue concerns Japan's role in the international 
community. Diet members will be asked to act sensibly, and not 
be bound by their positions as ruling and opposition parties.

  [Text] Masayoshi Takemura, representative of Shinto 
Sakigake [Harbinger], granted an interview to NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN on 29 April, and revealed his party's plans to deal with 
the political situation arising in the wake of the launching of 
the minority Hata government. He said while his party's ties 
with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will be 
strengthened, exchanges with Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
members will be stepped up by holding joint study meetings, for 
instance. 
  As far as the question of tax system reform is concerned, he 
said the ruling coalition's target to finalize an agreement plan 
by mid-June should be delayed substantially--until it receives 
the public's agreement. Regarding the zoning of the single-seat 
districts for the House of Representatives election, he said the 
matter should be finalized even if it means the Diet session is 
extended. He thus indicated his party is willing to cooperate 
in having the bill passed by the Diet. 
  Commenting on the Hata government which began on 28 April, 
Takemura said: "It is a Shinseito-Komeito joint government; and 
viewed by the political world, a split-power government." 
Explaining the position of Sakigake--a party which promised to 
cooperate with the government while not joining it--with respect 
to the Hata government, he said: "This is a new situation in 
which the coalition became a minority government after the SDPJ 
bolted from it. There are powerful opposition forces. Once the 
current Diet session closes, and if new policy matters arise to 
be dealt with, we will judge them on a case by case basis after 
fully reviewing them." 
  On the issue of tax system reform, Takemura indicated his 
party would support the basic policy agreement made by the 
coalition parties, saying: "Increasing taxes, primarily 
indirect taxes, is unavoidable." But he noted the coalition 
parties' Tax System Reform Council's work is going slowly, and 
added: "Even if the Hata government were not a minority 
government, there is insufficient time to get public concensus 
on the matter. An inability to meet the target [of mid-June] 
may be unavoidable." He thus gave his view that the government 
should not be too concerned about arriving at an agreement on 
the matter by mid-June and should instead give ample time to 
discussing it. 
  On the electoral district redistricting bill, he said: "My 
view and Prime Minister Hata's are the same. We should get a 
recommendation (from the council on redistricting the House of 
Representatives electoral districts) and act on the bill within 
the current session or an extended session of the Diet, rather 
than wait for the fall session." 
  What he meant was that the bill on redistricting should be 
enacted soon even by extending the current Diet session. He 
emphasized: "I mean to support the government as far as the 
1994 budget bill, budget-related bills, the redistricting bill, 
and political reform programs are concerned." Asked what he 
would do if a no-confidence motion in the cabinet were 
introduced, he avoided giving an answer, saying: "I have had no 
time to think about such a thing." 
  Takemura indicated that a joint floor group formed with 
"Group Seiun" which is made up of defectors from the Japan New 
Party will be registered with the House of Representatives as 
soon as the early May holiday season ends. He also suggested 
the possibility of additional defectors from the Japan New Party 
joining the joint floor group. Questioned on the much 
talked-about idea of Sakigake forming a larger joint floor group 
with the SDPJ, he said: "Views within my party have not yet 
been finalized," but added: "The SDPJ was a partner at the time 
of the Hosokawa government; the two are of a similar position. 
We should get closer together." He said his party would 
cooperate closely with the SDPJ in the Diet. 
  Asked about political techniques used by Shinseito and 
Komeito, Takemura indirectly criticized Shinseito Secretary 
General Ozawa and his people, saying, "They are different from 
us in the way they think and act. I am disappointed in various 
ways."

<F P=106> [Article in four installments by reporters Shuzo Mochida, </F>
Midori Matsushima, Ko Hirai, Seiichi Nakamura, and Go Soga] 
<H5>  [15 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Yamagishi Claims He Was "Double-Crossed by 
Prime Minister"; Labor Moves Faster Than SDPJ Toward Tripolar 
Setup 
  "The pace of political realignment is fast." "We must 
eventually form a new party by uniting the liberal forces of the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and the Democratic 
Socialist Party [DSP]." 
  The four chairmen, Morishige Goto of All-Japan Prefectural 
and Municipal Workers' Union [Jichiro], Eiichi Yokoyama of Japan 
Teachers' Union [Nikkyoso], Kyuji Sonoki of Japan 
Telecommunications Workers' Union [Zendentsu], and Mototaka Ito 
of Japan Postal Workers' Union [Zentei], met on the evening of 8 
February at the "Yama-no-Ue Hotel" in Kanda, Tokyo. At noon that 
day, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosakawa had just withdrawn the 
plan for the national welfare tax that he had personally 
proposed. "The power of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito is too strong." The four chairmen were in agreement on 
the above-mentioned views. 
  Ten days earlier, the political reform bill to install the 
combined small-constituency and proportional representation 
systems had passed the Diet. How should Rengo and the 
independent industrial unions handle the elections? How can we 
keep up with the Shinseito-Komeito bloc while maintaining the 
coalition regime? The attention of labor leaders, who took pride 
in having "supported the SDPJ with both money and personnel," 
was turning from the "SDPJ" to a "new political force." 
<H5>  Triggered by Tax Reduction Issue </H5>
  The "tripolar setup proposal," with the SDPJ-DSP liberal 
group as the axis and Rengo's industrial unions, formerly 
affiliated with Sohyo [General Council of Trade Unions], as the 
nucleus, took on a sense of reality as a result of the income 
tax reduction and consumption tax hike issues. 
  "I believe there is someone who is saying various things to 
the chairman, but he is mistaken." 
  On the evening of 16 December 1993, when coordination was in 
the final stages as to whether the FY94 budget should be 
compiled before the yearend or carried over to this year, Ichiro 
Ozawa, Shinseito's acting secretary general, made the above 
remark to Rengo chairman Akira Yamagishi and Etsuya Washio, 
secretary general, who were pressing for the "yearend." 
  Immediately before this, Ozawa had strongly demanded the 
removal of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura to Prime 
Minister Hosokawa at his official residence. By "someone who is 
saying various things," he meant Takemura who was advocating 
compilation by yearend. 
  Ozawa said: "If the compilation is to be completed before 
yearend, the consumption tax must be considered so the SDPJ, 
too, will be in a predicament. I am concerned about that." 
  Yamagishi said, "I do not think we have to rely so much on 
what the Ministry of Finance says." 
  The gap was not bridged. 
<H5>  Oppose Ozawa and Ichikawa </H5>
  On 9 January 1994, Yamagishi stated on a TV program that, "a 
new nonconservative, liberal party should be formed," and 
suggested Hosokawa and Takemura, as well as Takahiro Yokoji, 
Hokkaido governor, as leaders of the new party. When asked how 
about Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, Komeito secretary general, 
Yamagishi replied, "I'm not even considering them." 
  This was not the first time that Yamagishi mentioned the 
"tripolar setup." He had mentioned that on a TV program 
immediately after formation of the coalition government last 
summer. However, at that time, he had notified the Ozawa group 
beforehand that "they shouldn't be too concerned." At the timne, 
Yamagishi was facing the election for Rengo chairmanship so he 
probably wanted to indicate to union members that he was 
distancing himself from Shinseito. However, the tripolar setup 
proposal early this year came as a "surprise." 
  Then came the uproar over the national welfare tax. 
Yamagishi 
said "he felt as though he was double-crossed by the prime 
minister," and called an emergency executive committee meeting 
of the Rengo in response to the requests of Takemura and SDPJ 
chairman Tomiichi Murayama. After confirming that opinions 
favored "separating tax reductions from tax increases," 
Yamagishi opposed the course set by Ozawa and Ichikawa. Takemura 
told his aides that "the schema has now been designed for a 
confrontation between Rengo and Soka Gakkai, both of which have 
national organizations." 
  The "tripolar proposal" gained momentum. On 16 February, a 
little more than a week after the meeting of the four industrial 
labor union chairmen, Masatada Kitagawa, deputy secretary 
general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and one of the 
leaders of the group prepared to leave the party, visited 
Yamagishi. He said, "In that event, we want the support of 
Rengo." 
<H5>  Working on Yokoji, Too </H5>
  Chairman Goto of Jichiro had dinner with Governor Yokoji on 
23 February. "Multiple leaders will have to share 
responsibilities in the new political entity. You are one of 
them." Yokoji stated that he planned to participate actively 
after the budget was approved by the Hokkaido prefectural 
assembly and, on the following day, he was also persuaded by 
Yamagishi that, "political reorganization will proceed even if 
you are not there but it would be better if you are." 
  At a Chinese restaurant in Akasaka in the evening of 2 
March, 
political department chiefs of 10 industrial-labor unions, 
including Jichiro and Nikkyoso, six Diet members of the Sakigake 
[Harbinger] new party, including Hidemasa Tanaka, former prime 
minister's special assistant, and five young SDPJ Diet members, 
as well as former SDPJ Diet members, met for the first time. 
  Listening to the remarks of a Sakigake Diet member (formerly 
LDP) that, "until a year ago, we were like enemies; times have 
changed," Yoshito Senya, former SDPJ Diet member, felt somewhat 
concerned about the fact that "labor unions were moving much 
faster than the SDPJ." 
<H5>  [16 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Repetition of "Piggyback Rides"--Labor Unions 
Tire of Supporting SDPJ 
  "It is necessary to develop the power to take over the 
government." 
  In the fall of 1991, when the SDPJ formed a "shadow cabinet" 
claiming "it would become the ruling party," a request for 
political fund support was made confidentially to the "Sohyo 
center" by Tanabe's executive staff. 
  Financially endowed Jichiro, Zentei, Zendentsu, and Nikkyoso 
ultimately advanced approximately 80 million yen. Actions aimed 
at breaking away from the image of a "labor union party" were 
dependent again on labor unions. 
  "Riding piggyback all the way"--that is how a certain 
industrial union leader sarcastically described the relationship 
between the SDPJ and labor unions. 
  In last year's general elections, "the labor union council 
for unity with the SDPJ" collected approximately 450 million yen 
from participating independent unions and presented the money to 
the party. Because of the ceiling established in the Political 
Fund Control Law, the party treated most of the money as "loans." 
<H5>  "Loans" Advanced in Each Election </H5>
  Actually, during the days of the "Sohyo Center" and "Sohyo," 
precedidng bodies of the "unity council," much larger amounts of 
"loans" had been advanced whenever elections were held. However, 
with the disbandment of the lending bodies, these loans were 
"dissolved" (SDPJ official). These were actually political 
contributions and there was no intention to repay. 
  In the 1992 upper house elections, each industrial union 
gave 
approximately 80 million yen to the party for every union 
candidate it put up in the proportional representation 
districts. With multiple organizational candidates to sponsor, 
industrial unions exceeded the ceiling of the control law. There 
were cases when "a portion was kept confidential" (a certain 
industrial union leader). 
  For the labor unions, these "political actions" were aimed 
at 
obtaining personal benefits, of course, such as increasing the 
wages of government workers and securing a "shortcut" to meeting 
various demands concerning "systems and policies." 
  However, the "productive results" of the SDPJ under the 
LDP's 
one-party rule were inevitably limited to such actions as "we 
forced replies from cabinet members" or "we forced supplementary 
resolutions to be appended." As one industrial union leader puts 
it, "ultimately, it was only a fight for conditional gains." 
  Significant environmental changes were occurring to directly 
affect labor unions which had begun to feel a sense of "fatigue" 
in their relations with the SDPJ. The 1987 partition and 
privatization of the Japan National Railways [JNR] shocked 
Zentei, which was a target of similar privatization, and 
Zendentsu, which feared partitioning. A sense of crisis spread 
that, "repetition of the failure of the National Railway 
Workers' Union [Kokuro] must be avoided." 
  Furthermore, Rengo's establishment in 1989 hastened changes 
in the awareness of former Sohyo affiliates, particularly the 
leaders of the Government and Public Workers' Union [Kankoro], 
which had been the nucleus of SDPJ support. A Jichiro executive 
states: "I personally felt the perceptions being held by private 
sector labor unions. Private sector members, who can be abruptly 
handpicked for dismissal, have a different sense of realism. I 
was impressed by their careful consideration of the future 
outlook of the economy and enterprises." 
<H5>  Disappointment Becomes Overwhelming </H5>
  Moreover, union members were definitely "detaching 
themselves 
from the SDPJ." A poll survey showed that "support for SDPJ" did 
not even reach 20 percent. Funds for the SDPJ had been collected 
from these union members as "political enlightenment funds" or 
"political struggle funds." 
  The shadow cabinet was the topic of conversation for a 
while, 
with such assertions as, "conditional approval of the `Rising 
Sun,'" but it soon lost its popularity. In early 1992, labor 
unions refused to give financial support to the second shadow 
cabinet, saying "it was useless." 
  In June of that year, the process of establishing the UN 
Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation Law, during which the 
SDPJ used delay tactics and submitted Diet members' resignation 
requests, made the labor unions' disappointment an overwhelming 
one. "We were truly disappointed because resignation requests 
were submitted, but no one left the Diet members' quarters" 
(leading industrial union executive). 
<H5>  "Disbandment" Not Forecast </H5>
  In the upper house election the following month, all of the 
candidates officially designated by Rengo were defeated. During 
that summer, the leaders of the main industrial unions, 
including Etsuya Washio (Japan Federation of Iron and Steel 
Workers' Union [Tekko Roren]), Kyuji Sonoki (Zendentsu), 
Mototaka Ito (Zentei), Teruhito Tokumoto (Federation of Japan 
Automobile Workers' Union [Jidosha Soren]), Yasuo Iwayama 
(Japanese Federation of Electrical Workers' Union [Denki 
Rengo]), and Morishige Goto (Jichiro), met for earnest 
discussions on the way support to political parties should be 
handled. 
  From that summer to fall, the participants revealed, one 
after another, the results of the discussions in speeches to 
general meetings of various industrial unions. 
  "The time might come for the SDPJ to disband." "It is 
impossible to form a replacement party by realigning the 
existing political parties." "Setting up a new party of 
`like-minded politicians' has the most potential." 
  However, they did not have a firm outlook for the future. 
  With the split of the LDP's Takeshita faction at yearend, 
the 
political world moved suddenly to a change in governmental reins 
and election system reforms, and no one among the labor leaders 
anticipated that formation of a "new party" would become a 
realistic task so soon. 
<H5>  [17 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Successful in Longstanding Wish To Cooperate 
With Conservatives--Rengo Is Concerned About "Next Scheme" 
  Born in the mid-1930's, the three persons who might be 
called 
the new leaders of the labor circle were telling each other that 
"governmental change cannot be accomplished simply by marshaling 
opposition parties," and had been considering the formation of a 
new force linked to a conservative segment. 
  They are Etsuya Washio, Tekko Roren chairman; Teruhito 
Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman; and, Kyuji Sonoki, Zendentsu 
chairman. 
  On the evening of 14 September 1992, along with Jinnosuke 
Ashida, chairman of the Japanese Federation of Textile, Garment, 
Chemical, Mercantile, and Allied Industry Workers' Unions 
[Zensen Domei], they met with Ichiro Ozawa, who was then the 
representative chairman of the LDP Takeshita faction, at the All 
Nippon Airways hotel in Akasaka. 
<H5>  Leaders' Meeting Was Turning Point </H5>
  When Ozawa explained that "LDP members will probably come to 
agreement on a simple small constituency system," the labor 
union officials objected, saying "no opposition party will 
accept that proposal." Both sides were thinking about "spreading 
the wings" (Washio) of the tie-up, but at this time agreement 
was within grasp but failed. 
  What triggered a change in the labor circle's attitude was 
the meeting between Rengo chairman Yamagishi and Ozawa, which 
took place on 20 February of the following year, following the 
split of the LDP's Takeshita faction in the fall of 1992. Ozawa 
asserted that carrying out the electoral system reform was the 
shortcut to political reorganization. 
  Ozawa: "The LDP has presented a plan. I'd like to see the 
opposition parties submit a plan, too." 
  Yamagishi: "All right. We'll try to do that." 
  Ozawa: "Depending on circumstances, I might leave the LDP." 
  On 22 March, Yamagishi also met with Yuichi Ichikawa, 
Komeito 
secretary general. In response to Ichikawa's statement, "if the 
SDPJ splits and the reformist faction leaves, I want Rengo's 
support," Yamagishi replied, "of course." Three days later, 
Yamagishi met with Morihiro Hosokawa, representative of the 
Japan New Party [JNP], and said, "I plan to take care of the JNP 
from now on." 
<H5>  Support for New Parties in General Elections </H5>
  The labor circle, which firmly believed that "the political 
situation was certain to become fluid" (Sonoki), tried to get 
the SDPJ to move with the tide. The vehicle was the "SDPJ Reform 
Diet Members' Union (Giren)," led by Makoto Tanabe, former SDPJ 
chairman. 
  In the evening of 18 February, immediately prior to the 
Yamagishi-Ozawa meeting, at a gathering which included both 
Yamagishi and Washio, as well as Jichiro chairman Morishige 
Goto, Tanabe had shown a prospectus for formation of the Giren 
in order to "create a force to establish a new political power 
base" and had requested the cooperation of Yamagishi and others. 
  Installed in April, the reformist Giren group worked on the 
party's executive committee to take bold steps toward election 
system reform. Jichiro, Nikkyoso, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko 
Roren, and Denki Rengo collected approximately 20 million yen 
for Giren. 
  Tanabe's group had planned to make Giren the core in forming 
a new mainstream faction, but the goal of the labor circle lay 
further ahead. The aim was to use Giren as one of the filters in 
the "selection process" for election support and to nurture it 
as a "preparatory force to split the SDPJ." 
  "I want the selection process to be dropped." So objected 
Sadao Yamahana, then SDPJ chairman. But Tanabe began to concede 
gradually, "it cannot be helped." 
  While conducting the "selection process," the labor circle 
strengthened its tie-up with the new conservative parties. On 17 
June, the day before dissolution of the lower house, in a 
meeting with Ashida, Hosokawa showed a chart of electoral 
districts and rebuked him for Zensen Domei's election 
cooperation. For some reason, Hosokawa expressed displeasure 
over support for Zensen-recommended DSP candidates in a number 
of electoral districts, though JNP had no candidate. Ashida 
learned at this time that Masayoshi Takemura and others were 
leaving the LDP on the following day. 
  On 25 June, just before the official announcement of general 
elections, leaders of eight industrial labor unions, namely, 
Jichiro, Zendentsu, Zentei, Tekko Roren, Denki Rengo, Jidosha 
Soren, Federation of Electrical Workers' Unions of Japan 
[Denryoku Soren], and Zensen Domei, met in a Tokyo hotel and 
agreed to widen election support to JNP and Sakigake, and even 
Shinseito, bypassing the old lineup of "former Sohyo-SDPJ" and 
"former Domei-DSP." 
  With the subsequent participation of the Japanese 
Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Workers' Unions 
[Zosen Juki Roren], the "Nine Union United Front" performed the 
function of "confidentially manipulating" labor union votes to 
support the election of non-LDP candidates, including those of 
the new conservative parties. 
<H5>  Mixture of Success and Miscalculation </H5>
  The birth of a "non-LDP coalition government" and SDPJ's 
dismal loss of half of the Diet seats... the general elections 
brought a mixture of success and miscalculation to the labor 
unions. 
  With the "Nine Union United Front" as the base, Rengo will 
enter into discussions on forming a new political force that it 
recommends in the second-phase political realignment. Will it be 
a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" alliance that is recommended by former 
Sohyo-affiliates, including Jichiro, or will a coalition 
framework, including the Shinseito and Komeito, be given 
priority? Rengo, which succeeded for the moment in concerted 
actions with conservatives, must face new problems again. 
<H5>  [18 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Tide Changes Abruptly Under Central 
Leadership--Confusion and Opposition Among Local Organizations 
  A gay mood surrounded the 40th anniversary celebration of 
Jichiro's founding, held on the evening of 22 February at a 
Tokyo hotel, to which Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP 
Policy Affairs Research Council, and Yuriko Koike, JNP Diet 
member, were invited. However, four Jichiro "organizational Diet 
members," including upper house members Tetsuo Yamaguchi and 
Sango Sato, were missing. 
<H5>  Aftereffects of "Rebellion" Continue </H5>
  Yamaguchi and his cohorts voted against the political reform 
bill in the upper house plenary session on 21 January, and, four 
days later, the Jichiro headquarters decided to "freeze 
relations" with the four Diet members. Soon thereafter, 
Yamaguchi and his cohorts were notified by the Jichiro 
secretariat that "invitations to the ceremony will be canceled." 
  From the start, the atmosphere was acrimonious at the 
meeting 
of representatives of Jichiro's SDPJ Members' Council held in 
the Makuhari International Conference Hall in Chiba City on the 
evening of the 20th, two days before the ceremony. 
  When upper house member Yubun Ueno, who succeeded as 
"Jichiro's Diet Members' Council chairman" after Yamaguchi's 
withdrawal following the "rebellious" act, remarked that "to 
begin with, Yamaguchi had not been the proper persom to become 
the council chairman," Ichiu Kimishima, secretary general of the 
Nagano prefectural headquarters, retorted, "the same applies to 
you--Jichiro, too, had opposed the small constituency system at 
last summer's general meeting." 
  Subsequently, about 10 regional representatives objected to 
the headquarters' decision, saying "there are relations between 
local regions and Diet members, too, so it was not proper for 
the headquarters to decide on the punishment without consulting 
us." 
<H5>  "Coalition Overvalued" </H5>
  The actions of labor circle leaders, who are steering boldly 
in the rapid current of political reorganization, are being 
watched with skeptical eyes by local labor union bosses. These 
"party activists" of labor unions are the ones who supported the 
SDPJ in elections and Jichiro was truly the nucleus. 
  In late December, after the SDPJ agreed to partial 
liberalization of the rice market, Kimishima, secretary general 
of Nagano prefectural headquarters, protested to other labor 
union leaders and to the three executives of the party's 
prefectural headquarters, that "We shouldn't be forced to go 
along with the party's central headquarters beyond this point. 
Many union members have the same complaint." 
  "Opposition to rice liberalization had been the constant 
pillar of our movement. If a unified candidate is to be put up 
by the ruling coalition party in the future, the banners of 
`constitutional safeguard and peace' might be lowered. If that 
is so, what is the labor union movement for?" 
  At the Zentei central committee meeting on 7 February, when 
chairman Mototaka Ito cautioned that, "political developments 
will unfold under central headquarters' leadership--local 
regions should refrain from acting independently," Isamu 
Hayashi, secretary general of Kyoto District headquarters, 
objected. 
  "The coalition regime is being evaluated somewhat too 
highly. 
To begin with, what kind of a political party is the Shinseito 
or Sakigake? It is not convincing simply to say that the 
decision was made by Rengo." 
  Kyoto does not have a SDPJ representative in the Diet. 
Hayashi, too, thinks that labor unions cannot continue to 
function forever in "support of SDPJ." He says, "Therefore, 
Zentei should concentrate on its basic union activities and stop 
proposing political party support." 
<H5>  Uncertainty About Election Support </H5>
  Former Sohyo-affiliated labor unions in Kagawa Prefecture 
are 
now conducting a signature-collection campaign to oppose hikes 
in the consumption tax rate. Unions are troubled about how the 
significance of SDPJ's entry into the government should be 
interprreted but they are certain the movement to "oppose the 
national welfare tax" has the unanimous agreement of members. 
  In lower house elections, which will change to the small 
constituency system, these labor unions are concerned that they 
might be asked by the central headquarters to support Shigeaki 
Tsukihara, Shinseito Diet member (Kagawa 2d District). Tsukihara 
is a former Defense Agency bureaucrat and was a "defense zoku" 
Diet member during his LDP days. Masahiro Miyake, Jichiro's 
prefectural headquarters chairman, states, "we can never support 
him." 
  On 19 March, Yamagata Prefecture's labor unions, such as 
Zentei and Jichiro, will hold a lecture meeting in Yonezawa City 
on the subject of "constitutional safeguard and peace," with 
House Speaker Takako Doi as the lecturer. Soon after the 
coalition government was formed, planning was started, fearing 
"can peace be preserved by a regime led by Ichiro Ozawa's 
Shinseito?" Feeling uncertain about "future actions" of the 
central union headquarters and the SDPJ, an action committee was 
formed, including conservative elements and youth groups, and 
the support of municipal education committees was also secured. 
  With the realization of the electoral system reform, Jichiro 
and Nikkyoso must conclude their reassessment of the policy to 
"support only the SDPJ" at this summer's general meetings to 
prepare for election campaign support. The move toward formation 
and support of a "SDPJ-DSP liberal" bloc by the former 
Sohyo-affiliated labor unions is their last resort for 
realignment out of consideration for resistance by these local 
organizations to Shinseito, et al. 
<H5>  [19 Mar 94 p 1] </H5>
  [Text] Channel to Government Secured--Will It Lead to 
Better Livelihood? 
  "We will not stage a demonstration today. That is 
unfashionable." 
  Rengo's "Spring Offensive General Rally" was held at noon on 
the 12th in Tokyo's Yoyogi Park. Most of chairman Akira 
Yamagishi's address was devoted to "politics," such as attacks 
on the LDP, which was boycotting deliberations on tax reductions 
and the budget bill. 
  "Is it impossible now to persuade the SDPJ?" In late 
February, when the government was wavering about the cabinet 
reshuffle, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokaea telephoned Yamagishi 
to sound out his feelings. Before the seven-nation ministerial 
meeting on employment (employment summit), which was held early 
this week, Jinnosuke Ashida, representing the Rengo chairman, 
phoned Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and advised 
him that "it would be unwise to send only the labor minister 
from the cabinet." 
<H5>  Spring Offensive Follows Usual Pattern </H5>
  Rengo, which served as one of the driving forces in the 
birth 
of the coalition regime, secured a channel to the government 
that would have been unimaginable during the LDP rule. Even the 
industrial unions are enthusiastic: "The struggle now takes 
place before government policies are announced" (Hideyuki 
Suzuki, chief of Jichiro's political policy bureau). 
  However, within Rengo ranks, dissatisfaction is constantly 
smoldering that "the emphasis is on politics, not economics." 
With labor unions on the government's side, can wages be 
increased satisfactorily and will employment become secure? 
Unless the political realignment leads to better livelihood, it 
might be likened to playing with fire. 
  In the spring offensive, the Rengo executive committee 
proposed "restructuring of the spring offensive," such as 
"changing the batting order" and dispersing the peak struggles, 
centered on the General Federation of Private Railway and Bus 
Workers' Unions of Japan [Shitetsu] and Zendentsu, which have 
been relatively unaffected by the economy. However, the usual 
pattern had to be followd eventually because the industrial 
unions would not consent. 
  As the wage structure becomes fluid with widening 
differences 
in business performances of industrial groups, as exemplified by 
the increase in ratio of tertiary industries, and the 
introduction of the annual salary system, how effective is the 
"showdown tactic" aimed at fulfilling demands by opposing 
management with a united labor front? 
  "The present spring offensive pattern was adopted in 1956. 
This is another version of the `1955 setup.' Spring offensive 
restructuring cannot be carried out unless there is an agreement 
of views with management." This remark was made by none other 
than Yamagishi while facing the spring offensive peak struggle. 
Now that the schema of LDP government and management versus SDPJ 
and labor unions has been overturned, new relationships with 
management must be found. 
<H5>  Policies Still in "Request Mode" </H5>
  From the management side, even statements such as, "except 
for the single item of wage increases, we have no 
confrontational issues with Rengo" (Takeshi Nagano, chairman of 
Nikkeiren [Japan Federation of Employers' Associations] can be 
heard. Conversely, the National Confederation of Trade Unions 
[Zenroren], which strongly supports the Japan Communist Party, 
criticizes that, "by establishing wage demand bases below last 
year's, Rengo showed that it was for labor-management unity." 
  In 1975, Yamagishi headed the "strike for striking rights" 
as 
acting secretary general of the Council of Public Corporations 
and Government Enterprises Workers' Unions [Kororen]. Only 
Yamagishi, with the demeanor of a "fighter," could've taken the 
strongly leftist industrial unions in tow and guided 
labor-political relations thus far. However, the poor showing in 
the spring offensive cannot be explained away simply by saying 
that Rengo is now on the government's side. 
  What are the labor unions, which are now on the government's 
side, going to do hereafter? Recently, there have been heated 
discussions in Rengo ranks that "Rengo policies are still in the 
`request mode'--that must be changed to the `proposal mode.'" 
However, there are hardly any discussions on how to coordiate 
labor union demands and government policies. 
  For example, Zendentsu, which is Yamagishi's base, joined in 
the past with management and the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications to oppose the privatization of Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. [NTT] and is now opposing its 
partitioning. This position is an extension of the old setup 
with the addition of "labor" to the "postal family," i.e., 
"government, bureaucracy, and business," and runs counter to the 
aim of "deregulation" announced by the Hosokawa regime. 
<H5>  Perceptions Differ on Political Participation </H5>
  Will it be the formation of a SDPJ-DSP liberal bloc or will 
emphasis be placed on the framework of a ruling coalition? Even 
before deciding on the course to take in the political 
realignment, there is the problem of bridging the wide gap in 
perceptions between the aggressive view of "Rengo will strongly 
support the new party" (Morishige Goto, Jichiro chairman) and 
conversely, "labor unions should abandon the posture of 
selecting a party and fully supporting it with money and 
personnel" (Teruhito Tokumoto, Jidosha Soren chairman). 
  It seems that the labor circle will require more time to 
locate a new coordinate axis for politics which is undergoing a 
great transformation.
